Since I seem to have started a series:

*   [How to teach film responsibly in a composition class (_The Dark Knight_)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/dark-knight-scene-analysis.html)
*   [How to teach comics responsibly in a composition class (_Watchmen_)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/like-what-i-did-with-the-dark-knight-only-this-time-about-the-fourth-issue-of-watchmenin-making-comics-scott-mccloud-argue.html)

TypePad generated the ugliest URL I’ve ever seen for that second link.  (I only hope that doesn’t somehow reflect its content.)
