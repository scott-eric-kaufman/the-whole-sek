Presented by HumaniTech and the UCI Humanities Center on Friday, 24 October 2008 in [135 HIB](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=humanities+instructional+building,+irvine,+ca&ie=UTF8&ll=33.648554,-117.843795&spn=0.001451,0.002843&t=h&z=19&iwloc=A).  The whole day looks fascinating, but this panel should be a thing of great and terrible profundity:

**(10:45) Blogging and the Academy**

[Eszter Hargittai](http://esztersblog.com/), [_Crooked Timber_](http://crookedtimber.org/)

Tedra Osell, [_Bitch Ph.D._](http://bitchphd.blogspot.com/)

Moderator: [Catherine Lui](http://www.higher-yearning.org/blog.html), UC Irvine

Before you ask: Tedra and I are indeed a [package](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/panel_podcast.html) [deal](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/another_mla_pan.html).  (I considered getting the band back together and asking Bérubé and Holbo to join us, but Singapore's far away 
and Bérubé's [not a blogger anymore](http://www.michaelberube.com/)
.)  My [edgier](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com) side would've been listed, but Eric and Ari's didn't consider margins when they christened this place.

Oh man—when I finish my PhD, am I going to have to list my primary affiliation as my blog until I get a steady job?

Rohan, feel free to repost that CFP here.  In fact, if you don't, I will.  

Adam, the conference organizers decided to do that.  Technically, I'm still with UCI as an instructor, so they _could_ have put that.

_feel free to repost that CFP here_

Good point, Scott--I don't know why I didn't do that right away, it seems so obvious. I'll post it here very soon.
