**Yet.**

Who dare not call this literature?

e.g.?

Great comment box reactions to the eggs.  Little did Orwell know that his single-word diary entries would be the source of (attempted, at least) witticisms later.

But—did anyone call this literature?  People seem to be reading it because they are interested in Orwell, not because the material is supposed to be literary in its own right.  Any well-known author attracts a Gaussian fringe of fans who are wiling to read more and more ordinary material that has been touched by the author’s hand.

They bring good things to life, Adam—wait, I have that backwards.

Rich, I think “attempted” is the key term there.  Four or five of those threads consist entirely of unselfconsciously terrible puns and people replying “Eggcelent! LOL!”

It did make Time magazine’s 100 best blogs, and is up for a Weblog Award for “Best Literary Blog,” which is sort of what I was reacting to here.

You mean somebody already bagged ’_eggcelent_‘?  Damn.

There’s a moving variant on this in Matthew Arnold’s notebooks.  Arnold kept a weather diary, and in the midst of recording “rain,” “rain,” and still more “rain,” he breaks off twice: “Budge!” (the sudden death of his favorite child) and “Budge’s funeral!”  And then back to rain.

I didn’t see too many terrible puns—maybe I skipped them—but there’s a certain wry, minimalist humor in the situation.  Try, I don’t know, [here](http://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/2008/12/18/181238/#comment-2520), [here](http://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/2008/12/11/111238/#comment-2385), [here](http://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/2008/12/04/41238/#comment-2238), [here](http://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/2008/11/30/301138/#comment-2105), or the spam-bot (parody?) [here](http://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/2008/11/29/291138/#comment-2122).  As well as the perhaps only inadvertently funny suggestion that he’s writing “Egg” because he needs to write something every day to practice his craft as a writer.

As for “literary blog”—well, I can see why they couldn’t come up with a better category.

Good lord, it appears I broke this thread by trying to link to R. Crumb’s Eggs Ackely. Who says puns aren’t dangerous?
