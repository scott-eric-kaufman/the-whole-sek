## “This Sandworm anon let flee a fart, as gret as it hadde ben a thundir dent.”

* Wednesday, October 08, 2008 

On this day in 1920, Frank Herbert Jr. was born.  Herbert devoted six years to “researching” what would become the [most popular science fiction novel of all time](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441172717/diesekoschmar-20). I’ve always wondered what counts as “research” when writing a novel.  I can understand the need for writers of hard science fiction to familiarize themselves with the ins and outs of a particular field, but for someone like Herbert, wouldn’t “world-building” more accurately describe his efforts?  I say this because Herbert describes a world in which the mysticism and magic have replaced science and technology.

This time I am [lifting from](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/07/i-wish-that-son-of-a-gun-would-take-that-other-hand-out-of-his-pocket/#comment-14389) [Adam Robert](http://www.adamroberts.com)‘s excellent [_History of Science Fiction_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0333970225/diesekoschmar-20), in which he claims “one of the book’s greatest strengths is its detailed and plausible rendering of the political context” (236).  What Herbert spent six years “researching,” then, was the complex political environs of the interplanetary empire he’d invented because _Dune_‘s reputation as an environmental novel is undeserved.  The overgrown [extremophiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile) who inhabit [Arrakis](http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Arrakis) are [humans from Earth](http://www.last.fm/music/T-Bone+Burnett/_/Humans+From+Earth), but somehow survive on a planet with no viable means to create or sustain an atmosphere.  As Roberts writes:

We may wonder, for instance, how Dune’s atmosphere is oxygenated in the absence of planetary vegetation.  In later books Herbert suggests that the sandworms fart oxygen, which hardly address the problem. \[_Edited to reflect my poor editorial skills, not Adam’s._\]

Indeed, without an atmospheric density in the neighborhood of 1.2 kg/m³ it wouldn’t matter what element those sandworms farted--it would’ve drifted up and away.  And where did all that sand come from anyway?  The most efficient means of producing sand is wave action, but even if Herbert wanted to be inefficient, a little research would’ve taught him that sand requires big rocks and weathering processes.  The geological history of a planet consisting entirely of sand is--will you let me get my geology geek on, please?  The opportunities to do so are few and very far between.  Fine then.  I’ll be mysterious.\*

I don’t mean to diminish Herbert’s accomplishments in _Dune_.  So long as he was alive, the series educated science types about the nuances and niceties of medieval politics.  (The process, if not the history.)  That said, I always found Herbert’s forecast of future history more than a little pessimistic.  Like the [_Terminator_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise)) and [_Battlestar Galactica_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JNTR/diesekoschmar-20) franchises, the _Dune_ sextet pivots on [a war between man and formerly enslaved machine](http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Thinking_machines), the result of which was a return to a pre-computational society.  The [mentats](http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Mentat) are bred--"[Fancy meeting you here, dissertation](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/the_best_quotat.html).  Please GO AWAY."--they are bred to be mathematical savants, and spice mystically allows for interstellar travel sans star-charts.  So, no computers needed.  However, Herbert’s novels seem to argue that a rejection of the modern technology entails a rejection of modern political systems--as if dispensing with the convenience of a calculator is the first sign of feudalism’s revival.

Besides the obvious problem with this--somehow those Athenians managed to be quasi-democratic before the Age of Apple--and despite Herbert’s obvious critique of hierarchy and messianic thought, I can’t help but think the novels engender a nostalgia for certainty in their readers.  We might not know how spice works, but Our Dear [God-Emperor](http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Leto_Atreides_II#Reign_of_Leto_II) surely does.  (Despite having personally and purposely evolved into a human-sandworm hybrid--about which plot-point my dissertation rears its head like [Giant Putin over unsuspecting Alaska](http://www.michaelberube.com/images/uploads/zzzputin.jpg).  So I’ll stop now lest I invite insanity in, slap it on the back, and offer it a brew--which is, yes, how a body feels about a dissertation recently completed.  I hear tell this subsides in time, but so far I’ve felt none of it.)

\* \* \*

\* By which I don’t mean anything like “I sat here trying to think what would have to happen for such a planet to come about--including, but not limited to, a cessation of mountain-building after a period of intense weathering by something other than water, since [water poisons](http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Sandworm#Water_Poisoning) the marvelous beasts who produce the [spice melange](http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Spice_melange) and whose evolution would’ve spanned untold eons.”  I don’t mean anything like that.  I know the answer, I’m simply not in the mood to share.

Gee thanks, Scott (and Adam). _Dune_ was the only one of the _Dune_ series I thought was any good, and now you’ve ruined even that.

The “Ecology of Dune” appendix to the first book shows that Herbert has thought about this more than you (or Adam) seem to let on. He even gives the percentage of gases in the atmosphere “23 per cent oxygen, 75.4 per cent nitrogen, and .023 per cent carbon dioxide--with the trace gases taking up the rest” (496, Berkley trade paperback). He says that sand is mostly a product of worm digestion (497). There are mentions of oxygen being stored in rocks. On p. 499, “A medium worm (about 200 meters long) discharged into the atmosphere as much oxygen as ten square kilometers of green-growing photosynthesis surface.”

So, he’s thought about it. The quibbles are not properly ecological, geological, or atmospheric--merely xenobiological.

Yeah, I didn’t think that Dune was actually so bad, ecologically.  Not like, say, Brian Aldiss, who for far too many of his books favored a weird pseudo-Lamarkian Darwinism full of species trying to evolve in certain ways, species copying other species, etc., as well as the kind of feral jungle in which everything is a super-predator trying to eat everything else that featured in far too much SF of the time.  It’s worse to get a basic process wrong than to get specifics wrong.

I also don’t understand your point about atmospheric density.  As far as I know, whether the atmosphere of a planet drifts away or not depends on its surface gravity, which is a function of mass and size.  (Not quite planetary density, because a dense but very small planet wouldn’t retain its atmosphere.)  There can also be effects a la Mercury if a planet is close to its sun.  But the general atmospheric density of the planet should be produced by nonbiological processes, I’d think, so it would be there for the sandworms to augment with oxygen when they evolved.

The feudalism was one of the worst things about the books, I thought.  SF feudalism hardly ever comes out well.  The various semisecret conspiring power groups were good, but the whole thing always seemed a bit too much flavored with Middle East exoticism—like a teenager who thinks that the Hashashim were really really cool and that a version of them with a lot of power would be even cooler.  Like all the ninja stories, essentially.

Did I really write ‘the sandworms far oxygen’?  My proofreading has never been of the best.  Seems a little, um, cruel of you to point it out.

On the other hand, sayng “A medium worm (about 200 meters long) discharged into the atmosphere as much oxygen as ten square kilometers of green-growing photosynthesis surface.” is like saying “of course, a hippogriff can fly at _a hundred thousand miles an hour_‘.  On what grounds _might_ we disagree?  Except the grounds of general plausibility. (Ten square kilometers worth of vegetation? Surely not).

Don’t make me do the math, Adam, but I don’t find it quite so implausible.  “Green-growing photosynthesis surface” provides a sort of out since as you say it implies vegetation, and most oxygen in the atmosphere is actually from algae and bacteria photosynthesizing in the upper layer of the oceans.  And large organisms can have a large effect on the atmosphere—take cows and methane, say.

OF course the quote is overreaching in some ways.  It strives for a fictitious authority through numeric specification in round numbers—200 meters long, ten square kilometers.  And ten square kilometers of what?—do all planets and all plants have the same photosynthesis efficiency?  It’s not the kind of thing that an actual planetologist would write, you’d think.  But it is well-suited towards giving the relatively unsuspicious SF readers of the time an impression that all of this had been worked out.

As I’ve mentioned before, I don’t think that it’s really possible to write “hard SF” and not get things wrong in this way—look at the carping about _Gradisil_, or the way people liked to bring up Kim Stanley Robinson’s unworkable Mars-heating windmills.

OK then - Where do they get the energy from? Cracking CO2 into O2 takes energy. Plants get this from absorbing sunlight. Worms can’t do that because they live underground. So are they nuclear powered or something?

Also, if they are (something)synthetic, why do they go around eating Fremen (or anything at all)? Do they need the trace minerals or something?

They get energy from eating some kind of plant-animal hybrid that lives in the sand, if I remember rightly.  Like whales with plankton.  They eat Fremen because they are annoyed by noise and eat anything that makes it in order to stop it, which I suppose is plausible as a sort of territory-defense tactic against other worms.

I’m not really a Dune fanboy, but my decades-old memory of the books seems sufficient to answer those kind of objections.  But I really don’t think that you’re going to catch out Herbert that way.  Or really, you will catch him out eventually, but I don’t think it really says anything about his work that you can do so.  Science fiction fans like to think that SF is abut science speculation, and they’ve convinced some others about this, but it’s really not true.

I’ve been slogging my way through the series (I’m halfway through _Heretics of Dune_, and after _Chapterhouse_ I’m quitting) and I have no qualms about how such an improbable planet came to be. What seems inexplicable is how such a crappy novel came to be so popular. But I guess stranger things have happened (e.g., the Left Behind series--I think I deserve a Purple Heart for having survived _Glorious Appearing_. It had never occurred to me that the Second Coming would depend so much on one man’s ability to drive an ATV.)

To me whatever strength there is in _Dune_ resides in its clever mixing of 60s issues like oil monopoly/dependency, ecology, techno-anxiety, LSD-style consciousness expanding, and pop spirituality into the single trope of the spice. Beyond that, what is there? A _Lawrence of Arabia_ ripoff with bad description, pompous dialogue, and a Renaissance Faire sensibility.

” A Lawrence of Arabia ripoff with bad description, pompous dialogue, and a Renaissance Faire sensibility.”

And ninjas!  I mean, Assassin knock-offs.  Actually, I don’t think that anyone has mentioned the Bene Gesserit power-through-female-sexuality thing.  That, and its sexism, is very 60s too.

What was good about the book?  By that I mean the first book, since as far as I recall they got steadily worse as the series went on, and I never made it through _Heretics_.  A “clever mixing of 60s issues” sounds right.  Also its ripoff of Bedouin culture was unusual for SF at that time, since SF tended to assume that everyone in the universe was American or European.  And its use of sand ecology—all of those specialized terms for sand structures that you realized weren’t made-up SF terms, but real ones—also worked well.

But what I give the book the most credit for is, as Scott wrote, its critique of messianic thought.  It would have been very easy to write a Heinlein-style _Strangers in a Strange Land_.  But when we see the Dune messiah, everyone is hailing him as the messiah, and he’s going along with it, but even before he’s actually taken power he’s wrestling with the foreknowledge that the powerless, sinned-against people who are hailing him are going to become the next wave of oppressors.  And he goes along because he’ll probably get killed if he doesn’t, and rationalizes the necessity of him doing so, but really, he fails.  His universe gets locked into an unchanging religious despotism until people who’ve escaped past its limits return and kick the whole thing over.

That’s not really a great message, since it still builds up the Great Man theory of history—that there’s a single person whose choices can affect society in that way.  But, for SF, it’s better than the people who write messianism that succeeds.  It’s not the _Left Behind_ books.

The biggest howler in _Dune_ is the stillsuits.  Evaporative cooling is what prevents you from cooking in the desert; if you condense the sweat the heat comes right back.  They’d need an air conditioner.

Can we please have a discussion of obscure setting details in a third-rate novel that’s *not* science fiction?  I feel like we don’t have enough of these sorts of conversations around here.

I agree with Rich that _Dune_ deserves credit for its critique of fascist-messianism; but it deserves more credit than just that, I think: it was one of the first big ‘environmentalist’ books (H. dedicates it to ‘dry-land ecologists’), ahead of the curve on what was (in the mid-60s) a minority interest but one which went on to become ... er, kind of important.  It also gets credit in my book for the way it interrogates Asimov’s _Foundation_ stories, and specifically the way it critiques their extraordinarily rigid positivism whereby the future can be predicted down to the last detail millennia in advance (indeed: according to Asimov even the unpredictable things, like the mule, _can be predicted_).  Herbert’s instincts, viz. that this is not only wrong but ideologically malign, were surely right; and in various ways he attempts to suggest that both politics and ‘the future’ are, in the modern sense, chaotic systems, which was pretty smart for its time.

Perhaps the environmentalist aspect of the book is harder to see now.  I remember reading it as a 12-13 year old and wondering what the “Great Erg” was supposed to be, then realizing that there really were ergs on our actual planet; in fact, there were whole batches of landforms that never appeared near where I lived.  That’s as example of one of the best things that SF can do—not just defamiliarization, or ostranenie, in the sense of making me realize that the local landforms were local and contingent and that it was really kind of odd that they’d turned out as they had and not some other way, but opening out into the consideration of new imaginary places that turn out to be real, reachable places.  If was the same sort of feeling as with, say, _Neuromancer_, which made me realize that there not only was something decidedly odd about familiar technology as it got more wearable, but that subcultures based on it already existed.

Luther, you go to literary discussions with the fans that you have, not the fans that you wish you had.  A large group of people is interested in SF, and willing to go on at length about it, so…  but, actually, we did go on at length about details of _Adam Bede_.  Which wasn’t a third-rate novel, but I don’t really think that _Dune_ is either.  I’d go for second.

I can go for second as well--for _Dune_ at least, but not the rest. Part of the problem with seeing these novels as “environmental” is that they span thousands and thousands of years and thus provide a great opportunity to explore long-term planetary changes, and make those changes in some way integral to the various plots and themes. But that never really happens. Herbert never exploits this opportunity in any meaningful way. Once the Ixians figure out how to synthesize spice the Arrakis ecology pretty much ceases to matter.

One thing I did like is the cynical portrayal of religion, especially the Bene Gesserit’s “planting” of religions among cultures with the aim of exploiting people’s beliefs in the future. Instead of simply exploiting religious beliefs as found, why not create beliefs for that very purpose?

I think I’d agree that Herbert doesn’t do environmentalism very well; but the thing is he _did do_ it.  What are the other major works of art from the 60s and 70s that say ‘the environment is a big deal’?

Well, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Plus, in its own weird way, Trout Fishing in America. I suppose nonfiction doesn’t count, else the obvious choice would be Silent Spring, with honorable mentions going to any of a number of works by other nature writers. And of course Gary Snyder is publishing his poems and mini-manifestos throughout the decade.

Maybe Dune is best characterized as part of an eco-literary 60s _vanguard_, among the first to explore in s-f what many other notable writers are exploring in other genres. But to the extent that the classic dystopias are s-f, then the roots of its concern with ecology go back at least to _We_, no? The classic dystopias typically contrast the ruined or wholly artificial environment of the failed utopia with a green world, somewhere outside, of naturalness and freedom. I guess this is more pastoral symbolism than real environmentalism, but it might have made it easier for s-f to go green in the 60s.
