Like it or not, we have become a community.  We may not like each other very much, but truth be told, we allocate time better spent sleeping to undermining the very foundation of each other’s respective worldviews.  Thing is, we do so in a way that may perplex outsiders.  So I suggest we create an FAQ which new readers can consult when, for example, one of us indicts the other for "having a [plane](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/hix_dixerit_quispiam_or_you_must_try_again_until_you_get_it_right_part_mcxv/#5920) to [catch](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/montrum_in_fronte_monstrum_in_animo/#8370)" or "[making](http://pasaudela.blogspot.com/2005/08/tips-from-wb.html) some [pasta](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/on_jager_or_dri.html)."  Starter entries include:

**Aeroplanes, the Boarding of** **_v._** An [insidious](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/hix_dixerit_quispiam_or_you_must_try_again_until_you_get_it_right_part_mcxv/#5920) tactic designed to allow the boardee more time to respond cleverly to entries posted in distant time zones.

**Holbo, John _n._** An analytic blowhard who [puffs fish](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2005/01/clueless_in_aca_1.html) and [butchers anyone who complains](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thevalve.org%2Fgo%2Fvalve%2Farticle%2F334&ei=S_ZKRLwloaxhvKGc7Qc&sig2=pSpGeoqZILQ5IS22cRsO_A).

**Kaufman, Scott the Eric of** **_n._** Confused, narcissistic graduate student who sympathizes with all folks regardless of scholarly orientation, discovers strangers in his office, thinks too much about things evolutionary and feels really, really old.

**Kotsko, Adam _n._** Outrageously funny seminarian who loves Christ (conflictedly), refuses [to smack](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2005/11/analysis-of-smacking.html), and defends Slovenian Lacanians from analytic blowhards.

**Pasta, the Boiling of** **_v._** A rhetorical strategy designed to fool one’s opponent into believing that common human courtesy overrides online commitments to continued debate. 

**Spivak _v._** The practice of failing to contribute to an event because of personal or professional obligations.  For example, "Kaufman, Scott the Eric of _totally_ spivaked the Spivak event!"

**Žižek, Slavoj _n._** Slovenian Lacanian whose hilarious and eminently engaging works are nonetheless savaged by those who hate to love the unpretentious sense of humor they share with him.  (_See **Holbo, John**_)

Methinks this the beginning of a collaborative FAQ.  Consider this a draft of a document whose potential to be gratifyingly self-deprecatory is infinite.  John and I encourage everyone to write their own entry, suggest changes to those sketched above, and offer other categories which belong on it.

Smith, Anthony Paul _n._ Not fucking amused, vulgar.

**blah** _n_.  Anonymous; only comments when he disagrees with something.  

**Higher Eclectism** _n_.  John will post a 10,000 word essay clarifying this concept, maybe next week.

**Kotsko, Adam, _n._** A theology student most famous for his declarations that he is going to be cutting back on blogging in the near future.  His weakness for blogfights accounts for his continued failure to make something of himself.

Chris Hellstrom, n Long time lurker. Known to wait for the safe post, to grind axe slightly and escape without harsh scrutiny. Failed novelist. Cheerfully enthusiastic but mediocre academic wannabee. Slighlty right wing happy nihilist and doting dad.

**nnyhav, _v.i._** touristing without borders

**Holbonic _adj._** Bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some. Much bigger than that in fact, really amazingly immense, a totally stunning size, “wow, that’s big”, time. Infinity is just so big that by comparison, bigness itself looks really titchy. Gigantic multiplied by colossal multiplied by staggeringly huge is the sort of concept we’re trying to get across here.

**Davis, Ray _n. Obs._** A flagellant Aesthetic sect of the late Capitalist era whose inviability was assured by strict vows of chastity.
