[Some people](http://waxbanks.typepad.com/), as well as [some others](http://theworldsforgottenboy.blogspot.com/), write prose which shames me.  Not into silence, mind you, but into considering it.  Any [_Wake_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141181265/diesekoschmar-20) partisans—as well as all you [Roland McHugh](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0801841909/diesekoschmar-20) groupies—will appreciate Waxbank's [exagmination round his factification for incamination](http://waxbanks.typepad.com/blog/2006/06/the_working_wak.html) of Joyce's "Work in Progress."  That post will also interest those who—like this hobbled fool—have recently read Russell Hoban's impressive [_Riddley Walker_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0253212340/diesekoschmar-20).  Outside of M. John Harrison's [_The Course of the Heart_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1892389975/diesekoschmar-20), I can't think of another book which has stuck to my (limited) critical faculties like smooth [_arachis hypogaea_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut) paste.

Quote: ...exagmination round his factification for incamination...

Is it contagious, and is there a cure?

An acolyte's sneer.

That's Joycean hubris, it is: click [here](http://netsoc.dit.ie/~jamesf/samuel_beckett/samuel_beckett_work_in_progress.html) for an explanation of that phrase.  It's always struck me as musically deflating academic pretention, but I understand if not everyone sees it that way.

Jonathan,

One of these days your face is going to freeze that way.

Scott,

I have to wonder if it's Joyce, or academia's reaction to Joyce. I'm inclined to think it's academia's clueless acceptance of Joycean word play as serious expression. With that in mind I present this variant on an old joke.

What is the difference between a scientist, an academic, and a NASCAR fan?

It's in how they react to a joke.

The NASCAR fan will laugh once, when you tell it, because he gets it.

The academic will laugh twice. Once when you tell it, to be polite; the second when you explain it, to be polite. He will never get it.

A scientist will laugh three times. Once when you tell it, to be polite; the second when you explain it, to be polite; and the third time, in the middle of the night, when he gets it.
