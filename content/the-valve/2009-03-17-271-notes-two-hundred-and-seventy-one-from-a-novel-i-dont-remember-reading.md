271 notes (two hundred and seventy-one) from a novel I don't remember reading.\*

Before I could return _[The Damnation of Theron Ware](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1605896969/diesekoschmar-20)_ to [my beloved](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/cashier.html) [library](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/unbelievable-up.html), I had to remove all the notes I'd stuck to its pages. It took me a while:

[![Note_wheel](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168ff420c970c-320wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168ff420c970c-pi)

The resulting note wheel is as lovely as it is meaningless, because I remember absolutely nothing about _The Damnation of Theron Ware._ From my notes, I can _almost_ reconstruct why I read it:

Theron enjoys the "primitive" pleasures of Catholic picnics; contrast to earlier (235-6) image of it as orderly machine; no, from sociological & intellectual perspective it's orderly, from internal is 
primitive

If only I knew the antecedent of "it" I might be able to reconstruct my reason for reading the book. Am I the only one for whom [the Five Year Rule](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/a_very_unfunny_.html) applies? (And do I _really_ want that question answered?)

\*Notation borrowed from a letter Joyce wrote to his mother after arriving in Paris: "Your order for 3s 4d of Tuesday last was very welcome as I had been without food for 42 hours (forty-two)." How's that for passive-aggression?

I tried using multi-colored tabs when I started the dissertation, but found them too constricting.  What I mean is, I found that by pre-categorizing certain textual moments as relating to X or Y or Z, I couldn't avoid being tendentious.  (This is a personal failing, though.)  So what I did was switch to all the same color, then when I re-noted them—_i.e._ when I compiled my notes into a document—I was better able to let the text speak for itself and complicate my otherwise uninventive insights.  (That said, I obviously never went through that stage with _Theron Ware_, otherwise it would've been de-tabbed.)

My favorite bit from that novel goes, "I divide people up into two classes, you know--Greeks and Jews.  Once you get hold of that principle, all other divisions and classifications, such as by race or language or nationality, seem pure foolishness.  It is the only true division there is.  It is just as true among negroes or wild Indians who never heard of Athens or Jerusalem, as it is among white folks.  That is the beauty of it.  It works everywhere, always."

How about THAT notion?  Sheesh!
