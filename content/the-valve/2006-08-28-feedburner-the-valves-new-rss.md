## Feedburner, The Valve's New RSS

Since I've started reading blogs via RSS, I've noticed something about ours:

It's unformatted, doesn't indicate whether there's anything below the fold (or even that the fold exists), and doesn't let you jump straight into the comments.  To rectify some of these issues, we've created a Feedburner feed, which you can subscribe to by adding [this link](http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheValve) to your RSS reader.

That will fix the formatting.  We should have the others issues cleared up by week's end.

Hey, this RSS feed has recently (over the weekend, I think) gone to just the titles of articles. Any way to set it back to full articles?

Dan, we're aware of the problems with the RSS feeds and our administrator is currently working on them.    (We've been [fiddling with RSS feeds everywhere](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/10/im_sorry_but_pl.html) this weekend, but it'll all be straightened out soon enough.)  We apologize for the inconvenience.
