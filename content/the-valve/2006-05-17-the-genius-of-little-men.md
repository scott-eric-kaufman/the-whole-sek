From Maurice Thompson, “The Domain of Romance,” _Forum_, November 1889:

The genius of little men expressed itself, as it is still doing, through analytical fiction—a mistaken impulse arising out of a failure to understand the signs of the times.  Darwin, and not the novelists, was to be the safety valve of the epoch.

Apropos, no?  

Not at all, actually.  But it _seems_ meaningful in this context.  (For more on what the article actually argued, [click here](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/the_genius_of_l.html).)
