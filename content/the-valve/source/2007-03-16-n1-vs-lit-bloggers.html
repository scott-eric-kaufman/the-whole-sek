<h3>n+1 vs. Lit-Bloggers; or, on with the Resipiscence, already</h3>
<p class="author">Posted by <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/member/79/">Scott Eric Kaufman</a> on 03/16/07 at 08:29 PM</p>

<p>The lit-blogging community is positively apoplectic about the latest <a href="http://www.nplusonemag.com/"><i>n+1</i></a>.&nbsp; In &#8220;The Intellectual Situation,&#8221; <a href="http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2007/02/the_intemperate.html#comments">you&#8217;ll recall</a>, the editors write:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The blogs salved this ennui and created nourishing microcommunities. Yet criticism as an art didn&#8217;t survive. People <em>might</em> have used their blogs to post the best they could think or say. They <em>could</em> have posted 5,000 word critiques of their favorite books and records. Some polymath might even have shown, online, how an acute and well-stocked sensibility responds to the streaming world in real time. But those things didn&#8217;t happen, at least not often enough. In practice, blogs reveal how much we are unwitting stenographers of hip talk and marketing speak, and how secondhand and often ugly our unconscious impulses still are. The need for speed encourages, as a willed style, the intemperate, the unconsidered, the undigested .... The language is supposed to mimic the way people speak on the street or the college quad, the phatic emotive growl and purr of exhibitionistic consumer satifsfaction—"The Divine Comedy is SOOO GOOOD!"—or displeasure—"I shit on Dante!&#8221; So man hands information on to man.</p></blockquote>
<p>
The pace of the contemporary moment is ruinous.&nbsp; Who has time to develop an opinion anymore?&nbsp; We must choose between the obvious and <em>la critique trouvé</em>.&nbsp; The former wins little readership; the latter, a devoted following.&nbsp; Canny appreciation will win a blogger an audience—earn him entrance into the nourishing microcommunity of his choosing—but the quality of his thought will suffer.&nbsp; He will repeat himself repeating others and be praised for it.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s not like the editors of <em>n+1</em> won&#8217;t begrudge such coteries the solace of companionship.&nbsp; As Keith Gessen writes in <a href="http://marksarvas.blogs.com/elegvar/2007/03/the_n1_letters__1.html">an email Mark Sarvas posted</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s just a different model of magazine. As you say, Eliot&#8217;s <em>Criterion</em>, where he published <em>The Waste Land</em>, or something like <em>Partisan Review</em> (those guys published their own poetry!), are places where the editors had things they wanted to say that they believed no one else was saying. Irving Howe&#8217;s <em>Dissent</em>. Herzen&#8217;s <em>Bell</em>. Dwight Macdonald&#8217;s <em>Politics</em>. Sartre&#8217;s <em>Les Temps Modernes</em>. The other model is curatorial: you&#8217;re throwing a creative writing contest and whoever wins the contest gets published. That&#8217;s the <em>New American Review</em> or the <em>Paris Review</em>—or the thousand magazines associated with MFA programs. They&#8217;re both valid models, but obviously we&#8217;re working in the first one.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Most of those—especially those publishing the work of the New York Intellectuals—are coterie work.&nbsp; When judging it, you take into account the intellectual environment that produced it.&nbsp; You look for the shared ideological, intellectual and personal assumptions of the group of people writing for a particular venue and you adjust your assessment accordingly.&nbsp; To rail against <em>n+1</em> for treating a self-sustaining intellectual community as a single entity is a general complaint, one easily recognizable to you folk if I substitute &#8220;theorists&#8221; for &#8220;lit-bloggers.&#8221;  You can, <a href="http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2007/02/are_we_who_you_.html">like Jodi</a>, consider any such effort inherently dismissive, but much of what I&#8217;ve learned earning my Book of the Month Club degree says otherwise.&nbsp; The issue is <em>always</em> thornily general; complaints about the inaccuracy of the generalization <em>always</em> miss the point ... <em>especially</em> when they validate the generalization in the same breath they deny its explanatory power.
</p>
<p>
Take Sarvas.&nbsp; He should be shamed for publishing private correspondence, but he should be mocked for publishing it because Gessen, Marco Roth <em>et al</em> had to gall to point out that &#8220;lit-bloggers [have] become a self-sustaining community, minutemen ready to rise up in defense of their niches.&#8221;  The pettiness behind his decision to publish Gessen&#8217;s emails proves the editors of <em>n+1</em> correct: some lit-bloggers do turn bellicose when their authority&#8217;s questioned.&nbsp; Garth Risk Hallberg&#8217;s considered rebuttals on <a href="http://www.themillionsblog.com/">The Millions</a> work to refute the generalization, but the <a href="http://www.themillionsblog.com/2007/03/keepers-of-flame-reply-to-n1.html#comments">comments and links to his post</a> contains more of the same:
</p>
<blockquote><p>You think I&#8217;m small-minded?&nbsp; I&#8217;ll show you.&nbsp; <em>I&#8217;ll publish your private correspondence.</em>  
</p>
<p>
Teach you to call me petty.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Or consider Edward Champion&#8217;s <a href="http://www.edrants.com/?p=5653">biting response</a> to the claim that lit-bloggers &#8220;represent a perfection of the outsourcing ethos of capitalism&#8221;:
</p>
<blockquote><p>[insert author name]’s [latest book from author] has hit bookstores. It’s criminally underated, and [reviewer who writes somewhat intelligently or has interesting take] has an interesting take on why it’s worth your time.
</p>
<p>
Last night, I had a [vaguely personal moment in which I don’t reveal too much of myself to readers, because, based on some of the comments here, I think a few of you are keeping extremely close track of my personal life—for what reason I have no idea]. And it reminded me of [article which probably has nothing to do with moment in question].
</p>
<p>
And I would be remiss if I didn’t mention [A friend or acquaintance who has done something interesting, must keep this near the end to avoid favoritism]’s thoughtful project, which should blow the lid on [incongruous reference here because I’m overworked and I need more coffee so that I can stay awake, until such moment as I will be able to properly collapse].</p></blockquote>
<p>
As withering self-deprecation goes, Champion&#8217;s performance is brilliant; unfortunately, it also proves the very point he wanted to refute.&nbsp; In real sense, Champion and other lit-bloggers <em>are</em> vehicles for information about literature, not organs (<em>ahem</em>, <em>ahem</em>) devoted to its study.&nbsp; Which is <em>fine</em>.&nbsp; I read Champion <em>because</em> he has his ear to the ground.&nbsp; He does a phenomenonal job tracking trends in contemporary literature.&nbsp; (I find his book reviews a little too mainstream for my taste, but their failings are exemplary of the form, not the individual.)  Perhaps unfairly, <em>n+1</em> castigated the lit-bloggers for not being something they aren&#8217;t trying to be; but the editors do have a point about the lack of speculative gusto, or more mundanely, the poor reading skills of many in the lit-blogging community.
</p>
<p>
You see, my biggest complaint about the lit-blogger&#8217;s response <em>n+1</em> is that it simply <em>misses the point</em>.&nbsp; The entire &#8220;Intellectual Situation&#8221; is a meditation on the relation of speed and technology to the cultivation of thought:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The true mood of the form is spontaneity, alacrity—the right time to reply to a message is right away. But do that and your life is gone.</p></blockquote>
<p>
As with email, so too with cellphones and blogs.&nbsp; The dearth of analytic vim in <em>any</em> blogging community is not necessarily the fault of the individuals comprising it, but a symptom of the temptations of the genre.&nbsp; It <em>is</em> tempting to write book-chat.&nbsp; It <em>is</em> tempting to turn a blog into group therapy.&nbsp; It <em>is</em> tempting to post the same sort of fluff found in <em>Slate</em>.&nbsp; It <em>is</em> tempting to link to the same YouTube video everyone else has.&nbsp; Unless you consciously fight it, the inertia of generic norms will exert its influence on you ... and your blog&#8217;ll be the worse for it.&nbsp; That lit-blogs are singled out speaks to their potential—to the potential of people who are still devoted readers—to bring to their blogging the same spirit of resistance they demonstrate every time they choose to read instead of write an email, use their cellphone, or turn on their Wii.
</p>
<p>
Now if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;m off to <a href="http://www.areadvd.de/lm/Multimedia/Images/gc/gcnintendowiiScreenshot%20Wii%20Tennis%20mit%20Spielern.jpg">play tennis</a>.

<a name="14884"></a><p>I think that I was tired of this particular &#8220;controversy&#8221; before it even began.&nbsp; So I&#8217;ll just refer back to some Valve discussion that occured before it even began: between <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/backlashes_and_blogs_and_babyshambles/#12896">here</a>, <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/backlashes_and_blogs_and_babyshambles/#12958">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/backlashes_and_blogs_and_babyshambles/#12975">here</a>.&nbsp; My basic point: if you&#8217;re taking the stance that you are focussed on &#8220;the current situation&#8221;, you have to temper this ambition with awareness of the limits of your knowledge.&nbsp;  It&#8217;s not an article that can be fixed up by saying something trite like &#8220;Hey, there are good lit-blogs out there, but they aren&#8217;t very visible; we weren&#8217;t writing about them&#8221;.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a matter of not recognizing what the current situation is.&nbsp; The Valve, Long Sunday, and all of the individual blogs by various similar writers aren&#8217;t as invisible within lit-blogging as the article would suggest.
</p>
<p>
Keith Gessen writes in one of the linked comment threads: &#8220;As long as these people are the ones making noise, when some mainstream media person puts together a list of &#8220;leading lit-blogs,&#8221; they&#8217;ll be on it. And when a print publication like n+1 decides to write something about blogs, those will be the people on our minds, because they&#8217;re the ones shoving their half-formed sentences in our faces. You--the better bloggers--have no right to complain about this, because you&#8217;re not coming forward to say: No, those guys aren&#8217;t the real bloggers. And you&#8217;re not telling them to shut up. Until you do that, they will represent you to the world. It&#8217;s up to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Well, no.&nbsp; People have far better things to do than to operate an impossible discipline &amp; punish Internet police action on behalf of litblogging.&nbsp; I counter-suggest that maybe it&#8217;s a critic&#8217;s responsiblity to find what&#8217;s good.&nbsp; Dismissing what&#8217;s bad is amusing also, of course, but not if it turns into something too much like rejecting academia because it contains Ward Churchill, and then telling academics that they should have told him to shut up.
</p>
<p>
Of course, you need a certain degree of ambitiousness to attempt something like n+1 in the first place.&nbsp; The whole thing doesn&#8217;t deserve the flame war that&#8217;s inevitably going to happen.

I&#8217;m annoyed by the whole matter, but am just emerging from a week-and-a-half-long fog, so this post was as much as I could muster.
</p>
<p>
The thing is, I actually agree with the <em>n+1</em> assessment, in that I use my RSS feeds of so-called &#8220;lit-blogs&#8221;&#8212;I hate the word with the hyphen, but even more without&#8212;and wish that more of them could be, if not academic, then at least more like Kugelmass.&nbsp; By which I mean, more literary, less chatty.&nbsp; I know this criticism is unjust&#8212;you can&#8217;t ask other people to tailor their hobbies to your needs&#8212;but there&#8217;s a rhetoric of representation here that bothers me.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
What I mean is&#8212;yes, I <em>am</em> saying that a lot, but I blame the foggy-headedness&#8212;that it&#8217;s odd that the Valve and Long Sunday are suddenly included in all the lists of lit-blogs, despite that never having been the case before.&nbsp; We&#8217;re being held as exemplars of that which we are not, but which others are chided for not being.&nbsp; That irks me.&nbsp; (Then again, so does everything else right now.)

</p>
<p>
As for wanting more blogs to be like Kugelmass, how many blogs can one read?&nbsp; Joseph posted an essay above that&#8217;s going to take my available reading time for the next who-knows-how-long; if many more people decided to post more like him then I wouldn&#8217;t have time to read them anyway.&nbsp; Why not just let chattiness exist for those who want it?
</p>
<p>
Fully agree on the picture mockery, of course.

I whined about this when a similar excerpt was published at Long Sunday*, but &lt;q&gt;The need for speed encourages, as a willed style, the intemperate, the unconsidered, the undigested&lt;/q&gt; … ok, that&#8217;s one willed style, and one can object to it because it wears its willedness on its sleeve (as someone else in the same LS thread pointed out, what style isn&#8217;t willed?—well, I decline to speculate; probably some aren&#8217;t).&nbsp; But no less does the Intellectual Situation bit wear its on its, and <em>that</em> style, supercilious, facile, sort of erudite, and yet completely obvious, is, to me, much more offensive than whatever it is they&#8217;re decrying.&nbsp; Or so at any rate I suspect; if I&#8217;ve ever read anything online that mimicked the way people spoke on &#8220;the college quad&#8221; of <em>my</em> college, it was quoted from <em>n+1</em>.

Now that Scott&#8217;s taken me on a nasty little tour of the lit-blogs the n+1 guys were talking about, I entirely agree with their assessment. Whoa-hey. Those aren&#8217;t pretty.

</p>
<p>
Problem was, when I wrote the response Scott links to above, I thought that <i>we were the litblogs</i>, meaning LS and well sure I guess the Valve. I mean, I&#8217;ve read Bookslut. She was once, along time ago, on my rss rolodex. But these blogs here, no.... 
</p>
<p>
And the whole &#8220;caught Gessen out because he sent us a copy&#8221; stuff. What, are they priming for the next Oprah / faux memoir affair? Just stupid.

I suppose the difference, for me, is between raw enthusiasm and aged opinion.&nbsp; There was a time I&#8217;d talk about nothing but <em>Lot 49</em> to everyone who crossed my path&#8212;can I emphasize how little that did for my dating life&#8212;but I understand the utility of such enthusiasm.&nbsp; It <em>can</em> lead to greater appreciation, and is the first step to it.&nbsp; If lit-blogs are a virtual community replicating the haphazard one I (luckily) stumbled into, the more power to them.&nbsp; Enthusiasm comes first, no?&nbsp; (And I realize I&#8217;m so tired and ill I&#8217;m now playing my own Devil&#8217;s Advocate, but whatever.&nbsp; This is merely a blog, after all.)
</p>
<p>
Rich, we may be a lit-blog inasmuch as we talk about literature, but neither us nor the Long Sunday bunch belong to the community of self-identifying lit-bloggers.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not listed in that <a href="http://metaxucafe.com/">MetaxuCafé</a> thing I can&#8217;t navigate, nor are we on the blogrolls o&#8217; all them other lit-blogs ... which isn&#8217;t a judgment, only a way to say that <em>n+1</em> is correct about the nature of the lit-blogging community.&nbsp; (I mean, one of them, <a href="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/msg.jsp?what=BlogReflex"><em>Literary Kicks</em></a>, played host to the Troll of Sorrow&#8217;s <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/anatomy_of_a_tr.html">endless self-aggrandizement</a>.&nbsp; I mean, they <em>still</em> ain&#8217;t recognized him for the fraud he is.&nbsp; Not that this is representative of the lit-bloggers, mind you, only that it indicates, um, something or other.&nbsp; I should say now, and definitively, that I actively like and think fondly of Edward Champion and <a href="http://www.conversationalreading.com/">Scott Esposito</a>.&nbsp; I mean, neither of them is quite up to <a href="http://noggs.typepad.com/the_reading_experience/">Daniel Green</a>&#8216;s level, but I value both of them for their occasional thoughtfulness ... but I wish they&#8217;d be more like Daniel.&nbsp; I mean, even when I disagree with him, I get the sense of a mind behind the prose, but outside of Champion, Esposito and a few others, I don&#8217;t get that.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a whiff of obligatory fanboyism counteracting all the good enthusiastic vibes.

After thinking about it, and reading these threads, I don&#8217;t think that this example holds up.&nbsp; A &#8220;theorist&#8221; is someone who &#8220;does theory&#8221;, and there&#8217;s pretty good agreement about what that means as a specialized term of art.&nbsp; That agreement isn&#8217;t invalidated by theorists disagreeing with each other, or having internally differing traditions, or any of the other objections brought up.&nbsp; But &#8220;lit-bloggers&#8221; is evidently not being used in that sense.&nbsp; Scott, you seem to be using lit-bloggers to mean &#8220;the community of self-identifying lit-bloggers&#8221; that links to Metaxucafe and so on, so that it&#8217;s no longer defined by the activity of blogging about literature.
</p>
<p>
So this turns into a big argument about who is a lit-blogger and who is meant, with some saying they were ignored, some misrepresented, some saying that the n+1 article is OK because they weren&#8217;t meant, some like marydell above not wanting to be represented as part of the criticized group.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s really a problem with the original article.&nbsp; If they hadn&#8217;t meant all lit-blogging, they should have said so, or mentioned specific examples of which blogs they were talking about.&nbsp; It&#8217;s easy to see why they didn&#8217;t, though.&nbsp; Then it doesn&#8217;t become a piece about &#8220;the current situation&#8221;.&nbsp; Writing about &#8220;the current situation&#8221; almost always requires this kind of emphatic overgeneralization.
</p>
<p>
At the top of this thread, I wrote that n+1 didn&#8217;t deserve to be flamed.&nbsp; I similarly think that Ed Champion and so on are being judged too harshly by CR and others.&nbsp; No one is going to look good if your first view of them is mid-flame-war.&nbsp; (And no, I don&#8217;t buy &#8220;but there are so many layers!&#8221; about the picture, but that isn&#8217;t a reason to reject an entire blog&#8217;s worth of output.&nbsp; CR, don&#8217;t be too confident that we&#8217;ve always done better.)  I particularly agree that wanting people to come up to someone else&#8217;s level is not good; everyone writes at whatever level they write at, and no one has to read them.
</p>
<p>
But the thread ends as the thread starts.&nbsp; By writing the article as they did, n+1 made it so that no discussion that anyone can learn anything from really can follow.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the basic problem.

Yes, exactly.&nbsp; How clever of you to know that I hoped someone would chance on a reading of precisely that implausibility and uncharitability!&nbsp; What <em>else</em>, after all, could one mean in saying that there are probably some un-willed styles?

<p>
I completely agree. I don&#8217;t understand what Gessen and Roth thought they were accomplishing by fanning this flame war in the first place. They published a piece slamming litbloggers, but rather than name names in the piece itself they waited until the predictable response from litbloggers who thought they *might* be among those who don&#8217;t measure up to G &amp; R&#8217;s standards to leap in and start sliming individual bloggers. The slur against Scott Esposito was especially vile. As far as I can tell, Scott has done nothing to offend the n+1ers, and has even talked up the magazine on his blog. He&#8217;s gone on record as opposing Mark S&#8217;s tactic of publishing Gessen&#8217;s e-mails.
</p>
<p>
Bottom-line questions: Do Gessen and Roth want readers for their journal or not? If they do, why don&#8217;t they 1) make more of their content available online so that those of us who don&#8217;t know if we want to subscribe (and I have to say I&#8217;m now *much* less likely to subscribe) can decide if we like the thing or not, and 2) stop acting as if the &#8220;contest&#8221; between print mags and blogs is a zero-sum game. 
</p>
<p>
The very people who are likely to read n + 1, even to do a little of the very publicizing G &amp; R so revile on *its*, behalf, are the bloggers and their own readers. Yet Gessen and Roth seem to do everything they can do express their disdain for these litbloggers. Am I the only one who thinks that as a marketing strategy, this is insane?
</p>
<p>
And I surely do appreciate Scott K&#8217;s kind words about me.

Um, I don&#8217;t know, Ben.&nbsp; Aside from &#8220;coming by it naturally&#8221; as I suggested in the thread you cite as having abandoned.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s why I asked, because I (still) don&#8217;t know, what you think.&nbsp; Which makes for difficulty in placing your rather bold and sweeping criticism.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<em>and it’s the bludgeoning I took at the hands of the style to which I objected.&nbsp; As I said.&nbsp; Quite plainly. </em>
</p>
<p>
Quite.&nbsp; Also, you were reacting to the one paragraph from the Intellectual Situation excerpted by CR. 
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m not talking about style vs. content at all.&nbsp; Those of the Intellectual Situation are significantly removed from those of the essays (many of which are written by people other than the editors).

</p>
<p>
<em>You see, my biggest complaint about the lit-blogger’s response to n+1 is that it simply misses the point.&nbsp; The entire “Intellectual Situation” [not to mention the issue itself] is a meditation on the relation of speed and technology to the cultivation of thought:
</p>
<p>
    &#8220;The true mood of the form is spontaneity, alacrity—the right time to reply to a message is right away. But do that and your life is gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
As with email, so too with cellphones and blogs.&nbsp; The dearth of analytic vim in any blogging community is not necessarily the fault of the individuals comprising it, but a symptom of the temptations of the genre.&nbsp; It is tempting to write book-chat.&nbsp; It is tempting to turn a blog into group therapy.&nbsp; It is tempting to post the same sort of fluff found in Slate.&nbsp; It is tempting to link to the same YouTube video everyone else has.&nbsp; Unless you consciously fight it, the inertia of generic norms will exert its influence on you ... and your blog’ll be the worse for it.&nbsp; That lit-blogs are singled out speaks to their potential—to the potential of people who are still devoted readers—to bring to their blogging the same spirit of resistance they demonstrate every time they choose to read instead of write an email, use their cellphone, or turn on their Wii. </em>
</p>
<p>
Thanks Scott.

<br />
the sentence goes, &#8220;The need for speed encourages, as a willed style, the intemperate, the unconsidered, the undigested.&#8221; In other words, people who know better, or ought to, affect to talk or write like drunk frat boys ranking girls or watching sports. The whole paragraph suggests that this is a faux-populism which can and ought to be resisted by those of us who still have hope for &#8220;the real language of men&#8221; [and women]. I&#8217;d say Scott&#8217;s post gets this right, if authors are allowed to judge how close readers come to their intentions. Of course, recent events might lead me to reconsider how &#8220;willed&#8221; this style is for some of us. Maybe we all actively prevent ourselves from writing badly or bad things (harder to say things true and not unkind), but I don&#8217;t believe it. Anyway, I agree that &#8220;style&#8221; by itself may have been sufficient to make the point, but that&#8217;s just copyediting.

The undertone of your comment seems to me to be that the n+1 folks shouldn&#8217;t be rude to Esposito, because he has been nice to them in the past, and that if they want to publicize their journal, they should be making nice to litbloggers, engaging in mutual backslapping, logrolling and all those things that make for a cosy and comfortable little circle of friends where everyone coos about how wonderful everyone else is. Which is surely what they are objecting to, trying to remove themselves from and so on, nicht wahr??
</p>
<p>
There&#8217;s a nice bit in Randall Jarrell&#8217;s collected letters - someone had gotten upset because he had been rude when reviewing a mediocre poet.

<p>
Cordelia&#8217;s motto makes for a comfier atmosphere, but for rather worse criticism surely. Not that I have any views on the <em>particular</em> merits of the complaints they make about specific litblogs blogs - since I became bored with Jessa Crispin a couple of years ago, I haven&#8217;t read litblogs (unless Maud Newton counts). But the suggestion that the n+1 folks should realise <em>just aren&#8217;t clubbable</em> and should mend their ways seems to miss the mark by a rather excessive amount.

This is Gessen&#8217;s comment. He offers no illustraton of the &#8220;phenomenal ignorance&#8221; of Scott Esposito&#8217;s blog, either here or in the orginal &#8220;Blog Reflex&#8221; thingamajig.

</p>
<p>
I mean, let&#8217;s start with the self-evident fact that criticism as an art *did* survive and that the Holbonic 5,000 word critique is so often seen that it has obtained its own adjective.&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; Scott valiently tries to save the piece by saying that it&#8217;s really about the temptations of the genre.&nbsp; Well, Scott&#8217;s piece is much better than the original, so let&#8217;s see.&nbsp; It&#8217;s true that Crooked Timber, to take one specific example, has fallen for these temptations to a large extent.&nbsp; (The time when three different posters all linked to the same beer commercial was about when I stopped reading it.)  But the Valve and LS haven&#8217;t, and they are more properly literary blogs.
</p>
<p>
The only real way to address this intelligently is through specificity.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s take Scott&#8217;s own blog, for instance.&nbsp; It occasionally threatens to veer into book chat, therapy, or links to  videos.&nbsp; Is that bad, though?&nbsp; On the contrary, I&#8217;d say that this is part of Scott&#8217;s creation of a narrator who can sustain reader interest.&nbsp; Even the most academic of literary bloggers tend to have some sort of contructed personal narrativity that surrounds their pieces on literary theory or criticism.&nbsp; What would &#8220;Dan Green&#8221; be without the brooding outsider critic persona, &#8220;John Emerson&#8221; without his punk sensibility (which he steadfastly refuses to recognize as a punk sensibility or as being a positive characterization, so I should choose something else), or &#8220;Miriam Burstein&#8221; without her Little-Professorhood and fascination with bookshelves?
</p>
<p>
The temptation to be taken over by book-chat then becomes a sort of failure of narrativity, a lapse into cliche.&nbsp;  Rather than being a symptom of intemperance / unconsideration / undigestion, it&#8217;s a matter of *tiredness*&#8212;the role played too long lapses into gesture.&nbsp; That&#8217;s about the best I can do at rehabilitating the thread.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t see how it really has much to do with the original n+1 statement, which directs its guns towards an empty field.

</p>
<p>
First, Scott, thank you for that very generous and thoughtful post. 
</p>
<p>
David Schneider: Good luck with the Boy Bedlam Review. That&#8217;s a good idea. I couldn&#8217;t tell whether your last sentence meant you intended to be a response or an antidote to our anti-blogging article. I hope it&#8217;s the former. Surely we&#8217;re not such a poison that you would need the latter.
</p>
<p>
Daniel: What you say is untrue. You quote the first sentence of the paragraph; the rest of the paragraph is devoted to two examples: the anti-Wasserman and anti-Tanenhaus campaigns, both of which are anti&#8230; historical, and the latter of which &#8220;Conversational Reading&#8221; has been party to. (Though certainly not at Ed levels.) I don&#8217;t actually think Conversational Reading is in the same category as TEV and Ed, for a number of reasons, and I included it on the list with some reluctance. 
</p>
<p>
Actually, Scott&#8217;s response to the whole thing has been illustrative. He quickly posted two dismissive responses--one saying he couldn&#8217;t take us seriously, the other saying that we were trying to &#8220;marginalize&#8221; blogs with one hand and reach out to them (via email) with the other. (As the TEV emails reveal, I think, it has never been my intention, as the person in charge of n+1 publicity, to marginalize blogs: I think they&#8217;re important and I want them to do a better job. But that&#8217;s not marginalization.) Then he put up a post saying he disapproved of the email-publishing on TEV (exactly the sort of policing Rich disdains, but which any community needs), and ended it all with a reasonable and good-natured post. All this speaks well of him--and I happen to know that he had the article sent to him in Mexico so he could read it before responding, which speaks even better of him still.
</p>
<p>
Rich: That leaves you and me, again, old Valve disputants. The article was a provocation, you&#8217;re absolutely right. And let us a pause for a moment before the awesome might of the internet: The two bloggers whom the past week did the most to discredit (will we blog readers ever forget the classic thread that followed Ed&#8217;s posting of the n+1 photo? You can&#8217;t buy that kind of entertainment)---I say, those two bloggers hadn&#8217;t even read the article in question. That, my friends, is magic.

</p>
<p>
There are really two different types of policing being talked about, though.&nbsp; Disapproving of Email publishing is policing basic etiquette.&nbsp; Telling people who are making noise that they are not the real lit-bloggers and that they should shut up is another kind of policing entirely.
</p>
<p>
I know that you want to wrap up, but I obviously have the tendency to go on and on once started.&nbsp; So I think that there&#8217;s a more basic problem with the policing idea than the distinction that I make in the paragraph above.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the concept of &#8220;representing&#8221;, as in &#8220;who are the real people who represent literary blogging to the mainstream media&#8221;.&nbsp; The concept of this kind of representation leads straight back to being &#8220;unwitting stenographers of hip talk and marketing speak&#8221;, doesn&#8217;t it?&nbsp; The purpose of literary blogging should be to write something insightful, not to make a good impression on the media.
</p>
<p>
If no one was reading, that would be a problem.&nbsp; But look at technorati (which measures linkage, not readership directly, but it&#8217;s the best available proxy that I know of).&nbsp; The Valve ranks around 13,000, Acephalous 2,200 (ranking raised by links from his meme experiment, maybe), Long Sunday 26,000.&nbsp; Return of the Reluctant 5,700, The Elegant Variation 7,200, Metaxucafe seems fragmented, but probably about 40,000.&nbsp; As I&#8217;d expect, there are fewer people interested in academic-literary blogs than in interviews, reviews, or current events.&nbsp; But the difference in visibility between the groups is just not as large as you imply.
