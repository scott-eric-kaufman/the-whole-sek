<h3>Observations on the Latest Modern Fiction Studies</h3>
<p class="author">Posted by <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/member/79/">Scott Eric Kaufman</a> on 01/30/07 at 10:22 PM</p>

<p>The <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern_fiction_studies/toc/mfs52.4.html">Winter 2006</a> number of <i>Modern Fiction Studies</i> hit the streets this morning.&nbsp; This issue is special, devoted to what it calls &#8220;graphic narrative,&#8221; but which everyone I know calls &#8220;funny books.&#8221;  <i>De gustibus</i>, yes, but accompanied by a strong impulse to legitimize the objects they&#8217;re studying.&nbsp; After all, this is <i>MFS</i>, not <a href="http://www.msu.edu/~tjpc/"><i>The Journal of Popular Culture</i></a>.&nbsp; For the sake of reference, the <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern_fiction_studies/toc/mfs52.2.html">previous special issue</a> (Summer 2006) was devoted to Toni Morrison, not exactly a marginal figure in contemporary literature.&nbsp; Reading the <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern_fiction_studies/v052/52.4chute01.html">introduction</a> and first three essays, I sense that the audience of this issue is <i>MFS</i> readers, not scholars of the works in question.</p>

<p>More evidence: Art Spiegelman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679748407/diesekoschmar-20"><i>Maus</i></a> rests the on the tip of everyone&#8217;s tongues.&nbsp; Not that <i>Maus</i> isn&#8217;t brilliant—although, what with my interest in <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/academic_advoca.html">race and essentialism</a> in contemporary literary studies and <i>fin de siècle</i> evolutionary theory, I find elements of it highly problematic—only that scholars have been embracing it for the better part of two decades.&nbsp; <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu">Project Muse</a> alone pulls up 261 references to it, many of which with serious, scholarly titles like Erin Heather McGlothlin&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/narrative/v011/11.2mcglothlin.html">No Time Like the Present: Narrative and Time in Art Spiegelman&#8217;s <i>Maus</i></a>&#8220; and Victoria A. Elmwood&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/biography/v027/27.4elmwood.html">&#8216;Happy, Happy, Ever After&#8217;: The Transformation of Trauma between the Generations in Art Spiegelman&#8217;s <i>Maus: A Survivor&#8217;s Tale</i></a>.&#8221;  Being the subject of articles in <i>Narrative</i> and <i>Biography</i> indicates a work has acquired canonical cachet—so much, in fact, that its mention lends prestige to the lowly genre to which it belongs.&nbsp; Hillary Chute and Marianne DeKoven, the editors of this issue, say as much:</p>

<blockquote><p>The project of this special issue is to bring the medium of comics—its conventions, its violation of its own conventions, <i>what it does differently</i>—to the forefront of conversations about the political, aesthetic, and ethical work of narrative. For many of us interested in graphic narrative, without any clear-cut methodology established for considering contemporary comics texts as multilayered narrative works (aside from debates within the field of postmodern fiction and postmodernism generally), and, until recently, without a range of examples to sit next to <i>Maus</i> on our bookshelves, <i>Maus</i> itself set the terms for ways to talk about what comics could do. It continues to set the terms, as a great, lasting work.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<p>While I endorse all Chute and DeKoven say here, I&#8217;m a little perplexed by the notion that &#8220;until recently, without a range of examples to sit next to <i>Maus</i> on our bookshelves.&#8221;  <em>Cerebus</em>—about which I&#8217;ll say more in a minute—hit its stride thirty years ago with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0919359078/diesekoschmar-20"><i>High Society</i></a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0919359094/diesekoschmar-20"><i>Church and State</i></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0919359124/diesekoschmar-20"><i>Jaka&#8217;s Story</i></a>; Neil Gaiman started publishing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563890119/diesekoschmar-20"><i>The Sandman</i></a> in 1988; the first volume of <i>Maus</i> appeared in 1986.&nbsp; All of which is only to say, if someone couldn&#8217;t find <i>something</i> to put on their shelves alongside <i>Maus</i>, they must not have been looking.&nbsp; And before anyone complains this is my inner enthusiast speaking, let me state plainly:</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t.&nbsp; It&#8217;s my inner <i>historicist</i>—who is, admittedly, no less petulant—compelling me to defend the genre.&nbsp; Spiegelman may have been key to its acceptance in academic circles, but he sits at the end of a long tradition; one which, as long traditions will, contains a robust culture of immanent critique.&nbsp; To return to Dave Sim&#8217;s <i>Cerebus</i>: it began as a parody of works like <i>Conan</i>, <i>Red Sonja</i> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Valiant"><i>Prince Valiant</i></a>, but eventually became a 6,000 page novel about conflicts between political and religious authorities, abuses of power and <a href="http://www.cerebusfangirl.com/artists/tangent2.php">the feminist-homosexualist axis</a>.&nbsp; The open <a href="http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22954">embrace of misogyny</a> is certainly unfortunate, but it points to one aspect of funny books the focus on &#8220;graphic narratives&#8221; or &#8220;graphic novels&#8221; ignores—being produced monthly, they capture the development of a person&#8217;s thought in a way other, more novelistic genres cannot.&nbsp; The Dave Sim who in 1995 <a href="http://www.theabsolute.net/misogyny/sim.html#texts">wrote</a> &#8220;Male Light does not Merge ... Thinking, Reason, is best served by solitude, isolation&#8221; is not the same man who appropriated Oscar Wilde&#8217;s voice to tell the story of a young woman coming to terms with her life in <i>Jaka&#8217;s Story</i>.</p>

<p>Or maybe he is.&nbsp; It&#8217;s arguable.&nbsp; However, the inability to revise work once it&#8217;s been published—to smooth over stylistic infelicities, to correct errors of fact or judgment—means that what comic artists produce is a record of thought unlike the one produced by novelists.&nbsp; Intellectual and artistic development can be tracked, month by month, in a way only available to students of the novel after their teachers have died.&nbsp; All of which is only to say that the focus on &#8220;graphic narratives&#8221; fails to address this particular historicist&#8217;s pet concerns.&nbsp; Which is fine.&nbsp; In the coming days, I&#8217;ll address the articles individually.&nbsp; Maybe it&#8217;s because this is the first time since I renounced my Joycean heritage that I&#8217;ve read <em>every single primary text</em> discussed in an article, but for some reason, I feel eminently qualified to analyze this issue of <em>MFS</em>.

<a name="14235"></a><p>I wouldn&#8217;t say that there are no examples of novels that track this progression of thought.&nbsp; What about Dickens or other 18th century writers who wrote their novels as serializations?&nbsp; Or something like Don Quixote, whose second part was written much later than and comments on the first?
</p>
<p>
That said, I think your main point is valid.&nbsp; There&#8217;s something to be said about serious academics finding something to say about graphic &#8220;novels&#8221; without wanting to touch old-fashioned, serialized comics, presumably because of they don&#8217;t want their colleagues to think that they do &#8220;Spider-Man Studies&#8221; or something.
</p>
<p>
It seems similar to television studies, long a bastard child of film studies.&nbsp; Only recently have people been able to take TV seriously.&nbsp; HBO has something to do with that, I believe, but TV studies needs to look at both &#8220;The Honeymooners&#8221; and &#8220;The Sopranos,&#8221; not just the more respectable, &#8220;novel-like&#8221; one.

This doesn&#8217;t surprise me. And I&#8217;m even a bit reluctant to bring it up here, as I fear it may derail whatever it is you&#8217;re attempting to do. Still, if you&#8217;re interested in what happens when you publish a story segment by segment over a year, three years, a decade, well, manga&#8217;s got lots of titles. And, if it&#8217;s history you want, Japan has a <a href="http://www.nypl.org/press/2006/ehonLL.cfm TARGET=ehon">long tradition of putting words and images</a> on the same page.
</p>
<p>
Still, there are issues.
</p>
<p>
One obvious reason for excluding manga is that you can&#8217;t cover everything, so why not stick to graphic novels? This is cheek-by-jowl with the institutionalization of literary studies by national literature, with comp lit on the side. Yeah, Neil Gaiman was born in Britain, but that&#8217;s English, no? And Marjane Satrapi well . . . a cosmopolitan hard case. But most of the issue seems to be about home-grown stuff. And it&#8217;s also about stuff that&#8217;s &#8220;artsy&#8221; in some way, avant-garde, underground, or just plain cool, artsy and adult. 
</p>
<p>
OTOH, a reason to include manga is that we&#8217;re living in a global world and <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/grooves_grafs_and_toons_transnational_cultural_forms/ TARGET=toons">graphic narrative is an international medium</a>. <i>Maus</i> gets translated into 20+ languages and Japanese manga is available all over the world, in local translation. To the extent that one is interested in word and image together on the page, manga raises those issues as well. And then there is the fact that many of the artists who produce graphic novels are aware of and influenced by manga. Scott McCloud gets mentioned as a theorist of graphic narrative, and he&#8217;s certainly interested in manga. We are, as I said, dealing in an international medium. If you go into the large Barnes and Noble off Union Square in NYC you&#8217;ll find graphic novels and manga in the same place up there on the 4th floor. And if you read the trade press, you&#8217;ll read about how manga is the fastest growing segment of the domestic graphic narrative market.
</p>
<p>
And there&#8217;s the rub.
</p>
<p>
I suspect that the real problem with manga is that so much of it really is for kids, and so much of it, for kids and adults, is produced as mass-market commercial product (though there are artsy niche products). Manga accounts for 30% of Japan&#8217;s annual print production. So manga raises issues of legitimacy and canon and all that stuff. Under what rubric, if any, can a respectable academic study this material? Mighty though the legitimzing powers of <i>Maus</i> may be, it&#8217;s not powerful enough to ward off memories of that other mouse, Mickey, who manages to sneak into Osamu Tezuka&#8217;s classic manga, <i>Metropolis</i>, as a species of giant rat, <i>mikimaus waltdisneus</i>. Still, Tezuka&#8217;s 8-volume life of <i>Buddha</i> has its value, though it was written for 10-year old boys.
</p>
<p>
In any event, the University of Minnesota Press has started publishing an annual volume devoted to manga and anime culture. It&#8217;s called <i>Mechademia</i> and <a href="http://www.mechademia.org/current/ TARGET=mech">the first volume</a> is now available. I&#8217;ve got a little review in it, where I discuss Rintaro&#8217;s <i>Metropolis</i> anime (loosely based on Tezuka&#8217;s manga) in conjunction with Kubrick&#8217;s <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, both of which end in an apocalypse set to bittersweet music.

</p>
<p>
For me, the difference between comic books and graphic novels comes down to Frye&#8217;s distinction between levels of Hero: comic book heroes are always greater than a normal (wo)man, graphic novel heroes are always the same as, if not less than, a normal (wo)man.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
(And what Benn Michaels failed to realize about *Maus* is, well, its whole point: Artie still sees the world as separated racially, and he learned this from Vladek, who has internalized the Nazi ideology about race.&nbsp; The book is about how &#8220;trauma&#8221; is passed down from generation to generation in a family, even when the new generation never actually experienced the direct source of the trauma.&nbsp; This isn&#8217;t about racial inheritance; it&#8217;s what actually happens in households.&nbsp; It&#8217;s why abused children become adult abusers.&nbsp; It&#8217;s why the children of survivors often eat their meals as if they are being hounded by Nazis and starving comrades.)
</p>
<p>
Lucky for me, iTunes decided to randomly shuffle to Rocket From the Tombs&#8217;s &#8220;Final Solution&#8221; as I was writing this: &#8220;I don&#8217;t need a cure / I need a final solution.&#8221;

</p>
<p>
<i>Sandman</i>&#8216;s an interesting example here, though, since it&#8217;s a serial treated as if it were a &#8220;graphic narrative.&#8221;  Overall though, I&#8217;m a little annoyed by my tone in this post, as I really don&#8217;t want to seem so critical of the leap <i>MFS</i>&#8216;s made to publish this issue and recognize the quality of work that&#8217;s, well, of variable but occasionally high quality.
</p>
<p>
Bill, I knew I could leave the manga up to you.&nbsp; (I&#8217;ve never read much, and when I try, find the conventions too jarring.&nbsp; I still snobbishly associate it with the <i>Robotech</i> reruns I woke up at 5 a.m. to watch as a kid.)
</p>
<p>
Luther, I&#8217;d forgotten WBM wrote about <i>Maus</i>, and had come to my annoyance independently.&nbsp; (Or thought I had.)  Your comment makes me think I ought to re-read it before continuing this conversation.
</p><p class="commentauthor">By <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com">Scott Eric Kaufman</a> on 01/31/07 at 01:52 PM | <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/observations_on_the_latest_modern_fiction_studies/#14246">Permanent link to this comment</a></p><a name="14247"></a><p>Scott,  whether or not you read manga is of course your business. We&#8217;ve all got our own agendas and more than enough things to think about. (For example, I own <i>Maus</i> but haven&#8217;t read it yet.)
</p>
<p>
But <i>MFS</i> had a bunch of writers and maybe a third of them writing on <i>Maus</i> and no one even mentioning that graphic narrative is a mainstay of the Japanese publishing industry. I felt a bit like what Carrie described at the MLA: listening to people wax eloquent about the potential of the internet without any apparent experience in the blogosphere. 
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;d have been much happier if they&#8217;d dared, say, one article on manga. But I&#8217;d have been satisfied simply if the introductory article had said as much about manga as I did in the comment above, along with begging off on it in any of the perfectly reasonable ways available. Then I&#8217;d at least know that they had some sense of what&#8217;s out there. As it is . . . How can you advance a political criticism in this day and age that is apparently so West-o-centric? And gender issues? robots and cyberspace? All over manga.
</p>
<p>
In 15 or 20 years are we going to have one institutional system for graphic novels and a different and non-overlapping one for manga? How are you going to maintain that in the face of a population that&#8217;s growing up on both?

&#8220;But it was the first comic book that one could read on a bus once one was older than 10 without feeling like a perv.&#8221;  Naw, that&#8217;d be Eisner&#8217;s graphic novels, at the latest.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;For me, the difference between comic books and graphic novels comes down to Frye’s distinction between levels of Hero: comic book heroes are always greater than a normal (wo)man, graphic novel heroes are always the same as, if not less than, a normal (wo)man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
But we already have Frye&#8217;s terminology for that.&nbsp; Why muddy the waters by introducing a content-linked definition of a form?&nbsp; It&#8217;s like the old saw, &#8220;If you say, &#8216;To me, a movie has a story about falling in love with Meg Ryan:&nbsp; if it doesn&#8217;t have that, it&#8217;s a film,&#8217; you won&#8217;t find many other people to accept your definitions.&#8221;

Another thing on legitimacy. If you present a handfull of graphic narratives as being somehow experimental you don&#8217;t really have to challenge the notion that cartoons are for kids. But when you&#8217;re dealing with books being read by adults in one of the advanced (post)industrial civilizations, that&#8217;s troublesome. Maybe the Japanese are just crazy and decadent, or maybe comics aren&#8217;t just for kids. What are we evading or repressing by consigning comics to kids?

So the central revelations in the storyline, the fantasy elements 200 issues old that needed resolving (what&#8217;s up with Cerebus and &#8216;Cirin,&#8217; etc.) were always set in stone, and when <em>Minds</em> came around &#8216;New Dave&#8217; was working within constraints that &#8216;Old Dave&#8217; had put up decades before. That tension grants the middle books of the series an extraordinary richness - Sim isn&#8217;t just writing a polemic, he&#8217;s criticizing his own old imagined cultural framework.
</p>
<p>
Worth comparing to the evolution of something like <em>NYPD Blue</em> or <em>Seinfeld</em> or <em>The X-Files</em> over a period of many years, during which the creators&#8217; relationships to the work changed radically.
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;d be interesting to see sustained analysis of the tonal shifts, changes in characterization, and flat-out contradictions in the book leading up to that time, after which he was improvising and responding to his whims in-the-moment. <em>Cerebus</em> is somewhat radioactive even now, but I think it offers more material for scholars than any other series - intentionally and unintentionally.

</p>
<p>
I just heard a great conference paper by Jeffrey Tucker of the University of Rochester that addressed some angles of this issues.&nbsp; What else have people been hearing/reading about lately that relates?
</p>
<p>
There&#8217;s so much to say about manga and anime:&nbsp; their relation to Disney; their multiple genres and audiences/fan cultures (never knew there were slash versions of hit anime/manga, but there are); their vectors of globalization (just read a piece in <i>The Japan Times</i> on their popularity in France); their gender and cultural politics, within and outside Japan....
</p>
<p>
From the few people I&#8217;ve met in Japan working in cultural studies, I&#8217;ve heard the manga/anime industry is starting to target older readers more, as they&#8217;re beginning to have trouble drawing in younger readers.&nbsp; Giant <i>Robotech</i> special edition &#8220;statues&#8221; sell for hundreds of dollars, so there&#8217;s a big nostalgia market for the old kids&#8217; stuff, too.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m not sure what they&#8217;re worried about, though, as kids&#8217; tv is saturated with anime--such as a hilarious send-up of the &#8220;wise ronin who solve people&#8217;s problems&#8221; (that is, A-Team) conventions in <i>Zen Mai Samurai</i>, and even wackier things like ninja school and cooking school shows I don&#8217;t even know the titles of.&nbsp; <i>Shinchan Curayon</i> is comparable to <i>South Park</i>.
</p>
<p>
Things move so quickly, though, that they just released a <i>Stand Alone Complex</i> movie that tried to monkeywrench the tv series back into the <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> chronology (an impossible task, but one clearly designed to get younger audiences interested in the ancient history that is the first <i>GitS</i> movie here).
</p>
<p>
But maybe that&#8217;s the problem--what with the video games and the cell phones and the tv and movies, old-fashioned manga may be in trouble....
</p>
<p>
I can report that there are many fewer people reading manga in the subways than I would have expected, at least in the parts of Fukuoka I&#8217;m commuting on at the hours I am.&nbsp; (Like 1 or 2 people in not-so-crowded subway car average.)  But people still tend to treat the convenience and book store offerings as reading rooms, so that aspect of manga culture seems alive and well, in Chiba and Fukuoka, at least.
</p>
<p>
More at Mostly Harmless over time....

On kiddie lit, Beverly Lyon Clark has considered the &#8220;just for kids&#8221; issue quite extensively in her <i>Kiddie Lit:  The Cultural Construction of Children’s Literature in America</i>, which <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/kiddie_lit/ TARGET=kiddie-lit">I&#8217;ve discussed briefly on The Valve</a>. One point she argues is that in the US, we didn&#8217;t have a well-institutionalized distinction between children&#8217;s literature and adult literature until the first quarter of the 20th century. 
</p>
<p>
As for Disney and manga-anime, yes of course. But not exclusively Disney. I&#8217;ve seen it argued, for example, that the big eye conventions of manga and anime derive from the early Fleisher Brothers (Betty Boop). Don&#8217;t know whether I believe that or not, but there&#8217;s more than Disney going on.
</p>
<p>
As for adult readers of manga, they&#8217;ve certainly been targeted for years; though I have no sense of whether or not that&#8217;s on the rise. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Wolf_and_Cub TARGET=wolf">Lone Wolf and Club</a> has a level of historical seriousness and violence that suggests it was conceived for an adult audience. It first appears in 1970 and continued for a decade.

</p>
<p>
Bill Benzon mentioned the journal Mechademia: An Academic Forum for Anime, Manga and the Fan Arts &lt;http://mechademia.org&gt;. My wife Martha Cornog and I are Review and Commentary Editors for Mechademia, and Martha also co-writes the graphic novels column in Library Journal. If you&#8217;d like to know what serious scholarly analysis of anime and manga looks like, the articles and reviews we&#8217;re publishing in Mechademia will give you one answer&#8212;Volume 1 is now published, Volume 2 is awaiting publication, and we&#8217;re now working on Volume 3. 
</p>
<p>
We publish analyses and critiques in the field by Anglophone and Japanese scholars (the journal is in English), including papers on (among other things) Hayao Miyazaki (Susan Napier), werewolves in anime (Antonia Levi), globalization of manga (Wendy Suiyi Wong), costume play (Theresa Winge), video game design (Mark Wolf), the rediscovery of Mori Minoru (Tatsumi Takayami), Revolutionary Girl Utena (Mari Kotani), plus a variety of reviews by Patrick Drazen, Brian Ruh, Bill Benzon, and us. It&#8217;s an eclectic and interesting mix. We&#8217;re trying to avoid both fan-burbling ("otaku speak") and pomo-litcritese, and so far we&#8217;ve succeeded.
</p>
<p>
In their introduction to the MFS issue about graphic narratives, Hillary Chute and Marianne DeKoven wrote that Art Spiegelman&#8217;s Maus is &#8220;... arguably the world&#8217;s most famous comics work...&#8221; (p. 768). I just Googled &#8220;Maus + Spiegelman&#8221; and got 416,000 hits for the combination, whereas Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata&#8217;s &#8220;Death Note&#8221; yielded 1,380,000 hits for &#8220;Death Note + manga&#8221; (original, Shueisha, 2003; US translation, Viz, 2006). &#8220;Sailor Moon&#8221; yielded 2,200,000 hits, &#8220;Batman + comic&#8221; gave 2,820,000 hits, and &#8220;Superman + comic&#8221; gave 1,730,000 hits. 
</p>
<p>
To be sure, Googling provides only a rough index of the elusive concept of being famous, but &#8220;Maus&#8221; got about 15-30% of the hits of the really famous comics. And may I suggest, with all due courtesy, that if one can&#8217;t rattle off the characters and plotlines of &#8220;Death Note&#8221; and &#8220;Sailor Moon,&#8221; then perhaps one is a little bit less well informed than one thinks?
</p>
<p>
And if it then boils down to someone saying disdainfully that &#8220;Maus&#8221; is Good Literature, whereas &#8220;Death Note&#8221; and &#8220;Sailor Moon&#8221; are not, then we had best admit to overt and in-your-face snobbery. Personally, I think that if one wants to understand what the modern transnational world is (in part) about, then such snobbery is simply counter-productive.

And it&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re fantasies: I recently read a fantasy &#8220;graphic narrative&#8221; which I would place on the same level as <i>Maus,</i> but it was in Japanese. (It&#8217;s Kotobuki Shiriagari&#8217;s <i>Yaji Kita in DEEP,</i> if anyone&#8217;s interested.)
</p>
<p>
There may also be a more pragmatic reason why <i>Cerebus</i> and <i>Sandman</i> haven&#8217;t been studied very much. <i>Maus,</i> in two small paperback volumes, is fairly inexpensive. The complete <i>Cerebus</i> and <i>Sandman,</i> on the other hand, are very expensive, particularly the former. And until recently academic libraries were unlikely to carry them (probably most still don&#8217;t). Of course, this doesn&#8217;t apply to <i>Watchmen,</i> another title you could have cited. But yeah, that quote Perper cited about <i>Maus</i> is incredibly blinkered: sort of like those people who allegedly couldn&#8217;t believe Bush won (or &#8220;won") because nobody they knew voted for him.
</p>
<p>
As far as following changes in an author&#8217;s world-view, <i>Cerebus</i> is a special case: few comic-book authors work on a single narrative for over thirty years, and few undergo such violent shifts in their opinions over the course of a single narrative. And even with <i>Cerebus,</i> you can&#8217;t really follow Sim&#8217;s views changing month-to-month: Sim&#8217;s particular brand of misogyny must have been brewing for a while before it burst forth in 1986, to the consternation of many of his fans.
</p>
<p>
And comics creators can revise their works from the original serialization when they&#8217;re collected. Most don&#8217;t, either because it&#8217;s too much work or because they think of the original comic books as primary, but I can think of a couple who have.
</p>
<p>
The real interesting critical problem, it seems to me, is posed by comic strips, especially the gag ones. It makes no sense to consider each individual daily or Sunday strip as an independent work: much of the meaning of an individual <i>Peanuts</i> or <i>Krazy Kat</i> strip depends upon our previous knowledge of the characters. But it makes no sense to consider the entire run of the strip as a single narrative either. They were never meant to be read that way, and if you did consider <i>Peanuts,</i> say, as a single narrative, it would be incredibly diffuse and repetitious. And it wasn&#8217;t even possible to read most strips this way, unless you cut each strip out of the newspaper and put it in a scrapbook (as some people did). This last is less true than it used to be, with the growing number of strips collected in complete or near-complete form. But in the case of classic strips, most of these collections are far from complete, and of the ones that are, very rarely are all the volumes still in print.
</p>
<p>
But despite these reservations, I&#8217;m looking forward very much to Scott&#8217;s analyses of the individual articles.

<p>
Of course, there are manga that are as worth literary study as Maus is, and ignoring them in an anthology that purports to be about literary graphic narratives would seem to be the real problem.&nbsp; The bit about Maus being the most famous, as evident shorthand for &#8220;most famous among literary graphic narratives known of by us&#8221;, points up the gap in what&#8217;s being said&#8212;but that gap is not the non-inclusion of Sailor Moon manga.

His comment raises a very significant issue and point of view, so let me treat this as a “teachable moment” and make several points about comics and manga criticism.
</p>
<p>
Probably many students have found William Faulkner and John Milton repetitious and boring. Simplistic too, if they don&#8217;t bother to read either writer. But the step from such purely personal opinions and reactions to asserting that *therefore* neither Faulkner or Milton produced good literature leads us astray. If I say that Milton isn&#8217;t a good writer because he bores me, then I&#8217;m guilty of a fallacy: that maybe I, in my boredom, am missing something of great importance.
</p>
<p>
Rich, I gather that you know very little about “Sailor Moon,” if only because you said it was written for children. When “Sailor Moon” was first introduced to the United States in the mid-1990s, it was indeed marketed to children (by that word, I mean people under about 12 years old, rather than children in the genealogical sense that my sister and I are my parents&#8217; children). It was a marketing failure, partly because “Sailor Moon” deals with themes like vengeance and lineage that don&#8217;t interest children very much. But when it was re-marketed to adolescents and young adults, it became immensely popular. It is long - 18 volumes in the manga, and 200 episodes in the anime (ca. 87 hours) - and is quite intricate in its characters, their relationships and obligations, and in its artwork and narration. And it may bore you witless.
</p>
<p>
But, in my opinion, criticism and analysis of comics and graphic narrative must go beyond such purely personal responses to begin the far harder tasks of cultural, graphical, and aesthetic analysis. Methods and approaches for achieving those goals have been emerging in recent years, and they will continue to emerge. Yet - again, a personal opinion - we need to go beyond personal opinion in these forms of critical and analytical effort.

</p>
<p>
Perhaps you would like to compare it to Harry Potter?&nbsp; Adults blog quite a bit about Harry Potter, but if someone says that it&#8217;s a children&#8217;s work, they don&#8217;t say that well you&#8217;d be bored reading Milton, and that you must not think that Harry Potter is worth the same level of effort because the series is lengthy and uses complex themes.&nbsp; The fact that it&#8217;s a very good children&#8217;s series does not make it a literary work.
</p>
<p>
Presentation of _Sailor Moon_ as if it should be in the same category as _Maus_ appears to me to be a failure of cultural analysis, frankly, and coming uncomfortably close to exoticism.&nbsp; While knowledge of the Japanese context and of the genre is clearly necessary, methods and approaches of literary analysis do not need to be reinvented for manga simply because the style originated in Japan.

<i> . . . methods and approaches of literary analysis do not need to be reinvented for manga simply because the style originated in Japan.</i>
</p>
<p>
But we do need methods for analyzing the intertwining of text and image on the page. Scott McCloud&#8217;s work may well be the best we currently have. And shōjo manga, such as <i>Sailor Moon</i>, presents some very interesting issues in this regard.

</p>
<p>
Sure, critical methods for analyzing the intertwining of text and image on the page are in a very early stage of development.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t see what that has to do with this point.&nbsp; What are the issues that shōjo manga present that other manga do not?

Your point is perfectly clear: you don&#8217;t like &#8220;Sailor Moon,&#8221; you&#8217;re bored by it,  and therefore think that it must be bad literature (even though in your reply to Bill Benzon you weren&#8217;t able to define good OR bad literature). Why do you have to buffer your opinions with all these intellectual gyrations? You don&#8217;t like it; that&#8217;s it.

But your opinion is NOT an analytical or critical judgment. It&#8217;s a personal opinion and preference, and that is all.

You&#8217;re not analyzing &#8220;Sailor Moon&#8221; or its immense appeal (2.2 million hits). You&#8217;re saying only that you find it yucky in ways you haven&#8217;t been able to define. That&#8217;s not enough.

But, such examination and discussion are applied ONLY to those texts judged to be good. It is simply assumed that the bad ones do not measure up on those rather vague standards. 
</p>
<p>
One of the standard cliches is that good texts can support many readings; that&#8217;s a measure of their goodness. And, what do you know, we have many readings for the good texts. That&#8217;s because the community that believes this doesn&#8217;t bother to provide readings for bad texts.
</p>
<p>
As for the value of these readings, my guess is that it has more to do with the critic than with the text or texts being criticized.
</p>
<p>
What we do not have anywhere, as far as I know, are explicit criteria applied to a wide variety of texts with the evaluations being done in some way that permits objective comparison between valuations. 
</p>
<p>
The issue is not, of course, your personal taste, Tim, nor mine, nor Rich&#8217;s. That&#8217;s irrelevant. The issue is how one builds an intellectual discipline. Can you build an intellectual discipline on collective aesthetic judgments negotiated through vague concepts?

Since you evidently are, I should mention that children&#8217;s literature can be read by adults for enjoyment for all sorts of reasons: because they have children, or because they want to relax, or because they are nostalgic, or because they interpret it as camp, or because it becomes a peer marker of coolness, or because they admire a well-made piece of children&#8217;s literature.

<p>
But if you can&#8217;t describe a work as repetitive, simplistic. or made for children without being accused of making personal judgements, then I don&#8217;t see how you can describe anything.&nbsp;  Complexity and genre, as characteristics of works, are more evaluable than nearly anything else.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it will help if I figure out what the bottom of the barrel of my anime-watching or manga-reading is and admit to enjoying it.&nbsp; OK, I&#8217;ve watched about five season&#8217;s worth of _Dragon Ball_, in an English-translated version.&nbsp; If anything at all could be described as repetitive, simplistic, or intended for children, DBZ certainly could be.&nbsp; It was enjoyable because of the circumstances involved.&nbsp; But the fact that &#8220;dragon ball&#8221; + anime got 1.8 million Google hits does not mean that literary analysis of the series is warranted.&nbsp; Sure, I could make up something for Joseph&#8217;s two-parter on apocalypticism based on it, just as someone could write something Butlerian on Haruka Tenoh from Sailor Moon.&nbsp; But if you can&#8217;t even admit to the evident qualities of the work, you can&#8217;t even try the dubious re-use of pop culture as literary fodder.

No one is impressed that you have watched Dragon Ball. Millions of people have. The reason I won&#8217;t discuss Sailor Moon with you is that you haven&#8217;t convinced me that you have anything  to say about it except to confuse your personal opinions with critical, analytical, and scholarly knowledge. Those of us who work in this area DO think that Dragon Ball is worth critical analysis, and so are Sailor Moon, Fruits Basket, and many more.
</p>
<p>
For everyone else who is reading this thread, the reason I  am making these points is that they are directly relevant to what the MFS essays are about and to Scott Eric Kaufman&#8217;s comments dealt with. To a large extent, comics/graphic narrative &#8220;criticism&#8221; up to now has been built along the lines illustrated by Rich Pulchalsky&#8217;s comments&#8212;that is, on **personal** preferences and opinions. We in the field are trying&#8212;and starting to succeed&#8212;in moving away from these kinds of fan-speak comments. They do not provide any sure guidelines to comprehending how graphic narratives work or what they are about logographically or pictographically. Saying something is &#8220;repetitious&#8221; simply isn&#8217;t  analysis. But saying that Sailor Moon deals in part with vengeance and lineage, as I did, is at least a start in the direction I think we should be going.

<p>
Vengeance and lineage are such common tropes in all children&#8217;s literature, graphic or not&#8212;remember my earlier mention of Harry Potter?&#8212;that I don&#8217;t see how they really provide an important opening into an understanding of children&#8217;s graphic narrative in particular.&nbsp; Repetition does.&nbsp; The types of repetition in something like Sailor Moon or Dragon Ball are different than the types of repetition in something like Harry Potter.&nbsp; For instance, Dragon Ball anime has a well-established cyclic structure that goes beyond the necessities of periodic publication&#8212;in addition to the threat-and-response cycle within each episode, and the escalation of moves within each battle in each small sequence of episodes, there&#8217;s a larger alternation between training-and-guru and conflict.&nbsp; That serves to allow for continued progress without progress; Goku can apparently do more and more impressive things, but can never grow out of the frame of the series.&nbsp; In Harry Potter, the repetitive framing still allows for Harry to grow up, and for an eventual end; compare that with adult works like _Kozure Okami_, which can really only escape its cycle of repetition when the vengeance-plus-lineage tropes become subverted and the object of vengeance becomes, symbolically, the foundation of lineage.&nbsp; I recommend reading Umberto Eco&#8217;s piece on closed works like Superman (in his _The Open Work_, if I remember rightly).
</p>
<p>
But the first step in getting any useful analysis out of this is to admit that the series, is, in fact, repetitious and simplistic.

My doctorate is from CUNY, 1969, and by training I&#8217;m a geneticist. For the past 30 or so years, I have been working and writing about a variety of topics in human behavior, including human sexuality and manga, among others. I&#8217;ve written a number of books that you can find on amazon.com. As of the moment, I&#8217;ve published nine papers about manga in the scholarly literature, including a 125 page monograph on depictions of sexuality in manga. You want more information about me? Just ask.
</p>
<p>
And I still insist that personal opinions of the kind you believe represent analysis are counter-productive. You talk glibly&#8212;quoting my mention of vengeance and lineage themes without saying you&#8217;re quoting me (that&#8217;s bad form, Rich)&#8212;about tropes, Harry Potter, Umberto Eco, and Dragon Ball without any point at least I can follow. There are specific ways in which Takeuchi explores lineage obligations in &#8220;Sailor Moon&#8221; that are neither repetitious or simple; in fact, they are ethnographically and narrationally extremely complex. One example is the lack of parallelism within Usagi&#8217;s matriline of Sailor Moon&#8217;s relationship to Queen Serenity (a relationship of respect and admiration from the younger woman to the older progenitrix) and Rini&#8217;s relationship to her mother Sailor Moon (where the younger woman is openly and overtly hostile to her mother). A different kind of obligation is created, and explored extensively by Takeuchi, by relationships **outside** the matriline, e.g., between Usagi and Minako, or between Rei and Ami. Still other kinds of obligation exist between the older &#8220;Outer Planet&#8221; Sailor Senshi (Pluto, Uranus, Neptune) and the younger &#8220;Inner Planet&#8221; Sailor Senshi (Usagi, Rei, Ami, Minako, and Lita). So, in a microcosm depicted through the astronomical metaphor of the solar system, the older and younger Senshi function in older-sister/younger-sister relationships. In consequence, the matriline and its female quasi-kin form a kind of symbolic parallel to the planets themselves (I will defer discussing Takeuchi&#8217;s meanings for the word &#8220;symbol"). Notably absent is the existence of a solar or other Father; this system is matrilineal, not patrilineal (the unmentioned planet Saturn explicitly represents death). Takeuchi works out these parallels or metaphors in considerable detail, and, in turn (!) they are paralleled in the last story arc (the Sailor Stars arc) by the central galactic &#8220;cauldron of stars,&#8221; where all things that were, are, and will be exist in synchronic simultaneity, and which gives birth to the stars and therefore to the planets and their family/matrilineal inner workings.
</p>
<p>
But, for you, &#8220;Sailor Moon&#8221; can be dismissed, in an exercise of considerable arrogance, as repetitious, simplistic, and meant for children. I don&#8217;t care that you know Sailor Uranus&#8217; family name; your opinion of &#8220;Sailor Moon&#8221; is simply wrong. It is anything BUT repetitious or simplistic, and it *certainly* wasn&#8217;t meant for children. No understanding of the cosmology or mythology of &#8220;Sailor Moon&#8221; can come UNLESS we understand the complex relationships Takeuchi sets out among matrilines, maternal kinship, and the solar system and its embedding galaxy. And I have touched on only a few details of those relationships, and have not even come close to talking about vengeance.
</p>
<p>
And if anyone else is still reading this thread, I want to repeat what I have been saying all along: critical, scholarly, and analytical study of graphic narrative must move beyond the assertion of mere opinion.

</p>
<p>
Now, is it really surprising that this example of shōjo manga features older sister/younger sister relationships, motherhood, and not much interest in fathers?&nbsp; The style is for young girls.&nbsp; You can certainly spend a lot of time on how who relates to who in Sailor Moon, just as boys &#8220;studying&#8221; Dragon Ball can work out elaborate charts of comparative power levels.&nbsp; Girls, as the stereotype embedded in the genre goes, are more interested in relationships, so they are given plenty of them.&nbsp; But those relationships are placed there in a neatly symbolic pattern for you to discover; they are simply not as ambiguous or multivalent as those in adult literature.&nbsp; Treating a look at the prefab relationships between these characters as ethnography is an example of scientism.
</p>
<p>
But let&#8217;s see what you&#8217;re leaving out.&nbsp; Feminism and gender roles?&nbsp; No mention.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t really see how any kind of contemporary study of Sailor Moon could avoid them&#8212;unless part of your agenda is indeed to deny that this is a series intended for girls.
</p>
<p>
So I&#8217;m not impressed.&nbsp; The problem with your scholarship, as described, is that it relies on denying facts about the work that are not really in question.&nbsp; It&#8217;s possible to say that it&#8217;s a really good children&#8217;s series, sure, but not &#8220;it *certainly* wasn’t meant for children&#8221;, or, more seriously, to elide the difference between children&#8217;s and adult literature (not to mention literary vs non-literary adult works) in favor of popularity as the measure of all kinds of cultural importance.
</p>
<p>
I do still recommend that you read Eco&#8217;s _The Open Work_.&nbsp; He&#8217;s done some significant study of graphic narratives.

</p>
<p>
I don&#8217;t know what you mean by &#8220;literary analysis&#8221; in phrases like that. Is this a special type of analysis that can only be applied to certified-literary texts or that only produces interesting results when applied to literary texts? This would leave open the possibility of some kind of non-literary analysis. Or do you mean that only certified literary texts are worth the time and attention required for careful analytic work? If so, why? Texts are read by people. The fact that a text is read by a lot of people doesn&#8217;t make it a work of high literary art, but isn&#8217;t the experience of those people worthy of our interest? 
</p>
<p>
I recently did a detailed analysis of  ring-structure in Osame Tezuka&#8217;s <i>Metropolis</i>, a popular one-volume manga published after WWII for an audience of boys. I learned a great deal from that work, as much as I did, for example, early in my career when I worked on symbolic inversion in <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.</i> The fact that the structures I found in that text are somehow accessible to 10 year old boys doesn&#8217;t make them any less interesting or significant. 
</p>
<p>
 <i>Sure, I could make up something for Joseph’s two-parter on apocalypticism based on it, . . . .</i>
</p>
<p>
So high-art apocalypticism is worthy of our attention, but pop-cult apocalypticism is not?

</p>
<p>
The concept of literary certification sounds bad, of course, but in practise it&#8217;s impossible to read wholly without reference to a critical community.&nbsp; It&#8217;s possible for one critic, by sustained effort, to redefine a &#8220;popular&#8221; work as &#8220;literary&#8221;.&nbsp; But it takes a certain kind of effort, and a certain kind of communication.&nbsp; That communication would not be facilitated by denying that <i>Metropolis</i> was published for an audience of boys in the first place.
</p>
<p>
So, if you want to study pop culture, that&#8217;s fine&#8212;but remember, this thread started in terms of comparisons to <i>Maus</i>, and in terms of what the MFS should include.&nbsp; They should not have mentioned Batman instead because it&#8217;s more famous, any more than they should have mentioned Sailor Moon.

There&#8217;s a worthwhile difference between saying &#8220;graphic narrative consists of stuff like <i>Maus</i>&#8220; vs. saying that &#8220;graphic narrative includes a whole bunch of stuff, from children&#8217;s comics to Japanese manga and so forth and so on; but in this issue we&#8217;re interested in in stuff like <i>Maus</i> because X Y Z.&#8221; The former seems insular and ultimately defensive, while the latter seems more open to the world. The difference seems of akin to the one I evoked in <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/benzon10112003.html TARGET=blues">comparing Ken Burns jazz series to Martin Scorsese&#8217;s blues series</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Burns presented a self-absorbed America while Scorsese presented an America both generous and welcoming.
</p>
<p>
Even where Scorsese&#8217;s episodes faltered they offered useful examples for further [documentary] work. The only work that can come from Ken Burns is more Ken Burns. Not only did Burns examine music from the past, but he was always looking to the past, never the present or the future. At their best, Scorsese&#8217;s episodes summoned the past as a source of raw materials for a new and different future. Scorsese managed to display a life and a moral truth that could only be displayed in this medium of moving images and manifest sound. Burns only used the medium to present documents framed in a sepia-toned glow.</p></blockquote>
<p>
When I read the framing of that issue of <i>MFS</i> against my knowledge of the profession, I get worried. Holbo&#8217;s perused the whole issue&#8212;which I have not&#8212;and <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the_funny_pages/ TARGET=holbo">he&#8217;s made a comment</a> that gives me further cause for worry: &#8220;I guess if I have one complaint about the <i>Modern Fiction Studies</i> issue it’s that none of these folks can hold a candle to McCloud. But they all seem to realize that. At least they reference him respectfully.&#8221; But will they try to build on what McCloud&#8217;s done or while they simply do what they know how to do and rest content with respectful reference to his word? My guess&#8212;and it&#8217;s only that, a guess&#8212;is that people who are willing to flat-out ignore the existence of manga are also willing to pay lip service to Scott McCloud forever.
