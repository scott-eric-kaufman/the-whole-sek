Behold!  Yet another exercise in the fine art of the semi-topical link!  I’ve penned two of them: [the first](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/superadequate_s.html) responds to [Sean’s comment](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/theorys_empire_ersatz_theoretical_ecumenicalism_criticism_qua_criticism/#2276) on the value of structural homologies with a discussion of the Charleses Darwin and Babbage, Robert Chambers and _monstrous_ births.  [The second](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/not_bedazzled_b.html) is bi-semi-topical: it looks back to the issues [I raised](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/theorys_empire_ersatz_theoretical_ecumenicalism_criticism_qua_criticism/) about _Theory’s Empire_ by looking forward to the issues I will raise about _The Literary Wittgenstein_.

[Michael Berube](http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/theory_tuesday_iii/) discusses the response to the _Theory’s Empire_ event in this week’s installment of “Theory Tuesday.”  An impressive discussion of Roman Jakobson and structuralism follows.  

Kriston of [the Grammar Police](http://grammarpolice.net/archives/000732.php) discusses the event and informs us that if we like _Theory’s Empire_ we may also like the first two seasons of _Saved by the Bell_.

Prof. Camico--who’s excellent blog [Academic Splat!](http://camicao.blogspot.com/) is for some inexplicable reason not on The Valve’s blogroll [Done. - the editor] --confesses that while he’s [not much of a theory-head](http://camicao.blogspot.com/2005/07/not-much-of-theory-head-but.html), he may know the best way to learn theory.  

ADDITIONS: Chris Cagle places himself squarely between Berube and Holbo over on [Left-Center-Left](http://leftcenterleft.typepad.com/blog/2005/07/postposttheory.html).

_As usual, if there are any posts I missed, email me and I’ll rectify the situation._

But does he mention our TE event? No?

Today’s WSJ Leisure&Arts includes [Mich St’s] James Seaton’s review of Thoery’s Empire. Mostly nonnoteworthy; the most cogent bit:

“A sign that things may be changing is ‘Theory’s Empire,’ edited by Daphne Patai and Will Corral. Its 47 contributors patiently dissect all aspects of Theory, from its putative grounding in the ideas of Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913) to the practical effects—say, in India—of the postcolonial (’poco’) branch of Theiry, which does so much to denigrate logic and reason.

“Valentine Cunningham, Raymond Tallis and other contributors show how much theorists distort Saussure’s insights. Contrary to what the theorists claim, the arbitrary aspects of language as a syste (langue) in no way imply that individual speech acts (parole) must be likewise arbitrary and thus incapable of communicating truths. ‘The confusion between the system and its use,’ notes Mr. Tallis—e.g., between the arbitrary rules of syntax and the particular meaning of a sentence—is ‘especially unforgivable in writers who claim to be familiar with Saussure, as it was one of the latter’s great achievements to distinguish these things.’”

(Nor does he mention TheValve.)
