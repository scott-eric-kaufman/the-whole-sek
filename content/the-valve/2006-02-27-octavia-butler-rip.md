[Octavia Butler](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/books/260959_butlerobit26ww.html") died on Friday.  I've written a [couple](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/faith_in_noveli.html) of [appreciations](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/12/readerresponse_.html) in the past, but they're entirely inadequate.  As is anything I could write now.  Wow.  I'm in shock.  This is my first favorite author to die on me.

That's terrible news! An icon for experimental sci-fi and fantasy... 

From "Bloodchild":

I'm told I was first caged wtihin T'Gatoi's many limbs only three minutes after my birth. A few days later, I was given my first taste of egg. I tell Terrans that when they ask whether I was ever afraid of her. And I tell it to Tlic when T'Gatoi suggests a young Terran child for them and they, anxious and ignorant, demand an adolescent. Even my brother who had somehow grown up to fear and distrust the Tlic could probably have gone smoothly into one of their families if he had been adopted early enough. Sometimes, I think for his sake he should have been. I looked at him, stretched out on the floor across the room, his eyes open, but glazed as he dreamed his egg dream. No matter what he felt toward the Tlic, he always demanded his share of egg.

And here are a couple of Octavia Butler short stories free at scifi.com, in case anyone wants to get more of a flavor for her style:

That's horrific and saddening news. What a shock.

It'll take a long time to come to terms with this.

Longer than we live, I expect.
