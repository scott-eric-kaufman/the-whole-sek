On occasion, it’s an honor [not even to be nominated](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/sep/18/science-fiction-booker-prize):

[Kim Stanley Robinson] believes this year’s [Man Booker] prize should go to Adam Roberts’s science fiction comedy, [_Yellow Blue Tibia_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575083573/diesekoschmar-20), which didn’t even make the longlist.

This comes not two weeks after [an appearance on Neil Gaiman’s bookshelf](http://blog.shelfari.com/.a/6a00d8341e478253ef0120a4e31ac1970b-pi).  I’d like to say I’m not jealous—but I’d be lying.

Thanks Scott!  What makes this especially boggleworthy for me, as I said [at my author site](http://www.adamroberts.com/2009/09/21/booker-prize-2009/) is this angle: ‘if somebody staged a four way hike-off between Robinson, Le Guin, Delany and Gene Wolfe for the title “world’s greatest living science fiction author” I’d put my money on Robinson.’  In part that’s because in _Galileo’s Dream_ KSR has just published one of his very best books.  (Though it’s worth adding: Le Guin has also just published _Lavinia_, similarly stratsopheric).

Thanks for this post! alerted to the stir caused by Robinson, I whipped up a historicals vs. science fiction review idea for the Austin Statesman. Unfortunately, although my historical - Ackroyd’s Frankenstein - is distributed in the U.S., I couldn’t find Adam Roberts new novel, so I am using Paulo Bacigalupi’s the windup girl. 

I owe y’all a hook.
