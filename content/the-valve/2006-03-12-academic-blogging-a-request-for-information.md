If you could spare a minute of your time, I wonder if you could help me tabulate geographic distribution of our readership for my forthcoming article in [_the minnesota review_](http://www.theminnesotareview.org/).  All you need to do is create a [Frappr!](http://www.frappr.com) account and join [The Valve](http://www.frappr.com/thevalve) group.  (No, this isn’t a scientific study; I want to see whether a self-selecting group of motivated readers turns up data roughly equivalent to what I’ve gathered from the various hit counters out there.  I don’t trust ‘em.)

Also, if you’re a regular or semi-regular reader of Acephalous, you’re welcome to join the [Acephalous](http://www.frappr.com/acephalous) group too.  (Encouraged, even.)
