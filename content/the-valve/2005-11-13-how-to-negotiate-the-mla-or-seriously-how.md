## How to Negotiate the MLA; or, Seriously, How?

As I browse through the catalogue for the upcoming MLA, I see that there will be a number of unpleasant decisions to be made.  All of them boil down to: “Here or here?”

Do I seat myself at promptly 10:15 on Wednesday morning at the panel on “Citizenship and United States Writing” on which Brook Thomas, one of my dissertator adivors, sits; or do I attend the special session on “Covering Academe,” during which [Scott McLemee](http://mclemee.com/id4.html) will be discussing what it’s like to be “Outside, Looking In”?  This anecdote pretty much sums up the panic I’ll feel when I hit my hotel room on Monday and try to decipher the highlighting schemes I’ve concocted--yellow for “of interest, takes precedence over hunger,” orange for “of interest, but doesn’t,” &amp;c.  

One panel contributors and readers of the Valve will want to attend is the one on “Walter Benn Michael’s _Our America_ Ten Years Later.”  Presenters include Wai Chee Dimock, Kenneth Warren (who spoke at Irvine last year and who I cannot recommend highly enough), and our very own Sean McCann; Michaels himself will respond.  

Quick questions of a more general nature: How many panels before you burn out?  (At the International James Joyce conference a couple of years ago, I drove everyone, myself included, insane by attending three panels a day for four days straight.  I think that may cross the line between “responsible” and “unhealthy.")  What exactly is a “cash bar”?  How do I get invited to all the best parties?  Is dress “business casual,” and if so, what exactly does that mean?  Which David Lodge novels should I re-read before attending?  Or has Lodge been superseded?  Is it considered bad form to slip quietly out of the Q&amp;A session, or is a convincing enough cough fit a better tactic?  (I kid, I kid.  If I left during the Q&amp;A session, I wouldn’t be able to ask the question I’d spent the last half of each presentation perfecting.)

Finally, if you can think of any panels of general interest, feel free to offer suggestions.  I’m thinking “Web Logs as Witness” (Friday, 8:30-9:45) may interest may of us, since we think about the relation of scholarship to blogs to community regularly.  I’m tempted to forget, temporarily, what I learned during nine years of speech therapy and pull rank at the “Deaf Critical Theory and Practice” panel . . . but then I remember that I’m a scholar, not a performance artist, and that such a performance would be considered offensive.  (Then again, had I not written this, they wouldn’t have known about the corrective therapy and could’ve mistaken me for the man I would’ve been without it.  But that, my friends, would be cruel.  When I speak as I once spoke, I am utterly unintelligible.  One summer after I’d completed S.T., I volunteered to help train the speech therapists at the unfortunately acronymed LSD [The Louisiana School for the Deaf].  They said that the particular combination of what I heard vs. what I produced was one of the most bizarre pronunciation schemes they’d ever encountered.  But I sound like Tom Brokaw now, so none of you need worry that you’ll come down with a case of the “come agains” if we meet at the MLA.)

---

And before anyone asks: Yes, I’m well aware of ostensible conflict-of-interest of posting about the MLA on the anti-MLA-sponsored site...but I think we’ll agree that some professional realities _are_ realities, and that attending the MLA is one of them.

I hope no one really thinks of this as an “anti-MLA” sponsored site, because that would be very silly for at least two reasons: it isn’t, and it’d be an impossible thing to be, given the multitudes contained by the MLA.

So let’s please never mention this again.

Don’t know what happened to the comment I posted an  hour ago, but the meat of it was that 1) the fact that I tacked that on in a comment should demonstrate how strongly I felt the need to write it in the first place and 2) Jonathan, what panels will you be attending at the MLA?  

I ask because I’ve highlighted half the program at this point and know that I’ve missed some gems.  So if you know of some people who are “must see,” feel free to post ‘em here.

I do think it is wrong to think of the Valve, or the ALSC, as ‘anti-MLA’. The ALSC might plausibly have been characterized as that 10 years ago, but no longer. Changes in both organizations have made this no longer be the case. On the one hand, the ALSC is really not so interested in breathing culture war fire; it is an organization that advocates styles and sorts of scholarship that are felt (rightly or wrongly) to be under-valued and under-emphasized at present. On the other hand ... well, take Stephen Greenblatt’s 2002 MLA address, which I quoted in my very first Valve post. I’ll just quote that bit again, because it’s handy: 

“People reflecting on the decline of humanities publishing sometimes say that scholars should write for a larger public. We should, the argument goes, not address other scholars alone but try to reach the mass of nonprofessional readers as well. These readers would buy our books and journals were they written more accessibly and thereby solve the economic problem faced by university presses. Though the task seems to me much more difficult than it is often imagined, I am not averse to trying to reach a larger readership. But I doubt that our specialized scholarly work can be successfully couched in a marketable form for the general reader - assuming such a reader still exists - and I doubt that in most cases we should try to do so. In our profession, as in every profession, there are many things that we should simply address to one another.

Our great failure in recent years is not that we no longer write for a general public - as if every significant literary scholar in the past had been a Lionel Trilling or an Edmund Wilson - but rather that we no longer write for one another, not well enough in any case to inspire one another to buy and assign our books.” 

In 1994, this would have been anti-MLA propaganda. (Remember E. Wilson’s caustic “The Fruits of the MLA” piece?) The fact that it is Greenblatt saying it, at the MLA, means that no one is going to oblige him to tediously bat down accusations of sinister and/or ulterior ideological motive. (Is Greenblatt a conservative front organization, a Horowitzian catspaw? Survey says: no.) 

Possibly people might dismiss Greenblatt as merely suffering from grumpy old man syndrome. All old academics become ‘the place has gone to hell in a handbasket’ curmudgeons, maybe. Or maybe not. But my impression is that Greenblatt’s address was not regarded as in shocking bad taste. It has simply become un-eyebrow-raising to acknowledge that the humanities - especially literary studies - is going through a bad patch. Is it so shocking to say so? No. So in a sense a less strident version of what various ALSC folks were saying in 1994 has become rather old hat, by 2002. Not that everyone else has come around to their way of thinking, but a lot of people have worked round, by very different routs, to what amounts to overlapping consensus on a lot of points that would have been hotly disputed before. I think.

This is not to gloss over the very different diagnoses of the problem that may go with the acknowledgement of ‘the problem’. I just think the distance has significantly narrowed to the point where it really makes no sense to think of the ALSC as anti-MLA (unless you also think of the MLA as anti-MLA, as in the case of Greenblatt prez address).

I’m “must see.” Well, I am! Seriously, though, it’s session 493, “Digital Scholarly Publishing: Beyond the Crisis,” the [NCTE](http://www.ncte.org/) session. I bet Jonathan will be at that one, Scott.

Having lived last year a few blocks up Connecticut Ave from the convention site, I thought I’d suggest some things: 

A few steps down from the Woodley Park Metro (right outside the Marriott) are several restaurants, including one doing organic Chinese food.  There is also something called Taverna, which has excellent Lebanese food. The other restaurants are middling.  

A better place to go to eat is about ¾ mile up the hill to Cleveland Park, which has about 20 restaurants of all sorts: sushi, Mexican, Indian, Continental. There is an Italian market there with good pizza by the slice, as well as a sports bar to catch the bowl games.

In Cleveland Park you can also find a post office, public library, and FedEx. 

You might be asked to go down Connecticut a mile to Dupont Circle, but except for Kramer’s Books and Café, the food is overrated and expensive, and the street scene is hectic.

Clancy is right--that’s a can’t-miss panel.

As for the others, I’d suggest imagining what the ideal panel would be, then going to the ones closest to that.

"I just think the distance has significantly narrowed to the point where it really makes no sense to think of the ALSC as anti-MLA (unless you also think of the MLA as anti-MLA, as in the case of Greenblatt prez address).”

But Greenblatt is making an argument based on the economics of scholarly publishing, not based on what is or is not valuable in scholarship.

I agree with gzombie---or at least I think that I do---that the vast bulk of scholarship in literary studies fields has been quite stable in its concerns and methods over the last fifty-hundred years relative to the heat-generating meta-theoretical debates. So it’s a mistake to assume that rapid changes in the latter necessarily affect the former.

Clancy,

After I read your comment and claimed that I try to encourage other people to speak up...I realized I hadn’t actually acknowledged your comment here.  In short, yes, I have highlighted your talk and will be there, bells and all.

Mark,

Thanks for the tips.  Seems like I’ll be headed up the hill thrice daily, then, and I welcome all Valve contributors and readers to drop me a line and accompany one morning, afternoon or early evening.

Jonathan,

I suppose one wonderment I have, but didn’t properly communicate, is which panels are likely to be of intense interest due to factors I can’t anticipate.  For example, are there particular speakers who shouldn’t be missed but, due to gaps in my dinner party knowledge of the academy, I’m entirely unaware of?  

John,

I don’t think the ALSC an anti-MLA, in large part because professional commitments preclude it from being one: Mark and Sean are both presenting at it, and they have good reason to, &amp;c.  In other words, that was pure snark on my part.

Actually no. In that speech he’s explicitly saying that the economics isn’t the whole story. That is, he is explicitly urging that we DON’T make the mistake of missing that the publishing crisis is about value in scholarship, in an intellectual sense not just dollars and cents sense. (The economic problems are so bad that it can seem they are the whole problem.) 

I think this comes through, to some extent, in the bit I quote. If not, you can consult the original for confirmation. 

You can, of course, conclude that he’s got grumpy old academic syndrome and he’s just knee-jerking about ‘hell in a handbasket’ and all. I tend to think he’s right.

Fair enough, but Greenblatt’s reasons for advocating change are signifanctly different from what I take to be the ALSC position.

I don’t want to hijack the comment thread to Scott’s  entry, though.

Look! [Cranberries](http://ghw.wordherders.net/archives/001105.html)!
