## I'm fairly certain they meant that as a compliment.

Via _[io9](http://io9.com/5147328/discover-the-king-of-high+concept-science-fiction-storytelling)_, I learn that one of our authors "deserves more literary fame as a post-modern trickster."  I wonder who [that could be](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=13275)?  (I also learned that I'm about [three novels behind](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=adam%20roberts&tag=diesekoschmar-20&index=books&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325). I blame the dissertation.)

Blimey.

Also, that photo Lou put at the top of his piece?  I was three-quarters-dead when that picture was taken.  Just saying.

An aside: I've tried to think of a title that's more impossible to search for than _On_, and it's down to _The_ and _A_.  The Google search for "[Adam Roberts On](http://www.google.com/search?q=adam+roberts+on)" brings the funny.

As Adam blogs here, I've added that information to his Wikipedia entry.
