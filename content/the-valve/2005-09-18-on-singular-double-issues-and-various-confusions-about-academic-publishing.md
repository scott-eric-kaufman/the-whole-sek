## On Singular Double-Issues and Various Confusions about Academic Publishing

This barely rises above the level of legitimate post, but I’m curious as to why the [Project Muse](http://muse.jhu.edu/) mailer sent me an email this evening containing both these entries:

Journal of Narrative Theory

[Volume 34, Number 3, Fall 2004](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_narrative_theory/toc/jnt34.3.html)

Journal of Narrative Theory

[Volume 35, Number 1, Winter 2005](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_narrative_theory/toc/jnt35.1.html)

Is this some quirk of academic publishing with which I’m unfamiliar?  Or is it actually an unusual event worthy of some discussion?  I can imagine queues of peer-reviewage so clogged by mediocre articles (of the sort I’m currently composing one tediously draining day after another) that when published are _determined to publish it all_...but what I’m really invested in here is following up [Jonathan’s post about peeking behind the curtains](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/another_journal_etiquette_question/).  I know what I’m _told_ happens during the peer review process but don’t know whether that relates to reality of peer reviewing when the lights turn low and the grudges grumble their discontents.  

I say this because I’ve a brilliant friend (much smarter than myself and much more deserving of a sinecure that this lowly Scott) who recently wrote:

One person recommended it entirely, said it was brilliant, etc., with no suggestions for revisions, apart from two footnotes s/he wanted thrown in.  The other reader rejected it entirely, and said that my claims about professionalism were “wildly unsubstantiated” and that I couldn’t fix the paper even if I wanted to, since I was grappling with a massive topic beyond my ken as a literary scholar.  I guess the [journal of high regard] just averaged the difference between the two and sent it back to me for revisions.

Such is the situation that forces me [to toss, tumble and turn on Mamet](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/the_mamet_meets.html) or question whether my self-interested meritorious imaginings belong buried in Alger novels.  (Of course, I could always [idle along the path most travelled](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/on_jager_or_dri.html)...)

I had a pretty positive experience with the reviewers at the [journal of high regard], but I think your friend describes a very common pattern at that particular journal.  When they send a piece to two reviewers, one of those reviewers is on the advisory board of the journal and deals with large numbers of [journal of high regard] submissions.  The other reviewer is carefully selected by the [journal of high regard] staff as an expert on your particular topic.  In my case, for an article that discussed dissection, they found someone who was not just a specialist in the early modern period but someone who focused on early modern medicine and literature (and in fact was on the faculty of a medical school rather than an undergraduate institution).  Many of my friends have told me that the second reader is often much harsher than the advisory board member.

Peer review can be very annoying: cloaked in anonymity, many readers chide you for not citing their own work, suggest that you revise the article so that it focuses on their own pet projects, suggest that you revise the article so that it DOESN’T focus on their pet projects, suggest that you revise the article to say what it already says, etc.  And yet when I write something that is not peer-reviewed, I miss the cranky advice.  Am I a masochist?  Well, peer review does keep me a bit more, well, not more honest, but perhaps more aware that not everyone will accept my premises.

Here are a few reasons why the [journal of high regard]’s process is better than most: it is double blind, meaning that the reviewer does not know the identity of the author and the author does not know the identity of the reviewer; they try very hard to respond within six or eight weeks, while some journals will sit on a piece for a year for no good reason; they try to find appropriate reviewers; and they are at least trying to be open to more than one species of criticism.

[EDIT: I, Scott Eric Kaufman, shouldn’t have left the name of the journal my friend had submitted to in the original post, so I’ve removed it in Matt’s comments as well.]

Annoying peer reviews are one piece of the problem; the other piece are editors who are unable to decide which peer review to trust, and, as you say, “split the difference”. I think that’s the worse of the two problems, and accounts for why journal publication is often so grinding an ordeal and why articles are so slow to appear. Editors need to have confidence in their own judgement, and most of them don’t.

The problems with peer reviewing in the humanities are so deep-rooted and multifaceted that every incompetent or slipshod report probably has several causes. 

One is the sheer bulk of material that editors receive every month. With a book and several articles a requirement for promotion, aspiring professors flood the presses and journals with manuscripts. And because of the deadlines, they usually submit a work before it’s ready. The low quality of submissions (or, perhaps, one should say, their prematurity) fosters an impatience among editors and peer reviewers, which often comes out in overdone rejections.

Another problem lies in the dissensus of the field in epistemological matters. However much scientists dispute experimental results and engage in research fraud, they still share canons of evidence and inference. But in the humanities, what counts for some doesn’t count for others. One reader emphasizes familiarity with prior scholarship, another questions the validity of the arguments, another likes the theoretical premises, another wants more historical documentation, etc.

Still another problem has to do with audience. The sales of scholarly books now number in the low three figures. Presses used to count on 1000 guaranteed sales of cloth copies to libraries. Now, it’s around 300. Quarterlies find their individual subscribers number even less than that. Because of the pressure to publish, presses and journals have been looked at by academics as serving them, the contributors, not serving a readership. That could continue as long as the funding was secure. But university budgets are tightening, and decision-makers want to know why they are supporting a journal nobody reads. Editors have to ask an uncustomary question: How to boost circulation and sales? Apart from scholarly quality, what kinds of submissions will alleviate the pressure?

FWIW, this happens in some of the sciences as well.  The Journal of Theoretical Computer Science is a good example.  I’m not sure if this is because of a “backlog” of articles for review, though, or simply because the journal acts as a sort of archive (rather than a report) of results and research; a lot of the reportage goes on at conferences and through online distribution channels.

Oh, so it’s _normal_ for journals to sit on a piece indefinitely for no apparent reason.  [wipes brow]

This week I was delighted to finally have in my hands the published version of a paper I submitted more than six years ago. It doesn’t usually take quite as long as that, but some publications are notorious for sitting on things for ages. (I’d better not embarrass them publicly by naming names).

I can easily imagine reasons why a journal could suddenly clear a large backlog - e.g. a staff member returns from maternity leave and is more effective at chasing up tardy referees than her temporary replacement.

I agree with what you say about common faults in reviews. As an author, I find it rather annoying to get a review that suggests I should have written about the reviewer’s favorite subject instead. As a referee, I try to avoid dong this!

I am very much in favour of double-blind refereeing. It’s not universal, though. Recently, a conference where I was on the program committee decided to reveal the authors names to referees in order to be better able to detetct conflicts of interest. [I don’t buy this argument]

In spite of the faults, I think that double blind referee reports are a good thing. That said, I do like more editorial intervention than is ordinarily the case. When reports conflict, it is nice--as has occasionally happened to me--to have the editor him or herself weigh in with a “Don’t worry too much about crazy-reviewer’s insane hobbyhorse; but please do heed that same crazy person’s thoughts about section one. We think it’s muddy, too.” 

My favorite, however, was the receipt of two postcard from a very prestigious journal on the same day: one acknowledging receipt of the manuscript, the second, rejecting it.
