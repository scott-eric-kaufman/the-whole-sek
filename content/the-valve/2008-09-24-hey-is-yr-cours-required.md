This is the first generation of college students for whom familiarity with alternative modes of literacy may be essential to their success in the marketplace of ideas.  While the conventional definition of literacy still holds sway among educators and the old business elite, digital literacy—the very modes of communication disdained by the current arbiters of professional decorum—will confer upon the next generation of business executives a competitive advantage their forebears cannot even imagine.

so yeah like i said it may be competitionly to my advantages to focus maybe on digital thoughts instead a stringing words one after another to impres the likes of u?  i mean do u even care about yr rims.  whut u drive yo?
