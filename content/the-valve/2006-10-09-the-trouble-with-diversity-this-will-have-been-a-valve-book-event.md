Although posts on other topics will begin appearing now, [_The Trouble With Diversity_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/080507841X/diesekoschmar-20) event it not quite finished yet.  We still have a few contributors whose choked schedules have prevented them from participating.  Also, as noted previously, Walter Benn Michaels will be responding to the posts and comments in the coming weeks.    

But I wanted to take the opportunity to thank everyone who participated—contributors and commenters alike—before other posts pushed them down-screen, and to encourage you to continue posting and commenting as the mood strikes you.  (The event's formal close is no reason not to leave comments—or posts, for that matter—like the one [Kyler Kuehn](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the_trouble_with_diversity_alan_wolfe_with_all_due_respect/#11921) left this afternoon.)
