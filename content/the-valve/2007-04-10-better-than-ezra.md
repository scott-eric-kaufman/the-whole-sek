No, you won’t find—especially when he’s [reading his own work](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Pound.html).  Be warned, however, as he does do the police in different voices.  His reading of [Hugh Selwyn Mauberley](http://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/authors/Pound/1939/Pound-Ezra_04_EP-Ode-Pour-LElection-de-Son-Sepulchre_Harvard_1939.mp3) in 1939 sounds like his answer to [Joyce’s reading](http://www.finneganswake.org/joyce1.mp3) of _Finnegans Wake_, right down to the exaggerated (and, in Pound’s case, affected) Irish accent.  Listen to how Joyce reads the line “a man and his bride embraced between them” and tell me he doesn’t ham it up.  (You can try.  I won’t listen.)  The Joyce reading is from the ALP section of the _Wake_, and the text he reads is transcribed [here](http://www.finneganswake.org/joycereading.htm).

Finnegans Wake takes years of reading for sure. Cantos I’m not as familiar with, at all.
