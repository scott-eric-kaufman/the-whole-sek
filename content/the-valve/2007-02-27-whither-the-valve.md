## Whither the Valve?

Off discussing and/or composing posts about Very Important Literary Things:

*   Miriam’s writing an academic soap opera in five parts ([part one](http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the_little_professor/2007/02/all_my_alienate.html), [part two](http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the_little_professor/2007/02/all_my_alienate_1.html)).
*   Joseph’s writing about [_Buffy_, popular culture and sexuality](http://kugelmass.wordpress.com/2007/02/27/sexuality-pop-culture-and-magic-the-prelude-starring-buffy/).  As he says: “[This post] is the prelude to a larger blog project on sexuality and popular culture, tentatively scheduled to post this August.”  (Knowing Joseph, I don’t think that date an estimate.  You know, the way it would be were I to say: “Sure, sure, I’m planning to discuss it February next, so let’s table it for the moment.")
*   Scott (that would be me) is writing about [_Cerebus_, literary modernism and auteur theory](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/02/cerebus_and_mod.html), as a follow-up to some musings on the [the possibility of conservative literary criticism](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/02/more_on_the_pos.html).  (The comment thread at the latter link is particularly good, despite—or, more likely, because—I’ve hardly said a word.)

As to why we’re not discussing these matters here, well, I won’t speak for Miriam and Joe, but there are still some unspoken rules in literary studies—and we’re all violating them.  

Like bandits.

Yes, but do any of you have the guts to enter a little contest I just set up over at [Mostly Harmless](http://mlyhlss.blogspot.com/2007/02/blame-postmodernism.html)--who can write the best parody of Hilton Kramer blaming postmodernism for the Bush administration?

Unfortunately, the Nielsens for this parody seem to be low; it may have to go off the air :)

My excuse for not shouldering my share of the collective burden is flu, for a week now and ongoing.  Assuming I don’t die of it, I’ll be back Valving soon.

Got a giggle from me with your comment here alone, Miriam.  I liked the way you wrote yourself into the lot in episode 3.  What do those stupid Neilsens know that you don’t, anyway?
