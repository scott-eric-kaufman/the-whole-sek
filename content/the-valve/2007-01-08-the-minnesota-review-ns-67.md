From Michael Bérubé's linked interview:

"Williams: Is that why you're not a Marxist? 

Bérubé: Pretty much. But I'm still trying to work this out. I'm rereading The Hard Road to Renewal, partly because it's out of print and partly because many people who give Stuart Hall grief for working at too high a level of abstraction tend to forget how very much in the moment and very specific many of his writings are. But I have the same questions Hall asked about what's left of the Marxist project. Someone—Rich Puchalsky by name—appeared on the blog just yesterday saying that one of the reasons that the left I'm arguing against focuses on foreign policy is because it doesn't have any vision any longer about actually existing society. So it's much easier taking pot shots at US foreign policy because, god, US foreign policy is basically a reign of horror. I don't know anymore what the Marxist project entails. I do know that there's a common thread between conservatives—especially conservative media—and the far left: even though they hate liberals, basically they don't think that liberals really exist. Conservatives, when they go after "liberals," as Horowitz did, immediately go for the far left. They think Ward Churchill is a liberal; they conflate a guy like Ward Churchill with Tom Brokaw, for god's sake. At the same time, you find that the left thinks that liberals are really neoliberals, they're really about privatization and the dominance of markets in the end. Not that there isn't some truth to that."

This is such a perfect statement of views that I agree with that Bérubé might as well have been citing me—why, he did!  Re-quoted here for added Googleability in case the minnesota review page is temporary.

What, with SEK's citation of you at MLA--which got a big laugh--you're becoming famous, Rich, or at least everyone's favorite touchstone.
