As its [illustrious](http://crookedtimber.org/2006/08/31/open-university/) [competitors](http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/29581.html) for “Most Prestigious Group Blog” have noted, _The New Republic_‘s [Open University](http://www.tnr.com/blog/openuniversity) went online today.  The roster is nothing short of spectacular:

David A. Bell, David Bromwich, Daniel W. Drezner, David Greenberg, Jacob S. Hacker, Michael Kazin, Sanford Levinson, Jacob T. Levy, Darrin M. McMahon, John McWhorter, Elisa New, Steven Pinker, Eric Rauchway, Christine Stansell, Lawrence Summers, Cass R. Sunstein, Abigail Thernstrom, Ted Widmer and Alan Wolfe.

I’m not entirely sure what its establishment means for the future of academic blogging.  Does it bode well?  Does it mean academic bloggers have already “made it”?  How will these titans interact with established bloggers?  Will they participate in discussions or will they merely initiate them?  

Over the past three years, I’ve corresponded with four of its contributors; all four struck me as personable, charitable scholars willing to engage their opponents.  (A few months back, I heard Pinker was “stubborn, arrogant, uncooperative and chewed with his mouth open.”  That description—_sans_ flourish—didn’t jibe with my experience.)  What effect will having to deal with trolls, [sorrowful or otherwise](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/the_troll_of_co.html), have on them?  I’m as curious as I can be (without wishing it upon them).

Also, everyone should check out Eric Rauchway’s post on [_Deadwood_](http://www.tnr.com/blog/openuniversity?pid=35044).  In addition to being an exceptionally gifted historian—his [_Murdering McKinley: The Making of Theodore Roosevelt’s America_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0809016389/diesekoschmar-20) is one of the finest books on my period (Gilded Age/Progressive Era) I’ve read to date—he has impeccable taste in links.

It’s good to see Jacob T. Levy will be back in the blog world, beyond his occasional comments.

You can’t comment on new republic blogs unless you subscribe to the new republic.  That may get rid of trolls in a “baby with the bathwater” kind of way.   [This](http://www.tnr.com/blog/openuniversity?pid=35027) is a good post.

I will happily troll TNR-blog if a subscriber lends me his identity.
