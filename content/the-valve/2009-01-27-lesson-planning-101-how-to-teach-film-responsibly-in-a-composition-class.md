Lest you think I’m publishing a long introduction-to-film-studies-type scene analysis for no reason, I had a few English people ask me how I taught film after [I posted my syllabus](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/my/) last quarter.  So I thought as long as I’m prepping for Tuesday anyway, I might could help a few folk out.  I’m not an expert in film theory, so if you’re looking for something along those lines, I suggest you head over to [yonder blog](http://chutry.wordherders.net/wp/) and consult its illustrious roll.  But if you want a workmanlike approach to teaching basic film vocabulary in a composition class, you could do worse.  (Albeit not much.)

Because I’m one of those cultural studies loons who believe that popular means culturally significant, the film I’m teaching is _The Dark Knight_.  The scene I’ve tasked my students to analyze begins 1 hour and 24 minutes into the film.  (The link points off-site because I couldn’t coax _The Valve_ into posting those pictures correctly.)
