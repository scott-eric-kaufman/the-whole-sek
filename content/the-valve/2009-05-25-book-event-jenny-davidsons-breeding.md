Beginning tomorrow, _The Valve_ will be hosting a book event on [Jenny Davidson](http://jennydavidson.blogspot.com/)‘s [_Breeding: A Partial History of the Eighteenth Century_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0231138784/diesekoschmar-20).  Peter Gay has already reviewed the book for [Bookforum](http://www.bookforum.com/inprint/016_01/3519), which is rather remarkable when you consider this was an academic book published by a university press—then again, it’s a rather remarkable book.  

The introduction and first two chapters are [available online](http://books.google.com/books?id=7P4lD6wDhkUC&amp;dq=%!j(MISSING)enny+davidson%!+(MISSING)breeding&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ejqlCr4_Zn&amp;sig=uYvWsZv766WVKw84UKFVphBozDQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=q-4aSo6ZBor8swPX6KnBCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#PPT1,M1).
