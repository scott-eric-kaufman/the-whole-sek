Beginning tomorrow, _The Valve_ will be hosting a book event on [Jenny Davidson](http://jennydavidson.blogspot.com/)‘s [_Breeding: A Partial History of the Eighteenth Century_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0231138784/diesekoschmar-20).  Peter Gay has already reviewed the book for [Bookforum](http://www.bookforum.com/inprint/016_01/3519), which is rather remarkable when you consider this was an academic book published by a university press—then again, it's a rather remarkable book.  

The introduction and first two chapters are [available online](http://books.google.com/books?id=7P4lD6wDhkUC&dq=%22jenny+davidson%22+breeding&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=ejqlCr4_Zn&sig=uYvWsZv766WVKw84UKFVphBozDQ&hl=en&ei=q-4aSo6ZBor8swPX6KnBCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9#PPT1,M1).
