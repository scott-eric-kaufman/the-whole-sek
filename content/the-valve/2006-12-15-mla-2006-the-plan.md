Many of you will be attending the MLA in Philadelphia in a few weeks, and we here at The Internet would love to meet as many of you as we can.  "My" [panel on academic blogging](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/another_mla_pan.html) is Saturday at 8:30 a.m. in room 308 of the Philadelphia Marriott—a terrible time, yes, but _perfect_ for a brunch afterwards so long as too many people don't attend.  Thing is, I've heard word that too many people _will_ in fact attend, which means we ought to think about alternative arrangements.  Some of us will be heading to D.C. Saturday night for [UnfoggeDCon](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2006_11_26.html#005856).  Others have plans for early Friday evening, but maybe a later engagement could be arranged?  (After all, it _is_ Friday night.)   

Then there's Thursday night.  Many of you will already be around for Amardeep, Michael, Rita Felski and Jeffrey Williams' panel on "[Literary Studies in the Public Sphere](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/mla_2006/index.html)" (scroll down), which begins promptly at 12:00 p.m. in the Philadelphia Marriott's Liberty Ballroom Salon C.  

I'm merely throwing out ideas here.  Anyone who's interested (participants included) in attending some sort of blog-specific extra-curricular activity send me an email at scotterickaufman (at) gmail (dot) com.  Give us a general idea of your schedule and we'll try to accommodate as many people as is mathematically possible.

Scott, thanks for reminding me about the location of my panel! I have to admit I haven't even cracked open the program yet. 

I would vote for a meet up on Thursday evening.

I'll be in Philly, but I plan on being loudly drunk the entire time between Christ's birth and the New Year (my partner will be attending MLA for the both of us).  So I'm not sure when I'd be presentable to meet new people.  

Having lived in Philly for a long time, I can recommend good restaurants, bars, after-hours "social clubs," record shops, coffee joints, and places to pimp your rides.  Ask and you will receive.

Having better taste than Luther, I offer to recommend restaurants and coffeehouses as well.
