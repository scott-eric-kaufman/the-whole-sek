[Aaron](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/archive_author/abady/Aaron%!B(MISSING)ady) nabbed the [2008 Cliopatria Award](http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/20359.html#2008clios) for “Best Writer.”  I say “nabbed,” but in truth, he earned it—I wouldn’t have asked him to contribute if I didn’t think he’d land us swag.  Congratulations to Aaron and all the winners:

I second these SEK-y congrats.  Second them, I do.  Well done and well deserved Aaron; and welldone to Scott and his friends too for the group win.  Theirs is by far the best blog named after a U2 guitarist on _any_ subject, not just History.

Thanks you guys, but the real winner here is Aaron.  I mean, I coat-tailed my way on the backs of Established Historians, whereas he earned his way on the strength of his own prose.
