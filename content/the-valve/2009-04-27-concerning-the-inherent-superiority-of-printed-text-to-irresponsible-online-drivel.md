Is it absolutely necessary for the image gracing the cover of the most recent issue _of_ _the official mouthpiece of my professional organization_ to depict something that, when seen on my desk by a colleague from another department, compelled her to ask where [a viper fish would even get a detachable penis to whack off against a shrimp-wielding toucan](http://www.mlajournals.org/action/showLargeCover?issue=40002160)? Do other departments not laugh at us enough already?

Why does this same issue contain a write-up of a forum from _the 2007 MLA convention_? Did it really take two years and change to transform that panel into something print-worthy? So I take it the first sentence is _supposed_ to read:

In contributions to this 2007 panel of the division on Comparative Studies in Romanticism and the Nineteenth Century, titled "Untiming the Nineteenth-Century: Temporality and Periodization," periodization, a venerable mainstay of comparative _**literarature**_ safeguarded by its apparent neutrality, is critically arraigned.

Lest you think I'm mocking the author of this sentence, Emily Apter, let me make this absolutely clear: Apter's introduction is lively and interesting—historicists like myself tend to be interested in arguments about or against periodization even when we disagree with them—but how well is her intellectual project _of two years previous_ served by appearing so belatedly? How well is her intellectual integrity represented by an error so basic only a typesetter could have made it?  _These_ are the standards against which necessarily inconsequential (because) online conversations should be judged?  

Maybe I'm still [in a foul mood](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/la-noche-oscura-del-seno-frontal.html), but I don't think so.
