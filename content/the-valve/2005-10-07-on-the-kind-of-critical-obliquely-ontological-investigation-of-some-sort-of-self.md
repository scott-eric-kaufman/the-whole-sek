Two long posts, both concerning theory, both beginning with a quotation of a previous discussion.Â  Serendipity?Â  The constitutional inability to resist having the last word?Â  Doesnâ€™t matter.Â  Also unimportant: the experiment I concocted whereby I would post this here and ask Mark to post it on [Long Sunday](http://www.long-sunday.net) to see whether the two crowds would treat the material differently in some meaningful way.Â  But I digress.Â  (Despite not even having started yet.)  Ahem: [I accused](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/political_spirituality/#4230) Mark Kaplan of reading [Foucaultâ€™s account of historical interest](http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2005/06/foucault_and_ir.html) naively.Â  I quoted this bit as proof:

So, for example, the sexual practices of ancient Greece â€“ were these not, for Foucault, partly a way of thinking his way outside modern notions of â€˜sexualityâ€™ and the historically ingrained â€˜regimeâ€™ supporting them.

And followed with this assessment:

I think Markâ€™s severely underestimating Foucaultâ€™s congenital pessimism, both about historical change and, more importantly, the idea that we can understand the discourses which saturate our lives in the moment that we live them.

He responded, quite rightly, that I glossed over Foucaultâ€™s notion of â€œthe critical ontology of the self,â€ the practice he (Foucault) identifies with Kantâ€™s _AufklÃ¤rung_, which my _Oxford Duden German Dictionary_ tells me means something along the lines of â€œclearing up,â€ â€œsolution,â€ â€œelucidation,â€ â€œexplanation,â€ â€œa reconnaissance planeâ€ or â€œthe Enlightentment.â€  Some of these things are not like the others.Â  Iâ€™ve wondered why the English translation of the essayâ€”"What is Enlightenment?"â€”failed to capture the reference there both in Kantâ€™s German ("_Was ist AufklÃ¤rung?_â€œ) and Foucaultâ€™s French ("_Quâ€™est-ce que les LumiÃ¨res?_â€œ).Â  Might this slight tic in the English be indicative of some abstractive impulse at the heart of Anglo-American Theory?Â  (Yes, I _capitalized_ it, but for reasons which will eventually become apparent.)  Iâ€™m not too inclined (yet) to attribute such a thing to American Theory because Kantâ€™s work, as well as Foucaultâ€™s gloss of it, speaks directly to the problem of philosophical thought reflecting on the present moment:

I have been seeking, on the one hand, to emphasize the extent to which a type of philosophical interrogationâ€”one that simultaneously problematizes manâ€™s relation to the present, manâ€™s historical mode of being, and the constitution of the self as an autonomous subjectâ€”is rooted in the Enlightenment. On the other hand, I have been seeking to stress that the thread that may connect us with the Enlightenment is not faithfulness to doctrinal elements, but rather the permanent reactivation of an attitudeâ€”that is, of a philosophical ethos that could be described as a permanent critique of our historical era.

This permanent critique of our historical era should entail â€œthe analysis of ourselves as beings who are historically determined, _to a certain extent_, by the Enlightenmentâ€ and â€œâ€˜the contemporary limits of the necessary,â€™â€ _i.e._ â€œwhat is _not or is no longer_ indispensible for the constitution of ourselves as autonomous subjects.â€  All that emphasis are belong to us.Â  We, er, Iâ€™ve empahsized those passages not because Iâ€™m being excessively pedantic about hedging key philosophical claims: Iâ€™ve emphasized them because in the process of declaring the need for a new philosophical project Foucault qualifies away the most contested elements of his early thought: the extent to which any _individual_ discourse factors into the formation of autonomous subjects.Â  Iâ€™ll return to this momentarily, but first let me touch on his distinction between â€œthe Enlightenmentâ€ and â€œHumanism.â€

The first is a complex historical event.Â  The second is the â€œ_theme or set of themes_ that have reappeared on several occasions over time in European societies; these themes, always tied to value judgments, have obviously _varied greatly in their content as well as in the values they have preserved_.â€  Again, Foucault qualifies at the very moment his argument demands clarification.Â  (Or a reconnaisance plane.)  Humanism sounds like a Foucauldian discoure: it is both Christian _and_ opposes Christianity; hostile and critical towards scientific inquiry _and_ supportive and optimistic of it.Â  Humanism has been present, he argues by dint of list, in Marxism, existentialism, personalism, National Socialism and Stalinism.Â  And the Enlightenment, of course.Â  But even though he easily identifies all the places in which it has been present, he lists none of its definitive characteristics, none of the ways in which it informed any of these larger movements in which it was a â€œtheme or set of themes.â€  _Not even in the Enlightenment:_ â€œAn analysis of their complex relations in the course of the last two centuries would be a worthwhile project an important one if we are to bring _some measure_ of clarity to the consciousness that we have of ourselves and of our past.â€

Foucaultâ€™s assertions here align perfectly with Markâ€™s claim about it: at this late stage of his career, Foucaultâ€™s invested in a â€œcritical ontology of the selfâ€ which will â€œnot seek to identify the universal structures of all knowledge or of all possible moral action, but will seek to treat the instances of discourse that articulate what we think, say, and do as so many historical events.â€  This project applies the â€œarcheologicalâ€ method Foucault earlier established to what Iâ€™ll call â€œthe historical present.â€  Are there limits to our ability to assess the historical present the same way we assess the historical past?Â  Of course there are: â€œThis philosophical ethos may be characterized as a limit-attitude.â€  The inability of an individual to identify precisely the discourses of which he or she is constituted would put a damper on this whole endeavour.Â  But Foucault anticipates this criticism (born, as it is, from his own thought):

To this, two responses. It is true that we have to give up hope of ever acceding to a point of view that could give us access to any complete and definitive knowledge of what may constitute our historical limits. And from this point of view the theoretical and practical experience that we have of our limits and of _the possibility of moving beyond them_ is _always limited and determined_; thus we are always in the position of beginning again.

Here again Foucault the Elder tries to buck Foucault the Younger, claiming that the best we can muster is an infinite â€œbeginning again.â€  We cannot transcend our limits, or even ever be fully cognizant of them.Â  Therefore, even if we try to transcend them, not only would we never be entirely sure what it is weâ€™d be trying to transcend; weâ€™d be damn sure (according to Foucault) that we wouldnâ€™t be able to do anything even if we did.Â  Foucault the Younger understands the implications of his own thoughts.Â  Foucault the Elder plasters over these pessimisms by saying, â€œWell, we should have this limit-attitude, yes, and we should be aware of the futility of our project, alright, and if we do this we can overcome what it is I just now said we can never overcome, understand?â€  (In this vein I understand his attraction to _Anti-Oedipus:_ Deleuze &amp; Guattari explode the piÃ±ata and admire the falling confetti and, um, then theyâ€™re all liberated, see?)  In other words, the way I read Foucault the Elder has been determined by my understanding of Foucault the Younger.Â  

But before I proceedâ€”Johnâ€™s an inspirationâ€”I need you to know there are a few things Iâ€™m absolutely, positively not doing: first, Iâ€™m not denigrating Foucaultâ€™s life-long commitment to the ideals of leftist intellectual dissidents, nor am I suggesting that his public political commitments were in any way insincere; second, Iâ€™m not saying that Foucault didnâ€™t believe there to be an integral relation between his scholarship and â€œthe real worldâ€ or what-not, as anyone who has glanced as his bibliographyâ€”_Madness and Civilization_, _Pierre Riviere_, _The Birth of the Clinic_, and _Discipline and Punish_ were nothing if not the work of a scholar with a social conscience and a deeply ingrained desire not to speak to it.Â  That said, the implications of his own work point to the futility of such interventions, _especially political ones_.Â  Iâ€™ll post â€œPart IIâ€ of this as soon as I write it.Â  It will outline why Foucault the Younger wouldâ€™ve laughed at Foucault the Elder and discuss how one particular group of scholars, the self-proclaimed New Historicists, sought to overcome the deterministic bent of Foucauldian thought.Â  

**Addendum #1**

Lest the contradiction I address be buried beneath the endless torrent of prose I produced, I should add: I think Foucault knows that he canâ€™t be correct on both fronts.Â  Either his work on discourse accurately accounts for the means by which autonomous individuals are created _or_ his assertions here to the effect that approaching without transcending the limited knowledge about how the discourses active in the historical present have constituted us as autonomous individuals is correct.Â  Both canâ€™t be.Â  Although I have problems with both, I think the former a much stronger case than the latter (in large part because it lacks the desperation of the wishful thinker permeating the other).

**Infinitely Editable Coda**

This may be a bat-shit account of Foucault.Â  If it is, call me out on it.Â  Iâ€™ve only ever read him for my own edification, so thereâ€™s a chance I might be coloring outside the lines.Â  Second: I reserve the right to edit this up the Great Chain if it is bat-shit.Â  Who knows which higher mammal itâ€™ll be come morn.Â  Stay tuned!

Contra Harpham, itâ€™s worth noting that _Reflexive Water_ (?) has been in print since the beginning of time.

Not â€œin print,â€ exactly, but printed, I mean.

I didnâ€™t invent the wheel, but I do use one on occasion.

I read the Aufklaerung paragraph twice and still couldnâ€™t figure out what your point was.

I thought that second paragraph pretty straightforward: Kant and Foucault (in the French) were clearly talking about the historical entity called â€œThe Enlightenment.â€  The English title, however, makes it sound like Foucaultâ€™s talking about an abstract quality called â€œEnlightenment.â€  A pot-shot at a tendency of Anglo-American theory, that was.

Not bat-shit.Â  Dead-on.Â  Itâ€™s a last work and full of ambivalence.Â  But like almost all his work, it paints matters in such extreme terms (the implication that without complete and definitive knowledge of our historical limits, autonomy is fatally compromised) that itâ€™s not clear that you can go anywhere with that ambivalence.

_the experiment I concocted whereby I would post this here and ask Mark to post it on Long Sunday to see whether the two crowds would treat the material differently in some meaningful way._

Interesting experiment.Â  So what do people think so far?

I count 19 comments over there, many of them substantive (and a few on pas au-delà as well).

Wallace, you're certainly correct, though of those, Iâ€™d only count six (not including my own) as substantive.Â  Discard the casual one liners, the quotations sans explanations and you're left with Matt, CR, and some anonymice (presumably the same person, but who knows).Â  That said, LS still wins hands down at this point?Â  I have theories as to why, and to be frank, I expected this outcome...and I'll explain them all when I've had a little more sleep.Â  (All but four of the past seventy-two hours have been spent awake.Â  Why?Â  _I don't know.Â  If I did I'd be asleep._)

Itâ€™s taken me a while to catch up, but I agreeâ€”LS comment threads beat Valve comment threads.

You get sleep, I meet my deadline, and maybe we can compare notes.
