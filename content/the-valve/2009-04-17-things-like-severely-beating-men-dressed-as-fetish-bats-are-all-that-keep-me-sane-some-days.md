I received an email in response to [this comment](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/academic_respectability_comics_and_criticism/#24721) on John’s [latest post](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/academic_respectability_comics_and_criticism/), but because my explanation required images, I decided to throw it online; however, because it contained _so many_ images, it would take me hours to reformat it to display properly over here.  So if you’re interested in how I teach a subject dear to my heart (historical context) in a rhetorical vein via a single funny book (Warren Ellis’s [_Planetary/Batman: Night on Earth_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000JFCZNG/diesekoschmar-20)), you can [do so here](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/teaching-rhetoric-via-warren-ellis-planetary-batman-night-on-earth.html).

(_Title taken from the book.  Be glad I didn’t go with [an alternative](http://www.warrenellis.com/index.php?p=767)._)
