## So What Would You Ask Bono?

When I decided to participate in the Roth symposium (my submission to which is still forthcoming) Ray suggested I contact The Man (Mr. Roth) himself to see if he wanted to participate.  I did.  I reached his publicist.  He sent me a polite email explaining that Mr. Roth was hard at work on his next novel, but that he wished me and "my" symposium the best.  Later that week (on a lark) I decided to inflate my credentials and contact other celebrities.  One of the bands whose publicists I contacted was U2.  

Today.

I.

Heard.

Back.

Their publicist wants to arrange 15 minutes sometime next week to talk to Bono.  _Bono who may someday win the Nobel Peace Prize._ Since this ball seems to be rolling and I don't want to be revealed the liar I so patently am, if you have a good question to ask him I'd appreciate it if you said it now.  Because I don't think I can back down.  Damn it.  Me and my pretensions.

EDIT!  Re-reading the email, I realize that I've been offered 15 minutes with _one_ of Bono's _publicists_.  (No doubt there are hoards of them.)  I knew those gates were locked tighter than that.

Do a bit of research, first: read as many recent interviews with him as you can find.

Ask him about his view on the relationship between art and politics. [Pretty general, I know.]

gzombie, you're right that that is far too general.

What's interesting about Bono is that he represents the failure of the world order, and the consequent entrepeneurialization of aid.  In a sane world system you'd have some method by which rich countries would want to and could reliably help poor countries through some means which is understood to work, implemented through some classic form of organization.  But you don't, and therefore you have random rich people buying themselves a foreign policy.  You know: Gates curing diseases, Soros supporting all of the literature of Eastern Europe, Bono having a chance of actually winning a Nobel peace prize.

So the specifics of how Bono sees his role would be very interesting, insofar as they haven't been addressed yet.  He's already more involved in policy than the typical rock star, who shows up, uses his notoriety to raise money, and vanishes.  Has he been tempted to build his own organization?  How much emphasis does he put on general explanatory theories (i.e. "it's all capitalism's fault", "you can't solve the problem of corrupt governments from outside", etc.)?  Does he think that greater emphasis on promoting African artists and therefore giving them greater visibility as advocates and fundraisers in their own right would work?  Which initiatives does he think that the nonprofit sector is doing well with currently?

Um, no, that's not what I said.

As someone with a lot of experience interviewing rock musicians, I can tell you that the general question is likely to elicit the better response than the overly specific.

That said, Rich makes some very good suggestions.

Rich - Bono already has setup his own organization: www.data.org.

As far as the "general explanatory theories", he has proven himself to be very, very familiar with the nuances of the issue as seen from both/all sides of the political spectrum.

Re: general vs specific -- I dare say that no matter what questions are asked, in a 15-minute window all he's likely to offer in reply is some of the standard lines he's been saying for years. It's only when he does lengthy sit-downs (Charlie Rose, BBC, even Oprah) that you tend to get beyond the well-worn phrases. And I say that as a loooongtime fan.....

BTW, Scott -- I manage atu2.com and would be willing to help if you're seriously looking for question suggestions. :-) Use the email address on the NEWS page. Good luck with it!

As the "EDIT!" indicates, my mid-afternoon delusions of importance were, in the end, delusions.  Apparently there's a "sophisticated" vetting process which I, no doubt, will fail to move through.

www.data.org is interesting; it's far more of a classic lobby/membership group than what Gates or Soros has.  They have people who actually carry out policy -- minions, basically.  

I agree that you're not going to get much out of a 15 minute interview with a publicist, but you might as well try to ask something unusual and specific rather than draw out the usual generalities.  Maybe something based on gzombie's question about art and politics might be good after all, if it wasn't the publicist you were talking to.  Perhaps something about what arts academia can do, specifically.
