*   "It was only [then](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/07/first-ever-acep.html), on the night before we shipped out to Iraq, as I
reviewed my troops that I would be leading into battle, that I began to
have doubts about the declining standards of the National Guard. Yes,
we hit the enrollment targets, sure. But with what sort of men? A guy
so inordinately proud of his chest bush that he refused to wear his
fatigues, an ape from the San Diego zoo, a Star Wars nut who was scared
to appear in public without his R2D2 getup, and an illegal Mexican
wrestler who went by 'el vaquero secreto'? It was, in short, the moment
when I should have known that _les jeux sont faits_. We were well and
truly fucked." [via [CR](http://adswithoutproducts.typepad.com/)]
