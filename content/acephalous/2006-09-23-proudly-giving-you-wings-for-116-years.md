Were I not an historicist who knows tone shold always be contextalized, my mid-morning coffee and this passage from F. Savary Pearce's "A Clinical Report on the se of Testiclar Flid Injections" (1896) wold've been the death of my keyboard:
[B.S. injections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles-%!C(MISSING)3%!d(MISSING)ouard\_Brown-S%!C(MISSING)3%!A(MISSING)9quard)\* made him feel stronger and checked his rolling gait.  At the end of twelve days, the marked beneficial action obtained.  At this time a violent syphilitic explosion occurred and a roseolar rash appeared with absolutely complete [alopecia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia).

\* "B.S. injection" both totally does and most certainly does not mean what you think it does.
