## This Is Officially Ridiculous; or, Rita and The Perpetual Train

Three weeks ago some of my family evacuated to Houston to dodge [Katrina](http://technorati.com/tag/Katrina).  Today I hear from my family in Houston that they're evacuating to Baton Rouge to dodge [Rita](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/21/AR2005092100297.html).  (But it's about time for another [Storm of the Century](http://technorati.com/tag/Rita), now that we're finished dealing with the [political](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/20/AR2005092001704.html), [structural](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/20/AR2005092001894.html) and [emotional](http://technorati.com/search/katrina) fallout from Katrina.[[1]](#1))  At least this time all the politicos understand that their careers are on the line, so the people of [Galveston](http://technorati.com/tag/Galveston) (which has seen its fair share of [powerful hurricanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston\_Hurricane\_of\_1900) before) have already begun evacuating the [barrier island](http://maps.google.com/maps?oi=map&q=Galveston,+TX) off the [single road](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Galveston,+TX&ll=29.295981,-94.884367&spn=0.055253,0.113666&hl=en) connecting it to the mainland.  (When will the calls to permanently abandon [Galveston](http://blogcritics.org/archives/2005/09/12/192648.php) begin?  How long before Dennis Hastert pens some inflammatory, inappropriate and insensitive remarks?  Galveston, after all, doesn't front the planet's [fourth busiest port complex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port\_of\_South\_Louisiana).)  

At this point I'm almost tempted to say that the entire South should be reconfigured along the lines of "the perpetual train" in China Mieville's [_Iron Council_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345464028/).   Put the whole region on rails.  Instead of evacuating the people, whenever [the latest Storm of the Century](http://technorati.com/tag/%!h(MISSING)urricane+rita%!#(MISSING)taglink) barrels down on some Southern coastline the South can pick up its skirts, lay down its rails and _evacuate itself_.  (Given his [impressive breakdown](http://leninology.blogspot.com/2005/08/politics-of-weather.html) of the failure of the federal, state and local governments to respond to Katrina I wonder why he hasn't beat me to the punch.)  

Ugh.  I thought I was finished with this particular panic attack for the 2005 Hurricane Season.  

[[1]]() Because the [history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_Orleans%!C(MISSING)\_Louisiana) of [New Orleans](http://technorati.com/tag/New Orleans) (according to Wikipedia) is no longer subdivided into "Colonial Era," "19th Century," "20th Century" and "Hurricane Katrina."

We're in the up part of a multidecadal hurricane cycle.  In addition, anthropogenic global climate change makes Gulf surface waters warmer, adding to the strength of the hurricanes that occur (though probably not adding to their frequency).

"Storms of the Century" are going to be relatively common.  As Bruce Sterling wrote recently with respect to global climate change, "You are going to run out of denial before the world runs out of storms."

I work with this kind of thing, tangentially.  Here is one of [the last projects](http://www.ombwatch.org/article/articleview/3088) that I worked on, if anyone cares.

Rita has morphed in the past 24 hours from a tropical storm to a Category 4 hurricane .. and is expected to swell into a Category 5 later today as it barrels across the warm, energizing Gulf of Mexico. It remains aimed at Texas' mid-coast, but moments ago Texas Gov. Rick Perry called for the voluntary evacuation of coastal areas from Beaumont to Corpus Christi; our own county and municipal authorities have also called for voluntary evacuation, with the option to make it mandatory in the next 24 hours.

Our protector at the moment is a high-pressure cell that's acting as a shield, driving Rita more southerly. If the high-pressure system passes through too quickly, our shield disappears and Rita can detour sharply north toward the Texas-Louisiana line ... us. Our best-case scenario, it seems, is that we'll endure Rita's outer bands of tropical storm-force winds and rain; worst-case is that she turns directly at us.

Relentless Rita churns ahead. One hurricane guru called the devastating difference between a Category 4 and 5 as the difference between being run over by an 18-wheeler or a freight train. One might be slightly less powerful than the other, but either way you're gonna have a really bad day.

The scenario we face now, to extend the analogy, is a freight train heading at you with a 400-mile running start.

Gas stations in some surrounding communities have already sold out. I saw long lines at bank ATMs this morning. If you're looking for a small generator, plywood to board your windows, lumber to buttress your home or other structures, bottled water, a hotel room within 100 miles ... you're already out of luck here.

The mood around the newsroom is a slightly more nervous than yesterday, but certainly not disabling. We've begun to see how our focus might shift from our traditional paper-newspaper to our web site as a way to keep generating fresh, relevant news for readers who aren't here -- both local evacuees and curious outlanders who want to see what we're seeing. Our preparations are a mix of journalistic forethinking, gut reaction, and planning for the safety and comfort of our people who stay. We discuss how to power computers in a blackout, keys to the company snack bar, porta-johns in the warehouse, flexible and dynamic graphics that can be adjusted at the latest moment, who must stay and who can go ... if nothing else, we get a crash course -- on a very small scale -- of the difficulty of responding wisely, quickly and perfectly to a storm that could change course in the next hour and hit anywhere within about 500 miles.

Perhaps FEMA should be smarter about such things than a bunch of Texas newspaper wretches, but until you're casually chatting about life and death in the maw of a killer hurricane, you don't really understand how the processes become more urgent, confusing and haphazard. Many questions go unasked, leaving holes in our foresight and uneasy feelings.
