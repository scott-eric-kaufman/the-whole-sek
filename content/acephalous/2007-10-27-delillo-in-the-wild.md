## DeLillo in the Wild

[VA](http://sbttp.blogspot.com/) spots the rare, [wild DeLillo](http://sbttp.blogspot.com/2007/10/is-scott-boras-delillo-character.html) in Ben McGrath's [profile](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/10/29/071029fa\_fact\_mcgrath) of noted extortionist [Scott Boras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott\_Boras):

*   Being Catholic, who you are as a person, you don’t appreciate any association with Satan.
*   Philosophically, in areas that I can’t talk about, we were on different pages.
*   This was the day, was it not, for influential men to come to sudden messy ends.
*   People
call me from the outside world all the time—they want me to negotiate
everything. I’m not the person who will go out and negotiate anything,
at any time, for anyone who happens to wear some sort of uniform.
*   People
don’t go to the Super Bowl for the game. Most Super Bowl games are not
competitive, or good games. They go there for the event. They go there
for the three-day weekend.
*   The game doesn't change the way you sleep or wash your face or chew your food. It changes nothing but your life.
*   I
looked at the producer and I go, "Who in their right mind would ever do
such a thing, to disclose the intimate negotiations between you, the
people you deal with every day, the teams, and everything?"
*   Computers
will die. They're dying in their present form. They're just about dead
as distinct units. A box, a screen, a keyboard. They're melting into
the texture of everyday life. Even the word computer.

[Someone](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/don\_delillo\_pil.html) almost feels vindicated: Boras sounds as bland—as Wonder Bread—as your typical DeLillo character and/or narrator, _i.e._ he represents all that is banal and evil in contemporary literature.  (Full disclosure: the bit about James Wood in that link is a _tad_ ironic now, [all things considered](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/dear-good-sense.html).)  I wonder whether the fault lies not with Boras, but with McGrath.  Boras might could be a run-of-the-mill agent whose rambling lectures were edited into DeLillo-speak by one of _The New Yorkers_' infamous dictators—but why would anyone do that?  What would the benefit be?  But there's another possibility:

Given his legendary powers of salesmanship, perhaps Boras doesn't speak DiLillo-ese—perhaps he learned it for the exclusive purpose of sounding like someone being profiled in _The New Yorker_.  No one _actually_ sounds like that, of course, but Boras wouldn't know that.  He'd push the hard-line and become the first person _outside_ a DeLillo novel to speak like someone _inside_ one.  That would be some feat.  

Relatedly: this seems an opportune moment to play a round of [Spot-the-DeLillo](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/don\_delillo\_pil.html#comment-10715075):

*   Ask the weasel why he did it, boys.
*   I punished myself by going for long underwater swims in the
artifical lake, coming up gasping, the sky regarding me through misty
spectacles, quire curiously.
*   A man showed her his mutilated arm and asked for change.
*   Milk is the subtlest of insults.
*   Paper streamers came out of our eyes.

As [Jonathan](http://jgoodwin.net/) noted, one of these things is not like the other.  Care to guess?  ([Answer](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/don\_delillo\_pil.html#comment-10715793).)

I blame McGrath.  (Not for the irruption of fsdagg, but for the DeLilloisms.)  As people have been commenting over on Unfogged tonight, with reference to a "Modern Love" column in the Times, quotations in journalism aren't really quotations.  They're edited, with an eye or ear for effect....

SEK,

Timely post in light of Rodriguez opting out of his contract after---was it 1 second after---the end of the World Series.

I wonder if Boras is Rodriguez's heterosexual male life partner?

Vance, they certainly are ... but one of the things I always taught my students was that it was important to capture the voice of the subject.  This is more a case of "distillation" than "invention" or "conformation to a well-noted author's prose style."  I'll read that Unfogged thread and get back to you.

Tim, I swear Boras was in a room with 18 lackeys, and that before Papelbon's glove hit the ground, they'd 1) opted-out, 2) contacted the Angels, Dodgers, Mets, Tigers, &c. and 3) consoled Alex on yet another October in which he had to watch the team he refused to go to frolic on the field.

I don't mean that McGrath decided to make Boras sound like something out of DeLillo.  But distillation, in this context, certainly means "conformation to a ... style", and one imagines McGrath gets his sense of style from many sources.
