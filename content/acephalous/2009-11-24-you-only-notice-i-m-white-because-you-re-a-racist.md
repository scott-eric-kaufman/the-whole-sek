## You only notice I'm white <em>because you're a racist</em>.

In the comments to a long, inaccurate [attack](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15553) on those who consider Palin evidence that the conservative movement is trending stupid, Darleen Click [claims](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15553#comment-818905)
that those who point out the extreme whiteness of Palin supporters
"reveal a great more about [themselves] than Palin." Because such
people notice race at all, they're insufficiently colorblind and
therefore more racist than Click, who merely advocates creating and
maintaining structural inequalities that disproportionately affect
people who just happen to not be white.   

Set aside for a moment
the fact that Click labors under the delusion that noticing people of
color is more racist than harming them and remember that 1) the figure
she defends, Sarah Palin, is using her publicity tour as a prelude to a
2012 presidential bid launch, and 2) candidate Palin is posting
photographs of the people she meets on [her Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/notes/sarah-palin/going-rogue-tour/178313593434),
meaning that these are not images produced by a liberal media elite out
to make her look like her appeal is limited to white people 
but images she and her people have decided should represent her mass-appeal on a mock-presidential bid launch
. Time to play "Count the Non-White People"!

In all those photographs, there is 
one non-white person 
who
can be positively identified as having come of their own accord. To
Click, pointing out that Palin's own handlers consider her appeal
limited to white people makes me a racist. Over in the increasingly
diverse place known as the United States, this is why people like Click
should hunker down for a long run of political disappointment.

Update. 
One of Darleen's flock [attempts to prove me wrong 
by being racist

Good job pointing out the fact that black people don't go to book signings.  What's your next trick?  Are you going to blow the lid off Amish bathing habits?

I absolutely love that you're using your racism to call me a racist.  (And yet, your stupid makes me a little sad.)

Hi Mr. SEK. Happy Thanksgiving! I don't think it's a Truth that the Sarah one is using her book tour "as a prelude to a 2012 presidential bid launch" and all. Nobody in her situation would explicitly close that door until after the book tour. There's just certain ways you do this sort of book tour thing I think. But there's no reason to think she's gonna run for president. I think running for president would show a startling lack of imagination on her part, actually, and plus also it's simply not a good idea.

Also I really don't think Darleen is all about the creating and the maintaining of the structural blah blah blah. I think mostly she just likes the Sarah Palin and thinks the Sarah hasn't gotten a fair shake. There's a lot of truth to that, really, but I don't really expect better in this little country anymore. It's a good thing though that there are Darleens what do. It's hopeful.

I especially liked the last paragraph where Darleen says that, if you use the word "teabagger", you don't believe in "American Constitutional principles".

Also I don't think there are just a heck of a lot of the minority peoples what really like the Sarah one just a whole lot, so it's not really surprising that they're not in the pictures, if you really think about it. You probably have to sort of zoom around with your camera to make sure you get minority ones in the shot at a Hannah Montana concert too, and Hannah Montana isn't particularly political really. Hannah M. invited the little president man's kids to be on her show, and they've been to her concert several times I think and had a good time even if it wasn't really a very down with the struggle thing to do.

I think it's better not to racialize these sort of celebrity run-in situations unless you have some really compelling point to make.

That's sort of a bringing of your own biases to the situation I think. I can't really think of how it is one could say that the Sarah Palin one built her career like that, distinguishing people like how you say. Whatever the Sarah one might be I don't at all think she's motivated by racisms. There's just a whole lot more to things than racism. I think people forget that.

I can think of two African American kids who are Hannah Montana fans, but their mean parents wouldn't let them visit the set when invited. Had to settle for the Jonas bros stopping by.

Palin tells lilly-white crowdes in North Carolina that they're their the real, pro-America Americans and that whoever they have in mind when they think of Obama supporters aren't, _because of my biases._

That's not racist though that's just a point of view, really. John Kerry got the same treatment, remember - he was painted as a rather french sort of homo person. A ponce what was out of step with Real America. Honestly you can read way too much into this sort of thing I think. Sometimes it seems like liberals are just offended by the dynamics of a campaign where there's inescapably two sides to an issue. It really seems to unnerve them kind of. Remember that [ABC memo](http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001123.php)?

Palin's behavior is unobjectionable because it is hallowed by precedent from Bush.

It doesn't matter who is supporting Palin and who isn't.  The supreme court is composed of 6 catholics out of 9 justices.  Whomever runs, the court will see that a catholic is President.  All of you protestants and jews and mormons are just wasting you time.

Notice how some bishop told the Kennedy representative to toe the catholic line on abortion or be cut off from the symbols of catholicism.

Got a feeling a lot of non Catholic churches are soon going to find themselves taxable.  The cost of medical care will continue to go up with the 600 plus catholic hospitals operating totally tax free.

You all are wasting your time even dreaming that anyone but a catholic will be a president.  Hell, they'll probably drag poor old Clarance Thomas out to be vice president since he is a catholic.

Luckily, the nefarious Vatican instructions arrived 10 minutes too late last November, thwarting their scheme.

_You all are wasting your time even dreaming that anyone but a catholic will be a president._ 

Well, the Catholics have had a near lock on the Presidency since the founding of the Republic.

Oh, and don't lose sight of the point of this post.  It's not about Palin's feelings on race.  Hell, has she ever expressed any? 

It's about the right wing teabaggers like Darleen and Happyfeet, who are hypocrites and racists.  Does Goldstein know what that simpleton's doing to his site?
