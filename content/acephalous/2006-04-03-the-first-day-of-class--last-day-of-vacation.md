## The First Day of Class & Last Day of "Vacation"

I pre-season this post with an unnecessary—given the new sidebar item top-right—admission that "[My Morning](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my\_morning.html)" didn't win a Koufax Award.  To be frank: I like [the  image of the probable _kvitcherer_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/koufax2.jpg) I created better than any shot of the smooth Koufaxian delivery of Evelyn Lichtenstein's _menscheleh._ (_On purpose_, people, _on purpose_.  C'mon!  I ain't _that_ lapsed.  What?  You!  In the peanut gallery.  _Yeah_ you.  That's right.  I _did_ hear.  Now shut it!  Don't make me take off this belt.)  

I open by acknowledging that this quarter will be the last I ever teach literary journalism.  I won't be hired to teach it . . . and UC requires I stop teaching after I teach, um, as many quarters as I've taught at UCI.  This saddens me.  I'd like to keep teaching this course indefinitely.  Jonathan once accused all teachers of deluding themselves into thinking they're both well-liked and tough graders.  He's surely correct.  Only not so much in my case.  In the past three weeks I've learned that four of my former students will be attending the prestigious Columbia School of Journalism.  Another two will enter the equally elite Northwestern School of Journalism.  I know what you're saying: "Scott, if you've been teaching literary journalism so long that you're placing your kids in graduate programs, it's time to move on."  

And it is.

But that doesn't mean I have to be happy about it.  

On a different note entirely, I'd hoped the "Best Introduction To" post would've gone viral already.  Alas!  It seems to affect only Americanists, Medievalists and Theory buffs.  I solicited some links for it yesterday and that seems to be doing the trick.  (Check out [this conversation](http://newkidonthehallway.typepad.com/new\_kid\_on\_the\_hallway/2006/04/medieval\_lit\_pe.html#comments) for instance.)  I think there's something to what [Craig](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/temporary\_comme.html#comment-15699376) and [Matt](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/temporary\_comme.html#comment-15751487) and [Laura](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/temporary\_comme.html#comment-15761241) argue in the comments; but I also think there's something to be said for an introductory text which allows someone with little more than interest to acquire something resembling knowledge.  I would love someone to pick up the baton and run with it.  In particular, I'm still sorely lacking in all things pre-Revolutionary American but _not_ Medieval.  This includes all things Analytic and Philosophical . . . some Existential stuff . . . and a whole slew of traditions based on the outlandish idea that it's acceptable to write in languages other than English.  As if.

Something tells me these 6 kids were never students who knew you as a "tough grader," Scott. And so the fact that they like you (if I'm reading the implied logic correctly) may not indicate that _all_ of your students liked you in spite of your tough grading. I wonder if you've compared your evaluations with grades given?

I've certainly noticed the correlation: the better the grades, the better my evals. (Of course, I'd like to think that the grades entirely reflected students' increased engagement with the class -- and that their liking me better followed reasonably from their being more interested in the material. But that, too, is probably more or less delusion.)

Anyway, happy first day to you weird quarter people.

You infer what I implied correctly: I've uniformly high evalutions (although I'm not [universally loved](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=254703)).  I do think the students in question would consider me a tough grader, however; I gave one of them a shock-her-into-shape C on her profile and she only ended up with a B+ in the class _despite_ writing one of the most brilliant articles I've had the pleasure to grade.  (About a conservative politician who wanted to be on Wheel of Fortune; ironically, the student ended up on Wheel of Fortune instead.)  All of which is only to say that I think people like me _despite_ being a tough grader; the fact that I give them back a single-spaced page of comments on everything they turn into me doesn't hurt in that respect.  They may not like what I have to say, but they know that I take it and therefore them seriously to spell it out (in a constructive fashion).  I think that defuses much of the animus students acquire over the course of a quarter . . . on which topic, yes, it's insane.  When I first arrived here, fresh from LSU's semestrial haven, I nearly lost my mind.  Eventually, however, you adjust.  

Kind of.

"although I'm not universally loved": Hey, at least three students think you're hot. That looks great on a CV _and_ is promising for the job search!
