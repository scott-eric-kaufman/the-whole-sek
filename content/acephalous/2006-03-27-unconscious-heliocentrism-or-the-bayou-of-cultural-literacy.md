## Unconscious Heliocentrism; or, The Bayou of Cultural Literacy

In the course of "Spate Heech" conversation, [Rodney](http://locus.cwrl.utexas.edu/herring/blog/2) dropped [this bombshell](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/dave\_lenihan\_at.html#comment-15382694):
But let me try to trip Scott up anyway, just for the fun of it! I think he _does_
believe in the unconscious, even if he doesn't realize it (and
especially if the latter is true, how much the better evidence for the
unconscious itself?). I believe this to be true because [The Best Quotation in the History of Everything](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/the\_best\_quotat.html)
means little if the quote doesn't carry more weight in its very
presence than it carries in its proportionality to the rest of S. Weir
Mitchell's writing. Such is the acuteness of [Laura's](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/the\_best\_quotat.html#comment-15193578)
question: "If you have read through reams & reams of this writer
and only found this one remark that fits your profile, isn't that kind
of a slender peg?" Well, of course it's not a slender peg, but only
because its presence (singular though it seems) reveals that Mitchell
was _pre_occupied by Lamarck, which is a way of saying that
unconsciously Lamarck was "in Mitchell's head." This is one of the
significances of ["The Writer's Mark"](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520059824/diesekoschmar-20).

[Laura](http://allordinary2.blogspot.com/)'s question _did_ flummox me.  (So much so I [tried](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/the\_best\_quotat.html#comment-15205215) and [failed](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/the\_best\_quotat.html#comment-15219533) to answer it twice.  Since the third time is _by definition_ the charm, this _will_ be my definitive answer.  Unless it isn't.)  But Mitchell'd articulated an opinion in absolute concord with the structure of thought whose existence I take inductive pains to document in my chapter.  To see expressed in plain English undeniable proof of what I had I reasoned from Mitchell's not unsubstantial corpus brought joy to my heart and bounce to my step.  Why?  

Here is where Rodney intervenes.  He claims that what I found amounts to Mitchell's unconscious adoption of Lamarckian thought.  A fine asseveration, that is, but not quite correct.  Mitchell was not "unconscious" of his Lamarckian influence in the psychoanalytic sense.  He was "unconscious" of them in the same way many literary critics are "unconscious" of the influence of Copernicus on their astronomical thought: it is _unacknowledged_—perhaps even unacknowledgeable—not _unconscious_.  An unacknowledged intellectual debt which takes the form of a cultural assumption differs from an unconscious belief in that it isn't un_conscious_ so much as un_thought_. 

It lives beneath the bayous of cultural literacy.  In the thick muck among the crawdads and the nutria.  Anyone who _wants_ to find it can . . . only most choose not to.  In this case most _have_ chosen not to.  "Social Darwinism" suffices for them.

Because they want it to it so desperately . . . 

. . . so desperately they'll see it even if it ain't there. 

And it ain't.  Don't believe me?

Buy my dissertation. 

From me.

Only I can.

This is just an idea I've been tossing around.

If we refused to accept explanations that refer to some kind of unconscious then Nietzsche, Freud and    ( in my ill informed opinion) perhaps even Marx would take a severe battering. In fact if there is no unconscious Theory takes an enormous hit because Theory explanations often work by attributing motives to persons who were certainly not aware of them in a way that wouldn't be plausible without an unconscious. Hence your rejection of the unconscious has implications that make the rejection of Freud look tame in comparision. I'm not judging your rejection either way, just pointing out what I think are it's implications.

You could draw on scientific literature attacking the notion of an unconscious to add to your already large generic anti theory arsenal. Imagine that, Theory destroyed by psychology.  Have you already tried yet?
