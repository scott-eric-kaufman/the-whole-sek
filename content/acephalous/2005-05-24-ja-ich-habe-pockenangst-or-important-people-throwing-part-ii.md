I'm starting a collection of amusing anecdotes about famous people throwing.  Here's the second one I've found, from Richard Preston's _The Demon in the Freezer_.  A Western doctor named Larry Brilliant is studying with [Neem Karoli Baba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neem\_Karoli\_Baba), one of the most influential mystics in India during Indira Gandhi's time as Prime Minister.  "The Blanket Baba," so-called because his sole possession was a plaid blanket, encouraged Brilliant to seek employment with the World Heatlh Organization.  Brilliant explains:
So I said, "What do I do?"  And he said, "Go to New Delhi.  Go to the office of the World Health Organization.  Go get your job.  _Jao, jao, jao jao_."  That means, "Go, go, go, go."

After a 17 hour journey, Brilliant arrived in New Dehli and met with Dr. Nicole Grasset, who informed him that WHO had no job to offer him.  Brilliant journeyed 17 hours back to the Blanket Baba's ashram and informed him of his failure.  
"Did you get your job?"  
"No."  
"Go back and get it."

Brilliant returned to New Dehli, again talked to Dr. Grasset, and again returned to the ashram without "his" job.
"I went back and forth between New Dehli and the ashram at least a dozen times.  All my teacher kept saying was, 'Don't worry, you'll get your job.  Smallpox will be _unmulun_, uprooted.'  When at the ashram, Brilliant meditated.  He would assume the lotus position, shut his eyes, and utter the sacred word _Aummmmm_.

Neem Karoli Baba would notice he was meditating, and he would walk up to Brilliant, yank an apple out from under his blanket, and throw it at Brilliant's testicles.  There would a _whack!_ and Brilliant's _Aummmmm_ would turn into _Oww God! My balls!_ and he would assume the "writhing lotus" position on the floor.  The guru seemed to be hinting, Brilliant says now, that he needed to stand up and on his feet and get back to the WHO in New Dehli, where his job awaited.

Based on my own very, very limited knowledge of Hinduism--by which I mean "that time I read Vikram Chandra's _Red Earth and Pouring Rain_--I'm not altogether surprised to learn that Neem Karoli Baba was a Hanuman devotee.  Make of my profound ignorance in this (as in all) matters what you will.
