## More for voyeurs: On panel transitions and narrative speed

Just [like the title says](http://acephalous.typepad.com/wr39b/2009/03/panel-transitions-for-thursday-2-april-2009.html).  And before anyone asks, it should be obvious that this is not the _only_ thing I'll be doing in class on Thursday.  It's the pump I'm using to prime a more interesting (and necessary) discussion about the rhetorical triangle—which, given how much fun I'm having image-manipulating right now, might just look like this:

[![Rhetoricaltriangle](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156fa95df7970b-500pi "Rhetoricaltriangle")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156fa95df7970b-pi)
 
   

Because there is ethos and then _there is ethos_.  But enough assorted silliness from me today.  I have serious papers about Ok, Big-Tooth, Afraid-of-the-Dark and Earnest Everhard to revise.

I love McCloud, but I think he missed the point on the non sequitur transitions. _Apparently_ non sequitur transitions are better classified as scene transitions where the location and connection of the scene are not yet obvious to the reader. True non sequitur transitions would be very, very rare....

I absolutely agree, which is why I didn't include it in my lesson plans.  Honestly, I've never seen a true non-sequitur in a comic save for the occasional meta-contextual "And now here's an image of a pig trying to fuck a chicken" you find in Crumb sometimes.

Let's see...no kryptonite around, so Super Man uses only one hand....?  

I think it's a sympathy ploy.  

Count your lucky, unexploded planets that I can catch these things before they get out of hand.
