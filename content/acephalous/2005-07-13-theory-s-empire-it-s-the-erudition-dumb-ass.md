[Few](http://www.tylerzander.com/wordpress/?p=295) [of](http://wormtalk.blogspot.com/2005/06/and-another-thing-thats-wrong-with.html) the [substantial](http://everyman.typepad.com/dustbowl/2005/06/its\_called\_erud.html) [responses](http://kevinjjones.blogspot.com/2005\_06\_01\_kevinjjones\_archive.html#112009712581578055) [to](http://crankyparadise.blogspot.com/2005/07/little-lit-theory.html) Mark Bauerlein's recent [review](http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/articleprint.php?num=134) of Theory's Empire ignored the "erudition exchange" (quoted below the fold in full).  [Michael Berube](http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/theory\_of\_everything/), sitting in the very same bus, verifies that the exchange took place and even _expands_ upon it.  Apparently this poor graduate student couldn't even _spell_ e-r-u-d-i-t-i-o-n.  Even as the _Theory's Empire_ symposium swung into gear, I couldn't stop thinking about the way people responded to the "erudition exchange."  Sure, I could point to the irony of people forwarding the review around [livejournal](http://www.livejournal.com/~ijon/170338.html)--"Look!  I know why I hate English professors: they're not erudite anymore.  They only repeat what other people say.  Mark Bauerlein says so.  Pass it on!"--but I knew its status as a meme with wheels had more to do with _something_ other than a lazy confirmation of other people's supposed intellectual shortcomings.  And I think it is.  But until I started seeing the responses to Adam Kotsko's [contribution](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/a\_respose\_to\_the\_deconstructive\_angel/) to the colloquium,  I didn't know what it was.  

Now I think I maybe do: it's the erudition, dumb-ass.  No, not the "erudition exchange," nor even what it's meant to convey.  It's the actual lack of a culture in which erudition is valued as anything other than an ideal.  What do I mean?  As I re-read Hillis Miller's [response](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0093-1896%!(NOVERB)
