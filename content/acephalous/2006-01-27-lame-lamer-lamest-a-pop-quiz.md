Which of the following five items is the _most_ lame:

1.  That Scott Eric Kaufman was listening to [the new Strokes album](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)B000BVQ9JO)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1).
2.  That while listening to the new Strokes album Kaufman dug the song "Razorblade."
3.  That Kaufman dug "Razorblade" because its melody is stolen from Barry Manilow's "[Mandy](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)B00005USBH)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1)."
4.  That Kaufman recognized Barry Manilow's "Mandy."

I think the lamest would have to be the implication of 3&4, 5:

5.  That Kaufman not only _recognized_ "Mandy," but he _enjoys_ it in the first place.

Don't see much lameness going on. What a lame post.

Back to the keypad with you! I want to see something on my desk by Monday.

I _so_ wrote something [substantial](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/601/) yesterday.  Sure, no one particularly _likes_ it, but it's not like blogging's a popularity contest, is it?  

(I _so_ don't enjoy "Mandy."  There's no way anything I said up there entails that dubious position.  Alright, maybe that I kept on listening to the song after realizing where the chorus came from, but at that point it was, um, more like an anthropological investigation than anything else.)

There are worse things than being Manilow fans--I personally know a couple of "Claymates," who call Clay Aiken "our generation's Barry Manilow."  Puh-leeze.  Barry writes his own songs and can play the piano. Clay looks like an overgrown Opie. 

I'll tell you what is lame:  being a fan of Manilow and Neil Diamond in a non-Sontag campy way and then hiding your CDs out of shame by swapping them into your Ramones and Clash CD covers. Not that I uh, ever did that kind of stuff. I uh, wear my lameness proudly.  Now where did I put that Foreigner album?

Follow the Scorcese approach. There is something stunning and original to be found in every movie (every song, every painting, etc) if you're open to it. 

Of course, the ratio of crap to stunning/original is HUGE, but at least a question of taste and aesthetics has been transformed into a   

problem of statistics.

I don't know, AW.  BL's giving you a run for your money.  

What I want to know, BL, is what exactly happened to all your Clash and Ramones CDs.  Do you store them in the Foreigner and Journey sleeves . . . and whip _those_ out at parties?  Because I could see that working so long as no one asked "So if _London Calling_'s in the Barry Manilow case, what's in the _London_ . . ."

So, are BL and I in a "lame-off" now?

'Cause, well, I \*did\* mention my abiding love for Journey, right?

Plus, admiration for Neil Diamond and Barry Manilow that isn't always entirely suffused with a Sontagian sense of camp? Check.

Now, I'll admit that I've never hidden either Manilow or Diamond in a Ramones sleeve. But: I used to close out all my parties with a Bon Jovi sing-along.

Also, I kinda actually like Christopher Cross sometimes. Especially when I get caught between the moon and New York City.

Does the winner's crown have a big, rhinestone-encrusted "L" dangling from the front in honor of its wearer's loserdom? If so, I want to make sure I pull my hair back for the ceremony.

I SO do not want to see who would win in a "Lame-Off" between me, AW, and Scott. But it would give me an excuse to buy that Bedazzler I've always wanted (as seen on TV!).

In response to your question, Scott, the Clash and the Ramones can be proudly displayed in any clear CD jewel case.  Manilow, Air Supply, and Neil Diamond (admit it, you rock out to "Comin' to America" too) are difficult to display because people look at you funny for owning them when you could listen to them on KOST 103.5 for free.

Wouldn't it be fun to go to a Karaoke Noribang and see who has the lamest taste in music?  I say winner of the Lame-Off gets to do a duet with Scott on "You Don't Bring Me Flowers" or "Two Less Lonely People In The World."

Lamest is your insinuation that Barry Manilow is not one of the most influential and important artists of our time.

AW, I think we're all involved in a ultra-mega-lame-off now, but I'm going to decline to participate.  Why?  Because I don't want to embarrass you and BL.  'Cause, really, neither of you has a chance.  If you knew how lame I _really_ was your brains would explode from intensity of the realization.  I am _that_ lame.  In what ways?  I'll never tell. 

At least until I do. 

P.S.  I amended the original post to read "five" after that first comment came in.  Not that I can actually count, mind you, just that in this one particular instance I think I did so correctly.

P.P.S. Expect another post on lameness in the near future, by which I mean, "tonight."

P.P.P.S.  Apparently I don't mean "tonight," since Typepad refuses to post what I've written.  So "tonight" now means "tomorrow," but I'll probably ante-date it so it looks like I posted tonight.  'Cause you know what's _not_ lame?  Creating the _appearance_ that one posts every day.  That, in fact, qualifies as "awesome."

Hmm. Well, I'll admit I'm skeptical, 'cause around these parts I'm known as the Lamest of the Lame. But I'll admit that may only be a regional title. I await this proof of your Ultimate Lameness, Scott.

And BL, I bow to you as a worthy opponent.

Do we still get to do the karaoke duets? I'm rather fond of both "Summer Lovin'" and "Don't You Go Breakin' My Heart," though both BL's suggestions were also outstanding. Alas, I can't think of anything sufficiently cheesy that's written for three voices.

oooo i so want a bedazzler.  You are aware that sequence and jewels are coming back in the \*it's so lame it's cool- i'm so cool i don't care that what i wear is super lame\* category, right?  And Scott, don't you know The Killers are the new The Strokes, soon to be replaced by The Blood Arm?

I see the word "bedazzler," but comic book nerd buried deep inside reads "I want to be Dazzler," which [just isn't cool](http://www.geocities.com/dpxcomics/dazzler01.jpg).  Also, I already went through my Killers phase, which, as you would expect, was equal in lameness to this current Strokes phase.  I haven't jump on the Blood Arm bandwagon, but that's only because I just learned one existed, um, now.  I suppose I have some "research" to do.

I checked out the pick--The Dazzler looks like she could be a spokesmodel for The Bedazzler:  [http://www.redferret.net/Images/bedazzler\_small.jpg](http://www.redferret.net/Images/bedazzler\_small.jpg)  

AW, I can't think of any 80s pop songs for the three of us.  Your choices are GREAT. Another great duet would be Meat Loaf's "I Would Do Anything For Love."  So we're going to have to find a group song to sing along to. I'm thinkin', TLC's Waterfalls.  I could be Chilli, you could be T-Boz, and I think Scott should be Left-Eye.  

"Don't go chasing waterfalls, please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to..."
