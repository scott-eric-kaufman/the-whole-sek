			I ignore those who insist that there’s [something](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15259) [untoward](http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/08/of-course-dems-push-for-obamacare-at.html) [about](http://patterico.com/2009/08/29/words-fail/) [discussing](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/08/29/its-come-to-this-dems-task-teddys-grandson-with-leading-funeral-prayer-for-obamacare/)
the life’s work of a man at his own funeral—they can begin with his
1970 Health Security Act and work their way forward to the Kennedy-Dodd
bill of 2009 on their own. I decline, that is, to say that had I
insisted on codifying my ideological commitments in a Senate bill a
month before my passing, I would have done so because those commitments
were so important to me in life that I wanted them to define my death.
Because, in the end, giving one’s natural death to a cherished cause
differs from dying for it only by dint of circumstance and timing: to
accomplish with one’s death what one fought for in life is the wish of
the true believer, and there is nothing untoward in that.  But, as I
said, there will be none of that.

Instead, I will marvel at the [stentorian stupidity](http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NWM4ZjhmOTg4NzExZTM4MzdlOGUyZDBiNTIwZGIyMmE=&w=Mg==) of [George H. Nash](http://www.kirkcenter.org/bios/georgenash.html),
who received a degree in History from Harvard in 1973 then promptly
forget everything he learned earning it.  To Nash, the death of Edward
Kennedy represents an opportunity to bemoan “a disconcerting historical
trend: the royalization of American politics.” Strangely, he does not begin his
investigations with the many powerful branches of the  [Adams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams\_family\_political\_line) or [Walker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush-Davis-Walker\_family\_political\_line) family trees (despite the former being the most prominent and the latter being the most recent). Instead, he claims that from

Theodore Roosevelt to Franklin Roosevelt to the Kennedys
and Camelot, American liberalism has repeatedly succumbed to this
phenomenon. It begins in a cult of personality, extends to the leader’s
wife and children, and then to a “court” of retainers and apologists.

The royalists, then, are not the ones descended from the [state representative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius\_Rockwell) of Massachusetts’s [7th district](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts%!s(MISSING)\_7th\_congressional\_district)—they are the descendants of the [impoverished Irish immigrant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick\_Kennedy\_%E2%931858%!)(MISSING)
that man represented from 1849 to 1851. That bears repeating: the
son-in-law of William Walker, Julius Rockwell, represented Patrick
Kennedy in the U.S. House of Representatives from the moment Kennedy
disembarked in 1849 until Rockwell resigned 1851 _and the only worrisome political royalty Nash can locate here are the Kennedys_?

Granted, the family to whom he extends this cultish devotion is
direct, “the leader’s wife and children,” so emphasis on the children
of the Joseph Kennedy, Sr. is warranted: Joseph Jr., John, Robert and
Edward are all direct descendants of a single powerful personage, as
are the relatives in his other example, the pair of fifth cousins
connected by a great-great-great-great-grandfather, Nicholas Van
Rosenvelt, upon whose death in 1742 the family splintered into the
Republican Oyster Bay and the Democratic Hyde Park Roosevelts.

Wait—now I’m confused.

Not only are the Roosevelts distant cousins instead of sons or
brothers, they also belong to opposing factions of a family that’s been
at political odds since before the Revolutionary War. How exactly are
Republicans who voted for Theodore and Democrats who voted Franklin
Delano symptomatic of American liberalism? Moreover, since Nash wants
to talk about cults of personality extending to wives and children and
courtiers, how could he not mention the two-term Connecticut Senator, [Prescott Bush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott\_Bush), whose son, [George Herbert Walker Bush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George\_H.\_W.\_Bush), and grandson, [George Walker Bush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George\_W.\_Bush), were both President? Does he believe the royalist inclinations of American liberalism are responsible for the Bushes?

Probably not, because this insidious royalism “starts in
hero-worship and ends in nostalgia,” and beloved as both Bushes are,
neither are afforded the “disturbing” and “disconcerting” treatment
“that for nearly a century has afflicted American liberalism.” Anything
that “starts in hero-worship and ends in nostalgia” threatens the body
politic with an idiot malignance . . . as Nash himself proves when he
starts the first paragraph of his essay with some hero-worship and ends
it with nostalgia:

On March 30, 1981, Pres. Ronald Reagan was nearly
assassinated. What if he had died that day, before he had persuaded
Congress to enact his signature program of tax cuts? Would his liberal
opposition on Capitol Hill have given up their philosophical opposition
to his agenda? Would they have stood silent if militant conservatives
had tried to rush through sweeping tax-cut legislation as a monument to
Reagan’s legacy?

Translation:

“What if the Great Hero had died in 1981? Would the Golden Age for which I now pine have ever come to be?”

I believe he was better off pretending two of the four most recent
Presidents weren’t immediate kin—at least then he made my job a wee bit
difficult.
