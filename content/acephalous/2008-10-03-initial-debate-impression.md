## Initial debate impression

Tonight the Republican Party outed itself as [the proud parent of a C- student](http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/02/debate.transcript/):

Well, our founding fathers were very wise there in
allowing through the Constitution much flexibility there in the office
of the vice president. And we will do what is best for the American
people in tapping into that position and ushering in an agenda that is
supportive and cooperative with the president's agenda in that
position. Yeah, so I do agree with him that we have a lot of
flexibility in there, and we'll do what we have to do to administer
very appropriately the plans that are needed for this nation.

I admit: unedited transcripts make everyone sound like an idiot.  However, so does sounding like an idiot.  I'm with [Burke](http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=649) and [Bérubé](http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/so\_you\_palin\_mockers\_think\_youre\_so\_smart/)
on this one: she sounded like a student bluffing her way through an
exam she crammed for three hours earlier.  At times she was passable
--- but only barely.  She tacked back to her charted course five
seconds into every answer, irrespective of the question, because she
could only fit so much on those notecards the cameras didn't once catch
her repeatedly shuffling through --- did I just call them notecards?

I meant _cheat sheets_.  Please, America, I beg of you: be as
smart as the squiggly lines CNN had representing your core convictions
are accurate.  Live up to the ideals embodied by 
those squiggly lines
 our Founding Fathers.

I'd pay good money to see what was on those cheat sheets, wouldn't you? 

Just for _historical_ purposes, mind you.
