## A rambling, incoherent Sarah Palin celebrates Independence Day by disrespecting the troops.

Sarah Palin closed her confused [resignation speech](http://www.gov.state.ak.us/exec-column.php) by quoting a famous American general:

In the words of General MacArthur said, “We are not retreating. We are advancing in another direction.”\*

Of course, given the depth of Palin’s erudition—[like Reagan](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/07/-and-the-award-for-missing-the-point-goes-to.html), she’s “dumb as a fox” to [those who watch](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/07/03/breaking-palin-to-make-an-announcement-in-wasilla-at-3-pm-et/comment-page-1/#comment-2383459) [her press conferences on mute](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/07/03/breaking-palin-to-make-an-announcement-in-wasilla-at-3-pm-et/comment-page-2/#comment-2383684)—it should surprise no one that she grabbed the first patriotic-sounding quotation about “advancing” [that Google returned](http://www.google.com/search?q=advancing+quotes) and tacked it onto her speech. 

This is what passes for knowledge among some conservatives: the
ability to quote-mine the internet for something that sounds patriotic.
(Google may not [be making _us_ stupid](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/google),
but the same cannot be said for many of them.) Because their paragon of
intellectual achievement is a woman who cannot remember what newspapers
she reads every day, it is only fitting that Palin’s last words on the
national stage—intended to demonstrate that the “easy path” in life
paradoxically involves “plod[ding] along” by “sit[ting] down and
shut[ting] up,” because everyone knows that “a quitter’s way” is one of
perseverance in the face of adversity—should be a misattributed
misquotation ripped from its context in a way that conservatives would,
under normal circumstances, consider insulting.

In attributing the quotation to General MacArthur, she is
disrespecting the life and service of the man who actually spoke
something similar to those words; and in analogizing her plight to that
of the men who served under the General she disrespected, she is
belittling the memory of their sacrifice. 

In the winter of 1950, General Oliver Prince Smith and his 1st Marine Division were ordered to march north to the [Yalu River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalu\_River),
on the border between China and Korea. The order was given by Major
General Edward “Ned” Almond, an obsequious lackey with an ego to rival
Patton’s who functioned as “MacArthur’s MacArthur [by taking]
MacArthur’s vision of what was supposed to happen and [bringing] it
directly to Korea, where he employed it, whether it fitted the Korean
reality or not” ([_The Coldest Winter_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401300529/diesekoschmar-20)
163). Smith, called “Professor” for his deliberate manner and attention
to detail, surveyed the land and determined that the Korean reality
didn’t fit MacArthur and Almond’s vision at all, and though he obeyed
the command to press north, he did so in a manner that befitted his
nickname:

General Almond had already begun to notice that the
spearhead was hardly moving at all. We were in fact just poking
along—deliberately so. We pulled every trick in the book to slow down
our advance, hoping the enemy would show his hand before we got more
widely dispersed than we already were. At the same time we were
building up our levels of supply at selected dumps along the way. (432)

When the Chinese attacked the 1st Marine Division (19,000 soldiers)
with six divisions (60,000 soliders) of its own in the Chosin River
Basin, Smith and his soldiers were prepared: by day, they would avoid
the roads by moving south through the mountainous terrain, shelling the
advancing Chinese from the high ground; by night, they would temper the
bitter chill of winter by hunkering down near the dumps Smith had had
the foresight to supply. 

Smith had calculated the odds of a successful push north, found them
wanting, and prepared for the inevitable. So when the vastly outmanned
1st Marine had to move back through the Chosin Reservoir, they were
able to inflict massive casualties on the superior Chinese force, which
lost 40,000 troops to the 1st Marine’s 561. When a journalist asked how
Smith and his men had done so much damage while retreating, Smith
replied:

Retreat, hell . . . we’re simply attacking in another direction. (470)

Palin’s hastily convened press-conference and incoherent statement
are, to her mind, analogous to Smith’s carefully planned
counter-offensive—or would be, if she knew Smith said it. Which means
that for her, MacArthur is not a hero to be venerated, but a prop to
wheeled out when it’s politically expedient to do so. She cares nothing
for the man himself or those under his command. If she did, she would
show her respect by _doing more than a Google search and pulling the first “good” quotation she found_.
After all, nothing demonstrates a deep and abiding respect for the
military more forcefully than the sort of stunt my freshmen pull.

So Sarah Palin flubbed the quotation _and_ the attribution. So she appropriated the phrase of a man who _fought_
the inane orders of blinkered bureaucrats and took what she so
arrogantly dismisses as “the worthless, easy path.” He took what she
calls “a quitter’s way out,” laying the groundwork for his success in
the face of adversity by “keep[ing his] head down” and “plod[ding]
along.” So what: _Smith_ is the quitter. He didn’t even _advance_ in a different direction, he merely _attacked_.

To go back to an analogy with which Palin is
comfortable—basketball—Smith looked at the game plan, surveyed the
opposing team, and ran the point in a way that would guarantee a shot
at victory. He urged his men to challenge the bigger, stronger team in
the lane; to take the charges, shoot the foul shots, and keep the game
the close until the buzzer. Palin, however, panicked when the situation
on the floor didn’t correspond to her game plan, _grabbed the ball and ran crying off the court_.

\*That’s what 
she said
 her [official state government page](http://www.gov.state.ak.us/exec-column.php) said she was going to say, but it seems [she did better](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/07/04/a-rambling-incoherent-sarah-palin-celebrates-independence-day-by-disrespecting-the-military/#comment-49034), at least grammatically. Her logic’s still a horrid mess.

Two "in fairness" points: First, conservatives may be shockingly tolerant of Palin's intellect, but I don't think you could find even a Free Republic commenter to call her the conservative "paragon of intellectual achievement," or even something close enough to make the hyperbole fair.

Second, she actually _didn't_ do the "In the words of General MacArthur said" gaffe in the actual speech.  Yes, it's in the written remarks, but if you watch the video what she says is, "Take the words of General MacArthur.  He said…"  I was disappointed, because I read the speech first and was anxious to see her say that, but it seems that her improvisation served her well there.

Actually, shockingly, I didn't find that anywhere near as bad as I'd been led to expect. Sure, most of it was boilerplate she's been using for a year or more, and most of that could have been dropped _if you're not a politician interested in creating a public record_, but she actually did OK. 

Yeah, not on the quotation, but she could well be telling us that she, like Smith, is playing a different game. That much I believe.

That's pretty good, Terry.

I just want to amend my previous statement: I still don't understand what she's trying to accomplish, but, unlike some of her campaign moments, I did understand what she was trying to say.
