## For John Emerson's Eyes Only

_It is a Friday night in a posh "green" hotel.  (Meaning there are no phone books and the [toilet paper scours tender bottoms](http://www.hbo.com/larrydavid/episode/season6/episode54.html).)  [Blogging mega-stars](http://www.artsjournal.com/quickstudy/2007/10/watching.html) Scott Kaufman and [John Holbo](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/) convene in the lobby.  They come prepared: Holbo wears a leather jacket, Kaufman a corduroy one.  They sit pensively and discuss [a lecture](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/metadata\_plus\_shakespeares\_afterlife/) Kaufman didn't attend.  An elevator door opens.  Out walks a young man who has also come prepared: it is [Adam Kotsko](http://www.adamkotsko.com/), clad in a jacket made of leather and rage._
**Kotsko:** (_bears his teeth with a growl_)****Are you ... ?  

**Kaufman:** (_politely_)  Yes.  Nice to finally meet you.

**Holbo:** (_unbuttons his shirt to reveal a chest oiled for battle_)  Likewise.  So we were just saying ...

**Kaufman:** (_politely_) ... that we didn't think it was going to be any big deal if we ...

**Kotsko:** (_reaches behind his back for a cudgel_)  Wait, which one is "we," I mean ...

**Kaufman:** (_politely_)  Sorry.  (_handsomely_)  I'm Scott.  He's Holbo.

**Kotsko:** (_eyes oozing hatred_)  Adam, nice to meet you.

**Holbo:** (_with violence in his heart_)  So we're waiting for Wilczak, right?  

**Kaufman:** (_politely_)  Yep.  He's one of Meg's oldest friends, and he has this Ethiopian restaurant he wants to take us to.

**Kotsko:** (_lasers shooting from his eyes_)  Works for me.

**Holbo:** (_shields holding at ninety percent_)  Sounds delicious.

_Kaufman's cell-phone rings.  In the background, Holbo and Kotsko viciously compare jackets.  Kaufman motions them to follow, and like two beasts leashed to the same master, they oblige.  They walk out of the hotel and under a heating lamp._
**Kotsko:** (_full of lunatic rage_)  Is that really necessary?

**Holbo:** (_genocide on his mind_)  I don't understand that. 

**Kaufman:** (_politely shivering_)  It's not like it's c-c-cold out.

**Wilczak:** (_unaware of the lurking violence_)  So how you been, Scott?

**Kaufman:** (_politely shivering_)  C-c-can't complain ...

_The group makes its way to Wilczak's nifty new Volkswagen Jetta.  Kaufman offers the taller Holbo the front seat.  Holbo declines.  Thoughts of Back-Seat Thunderdome pulse from his and Kotsko's eyes.  The car starts and they chat idly for five minutes, until ..._
**Kotsko:** (_with a look that would wet Steven Seagal's trousers_)  ... and then we realized where the loufah came from.

**Kaufman:** (_his polite eyes politely aglow with prophecy_)  This play sucks.  Four people went out for a fun dinner.  We laughed with and at each other.  It was fun.  [Emerson](http://idiocentrism.com/)'s [trying](http://www.haloscan.com/comments/adamkotsko/5537352559194037582/#748355) to [stir](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/metadata\_plus\_shakespeares\_afterlife/#18052) [shit up](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/dear-good-sense.html#comment-86562410) because he's bored.  

**Kotsko:** (_needle laser pellets firing rapidly from his soulless eyes_)  What?

**Holbo:** (_fingers threateningly a-crackle with the dark power of The Analytic_)  What?

**Kaufman:** (_his polite voice thundering with polite portents of future inquiries_)  I CAN HEAR THE EMERSONIAN.  HE SPEAKS IN PLAIN TONGUE BUT MEANS HARM.  HE CAN NOT LET THE SHIT SETTLE.  WHEN THE RAINS COME TO THE SOUTHERN LANDS HE MUST STIR THEM.  HEED MY WORDS.  LINK TO THIS POST.  DO NOT LET HIS SINGLENESS PERSUADE YOU TO ... (_coughing_) ... to ... (_coughing_) ... sorry about that.  Got something caught in my throat.  So anyway, about _House_ ...

Would that you knew the truth ... fortunately, Kotsko knew a local dentist on call whenever.

CR, um, you told us not to write anything about the meet-up, so as to preserve your anonymity.  I even remember getting in a little trouble for linking to a picture of you ... but had you said otherwise, I would've documented you and Holbo's first meeting in great detail.  

Rich, what's sad is that I read through that thread having no idea what it was about ... then encountered my own comment.  I've left bits of brain around the internet, and can only hope they do me justice (though I doubt it).

Lou, so you'll be joining us in December?  Awesomeness.  I'm intrigued by the entry of your collective into our (honestly) stagnant pond, and am willng to be convinced that you're an actual collective, as opposed to the single schizophrenic someone claimed "y'all" to be.

Sisyphus, I've missed WP too, but a hiatus is a hiatus, no?

How do you have four things in a troika? More importantly, why wasn't I invited? 

There is a Rule that fun things are not allowed to happen without me. This Rule has now been broken. Be warned.

Scott, we are a collective indeed, however we are shamefully retarded when it comes to "all things blogging" and there is all kinds of confusion that we're trying to sort out like how to log in and post under your own @$&%!i(MISSING)ng name and all that stuff - ok, i am personally very retarded when it comes to it so it is most likely my fault - however, the idea of a schizophrenic blog is also a very tempting one: better a schizophrenic out for a walk...

Adam, the meeting is impending and inevitable - i will be in San Diego in November, well actually in Santa Barbara, but there is an equally impending gathering of old dicks in San Diego due to the great AAR circus coming to town, so since you are giving a speech at SBL, i thought i'd stop by and introduce myself, if that is not too overbearing and pathetic... one other member of our collective will be there as well so maybe that will help disprove the current schizophrenia theory

thanks for kind words, scott - i actually like the accusation of schizophrenia - i believe we need to do _more_ to appear as if we are really one person, however that would involve a lot of coordination and effort. i realize from my short experience with blogging that a) it [online schizophrenia] is expremenly easy to do, b) it seems that it's been done before, c) i'm really naive and trusting when it comes to online personalities, d) apparently there is such thing as "blogging mega-stars", e) i desperately would like to be "mega" of just about anything as long as i can add it to my name, f) it appears that i know latin alphabet all the way to the letter "f" but it gets hazy afterwards so i will have to stop... 

P.S. John McCumber has a nice piece about [furtinure and philosophy](http://proteviblog.typepad.com/outside\_philosophy/2007/10/beethovens-scor.html) on his new blog (protevi's new blog) - check it out! i think the old-timer needs some support from the blogging community, talk about late starts there...

CR is the man in the chariot, whipping the three others on. The man sent from the Central Committee. No one knows his real name.

oh yeah. I forgot about that. Mostly I'm wondering why Emerson didn't ask about it. 

_How do you have four things in a troika? More importantly, why wasn't I invited?_

Sisy, we'll have the Big Boat thing with SEK, and I'll be sure to post photos of you in prominent places just for the benefit of the places you'll be doing your interviews and job talks with. And now I'm officially signed on to MLA, which ALSC members aren't allowed to attend, so we'll have to do it without the Valvers. 

_CR is the man in the chariot, whipping the three others on. The man sent from the Central Committee. No one knows his real name._

I don't really know what this means. But everyone knows my real name except for you, John Emerson. 

I may go fully nonymous soon. Due to a change in situation and the context of that situation. Let me just get where I'm going and I'll see. 

It would be a great test of longtermers vs. noobs in our circle - what does "CR" mean... (Points for snark and perversion in your guesses...)

CR, what did I ever do to you that you're going to post incriminating pictures of me and destroy all my chances of future wealth and happiness? Or dignity? There are still a few people in this world who think I have dignity.

Just for that I may have to hide and send my minions out to deal with you instead. 

And why aren't ALSC people allowed at MLA? Will there be an armed cordon of guards they'd be unable to pass through? 

What's so great about nonymity? It's still an advantage to not have students stalking your blog or random researchers googling a comment page full of snarky horseplay ---- besides, how many people have a name that actually means something in a personal and individualistic way, or picked out their own real name? To take one example, I can think of hundreds of people named "Scott" so it doesn't speak to someone's uniqueness or personality the way a well-chosen screen name can. ... What _does_ CR stand for, anyway?

This is an excellent Dave Sim parody, Scott.

Who is this 'Kotsko' asshole though? Isn't he like 19 years old?
