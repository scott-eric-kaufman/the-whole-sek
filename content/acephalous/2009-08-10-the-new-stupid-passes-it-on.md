## The New Stupid passes it on.

Conservatives are outraged that members of the Service Employees International Union were [allowed to attend](http://www.breitbart.tv/st-louis-town-hall-turmoil-were-protesters-barred-as-union-members-entered/) Representative Russ Carnahan’s town hall, but [conservatives](http://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2009/08/07/photos-and-video-carnahan-event-in-st-louis/) were [turned away](http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/08/shock-video-dems-sneak-union-thugs-into.html). Similarly, liberals were outraged when they were denied entry to Representative Kevin Brady’s town hall, but [the ninety conservative doctors whose hospital sponsored the event](http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6563705.html)
were allowed in. I would link to those outraged liberals, but I
invented them. While I’m sure many liberals would complain if the [sponsor of an event](http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/08/town-hall-tumult.html) had seats reserved for its members, I can’t find them. I can, however, find many conservatives who [know that the SEIU is sponsoring these town halls](http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas\_shrugs/2009/08/obamas-contempt-for-the-american-people-roundup.html), but [still write](http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009/08/chicago\_thug\_tactics.html) that “the [SEIU] union thugs had already been quietly ushered in through the _back door_, and had already taken seats that were _reserved_ for them in the front.”

They are upset, first, that the _sponsor_ of an event _reserved_ seats for its _members_; and second, that when protesters prevented _members_ of the group that _sponsored_ the event from reaching the seats _reserved_ for them, the group _sponsoring_ the event might resort to ferrying its _members_ to their _reserved_
seats by an alternate route. Even without the excessive italics, that
much should be obvious—only it isn’t, and while the quality of
mainstream political discourse has never been that high, rarely has it
been this low.

My standard for quality is not based on civility so much as the that of [forensic debate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Forensics\_speech\_and\_debate).
The rule to which all debaters abide is, plainly but multitudinously,
“Never say anything they can use against you.” If you lack the
reflexivity required to know whether your words will return to haunt
you, you will lose often and spectacularly. That’s why, when the stakes
are high, it’s best to be attacking what you believe or defending what
you don’t. Your beliefs only impair your argument, because what matters
is not what you know, but what you can prove. The last thing you want
to do is hand your opponent the ammunition they need to accomplish your
execution. In the 1990s, mainstream conservativism understood this well
enough: it distanced itself from the Foster dramatics and focused on an
affirmative offensive, be it about a Contract with Certain Americans or
marital infidelities.

Absurdity mattered less than strategy, because as frustrating as
those absurdities were, they sat well in the stomach because we knew
that they were merely strategic: the machinations of Newton Leroy
Gingrich were clearly machinations, and although we could and did call
the man who married his high school math teacher two days after he
turned eighteen a hypocrite, we never doubted his ability to [excuse our dear Aunt Sally](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order\_of\_operations#Mnemonics),
nor did we care how exactly he pleased her, because we understood that
no matter how or where he chose to do so, he knew order of her
operations—uterine surgery in ‘78, another in ‘80, and [four-hundred and forty dollars a month](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/1984/11/newt-gingrich-shining-knight-post-reagan-right)
to provide for an ailing woman, his two children, and a dry cleaning
bill for one. Whether or not he ever said his wife was neither “young
enough or pretty enough to be the wife of a President, and besides, she
has cancer,” we never doubted that he was capable of such a calculus.
He was a pure political animal, predictable, and when he spoke
stupidly, he did so to inflame his enemies into breaching super-dense
patches of stupid that corrupted their every communiqué: “We are
approaching bluster tape,” their communications officer would relay.
“Permission to canister the light and holder the cup with scrap
medicine?” As soon as the words left our lips, we understood the nature
of the con in which we had cast ourselves as marks.

Strategic hypocrisy we understood, could compartmentalize, and
proffer rejoinder—but the New Stupid is different.  It is an
unstrategic stupid emboldened by an unselfconscious hypocrisy, meaning
we face an opposition who hands us their rifles and implores us not to
fire them; offers us bullets on the condition that we not load those
rifles; then they take their place against the wall and proceed to
taunt us.  “You may have rifles and bullets,” they shout, “but you
don’t know from loading guns.  Even if you somehow managed to load the
bullets we  provided into the rifles we also provided you,” they
continue, “you lack  the character required to shoot them.  If you
don’t believe us, we will hector you mercilessly until you acquire it,
and then you will shoot us with a cold smile on your face and we will
die, even though we expressly told you we didn’t want you to shoot us
when we handed you the rifles and the bullets.”  Knowing how it will
end, the temptation to butt them senseless as soon as we secure their
rifles is almost impossible to overcome; but we must remember that we
are not dealing with savvy political operatives here, nor even with the
toadies who absorbed tactical hypocrisy on their bouncing knees.

We are dealing with a lowest common denominator that bootstrapped
itself into relevance on the bent back of technological innovation. The
super-dense stupid that Gingrich once goaded us into breaching now
houses the headquarters of our political opponents, from which they
beam their new brand of stupid to the masses:

The Service Employees International Union sponsored this meeting, but I am outraged, I say, _outraged_
that the SEIU reserved seats for its member at it, because that is
wrong, because this is America, and I will not stand for any seating
arrangement in which money means access, unless it happens to be a
baseball game, in which case I will pay outrageous sums for a seat that
lets me see sweat gather, bead, and roll down the line of Derek Jeter’s
jaw—because that is capitalism, capitalism is American, and America is
awesome.

Without the faith we once placed in the operatives of zero-sum
politics, such statements can’t be dismissed as self-interested
calculation: they emanate from the emo core of the New Stupid, which
was created by the two historically unique broadcast systems born in
the 1990s.  The first of which, talk radio, came into its own with the
rise of Rush Limbaugh; the second is the internet generally and blogs
in particular.  Although both were around before, they had yet to
acquire the political prominence they would in the wake of Lewinsky
(radio) and the build-up to the Second Gulf War (the internet and
blogs).  Consider this: if you were 18 years old in 1992 and a
conservative, your knowledge of political discourse would amount to
Limbaugh’s campaign against the Clinton administration and the defense
of Bush policy he and online conservatives mounted.  You would be about
the age of the average political blogger, but for the first time in
your adult life _you are politically impotent_.

Granted, there were those two awful years (1992-1994) in which
Clinton worked with a Democratic Congress, but that was almost two
decades ago and is but a distant memory.  For the past seventeen years,
conservatives have framed every issue however they pleased; moreover,
for the past nine years they have dominated the narrative so thoroughly
that liberals were forced to oppose preemptive invasions, insist that
American soldiers would not be greeted as liberators, and denounce
those who willfully lied before, during and now in the dénouement of a
suspect war in which no American soldier was greeted as a liberator. 
Those conservatives who came of age during this period have never been
out of power—and those who came of age earlier have forgotten how it
stung—and try as they might to harness the fear this doggedly centrist
regime instills in them, all they can muster is a stampeding panic. 
They are like cattle on the open range who, having heard horror stories
about wolves their entire lives, trample themselves silly at the sight
of [this dread beast](http://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/puppy.jpg).

Of course, by “trample” I mean “soldier on,” which is exactly what
the right-wing radio that sustained them through the 1990s and the
conservative blogs by which they cudgeled the narrative into shape in
the 2000s are doing.  But absent the men in powerful places required to
authorize their specious interpretations of suspect facts, their
conversations increasingly resemble idle gossip in a endless [game of telephone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese\_whispers)
amplified over the airwaves and through a series of tubes: before
leaving for work, a conservative communicates his displeasure about
some milksop Obama initiative to his neighbor; when he returns home,
his wife informs him that the gay Kenyan in the White House wants to
kill grandma.  Exactly how his complaint was corrupted—from Rush to
some blog, some blog to Fox, Fox to Rush, Rush to Hannity, Hannity to
some blog—is less important than the inevitability that it would be.

These conservatives in their 30s and 40s are willing to believe
anything because, for the past two decades, they have been in the
business of making things believable.  What liberals see as a game of
telephone being played by idiots with crap reception, conservatives
call “reporting.”  Only without an Administration to accommodate their
pretensions to reality—to interrupt the game with a reminder of the
original statement—their message is running away from them so quickly
that their latest champion is [a guy whose hurt shoulder put him in a wheelchair](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB0wQDhKVcE).  (Not that it’s impossible to suffer grave bodily harm and seem fine at first [as Kenneth Gladney did in [the video](http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/faking-victimhood-just-how-hurt-was)]: [I got hit by a car and walked home](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/why\_i\_didnt\_pos.html) because adrenaline works wonders.  But being drugged into speechless the day _after_
you made the right-wing rounds for ten hours is mighty suspicious.) 
Kenneth Gladney claims he was kicked and punched mercilessly and says
the video backs him up.  Conservative blogs concur and Rush and Fox
agree:

The tape clearly shows that Gladney was beheaded by union jihadists personally selected by the Kenyan himself.  Pass it on.

That Hannity will say this _while interviewing Gladney_
demonstrates why he would never win a formal debate.  Not that he has
to—the New Stupid will say he did no matter how he performed.  Rush
will concur and conservative blogs will agree:

Sean Hannity brought Gladney back from the dead with two
toothpicks, a bottle of antifreeze and the power of Christ.  Pass it on.

Actually, I'm reminded of the Qizilbash and Boxers, Warriors of Faith who believed that their righteousness made them invulnerable to bullets. And they did a lot of damage before their enemies rounded up _enough_ bullets.

And they say we're the ones who don't from guns.

_That should work just fine._

It does feel better.  I started this Saturday morning, and revised it continuously until I posted it.  I won't have to do silent-revisions-for-style in a week (not that I ever do them, except when I do, which is frequently), because I'm happy enough with the prose to let it stand un-re-re-re-read.  But also, and good God damn, you can tell I'm reading _Inherent Vice_, no?  (Which probably means I over-wrote this and will need to calm it down in the days to come.)  But for now, I think the improved quality of the prose and the increased pleasure I had in crafting it is worth the risk of being three beats behind the curve.  (And I'm [not the only one](http://adswithoutproducts.com/2009/08/10/hell-2-journaux-intimes/#comment-3023).)

(Of course, I'll hate all of this come soon-enough-already, but I'll wait until that angst grabs me before worrying about its inevitable arrival.  Because, really, what's the point in doing that?)

I'll post this here because the shouting at EotAW has already commenced.

So... the difference is that now you allow yourself to be a couple of days behind the cable and internet brouhaha (which I hadn't previously heard of) to overwrite this?  I know you've said before that you absorb the style of others to 
consume their souls
 learn from their strengths, but, man, editting!

It's pretty simple and actually pretty tactical in a ham-handed way.  The SEIU (who, from a labor point of view, are not without faults as well as strengths) are the one union agressively pushing a pro-labor public policy agenda.  Other unions sponsor candidates and make quiet endorsements in their internal newsletters, but the SEIU actually gets out there in the public square and mixes it up.  From a coservative point of view, this cannot stand.  Not only is it creeping socialism, it's creeping successful progressive politics, which is even worse, because possibly real.  "So if ACORN are vote frauders (rather than just incredibly sloppy), SEIU must be ... Teamsters from the 1970s!  Great, we've already been using that image to try and convince people that they should want to keep the additional six months of employer intimidation before they can get union representation."

Oh, and the historians over at that other place have been holding back but: 1) I'm guessing if you ask any Americanist about this, they will say, as if by reflex, "Well, things may look nasty now, but in the 19th century, American politicians were literally bashing eachother's skulls in with maces and sicking packs of vicious badgers on their opponents' supporters." 2) There were at least a dozen American soldier greeted as liberators -- in semi-autonomous Kurdistan -- for the first couple of years. 3) Quotations marks can indeed be used for humorous sock-puppetry, but blockquotes should, nay must, be reserved for actual quotey quotes.

_So... the difference is that now you allow yourself to be a couple of days behind the cable and internet brouhaha (which I hadn't previously heard of) to overwrite this?_

I relieve myself of the pressure of having to address issues by forcing myself to address them more scholarly-like.  Over the past year, I'd gotten way too close to issues best addressed as elements in the bigger picture; so, in this case, instead of mocking conservatives openly, I stepped back, thought about how their movement reached this moment, and this is the result.

_I'm guessing if you ask any Americanist about this, they will say, as if by reflex, "Well, things may look nasty now, but in the 19th century, American politicians were literally bashing eachother's skulls in with maces and sicking packs of vicious badgers on their opponents' supporters."_

Hey!  I'm an Americanist too, damn it!  I understand your point, by the way, but the scale of the nastiness and the means by which it's communicated was more of my point here.  

_Quotations marks can indeed be used for humorous sock-puppetry, but blockquotes should, nay must, be reserved for actual quotey quotes._

It's funny you should mention that, because I've been having a lot of issues---personal-type issues---with formatting of late.  I waffled for hours before deciding how to do up [this thing](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/07/the-passion-of-the-sotomayor-part-ii.html), and looking at it now, think I punted it.

Adam, not only have I seen that, it's [been confirmed](http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2009/08/11/pynchon-revealed/).  I'm glad I didn't respond before I read that, because I was going to say that there's no way that's Pynchon, because the guy I know who's met him says he has a think New York accent.  Apparently, the man can also act.

_Hey! I'm an Americanist too, damn it!_  

I meant an Americanist _historian_.  This you will only be once you get invited on news shows and when they ask you "Has the quality of mainstream political discourse in America ever been this low?" (actually they'd ask if it had ever been this "contentious" or "filled with personal attacks" or some such), you don't say "Well it is at an especially low poit at the moment.  Let me analyze for you the misuses of rhetoric which produces such a lowly condition", but instead respond with a laugh, "Well, _actually_, there were, in the past, entire armies of badger-wielding ruffians let loose upon the political discourse" and then blather on for a while about Grover Cleveland.

Actually, if you can reposition yourself as a "media analyst," a title for which there are no known qualifications, you could do very well for yourself in the cable news economy. Eventually, they're going to want someone who can both laugh at this crap and explain it.

My standard for quality is not based on civility so much as [] that of forensic debate.That's an elegant and artfully composed sentence.  

Are you saying that civility _is_ a virtue in this setting, although not as important as the excellence demonstrated by skilled debaters? 

Or are you saying that civility _isn't_ important, whereas other standards of forensic debate are?

Is ambiguous speech to be preferred, at times?  In the setting of a formal debate, or a blog post?

Many of the anti-Obama-healthcare-proposals antics that you bemoan are offenses against [a code of decency to be applied in everyday life](http://krieger.jhu.edu/civility/foreword.html), as much as they are blunders in a forensic sense.

This is brilliant New Stupidese, from Investor's Business Daily:

"People such as scientist Stephen Hawking wouldn't have a chance in the UK, where the National Health Service would say the life of this brilliant man, because of his physical handicaps, is essentially worthless."

El Reg comments:  

"The paper has since been notified that Hawking is both British and still among the living... "I wouldn’t be here today if it were not for the NHS," Hawking told The Guardian. "I have received a large amount of high-quality treatment without which I would not have survived."

The best you can say about Investor's Business Daily is that unlike US radio talk host Rush Limbaugh, it has not compared Obama's health care logo to a swastika."

_Are you saying that civility is a virtue in this setting, although not as important as the excellence demonstrated by skilled debaters?_

In this context, I simply meant that I wasn't going to discuss civility, which is how the debate's being framed basically everywhere else.  That said, I'm not sure whether you can call "civility" a virtue in forensics; a certain mode of _pro forma_ politeness is encouraged, but its absence wouldn't be held against a debater.  Moreover, the measures of civility associated with these debates have to do with yelling and talking over people, whereas forensic debates always sound [like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvNNtEVkckc#t=0m24s).

_Is ambiguous speech to be preferred, at times? In the setting of a formal debate, or a blog post?_

In context, I don't think my statement was ambiguous: I was just saying that I was concerning myself with issues of argument and evidence, not civility.

Naadir, I saw that and absolutely couldn't believe it.  If ever you want an example of someone violating the first rule of forensic debate, there you have it: "This man, who is alive thanks to the British health care system, would be dead if he lived under the British health care system."
