## According to an actual Iranian in Iran, the administration’s silence helps the cause.

A former
student of mine from Iran heard from his brother for the first time in
a couple of days. When my student bemoaned the cautiousness of Obama
administration’s statements, his brother confirmed one aspect of [Spencer Ackerman’s account of the administration’s behavior](http://washingtonindependent.com/46957/obamas-iran-policy-to-focus-on-human-rights-not-election),
saying that government forces are already accusing protesters of
collaborating with the U.S., and that protesters are actually _worried_
that Obama will make an explicit show of support, as that would restore
some credibility to what the government has said about the election
and, more importantly, could undermine a reform coalition in which some
factions are none-too-fond of America.  

[Everyone](http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/06/madness-obama-administration-silent-as.html) [prematurely](http://thinkprogress.org/2009/06/15/mccain-act-iran/) [condemning](http://confederateyankee.mu.nu/archives/288543.php) the administration’s [apparent](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YjVkMGRjYWFkMjg2MWJmY2VkN2RkMjczNWU0ODlhZTU=) [silence](http://legalinsurrection.blogspot.com/2009/06/he-who-cannot-stop-talking-is-silent-on.html) [on this](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2009/06/speak\_for\_america\_president\_ob.html) [matter](http://townhall.com/blog/g/2b117a45-e677-4e36-9e9f-1a26efaa97d0) may want to rethink the offensive idea that he’s merely "[voting ‘present.’](http://patterico.com/2009/06/15/iranians-detonate-reality-bomb/)" 
I’m not saying we should take my student’s brother’s word on this as
definitive, but it does make one point absolutely clear: most of the
people complaining about the administration’s response are more
concerned with playing American politics than the situation on the
ground in Iran.

That's my impression, too, just from similar discussions.  Obama has apparently quietly done some things that might help (even urging Twitter to delay some scheduled maintenance), but overt statements could play into anti-reformist hands.

He doesn't need to come out for either side. "Meddling" was what he called that, and he was right: It would look like a prime example of just that. 

That would hurt the resistance. I just hope to God that he sticks a sock in Biden's mouth or the gaffe-o-matic might just screw things up.

Oops, it looks like the U.S. has been accused of meddling.  If they're going to accuse of we might as well make the most of it.
