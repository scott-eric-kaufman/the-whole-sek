## SUPREMELY IMPORTANT BREAKING NEWS FOR ACADEMICS!

Google apparently adopted a policy of not displaying links to [one particularly vindictive (and potentially career-damaging) site](http://www.google.com/search?q=site%!A(MISSING)http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.ratemyprofessors.com%!F(MISSING)+%!s(MISSING)cott+eric+kaufman%!)(MISSING), so the only way a search committee can learn how world-historically awful you are in the classroom from aggrieved anonymous students you had the _chutzpah_ to give the grades they deserved is if a member of that committee goes to [the aforementioned site](http://ratemyprofessors.com/) and performs a tedious sequence of delimiting queries designed to frustrate people with unlimited patience.  

Google may not always live up to [its stated gold standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%!t(MISSING)\_be\_evil), but in this case they seem to be supporting an uncommon good.  (Not that I have [anything to worry about](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=254703), potential future employers.  Even the aggrieved anonymous students I've had the _chutzpah_ to give the grades they richly deserved think I'm wonderful . . . except for the ones that don't.)  Which means that, in this respect, we are all now being made into this:

When I do a google search of myself by name, evilnastysite.com does actually show up in the results. I don't know why that search you did failed, but if you search for yourself sans middle name, evilnastysite.com results for you do come up in the first fifty hits.

Deciding on their own accord that certain sites are beyond the pale and not to be found via Google is not something I would call not being evil myself, no matter how annoying said site can be. Google is \_the\_ online gatekeeper and as such they have a huge responsibility in being open and transparant.

And actually, this post just shows your ineffectual liberal ivory tower disassociation from "the real world"[1], as doing the same search on "Scott Kaufman" finds you easily. 

False alarm then.

Ahistoricality, damn it.  Well, I hope people will search for the name I provide them, which includes the "Eric."  That said, it's still not pulling up my wife's ratings at all, so yay!

Martin, you're right about Google not not being evil, but I had hoped that it's a matter of the site's declining significance more than anything else.  Despite having taught more students this year than any year previous, I received no new reviews.

I had a couple of reviews this year, about par really. And the site's prominence in my search results seems higher over the last six months than ever. So I'm not writing any paeans to godgle yet....

And the moral of the story, "be careful what you write on the Internets" people.
