Over at [_Big Hollywood_](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/hfontova/2010/01/25/review-soderberghs-che-and-historical-accuracy/), a [man](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/author/hfontova) who only watched the first half of Steven Soderbergh's _Che_
declares the whole film a work of propaganda. You can tell he only
watched the first half because he thinks the whole film is about
Cuba—the second half, sometimes called _Guerilla_, covers events that took place in Bolivia and, more importantly, undercuts the romantic image of Che cultivated in _The Argentine_,
the part of the film devoted to the Cuban revolution. Did Soderbergh
omit the years between the Cuban and Bolivian insurgencies—years in
which Che grossly mismanaged the Cuban economy, openly insulted the
Soviet Union, and failed to exploit the revolutionary potential in the
Congo? He did; however, he did so for _narrative_ reasons, not political ones.
_Guerilla_
documents the abject failure of the great revolutionary to accomplish
anything in the Bolivian wilds. Che and his dwindling forces spend the
entire movie _walking in circles_—about an hour in, his forces are divided and compelled _to walk in circles looking for each other_,
as if their mothers never told them that should they become separated
from her at the mall, they should stay put and let her find them. The
already leisurely pace of _The Argentine_ slows to an appropriately Jarmuschian crawl, as it allows the viewer to realize that, as in [_Dead Man_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112817/),
the protagonist died in the first five minutes of the film and all this
pointless wandering through desolate lands is designed to get him to
understand as much. Anyone who watches the whole film would know this,
but then again, no one who had paid attention to either half of the
film would ever write:  
[I]n those two years of
“ferocious” battles, the total casualties on BOTH sides actually ran to
182. New Orleans has an annual murder rate DOUBLE that. The famous
“Battle of Santa Clara,” that Soderbergh depicts as a Caribbean
Stalingrad, claimed five casualties total—on BOTH sides.I'm
not touching the reference to New Orleans, and will instead focus on
the author's claim that Soderbergh filmed this battle like "a Caribbean
Stalingrad," _i.e._ as the equivalent of a battle in which an [estimated 2.7 million soldiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle\_of\_Stalingrad#Casualties) died, because _nearly every casualty in Soderbergh's film was an established character_.
If anything, the film creates the impression that eleven of Che's
closest friends were killed during the entire revolution. Then again,
I'm not even sure why I'm paying any attention to someone who would
write:  
Seems to me her tragic story makes ideal fodder
for Oprah, for all those women’s magazines, for all those butch
professorettes of “Women’s Studies,” for a Susan Sarandon or Sandra
Bullock role.Because honestly, if you write the phrase
"butch professorettes," you're clearly confused as to what stereotype
you're trying to convey: "These masculine fairies, I mean, feminine
meatheads, I mean—I mean—I mean." No sir, you mean no more than your
words signify, and they're all sound and fury.
