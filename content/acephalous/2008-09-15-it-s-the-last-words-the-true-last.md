## It's the last words, the true last.

When I shared the story of [my filing](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/i-tried-to-file.html), Rich [noticed](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/i-tried-to-file.html#comment-130241526) I'd included links to some of my more memorable posts like a person shuttering the windows before closing shop.  I considered it.  _Acephalous_ is, after all, a record of the final three years of my graduate career.  

They weren't good years.  

When the ledger closes they will likely stand as the worst three years of my life.  ([Summary](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/unbelievable-th.html).)  Some of that misery I brought on myself—anything having to do with anything online—but all of it flattened me as only perfect shit-storms can.  If I seemed to handle disaster well, it was only because my coping mechanism suits this medium.  

But my life hadn't always been [a drinking song](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/07/dear-university.html#comment-122778334).  

What began with random cancer simply snowballed.  For the past three years everything that could go wrong has done so spectacularly.  I'm only a [consummate storyteller](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/how-sek-hid-can.html#comment-93546406) because I've been given an obscene wealth of good material.  The sooner I put all this behind me the better.

So that was the end of _Acephalous_.  What began with anger should end with joy.  I have other places to punish random people with random thoughts and outstanding invitations to write elsewhere.  I don't need a place that reminds me daily of times most awful.  But _Acephalous_ is mine.  My voice.  All the terrible things I recorded here were written in a voice whose development can be tracked.  

When I began, my voice wafted contagious—when others smelled it, [they vomited too](http://mthollywood.blogspot.com/).  Now I'm almost willing own up to the fact that the words I inhabit belong to me.  That they have carried me to the threshold of my story since the door opened on my story.  

They almost say me.

So I'm not closing shop yet.  

I've only written 1,734 posts.  

I've only received 18,357 comments.  

I must go on.

"I can't go on" : "I'll go on" :: "I must go on" : ?

Or perhaps you didn't mean to suggest an analogy.

Anyway -- do go on.

Less of an analogy than an allusion.  Beckett's dismissal of the last bit is good enough for me.
