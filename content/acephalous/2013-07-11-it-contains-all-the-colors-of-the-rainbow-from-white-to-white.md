## It contains all the colors of the rainbow, from white to white.*

Before you laugh, you should know that intellectual heavyweights like [the Internet's own Jeff Goldstein](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=50041) are a crucial part of the movement to make ["North Colorado" the 51st state](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250\_162-57593080/could-north-colorado-be-americas-51st-state/). The movement's "willing to make our voices heard even while being labeled kooks  and 'fringe' elements," which is a good thing, since it sounds like something concocted by kooky fringe elements. Who are these people? Don't know. But according to Jeff they

> represent a growing number of contiguous outlying counties that  surround the Denver/Boulder doughnut hole owned by the hipsters and  Democrats, and the many out-of-state (and illegally out-of-country)  imports who have taken over Colorado government, at least for the time  being[.]

I wonder what those counties have in common? [Let me see now](http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/maps/colorado\_map.html):

*   Kit Carson - 94.8 percent white
*   Logan - 92.2 percent white
*   Morgan - 92.8 percent white
*   Phillips - 96.9 percent white
*   Sedgewick - 96.0 percent white
*   Washington - 96.2 percent white
*   Weld - 93.4 percent white
*   Yuma - 97.5 percent white

They "represent" a group wants to form a state that will be _on average_ 94.94 percent white. They specifically want to exclude urban areas like Denver County, which threatens their Great White Fever Dream with its 10.4 percent blackness. Not that their desire for a white state prevents them from [explicitly comparing their plight to the Civil Rights Movement](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=50025#comment-1001538). Except if you scroll down, you'll see that their new white state will require that "the streets run with blood like we've never seen before." (That sounds ominous until you remember how low a benchmark that is for shut-ins like these.) So it'll be _just like_ the Civil Rights Movement, only with lots of guns and violence. I bet Jeff's sitting at home right now thinking about rolling naked on the floor -- I mean _grappling_ -- and choking the life from some dusky liberal relativist.  Because there's nothing racist about wanting to create a white state if it's just an accident of ideology that everyone invested in its creation is white. Unrelatedly:

I am in no way disagreeing with your argument, but I'd like to be a little pedantic, since these numbers piqued my curiosity.

To get a more acurate measure of demographics, I weighed the percentages of whites by the populations of the counties.

Weld County's 258,638 people pretty much dwarfs the others, and the total white percentage of 'North Colorado' ends up at 93.53%, which is still noticably higher than the 88.1% figure for Colorado as a whole.

As it turns out, North Colorado would have a lower percentage of whites than Idaho (93.8%), West Virginia (94.0%), New Hampshire (94.4%), Maine (95.3%) and Vermont (95.4%). (All as of 2012).

Another issue - the county links from your link are broken so I can't tell for sure, but from "the spreadsheets here", it strongly looks like those percentages are white-including-Hispanic. If you exclude Hispanic you get:

Kit Carson - 76.4 percent   

Logan - 78.1 percent   

Morgan - 61.7 percent   

Phillips - 79.4 percent   

Sedgwick - 85.6 percent   

Washington - 89.5 percent   

Weld - 67.6 percent   

Yuma - 77.9 percent 

And the whole of Colorado is 70.01% (Although Denver County is 52.2%.)

That's for the category listed at the top, "White alone," so I don't think it includes Hispanics.

Sorry for the broken link. That was supposed to be to [http://dola.colorado.gov/dlg/demog/2010censusdata.html](http://dola.colorado.gov/dlg/demog/2010censusdata.html).

And no, I think "White alone" means "white with no other qualifications." Looking at [http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/08/08123.html](http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/08/08123.html) for Weld, "White alone" is 93.4%, but "Hispanic or Latino" (presumably of any race) is 28.3%, so it's impossible for it to be white non-Hispanic.
