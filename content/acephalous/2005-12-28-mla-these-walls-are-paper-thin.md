## MLA: These Walls Are Paper-Thin

The couple in the adjacent room have been alternating between loud recitations of “What Theorist X said” and _extremely_ loud arguments about how one or the other has confused Theorist Y with Z _for
the fifth fucking time in a hour almost like you don’t even want this
job we paid $1,000 for the privilege of being interviewed for_.

It now occurs to me that I should have 1) knocked on their door and asked them to keep it down or 2) kicked the wall and demanded they keep it down or 3) tattled.    
What time do these job interviews start anyway?  8:00 a.m.?  I could squeeze in an hour before McLemee's panel.  Isn't everybody finished interviewing everybody else by Wednesday afternoon?  Or at least the early evening?  Aren't the odds that these two will be at this another night slim?  No?  

Humor me.

You told us you're deaf. Was that silliness? Or how do you lip read through walls? (and are you ever in the room with Clark Kent at the same time?)

They were screaming _that loud_.  Also throwing things, it felt like.  All's quiet tonight though, so I may yet recover from my first all-nighter in years.

Interviews go on all week! Some schools might be interviewing 15+ people for a single position, and they can end up dragging out over several days.

Last year at the MLA, while my wife and I didn't fight in our hotel room, she did (reportedly) cry profusely through my first interview. Right from the moment I left the room, all suited up in my fancy Men's Wearhouse suit. 

It's that stressful - even for spouses.
