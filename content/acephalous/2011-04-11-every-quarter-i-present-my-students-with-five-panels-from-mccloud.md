...and have them compete to see who can come up with the most hilarious narrative.  Here are the panels:

[![Mccloud exercise - 01](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3ff5f4a970b-500wi "Mccloud exercise - 01")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3ff5f4a970b-popup)   
They need to add narration or dialogue (or both), as well as specify what the word-picture relations are and how the transitions between the panels work.  Every quarter I learn a little something about my students with this exercise, and this quarter is no exception: I've learned that they're either high, horny, heart-broken, violent, menstruating or some combination thereof.  Should be a fun class tomorrow.

hard to do formatting here, so excuse the lack thereof:

PANEL 1 - SUE (CAPTION): I remember the early winter rains in west Texas, growing up.

PANEL 2 - SUE (CAPTION): The cows would skirt the trees, and tuck their heads.

PANEL 3 - SUE (CAPTION): The water a wall, feeling cut off  

          SUE (CAPTION): but connected to something bigger.

PANEL 4 - SUE (CAPTION): I'd open upward to the sky

PANEL 5 - SUE (CAPTION): The droplets a sacrament.

On the nose, sure, but that's 5 minutes tops.

Oops.  Didn't read the word hilarious.

Next time, I'll do something more violently menstrual.
