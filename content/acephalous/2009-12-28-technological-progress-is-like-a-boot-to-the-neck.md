			What would my dissertation have looked like [were this a reality](http://io9.com/5423338/a-device-that-lets-you-type-with-your-mind)?  Something like this: 
Jack London claimed that and do I really want to start a sentence with the name of the author crap I'm quote unquote typing all this so yes comma insert comma insert comma fuck it so Jack London claimed that and I'm going to have to delete all this shit meaning it certainly isn't saving me any time fuck I'm going to have to delete that too period period caps lock period stop you fucker fine no commas no periods we can write this like Gertrude I always loved that bit in everybody's autobiography and shit is this thing still typing why yes it is asshole and it'll continue to so long as you think stop thinking and how do you do a period in this thing? Hey look a question mark I made a question mark now how do I make a comma? Hey look another question mark I guess I understand questions better than answers and what are you trying to tell me you fucking machine?That's simulated, of course, but devastatingly accurate nonetheless.

Apparently your brain is unable to access either the shift or delete keys: a new form of mental disability has been discovered! Or maybe they just need to go back in and jiggle the electrodes, which sounds uncomfortable.

Modern science has only just begun to plumb the limitations of my brain.

If they could install a spell checker, I'm in!

This is why I don't predict neural-interface cars/planes/giant mecha becoming a reality any time soon.

I picture dozens of police mecha standing at ready trying not to pick their noses, scratch their balls, or fall asleep on their feet as the protesters prepare to riot.

You should take lessons on training your mind from Molly Bloom. Just saying...
