## Tomorrow, I Teach

No _Cerebus_ tonight, as I'm irrationally annoyed at how lethargically my Stone Age scanner scans.  It's not like I have anything better to do, what with being unemployed and all.  Except!

I'm not sure that deserved an exclamation, but roll with me.  Except!  I'm subbing for a friend tomorrow.  

In a poetry class.  

"But Scott," you're thinking, "time and again you've mentioned how little poetry you've read, and how you don't even know that much about it."  

True enough.  Except!  Guess which poem I'll be teaching tomorrow?  

Of all the poems in all the world, guess which one my friend happened to need someone to teach tomorrow?

Couldn't figure it out?  Good Lord, people, it's not like I'm qualified to teach more than [one poem](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/closereading\_ex.html).

My condolences. I would not wish the tragic Mr. Keats and his jug on even a 'conservative critic.'

I think we all keep those in our back pocket.  My one poem is "The Waste Land."

When I open the 'bookmarks bar' on Safari, I see:  **Acephalous: Close-Reading ...eats' "Ode on a Grecian Urn"**
