## Back to Graduate School in Five, Four, Three (<em>flashes two fingers, retracts one, then the other</em>)

Four people in four different offices have assured me that as of midnight tonight, I'll be a graduate student again.  Granted, four different people in four different offices assured me that everything related to the library had been settled ... but I choose to believe the four people I talked to today, because I am an optimist.  

I want to thank all the good folk here and elsewhere for [the](http://waxbanks.typepad.com/blog/2007/12/talkin-stupid-r.html) [sympathy](http://foothillsofconfusion.blogspot.com/2007/12/few-good-links.html) and [sound](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week\_2007\_12\_09.html#007917) [advice](http://lawandletters.blogspot.com/2007/12/isnt-there-some-denial-of-due-process.html).  Contrary to what [some people think](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/comments\_7917.html#714379), not curling fetal and muttering nonsense says nothing about my manliness and everything about my utter resignation to absurdity.  When [Sisyphus](http://academiccog.blogspot.com/) [wrote](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/unbelievable-th.html#comment-93291704) 
I'd tell you to cheer up, that there's always a light at the end of the tunnel, but I'd worry that in
your case it would only mean that there was an oncoming train.

I laughed and realized that the perverse optimism that keeps me upright instead of fetal remains intact [despite it all](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/unbelievable-th.html).  This stubborn resistance to the empirical fact of my karmic debt likely means I'll one day turn Republican.  

So be it.  

In the meantime, I'll watch [the fourth season](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QXDJLI/diesekoschmar-20) of _The Wire_ secure in the knowledge that Michael, Randy, Duquan and Namond will all survive unscathed.  ([Speaking of Namond](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/unbelievable-th.html#comment-93263664) ... )

Glad to hear this! If it doesn't work out, the emails I forwarded you had a lot of good advice. 

Confidentially though, I think by now a lot of my law prof friends are getting used to emails with the subject "request for non-legal legal advice", and presume that it will be about you.  Try to stay about of trouble from now on!  Oh wait, trouble seeks you.  One day there will be a website called "Scott Eric Kaufman Facts"

Fact 1:  In the dictionary under "absurdity" you'll find a picture of SEK.

Fact 2:  Those fires in Orange County weren't accidental..they were old fashioned fire and brimstone, courtesy of SEK's non-loving god.

Etc., etc. You'll be the academic Chuck Norris.

Scott... holy crap. 

I recently had an electronic notice come through for three items I returned to the library in August. They came on two separate days. Turns out whoever checked them back in never scanned them, just put them on the shelves. It was really no big deal at all and a singularly boring story, but now after reading all this I feel something like I dodged a bullet. 

Good luck w/ everything, I hope it works out ASAP.

take care,  

Nate

ps- let's talk about how great history is sometime.

If I ever get the chance, I'm going to buy you a beer.

Your pleas did not fall on deaf or unsympathetic ears. On this day of my diversification into a state-of-the-art telemedicine center, I am granting boons. One day, I may very well need you to return the favor. Capish?

(P.S. Good luck with the health insurance).
