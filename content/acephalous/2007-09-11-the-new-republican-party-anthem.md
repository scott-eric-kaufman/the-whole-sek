## The New Republican Party Anthem?

Eating lunch, I flipped from _MSNBC_ reporting on Larry Craig's airport adventure to _Headline News_ covering recidivism in "[cured](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted\_Haggard)" hom**o**sexuals to _VH1_ playing something by The Mamas and the Papas. 

Now I'm humming:

So kiss me and smile for me,  
Tell me that you wait for me,  
Hold me, like you never let me go.  
'Cause I'm leaving on a het plane,

Don't know when I'll be back again,

Oh babe I hate to go ...

Minor correction:  "Leaving on a Jet Plane" actually sung by Peter, Paul and Mary.

Branwell, John Denver wrote it, and everyone covered it ... including Peter, Paul and Mary, Janis Joplin, &c.

I'm assuming 'het' as a sophisticated gag about heterosexuality as the ideal flight that can carry us away from all this messy groundliving.  On the other hand, the lack of the second 'o' in 'homsexuals' baffles me.

Do people actually leave on 'jet planes' any more? A _jet_ plane? As opposed to a biplane? Spin the propeller? And why do they leave on jet planes and don't return again? Isn't that suspicious, buying one-way tickets? Doesn't Home Land Security flag that kind of behavior? And do men or women really "wait" for those who fuck around on them? And what does it mean, this waiting? For what? 

It's all very confusing, and I'm sure I don't understand. And I haven't even gotten to the 'homsexual' part of it.

Oh! I see! _Het_ plane. 

Um. Never mind.

Corrected!  Also, "het" is slang in the queer/transgendered community for, well, you know.

OHISEE, never has a pseudonym been put to such good use as yours has here.  Bravo, my good man, bravo.
