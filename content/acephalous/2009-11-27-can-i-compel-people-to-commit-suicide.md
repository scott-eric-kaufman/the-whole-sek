Seems that, at least in the virtual sense, [I can](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15557#comment-820063).  You'll note, of course, that this is the same person who [called me haughty](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15337#comment-789144) the last time I [noted](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/conservatives-are-outraged-over-an-actual-outrage-color-me-impressed.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5f0adbb970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5f0adbb970c) that he can't quit me, but the fact of the matter is, _he can't quit me_.  It seems like every time he deigns to comment on his own site, he [mentions me by name](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15557#comment-820038):

I kept warning everyone. I expect this of the Left. It’s what their worldview inevitably leads to. Who’s to blame here is those on the “right” who not only didn’t try to stop it, but who aided it, however tacitly, in exchange for blog hits and pats on the back from moral frauds like SEK.

There are many moral frauds in the world, and yet when forced to name one, who does he name?  I only ask as a preface to a larger point: over at that place and [the other one I formerly frequented](http://patterico.com/), there's this [meme](http://patterico.com/2009/09/21/breitbarts-next-news-drop-the-nea-the-white-house-the-lies-and-the-cover-up/#comment-556671) straight out of [_Stardust Memories_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0792846125/diesekoschmar-20) in which commenters note their preference for the early, funny me.  What they never acknowledge—likely because they fail to realize—is that I'm not the one who changed.

They did.

From the moment it became apparent that conservatives might be on the wrong side of a national referendum, my voice ceased being that of a rational dissident and became, to their ears, a harsh reminder of the coming impotence.  So long as they were safely ensconsed in power, they were more than happy to humor dissent.  They would debate vigorously, but charitably, because they went to sleep secure in the knowledge that their arguments were subtending policy.  Once they realized that would no longer be the case, they could no more humor me than stop the puddles around their feet from expanding.  How could they be charitable to someone who lukewarmly supports a candidate set on destroying all they hold dear?

Short a very few exceptions, they could not.

One day I was one on the witty snarkers over at PW and then I raised my hand to disagree.  Rational disagreements escalated to my shit-blasting their continually intensifying creep-fiction memes.  I succumbed to actual gloating pride for my understanding of Marxist ideology and related Lit theory.  And to think there was a time when I thought reading Marx wasn't all that necessary.      

Obama delivered on his promise of Change alright.

Goldstein has come out of hiding once again to con people into sending him money.

Extra whining this time.

What are the odds you think he'll blame me for something in that thread?  (I hope you answered "[pretty damn likely](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15561#comment-820853)," for I'm the root of all that's wrong with the world today.  Mr. Powerful Me, who rules over the Internets with an iron fist!)

Some wingnuts just can't handle being in the wilderness.

I like the holding his prose hostage from the rubes.  

I wonder he considered a far more lucrative venture:  offering to accept money to NOT write silly 6000 word pieces with 75 parentheticals about disgraced literary theroies in a style which allegedly made William Faulkner's ghost retire after ten minutes muttering "enough already."

I mean that's the way for him to cash in.  Hush money would make him a millionaire.  And make happyfeet cry.  

It's double good.

A few days ago I lamented how the simpleton Darleen had ruined his place. After reading his tortured "I'm not a racist because I say I am and you are because you say someone else is" I realize Darleen and Jeff may be the same person.
