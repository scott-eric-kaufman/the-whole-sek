## The Pedagogical Imperative

Those who can do, do.  Those who can't do, teach.

Those who can't teach, well, they agree to [guest post](http://proteinwisdom.com/index.php?/weblog/entry/21008/) on [conservative blogs](http://proteinwisdom.com/).  (About liberals in academia, no less.)

Why?  Because writing for a hostile audience—or, more accurately, writing for an audience you assume will be hostile—closely resembles walking into a classroom and informing students they'll be re-reading _Huck Finn_.  

Speaking of which, that's one of the topics I'll be addressing while there.  Re-reading _Huck Finn_, that is.  Why?  Some fool devotes a chapter to it in [his new book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393060373/diesekoschmar-20) ...

[Since PW's servers can't parse liberal guests posts, I've included the text of mine below the fold.]

Pot, Kettle, Black and All That [Scott a.k.a. “The Token Lefty"]

_For some reason, Jeff thought having me blog here wouldn’t be a terrible idea.  I hope to make him rue that decision.  Not **rue**
rue, mind you, just a little.  I’ll be concentrating my posts on two
books which deal with multiculturalism in contemporary academia and
American society.  Each is brilliant in its own way, and each deserves
a fair hearing.  The first is [Michael Bérubé](http://www.michaelberube.com/)‘s [**What’s Liberal about the Liberal Arts?**](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393060373/diesekoschmar-20); the second, Walter Benn Michaels’ [**The Trouble with Diversity**](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/080507841X/diesekoschmar-20).  Who am I?  My name’s [Scott](http://acephalous.typepad.com/).  Want to know more about me?  Read [my greatest hits](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/09/the\_best\_of\_ace.html)._

That said, I composed something which has absolutely nothing to do with
either book this afternoon.  You see, I thought it’d be nice to
introduce myself via a rational examination of a [clearly irrational argument](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2006/09/bill-clinton-lunching-with-bloggers.html).  Looks like I was wrong:

So you’ve all seen [the infamous photo](http://flickr.com/photo\_zoom.gne?id=243422784&size=l), right?  If not, click on it.  Finished?  What did you see?  _I_ saw an awkward group portrait.  Not nearly so graceful as, say, [this one](http://flickr.com/photos/robalan/244686172/).  Or [this one](http://flickr.com/photos/lambchops/997156/).  Or [this one](http://flickr.com/photo\_zoom.gne?id=116883368&size=o), either.  It’s _almost_ as if the photo [Ann](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2006/09/bill-clinton-lunching-with-bloggers.html) [Althouse](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2006/09/lets-take-closer-look-at-those-breasts.html) considers evidence of feminism’s death _wasn’t_
a carefully orchestrated moment captured by a professional photographer
to commemorate the happiest moment in a young couple’s life, but a
hastily assembled photo op in which a bunch of amateur photographers
told him to stand over there, yes, and her to, no, no, not there, in
the first row, now, yes, over _there_, look here, thanks.

_**Click.  Click click.  Click click click click click.**_

This confusion, well, it confuses Althouse.  [To wit](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2006/09/bill-clinton-lunching-with-bloggers.html#115833980447019067):

I’m judging you [Jessica] by your apparent behavior. It’s
not about the smiling, but the three-quarter pose and related
posturing, the sort of thing people razz Katherine Harris about. I
really don’t know why people who care about feminism don’t have any
edge against Clinton for the harm he did to the cause of taking sexual
harrassment seriously, and posing in front of him like that irks me, as
a feminist.

That second point?  Beyond reproach.  Feminists can and do have
reservations about sharing a conference table with someone with
Clinton’s reputation.  But the first one?  Remember all the sluts in
the wedding photos?  The ones who stood up straight, turned a little to
their left or right and smiled for the camera?  You remember them, _the sluts_.  _They were sluts_.  What do you mean they look like women “posing” in a group photo?  _Of course they do._  That’s the problem.  _That’s what makes them sluts_.

As I read [Melissa’s post](http://proteinwisdom.com/index.php?/weblog/entry/21001/), I realized how wrong I’d been.  Apparently, it is _not_
the belief of rational individuals that Althouse confused her hatred of
Clinton for the conventions of group portraiture.  Turns out rational
people like Melissa believe the left—the monolithic them_s_ and they_s_ peppering her rant—betray a pernicious hypocrisy by, get this, _participating in the American political system_.  Can you believe the _nerve_
of these lefties?  Forming coalitions of convenience, which their
counterparts on the right haven’t done since the economic conservatives
broke from the Christian fundamentalists—_Wait_, that never happened.  Seems the right fancies this commonplace of American politics as much as the left.  

Now, I know writing intelligent criticism is difficult—look at how
rarely you read any these days—but broadsides drawing attention away
from what you’re doing by pointing out that your opponent’s doing it
too are bound to backfire.  Which brings me to Glenn Reynold’s ironic
condemnation of partisan politics:

It’s all about supporting the right people politically, even if it turns you into a groper’s support group.

Yes, Mr. Reynolds, I would say.  _Exactly_.  Such is the nature of representative democracy: no single candidate will ever reflect _all_ of your personal beliefs to your satisfaction.  (That’s why they call it a _representative_ democracy instead of a _reflective_ one.)  You have to choose the one who _best_
represents the majority of them.  Sometimes that decision is mildly
unpleasant; others, it is decidedly so; last November, you lose weeks
to the thought that you may be forced to vote for John Kerry.  But you
know what?

You can either act like a responsible adult and admit that this
defect is built into the system; or, like Mr. Reynolds, you can hope
your audience forgets about that and rides your high-handed rhetoric to
ideological complacency.  Because believing your opponents are the only
ones whose politicians are, well, _politicians_ is not a sign of intelligence, but unthinking complacency.

Apparently protein wisdom's server can't parse liberal guest posts, if that's what **Internal Server Error 500** means, and I think it might.

No, there was a time when the thing went ka-boom, and the blogging software had to be reloaded.
