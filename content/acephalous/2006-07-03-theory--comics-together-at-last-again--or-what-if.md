Passage from a letter excerpted in Ernest Jone's _The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud_ (3:392):
If I had my life to live over again, I should devote myself to telepathy rather than to psychoanalysis.

Do you mean, "nice" like "sweet"?  "Super-sweet"?  Or "Blah blah blah, you're a nice guy, blah blah blah"?

Well[,](http://www.brokencredit.com) I think we can all agree that Freud has some strange views[;](http://www.brokencredit.com) but[,](http://www.brokencredit.com) I believe that debates are tough enough as they are[!](http://www.brokencredit.com)

Wendy, what a sad attempt at spam.  I mean, you should _at least_ put the links to words.  It took me a couple of seconds to center the cursor over punctuation marks, much less click on the link "brokencredit."  (If I'd been inclined to do so, that is.)
