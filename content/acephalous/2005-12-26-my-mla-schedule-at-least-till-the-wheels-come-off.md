## My MLA Schedule (At Least Till The Wheels Come Off)

This schedule is as tentative as it is idiosyncratic.  Some panels I'm attending for the speakers, others for how they speak to general theoretical issues of interest, and the rest because they may do my dissertation some good.  I'm not attending all the panels I'd like to . . . and I doubt I'll be able to attend all the panels I've listed here.  I hear the whispers insisting I'll burn out.  I figure if I post this here as a challenge to myself the odds of my being insanely responsible jump a good 389 percent.  The schedule:
