_SEK is drives to HIS IN-LAW’S to check something on the Internet before heading to Baton Rouge to reclaim all his worldly possessions from THE AWESOME HISPANIC MOVERS._

_Having survived THE ROAD, SEK arrives in Baton Rouge. However, somewhere between California and Louisiana, the AWESOME HISPANIC MOVERS became GIANT ANGRY TATTOOED BELARUSIANS_.

> **GIANT ANGRY TATTOOED BELARUSIANS:** Please to be sure. For two hundred we walk on grass even.

_SEK then is to be unloading a U-Haul by his lonesome, waiting for VERY STRONG GODCHILD and HIS VERY STRONG GODCHILD’S BROTHER to make finish with swim practice and become UNPAID CHILD LABORERS._

Let's try this from work. 

The first part of that reminds me of Bryan Bowers' rendition of [Dem Deer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AARQm3kiCE).

Jonathan, that was great -- duly forwarded to friends and family. Growing up on the opposite end of the Mississippi from SEK, I can say there's easily as many deer in the road, but I can't speak to relative belligerence. My mother-in-law encountered a similar situation as SEK, had to stop her car, honked her horn, and a buck kicked out our headlight. Then they took their time wandering off the road. 

Dem deer.

That is great, Jonathan. And since neither of y'all do Facebook, I should share my experience the next day:

I was delayed on my way to work this morning by a mob of GIANT FLIGHTLESS BIRDS. The road was full of emus.

Mississippi is just fucking with me now.

My wife later informed me that they're _feral emu_ who escaped from a farm down the road years ago and multiplied prodigiously. _I know!_

I do Facebook -- about once a month, for a minute or two, whether I need to or not.

Feral emus; I'm not surprised by the emus, but the "feral" is interesting. I suppose there's no real natural predators to keep them in check. Just wait; feral emus will become the Australian cane toad of Louisiana. 

On the other end of the river, I've seen emu, ostrich, and zebra, among other exotics on farms (miniature ponies can be as aggressive as they are adorable). I don't live there anymore, but coming across a herd of feral zebra in Minnesota or Wisconsin would really make my day.

Every now and then an alligator from your end of the river hitches a ride on a barge and gets hauled in by someone trying to catch bass or walleye. That always puts the water skiers on edge, while the fisherman secretly hope a stray gator gets a fallen skier.

Feral Emu.

Well, that puts the [free-range fighting cocks of Hawaii](http://thedresners.blogspot.com/2006/10/stretching-my-lens.html) in perspective. They may have crowed all day and all night (dawn? a myth, at least where there are streetlights) but they couldn't kill you unless you tried to eat them.
