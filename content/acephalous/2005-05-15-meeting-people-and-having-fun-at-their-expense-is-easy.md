_Dear A. Cephalous,  

When you're not too busy reading Janet Browne's new biography of Darwin, working on your beast of a Jack London chapter, answering student emails or spending time with the lovely and talented Little Womedievalist, what do you do?  

Best,  

Susie Hornisflopper****_

**A. Cephalous replies:**

Dear Ms. Hornisflopper,

In addition to the aforementioned activities, I enjoy long walks on the beach, drinking wine with and tequila off friends, listening to classic Lionel Ritchie albums in front of roaring fires[\*](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/meeting\_people\_.html#more) and prodding [self-idolaters](http://mthollywood.blogspot.com/) into increasingly delusional [declarations of their own importance](http://objector.typepad.com/objections/2005/05/mischievous\_pos.html).Â  

Best,

A. Cephalous, N.B.

I hope you're at least having some fun taking apart that buffoon, A. C.  Because he's surely not worth your efforts.  Apart from being a churl and a conspiracy theorist, the guy is just not that bright.  Your wit is wasted on him.
