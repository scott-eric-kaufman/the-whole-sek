## This isn’t even good nonsense. It’s insufferable.*

(_[X-posted](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/11/this-isnt-even-good-nonsense-its-insufferable/)._)

On this day in 1930, the only man to [ingest every major work ever written](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/im\_almost\_tempted\_to\_believe\_him/) and survive, Harold Bloom, was born.  His feats of [speed and memorization](http://209.85.141.104/search?q=cache:uiJ32F\_2FQkJ:www2.arnes.si/%!E(MISSING)bjason/CANON.doc+%!H(MISSING)e+had+that+extraordinary+ability+to+read+a+book+almost+as+fast+as+you+can+turn+the+pages,+not+only+to+read+it+but+to+practically+memorize+it.%!&(MISSING)hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&lr=lang\_en&client=firefox-a)
are legend, but even most literary scholars are unaware that not only
has he consumed the entire Western Canon, he has written a magisterial
tome about _each and every item contained therein_.  

In an April interview concerning the three-month lag between the publication of Thomas Pynchon’s [_Against the Day_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0143112562/diesekoschmar-20) and [his anxious, Gnostic appreciation of it](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1555460623/diesekoschmar-20),
Bloom confessed he finds it “increasingly difficult to remain abreast
of major works of late because so many of them suck balls.” Asked to
clarify, Bloom refused to mince words: “When I declared [this](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061120057/diesekoschmar-20) the best novel in the history of ever, I must have been asleep.  It wouldn’t be the first book I’ve composed thus.”

When reached for comment, John Crowley was found on the floor
weeping uncontrollably. His agent, Richard Cummings, on a stepladder in
the hall affixing a noose to the ceiling fan, was also unavailable for
comment.

Shorter Bloom:  

"Stupid reading public, they suck.  How I hate them."

Bloom's turned against Crowley?  I did hear that an intro he recently wrote for an anniversary edition of _L,B_ had been rejected by the editor . . .
