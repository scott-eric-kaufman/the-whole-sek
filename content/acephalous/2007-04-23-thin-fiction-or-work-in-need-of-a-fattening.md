## Thin Fiction; or, Work in Need of a Fattening

When not busy book-eventing, I've spent my time reacquainting myself with Jack London.  Not just any Jack London, either, but _my_ Jack London.  The imagined one yearning to be nonfictional.  Created through careful research—biographies, source studies, secondary readings, &c.—my Jack London never breathed, never learned, never loved.  He exists so that I might write a dissertation chapter about him.  As soon as I stop writing and people stop reading my chapter, he will cease to exist.  I am not, as Greenblatt would have it, speaking for the dead or making them speak. 

I am conjuring the dead, not from some eternal repose, but _ex nihilo_.  Would my Jack London have thought the things his counterpart did?  Perhaps.  They share many formative experiences.  They lived at the same time, in the same places, with the same people.  They frequented the same bars and bordellos, and as a result likely died of the same liver failure and/or sexually transmitted disease.   Still, reading the notes I took and the fragments of aborted chapters, I feel estranged.  My Jack London seem gossamer-thick on the page, related to the other one, certainly, but in a dysfunctional family way.

I'll soldier on—I would be working on it now, were I not waiting for linen to dry—but until my Jack London gains some weight, I'll do so warily.  The other Jack London probably couldn't remember all the names of all the characters in all his novels either, right?

According to [Miles Coverdale](http://www.eldritchpress.org/nh/br09.html):

IT IS NOT, I apprehend, a healthy kind of mental occupation, to devote ourselves too exclusively to the study of individual men and women. If the person under examination be one's self, the result is pretty certain to be diseased action of the heart, almost before we can snatch a second glance. Or, if we take the freedom to put a friend under our microscope, we thereby insulate him from many of his true relations, magnify his peculiarities, inevitably tear him into parts, and, of course, patch him very clumsily together again. What wonder, then, should we be frightened by the aspect of a monster, which, after all--though we can point to every feature of his deformity in the real personage--may be said to have been created mainly by ourselves!

If you're _going_ to create a classic American prose writer _ex nihilo_, might I suggest that you call him something other than Jack _London_?  Jack Newyork has a nice ring.  Jack Chicago.  You could even, if you really wanted to, call him Jack Griffith Chaney, after the town of Griffith-Chaney in Idaho.  Or something.

_Would my Jack London have thought the things his counterpart did?_ 

No.

Tread carefully, lest you become another Orson Scott Card.
