## I have just finished this and now I do want to die

You might be thinking [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/06/kill-me-hard-un.html) is a theme.  

It isn't.  

But I _have_ just finished [this](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1560979151/diesekoschmar-20) and now I _do_ want to die.

It's brilliant.  

Excellent addition to the families-falling-apart genre.  

About which it seems I've never written.  

Which is odd.  

Because I know I have.

Only I haven't.

[_Ulysses_ is but one example of this despised genre](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/06/today-in-histor.html).  

Books and films which also belong to it include:

1.  _The Ice Storm_
2.  _The Myth of Fingerprints_
3.  _Kicking and Screaming_
4.  _What Happened To Us In The Dark_5.  _The Terrible Secret We Only Half-Remember But Made A Pact Never To Speak Of Again Or Else_
6.  _Summer Camp_
7.  _What He Built In There_
8.  _Neighbors Might Be People Too But_9.  _How Mom Ignored Us Because She Liked To Guzzle The Booze Like I Like To Eat Free Candy And How It Ruined Our One Last Shot At Happiness With An Unattainable Woman Who Would Have Left Us For Mr. Hot Shit In A Week Anyhow_

But you can't tell the pre-digression [it](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1560979151/diesekoschmar-20) (again for the lazy) is brilliant from [this excerpt](http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/06/what\_is\_dash\_shaws\_vision\_for.html) because it (being the excerpt) lacks the clues required to decode [this](http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/entertainment/08/06/13\_bottomlessbelly\_10\_lg.jpg).

_because it (being the excerpt) lacks the clues required to decode this_

Except, of course, that it doesn't.  It's a straight forward cryptogram, thus not requiring any extra clues, and it doesn't even have any of the promised spelling mistakes to throw one off.  Thanks for not spoiling the fun of solving it though.

The book looks good, if bleak (maybe not Chris Ware bleak, but still).  Our library doesn't seem to have it, so I'll have to pursue other means.
