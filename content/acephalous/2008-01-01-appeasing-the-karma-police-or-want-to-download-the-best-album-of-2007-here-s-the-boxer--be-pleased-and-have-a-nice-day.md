Since [friends](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/karma-to-kill-d.html) who [are not me](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/karma-to-kill-d.html#comment-95456228) have had such luck with having their brilliance recognized, I'm thinking some karmic augmentation might be in order.  So here is _[hands down](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/win-hands-down.html)_ the [best album of 2007](http://acephalous.typepad.com/thenational\_boxer.rar).\*

Enjoy.

(Ye Gods take note.  I'm here for strangers.  What more can you want from me?)

\*Bless you, Hunter S. Thompson, for teaching me what that meant.   It'd bothered me my entire life, and had the Kentucky Derby been [less decadent and depraved](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj20/2005/10/for\_friday\_14\_o.html#more), I'd have been annoyed to this day.  Also, the first person who notes that some lame "professional" blogger reminded me of this yesterday spends tomorrow French-kissing Chemical Billy.

Wait, how'd I do that?

_The National? Best LP of 2007? Really? Hrmph._

It's certainly _my_ favorite record of the year.  What's not to love?  It's like Nick Cave and [Jemaine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fycGFGSeKpc&feature=related) had a child.  Who wouldn't love that?

Hippies, Nazis, and Jonah Goldberg, that's who.

I was expecting a zip file so I just clicked on it (instead of right click and save). Seems this is not a good idea with Firefox. Oops... But I've done it the right way second time and I'm looking forward to listening to the album. Happy New Year!

Wow, this was only 3 months ago? I thought it was longer than that. Anyway, That's sort of relevant to what I wanted to say; some albums grow on you quite slowly, but then you feel as though you've known them forever. I probably wouldn't have gone out and bought it (I distinctly remember listening to a couple of tracks at the band's website ages ago, after reading about them and thinking, what's the fuss about?), but here I am listening to it yet again this evening and thought I really ought to take the time to come back and thank Scott for taking the trouble to put it up here. It really is a great album.
