... but I'm reading Tezuka's naturalist/Faulknerian account of post-WWII Japan and I can't stop thinking about the mid-century love of [axial cuts](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/?p=6136) for a reason which would be apparent if I had a scanner ready-to-hand, but as I don't, this post will serve as a placeholder.  

(In case you're wondering, I'm going to be [a little lost without delicious](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fasterforward/2010/12/yahoo.html), so there may be a few more posts of this sort until I find a proper replacement.  Apologies in advance.)

**UPDATE:** [Happy happy joy joy](http://blog.delicious.com/).

As a replacement for delicious, maybe this?

I haven't actually tried it.
