[_[X-posted](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the\_end\_of\_the\_valve/).  FYI: This is written in the spirit of [yesterday](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/hernandez\_comme.html)'s "misogynistic" post._]

The vibe around [The Valve] has been terrible of late.  Dismissive.  Drained, nay! _desanguified_.  Why?  An unhealthy percentage of our readership responds rigidly and unthinkingly to what we publish.  Constitutionally incapable of actual research, this lot prefers to think intuitively.  They are frequently hostile, with bitter and ill-tempered dispositions.  They flap their corrosive tongues in an attempt to dominate conversation.  

You heard me, ladies, I'm calling you out.  I learned all about you in an article I read today:

Intellectual activities unsex a woman, and she pays a high price for her intellectual life.  As a result, she is prone to all sorts of nervous disorders and may become severely maladjusted.  There is little hope she will marry, and, in a few cases, her intellectual activities are said to make her frigid.  In any case, intellectual activities seem to make some women cold and lacking in human warmth.

Of course, that only applies to our _unattractive_ female readership, as the rare "hottie" (as the kids say) isn't even "credible to many, and ingenious explanations are necessary to accont for her scholarly interests.  Usually the explanation is some type of early psychological experience."  

"Unattractive women," however, "are perfectly credible as scholars and their interests in intellectual activities do not require any explanation."  Better unspeakably traumatized than unattractive, as "no greater misfortune can befall a woman than to be physically unattractive, and this misfortune of physical unattractiveness warps her soul and makes her a spiteful creature."
