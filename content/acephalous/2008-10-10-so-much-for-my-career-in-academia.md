## So much for my career in academia...

Today is the final day students can register for classes.  I get email.\*
I did not attend the second class and was supposed to be dropped automatically due to
the second day rule, but I have to officially drop the course with your
signature.  When are you on campus today?

This student is gently reminded that I told the class on the first day
that the second day rule is not automatic, informed that I will
not be on campus today and directed to the composition office.  I get more email:
I was wondering if there was any room in your 39B class from 9:30-10:50 a.m.  I've been trying to get into a class and it seems like they're completely full!

This student is politely informed that I only allow two unexcused absences per quarter, and that because my class has already met four times, it would be impossible for her to earn a passing grade.  I get even more email:
i need to add ur class wheres ur office so u can sign my add card

This student is also informed that I only allow two unexcused absences per quarter, and that because my class has already met four times, it would be impossible for him to earn a passing grade.  He responds:
i can get excuses

I want to inform him that I'm not sure how he can be absent in a course in which he isn't enrolled, but fear the inevitable literalism of his reply.  ("i wuznt there but have doctors note")  So I tell him that I only allow four total absences because that amounts to twenty percent of the entire course, and a student who misses twenty percent of a course cannot earn a passing grade.  He responds:
i make up the work r u in ur office now

I turn off the computer and re-read the material I'm teaching next week.  He responds:
wheres ur office to sign my card

I compose study questions for my students.  The computer is still off.  He responds:
need to no where ur office is to sign card soon

I eat lunch.  He responds:
fine i dont hear from u soon u reget it

I consider responding to ask what I'll get again, but needn't have bothered.

Scott, you're lucky if you can keep these "late bloomers" from joining your class.  I was always told that I couldn't consider some absent until s/he was enrolled in the class.  If someone adds during the three week drop/add period, s/he must be allowed to make up any graded work.  

Most colleges need stricter drop/add regulations.  Students should only be able to add a course that they've attended from the start without having enrolled.  That is, students should be attending \*more\* than the courses on their schedule, so that should they drop a class, they aren't behind in the class they will add.  

Then again, if we had anything like a real curriculum at most universities, there wouldn't be so much "shopping around" during drop/add.
