## Six Shining Glasses, Consumed Rapidly, Stuffed with Irregular Hungarian  Verbs

This past Monday, [Cultural Revolution](http://cultrev.typepad.com/cr/) wrote about Christopher Hitchen's pounding of _The John Hopkins Gude to Literary Theory and Criticism_.  The title of CR's entry floats above a photo of a blitzed and bloated Hitchens: "[Hard to copy edit when you're loaded...](http://cultrev.typepad.com/cr/2005/05/hard\_to\_copy\_ed.html)"  According to Gore Vidal, it's easier than it looks.  In 1980's "[This Critic and This Gin and These Shoes](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/7309)"--a paean to [Edmund Wilson](http://www.nybooks.com/images/levines/wilson\_edmond-19800925004R.2.gif) on the occasion of the publication of his [notebooks and diaries](http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&sourceid=41397204&bfpid=0374275726)--Vidal notes that the alcoholism that "ended the careers of Hemingway [and] Fitzgerald" and "turned the William Faulkner of _As I Lay Dying_ into a fable" failed to topple Wilson:
Meanwhile, the contemporary of these three blasted stars, Edmund
Wilson, outlived and outworked them all; he also outdrank them. Well
into his seventies, Wilson would march into the Princeton Club and
order a half dozen martinis, to be prepared not sequentially but
simultaneously—six shining glasses in a bright row, down which
Wilson would work, all the while talking and thinking at a rapid pace.
To the end of a long life, he kept on making the only thing he thought
worth making: sense, a quality almost entirely lacking in American
literature where stupidity—if sufficiently sincere and
authentic—is deeply revered, and easily achieved. Although this _was_
a rather unhealthy life in the long run, Wilson had a very long run
indeed. But then he was perfect proof of the proposition that the more
the mind is used and fed the less apt it is to devour itself. When he
died, at seventy-seven, he was busy stuffing his head with irregular
Hungarian verbs. Plainly, he had a brain to match his liver.

Note how Vidal is careful to temper his praise of American literature by reminding his (and its) readers that it is, fundamentally, profoundly nonsense; that "sense [is] a quality almost entirely lacking in American literature where
stupidity—if sufficiently sincere and authentic—is deeply
revered, and easily achieved."  Wilson, Vidal implies, spoke intelligently and rationally about the boundless stupidity that is American literature.  Read generously, Vidal intends something like "Wilson thought and wrote intelligently about something that should've been beneath his notice."  This generosity is rewarded in the review's ultimate paragraph, in which Vidal unveils his real target: English professors who would disagree with Wilson's dictum that 
no matter how thoroughly and searchingly we may have scrutinized works
of literature from the historical and biographical point of
view…we must be able to tell the good from the bad, the
first-rate from the second-rate. We shall not otherwise write literary
criticism at all.

After one final cheap shot (in the form of the most marvelous parenthetical insertion I've ever encountered), the essay concludes gnomically:
We do not, of course, write literary criticism at all now. Academe has
won the battle in which Wilson fought so fiercely on the other side.
Ambitious English teachers (sic!) now invent systems that have nothing
to do with literature or life but everything to do with those games
that must be played in order for them to rise in the academic
bureaucracy. Their works are empty indeed. But then their works are not
meant to be full! They are to be taught, not read. The long dialogue
has broken down. Fortunately, as Flaubert pointed out, the worst thing
about the present is the future. One day there will be no…. But
I have been asked not to give the game away. Meanwhile, I shall drop a
single hint: Only construct!

How does this pertain to CR's post or the conversation over on [the Valve](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/le\_langue\_de\_bois\_christopher\_hitchens/)?  I don't know anymore.  I knew when I started writing, but that was a long, long time ago, like paragraphs, man, and I can barely see to scroll...

Critics of English departments seem to do nothing but berate English departments for only talking about what English departments do.
