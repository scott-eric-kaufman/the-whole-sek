[Silas Weir Mitchell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silas\_Weir\_Mitchell)'s best known for locking [Charlotte Perkins Gilman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte\_Perkins\_Gilman) in an attic for a couple of months.  (If it not for him, millions of undergraduates would've been denied the pleasure of reading "[The Yellow Wallpaper](http://www.library.csi.cuny.edu/dept/history/lavender/wallpaper.html).")  I've read [a _little_ Mitchell](http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the\_little\_professor/2006/03/and\_counting.html) [_thanks Miriam_] lately and wanted to share some of his sound advice for mental laborers with my mentally laboring audience.  

First and foremost, you people are filthy.  _Intellectually_ filthy.  Achtung!  Strip and deposit your filthy self in a frigid tub immediately!
A great lawyer, whom [Mitchell] questioned lately as to
this matter, told [him] that his cure was a chapter or two of a novel, with a cold
bath before going to bed; for, said he, quaintly, “You never take out of a cold
bath the thoughts you take into it.”

Did I not mention the novel?  Achtung!  Relax with a novel!  Still feeling unduly taxed?  Ride a horse!
There is a Turkish proverb which occurs to me here, like most proverbs, more or less true: "Dreaming goes afoot, but who can think on horseback?"

_Still_ feeling overworked?  There's nothing Mitchell and I can do for you.  But here's what to expect:

				When an overworked and worried victim has sufficiently sinned against these simple laws, if he does not luckily suffer from disturbances of heart or stomach, he begins to have certain signs of nervous exhaustion.As a rule, one of two symptoms appears first, though sometimes both come together. 

Work gets to be a little less facile; this astonishes the subject, especially if he has been under high pressure and doing his tasks with that ease which comes of excitement. With this, or a little later, he discovers that he sleeps badly, and that the thoughts of the day infest his dreams, or so possess him as to make slumber difficult. Unrefreshed, he rises and plunges anew into the labor for which he is no longer competent. Let him stop here; he has had his warning. Day after day the work grows more trying, but the varied stimulants to exertion come into play, the mind, aroused, forgets in the cares of the day the weariness of the night season, and so, with lessening power and growing burden, he pursues his purpose. At last come certain new symptoms, such as giddiness, dimness of sight, neuralgia of the face or scalp, with entire nights of insomnia and growing difficulty in the use of the mental powers; so that to attempt a calculation, or any form of intellectual labor, is to insure a sense of distress in the head, or such absolute pain as proves how deeply the organs concerned have suffered. Even to read is sometimes almost impossible; and there still remains the perilous fact that under enough of moral stimulus the man may be able, for a few hours, to plunge into business cares, without such pain as completely to incapacitate him for immediate activity. Night, however, never fails to bring the punishment; and at last the slightest prolonged exertion of mind becomes impossible. In the worst cases the scalp itself grows sore, and a sudden jar hurts the brain, or seems to do so, while the mere act of stepping from a curb-stone produces positive pain.
