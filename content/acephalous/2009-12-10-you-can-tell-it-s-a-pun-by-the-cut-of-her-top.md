I was thinking that this, Valérian : Les Extras de Mézières, was pretty juicy from the person who brought you the Fifth Element.  

[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/2205044435/sr=1-31/qid=1260500940/ref=dp\_image\_0?ie=UTF8&n=283155&s=books&qid=1260500940&sr=1-31](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/2205044435/sr=1-31/qid=1260500940/ref=dp\_image\_0?ie=UTF8&n=283155&s=books&qid=1260500940&sr=1-31)

Maybe it's not that wild, but check out my "Hello Little Girl@ post.  I've been shell shocked from looking at kiddie porn.

Here's a BeDe for you: _Natacha, hôtesse de l'air_ or _Natasha, the Stewardess_.  That should give you a clue on the racy bit.

Would say this was a pretty pathetic attempt at humor on your part,but you did cause over 500 hits and just as many traffic hits,so thank you.As far as more embarrassing reads,I guess 85%!o(MISSING)f Marvel's books though (primarily X-Men).

Sorry, I didn't mean to suggest that everything you've posted belongs in this category.  Material I skipped over includes _Mouse Guard_ and _Cowboy Bebop_, to name a few from the first few pages.  It's just that you're so damn _encyclopedic_ in your collecting, and as someone writing a book on how to teach comics in a college classroom, I find it valuable ... even if I'm surprised someone bothered to scan many of the titles you've collected.

Well,before bashing ANY title out there,you should still look at content of story,instead of simply bashing it for the cover.Truth is,more indie comics have better stories than mainstream,even Hollywood has proven that with movies of Ghost World,The Crow and countless others.And if I was "encyclopedic" as you call it,then we would have nothing but mainstream book.And if you had wanted to give a bad example of the "bad girl"era of comics,this would have worked better:

[http://secretstash1.blogspot.com/2009/11/lady-death-vs-vampirella.html](http://secretstash1.blogspot.com/2009/11/lady-death-vs-vampirella.html)

but that's just an "encyclopedic" opinion.And if you are writing a book of such material,do yourself and the comic community a favor and try to lose that mainstream mentality that seems to be coming through......even Alan Moore,Warren Ellis and Jeff Smith have written books in the vein of what you are calling trash.

Dude, "encyclopedic" ain't an insult.  I could've opted for "preservationist," if that'd been less offensive.  That said, I haven't called anything "trash," nor do I have a "mainstream mentality."  I work on Moore because he's a particularly innovative figure in terms of the conventions of the genre, not because he's worked for DC.  I'm not trying to establish any indie credibility here, because honestly, who cares?  But I don't think you'd see Gilbert Hernandez and Jaime Hernandez catering to raging adolescent hormones like, say, [this](http://secretstash1.blogspot.com/2009/11/lady-death-river-of-fear.html).  

All of which is only to say I'm not judging anything by its cover, only that some of those covers are designed to appeal to a demographic that, to put it bluntly, think women aren't people so much as breasts to have sex with.

I guess we will simply have to agree to disagree,then.The "encyclopedic" term seems to imply "standard",which to me is insulting.You really should re-read your own statement especially the part "find covers that make you more embarrassed to tell anyone out of middle school that you even read".....if that isn't judging a book by it's cover,then what is? Since you cited Buddha,may I ask HOW you felt that appealed to "raging adolescent hormones" ,since it obviously a guy on the cover? And as far as the Hernandez brothers,Love & Rockets was ALWAYS in the adult section of comic book stores,and drew just as much hormone-driven work as well

[http://www.lambiek.net/artists/h/hernandez\_jaime/hernandez\_jaime.jpg](http://www.lambiek.net/artists/h/hernandez\_jaime/hernandez\_jaime.jpg)

Your "breasts to have sex with" mentality is funny since no comic reader I know has ever looked at ANY comic cover that way,you are actually the 1st person I have ever really heard say that outside religeous context.I sight Moore for 2 reasons,1 is he now does most of his work at the most obscene comic company out there,Avatar Comics,and 2,have you ever read Lost Girls? That is comic pornography if I have ever seen it.Being a Moore fan,I hated I couldn't even finish it.

But I grow tired of this myself,just another thank you again,as some of your readers have opted to actually check out more than covers (gotta love feedjit),which proves again ANY press is good press.

And fyi......ain't is not a real word,lol.

_ain't is not a real word,lol._

Is too!  (And I have the degree to prove it make it so.)

_The "encyclopedic" term seems to imply "standard"_

I can flex my Doctor of Philosophy of Literature muscles again and say that, according to some online dictionary that cites no precedent and shouldn't be relied on, "encyclopedic" means "embracing many subjects; comprehensive," which is what I meant.  Not "standard" in the least, so I think we can agree to agree (no matter what's on TV).

_Since you cited Buddha,may I ask HOW you felt that appealed to "raging adolescent hormones"_

You're absolutely right: that cover is like anti-matter to hormones in the same way that Deepak Choprah's likely to implode a universe if he ever comes in contact with an idea that he can't assimilate into his worldview.  (No, that makes no sense ... but it's a nonsensical _homage_, so all is good.)

_Your "breasts to have sex with" mentality is funny since no comic reader I know has ever looked at ANY comic cover that way ..._

... all I can say is that I've read comics since I could read, and there _are_, beyond any shadow of a doubt, some readers of comics for whom such covers are, shall we say, "material" of an uncouth sort.  I _really_ don't want to belabor this point, but there are people who aren't well-adjusted and think that covers like the ones I'm mocking are ... I can't hardly believe I'm saying this.  Seriously, I don't even watch _The Simpsons_, but I know from Comic Book Guy.  C'mon!

_That is comic pornography if I have ever seen it.Being a Moore fan,I hated I couldn't even finish it._

See, here's where things get really interesting.  I don't think _Lost Girls_ is pornography, because I don't think Moore intends it to be pornographic.  He's interested in delving into issues that seem ... but I'm not going to discuss _Lost Girls_ right now, because justifying its existence requires writing a novel, and I can barely hunt-and-peck a short story at the moment.  (But I will, in the future, if you're interested.  Seriously, I'm not trying to drive you away!)

I seem to be reading a lot of things this morning in which someone gets greatly exercised by taking a small piece of a writer's work as the whole and taking offense at the person because of that piece's omissions. 

It's finals season, people: save the outrage for the blue books.

Wow.....just WOW!!!! I have actually read over a few different posts on this little blog,and I have to say.....pseudo-intellectual behavior at it's most typical state.It's not even worth my time typing anymore,simply because I have seen too many diatribes on this blog that if I start with one,I would have to go through it all.

So what I leave you with is this....the hollow feeling that you won and forced me away,because not matter how smart your degree makes you, you have proven to be more one-sided in your train of thought than I could have imagined.

But btw,cursing on Deadwood was a metaphor for how low-down and degenerate the characters that used it were.....something that used to be conveyed by them wearing a black hat....not the big brain teaser you seemed to make it.

_the hollow feeling that you won and forced me away_

You came here because we -- the author and the readers -- were interested in your work. You decided to be offended at a fairly positive comment, and then decided to stay offended even after several people tried to mollify you. It's not combat: you're clearly struggling against yourself. 

_because not matter how smart your degree makes you_

The degree doesn't make you smart, Scarecrow; nobody knows that better than those of us with degrees. But getting the degree does involve learning some useful logical and methodological tools. 

_you have proven to be more one-sided in your train of thought than I could have imagined._

If you think _this_ discussion was one-sided, you really, really need to spend less time on the internet.

Not particularly caring on this discussion,I do have to point out a few things everyone missed.

NOTHING in the original post or any comment have been complimentary.

In familiarizing myself with the person writing this blog,one interesting page turned up on google:  

[http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/07/media-criticism-scott-eric-kaufman-tears-brent-bozell-into-shreds-and-gobbets-and-then-eats-the-gobbets.html](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/07/media-criticism-scott-eric-kaufman-tears-brent-bozell-into-shreds-and-gobbets-and-then-eats-the-gobbets.html)  

I read this twice to make sure I read a few things right,and it seems the "ripping to shreads" is GREATLY overblown in the fact that both arguments say the EXACT SAME THING.I was amused by the opening line of the article.

Being a comic book reader myself,I do have to agree that Alan Moore's Lost Girls is a point that SHOULD have been covered when talking of this subject.The book is nothing but depictions of sexual acts,but is obviously forgiven by the author here simply because Alan Moore is well known.As far as the drawing of characters in a sexual manner,Wonder Woman herself is the 1st bare-skinned character in comics,followed by Supergirl and the spandex wearing girls drawn to be "bombshells" ie: Catwoman,Jean Grey,Mary Watson-Parker,The Black Cat,Black Widow etc. , all characters that are more widespread and more accessible to these teenagers you speak of than a book that is now out of print.

Oh, it's the "you didn't talk about _everything_, so I can ignore you" gambit. 

You're misreading the Bozell thing, but then you go on to do more or less the same thing you say Scott's doing: you say exactly the same thing (viz, that many comic book covers [and female characters in general] are designed to appeal to prurient interests) that he's saying, but you seem to think that there's some deep, philosophical disagreement here.

Obviously,you seem to think I am going for some philosophical side to things.Truthfully,I stumbled across this and pointed out where both parties missed partial arguments.I did leave out the fact that to think a novel had to be written to explain the existence of a 2 issue series called Lost Girls is very pompous (even Alan Moore would agree).

To condemn some of these works based on cover makes me remember the book burnings of decades ago because people decided the names were obscene(Slaughterhouse 5 or Fahrenheit 451),or that subject matter was blasphemous(Tom Sawyer).But I digress.

The only real "pro" comments I have seen on here point out silly things,such as a simple misspelling of a word,none of us are perfect (though a lot of us act like we are),or simple degradation of any opinion that differs from the authors.

So in short,whether you hold a PhD in English or simply read a blog and banter like sheep in agreement,no one commenting here has the real right to say what is or is NOT a form of art.....wasn't Picasso labeled insane in his day?

Pointing out that a character such as Wonder Woman was drawn provocative long before any of his examples was not an agreeing argument,but rather to point out a flawed thought pattern.

I will give credit however to no one arguing to point of the Hernandez Brothers works,since it is categorized as an adult comic,while out of the books in question in this post,only one has the Mature Readers warning.

And while I have not set out to insult anyone,I will have to say,do the research before attempting your book,Doctor.
