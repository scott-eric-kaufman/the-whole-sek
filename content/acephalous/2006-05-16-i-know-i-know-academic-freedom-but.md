Were a panel of my peers to find that I “had committed falsification,
fabrication, plagiarism, failure to comply with established standard
regarding author names on publications, and a ‘serious deviation from
accepted practices in reporting results from research,’” I would _expect_
to find a pink slip in my box.  Academic freedom shouldn’t protect the
falsifier, the fabricator, or the plagiarist from dismissal, should
it?  Or is this one of those cases in which we defend the worst for
fear of future actions against respectable but politically unpopular
scholarship?  

Looking over the biographies of the committee members and the examples of patent plagiarism included in the report—available [here](http://www.colorado.edu/news/reports/churchill/download/WardChurchillReport.pdf)
[.pdf]—it doesn’t appear Ward Churchill’s work has been _unfairly_
impugned by ideologues.  A committee of this sort would want to seem
politically neutral, of course, but the one which indicted Churchill at
least appears to be.  (Those more familiar with the scholars can speak
to this, perhaps.) My reservations stem from the fact that the
committee was launched _after_ his inflammatory comments about 9/11, which makes this process an indirect attack on academic freedom.

Still, had Ward Churchill not been a falsifier, a fabricator, or a
plagiarist, the committee wouldn’t have called (however tentatively)
for his dismissal.  Other, more informed voices care to pipe up?  (Or
is everyone else equally confused?)

Dude,  If a friend mentions the dating site True.com, tell him to take a cold shower and go downtown to find a hooker.  The gangsters as True.com will swindle him out of his identity.

A glance suggests he is guilty. Sadly, I fear that such scrupulous investigation would reveal similar activity going on elsewhere. In the case of the last 60 years of history of Israel/Palestine, the scope of fabrication is stunning, although as far as I can see, pretty heavily weighted in one direction (Norman Finkelstein's "Image and Reality of the Israel Palestine Conflict" carefully takes some of the more influential pro-Israeli inventions to pieces, although I have my doubts about his interpretation of sources in Chapter 1).   

Every once in a while, I have the urge to look up as many footnotes as possible in something I'm reading... it's a rather frustrating and depressing activity - the level of carelessness and outright misrepresentation that prevails is enormous compared to what it ought to be. Worse in more politically charged cases, but often extremely lazy elsewhere. But academics have less time on their hands than ever for research - who has time to check every footnote?

I don't think it's unreasonable to suggest that if you are going to make of  yourself a professional (if not necessarily productive) irritant to those in power, you should have your house in order personally and professionally for when the inevitable counterpunch starts flying toward you.

I will note that Noam Chomsky appears to have a very secure job, still.  There's probably a lesson in that.
