_SEK's
 apartment complex just  installed a basketball court right next to his 
apartment. SEK thinks  this is awesome because he finds shooting 
basketballs to be a zen-like  activity. So at 8 a.m. SEK takes his 
basketball and shoots around for an  hour._

**SEK:** (_shoots_)

**SEK:** (_gathers rebound_)

 _FOURTH GRADER #1 enters the court._

**SEK:** (_shoots_)

**SEK:** (_gathers rebound_)

**FOURTH GRADER #1:** Pass me the ball, would you?

**SEK:** (_passes the ball_)

**FOURTH GRADER #1:** (_airballs_)

**SEK:** (_gathers rebound and shoots_)

**FOURTH GRADER #1:** Hey! It was still my shot!

**SEK:** (_passes the ball_) Sorry about that.

**FOURTH GRADER #1:** (_airballs_)

 _FIFTH GRADER #1 appears on the court._

**FIFTH GRADER #1:** (_gathers rebound and shoots_) SKRRRRRAAAAAAAAAA!

**SEK:** Where did you come—

 _FOURTH GRADER #2 joins him._

**FOURTH GRADER #2:** (_gathers rebound and looks around_) PRRRRRAAAAAAAAAA!

**SEK:** Where did you—

_As does THIRD GRADER #1._

**FOURTH GRADER #2:** (_passes to THIRD GRADER #1_) FRRRRRAAAAAAAAAA!**

**THIRD GRADER #1:** (_fumbles pass_) KRRRRRAAAAAAAAA!  

****

**SEK:** (_gathers ball and shoots_)

_Some INTERDIMENSIONAL PORTAL must have been opened because..._

**FIFTH GRADER #2:** Quit hogging the ball!  

****

**THIRD GRADER #2:** (_shoots)_ BRRRRRAAAAAAAAAA!  

****

**FIFTH GRADER #3:** (_gathers rebound and airballs_) NNNNNAAAAAAAAAA!  

****

**FOURTH GRADER #3:** (_gathers rebound and airballs_) MMMMMEEEEEEEEEE!  

****

**SEVENTH GRADER #1:** (_gathers rebound_) SLLLLLAAAAAMMMMM! (_not even close_)  

****

**SIXTH GRADER #1:** (_gathers rebound and runs away with ball_) TRRRRROOOOOOOOOO!_  
_ ****

**SEK:** Come back here!  

****

**SIXTH GRADER #1:** (_throws ball into fence_) TRRRRROOOOOOOOOO! (_runs away_)  

****

**SEK:** (_gathers ball and makes to leave the court_)  

****

**ALL THE CHILDREN:** HEY! COME BACK WITH OUR BALL!  

****

**SEK:** It's my ball!  

****

**ALL THE CHILDREN:** HE'S STEALING OUR BALL!  

****

**SEK:** IT'S MY BALL! I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU CAME FROM!  

****

**ALL THE CHILDREN:** THAT'S OUR BALL! IT HAS OUR NAME ON IT!  

****

**SEK:** YOUR NAME IS "SPALDING NBA"?  

****

**ALL THE CHILDREN:** IS YOURS?

_SEK 
declines to answer their question  and walks away. He realizes that if 
he stayed out any longer he'd look  like a creepy old man who shouldn't 
be playing basketball with children  anyway. But since SEK lives right 
next to the basketball court, he walks  the long way back to his 
apartment lest ALL THE CHILDREN realize which  porch is his and decide 
to play [Eschaton](http://paytonij.wikispaces.com/Eschaton) with the many plants on it._

The children in my apartment complex were out roaming in feral packs today, too. Completely blocking the roads around the complex with their utterly slow five-abreast walking, all with headphones in, and even when they turned and saw me, making eye contact, they didn't move out of the way until I revved my engine right behind them. Did they receive some kid version of Order 66?

Football with arms and nets. You know the one.

_Did they receive some kid version of Order 66?_

Granted, it's a Sunday, so the only ones out there are the ones skipping church, so they're obviously demonic in some way, shape or form.

The title of this post wasn't always a 'Mats reference, was it? 

Tommy says so.

It was. (And I still need to respond to your comments from earlier on the _BB_ post. Am falling way behind. My apologies.)
