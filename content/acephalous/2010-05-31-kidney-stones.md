No, "ouch" doesn't do it.

Yow!  Hooray for hospitals and diagnoses and effective treatments.  Hope you mend well and quickly from here.

Not feeling better; I mean, I _am_, as a diagnosis/painful treatment means the past few days might not repeat, but "better" is a relative term with which I currently have no relation.

Poor Scott! I hope you get better soon and have a good rest. (Is it terrible of me to immediately think of the kidney-stone sequence in Deadwood?) 

Chin up!

I hate to bring this up BUT...Just because you passed two doesn't mean you will have more.  Diet plays a part in who gets them and your diet recently leaves much to be desired.  You need to take better care of yourself and stop having the drama going on so the rest of your family can have some piece.  No, really, we love you and you keep us on our toes, but really, even your sis is going crazy here. And we will see you soon!

Holy shit!! Best wishes Scott! Of course now Sisyphus's _Deadwood_ comment has ruined me - the words 'massage his prick' are jostling, in my brain, with the words 'insurance claim' - so now I have to stop. Get better, man. Lower Blogistan will attempt to govern itself in your absence. :)

I missed Sisyphus's comment -- I'm just now emerging from the haze -- but yes, I can't believe I didn't make the _Deadwood_ connection myself.  All I'll say is that, the pain notwithstanding, I'm glad they've replaced "fuckin' prick poles" with ultrasounds and what-not.

I feel better about how I reacted to the stones after re-watching that scene: the pain reduced Al to yelling, "Mother of God, help me Christ!"  That's right: it sucked the profanity right out of him.  Unbelievable.

My parents are both Urologists, and they both used to squeeze a wedge of lemon into their waters during dinner. Apparently the citric acid, however mild, prevented kidney stones from developing.

[http://www.uwhealth.org/files/uwhealth/docs/pdf/kidney\_citric\_acid.pdf](http://www.uwhealth.org/files/uwhealth/docs/pdf/kidney\_citric\_acid.pdf)

Also, avoid iced tea. All iced tea.

What's odd is that I do that too: I always squeeze lemon in water.  However, I also drink a lot of iced green tea.  Any idea why iced tea is so bad?  Google's not being very forthcoming.

[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/115870.php](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/115870.php)

In short: Iced tea, along with other foods, is high in oxilates, which form kidney stones. Keep hydrated, low oxilate intake, high citric acid intake, you'll never have another stone.(maybe)

Of course, it really is best to just ask your doctor.

I was thinking more of the scene where the whole "dysfunctional family" surrounds him in the bed and clings to him while he screams and passes the stones. 

Which is to say, it sucks, but we're here for you, dude. :)

_I was thinking more of the scene where the whole "dysfunctional family" surrounds him in the bed and clings to him while he screams and passes the stones._

Aah, 'Requiem for a Gleet.' One of my favourite episodes. (Dority's line 'Al's fucked up, Wu' is hard for me to watch; it's a crying-dad thing for me, I suspect, but also a helpless-son thing!)

But I can't help feeling, every single time I see that 'birth' scene, that Cochran's final line ('Thank you for saving me') is a tad too explicit. It's not as if that dynamic of grateful reenergization isn't present throughout the scene, and Cochran's bravery/loathing/optimism rings through the entire run of the show, particularly his 'what conceivable godly use' speech in Season One. Milch doesn't tend to make mistakes of that kind, which makes it extra weird for me. 'Thank you, Al' is heartbreaking, but the clarificatory followup...?

Stay strong, son!! Be bold.
