In one of my classes yesterday, I was trying to make a point about the use of space in _Last Tango in Paris_ but could not, for the life of me, remember who directed it. Because it maddens me when information's on the tip of my brain, and I can't be able to pay attention to anything until I figure out what I'm just barely not remembering, I walked over the lecturn to quickly Google the film. Unfortunately, I was currently using the lecturn to display images from another film, and this was what popped up:

[](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/last-tango-in-paris.jpg)Ever wondered what's really high on my list of "Things I Never Wanted to Discuss in Class"?

Now you know.

(It's not that I’m averse to discussing rape in class—I do so [when I teach _Blowup_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/the-disturbing-wrongness-of-antonionis-blowup.html)—it’s just that that’s a discussion that needs to be carefully moderated and respectfully handled, _i.e._not the sort of thing you want to be surprised by in class.)
