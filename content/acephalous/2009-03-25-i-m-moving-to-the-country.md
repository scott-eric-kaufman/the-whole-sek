Sounds like a communications major to me.

My usual passive-aggressive approach is to wake up at my normal 6 a.m. and turn on my NPR with the stereo right next to the shared wall.  When \*they\* came over to complain, the discussion actually meant something.

That was really funny. My question is, where the hell do these people crawl out of?

People who live in places where it's currrently warm enough to work outside sure do find things to complain about...

And that obnoxious neighbor grew up to be .... Jeff Goldstein! 

And now you know ... the rest of the story!

Would you like a link as to how to make a Balkan overtone flute (made to be played only on a mountainside ten miles from the next nearest person), for a few dollars, in about ten minutes?

My housemates and I go for the extremely immature response. Our upstairs neighbors blare their music, dance music or bad rap, both early and late (they have been known to start at 8 am on Saturdays). We've tried talking and we get ignored, so now we occasionally have "band practice" which consists of a badly squeeking clarinet, a didjeradoo, two hand drums, and dancing (i.e. jumping up and down). Also, we are considering buying headbands, bright spandix, glowsticks, maybe E, and showing up at their door ready to join the dance party.

Also, I just found this blog (not sure which other blog linked me, I came through The Valve, dunno what took me there) and love it, I've been going through the backlog while being bored at work.

I vote for severely overwatering the plants on the balcony when you hear her voice!

Perhaps because of your fondness for Zork parodies that are set where you work, I tend to picture your surroundings as those in [this MC Frontalot video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nigRT2KmCE).

_When \*they\* came over to complain, the discussion actually meant something._

I'm creating my official response, to be blared once she steps out on the porch again.  Stay tuned.

_My question is, where the hell do these people crawl out of?_

That's what the wife and I want to know.  This girl's _a grad student_ who talks on the phone all day and well into the evening, which is bad enough---but the topic of her conversation has never, not even once, been remotely academic.  

_My housemates and I go for the extremely immature response._

I like the way you think.  (My wife, not so much.  More on that shortly.)  Also, welcome!  Like-minded immaturity is the strongest of social bonds.

"This girl's a grad student who talks on the phone all day and well into the evening, which is bad enough---but the topic of her conversation has never, not even once, been remotely academic."

Perhaps she's the partner of a grad student, and not herself a grad student.

You wouldn't have to be too sexy if you wanted to attract a stereotypical presumably upwardly mobile grad student in the sciences.  Or it could be love on the principle that opposites attract.

On our side, we have a crazy lady who's always yelling mean things at her gaggle of children. She seems to be the wife of a live-in Verano employee.
