... this is, most likely, even better than the real thing:

That is all.

Do you mean that the opening credits are likely better than the show, or that the show may be an improvement on the source comic book?

Only that that's a fan-made opening credits sequence, and I have my doubts that the actual one will and/or can be better.  Because that's basically the Platonic Ideal of opening credits sequences for _The Walking Dead_, don't you think?

Because U2 is made of U2?

Couldn't you have quoted Henry James instead? ;)

Harumph.  On the other hand, I don't really listen to them for their lyrics...

So what's that song? (not the U2 song, the one on the fan-credits) ... and will that be the song on the "real" credits?

Ok, I wanted to know who this Daniel Kanemoto was so I looked over on the vimeo page ... you can't \*really\* call this a fan-created credit ---- he's been working in animation and commercials since '99 and he considers this more of a "spec" credit sequence. He's a fan, sure, but it's stretching it to think that random fans are going to have these kind of chops (or equipment --- he talks about using a motion Oxberry camera). 

However, if your main point is: dude, way cool! Then I concur. It's good.

Sisyphus,

It's by Eels, Fresh Blood, off the album just before his most recent one.

That's almost trivially true of any horror movie scenario on film, is it not?

I just realized that I used to Internetlly know this guy, I think. He posted on Brian K Vaughan's forum back in the day, had really good stuff then too. Love that this has come back to me...
