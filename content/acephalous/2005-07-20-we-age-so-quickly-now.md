That I can only categorize this as "From the Archives" makes my point more forcefully than I ever could, but I still feel compelled to quote this statement from the [Onion's interview](http://www.theonionavclub.com/feature/index.php?issue=4129) with the newly reformed Dinosaur Jr. on the eve of their tour:
Nearly sixteen years after Barlow was given the boot...

What!?!  Bands I listened to have been broken up for almost 15 years!?!  But, but, but, these bands were _awesome_.  My bands weren't like the crap bands all those older-than-dirt folks blather on and on and on about.  My bands were _awesome_, I tell you, _awesome_.  

I suppose this isn't the best time to mention that while under the thrall of insomnia I watched unfold on the television the most accomplished cover of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" ever recorded.  But I will anyway.  That the Foo Fighters were the ones performing is beside the point.  

(I believe I can manage to alienate all members of my audience who aren't my immediate contemporaries in a single post.  If you're three months older or younger than me, you no doubt have no idea what I'm talking about.  But that's only because I'm infinitely cooler than you.  I have the indie cred you bartered for and failed to land.  I possess the banter you so pathetically imitate.  That's right children: I'm the King of All Things Trivial, a latter-day Peter Pumpkinhead, if you will.  Hooray for me!)
