... an excerpt from Twain's 
post
 editorial, "[One of Mankind's Bores](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/mark-twain-one-of-mankind.html)" (1871):
I suppose that if there is one thing in the world more hateful than another
to all of us, it is to have to write a letter.  A private letter especially.
 And business letters, to my thinking, are very little pleasanter.  Nearly
all the enjoyment is taken out of every letter I get by the reflection that
it must be answered.  And I do so dread the affliction of writing those
answers, that often my first and gladdest impulse is to burn my mail before
it is opened.  For ten years I never felt that sort of dread at all because
I was moving about constantly, from city to city, from State to State, and
from country to country, and so I could leave all letters unanswered if
I chose, and the writers of them would naturally suppose that I had changed
my post office and missed receiving my correspondence.  But I am "cornered"
now.  I cannot use that form of deception any more.  I am anchored, and
letters of all kinds come straight to me with deadly precision.   

They are letters of all sorts and descriptions, and they treat of everything.
 I generally read them at breakfast, and right often they kill a day's work
by diverting my thoughts and fancies into some new channel, thus breaking
up and making confusion of the programme of scribbling I had arranged for
my working hours.  After breakfast I clear for action, and for an hour try
hard to write; but there is no getting back into the old train of thought
after such an interruption, and so at last I give it up and put off further
effort till next day.

[...]

It comes natural to me in these latter years to do all manner of composition
laboriously and ploddingly, private letters included.  Consequently, I do
fervently hate letter-writing, and so do all the newspaper and magazine
men I am acquainted with.   

The above remarks are by way of explanation and apology to parties who
have written me about various matters, and whose letters I have neglected
to answer.  I tried in good faith to answer them—tried every now and
then, and always succeeded in clearing off several, but always as surely
left the majority of those received each week to lie over till the next.
 The result was always the same, to wit: the unanswered letters would shortly
begin to have a reproachful look about them, next an upbraiding look, and
by-and-by an aggressive and insolent aspect; and when it came to that, I
always opened the stove door and made an example of them.  The return of
cheerfulness and the flight of every feeling of distress on account of neglected
duty, was immediate and thorough.   

Regular posting and contributing to my own [comment threads](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/on-kc-johnsons-.html) will resume shortly.  Had I more time, I'd comment on the post-like quality of 90 percent of Twain's [_Collected Tales, Sketches, Speeches and Essays_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0940450364/diesekoschmar-20).  Crushed as I am, this will have to do.

Aha, is this an excuse to not respond to my email? Guess no one's _mailing_ me cookies either. Humpf.
