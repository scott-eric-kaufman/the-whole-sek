Since this is now my personal Xanga/livejournal/Myspace page -- and because the recommendations on [the podcast thread](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/07/do-you-know-of-any-podcasts-that-sek-would-like-to-listen-to)
 were so exquisite I'm already listening to them while packing -- I 
thought it wouldn't hurt to ask. I'm planning on doing 10 hours days 
from Corona to El Paso and then El Paso to Houston, so I don't want to 
stop for a long lunch -- nor will the three howling cats in my rented 
SUV -- so places I can call in advance and eat on the way would be 
preferred. I've been looking online for such places, but they're either 
far too fancy, which will kill my cats, or they're perfect but _have been recently burned down._ I shit you not: four of the five places that initially excited me have burned down in the past few months.

So ... recommendations? Including on the drive itself, places to stay
 that are cat-friendly, etc. Basically any recommendation you have that 
doesn't amount to "[DON'T BE DEAF YOU ANNOYING LITTLE COCKSUCKER](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/07/the-saga-of-sek-hertz/comment-page-1#comment-612520)." (Which, when you think about it, is probably [The Donalde's way of saying he's going to miss me](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/) when I'm gone. Not enough to stop sexually harassing his students, but enough to feel a pang _above_ his waistline when he does so, you know, in the part of his brain where shame ought to live.)

Assuming you'll be in the Phoenix metro area for lunch, I'd recommend the Cornish Pasty Company in Tempe. Close to I-10, great food, quick and friendly service, and it's a comfortable place to eat alone (if that's what you'll be doing). Some of the staff are grad students at ASU so you get the added benefit of leaving feeling better about the overall state of your life, whatever it may be. It's a local institution for good reason.
