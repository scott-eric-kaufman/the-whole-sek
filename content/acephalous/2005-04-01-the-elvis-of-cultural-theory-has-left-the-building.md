...with bride in tow, no less.  A couple of questions for his [new bride](http://photos5.flickr.com/7324350\_7d53ee6e44\_o.jpg):

1.  Do you really like him, or do you also [believe](http://www.plexus.org/lacink/lacink11/zizek.html) "marriage appears as an act which belongs to the domain of universal symbolic determinations and should as such be independent of personal idiosyncrasies--as if the very notion of marriage does not involve precisely the 'pathological' fact of liking a particular person for no particular rational reason."
2.  Do you know that his ["ideal couple"](http://www.egs.edu/faculty/zizek/zizek-kant-and-sade-the-ideal-couple.html) consists of Kant and Sade?  Do you know who wears the pants in that household?  Or are Kant and Sade just another "everyday aseptic/impotent modern couple" incapable of transposing the vertical into the horizontal?
3.  How is Zizek at transposing the vertical into the horizontal?  Does he "stage these fantasies openly, without the secondary perlaboration which usually masks inconsistensies" or are his secondary perlaborations vital to his operationalizations?  How long can he operationalize before pure egotistic fear gets the best of him?
4.  How do you feel about ["deadlocks"](http://www.google.com/search?q=zizek+%!d(MISSING)eadlock+of%!&(MISSING)sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official)?  You like 'em too?  Thought so.  I'd love to hear your stance on, say, "the deadlock of desire," "the deadlock of the transcendental imagination," "the deadlock of today's Left," "the deadlock of the superego," "the deadlock of the dialogue between the Western New Left and the Eastern European dissisdents," "the deadlock of masculine subjectivity," "the deadlock of symbolization onto the biological opposition of male and female," "the deadlock of the pseudo-revolutionary critics of religion," "the deadlocks of sexual relationship," "the deadlock of the Tarkovskian hero," "the deadlock of post-politics," "the deadloack of repressive desublimation," "the deadlock of sexuality or art today," "the deadlock of multicultural intolerance," "the deadlock of impossibility,""the deadlock of global capitalism," "the deadlock of cultural resistence to capitalism," "the deadlock of formalization in _le symbolique_," "the deadlock of the contemporary world," "the deadlock of the 90's," "the deadlock of upper-class myths of power lost," "the deadlock of positing," "the deadlock of the dialectic," "the deadlock of the subject's radical uncertainty as to its status (what I am _qua_ object for the Other," "the deadlock of human thought," "the deadlock of an essentialist subjectivity," "the deadlock of circularity," "the deadlock of 1914," "the deadlock of depoliticisation," "the deadlock of sexuation," "the deadlock of language," and most importantly, "the deadlock of his [i.e. your new beau's] previous positions."
5.  Do you realize that's how he looks all gussied up?

What do I think of the "'deadlock of' my academic career"?  Since I don't yet have an academic career,  I'm not that worried about it.  That's like worrying about the cancer even now slowly consuming the bodies of the children I don't have.  They'll survive that chemo when they come it.  

As for how long it takes "you kids" to copy all those deadlocks, well, I'm one of the kids comfortable at about 120 WPM, so I didn't C&P those deadlocks.  I retyped them.  Not that time is really an issue for bloggers; after all, the only reason blogs exist is to waste time in mildly productive, or at the very least mildly amusing, ways.

Still, you have to admit: his wife is really really hot.
