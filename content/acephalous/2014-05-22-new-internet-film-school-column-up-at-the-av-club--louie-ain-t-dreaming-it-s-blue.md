My latest Internet Film School column at the AV Club is [open for business](http://www.avclub.com/article/louies-dreamlike-reality-204910)! Sample:

The camera communicates a psychological state, but the logic C.K. follows here isn’t predicated on the uncertainty of dreams so much as the tedium of depression.

Everything is the same visually, in terms of the shot selection, but the situation is growing worse. _Louie_ is increasingly a show about the mundane yet fraught experience of depression, and this mood is reflected in C.K.’s direction.
