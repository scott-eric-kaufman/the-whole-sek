Still reading through _Theory's Empire_--it's 723 pages long, so I could begin every entry with "still reading through _Theory's Empire_" for the next few weeks and not be called a liar--when I ran across my old [tagline](http://www.taglinesgalore.com/faq.html):
Those who raise objections soon find themselves trapped in debates shaped by us versus them forensics, enunciated in an idiom of brazen philosophical avowals and insinuations about the character of adversaries.  Nonconstructionists feel not so much refuted as ostracized.  The humanities became a closed society, captive to a weak epistemology with a mighty elocution. (348)

Before you ask, let me say that yes, I know, that's an offensively long tagline.  But I liked it.  And it allowed me to pick fights without having to say anything.  Graduate students on the graduate student listserv to which I belong would read it, ignoring both what I'd say and what Mark Bauerlein (author of my former tagline) said and  throw around some "brazen philosophical avowals" and "insinuations about [my] character."  Their epistemology was weak, but fortunately for me, so was their elocution; it had all the hallmarks of mightiness but none of the actual might.  Were I not the upstanding individual I am, I'd quote from those "debates" at length; but, alas, those debates are all stored on a computer which I believe is now a table, or a leg of a table, in Mrs. A. Cephalous' study.  Otherwise I'd throw my moral qualms out the window...

You people have opinions.  If you don't express them post-haste, you're liable to have them expressed for you...and you're not likely to like them, not with the filth you think.  You want examples?  You do realize this is the intellectual equivalent of turnin' this car around or making me take off this belt...

You have the right to an opinion. If you choose not to waive this right, one will be appointed for you. Anything it says or does will be attributed to you in a court of law, or a kangaroo court, or even, god-forbid, in the depths of the blogosphere.\*
