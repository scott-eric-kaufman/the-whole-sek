Scott McLemee [may bite his thumb](http://www.artsjournal.com/quickstudy/2008/06/the\_estragon\_code.html) at Valentin Temkine, the French schoolteacher who claims to have cracked the Godot code, but I think he’s onto something:

Godot, whom Vladimir and Estragon are waiting for, is a
Resistance smuggler, who is supposed to smuggle them out of occupied
France into the Italian zone. The two of them are Jews on the run who
come from Paris’ 11 _arrondissement_. They are probably waiting
to be rescued in the spring of 1943 on the dry, limestone heights of
the Southern Alps, somewhere like the Plateau de Valensole.

My French is terrible, but here, roughly, is what Temkine says:

_Waiting for Godot_ is very nearly a fable of the
occupation. People sleep in ditches and aren’t surprised to be beaten.
A man and his servant, laden with possessions, are in flight from
somewhere to somewhere. Everything was different “a million years ago,
in the nineties.” And two people are to meet a third whom they know
only by a single name, a code-name as it were; they don’t know why
they’re to meet him, but it matters. If the assignation fails they’re
to try again in 24 hours, meanwhile hanging about as inconspicuously as
possible. It takes little insight to recognize details from some tale
about Resistance groups[.]

Like I said, my French is terrible … which is why I quoted Hugh Kenner [recapitulating](http://books.google.com/books?id=CS7lEYCPKEUC&pg=PA290&dq=%!h(MISSING)ugh+kenner%!+(MISSING)%!w(MISSING)aiting+for+godot%!&(MISSING)ei=IP9bSKuQMYisswPetIi\_DQ&client=firefox-a&sig=3Qx\_xnNcZOSMcJWocNP\_2FuBkU8#PPA290,M1) the argument he first made in 1973’s [_A Reader’s Guide to Samuel Beckett_](http://books.google.com/books?id=J4tJAAAACAAJ&dq=kenner+%!a(MISSING)+reader%!s(MISSING)+guide+to+samuel+beckett%!&(MISSING)num=100&ei=VAtcSIXIBYGMtAODhIC\_DQ&client=firefox-a).  Few understand the compulsion to “make it new” better than Kenner—his [best work](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520024273/diesekoschmar-20) embodies the ethos it describes—but enlivening moribund themes, forms or arguments entails more than mere repetition.

Because, as we all know, repetition breeds zombies.  (The
unenlivened dead arise, chase away the interlopers and hold mandatory
office hours, &c.)  Grouse away about [Google eating brains](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/google), it _should_ have a beneficial effect on the duplication of scholarly arguments.  [See](http://www.google.com/search?q=%!w(MISSING)aiting+for+godot%!+(MISSING)occupation)?

[_I planned on writing about someone declaring they can prove Homer was a woman, complete with links to Samuel Butler's [**The Authoress of the Odyssey**](http://www.archive.org/details/authoressofodyss00butlrich) (1897), but it turns out someone has [already staked claim](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393057887/diesekoschmar-20)
on my insufficiently absurd example.  I'm not
sure whether I feel chastened or depressed, but I do know that I don't
know how to finish this post now.  I should just stop.  I can't go on. 
I'll go on.  Or not._]

Like you, I thought everyone who reads Beckett knew of this interpretation.  Perhaps in Scott McL's mind, it's buried under a vast pile of other commentary.

(Did you post this anywhere else, so I can go and make a divergent comment?)

When he did his review of the past two years of his _Intellectual Affairs_ column, it struck me that Scott's pile is undoubtedly more vast than anyone else's I know.  (Didn't think it in your terms, obviously, but I thought it nonetheless.)

I think what got to me what the idea that V&E were from the 11th arrondissement, in particular, and that they were hanging out in the Alps.

I think we can both take credit for the bold, clarifying perception that McL reads a lot.

BTW, that's Valentin, masculine.  And the level of detail in the interpretation is indeed excessive.
