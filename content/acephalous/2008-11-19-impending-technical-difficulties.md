## Impending Technical Difficulties

When I logged onto TypePad tonight, I was greeted by this message: 

[![Programmingnote](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0105360a50b7970c-800wi "Programmingnote")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0105360a50b7970c-pi)

When I clicked on it, I was informed I'd already joined the Beta Team by virtue of them having selected me to join it.  This means I now have a comment feed and, I'm told, my readers are already subscribed to it.  That shouldn't have been done to you on my behalf.  I only ask you accept my sincerest apologies for whatever garbage you receive on account of my fiddling with the settings to make the comment feed an "opt in" feature.

So far, comments haven't shown up in the bloglines feed. For what it's worth.

Yeah, comments don't seem to be showing up in the main feed, at least so far. But I'm pumped that such a feed is now an option.

I'm so sorry if we somehow grouped you into something that you didn't want to be in - that's suboptimal to say the least. Do let me know if you need any help fiddling with settings and so forth. :)
