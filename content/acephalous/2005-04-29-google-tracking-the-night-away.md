Someone hit me after googling "deadwood homoeroticism DVDA."  I shit you not.  I'm a little confused about someone simultaneously googling "homoeroticism" and "DVDA," but I suppose it makes the sort of sense I don't think about that often.  Because [I don't want to sound like queer or nothing,] (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0006HBZEW/qid=1114753312/sr=8-1/ref=pd\_csp\_1/103-8289502-8607027?v=glance&s=dvd&n=507846) but I think

1.  Unicorns are kick ass.
2.  You have a hot ass.
3.  I'd kind of like to make love to you tonight.
4.  There's something totally gay about DVDA.

I'm also the official homepage of the phrase "_nostalgie de la boue_."  Not a day passes I don't find forty hits for that gem.

I'm glad to hear my running has paid off.
