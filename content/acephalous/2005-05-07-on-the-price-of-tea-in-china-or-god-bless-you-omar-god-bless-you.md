Difficult as it may be for some of you to believe, but seeing [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/pedro%!c(MISSING)hicken%!a(MISSING)pcadl03\_METS\_SPRING\_005HD.jpg) man do [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/pedropitchapcadl03\_MARLINS\_METS\_0054Q.jpg) every five days makes me feel like [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/pedrohappyapcadl03\_NATIONALS\_ME\_007J4.jpg), liable to do [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/pedrospringyapcadl03\_METS\_SPRING\_0058M.jpg) and tempted to believe [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/pedroprayerapcadl03\_METS\_BRAVES\_00672.jpg) is more than an empty gesture.

As a Red Sox fan I can only remind you that when Pedro is being his full Pedro, the world can be a beautiful place. When the other Pedro (the whinging, complaining, Yankees-are-my-daddy) shows up, life sucks. 

And to replace Petey with David Wells is, well, I can only say that my gut aches every time I pause to reflect. Easier to stop thinking about it and simply shake my head in wonder that the O's are on top of the AL East. (At least its not the Yanks. Damn how I hates them Yankees.)

I don't think the Yankees will be anybody's daddy this year, and that makes me happier than I ever thought I would be.  You might find this hard to believe, but for the past three seasons not only have I rooted for the Red Sox, I've become a full-fledged fan.  I followed the trials and tribulations of Young Theo.  Alone in my living room watching the ALCS, I jumped up and down repeatedly in an embarrassing display of exuberance after Game 7.  So great had my hatred of the Yankees grown that I had forgotten 1986 and actually spoke the words "I can't remember a better series than the 2005 ALCS."  Now if you'll excuse me, I have a rank, weather-beaten Mets cap in need of attention...

I _knew_ there was a reason I liked you besides your intelligent, acerbic commentary!  Embrace me, my brother in Metsdom! (I mean, "embrace" in a manly, sports-guy sort of way, of course.)  Having been a Mets fan (mostly a long-suffering Mets fan) for a quarter of a century now and having recently moved to the People's Republic of Massachusetts, I've started following the Red Sox as well, and few things have made me happier in recent years than seeing them kick the collective ass of the hated Yankees and then go on to Win It All.  I would have been happier to see the Mets win, of course, but I've long given up expecting that to happen.  (I can tell you the exact moment I knew it was all over: the fourth game of the 1988 playoffs, when I was sitting in the right-field stands at Shea and pleading loudly with Davey to take Gooden out and he left him in and the game got out of hand and the Dodgers went on to beat an infinitely superior Mets team and then an infinitely superior Athletics team.  Bitter?  No, I'm not bitter.  Just old and cranky.)

Anyway, let's hope Pedro can keep doing it (didn't he look great last night?) and the Metsies can overcome their lackadaisical start.  Ya gotta believe...
