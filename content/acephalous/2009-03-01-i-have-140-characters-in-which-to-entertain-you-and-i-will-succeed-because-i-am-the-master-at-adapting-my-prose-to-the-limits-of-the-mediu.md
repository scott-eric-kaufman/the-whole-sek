You've changed, man. You used to be cool, but now you've sided with all these hip social networking stuff...

I've never been cool, Jake.  That's what's so lovely about having no cred: you have none to lose.

One of the things I find unattractive about Twitter is the use of tinyurl links. I understand the need, if you're going to have links in that medium, but I dislike the opacity. 

Are you going to embed this feed anywhere on this blog, or are you assuming (hoping? fearing?) that we'll add a fourth venue to our SEK reading?

I might add a feed, but the reason I finally caved is so I have something to do with the written equivalent of earworms---you know, those links that get under your skin and you mull over addressing in a post for a few hours/days.  Ultimately they end up half-drafts in the to-be-deleted folder, but I end up wasting time thinking about them.  This way I can dispense with them quickly and put my mind to more important matters.  (Such is my theory, at least.)

And yes, the tinyurl thing is really annoying.  What's wrong with embedded links?  Are they _really_ trying to keep down overall character costs?

"something to do with the written equivalent of earworms"

Adam Roberts' blog Europrogocontestvision is for things like that.  Going to Twitter is, well, perhaps an overreaction.

Twitter would be a good venue for building up an elaborate, overblown fantasy life, though.  I could imagine myself doing one in which the entries were things like "Why do attractive people keep asking me for casual sex?" and "My poem hailed as new American triumph" or "Sent Email to politician; he promptly resigned, disgusted with himself" and then again "Ate breakfast; eggs today."  Of course that last one might be more delusionally narcissistic in its assumption that followers were interested in it than all the rest.

Oh, I so wish I'd thought of that first. Best argument in favor, ever. The Japanese have already started producing twitter-like narratives (I hestitate to call them "novels" in an environment with literary types who know better) which have seen publication and some real popularity. I don't know that I could sustain that long enough for it to be fun, but I could see some real satirical possibilities (if those haven't been foreclosed by the reality of GOP-Twitters).

The Japanese are as ever ahead of everyone in this regard.  What would really make the narrative, though, would be its real-time element -- instead of just writing it in advance, every minor encounter in real life would be replaced by its fantasy element.  The hot counter-person at the record store?  Just as interested in you!  Plus they really admire that obscure record that you found.  Your class was not attended by bored undergrads but instead enthralled young people who you inspired towards careers in the arts, plus a talent scout for a major university who informed you that they'd heard about your lectures and that you should expect that tenure-track job offer as soon as he could get it in the mail, though he'd type it up right then if he has to keep another university from snapping you up.

All right, that would soon get boring.  But who knows why people read Twitter anyways?  Maybe they wouldn't be bored.  Hell, work that into your fantasy life -- Twitter that "I see that I have thousands of followers, and no, I can't say what's going on in any greater detail."  God-damn fans.

Wait, what am I talking about -- this would be SEK's Twitter.  So of course it would have to go in the other direction.  "Went out for milk -- corner store hold-up in progress.  Job applications ruined by blood stains."  "Nearly electrocuted by computerized podium in class."  "Got interview at MLA.  Panel had printouts of my blog entries; slowly burned them in front of me while laughing derisively in unison."  "This Twitter feed is real, damn it, I have documentation for everything."

It does look familiar, does it not?  I went from hating what I'd done here to now sort of being in love with it---my Gmail and desktop have it too.  I blame [4DOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4DOS).

I can never remember to do this but xrl.us gives you links that let people see the target, and you also save a precious character.  

Also, at some point, many people were getting tweets delivered to their mobiles, so the 140 characters thing was a big deal.

Glad you figured it out, as I don't remember how I did it anymore.  (And expect the Borges post soon.  I'm having to re-read the non-fiction, which I haven't picked up in years, so it's a little more slow-going than I anticipated.)  (_I.e._ unlike _Watchmen_, which I'm currently teaching, it's taking me a little while to say anything intelligent about it.)

I added you to my Twitter friends list so that I might enjoy the brevity of your brilliance.  And yet, you do not add me.  Now you see why Twitter is as evil as Facebook.  

Wolfson has a solution:  [http://waste.typepad.com/waste/2009/02/a-solution-to-all-your-social-networking-anxieties.html](http://waste.typepad.com/waste/2009/02/a-solution-to-all-your-social-networking-anxieties.html)

In case you want to politely re-friend but do not actually want chatter in your life. But you should want my chatter! I tweet about random articles and how much I hate footnotes! Why would you want to miss that?!

You know who I wish was on Twitter? My real life friends. Bloggers I actually correspond with. Etc. So I'm glad you're on. Now where's AWB?!  Probably actually doing something productive.
