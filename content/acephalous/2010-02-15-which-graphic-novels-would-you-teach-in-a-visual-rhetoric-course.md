## Which graphic novels would you teach in a visual rhetoric course?

 * Monday, February 15, 2010



			The plan for the visual rhetoric book I'm co-authoring is to have three or four substantial chapters focusing on 1) rhetoric generally, 2) the history of the medium, 3) the mechanics of comics, and 4) the rhetoric of comics, followed by ten chapters devoted to particular novels that instructors compel their students to purchase.  The problem, as you can probably guess, is deciding which ten books should we subject to sustained close-reading.  We're going to be leaning hard on McCloud's [_Understanding Comics_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006097625X/diesekoschmar-20) throughout, but as for the ten other books, the list we've compiled so far includes:

*   Alison Bechdel, [_Fun Home_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0618871713/diesekoschmar-20)
*   Kohta Hirano, [_Hellsing, Vol. 1_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159307056X/diesekoschmar-20)
*   David Mazzucchelli, [_Asterios Polyp_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307377326/diesekoschmar-20)
*   Frank Miller, [_300_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1569714029/diesekoschmar-20)
*   Hayao Miyazaki, [_Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Vol. 1_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591164087/diesekoschmar-20)
*   Alan Moore, [_Watchmen_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0930289234/diesekoschmar-20)
*   Marjane Satrapi, [_Persepolis_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0618871713/diesekoschmar-20)
*   Gene Luen Yang, [_American Born Chinese_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312384483/diesekoschmar-20)

The idea is to provide a wide variety of central texts to teach—as well as a template for doing so—which is why we have American comics, European comics, and manga; autobiographical works and books decked in tights; novels with readily available film adaptations (_300_, _Watchmen_, _Persepolis_) or companions (Miyazaki's _Nausicaä_ and his animated features like _Howl's Moving Castle_ or _Spirited Away_); etc.  In short, our concern is not to represent the best-and-brightest the medium has to offer, but to offer a selection of novels that will be useful to the greatest number of potential teachers. 

For example, this list lacks an overtly political book like Joe Sacco's [_Palestine_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/156097432X/diesekoschmar-20); Gaiman is absent, as the narrative complexity of the _Sandman_ trades would force him to be represented by a minor work like [_Black Orchid_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0930289552/diesekoschmar-20); Batman is nowhere to found, as we already have a Miller and a Moore, so [_The Killing Joke_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401216676/diesekoschmar-20) and [_The Dark Knight Returns_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563893428/diesekoschmar-20) are out, which means the Nolan films have no natural pair; etc.   

In an ideal world, what other works would you like to see us cover?

\_Jimmy Corrigan\_ seems like the big omission at first glance. I'll try to think of a good Batman story; what about doing \_Year One\_ instead of \_300\_?

The problem with _Year One_ is that it's also Miller ... although, given that it's Miller _and_ Mazzucchelli, maybe there's something that can be done.

As _Corrigan_, not only isn't it there, but Ware somehow didn't even enter the conversation.  I'm not sure why, though.  It's not like debating the relative merits of _Fun Home_ and _Blankets_, in which we decided to go with the former; it's more like we just blanked.  We did not, however, blank on _Black Hole_, which I just can't read because its shapes give me nightmares.  (I went digging for that old belle waring post in which she identified the name of the shape that bugs the both of us, but I can't find it now.)

Do they all have to be _really_ good? I'm thinking of some of the landmark narrative moments, like _Death of Superman_. 

I don't believe that Gaiman's work is _so_ complex that a stand-alone chunk couldn't be profitably analyzed: The episode in the Inn before the Wake, for example, or the first collected volume which describes Morpheus' liberation and recovery.  (leaving the remainder as an exercise for the class, of course!) But what about Gaiman and McKean's [_The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch_](http://www.neilgaiman.com/works/Comics/Mr.+Punch+:+The+Tragical+Comedy+or+Comical+Tragedy/)? It's got a lot of the same visual elements, and Gaiman himself has, apparently, called it one of his best works.

I'd agree with GC, too: Maus probably belongs on the list, or an explanation.

The _Maus_ comment must've been posted as I composed mine.  Why not _Maus_?  We have to exclude something, and excluding the work most likely to be taught in other courses is a decent criterion for omission, no?  Given that this book isn't intended to be a historical survey, mentioning _Maus_ in the chapter on the genre's history should suffice, I think.  Those are professional reasons: the non-professional one is that I have extremely conflicted feelings about _Maus_, much of it having to do with the Holocaust-related story I [told in my joke of a podcast](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/the-first-ever-.html).  That deserves its own post, though, so hold out for _Maus_.  

As for _Mr. Punch_, it's available, but not in print, meaning that the first class to use it would likely exhaust Amazon's reserves.

I don't have much to add.  Generally, I'm not really in favor of teaching _good_ things, where's the challenge?  But even so, _300_?  The epic revision of the story of losing losers who lose into the story of the super-white super-men who saved civilization from dark-
ness
-people through ultraviolence...  Just sub in some Batman--remember, you teach Batman.    

Also, if you're going to teach _Nausicaä_ just show the Nausicaä film; you can't really appreciate any Miyazaki heroine without Nausicaä anyway.

_As for Mr. Punch, it's available, but not in print, meaning that the first class to use it would likely exhaust Amazon's reserves._

But if there were demand -- if it actually were likely to achieve some kind of classic status and regular use as a teaching text -- I imagine that it could come back into print. 

I know, it's a problem. Still, it seems odd to omit one of the major movers of critical opinion, especially since it's so visually different from what you've got on the list already. 

_300_ does seem like a weak choice, though. Sure, it's a bit different. But it reminded me more of the [rotoscoped and incomplete Lord of the Rings](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077869/) than anything else. I'd still take a chunk of Gaiman/McKean over that. 

Since you're already using McCloud, you can't use _Zot!_, which is too bad.

My larger question, would be why Batman? I like the Nolan films as much as anyone, but I don't see why they have to be central or have to be included. However, if Batman is a must, you might want to consider either a Death in the Family or Grant Morrison's Black Glove. I mention Death in the Family not because it's necessarily a great story - although it does have a nice visual reference to La Pieta - but because it asked readers to vote on the Boy Wonder's fate. I picked Black Glove, recently collected I believe, because in some ways it is a straight forward Batman story, but W. H. Williams manages to incorporate a number of interesting intertextual storytelling devices. I might also like to see American Splendor on the list, but hey, it's your book. Who is your co-author?

My appreciation for it is likely rooted in my one-time adolescent angst and the scattered Joy Division references, but I still go back to read J. O'Barr's _The Crow_ from time to time.

_But even so, 300?_

First, as a Mets fan, your name [always warms my heart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbnVqDCuq1M#t=0m57s).  That said, _300_ is in because my co-author has killer, classroom-tested material on the book.  It's not the best of Miller, but in terms of visuals, it's solid (if solidly neo-con).

Ahistoricality:

_I imagine that it could come back into print._ 

I'm saving the pipe dreams for the next book.  

_Since you're already using McCloud, you can't use Zot!, which is too bad._

Given how we're using McCloud, in the discussion of the history of the genre, _Zot!_ will certainly be making an appearance ... as will _Destroy!!!_ (which fact I'm sure you'll appreciate).

Adam:

_why Batman?_

The short answer is that [I've got a collection of really solid material on the films](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/the-dark-knight/), and I want to play to my strengths if we try to spin this off into a second book devoted to films.  

_you might want to consider either a Death in the Family or Grant Morrison's Black Glove._

The only thing I can say about the Morrison is that while I "get" him, I [don't really "get" him](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/05/annals-of-fauxprundity-grant-morrison-is-writing-a-story-for-you-to-read.html), and don't want to do the work (or my reputation) an injustice.

_I might also like to see American Splendor on the list_

I would too, but the thing about having to make cuts is that it's not just the material you don't like that ends up on the floor.

I'd be tempted to include _God's Man_ or something else by Lynd Ward--to provide some historical precedent for comics, and to complicate the whole definition of graphic narrative as "words-and-pictures." Otherwise, I'd second _Maus_ and _Jimmy Corrigan,_ and wholeheartedly agree with _Asterios Polyp_, which may be the most effective use of the form I've ever seen.

Are you really going to author a chapter on "the history of the medium" and include nothing by Jack Kirby?  That seems... odd.

"We have to exclude something, and excluding the work most likely to be taught in other courses is a decent criterion for omission, no?"

No, indeed.  A book on (say) modernist poetry could justify not including _The Waste Land_ in any number of ways, but not including it _because_ it's the most famous modernist poem would be deeply weird.

I think _Jimmy Corrigan_ almost has to be on there; it's probably the most influential comic of the decade (it's hard to imagine _Asterios Polyp_ without it).  And I agree with Caio that Clowes should really be on there—_Ghost World_ probably.

Other good choices: the _Scott Pilgrim_ books (lightweight, but good uses of the medium), and books by Jason (particularly his nonverbal comics).
