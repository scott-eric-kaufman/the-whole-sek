## Notes for Future Satirists

1.  Satire should be funny.
2.  Rechristening something a part of the female anatomy isn't funny unless you're Dane Cook.  ("The Vulva"?  What is so quintessentially feminine about it that nothing but external female genitalia will suffice?  Is it all the words?  Are you frightened by their feminine wiles?)
3.  Satire should not require the satirist to tell the reader what is and isn't funny.  ("This part of the gag wasn't funny"?  _Do tell_.)
4.  The object of satire should be discernible _without having to use a person's real name_.  ("How can we be sure people will know who satirizing?"  "Don't know dude, maybe we should use his real name?"  "Excellent idea!  Then everyone will know who we're talking about.")
5.  Satire should be legible.  (Font sizes below 2 are strongly discouraged.)
6.  The satirist should have a passing familiarity with the object of satire.  ("Cuteness Cat Friday is four days off"?  Do you _want_ to be the Dane Cook of the English department?  Because I have some material on airports, cheese, and those crazy things women do to annoy men that's been killing in the Poconos since 1934.)
7.  Satire should be funny.

Sort of agree with 2-5 - they could have done better than "the Vulva" and I can understand why you'd be upset about 4, but seriously, 1 & 7?  The Mom2233 comment had me in stitches.  And I thought maybe you had written the last comment yourself...since you're usually the first to try to found humor in your tremendously bad luck.  It certainly didn't seem like a dig.

Parts of it _were_ funny, but that's statistically inevitable given the 9,000 words they crammed on that page.  Most of it read like lame blog clichés.  I was waiting for the pajamas, but _alas!_ they never came.  (Wait, did I write "alas"?  Because I meant "_surprise_!")   I mean, I could go through line-by-line and identify the funny bits -- credit being due where it's due -- but the funny bits are satirical outliers, less about blogs or academia than clever turns of phrase. 

(And anyway, were a meteor to crash into my apartment, there's no way I'd ended up "partially blinded."  Surely I'd be stricken with infuriating LASIK-halos, such that I would almost always just about to be able to resolve those smudges into words then fail.)

Thank you for the writing tips, Mr. Kaufman.  As for point #2, I suggest you take that up with whomever made the decision to subtitle the referenced blog 'a literary organ'.

I'm afraid I'm a bit confused about the context of this.  What failed satire are you referring to?

At first I thought it was that _Office_ riff "The Apartment" about all those academics and their oh-so-funny lives. 

I think it is that satire of all the academic blogs. 

"The Vulva" = The Valve. I remember, but not strongly, some sort of thing like that being concocted. Satire should indeed be funny, but I wouldn't gauge it with Dane Cook's brand of humor. That man is one step above Michael Winslow (_Police Academy_ fame). I prefer comedians not normally discussed around high school lunch tables.

I should've been more clear on this one: the English department at UCI has a satirical publication by the same folks who did the [MLAde](http://mlade.org/) thing last month.  On the whole it's funny, but the latest edition shoved in my departmental mailbox consisted of an unfunny satire of Kugelmass's posts on _The Valve_.  Not entirely unfunny, mind you, but mean-spirited.  I tried to include enough information for the post to be understandable to a general audience, but see now I failed.

[http://kugelmass.wordpress.com/2008/01/05/parodying-academic-blogging/](http://kugelmass.wordpress.com/2008/01/05/parodying-academic-blogging/)

The main parody of Kugelmass's Valve posts is BY Kugelmass...hence not mean spirited...(ok, I know the Ant Farm's annonymous, be he outed himself with the post, so I assume this is fair to mention)

Otherwise, I'd totally understand your reaction...but in trying to defend Joe you're actually insulting him.  Anyway, it's much funnier as self-parody...all in good fun...

And you know, I'm such an idiot that I forgot 1) having read that and 2) having commented on it.  I think that has more to do with where I was at the beginning of January than anything else.  (At least I hope it does, what with the alternative being grave memory lapses of the sort I don't expect all the drinking to cause for another four or five months, tops.)

No reason to be confused, two minutes later or what-not.  Take my stupidity at face-value, my friend.  We'll all be better served in the end.

I should point out that "The Vulva" wasn't a coinage, and, as a coinage on par with various outbursts from Dejan et al., is lame.

Now I feel bad for going on record as not finding "the Vulva" funny.  Whatever, it was a funny article and a funny edition of the Ant Farm.  No need to quibble over individual jokes.
