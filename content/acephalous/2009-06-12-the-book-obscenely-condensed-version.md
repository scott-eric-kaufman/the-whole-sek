Because who am I to ignore [interested lurkers](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/06/researching-the-competition-or-why-other-books-about-visual-rhetoric-composition-demonstrate-the-nec.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d6543970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d6543970c)?  What follows is the section on comics and rhetoric I wrote for _The Student Guide to Writing at UCI_.  The book I'm co-authoring this summer is a vastly expanded version of the same (only with panels from actual comics instead of examples drawn from my none-too-fertile imagination).

The basic unit of analysis when dealing with a comic is **the panel**.  The visual elements of a panel can be described using the same vocabulary used to describe a frame from a film: **background** and **foreground**, **diegesis**, **high or low key lighting**,
etc.  Pointing to the similarities between film and comics highlights
what makes comics unique as a medium: the interaction of these visual
components with the written word.  The word-picture relation can **word specific**, in which the words convey the meaning and the images merely illustrate it, as in a children's book; **duo specific**, in which the words and images both convey the same meaning, as when a picture of an irate man yelling is accompanied by a **caption box** that tells you the irate man is yelling; and **interdependent**,
in which the words and images combine to convey a meaning neither is
capable of conveying alone.  Most of the comics you will read in this
course will rely heavily on interdependent word-picture combinations.  

Comics are also unique in the manner in which they relate to time. 
No matter how the words in the panel interact with the visuals, there
is a tension between the static image and the words in the caption
box.  Picture a panel that depicts a medium close-up of a young man in
a bright orange shirt.  A caption box extrudes from his open mouth and
occupies the space above his left shoulder.  The text inside it reads:
"The bride?  You wanna know about . . . the thing it is that happened to
her?  Because sure, I can tell you, but . . ."  All these words didn't
spill from his mouth in the open-mouthed moment depicted in the panel. 
The words propel the narrative forward in time in such a way that we
cannot be sure which word the panel depicts the man enunciating. (It
may not even be a word: the panel could be depicting the pause
indicated by the ellipses.)  This tension between static image and
narrative progress exists not only in panels but between them.  

The empty area between panels is **the gutter**, and it is where
the reader is called upon to become an active participant in the
creation of the text.  Unlike a film, in which the twenty-three
imperceptible gaps between the twenty-four frames flashed per second
create the illusion of movement, the gutter produces breaks in the
narrative that require interpretation to repair.  If the panel
following the one of the man in the bright orange shirt is a
medium-long shot of a different, shabbily-dressed man in a prison
garden holding an open stenographer's notebook and saying, "Yes, I want
to hear about the bride."  What inferences must the reader draw for
those two panels to make sense?  To begin with, the bright orange shirt
in the first panel likely belongs to a prison-issue jumpsuit and the
man across from him (as the reader infers from the comic equivalent of
a shot/reverse shot) is a journalist interested in what this prisoner
did to the woman they both refer to as "the bride."  The act of making
that inference -- of bridging the gap between the first and second
panel -- is called **closure**.  In this case, the closure is achieved via a **subject-to-subject** transition.    

However, were the second panel to depict not a journalist, but a
long shot of the man in the orange shirt unfolding a lawn chair next to
a grill, the "prisoner" would be transformed into a man at a barbeque
discussing an unfortunate incident at a wedding.  If the third panel
showed that same man placing a steak on the grill while continuing to
discuss the wedding, closure between the second and third panels will
have been achieved via an **action-to-action** transition, _i.e._ one
in which consecutive panels depict the same subject undertaking a
series of actions.  If the next three panels track the path of the
steak from the man's tongs to the grill's surface, the reader will be
compelled by this **moment-to-moment** transition to create closure
by associating the steak's slow-motion descent with whatever it was
that happened at that wedding, such that it would not be surprising if
in the fourth panel the steak was replaced by a bouquet of flowers of
the sort brides toss at weddings.  Because the reader knows that steaks
don't often turn into flowers, it is safe to infer that the narrative
has shifted to another place and time via a **scene-to-scene** transition. 
But the assumption that this airborn bouquet is on its way into the
arms of a single woman attending the wedding is not necessarily a safe
one -- an author could be exploiting this conventional image to
confounds the reader's expectations.  In a subsequent panel, the
"empty" space behind the falling flowers could be revealed to be the
white satin of the wedding dress worn by a woman whose pained
expression informs the reader why she dropped the bouquet.  

If that panel were followed by another in which a younger,
tuxedo-clad version of the orange-shirted man from the barbecue perches
on the edge of a bed with his head in hands, then another panel
depicting leaves falling outside a bustling travel agency, then another
still of two empty chairs beneath an oversized umbrella on some
Hawaiian beach, the reader is presented with a number of interpretive
decisions.  The transition from the jilted bride to her cold-footed
fiance could be interpreted as a scene-to-scene transition, as could
the transition from the fiance to the travel agency.  However, because
these panels depict the same moment in a series of different locations,
closure can be argued to have been achieved via an **aspect-to-aspect** transition.  

The interpretive burden required to understand the intent of the
author/rhetor of a comic is, as the previous paragraphs indicate, quite
heavy -- even though the experience of reading comics is so intuitive
that many otherwise intelligent readers consider the medium juvenile. 
That so many comics chronicle the adventures of impossibly-muscled
specimens of post-humanity in tights that reveal more than they conceal
helps sustain this misperception.  But as the story of the prisoner
and/or the man who left his wife at the alter demonstrates, the content
of a comic is not determined by the medium itself.

"cold-footed" -- I like that.

Interesting to see how much of this introduction and the jargon is "cribbed" from _Understanding Comics_. I didn't realise it was that influential still in comics theory.

Scott can speak for himself, but one thing he's consistently said in these discussions is that "comics theory" is in such a sad state that a book as old and basic as McCloud's first (I just got my copy of _Zot_, by the way, but I'm saving it for next week's travel reading) is still more or less state-of-the-art.

Yeah, I don't really see what has come after _Understanding Comics_.

I got a bit lost in the descriptions of different kinds of transitions.  Maybe something right in the middle that says "But there are other kind of transitions.  For instance..."

I hope that the final book avoids the boilerplate Superhero-dissing.  All right, most hipster comic book readers dislike superheroes, except for the painfully ironic metatextual ones.  And anyone writing about comics feels the need to make it clear that they are not wasting time on some despised, adolescent genre.  But can we take those things as read, and have a book with the confidence to not say them?

At this point, it seems like McCloud's only competition is . . . McCloud's _Making Comics_, in which he clarifies a few of the ambiguous points in _Understanding Comics_.  

Rich, it does get a little textually dense in the middle there with all the describing of panels, but that's a problem that's instructive: it's difficult to do with words alone what's done with words and pictures.  We can't afford to publish panels in the _SGTW_, so we're going to have a supplemental website that hosts, among other things, the panels above.  (At least, that's my understanding of it.)

As for the hero-dissing, since we're going to be using _Watchmen_, we're going to have both heroes and the dissing of them, but it's going to be more informed.  Since this is included in a book with 50,000 other descriptions of media and how to read them rhetorically, I had to be brief in my "It's not just tights, people!" diversion.
