roy edroso is clearly an intelligent man, but in [this case](http://alicublog.blogspot.com/2009/05/2009\_05\_03\_archive.html#7199490276777447155) he couldn't be more wrong.  He quotes one of the [geniuses from _Big Hollywood_](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/stkarnick/2009/05/09/zombie-culture-and-the-march-of-socialism/#more-130078) (who, incidentally, just learned what the word "satrap" meant):

In their
neverending quest to wrest more power by creating what H. L. Mencken
correctly characterized as an endless series of hobgoblins requiring a
socialist elite’s powers to destroy, the socialists and their media
satraps continually raise fears of everything conceivable . . .   

Then argues that:

Naturally he doesn't link; this is from Mencken's _In Defense of Women_, and the [passage](http://books.google.com/books?id=mNQt2WQl-VgC&pg=PA51&dq=%!m(MISSING)encken%!+(MISSING)%!e(MISSING)ndless+series+of+hobgoblins%!)(MISSING)
from which it comes doesn't mention socialists at all, and is
explicitly about the starting and conduct of modern wars, which Mencken
attributes to modern civilization "especially under democracy." But I
don't think Karnick was purposely misleading his readers . . .   

Because Mr. Word-of-the-Day wasn't misleading his readers.  roy doesn't seem to realize that conservatives only discovered Seth Graeme-Smith's _Pride and Prejudice and Zombies_ [earlier this week](http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MGI1OTc5ZTA2NTBmMTMyMGFhMmRkYzdkN2U2MzZhZjk=) and that this _Big Hollywood-_style satrap is merely playing along.  Just like Graeme-Smith improved upon Austen by inserting zombies into scenes in which they clearly don't belong, conservatives are now inserting socialists and communists into diatribes in which they clearly don't belong.  

For example, Donald Douglas complains that people find the idea of him being a professor beyond belief, but then [he writes this](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2009/04/youre-professor-really.html):

I saved a classic example of the "I can't believe you're a professor" slur from a post last year," [Matt Yglesias, Jennifer Palmieri, and the Third Way](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/matt-yglesias-jennifer-palmieri-and.html)." As some readers know, Matthew Yglesias is [an American communist](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/03/why\_not\_arbitrary\_limits\_on\_executive\_pay.php). There is no position that's too far to the left for that man.  

Clearly, anyone who thinks that there "is no position too far to the left for [Yglesias]" deserves to have his credentials questioned.  Off the top of my head, I can list _fifteen comments on every one of Yglesias's posts going back seven years_ as evidence that lefter positions than those he's staked exist.  Douglas duct-taped the evidentiary bar to his ankles, so he shouldn't be surprised that people are incredulous when he claims that his day job involves teaching impressionable youths how to hurdle.  

But it's all a ruse.  

Douglas is merely playing the zombifying game with socialists and communists.

He doesn't believe Yglesias is a communist anymore than Graeme-Smith thinks Austen really wrote about zombies.  He's not hilariously obtuse—he's just playing the communitizing game.  It's like zombies, only with communists and socialists.  I'm surprised (and frankly disappointed) roy didn't pick up on this.  Does he seriously believe conservatives have been so traumatized by three months of a painfully centrist presidency that they're spying pinkos in the hedgerows?  

_As if_.

I can't fault your aesthetic sense -- it's well done, cute -- but I think you're wrong. edroso, too. 

It's more an old Twilight Zone: they're the only ones who can see the signs....

...or textbook paranoia induced by the strategically moderate centrist currently occupying the White House.  Imagine what would happen were a genuine leftist to win one day.

On second thought, don't.  (_shivers_)

_textbook paranoia_

Well, TZ often played with the problem of madness -- how can you tell that you're not insane? -- but I don't really think the problem began with Obama's victory. The creation of Fox News put into play a parallel universe, so to speak, an isolated information culture with radically different inputs and filters; blogs, with their tendency to attract like-minded audiences, exacerbate the problem.
