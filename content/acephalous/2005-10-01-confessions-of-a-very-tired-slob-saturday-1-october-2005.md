You know those days when you wake up with a blistering headache and the conviction that your "sleep" had been poisoned by bland Thai food?  When you wake up, put on a pair of clean pajamas and spend the afternoon half-reading, half-focusing and -unfocusing your eyes?  When you encounter a sink brimming over with soiled dishes and decide to drink Australian wine from a measuring cup?  ("Check out these legs!  Almost eighteen ounces high!")  Such has been my day.  Clutching my measuring cup of cheap Australian wine, I debate the merits of a brie-on-stale-crackers dinner.  I momentarily avoid eating a dinner so unnutritive by thinking about the able demolition of Jonathan Franzen (written by [Ben Marcus](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/fixing\_a\_hole\_w.html#more)) in this month's _Harper's_.  I attempt to write something intelligent about it but am too distracted by the picture of trashiness I currently strike.  The irrational fear that Dell's installed a webcam somewhere on this monster overwhelms.  Ashamed, I hide from the computer for the rest of the evening. 

_Update:_ For those of you who wrote to express concern over my dinner selection, have no fear.  Instead of eating cheese on stale cracked-pepper water-crackers, I generously spread my brie over stale whole-wheat matzah.  It may not be _that_ much more nutritious, but at least the Lord I don't believe in sanctions it.
