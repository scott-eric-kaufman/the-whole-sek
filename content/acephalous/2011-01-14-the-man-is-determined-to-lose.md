Jack Cashill — the man who claims his literary sensibilities rival those of a latter-day [Auerbach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Auerbach) — [proves yet again, again](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/turns-out-i-owe-jack-cashill-an-apology.html), to have problems being intellectually honest.  In “[Obama Does Best When He Says Nothing](http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/01/obama_does_best_when_he_says_n.html),” Cashill compares the President to “Chauncey Gardiner, [who] is the protagonist of Jerzy Kosinski’s 1971 prescient satire, _Being There_, which was later made into a movie of the same name, co-scripted by Kosinski.”   Because his ethos, such as it is, relies so heavily on the impression  that he is a man of letters, he neglects to inform the reader that the  quotations he draws from Kosinski’s “prescient satire” are not, in fact,  [in the novel](http://books.google.com/books?id=B_O3O7NCJNsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=being+there%hl=en&src=bmrr&ei=5dUwTafbDJC4sAOGvPGDBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-preview-link&resnum=1&ved=0CDYQuwUwAA#v=snippet&q=responsibility&f=false).  They are, however, _in the film_.   As I am the last person about to denigrate film as a medium, my point  here is not to belittle Cashill for quoting from a film, but simply to  note that, like most disreputable literary critics, he believes his  credibility relies on always being the first to “lose” a game of  Humiliation.\*

\* From David Lodge’s [_Changing Places_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140170987/diesekoschmar-20):

> He taught them a game he had invented as a postgraduate  student, in which each person had to think of a well-known book he  hadn’t read, and scored a point for every person present who _had_ read it.  The Confederate Soldier and Carol were joint winners, scoring four points out of a possible five with _Steppenwolf_ and _The Story of O_ respectively, Philip in each case accounting for the odd point.  His own nomination, _Oliver Twist_ — usually a certain winner — was nowhere.
> 
> “What do you call that game?” Melanie asked Philip.
> 
> “Humiliation.”
> 
> “That’s a great name.  _Humiliation_ …”
> 
> “You have to humiliate yourself to win, you see.  Or to stop others from winning. (96)

isn't the story that the greatest winner of the game lost her job by confessing she'd never read Hamlet? Or am I misremembering (i.e., inventing)?

You're remembering mostly correctly: it was a he, Philip Swallow, who is alluded to have lost his job in _Small World_.

Actually, I think both of you are misremembering. I think what Karl is thinking of is the Malvolio-esque (and male) American professor, Ringbaum, who in _Changing Places_ is driven by his desperate need to win to admit to never having read _Hamlet_. Then, he's denied tenure because the committee feels they can't in good conscience give tenure to someone who's never read _Hamlet_, and he's still smarting about this in _Small World_. I don't think Philip Swallow ever loses his job--in _Nice Work_ he's still at Rummidge, as chair.

I do believe you're correct, Tomemos.  I'm not sure why I pegged Swallow, despite having the book in front of me.  That said, the reason I felt obliged to quote the passage at length was because I feared not everyone knew from "Humiliation."  I thought it was an English in-joke, but I take it I'm in the wrong there too?

Oh, I think it probably is an in-joke--who knows if I ever would have read any of those books (all of which I enjoyed) if _Nice Work_ hadn't been assigned to me in English class…

Thanks all!

I can't even imagine the kind of self-indulgence a proffie would have to, er, indulge in to assign a 'professors doing things' novel to his/her students.

Oh, this injoke has long since escaped into the wild.

I don't know, Karl. If you're teaching about satire, and want a topic that your students will actually identify with, a satire on academic life would require a lot less explanation than, say, the usual Jonathan Swift, or random McSweeney's droppings.

except that David Lodge/Jane Smiley/Mary McCarthy/Randell Jarrell/Kingsley Amis/Francine Prose/A.S. Byatt campus novels are about professors, not students, at least not primarily. If students dig jokes about academic conferences, departmental meetings, fights with the provost and dean, &c., then more power to them, but I think these are jokes that primarily appeal to me and my ilk, god help us.

For students and satire, there's always The Onion.

This was definitely a strange class. It was on comedy, but after Aristophanes, Plautus, Juvenal, Shakespeare, and Moliere, our reading list got very strange. No Swift, no Wilde, no, I don't know, Louis Carroll or H.L. Mencken—we read _The Red and the Black_, and then _Lucky Jim_, _Nice Work_, Philip Roth's _The Counterlife_ (hardly the funniest Roth book), Stoppard's _Arcadia_, and we watched _Animal House_. That's right--three works on campus life. It was most odd.

Wow. No Chaucer either, then.
