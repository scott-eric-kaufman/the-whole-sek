Ilya Somin's [response](http://volokh.com/2010/08/23/jack-london-socialism-and-progressivism/) to my [London post](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/08/history-of-what-you-make-of-it) is a nifty little walk-back, but he does have a point:

“Progressive” is a general term routinely applied to all  those early 20th century writers and political activists who supported  large-scale increases in government control of the economy.

That's not it.  _That_ is a definition so broad as to be utterly  useless.  The trusts "supported large-scale increases in government  control of the economy" as a means of putting and keeping labor in its  place; manufacturers lobbied first for higher, then lower, then higher  tariffs; but I doubt Somin wants to include those interests among his  "Progressives."  The point he does make is this:

Perhaps Kaufman was confused by my use of a capital “p” rather than a lower-case one.

I was, but only because I applied a standard that's been around for [about a hundred years](http://books.google.com/books?id=IhFJAAAAIAAJ&dq=%!p(MISSING)rogressive%!m(MISSING)ovement%!&(MISSING)pg=PR7#v=onepage&q&f=false) instead of Somin's idiosyncratic non-distinction.  Those who ignore  this distinction typically did so for practical political reasons, like [the fellow](http://books.google.com/books?id=slRaPqoH3hYC&dq=%!p(MISSING)rogressive%!m(MISSING)ovement%!&(MISSING)pg=PR21#v=onepage&q&f=false) who wrote [this introduction](http://books.google.com/books?id=slRaPqoH3hYC&dq=%!p(MISSING)rogressive%!m(MISSING)ovement%!&(MISSING)pg=PR13#v=onepage&q&f=false), who wanted to include lowercase-_p_ progressives under his uppercase-_P_ umbrella in order to make his newly founded party look a little more substantial.

I'm not saying this is a distinction universally upheld, only that  it's more common than not in contemporary scholarship for the simple  reason that most scholars abide by the rules of capitalization: proper  nouns refer to unique entities and are therefore capitalized.  The  niceties of orthography are a side show, however, because the main  problem with Somin's post is that he still claims that London was both  spectacularly racist and, as he wrote in the first post, "no anomaly  among early 20th century Progressives."  London's racism still only  differs in degree, not kind, because as he wrote in the second post, "it  was part of a broader pattern of racism among many Progressives of that  era."

Except that it wasn't.  London's atypical in all respects, and as I  demonstrated in my earlier post, neither part of the "Progressive  movement" proper and only obliquely involved in the humble-mumble of  internecine conflict that defined leftist and liberal politics at the  turn of the last century.  But I've repeated myself.  Very dull.  How  about we venture into [the comments](http://volokh.com/2010/08/23/jack-london-socialism-and-progressivism/comment-page-1/#comment-920654) over there?

It appears that Scott Kaufman is maintaining the faux  history that progressives aren’t either fascists or socialists, when the  plain fact of the matter is that they are both.

Or maybe not.  If elements of that crowd can't tell from my post that London couldn't have been a progressive _because he believed they were insufficiently radical_, the cause is already lost.  But I'm a soldier, so once more [into the breach](http://volokh.com/2010/08/23/jack-london-socialism-and-progressivism/comment-page-1/#comment-920396):

As far as I can tell, Google says that Kaufman is the  only connection between “nature fakir” and Jack London. And, FWIW, that  part about “Darwinian determinism” is nonsense.

Seriously?  The [first return from Google](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B03E7DA133EE033A25753C1A9609C946697D6CF) is too far for someone to tell?  What could be closer?  Wait, wait,  these could be swells of stupidity in an otherwise tempered sea.  Let me  try [one last time](http://volokh.com/2010/08/23/jack-london-socialism-and-progressivism/comment-page-1/#comment-919973):

If you’d like a detailed look at it I’d suggest Jonah Goldberg’s _Liberal Fascism_. Like the excesses of Communism, most of this has simply been written out of history.

Uncle.

As a "republican," Sarah Palin must have supported the salting of Carthage in the wake of the Third Punic War.

Off topic (this is all really about Scott and Ilya and Jack, with Jonah looming grandly in the background), but during the period 1900-1910 were there any American authors who made a significant number of statements about racial questions without making any racist statements? This is not necessarily a rhetorical questio0n. 

I still hold a grudge about Democrats, of all people, accusing the Populists of racism. My own preliminary research tells me that almost everyone was anti-Catholic except the Catholics, almost everyone was anti-Semitic except the Jews, almost everyone was anti-black except the blacks, and everyone was anti-Chinese -- though from time to time most were willing to make  pragmatic adjustments to their principles on these questions.

_during the period 1900-1910 were there any American authors who made a significant number of statements about racial questions without making any racist statements? This is not necessarily a rhetorical question._ 

Twain's anti-imperialist sentiments never turned anti-Spanish, and a whole slew of African-American writers like James Wheldon Johnson spent most of their time attacking or defending W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington from one another.  Frank Norris's depictions of migrant workers and Upton Sinclair's treatment of foreigners in _The Jungle_ were both sympathetic.  That's off the top of my head, which admittedly is a bit dull after a day of reading Pierce on indexicality.  (Don't ask.)

Foreigners and migrant workers can be white, though. Knut Hamsun was both of those (in Minnesota) and a Nazi too. 

And I've heard Twain described as racist, and not just for "Huckleberry Finn". IIRC, while defending the Fiipinos against US aggression he referred to them as naked savages.

Proving a negative is supposedly impossible, but not if you have a given corpus.

A "plain fact," eh?  That's some serious fail right there.  But I guess Jonah Goldberg's already blazed that trail.

John Emerson has a point.  Racialist thinking was pretty much taken for granted amongst turn-of-the-century U.S. writers; you'll even find Du Bois in his early work making statements about the "Negro race"'s essential good-nature, love of dance, etc., that make readers wince today.  It wasn't until Franz Boas's brilliant demolition of racialist thinking in The Mind of Primitive Man that a significant number of social scientists and other educated readers began to seriously question the idea that there are distinct races with essential, negative and positive qualities.  

So, yes, like virtually everyone writing between 1900 and 1910, progressives tended to make racist statements.

These arguments are bizarre. One factor is that MLK has been a saint for 42 years now, and kids have grown up learning that and getting a day off school, so he has to be recruited by every political position, or at least neutralized  (just like Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln, whose actual political positions are usually ignored by people claiming to affiliate with them.)

Likewise overt racism is taboo, even though everyone remains a bit racist, or a lot. So "racist" is defined to mean a big fat tobacco chewing Southern sheriff releasing attack dogs on little children, and people are infuriated if you call them racist for anything less than that.

As a result of the new taboo, though, anyone can zero in on the heroes and ancestors of anyone else and prove that they were racists, since almost everyone was (and my bet is that when we do finally find a 1910 non-racist, they will be so eccentric or utopian or mystical or sectarian that no one really can claim them).

As I've said elsewhere, my interest in this argument comes from the way Hofstadter and others used it (along with other arguments)  to discredit the Populists and the Progressives in "The Age of Reform", a book which is regarded as authoritative for a large chunk of the liberal intelligentsia.

But who is progressives, precious?  (_Ahem_.)  I mean, Stephen, you're replicating the very error I'm thwumping here.

Precious?  Am I Frodo or the ring?

Small "p" progressive is as nebulous a term as "liberal" is today.  But yes, reformers whom we today think of as progressives tended to distinguish themselves from outright socialists like London.  At the same time, there was significant overlap between the two groups (Doug Rossinow has a great book on this - Visions of Progress).

Regarding the fakir stuff, didn't TR use "nature faker?" I remember running across that in the last few days (annoyingly I can't find the citation, though I was just reading Hofstadter). I see the "fakir" too, but I just wondered about using it instead.

Note that the American founders held slaves and had some racist sentiments (and didn't want women to vote, etc, yet most patriotic Americans don't consider that a smear against the basic principles behind the Constitution, American government etc. The way it works: if people don't like a movement, they'll pretend that the faults of its founders/early actors are relevant derogations, but if they like the movement then it will be considered unfortunate personal shortcomings that don't matter.
