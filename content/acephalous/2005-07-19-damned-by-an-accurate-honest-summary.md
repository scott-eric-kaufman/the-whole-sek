## Damned by an Accurate, Honest Summary?

A couple of months back, I [outlined](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/how\_to\_open\_an\_\_3.html) the argument of Donald Pease's "Psychoanalyzing the Narrative Logics of Naturalism."  Scratch that: I tried and failed to outline his argument.  Donna Campbell--author of the "Fiction: 1900 to the 1930s" section of the most recent _American Literary Scholarship_--summarizes Pease's argument as follows:
[It] refutes previous criticism by taking issue with Mark Seltzer’s idea that narrative control is restored at the end of _The Call of the Wild_. ‘‘Buck’’ appears first as a signifier of the Judge’s property and then as ‘‘the agent’’ of the panoptic ‘‘free indirect discourse’’ through which Buck’s thoughts are narrated, but he still escapes ‘‘the normative control of the disciplinary society’’ through his communication with Thornton. Buck’s dreams, which reproduce authentic free indirect discourse, and the instantaneous, extrarational impulses through which Buck and Thornton communicate escape the narrative’s foreclosure of ‘‘the disciplinary society’s foundational violence’’ in those passages in which the ‘‘libidinal intensities’’ of Buck’s are set in motion.

Her summary, curiously devoid of affect or judgment, strikes me as criticism by paraphrase.  It's as if she's reluctant to criticize a major figure in the field and has decided instead to let his argument sink on its own merits.  Her direct quotations almost insinuate that the argument works despite the thickets of jargon; then again, maybe it fails on account of its reliance on jargon.  To be frank, I can't tell what Campbell thinks of the argument.  

And I believe that ambiguity might, itself, be damning.

I hope Donna Campbell is being sarcastic in her summation. It SHOULD be. It HAS to be. P(l)ease.

The thing is, I don't even see sarcasm there.  I see deadened prose, _murdered_ prose; prose buried, _if buried_, in the shallowest of graves...and I assume the flattening's the result of her being Donna Campbell and Pease running the yearly Americanist boot-camp up at Brown.  Which, I should add, I haven't attended but have heard wonderful things about.  Granted, the people I've heard from are, for lack of a better phrase, "theoretically gullible in the extreme," but still: if someone of Pease's stature is willing to shepherd five or six more lowly graduate students into his flock every single year, you have to grant the man more than a modicum of respect.  That's _commitment_.  And given the number of tenured faculty who couldn't give two shits about the future of the students they mentor, Pease's commitment to his students' futures is entirely and absolutely commendable.

That said, I'm still really _really_ fuzzy about the substance, and more to the point, the _stakes_ of his argument.  What's gained by the refutation of Seltzer?  (Alright, I'm now channelling my advisor.  Stakes?  Gains?  I've internalized the literary market _qua_ market metaphor that's been hammered and hammered and hammered into my head since I switched advisors...)
