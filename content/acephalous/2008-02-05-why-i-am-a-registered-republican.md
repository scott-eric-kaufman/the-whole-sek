## Why I am a Registered Republican

I've got nothing.\*  

(Next thing you know, random government officials will inform me of my lifelong commitment to the Yankees.)

That's not exactly true: Back in 2000, I registered as a Republican so I could vote against Bush in the California primary.  But I've renewed my driver's license twice since then—2001 and 2006—and have been listed as an independent on the rolls when I've voted.  I can only suppose Republican must be the default affiliation in Orange County, or that the Clinton camp caught wind of my preference for Obama and attempted (unsuccessfully) to force me to vote for Ron Paul.

You realize, of course, that this is why the forces of karma have been dumping all sorts of crap on you. 

You need to fix that and then burn some incense in all the corners of your house. You might also want to check which direction your front door is facing.

So, did you:   

- Vote in the Republican Primary as a spoiler?  

- Challenge the registration and vote as a Democrat?  

- Go home in disgust?

It took them about 45 minutes to figure out how, but eventually I was allowed to fill out a form, register as a Democrat, and cast a provisional ballot.  

(And Sisyphus, if I were a Republican, I'd be up to my eyeballs in Heritage Foundation grants, so no evil would befall me.)

(At least not money-related.  Who knows, maybe I would've actually donated to the library.)

I'm a Decline to State.   I also vote absentee.   

This time I forgot to request a Dem absentee ballot, and also lost my DtS absentee ballot.

Just went down, showed my ID, and filled out a provisional Dem ballot.  Snip snap.

Just curious ... are you sure they made you register as a Dem?

Oh, I see you said they showed you as GOP.  Sorry, never mind.

Man, I'm with Sisyphus on this.

As John Milton might have said: 'sure I joined the Devil's Party.  But it was only so that I could throw my weight behind Beelzebub in the Hell elections, and stop that Satan fellow gaining ultimate power.'

My little bro's been a registered Republican all his adult life.  But even he says he'll vote for Obama over McCain in the general election if it comes to it.  And this is from a guy who, at age 6, penned a letter to the local newspaper that earned him an invitation letter from the local John Birch society!

I know I'm coming to this late, but in some states, you don't register by party. You simply register. Then when you vote in a party primary, the name of the party is stamped on your voter registration card. Such is Texas. 

Louisiana is an entirely different ball of wax.... Isn't is SEK?
