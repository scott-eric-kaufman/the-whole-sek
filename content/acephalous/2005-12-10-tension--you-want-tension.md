## Tension?  You Want Tension?

I first drafted this entry early Wednesday evening.  I often draft posts days before I publish them.  I had no reason to be nervous. __(_Suggested routine?  Check.  Irrelevent emotional detail?  Check._)  

I sat in my study, unprepared for this. __(_Ominous pronoun?  Check.  Withheld information?  Check._)  It would be some time before I ate solid food again.  (_Solemn futural perspective?  Check.  Red herring?  Check._)  

I placed the Afrin on my desk next to the handset I should have charged.  (_Intimate detail?  Check.  Intimated communication crisis?  Check._)  

This sort of thing happens all the time.  But not me. __(_Implied hubris?  Check.  Insinuated invincibility?  Check._)  I heard the phone ring but I let the machine answer.  The man on the machine said he wanted to know some simple techniques for creating cheap tension.  I told him I couldn't help him.  He insisted I could.  My phone was dying.  I told him he should try overstating the obvious and he thanked me for my time.  I didn't expect to hear back from him.  Random phone calls never lead to anything.  Certainly not this.

Then I sneezed.  I knew this week would not end well.  If only I had known.

Clever. I had to read it twice. I was too tense and on guard to believe the joke the first time.  

P.S. _Proofread? No_  "end well"

Nothing so cryptic: I stressed how to create narrative tension this quarter where none naturally exists, and I scribbled down some of the better constructions as I proofed the kids' articles.  Then I combined them into this exemplum of cheap tension.
