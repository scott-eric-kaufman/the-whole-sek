## How do you disappear completely, come back for your qualifiers, disappear completely <em>again</em>, return for your prospectus, &c.?

We all know That Guy.  Entered the program the year Clinton entered the White House and chugged along until he earned a Master's.  Buggered off until Bush's inauguration and had his prospectus approved that September.  Trekked into the Himalayas and returned the day Obama was elected with two chapters in hand and a plan to finish the dissertation by the first day of The One's second term.

How did That Guy do it?  What did he do when the three quarters in which he was allowed on a leave of absence ended?  Was he independently wealthy and dishing out $4,000 per quarter for years on end?  Did he leave the program and reapply every time he wanted to advance his degree some infinitesimal step?  

(I only ask because I want to know what happens to hypothetical people married to That Guy when That Guy's teaching runs out.)

Too much fun with technorati tags indeed.

Why not suppose that he had the job that every male graduate student has at least once fantasized about? Someone in my program has spent several years after graduation as a househusband.  The other students said it was professional suicide, but it sure sounded like sour grapes to me.

My understanding is that That Guy has a very very small penis.

I'm that guy.  Well, apart from the small penis, two chapters, and a plan.

At ye olde seminary, our continuation fees are only $1600, so stretch out the timeline proportionately to get a portrait of our That Guys.

Adjuncting to pay the bills. Cheap tuition. Taking time off from work to write full time is only for the independently wealthy.

Here's the rundown.  Enrolled in Grad School in 1999, pass field exams in 2002.  Leave of absence to live and work with partner in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  My father dies while I am away... complete loss of direction.  First child born in 2003.  Return to states and work as adjunct professor while also being the primary caretaker for my first son (house-husband).  Advance to candidacy in 2005 and then spend a considerable amount of time waiting for a field work opportunity to open in Tajikistan.  2006 begin field work in Ferghana valley - 2007 finish field work, have 2nd baby-- 2007 til now... completely stalled.  Presently I'm looking for a job and trying to find a way to dig myself out of what amounts to a completely self-indulgent form of writers block... any suggestions?

throw in a few bouts of depression and you've got the picture.

Well, one way it works is for That Guy to have various sort of jobs that get the bills paid (barely) and a program that allows him to quasi-drop out.  A lot of programs are loath to admit that someone has packed it in and left academia altogether, and a lot of people are loath to admit that they've packed it in and left academia altogether.  As for That Guy's spouse, as other commentators have mentioned, she's often paying the bills during that liminal stage in which he's gradually ceasing to become an academic.

She becomes the granting agency, and still doesn't see him. And when she does, he's depressed.
