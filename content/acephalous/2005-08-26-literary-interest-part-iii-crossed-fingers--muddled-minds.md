Welcome to Part III of my continuing attempt to understand Steven Knapp’s _Literary Interest_
and come to terms with its implications.  (In what follows it’s
possible that I demonstrate a constitutional inability to do either. 
Feel free to say so without worrying about my feelings.  You could
stuff my pride in a thimble and still have plenty of room for a thumb, _i.e._ I would rather be right eventually than wrong in perpetuity.)

[Commenting](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/08/all\_my\_vintage\_.html#comment-8838125) on my [second (still muddled) attempt](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/08/all\_my\_vintage\_.html) to pin down Knapp’s argument, [Adam Stephanides](http://completelyfutile.blogspot.com/) argues

The primary question Knapp is asking in this chapter is
whether it is possible for a work of literature to necessarily mean
something other than what the author intended it to mean, using _Paradise Lost_ as a test case. As would be expected from the co-author of “Against Theory,” Knapp’s answer is “no."

I read that section under the same assumption and came to the same
conclusion (though I neglected to mention it in that post).  My entire
discussion assumed that the point toward which Knapp marched would
marshal against all arguments resembling “the Romantic Argument,” _i.e._ ones in which the critic rescues the coherence of the intended world at the expense of the author’s intentions.  On [The Valve](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/how\_the\_marx\_brothers\_embark\_or\_steven\_knapps\_literary\_interest\_and\_its\_imp/), [HZ](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/how\_the\_marx\_brothers\_embark\_or\_steven\_knapps\_literary\_interest\_and\_its\_imp/#3701) forwards a different but not necessarily contradictory interpretation:

So, Knapp wants to know:  What is the payoff of treating literary works _as if_
they had a a “special kind of representational structure, each of whose
elements acquires, by virtue of its connection with other elements, a
network of associations inseparable from the representation itself.”
What are we interested in when we are interested in _THAT_?

HZ’s account diminishes the importance of the prescriptive angle
Adam and I believe to be entailed by his local statements.  Granted,
assessing these statements outside the global context of _Literary Interest_
encouraged the speculation that led to my misrepresentating Knapp’s
larger claims.  (The first person who acknowledges the resemblence of
my misinterpretation to the type of misinterpretation Knapp calls “the
Romantic Argument” wins August’s Meta-Award for Meta-Awareness.) While
HZ almost convinces me that Knapp’s interest in “literary interest” is
disinterested, my experience reading Walter Benn Michaels suggests
otherwise.  (Not that I think there’s a one-to-one correspondence
between the two.  However, given the vehemence with which they argued
in “[Against Theory](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0093-1896%!(NOVERB)
