## Language is revealing that Dan Riehl is a racist.

			Via someone named “[davenoon](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/09/i-beat-shit-out-of-some-kids-today-but.html),” I learn that someone named Dan Riehl recently encountered some black people who “[were technically _thugs_](http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous\_conservative/2009/09/a-912-experience-dangerous-times.html).” What did these “technically _thug[gish]_”
black people do? “There was no confrontation,” Riehl informs his
readers, but “there were maybe ten or so” of them in the bus, which is
about nine or so more than is required to trigger a flight-or-flight
response in folks like Riehl. Somehow, he managed to keep it together
long enough to hear what these “pretty young, not that big” black
“kids” were saying, which he transcribed for the sensitive ears of his
readers thusly:
Without resorting to the poor diction it was along the lines of, these are the people who think Obama is the anti-Christ.

Why these “pretty young, not that big [black kids who] were technically _thugs_”
resorted along the lines of the poor diction Riehl employs is, I
confess, a bit confusing. I believe the problem is that Riehl believes they are “technically _thugs_,” when in reality they are only “_technically_
thugs,” meaning that they’re not thugs at all, but well-dressed young
black conservatives on their way to celebrate Glenn Beck Day along with
the likes of Dan Riehl. But that is just me resorting to the good
hypothesis about the poor diction without seeing what exactly what they
said was along the lines of, which was this:

That McCain he wasn’t chit.

It seems Riehl needs glasses, because it sounds like he was seated
in front of ten or so terrible caricatures of Latino gangstas or, given
how poor his ear for dialogue is along the lines of, possibly the [Clay Davis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUjh9Id6Id8) [family](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QNB4wMH3PU) [reunion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QpWKu98h3I). Fortunately for all involved, these kids who were only “_technically_ thugs” behaved as kids who are only “_technically_ thugs” do:

It went on but not really to a level that was so loud, or so confrontational that it needed to be addressed.

By “it,” Riehl means “they,” but don’t chalk that “it” up to poor diction: for Riehl and those like him, _all_ black kids, even when they’re “pretty young [and] not that big,” are “_technically_ thugs” and, as such, are undeserving of a pronoun that refers along the lines of people instead of things.

Confusing, yes; I thought Dan Riehl was attributing the statement that "these people" (i.e. Riehl and his white seatmates) think Obama is the anti-Christ to the technical thugs in the back of the train.

Yeah, me too; it's amazingly badly-written.  It's also weird that he goes from the very stilted "these people think Obama is the anti-Christ" to "that McCain he wasn't chit."

Scott, you're pulling your punches again. You left out one of the most perfectly garbled sentences ever attempted by a purported native speaker of the English Language (of blessed memory):

_I can't say as I'm not concerned that America might not end up more racially divided than we've been in 30 years._

Good catch, Ahist. Let's do the math. I think he means:

I can say as [ed: that] I am concerned\* that American might not end up more racially divided that we've been in 30 years."

Is that what he means? He's concerned that we are (where "we" = "America"?) NOT going to be as "racially divided" as we were in 1979? So his dream is for...what?

Anyway, what was significant about 1979? So far as I know, in 1979, before Reagan ended the War on Poverty in 1981, racial divisions by income (for example) were bad, but nowhere near as bad as they are, say, now. 

\* note, I realize that "I can't say that I'm not concerned" does not necessarily = "I can say that I am concerned," since the reason he can't say might be "...because my mouth is full of packing peanuts: a low-fat and crunchy snack!" However, in this instance, I think I'm fair in hazarding this reading.

Basically, I can believe this guy called you stupid, Scott, only because he's so obviously stupid.

Karl, I think we have to go the other way. Start with the postive statement:

_I'm concerned that America might end up more racially divided than we've been in 30 years._

(No, I don't know what it is about the '70s: something about "inner cities" and "white flight," perhaps? Or the decline in blaxploitation cinema? Maybe it's the pre-Michael Jackson racial divide in musical genres?)

Then add a negative, a negative, and a negative..... Yeah. He's worried that racial tensions might go down, which would be bad for his job security. But he can't say that, because it would be bad for his job security.

Ahist: I think that's probably what he intended to have written, but that's certainly not what came out! To play the Freudian for a moment, there are no accidents.

At any rate, 1979 really makes no sense. If he'd gone with 40 or 45 years, or, hell, 100 years....but to take this seriously, as for the pre-Michael Jackson divide....Disco was still popular in 1979, and, whatever its whiteness, it also combined soul and a key segment of gay culture. Bracketing off country and western music, I'd say it's punk and New Wave and their growth into 1980s top-40 that instituted a sharp racial divide in musical tastes in America, at least until a love of hiphop became de rigeur for all the youths.

_that's certainly not what came out! ... At any rate, 1979 really makes no sense._

No argument from me, on any point. I think "thirty years" is a tic based on a rosy view of the Reagan '80s. _Everything_ was worse in the '70s, if you're a Reaganite. It's the only way to truly appreciate the greatness of the man.... making stuff up. Like Reagan did.

I read Riehl's column as saying that the "black kids" must have overheard something Riehl and his companions were talking about that offended them and made them think they (Riehl and friends) were anti-Obama, and the kids responded by loudly saying something along the lines of, "These (Riehl and company) are the people who think Obama is the anti-Christ." 

Riehl is completely racist. Why are the kids described as thugs, technically or otherwise? A thug is, "a cruel or vicious ruffian, robber, or murderer." The kids did not rob, murder, or bully anyone. Nor did they break the law. Nor were they cruel. One or two kids spoke somewhat loudly from a distance. 

I particularly love Riehl's tough-guy stance: "And if the several adults there for 9/12 actually needed to do something about it, the kids wouldn't have lasted very long." 

Only a racist would feel so threatened by kids who were, "wannabes really, pretty young, not that big, or many." Yet in order to feel good about himself, he has to posture in his blog. Blog-posturing makes Riehl so tough, eh what?

It's clear Riehl and his friends felt threatened. He writes with such seriousness! I don't have to wonder whether a group of white kids, "wannabes really, pretty young, not that big, or many," who said the same exact thing would have elicited a second look from Riehl. I know they wouldn't have. And he would not have been been blog-posturing about taking them out, if need be.   

And the sad thing is he doesn't know he's a racist. He thinks he had a reasonable response to the situation.
