## Faith maintenance

It turns out Dan Riehl is as adept at [reading words](http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous\_conservative/2010/09/my-apologies-and-more-genuine-response-to-michael-gerson.html) as [situations](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/language-is-revealing-that-dan-riehl-is-a-racist.html):

I should apologize and confess to having previously torn off a quick, mostly hyperbolic and silly [rant](http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2010/09/19/top-bush-aide-denounces-mark-levin-malkin-others-unhinged-bolshevik-part) in response to [this by Michael Gerson](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2010/09/the\_childish\_political\_thought.html).  I read through it, but right over my name, as well. So, I didn’t think  Mr. Gerson was genuinely interested in what bloggers might actually  think until now. [h/t Newsbusters](http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2010/09/19/top-bush-aide-denounces-mark-levin-malkin-others-unhinged-bolshevik-part).

Translation:

Until someone else pointed out that he’d quoted me, I didn’t think he was interested in what people like me have to say.

That’s a remarkable confession when you think about it, and says  quite a bit about the current state of conservative blogs: everyone  assumes they know what everyone else is thinking, so they stop reading  what they actually write but continue to attack each other anyway.  As  far as I can gather—[it’s](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=21168) [rather](http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous\_conservative/2010/09/allahpundit-gets-desperate-for-help-in-smearing-christine-odonnell.html) [confusing](http://patterico.com/2010/09/18/christine-odonnell-in-1999-i-dabbled-in-witchcraft/)—it  seems like the purity test of the week is not whether conservatives  will be pragmatic and advocate voting for Christine O’Donnell, but  whether they will hold their tongue or speak their piece about her  obvious flaws as a candidate while doing so. Were I a fiscal  conservative, I’d be bothered by the disconnect between her life and her  professed ideals to the point of questioning whether the latter were  nothing more than lip service; but as I am, for the most part, just  chuffed that the Republicans of Delaware selected an unelectable  candidate, I don’t feel the need to weigh in.

Not even on the Donalde’s [latest self-deflating argument](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/anti-intellectualism-and-marxist-idea.html),  because I’m increasingly convinced that he’s engaged in some sort of  performance art.  No actual human, much less a teacher, could consider [this](http://bjkeefe.blogspot.com/2010/09/take-shovel-away-from-donald-douglas.html?showComment=1284824860748#c2502128766693934933) an invitation to debate, or respond to its inevitable (and quite reasonable) rejection by issuing the following complaint:

There’s a word for this: Anti-intellectualism. And that  stance marinates in a devilish sauce of hard left-wing hubris and  deceit. It’s further soaked in hatred, for to hate one’s enemies is to  categorize them as beyond the pale of reason and civilization.

The worst thing about this cooking show?  The Donalde spent [_all night_](http://twitter.com/AmPowerBlog/status/25016620453) writing the script.  So my choices are “sad, sad little man” or  “brilliant performance artist,” and because I want to maintain my faith  in humanity, I’m going with the latter.

Thanks for noticing the Donald's performance on my blog.  It _was_ pretty entertaining, wasn't it?
