Such is the power of blog.  

I watched [_Wristcutters: A Love Story_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0012E2GFK/diesekoschmar-20) for the same reason I've watched many a quirky, middlebrow film: Tom Waits.  True to form, the film exuded a quirky, middlebrow charm.  But it featured "Through the Roof," by Gogol Bordello, which you must listen to.  From the film:




A (possibly _the_, but what do I know?) complete video:




The tired, tossed off absurdity of the chorus comes from the Shane McGowan School of Lyric.  Would that graduates were more plentiful and sober.

Through some complicated set of zine orders, my wife got a copy of _Bipolar_, the alt-comic book in which  was serialized.   was the eventual graphic novel adaptation of Etgar Keret's short story "Kneller's Happy Campers," which was also the source material for _Wristcutters_. (Woo boy, that's a lot of dependent clauses.  Glad I broke it into two sentences.)  So by the time I eventually watched the film, I knew the basic premise and arc of the story, and yet was utterly charmed by the adaptation.  I think it's a quietly wonderful film.

By the way, if you (or others)are looking for a further exploration of Gogol Bordello, I personally recommend "Super Taranta!" over "Gypsy Punks" as a place to start.

OK, I did something wrong there.  The words "Pizzeria Kamikaze" should have come between "which" and "was" in the first sentence, and at the beginning of the second sentence.

Etgar Keret and Gogol Bordello, together?  What a find!  Smarmeriffic!  Hipstacular!

And the guy from _Down by Law_ is in it too, huh?
