Mark Helprin—author of my [favorite novel](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156001942/diesekoschmar-20) when I was a naive fourteen—published [another](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122965053466920579.html) well-written, ur-conservative editorials in the _Wall Street Journal_ today.  You can (and will) disagree with the sentiment, but you must admit that the man can control his clauses:

The pity is that the war could have been successful and
this equilibrium sustained had we struck immediately, preserving the
link with September 11th; had we disciplined our objective to forcing
upon regimes that nurture terrorism the choice of routing it out with
their ruthless secret services or suffering the destruction of the
means to power for which they live; had we husbanded our forces in the
highly developed military areas of northern Saudi Arabia after deposing
Saddam Hussein, where as a fleet in being they would suffer no
casualties and remain at the ready to reach Baghdad, Damascus, or
Riyadh in three days; and had we taken strong and effective measures
for our domestic protection while striving to stay within
constitutional limits and eloquently explaining the necessity—as has
always been the case in war—for sometimes exceeding them.

The children [on the] (http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTFhYzM0OGM0MjAyYTc0ZWUzMjljMDVhZDlmMzQzNzY=)_[Corner](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTFhYzM0OGM0MjAyYTc0ZWUzMjljMDVhZDlmMzQzNzY=)_ think otherwise.  According to Peter Wehner, Helprin’s editorial is both wrong _and_ chock-full
of “very sloppy writing.”  The above soundly refutes the sloppiness
argument, but you should know better than to expect sound arguments
from people who think “Charles Krauthammer [is] America’s best
columnist and one of our finest geopolitical thinkers.”  My favorite
bits:

This is an example of very sloppy writing on the part of _Helprin_…

I gather that _Helprin_ is lamenting the fact that we did not
attack Iraq immediately after 9/11.  But we could barely attack
Afghanistan immediately after September 11, 2001, and Afghanistan
required a strategic innovation that _Halperin_ totally ignores…

Reading between the lines, his use of the word “eloquently” probably translates into “we need more speeches written by Mark _Halperin_.” It’s worth recalling, then, that _Helprin_’s
most notable speechwriting achievement to date was penning Robert
Dole’s 1996 acceptance speech, arguing that Dole would be our Bridge to
the Past. The speech was a bust, and helped contribute to Dole’s loss
to Bill Clinton…

_Helprin_ is right that many Democrats have been feckless.
 But if everyone from George W. Bush to Democrats have been
feckless—and surely _Helprin_ would throw in every other global ally on that spectrum, too—then _Halperin_
is saying everybody, but him, has got it wrong. This is akin to the man
on the highway who is going the wrong way and talks to his wife on the
phone about how many morons are going the wrong way.

However would he know what _that_ feels like?

If parallel clauses are an occasion for celebration, we're in serious rhetorical doodoo for shizzle.

This is not related to the post, but I thought you might like to know that Pynchon's new novel (due out 8/09) is available for pre-order on Amazon:

[http://www.amazon.com/Inherent-Vice-Thomas-Pynchon/dp/1594202249/ref=sr\_1\_10?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229853691&sr=1-10](http://www.amazon.com/Inherent-Vice-Thomas-Pynchon/dp/1594202249/ref=sr\_1\_10?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229853691&sr=1-10)

It's a small one -- 416 pages -- but hopefully it's better than \*Against the Day\*.

Luther, you say words like a crazy man would.  _Against the Day_ is probably my favourite Pynchon.

Thanks for the heads up, Luther.  And Adam, really?  I mean, _really_?  Because, truth be told, I didn't finish it.  Put differently: I didn't feel compelled to finish it.  One day I will---although I wonder, as I age, whether that truism's got any truth left in it---but I'm more likely to give his next novel a shot than I am to delve back into _Against the Day_ anytime soon.

Here's info on the book, and an image of the cover:

[http://www.hyperarts.com/thomas-pynchon/inherent-vice.html](http://www.hyperarts.com/thomas-pynchon/inherent-vice.html)

It looks like a Jimmy Buffett album, and it sounds like a Tom Robbins novel.  

Adam, you make me want to re-read \*Against the Day\*.  My problem was this: it seemed like Pynchon writing a "Pynchon" novel.  I see this all the time with aging rock bands.  Take Sonic Youth.  They pioneered new sounds, they created a whole world of influenced bands (like Pavement), and then they started losing steam.  In reaction, they began doing "Sonic Youth" albums, rather than albums by Sonic Youth.

It has something to do with "late style."  Novelists who want to have long careers can keep pushing their art (Henry James), or they can write the same novel again and again (Kurt Vonnegut), or they can decline (Faulkner), or they can try to rekindle the early flame (Pynchon).  With \*Vineland\* and \*Mason & Dixon\*, I thought he was developing a late-ish style, something more humane than his early work, something elegiac almost.  But \*Against the Day\* seems like an attempt to re-do \*Gravity's Rainbow\*.  It seems underwritten, toneless at times, struggling to get the characters here and there rather than to develop them, full of functional sentences rather than Pynchon's heartbreaking and arch lines of \*Mason & Dixon\*.  It's full of saying rather than showing: no dramatic approach, lots of summarizing narration.  Toni Morrison's recent novels suffer similarly, and it makes me wonder about the pressures of publishing contracts.  

My impression was that \*Against the Day\* needed another 500 pages and another few years to simmer.

Hmm.  Last year I posted a mammoth and, though I say so myself, brilliant defence of _Against the Day_ (enlarging upon [this review what I wrote of the novel](http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2007/02/against\_the\_day.shtml)) on this very thread.  I return to check out the site in the new year and it's gone.  Not there, I tell ya.  Why's that?  Was it SEK-suppressed?  I mean, first the credit crunch, and now this.

I'm not seeing it in my spam queue or in a Gmail search, Adam.  Either you're _lying_, you liar, or, um, the internet broke?

Well, the internet _is_ notoriously frangible ...
