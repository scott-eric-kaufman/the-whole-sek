[At the _Corner_](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/356191/cnn-films-hires-inconvenient-truth-producer-andrew-johnson), Andrew Johnson thinks it's great news for Hillary that CNN's film division hired Courtney Sexton_:_

After the 
RNC  voted the network from hosting future presidential debates if it  
follows through on plans to produce a Hillary Clinton documentary, the  
network’s films division has announced it will bring on film executive  
Courtney Sexton, who has a long history of working on left-leaning  
flicks.

_Deadline_ [details](http://www.deadline.com/2013/08/cnn-films-hires-courtney-sexton/) that Sexton’s past works include Al Gore’s climate-change documentary _An Inconvenient Truth_, as well as 2010’s _[Climate of Change](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1563712/)_, which __ “focused
 on the efforts of everyday people all over the world who are making a 
difference in the fight against global warming” ...

“Any concerns the Clinton team had are all gone,” RNC communications director Sean Spicer [told](http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2013/08/rnc-cnn-films-hiring-courtney-sexton-puts-the-p-in-170793.html) _Politico_ in an email in reaction to the announcement. “This puts the ‘p’ in ‘puff piece.’”

Talk about punting the story. Sexton worked on _Deadwood_. If we use Johnson and Spicer's deterministic logic, that means we'll soon be seeing a completely different side of Hillary:

ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE: BE BRIEFED!

HILLARY: [BE FUCKED](http://youtu.be/d6b9yvGzyLw)!

Or:

PRESIDENT OBAMA: Hillary, your presence at the UN Commission on --

HILLARY: [I don't drink where I'm the only fucking one with balls](http://youtu.be/kKEZbgaqJWo?t=14s).

Can't say I'm not looking forward to this.
