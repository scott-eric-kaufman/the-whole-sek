_SEK was driving to the Winn-Dixie, 
about a block away from his house, when a man ran into the street waving
 his arms wildly. SEK pulled over, thinking the man’d just chopped off 
some vital extremity with his lawnmower or something._

**SEK:** You need help?

**MAN:** Hey, you don’t live around here, do you?

**SEK:** I — are you all right?

**MAN:** I don’t know you.

**SEK:** I live just around the corner (_SEK said, pointing to his domicile_).

**MAN:** [Your music](http://youtu.be/gRYid1dKLco) was really loud.

**SEK:** I’m deaf, so sometimes it gets a little loud. Sorry about that, I’ll try to –

**MAN:** What’s with your hat? Is that a gang thing?

**SEK:** !?!

**MAN:** Well?

**SEK:** It’s a lazy thing. Didn’t feel like combing my hair this morning. I’ve gotta get back home soon, get to work, you know?

**MAN:** –

_And SEK drove off. On the way home, this Zimmermaning neighbor waved at SEK as he drove by._
