			**SEK’S LESBIAN FRIEND:** Crap — just realized I won’t be able to make your birthday party.

**SEK:** That’s fine. I didn’t want to play any Indigo Girls songs anyway.

**SEK’S LESBIAN FRIEND:** You were the one who introduced me to the Indigo Girls! Just play your favorite so I can attend in spirit.

**SEK:** Fine — I’ll play “[The Wood Song](https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.youtube.com%!F(MISSING)watch%!F(MISSING)v%!D(MISSING)djvIWPJ\_zXc&h=qAQFdvnqc).”

**SEK’S LESBIAN FRIEND:** Your favorite Indigo Girl’s song is “The Wood Song”?

**SEK:** Yes.

**SEK’S LESBIAN FRIEND:** “THE _WOOD_ SONG”?

**SEK:** What? It’s gorgeous.

**SEK’S LESBIAN FRIEND:** “THE **_WOOD_** SONG”?

**SEK:** Fine — “Romeo and Juliet” then.

**SEK’S LESBIAN FRIEND:** _WRITTEN BY A MAN_!

**SEK:** How am I losing this argument?

**SEK’S LESBIAN FRIEND:** God damn straight people.
