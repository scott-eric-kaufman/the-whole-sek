			[Proffer theories as to the avocation I undertook presently](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/06/a-lexigraphical.html). You guessed it! I spent the day marking papers, [which, means I had, many reminders of](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/11/what-is-it-with-students-and-with-commas.html) why teaching [Writingstudents, even at the Universitylevel](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/thesis-writing-formal-essays-turns-certain-people-into-germans.html), can make even the most mild-mannered academic want to [JAB IN EYES JAB IN EYES](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/03/grading.html).   

(Actual posts to recommence when the noises in my head resemble English more than 
[English as she is spoke](http://books.google.com/books?id=e0FhX6ddHfEC&dq=%!E(MISSING)nglish%!a(MISSING)s%!s(MISSING)he%!i(MISSING)s%!s(MISSING)poke.%!&(MISSING)num=100&client=firefox-a&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q=&f=false).

ALSO: 

Because it's always best to make this plain from the beginning [SEK says to the readers at _LGM_], on the issue of whether my students know what I'm writing:  

With
the exception of the text adventure, [what I post is] written to be
used in class, then repurposed for the blog. I show them videos of
Shatner and ask them if that's what they want to sound like; I have
them write blog posts (for their course blogs) in which they're
required to substitute every noun and verb with suggestions from
Microsoft Word's thesaurus, etc. Whenever I write about conversations
in the classroom ([for example](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/11/the-great-calif.html)),
I ask the students if they're alright with that ... and as I'm
typically the butt of those posts, they always are. In fact, by the end
of the quarter, they're actually _demanding_ I write up what happened in a given class ([for example](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/some-words-are-best-avoided-when-your-nose-starts-to-tickle.html)). Even [the most notorious bit of student writing I've parodied](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/and\_yet\_i\_still.html) was done with the student's consent. (It was years ago, and he wrote me out of the blue to apologize for writing it.)

Marking papers is horrid. I'm marking papers right now! Right now! Halfway through something like 100 1500-word essays on contemporary fiction (specific. 'The Booker Prize') and it's horrid!  Horrid!

Viz., I concur.

This, from a student essay I've just this minute read and marked.  It's only a five-word sentence, but it happens to be one that opens onto vistas of extraordinary plenitude and wonder:  'His imagination is limitaneously unshackled.'

Bask.  Bask in that sentence, I say.

@AR: Is that Milton or Blake? Sometimes hard to tell the difference.

Too true, Karl.  We have Miltonic students, and [Blakey](http://astro.ic.ac.uk/~mortlock/remnants/2005/2007/blakey\_big.jpg) students.

I should add: I don't expect that gag to go over, transatlantically speaking.

I'll smile and nod anyhow, because we're polite over here.

Wait ... you're _American_? I'd just assumed, what with the Karl and the surname that is clearly an Anglicization of 'Stalin', that you were an old Soviet Russian.  I live and learn.
