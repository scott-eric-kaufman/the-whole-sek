## Why Some Subaltern Should Not Speak

 * Originally posted at http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/01/why_some_subalt.html

Overheard in the hall outside my office today:
**Student #1:** Then that asshole from my Asian American studies class said I didn't respect him 'cause he was Asian American.**Student #2:** But you're _half-fucking-__Vietnamese_.****

**Student #1:** You think that'd matter?  He'd start spouting shit about me being the child of like colonial imperialism American nationalism.

**Student #2:** So what'd you tell him?

**Student #1:** I didn't say nothing.  I should've said 'Look you smug fuck, you think people don't respect you 'cause you're Asian American but no one likes you because you're__an asshole.  I'm not silencing your voice or oppressing you.  I just want you to shut the fuck up about the politics of why no one listens to you when no one listens to you because you're such a fucking asshole.'  Fuck!

I can't be entirely certain, but I think this strange theoretical fluency may be peculiar to Irvine.  To overhear theoretically sophisticated undergraduates complaining about the illegitimate theoretical assumptions of another undergraduate isn't something that happens on college campuses across the country.  Or is it?

Or is my calling these students "theoretically sophisticated" a bit of an exaggeration?   It certainly is.  But they're by no means necessarily _less_ sophisticated than the ideologue whose behavior they so colorfully declaimed.  I could spin my own yarn about the deeper significance of this conversation, but it would only recapitulate the Fifty-Seventh of Scott's Distributive Characterological Population [Lemmata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemma\_%!m(MISSING)athematics%!)(MISSING): 
Number of People You Know/2 = Number of Assholes You Know

I can't say for sure, but I think you can expect that sort of theoretical fluency especially across campuses known as liberal or politically correct(I'm not using this in a pejorative sense). The students immersed in the theory are the truly fluent ones, but those who aren't as involved and disdain it still appear to know the most gimmicky aspects of the language just enough to poke fun. This latter group has usually never read more than two original 'theoretical' (which for most kids blurs into the category 'postmodern') texts, yet really get off hearing something like the Sokal Hoax.

When I was a student at Macalester, I heard that sort of thing all the time.  The occasion that immediately springs to mind is an afternoon spent playing _Perfect Dark_ at a friend's dorm room, until their Mock Trial partner showed up to prepare a case and started explaining how the game reinforced the hegemony of American imperialism (or similarly slightly nonsensical phrasing).

Isn't the obvious clue right at the start: "Then that asshole from my Asian American studies class said I didn't respect him 'cause he was Asian American"?

Sounds like the class itself is informing the argument, no?

LB, point to the obvious answer, why don't you?  I'd say one plausible explanation, as others have suggested, is that the students have learned just enough to put that guy through his paces . . . which is my way of not answering the question the way I initially wanted to, _i.e._ "Yeah, like the kids would've been paying attention or doing the reading or something."

Hm.  Might it just be possible, before you leap to taking sides against a caricature of the PC Police-Student, that this student spoken of only in clichés actually had a (more nuanced) point?  Lots of mixed-ethnic students have trouble confronting their own embeddedness in racist histories and ideology, and so jerk their knees like so, in a ready-made language with its own identity politics, to be sure.  It's possible, of course, that the spoken-of student really was an asshole, or at least relying (pedantically and lazily) on a ready-made language.  But at least he would still be a questioning asshole?  Still, that's only speculation.  All you heard was too students commiserating together (in a ready-made, anti-Theory language).

I'm not taking sides in this, only pointing out the general lack of theoretical sophistication among students at a school with a reputation for theoretical sophistication.  Maybe the joke was too sutble.  I'm _not_ calling those bumbling undergraduates theoretically sophisticated, nor am I calling the subject of their conversation theoretically unsophisticated.  I _am_ noting the general lack of theoretical sophistication in the undergraduate population at large, and pointing to both ways in which that can manifest itself: 1) the asshole so in love with the sound of his own mind that he diagnoses everyone of everything and 2) the asshole who can't tell whether the other asshole's just being an asshole or whether he has a legitimate point.  Both come under equal ridicule in the above post.  (Hence my hypothetical reply to LB: "Yeah, like the kids would've been paying attention or doing the reading or something.")  Or did you think I was siding with those two eloquent souls?

Now I've add a "necessarily" to disambiguate the point: "But they're by no means necessarily _less_ sophisticated than the ideologue whose behavior they so colorfully declaimed."  That wasn't an anti-PC or anti-Theory broadside, Matt, so much as an excuse to type the phrase "the politics of why no one listens to you" and use the word the "lemmata" in public.

Do you agree that an anti-Theory clique often functions as an identity politics in its own right?

"so much as an excuse to type the phrase "the politics of why no one listens to you" and use the word the "lemmata" in public."

Nah, it was an excuse to once again associate a certain type of energy with your office.  Clearly you are setting yourself up to pitch a screenplay for a movie in which, mysteriously, a grad student's office becomes the focus for all the getting-it-on being got on at School Today.

Yep, I could really see it -- Keanu in dark glasses playing Scott, with the argument outside and attempted sex inside the office going on at the same time with Scott standing in the opened doorway, coolly saying things about whether this is going to affect his evolutionary experiments, and the people inside and outside the office hearing each other's lines and thinking that they're talking to each other.

Must stop myself from writing a few paragraphs of this parody.... OK.

Not really, since it lacks the essentialism I associate with identity politics.  It's impossible to _be_, essentially, a constellation of ideas.  Then again, that's all a race is anyway, but since I deny identity politics philosophical coherence (but not political purpose, since I realize the benefits they've had on American politics, although, once co-opted, they also have the potential to be otherwise).  I don't think the belief that opposition to that beast I Theory--by which I mean a series of intellectual attitudes attached, though not necessarily, to an identifiable body of work--can function as an identity category.  But then again, I don't belong to the anti-Theory camp; I belong to the "I believe 'Theory-with-a-capital-t' exists" camp.

Nope.  I have a _new_ office now.  Actually, it's not mine, it belongs to a professor kind enough to let me use his office when he isn't.  (And since he's now in administration, he's never in it.)  It's actually quite nice.  It has a desk.  No boxes.  No clutter.  A fully stocked library of Theory-with-a-capital-T books (the generous man in question edited [this book](http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/8711.html)) and early and 19th century Americanist criticism.  And _no internet connection_.  I can work uninterrupted by my own baser instincts for hours on end.  Paradise.  A vacation from myself, really.

Not that that means I can't follow through with this: _Clearly you are setting yourself up to pitch a screenplay for a movie in which, mysteriously, a grad student's office becomes the focus for all the getting-it-on being got on at School Today._  If you finish that parody, I'll slap my name on it and send it off.

Yeah, I think what we've got here is your typical "undigested lecture notes" problem.  It's really bad with theory, in which, like boullion, a little goes a long way.  It's not restricted to theory, though.  I remember teaching \*Oroonoko\* and giving my students a brief historical lecture on the English Civil War.  When it was repeated back to me in their response papers, it was oddly distorted, sort of like what happens when you stick a foreign language poem into an on-line translator.  Which was really interesting, cuz the students could still often make coherent historicized arguments, even with bad history -- which led to my suspicion of historicism.  That is, given text A and history B, we can explain A via B even if we get B wrong.   

But the point is that it's always scary to hear undigested knowledge being thrown around.  It's probably scarier when the knowledge is of the "ethnic studies" variety and the "throwing around" is of the interpersonal conflict variety.

Your reference to "sophisticated" thinking gave me the heebie jeebies. What do you use for a sophisticometer? Has the needle moved much for average educated Westerner since Aristotle? What's the needle reading among culturally indigenous Amazonians? Does "sophisticated" really mean anything more than "part of the club"?

I'm with Matt, is there possibly a camp that doesn't believe cap-T Theory exists?  Isn't it one of those things where belief sort of makes it so?

Grammar fixed, Ben.  Now it should be clear that I'm building something mind-blowingly awesome.  

Kenneth and Matt, I must be missing something.  I think there is a group of people who don't believe Theory-with-a-capital-t exists.  Don't y'all belong to it?  I mean, haven't you both on occasion argued that what I call cap-T Theory you don't consider nearly so coherent?  To reiterate, I'm not anti-theoretical, nor am I even anti-Theoretical  . . . although I'm certainly anti-psychoanalytic and -psychoanalytically-informed.  But unless I'm particularly dense this afternoon, I'm not sure what you're getting at.  Are you saying cap-T Theory only exists because I think it does, and that therefore this debate, like any about the logic of speciation, depends upon fluid borders instead of essential categories, and that the coterie of characteristics I've identified with cap-T Theory isn't enough?  Because rhetorically, that's a potentially powerful argument, but it's one that can be used against any attempt to label anything: "No, it's not nearly so distinct or internally coherent as you think it is, therefore you can't consider it a single category.  You know, like dogs.  Daschunds and German Shepards."

I'm dense myself, and I've been engaged in a sustained mental attrition brought on by intense baby-care over the last 30 hours, but I personally have never understood why people believe that "hey, that's a good argument but I think it might apply to everything, so I'll simply discount it" to be a remotely compelling rejoinder.  I'm not saying that this rejoinder accurately describes what I was hinting at above, but I mean seriously, as people who spend our time thinking about the specificity of various artifacts, shouldn't we expect a bit more interest in the specificity of a given claim, specifically here the claim regarding cap-T theory, and shouldn't we also be inherently suspicious of any attempt at an elision/reduction predicated on the so-called Linneaan Blues?  Is it so difficult to say "hmm, given the political overtones of a claim to believe in/produce cap-T Theory, maybe I should pay a bit more attention to the structure and reasons that animate such a self-fulfilling prophecy, if indeed it is one, and I think the amount of attention i give this question should be greater than the effort I might expend over a concern that I might have over unfairly or imprecisely deployed the term 'dog'"?

In this particular case, yes, of course it matters that there are what you call fluid boundaries and not essential categories, but that's hardly the locus of the objection.  The distinction between the two of those ideas is specious anyway, as the two contaminate each other from the start, something with which the vast majority of readers here would no doubt agree.  The objection, if there is one in general (read: elsewhere, like at The Valve) to this practice, to this type of terminological production, it has nothing to do with the general ontological failure of a taxonomy and everything to do with the political and ideological consequences that attend the belief in the soundness of one's production of a taxonomy and the dangers that attend the belief that one is innocent of involvement in such a self-fulfilling endeavor, or the assumption that such an involvement is necessary and therefore excused from serious investigation.  So no, I'm not so much concerned with the political fallout from our canine friends being lumped together, but I am concerned about the use of race, the odd anthropology that undergirds the concept of the human, and indeed, the whole delineation of a capital T-theory.

That being said, there was no objection listed here of course, just a note that you believe it, lots of people believe it, and thus, cap-T theory exists.  Much as any other discursive concept emerges from mutually sustaining discourses that function independently of any necessary question of a referent or testable object.  Much as the Universe exists thanks to our looking at it.

And as much as I disdain much of psychoanalysis, I think there's something fundamentally compelling, perhaps heuristic, about the structure of _objet petit a_, in that it helps us to understand how, in the absence of a sense of fullness, a thing can be elevated to such a level that it can sustain a subject's position/relation even in the absence of that consummation, indeed, precisely because of the absence of that consummation.  Which may very well be what goes on in this question of cap-T Theory.  Just a random thought about cap-T Theory's "impossible relation."
