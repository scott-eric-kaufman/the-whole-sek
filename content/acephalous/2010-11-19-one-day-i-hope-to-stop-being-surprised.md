\[_The response to [this silliness](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=23020) can be found [here](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/11/how-not-to-help-your-cause.html)._\]

I try not to pay attention to Glenn Beck, but even when I have, I never really _paid attention_ to him.  But when an old friend, someone I genuinely respect, forwarded  me a link to Beck’s archive and dared me to refute his logic, I decided  it might be time to try.

_Bad decision_.

As someone who’s studied linguistics and taught journalism, I know  that spoken language differs significantly from written and resist  judging speakers for not speaking in complete sentences or organizing  their thoughts into coherent paragraphs.  That said, it should still  possess some underlying logic, which is why this transcript from his [November 19th](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,602243,00.html) program requires an airing out.  It begins by preying on lunatic fears of a One World Government:

> I have a little bug inside of me, too, and it wants to  stop control-hungry progressives from running our lives and pushing us  into a giant global system of government. You know, the kind of global  government that [Jay Rockefeller's] dad liked so much.  [David  Rockefeller] was a globalist and had a wonderful vision of the future of  our world.

Then, just in case his audience was insufficiently terrified:

> I feel a little uncomfortable. We’ll talk about preparing for—let’s just leave it at that, being prepared.

Note how, in a classic bit of demagoguery, he stops himself just  short the moment of revelation.  People fear what they don’t know,  especially when they’re being told, in ominous tones, that the unknown  requires preparation and is connected, somehow, to the “shadowy” or  “spooky” forces of the One World Government.  Those adjectives don’t  appear in that particular quotation, but they appear later, and  frequently, especially with regards to:

> George Soros, [whose] daddy was a globalist as well. He  believed in something called Esperanto. Esperanto is a made up language.  It was designed for a one world government. It started in the 1890s,  1880s. And he was fluent in it. I mean, he wrote a book in Esperanto for  one world government. Later, George Soros started his Open Society  Institute. The main goal of the Open Society Institute was really that  of his father’s: to create a world free of nationalities—one world  government.

I knew, in the vague way that everyone who follows politics knows,  that Beck believes that lines on a chalkboard have the force of logic.  I  did not, however, appreciate that he was trafficking in full-throated  conspiracy theories about the imminent invasion of the forces of the One  World Government.  Put differently, I expected to find moments, like  the following, in which Beck discovered in the world connections that  only exist in his head:

> Soros explains the anti-capitalist, pro-Marxist tactics  he uses to fundamentally transform countries. They are the dreams of his  father—which is weird because that’s almost the title of Barack Obama’s  book, _The Dreams From My Father_. His daddy, by all accounts  was a communist, at least an anti-colonialist, as was his grandfather.   The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.

I’m sure his audience didn’t realize that the connective tissue of  his argument is that Soros and Obama both had fathers with dreams.  You  know who else had a dream?  [An episode of _Dexter_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1242113/), which is about a serial killer, which means that Obama is in grave danger:

> George Soros thinks he’s on the verge of [establishing  the One World Government]. He has collapsed economies and entire  currencies. They see it as possibly—possibly—falling apart. I told you  that I believed this show may have accelerated their timetable because  we’ve exposed them. But what if—what if they really do believe that  Barack Obama is not the guy to get it done?
> 
> These guys, this is a violent, revolutionary. This guy is a labor  union with millions of dollars and, also, a globalist. This guy—spooky  dude.
> 
> This is why I told you one of my longest-standing worries about  President Obama was not about the country, not about corruption. It was  about his safety and not because of the Tea Party people, but because  the minute these radicals, if they actually decide that Barack Obama is  not who he says he is, political danger is not his only concern.
> 
> I ask you again to pray for our Secret Service. Make sure our Secret  Service are watching inside and out. Pray for our president. As I see  it, there are a million things that could happen. That’s just one of  them. There’s a million things that can make the entire world fly apart.

What, and then the Chinese will invade?

> China’s leaders know this.

_Seriously_?  Let me recount Beck’s argument for you:

> 1. Jay Rockefeller’s father supported a One World Government, which makes
> 
> 2. Glenn Beck afraid, and as you should be, because
> 
> 3. George Soros’s father wanted everyone to speak Esperanto,
> 
> 4. And had a dream, which is something Obama’s father also had, meaning
> 
> 5. If Soros is unable to fulfill his father’s dream
> 
> 6. Obama will be assassinated and
> 
> 7. China will invade.

Minus a bit about some lady finding a coat Beck’s father owned in a  Seattle pawn shop, this is the argument Beck proffered on November 19,  2010 and _it is premium-grade insane_.  I’m not talking “your  stated reasons for supporting tax cuts for the wealthy are disingenuous”  insane.  I’m talking “you couldn’t tell a premise from a conclusion if  one were labeled ‘premise’ and the other ‘conclusion’” insane.  His  disconnect from the world is either so cynical as to be sociopathic or  so fundamental as to be dissociative.

Needless to say, after reading all that and writing all this, I have one less friend on Facebook.

In what spirit was this dare made, if you're free to say?

Something like: "Beck's logic is so unassailable that I believe even someone like you, an academic, will be convinced by its explanatory power."

And honestly, I'm not about to interact with anyone who thinks _that_ has explanatory power.  I only hope it came across that I wasn't just mocking Beck, but actually following his argument, such that it is, as I would one in one of the 3,192 essays I've received today.

That's primo stuff, really.

_He believed in something called Esperanto._

Whether you believe in it or not, it exists. 

_Esperanto is a made up language._

As opposed to those organic languages which we dug out of the earth, or grew in free-range pens. Esperanto is derived from existing languages, so it's not like Klingon or Elvish or Morse Code.

_It was designed for a one world government._

It was designed to make communication easier and increase human comity. Government had nothing whatsoever to do with it. Why is he so afraid of people actually talking to each other?

And if Soros is a Marxist, then I'm a penguin.

I vote cynical, personally.

Also, Tivadar soros wrote only 2 books and they were autobiographical, nothing about world governments or anationalism.

I find it quite funny that some Americans are afraid of a "world government" when their country **is** part of the _de-facto_ world government. USA has veto power in the UN, IMF, World Bank, etc, etc, ETC.

MJ: in fairness, a lot of the same Americans are virulently anti-UN. That they see it as a shadowy and all-powerful one world government rather than an ineffectual collection of bureaucrats is what strikes me as funny.

Speaking of insane, Jeff Golstein has a 1,000,000 word essay on way Glenn Beck is right and you are wrong!  My favorite revelation over the "tyranny that is the Obama Administration" is how's it has caused formally sober, if violent, neocons to start listening (and, taking seriously) the paranoid ramblings of Beck AND Levin.  This is a guy who once read and commented real artists and thinkers and now he is defending the demagogue on the corner for throwing his poo on passersby.

weird turn of events...

Goldstein is sort of an incarnation of the "weird turn"

That post was written by dicentra.  She's the Cornell gal. I don't listen to Beck much.

But it's good to see I'm still inside your head, TimB.  I've been living there rent free for years now.  It's cute.

"But it's good to see I'm still inside your head, TimB."

I'm reading about someone's unhealthy obsession with an internet nemesis, in a comment by Jeff Goldstein on Acephalous? That's what's happening? Cool.

Thank you for taking your time dissecting Beck's mindless drivel. Maybe only a few of us can follow sequential logic of one's bizarre spiel, but I'm sure at some point people should turn around and call his BS on what it is.
