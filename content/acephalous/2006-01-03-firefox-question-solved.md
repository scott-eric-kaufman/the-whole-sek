## Firefox Question (SOLVED!)

Appropos of nothing: Last night one of my cats fell asleep on my keyboard while I had Firefox open.  Now Page Up and Page Dn refuse to work because the cursor controls everything.  For example, when I'm on a page, I can move the cursor up and down and it'll stop on each line of text and before every picture in the left column, then move to the center, then to the right.  But if I hit Page Dn the screen jumps.  I've fiddle around with Firefox for past hour trying to correct this but cannot find the setting.  Any help would be much appreciated.

UPDATE:  Solved!  Apparently my cat favors Caret browsing.  Too bad for him.

Your cat has activated something called Caret browsing, the cheeky little bugger. Toggle it on/off with F7.

Victory!  Thanks Alexander.  I'm off to read up on why on earth someone would _want_ to Caret browsing to begin with ...
