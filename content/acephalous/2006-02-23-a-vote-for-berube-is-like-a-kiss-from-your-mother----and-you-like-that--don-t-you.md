So I'm guessing I'm the only who read [_The  Verse By The Side Of The Road_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0452267625)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1)?  Or that no one here's all that old?  'Cause [these signs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma\_shave#Roadside\_billboards) are _classic_.  Where else can you find a strange mixture of shaving wisdom, admonitions not to drink and allusions to mangled corpses?

I haven't read that book Scott, but I did read "The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio" and you are right - Burma Shave signs rule.

BTW, you are my new hero.  I was so sad going to bed last night, seeing Bellamy Foster's numbers tick up like that.  fight on.
