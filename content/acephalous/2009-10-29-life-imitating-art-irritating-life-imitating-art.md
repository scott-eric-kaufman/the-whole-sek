			The premise of [_Curb Your Enthusiasm_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000E2PVR/diesekoschmar-20), according to James Kaplan's 2004 profile of Larrry David in _The New Yorker_, is that:  
David's
character is a semi-retired sitcom mogul who ambles through his
inordinately comfortable life, routinely managing to annoy or infuriate
everyone around him. This season, some of those people will include the
blind, the physically handicapped, and the mentally challenged ...
David has a sardonic, slightly depressive presence onscreen, and is
quite natural playing his worst self. Some of his finest moments are
when he gets into arguments—arguments that he always loses—with
children.In this week's episode, David accidentally
urinates on a picture of Jesus, the urine is mistaken for a tear, and
in the end, he manages to annoy and infuriate everyone around him. So
it goes ... or would have, had he not also managed to annoy and
infuriate conservatives who don't watch the show. The Anchoress [wants to know](http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/theanchoress/2009/10/28/would-he-piss-on-an-image-of-obama/):  
Would he piss on an image of Obama?Absolutely. [Next question](http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/87494/).  
Would he piss on an image of Obama?Absolutely. Crying guy, would you like [to say something](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jjmnolte/2009/10/29/pissing-on-jesus-hollywood-hates-us-exhibit-11567/)?  
Good people hurt innocent people every day.Larry David's not good people.  
Eventually, their better nature takes over.He doesn't have one.  
They think about how such a cruel and disrespectful act might hurt those they know.Are you _sure_ you're talking about Larry David here? Because I'm not. Anyone else?   
I’ve
never seen this show, does anyone know if the assistant is recognizably
ethnic? Is this “brave” comedian also taking a swipe at Hispanic (or
for that matter Italian or Irish) piety?First, when you
assume that a housekeeper's Hispanic, that makes you the racist.
Second, if you want people to respect what you say, don't tell people
that your speculation is based on unadulterated ignorance. Third, if
you think anyone other than Larry David would be the punchline of an
episode of _Curb Your Enthusiasm_, you've proven the validity of my previous sentence.   

Moreover, if you've been horrified and offended by what Larry David did _then congratulations_, he just suckered you into participating in an episode of _Curb Your Enthusiasm_. You're no longer the audience: you are, in effect, _on the show_.

Is this, in fact, what the show's been angling for all along? Free publicity and the opprobium of ijits?

I realized exactly how good Curb Your Enthusiasm was a long time ago.  Near the end of Season 1, the episode about the incest survivor group had me laughing uncontrollably despite how uncomfortable the subject naturally was.  It  reminded me of Alan Alda strutting around Crimes and Misdemeanors saying "If it bends...it's funny.  If it breaks...not funny."  By the time they got to the point at which the survivors were in group together, sharing their accounts of childhood horrors, I was thinking "This has surely nearly broken by now, but it's still working."

Only Christians would hang their deity over a toilet, easily within splatter range for a man with a medicinally-enhanced stream.  So, no, I don't think Larry David would have pissed on Our Lord Obama or any other deities, mostly for lack of opportunity.
