Only with more words. The first of which look like this:

The fifth season of "Breaking Bad" is an exercise in 
aggressive  nostalgia. "Ozymandias," lauded by many as one of the 
strongest hours in  television history ten minutes in, is especially 
committed to reminding  the audience how different the world these 
characters inhabit is. It  opens with a flashback that doubles as a 
classic "process" shot, an  extreme close-up a cook flask.

But  this is no ordinary flashback. This flashback is holding the 
narrative  hostage. The audience knows that twenty months in the future,
 on this  exact same plot of New Mexican desert, Hank Schrader and Steve
 Gomez are  slowly staining the sand red, while Walter White and Jesse 
Pinkman are  bound, locked and helpless in the backseats of the DEA 
agent's vehicles.  Something shattering is about to happen...
