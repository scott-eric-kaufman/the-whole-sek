Everyone is allowed one Frivolous Interest.  [This is mine](http://www.metsgeek.com/articles/2007/05/28/ramblings-of-a-lone-met-fan/).  
There's no way to link to everything I'll post there, but if you're really interested in what I have to say about this decidedly unacademic topic, I can post a link every once in a while.
   If you're interested, you can read what I think about _béisbol_ [here](http://www.metsgeek.com/?author=45&cat=16).

Or, alternately, Hawthorne!

Hey, Mostly Harmless's baseball-to-golf batting average is below the Mendoza line, so if you can stand associating with a Giants fan (not me--I'm ex-Yankees and ex-Mets and now just ex-baseball), feel free to cross-post your Metsgeekery with us.

When I glanced at the link, I saw that you mentioned Kos-style diaries, but isn't the site itself actually a Markos Moulitsas Zuniga project?  He once said that he was working on a network of diary/blog sites, one for each sports team.

I'm fairly certain you're pulling my leg, but if you aren't, I don't think the site is a Kos project.  It started as a place for the more saber-friendly Mets fans to congregate, and grew from there.

I do, however, need to come up with a better handle over there.  It was on the back-burners all weekend, but I came up with nothing.

I wasn't pulling your leg, but I was actually wrong.  A quick Google reveals that the actual Kos Mets sportsblog is [here](http://www.amazinavenue.com/).

Well, that site's related to Mets Geek, as one of its writers runs it ... wait, does that mean I'm part of Kos's empire now?  Is this when the cash starts rollin' in?  (I hope so.  I like money.)
