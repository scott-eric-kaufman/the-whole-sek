## Meaningful Synchronicity or Mere Coincidence?

In addition to those other [coincidences](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/paging\_dr\_freud.html#more), when I sat down to eat lunch, I read [this](http://www.metafilter.com/62116/CrossPromotional-Bloggy-Goodness), which takes me [here](http://pourout.wordpress.com/), which [links](http://pourout.wordpress.com/2007/06/14/bbc-billboards-brilliant/) to [here](http://brittney.typepad.com/sparkwood\_21/2007/06/bbc\_nyc\_billboa.html), which started [this](http://brittney.typepad.com/sparkwood\_21/2007/06/am\_i\_dreaming\_i.html), which ended here.  (You [may remember](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/refined\_white\_s.html).)  

As in _here_.  No link required.  Did I mention the title of [this](http://brittney.typepad.com/sparkwood\_21/2007/06/am\_i\_dreaming\_i.html) applies to the events of the past week and the coincidences of the past hour?  

If you're reading this, I have evidence that the answers to those questions are "No" and "Yes" respectively.  If you're not, I'm almost certain the answers are reversed.

These coincidences are not on the order of, say, finding out you [live in the very same house as the characters in the novel you're reading](http://theresalduncan.typepad.com/witostaircase/2007/05/a\_mind\_blowing\_.html).  _That_ would turn me into a Jungian.
