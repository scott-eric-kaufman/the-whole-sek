## The Bounds of My Shame Knows No Bounds

[The Little Professor](http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the\_little\_professor/2005/03/shame.html#comments) and the good people over at the [Refuge for the Literate](http://timpeoples.blogspot.com/) have disclosed their horrifying intellectual inadequacies.  I refuse to be bested so lightly, so I present to you some books A. Cephalous has never read:

*   Hawthorne's [_The Marble Faun_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140390774/qid=1111861623/sr=1-2/ref=sr\_1\_2/103-8289502-8607027?v=glance&s=books): One of the few books I abandoned while in the middle of the penultimate chapter.  I trudged through 454 pages and emerged with first-degree purplings over 91%!o(MISSING)f my body: "You have an advantage over me!  I am no true creature of the woods; while you are a real Faun, I do believe.  When your curls shook, just now, methought I had a peep at the pointed ears!"  However, having read Megan Marshall's article on Hawthorne's treatment of Elizabeth Peabody in this week's _New Yorker_, I'm more than willing to hike the well-manicured gently gradient path to the moral high ground occupied by Cornell West, John Carlos Rowe, Eric Cheyfitz, etc. and declare my disapproval of Hawthorne's behavior reason enough to avoid reading anything he wrote ever again. *   Frank Harris' [_The Bomb_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0922915377/qid=1111862677/sr=1-2/ref=sr\_1\_2/103-8289502-8607027?v=glance&s=books): Atop the stack of books I must read on pain of painful death stares Harris' fictional account of the Haymarket riots.  Necessary to my dissertation?  Certainly.  Riddled with so many egregious typographical errors as to make some of my students' hasty "efforts" look carefully edited ?  Absolutely.
*   Tom Wolfe's [_The Right Stuff_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553381350/qid=1111863798/sr=8-2/ref=pd\_csp\_2/103-8289502-8607027?v=glance&s=books&n=507846):  I teach literary journalism.  I teach the research skills necessary to write the interior monologues for which Wolfe is so famous.  But I haven't read anything he's written since 1979 except _The Bonfire of the Vanities_ and a couple of chapters of _I am Charlotte Simmons_.  Am I a fraud?  Because I feel like a fraud...

I'm stopping here.  Any further and those gnawing doubts would feast on my insecurities...before asking the waiter to doggy-bag what's left.

I can totally beat that. Bear in mind that I am a medievalist:

1) \*The Canterbury Tales\*: I skipped the Parson and one half of the Squire. An uncharitable observer might suggest that I did not, in point of fact, "finish" the work.

2) \*The Divine Comedy\*: Got bored after "Inferno" section.

3) \*Piers Plowman\*: Really tried on this one, since I gave a paper on it at the largest medievalist conference in the world. But, you know, it's just so long.

Beat that.

I can't top that.  Medievalists who focus on works written in English only have four works to study; you're confessing to only having finished two of them.  Responsible Americanists--i.e. ones who read more than Foucault/Derrida/Butler/etc. and a handful of politically palatable primary sources--have thousands of novels, hundreds of thousands of magazines, and hundreds of hundreds of thousands of newspapers to sift through before we can write anything.  Little wonder you've banged out a dissertation chapter in a little less than a week whereas Some Canadian Guy and I have labored on ours for a little over a decade...

There you go again, A. Cephalous, pointing the finger at everything and everyone except my genius.

And, anyway, why are you criticizing me when you should be reading \*The Marble Faun\*? I mean, really, who hasn't?
