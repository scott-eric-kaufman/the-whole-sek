This election cycle [fractionates my life simply](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679748261/diesekoschmar-20): things are either good-for-the-Obama or no-good-for-the-Obama.  

The [news](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/10/nyregion/10cnd-spitzer.html) of Eliot Spitzer's involvement with a prostitution ring?  Not-so-bad-for-the-Obama, but not-so-good-for-the-Obama either.

I can sympathize. This primary has dominated my attention these last few weeks to my detriment.

I'd pronounce this bad-for-Obama. He needed to regain media attention and today had a barbed response to the "CIC threshold" crap and the Obama-as-veep desperation from Clinton's camp. This could have been widely spread footage of him mocking their weak-ass attempts to slow him up.

Now Spitzer dominates for a news cycle or two while Mississippi hands another chunk of delegates to the party's actual front-runner.

Actually, I think you're right: this does fall squarely in the no-good-for-the-Obama category.  He'll still win handily in MS, but he won't receive any bounce from it or the CIC talkback.  

Damn you, Spitzer.

Nooo! Not my boy Spitzer! I followed his stint as Attorney General with such excitement because he really went after Wall Street and white-collar crime during the whole Enron-WorldCom-give-the-store-away debacles, so to see him trip himself up in this stupid way is just crushing. 

On the other hand, I can't believe you didn't highlight _this_ part of the article: they got him on the motherfucking Mann Act! Yes, the 1910 anti "white slavery" law not allowing women to be transported across state lines for immoral purposes is _still_ on the fucking books! Wow. 

I'm sure this ties into Wharton and Twain somehow but I don't know if they ever wrote explicitly on white slavery.

Enough hysteria about the "outdated" Mann Act.  It has been amended since its Taftian days, and now reads that it is a federal crime to transport people across state lines to perform any sexual act that is itself already illegal.  Sounds like a fairly sane law to me.

Prostitution should itself be legal, regulated, and taxed (and embarrassing: I mean, sex is simply never so good that one should pay for it).  But the Mann Act is not the problem.
