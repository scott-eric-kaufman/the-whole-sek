Despite having sidestepped into specializing in rhetoric of [the](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/watchmen/) [visual](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/comics/) [ilk](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/the-dark-knight/), I'm a profoundly nonvisual thinker—meaning I work best when surrounded by sloppily piled, [outrageously annotated](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/03/271-twohundred-and-seventyone-notes-from-a-novel-i-dont-remember-reading.html) books—so when I see someone I'm married to organize her thoughts into maps of obscene complexity, I'm baffled as to how they might be useful to her.  For example:

[![Lunatic](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5b91e68970c-500pi "Lunatic")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/V%!T(MISSING)he%!D(MISSING)ionysian%!I(MISSING)magination.pdf) 

Were I to try to write alongside that, I simply wouldn't.  There'd be much in the way of wide-eyed staring and incipient panic, but as for words and prose, the former'd only be mangled into the latter with great violence.

I'm really spatially-oriented, so I do something very similar, except not all neat and color-coded. My pre-draft materials consist of 80 million thoughts or notes to myself, each printed out on a piece of paper and spread out in front of me like this, when I'm sitting in my living room.

Obviously a frisky cat can wreak havoc on my system. Maybe I should switch over to this one.

That chart is so close to genius as to make no odds.

Also there's a part of me feels that 'loony' is not necessarily or entirely advisable intra-marriage vocabulary.

It's not a visual thing, so much as a need to have _some_ coherence to the material, especially comparative material. I have a penchant for rearranging chapters of textbooks into charts, to make sense of them. Then I use those charts as handouts, though what I really should be doing is forcing my students to make their own: it's much more illuminating to create than to read.

It can't be _that_ complicated -- it's [planar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar\_graph)!

(Actually, this might be a sort-of-interesting question: how many people, when they map out their thoughts on a certain subject in a graph like this, actually end up drawing planar graphs?)

One of my committee members works this way, so I know that it can be done in history.  But, much as I admire the Little Womedievalist's organization, I also know that I'm not capable of working that way.  Those just don't look like paragraphs to me.

Sisyphus:

_Obviously a frisky cat can wreak havoc on my system._

You should've seen the frisky kitty mess made that inspired her to go digital.  It had been a cork board masterpiece, but three seconds of cat-rassling did it (and nearly her chapter) in.

Adam:

_That chart is so close to genius as to make no odds._

No, no, she's plenty odd . . . but I don't think "make no odds" means in American what it does in whatever you people speak.

Ahistoricality:

_It's not a visual thing, so much as a need to have some coherence to the material, especially comparative material._

No, it's a visual thing for her: when she explains things to me, she points here and there in a way that befuddles me.  There's a sense to it, but it's not a sense I can easily follow, being slow and stupid as I am.

Arthegall:

Great to hear from you!  That said:

_It can't be that complicated -- it's planar!_

You're just trying to make me look bad, aren't you?  Because I can't understand it and _it's planar_!  And you linked to a site that involves maths I can't fathom from, but which I'm sure make much in the way of sense to thems with sense enough to fathom them.

JPool:

_Those just don't look like paragraphs to me._

Me neither.  And yet, she writes.  (Thinks quite a bit better than me, too.)

Josef:

_What was used to draw that chart, if I may ask?_

It's called [Visual Understanding Environment](http://vue.tufts.edu/), and the wife loves it to pieces.

I need to plan with big sprawling idea maps, too.  Anything interesting is going to have a complex net of relationships.

Alas, I am too weak of brain to go directly to writing.  I have to chunk out the sprawl into some sort of linear path first.

This is a great technique for teaching, one that I'm trying to incorporate more (for I, too, am not a visual-spatial learner).

Joseph Novak, who is a brilliant specialist in science education, pioneered the use of concept maps in teaching science.  His research began by asking MIT grads to draw concept maps of the relationships between basic concepts in physics.  What he learned was that the grads could do the math, solve the problems, but they had all sorts of messed up ideas about the concepts and their relationships.  Further research determined that one way to help a student who reaches an impasse is to have him/her compose a concept map and look for the faulty thinking.  Once the student sees where the thinking has gone sour, it's easier to undo that bad learning and rewire the conceptual network.  

(One key difference between the concept map and yr wife's map is that concept maps force students to write, along the lines connecting the chunks, what exactly the relationship between the chunks is.)

Novak also has freeware for concept mapping, along with a site where students can add their concept maps to others' maps from all around the world -- ultimately making a giant map of all the concepts out there.

I never got concept mapping.  I've known a lot of people who really liked them, and I've had them as assignments in educational type situations, but my brain doesn't work that way.  

I had a lot of trouble diving things up into little bubbles because I'd end up wanting to slice things up differently depending on the angle from which I was approaching my subject.  

Then two dimensions seemed constraining, the interconnections were too dense.  I spent more time thinking about how to spatially organize the map than thinking about the concepts involved.  Eventually I  gave up trying to make things neat and just decided to arrange all the noun type things in a circle and then draw the interconnections between them, which allowed me to connect everything I wanted to without random connections between far away pieces, but looking at it, I realized it was possibly the least useful representation of the structure of my subject area possible.

Luther Blissett:  

_"One key difference between the concept map and yr wife's map is that concept maps force students to write, along the lines connecting the chunks, what exactly the relationship between the chunks is."_

This is an excellent point, and one I hadn't actually considered before now. I've found that maps of this sort help me to break down, understand and retain arguments in a way that I just couldn't before. However, I'm still looking for a better way to use them in my writing. The idea of forcing myself to spell out the connections between key points, or even of using a map to work through an impasse in my own argument, is one of the best suggestions I've read to date. (Writer's block is a constant source of frustration...) Thanks!

Hofstadter has a much bigger and more complicated diagram in one of his books, but I'm not sure if he intended to use it as anything more than an explanation of how the mind deals with interrelated concepts.

And in response to Arthegall, Hofstadter's map is very, very non-planar (albeit drawn in two dimensions).

To actually have some kind of example of how your wife thinks is a gift.  Granted how I just typed that makes it sound like I'm doing the stereotypical wife bashing jokes, but I mean it as a truly wonderful thing.  This is a great opportunity to learn more about that special person in your life.

On a sidenote, a comment further up the line mentioned that your wife's graph is in planes.  As I 'suffer' from synesthesia, i must safe that thinking in planes provokes some ideas and questions.  I sometimes think of graphs and charts in terms of taking up space.  Maybe your wife thinks the same way by the size variations  and color separations that she has on the chart (though it is simple and safe to say that they are just there to encapsulate the text and make it easier to find versus wasting time to make it appear receding in space).  At minimum you could find out if she associates color with text.
