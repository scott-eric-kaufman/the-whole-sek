(_x-posted to [the Valve](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/observations\_on\_the\_latest\_modern\_fiction\_studies/)_ )

The [Winter 2006](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern\_fiction\_studies/toc/mfs52.4.html) number of _Modern Fiction Studies_
hit the streets this morning.  This issue is special, devoted to what
it calls “graphic narrative,” but which everyone I know calls “funny
books.” _De gustibus_, yes, but accompanied by a strong impulse to legitimize the objects they’re studying.  After all, this is _MFS_, not [_The Journal of Popular Culture_](http://www.msu.edu/%!E(MISSING)tjpc/).  For the sake of reference, the [previous special issue](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern\_fiction\_studies/toc/mfs52.2.html) (Summer 2006) was devoted to Toni Morrison, not exactly a marginal figure in contemporary literature.  Reading the [introduction](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern\_fiction\_studies/v052/52.4chute01.html) and first three essays, I sense that the audience of this issue is _MFS_ readers, not scholars of the works in question.

More evidence: Art Spiegelman’s [_Maus_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679748407/diesekoschmar-20) rests the on the tip of everyone’s tongues.  Not that _Maus_ isn’t brilliant—although, what with my interest in [race and essentialism](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/academic\_advoca.html) in contemporary literary studies and _fin de siècle_
evolutionary theory, I find elements of it highly problematic—only that
scholars have been embracing it for the better part of two decades.  [Project Muse](http://muse.jhu.edu/) alone pulls up 261 references to it, many of which with serious, scholarly titles like Erin Heather McGlothlin’s “[No Time Like the Present: Narrative and Time in Art Spiegelman’s _Maus_](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/narrative/v011/11.2mcglothlin.html)” and Victoria A. Elmwood’s “[‘Happy, Happy, Ever After’: The Transformation of Trauma between the Generations in Art Spiegelman’s _Maus: A Survivor’s Tale_](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/biography/v027/27.4elmwood.html).”  Being the subject of articles in _Narrative_ and _Biography_
indicates a work has acquired canonical cachet—so much, in fact, that
its mention lends prestige to the lowly genre to which it belongs. 
Hillary Chute and Marianne DeKoven, the editors of this issue, say as
much:

The project of this special issue is to bring the medium of comics—its conventions, its violation of its own conventions, _what it does differently_—to
the forefront of conversations about the political, aesthetic, and
ethical work of narrative. For many of us interested in graphic
narrative, without any clear-cut methodology established for
considering contemporary comics texts as multilayered narrative works
(aside from debates within the field of postmodern fiction and
postmodernism generally), and, until recently, without a range of
examples to sit next to _Maus_ on our bookshelves, _Maus_ itself set the terms for ways to talk about what comics could do. It continues to set the terms, as a great, lasting work.

While I endorse all Chute and DeKoven say here, I’m a little
perplexed by the notion that “until recently, without a range of
examples to sit next to _Maus_ on our bookshelves.”  _Cerebus_—about which I’ll say more in a minute—hit its stride thirty years ago with [_High Society_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0919359078/diesekoschmar-20), [_Church and State_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0919359094/diesekoschmar-20) and [_Jaka’s Story_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0919359124/diesekoschmar-20); Neil Gaiman started publishing [_The Sandman_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563890119/diesekoschmar-20) in 1988; the first volume of _Maus_ appeared in 1986.  All of which is only to say, if someone couldn’t find _something_ to put on their shelves alongside _Maus_, they must not have been looking.  And before anyone complains this is my inner enthusiast speaking, let me state plainly:

It isn’t.  It’s my inner _historicist_—who is, admittedly, no
less petulant—compelling me to defend the genre.  Spiegelman may have
been key to its acceptance in academic circles, but he sits at the end
of a long tradition; one which, as long traditions will, contains a
robust culture of immanent critique.  To return to Dave Sim’s _Cerebus_: it began as a parody of works like _Conan_, _Red Sonja_ and [_Prince Valiant_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince\_Valiant), but eventually became a 6,000 page novel about conflicts between political and religious authorities, abuses of power and [the feminist-homosexualist axis](http://www.cerebusfangirl.com/artists/tangent2.php).  The open [embrace of misogyny](http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22954)
is certainly unfortunate, but it points to one aspect of funny books
the focus on “graphic narratives” or “graphic novels” ignores—being
produced monthly, they capture the development of a person’s thought in
a way other, more novelistic genres cannot.  The Dave Sim who in 1995 [wrote](http://www.theabsolute.net/misogyny/sim.html#texts)
“Male Light does not Merge ... Thinking, Reason, is best served by
solitude, isolation” is not the same man who appropriated Oscar Wilde’s
voice to tell the story of a young woman coming to terms with her life
in _Jaka’s Story_.

Or maybe he is.  It’s arguable.  However, the inability to revise
work once it’s been published—to smooth over stylistic infelicities, to
correct errors of fact or judgment—means that what comic artists
produce is a record of thought unlike the one produced by novelists. 
Intellectual and artistic development can be tracked, month by month,
in a way only available to students of the novel after their teachers
have died.  All of which is only to say that the focus on “graphic
narratives” fails to address this particular historicist’s pet
concerns.  Which is fine.  In the coming days, I’ll address the
articles individually.  Maybe it’s because this is the first time since
I renounced my Joycean heritage that I’ve read _every single primary text_ discussed in an article, but for some reason, I feel eminently qualified to analyze this issue of _MFS_.

So, more like blogs, then?

I think the comparison is a fascinating one to pursue.  Novels can offer a deep stare into an author's (and/or a culture's) psyche, but they're much closer to a single snapshot.  In this analogy, comics and blogs both have aspects more akin to video recordings than to still photographs--it seems to me that authorial or cultural progress, or at least change, can be brought to the fore much more readily in "ephemeral" works rather than in novels.  So while any conventional comic comprised of several dozen panels is not likely to be of comparable intellectual heft to works like, say, On the Origin of Species, the meta-narrative of real-life development can certainly make for interesting study too.

I'd agree, but then [Kotsko](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog) would accuse me of triumphalism.  (Not that you're wrong, though.)
