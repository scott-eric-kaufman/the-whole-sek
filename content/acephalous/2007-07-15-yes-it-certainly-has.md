From Herbert Spencer Jenning's "Reactions of Infusoria to Chemicals: A Criticism," _The American Naturalist_, v. 34, no. 400 (Apr., 1900):

Consider an organism, as in the figure, lying obliquely to the line of action ... indicated by the four straight arrows.  Its position is at first _a_—_a_.  After the stimulus has acted for a time, the organism is found to be oriented as shown at _b_—_b_.  The animal has certainly moved.
