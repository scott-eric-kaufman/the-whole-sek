HILARIOUS!

Next you should do the an artsy auteur John Cassavetes version, or better yet, a bleakly incomprehensible Lars Von Trier version.  Ooh, Terence Malick!

You know, Gary Glitter, he of Hey! fame, and pedophile infamy, has since relocated to Vietnam...where he has kept up his hobbies. He just settled with (bought out) two Vietnamese families to the tune of $2500 each. I don't know which is sadder, the devaluation of the Vietnamese dong or the low price of paying off pedophilia. I hated Gary Glitter before, but now it just feels like a "I join my people in protest" thing.

Anyway, no point to the above anecdote. but now John Hughes Scott Eric Kaufman can feel grossed out and dirty as the soundtrack to his day plays in the background.

Are you sure \*Charlie\* Kaufman wasn't involved in that somehow?

completely unauthentic....  after the afternoon nap, cats must again jump on male stomach... or have made the nap uncomfortable by sleeping on the legs or head.

R&R.

I hate myself for saying: it's "There is a Light That Never Goes Out."  I know people who own pieces of Morrisey's clothing, like pieces of the True Cross.  Just saying.

What can I say?  I'm a product of the CD age.  I listened to CDs in my car (when I had a car which worked and a CD player installed in it . . . so I mean 1999 or so) and pay more attention to the lyrics than the song titles (many of which I don't even know).  However, I will say that the lyric to that song specifies "[there is a light and it never goes out](http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:jAatZ3lmVlUJ:www.lyricsfreak.com/s/smiths,-the/126868.html+%!t(MISSING)here+is+a+light+that+never+goes+out%!&(MISSING)hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=2&client=firefox-a)" emenates from his holiness's lips, which means I'm wrong . . . but in an understandable and not crazy in a  Morrissey's-sweaty-t-shirt-is-my-Shroud-of-Turin kind of way.

I know better than to cross Morrissey fans . . . esp. in Southern California, where they tend to be uber-masculine Mexicans.  (I'm not kidding, either.  I've seen, and to be frank, been very impressed by, [The Sweet and Tender Hooligans](http://www.believermag.com/exclusives/?read=article\_veltman).)
