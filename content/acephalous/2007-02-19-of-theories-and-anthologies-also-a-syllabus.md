A brief conversation with Jeffrey Williams and Vincent Leitch at the MLA haunts all [my talk](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/02/in\_which\_i\_shar.html) of theories and anthologies:

**Williams:** These are things people don’t think about when putting together anthologies.

**Leitch:** Which De Man would you include?  And why?

**Me:** Something from [_Blindness and Insight_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0816611351/diesekoschmar-20), probably.

**Leitch:** But which one?  And why?

**Me:** (_stares dumbly_)

As I said, a brief conversation.  One reason I didn’t answer Leitch’s
question is that I couldn’t—I have a terrible memory for essay titles
and didn’t want to say, “You know, the one in which he argues X, Y and
Z,” only to be informed that I was actually thinking of the “Preface”
to [_Allegories of Reading_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0816611351/diesekoschmar-20). 
The other was that I couldn’t (and can’t) divorce the question of what
to include in an anthology from its implicit pedagogical concerns: _What would I teach, and why?_  

I labor over my syllabus, often spending weeks reading and re-reading
material, justifying the inclusion of this text and the exclusion of
that one; then reversing course, concocting an equally compelling
counter-justification for excluding the former and including the
latter; then re-reversing, re-re-reversing, &c.  To be honest, I _still_ don’t know which De Man I’d include in _The Norton_
(although I have many impressively credentialed candidates); but I’m
determined to come up with some sort of answer, as I want to create a
portfolio of sample syllabi.  So when I stumbled upon Williams’ “[Packaging Theory](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0010-0994%!(NOVERB)
