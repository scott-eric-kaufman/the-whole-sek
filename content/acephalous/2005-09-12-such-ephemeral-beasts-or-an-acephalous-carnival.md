Blogs are such ephemeral beasts.  [![Lewisenemy](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/lewisenemy.jpg "Lewisenemy")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/lewisenemy.jpg)Posts are here one day, archived the next.  The conversation about the relation of the [little magazine](http://crookedtimber.org/2005/09/11/true-believers/) [to blogs](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the\_functioning\_little\_magazines/) has me thinking about how to change this unfortunate situation.  Because it needs to be changed.  Sometimes posts are written hurriedly.  I can concoct [a faux CFP](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/03/cfp\_transgender.html), for example, in less than ten minutes.  A response to [Amazon reviews of _Deadwood_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/04/quality\_and\_inc.html) can be had in a little under thirty.  But it takes significantly longer to work through [my feelings about the evidentiary standards of literary journalism](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/04/speculation\_and.html).  In said entry I discuss the questions raised by David Dobbs' excellent _Reef Madness_.  Despite the post being more than three months old, I still think about these issues daily and still believe the questions I asked then to be important now.  How can I call attention to these issues without regularly rewriting slightly different variations of the same post?  

Easy!  By linking to them!  So from now on, in addition to the production of new material for the blog I'll also be recycling old.  Some of you may not have read Acephalous when I wrote them.  Some of you may have read the recycled post and thought about commenting but never got around to it.  Now you can!  And you don't even have to search through the archives.  But WAIT!  THERE'S MORE!  If you click on the linked posts you may even find UPDATES included at no extra eye-strain!  That's right!  Silent editorial decisions will occur!  ACTUAL REVISION!  Other blogs may promise cleaner prose and more cogent arguments, [![Mustache](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/mustache.jpg "Mustache")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/mustache.jpg)but only Acephalous__guarantees that the posts you read will be leaner in style and meaner in argument after ONE application of our **REVOLUTIONARY** **NEW REVISIONARY AGENT**.  (His name's Stan.  He has an _awesome_ mustache.  For an additional $2.99 Stan will juggle your apples, oranges or ANY OTHER SPHERICAL FRUIT OR VEGETABLE.  Sure, you _could_ pay a "professional" "clown" to juggle your spherical staples, but that could cost untold thousands of dollars.  Stan juggles for _less than minimum wage_.)  Act now!  Or tomorrow!  Supplies are unlimited!
