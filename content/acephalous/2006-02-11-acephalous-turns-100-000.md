Congratulations!

When I reach 500, I'll invite you to my party.  

I wonder how many can be attributed to the "My Morning" post?

Sadly, about 1/3 of my daily traffic can _still_ be attributed to that post.  Google searches for "[office sex](http://www.google.com/search?q=office+sex&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official)" and countless variations thereof . . . plus the initial push.  But I've also hosted the history carnival (which Instapundit plugs), and have been linked to by a lot of other, more heavily trafficked blogs (including the Valve, which, I suppose, doesn't count).

I neglected to mention that the more you've written, and the more variable your subject matter, the more likely you are to get an increased number of hits from Google like "[lineage march zombies location](http://www.google.com/search?q=lineage+marsh+zombies+location&hl=en&lr=&start=10&sa=N)."  I honestly have no idea what that person was looking for, but I hope they found it.
