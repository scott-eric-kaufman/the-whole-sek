After a series of answers in which Speaker Boehner distances himself from Michele  Bachmann’s paranoid concerns about the infiltration of our government by  agents of the Muslim Brotherhood, [this exchange occurs](http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2012/07/19/548671/boehner-blasts-bachmann-says-her-unfounded-accusations-are-pretty-dangerous/):

**Q:** Would you consider taking her off the Intelligence Committee? Congresswoman Bachmann?

**JOHN BOEHNER:** I don’t know that that’s related at all.

Nor do I. It’s not like the Intelligence Committee is [tasked to oversee](http://intelligence.house.gov/about/history-jurisdiction) “the intelligence and intelligence-related activities of 17 elements of  the US Government, and the Military Intelligence Program.” It’s not as  if a person on said committee sending a letter full of undocumented  slanders and strange accusations of cultural capitulation has anything  to do with intelligence — either in its governmental or colloquial  sense. It’s not like the letter to Inspector General Charles McCullough  contains material lifted from [the splash page of this website](http://muslimbrotherhoodinamerica.com) or anything. It’s not as if the letter to Acting Inspector General  Lynne Halbrooks demonstrates a “serious concern” about how the  government labels things. Except the Halbrooks letter demands an  investigation into:

The failure of the Army in the aftermath of the Fort Hood  massacre to characterize the jihadist motivations of the alleged  shooter, a self-declared “Soldier of Allah” Major Nidal Hassan. This was  compounded by the after-action investigation which did not even  describe the incident as an example of “violent extremism” — the  government’s approved euphemism for obscuring jihadism.

The use of euphemisms, this letter contends, “may even pose security  risks for this nation, its people, and interests.” This makes perfect  sense: if I say nothing when they come for my language, I won’t be able  to complain when they impose shariah law _because they already took my language_. Policing language is very important to the authors of these letters, as evidenced by a demand for a

corrective action, consistent with the Constitution and  laws of the United States , to ensure that no Muslim Brotherhood  associated entity or individual is placed in a position of honor or  trust within the programs and operations of the Department of Defense  unless he or she has publicly condemned and disclaimed previously stated  goals of the Muslim Brotherhood.

They must “publicly condemn.” They want to make some unnamed (and all  future) people prove they’ve uprooted some thoughts from their heads. _In words_.  (Presumably before the Brotherhood takes them away.) Failure to do so  might “unnecessarily expose U.S. personnel [in Afghanistan] to hostile  action and diseases.” They must be made to say the words, or Our Troops  might _catch diseases_. The vector of these hypothetical diseases? Doesn’t matter. It _could_ happen.

If none of this makes much sense to you, consider it a compliment,  because none of these letters make sense. The boilerplate questions that  conclude all of them can be summed up thus:

1.  Is anyone under you a Secret Muslim, and if so, has he or she publicly renounced their commitment to “civilization jihad”?
2.  What is the current relationship of your Secret Muslims to the Muslim Brotherhood?
3.  Have you taken the “corrective action” described above against your Secret Muslims yet?

Follow the logic! Some Representatives are asking various Inspector Generals _to root out the Muslim spies in their respective organizations_,  but this activity is “unrelated” to the House Intelligence Committee,  because it’s only about a secret plot to destroy the United States by  “civilization jihad.” Would Speaker Boehner have us believe that spying  is “unrelated” to intelligence?

Apparently so.
