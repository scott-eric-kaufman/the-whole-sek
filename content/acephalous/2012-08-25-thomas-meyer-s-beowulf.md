Via [Eileen Joy](http://www.inthemedievalmiddle.com/2012/08/thomas-meyers-beowulf-arrives-also.html) and the outstanding number of medievalists I know on Facebook, I see that [Thomas Meyer](http://naturespoetry.blogspot.com/2008/09/wordplay-welcomes-thomas-meyer.html)'s translation of _Beowulf_ is now available. [_For free_](http://punctumbooks.com/titles/thomas-meyer-beowulf/). It possesses a striking cover:

[![Beowulf-Cover\_Meyer](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3178edc4970b-320wi "Beowulf-Cover\_Meyer")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3178edc4970b-popup)  
And though I haven't had a chance to read it yet—this translation, I mean, because I've obviously read _Beowulf_ before—the excerpt from the publisher accords neatly with my recent obsession on the [relation](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/08/realism-and-bad-manners-in-breaking-bad) of [form](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/07/walking-and-talking-with-louie-and-liz) to [content](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/07/initial-verdict-on-the-dark-knight-rises) in film:

The eyes of Hygelac’s kin watched the wicked raider  

execute his quick attack:  

without delay,  

snatching his first chance,  

a sleeping warrior,  

he tore him in two,  

chomped muscle, sucked veins’  

gushing blood,  

gulped down his morsel, the dead man,  

chunk by chunk,  

hands, feet & all.

never before had  

sinherd feared anything so.

As the publisher notes, "the reader is confronted with the words themselves running together, as 
if in panic, in much the same way that the original passage seems in 
such a rush to tell the story of the battle that bodies become confused." This is a readerly experimental mode, in which the formal experimentation is meant to assist the reader in understanding the content of the poem by replicating the experience being described. The fact that that it's not easy to parse that second stanza is the point. (I've read it about twenty times now I still keep seeing the word "dreach," if only because it sounds like a word that belongs in _Beowulf_.) Point being, there are far worse ways to spend your Saturday night than reading a poem in which "hot gore pour[s] upon whirlpools." 

Or with supporting an endeavor which, to quote Eileen,  

Every book we make, we will give away for free in electronic form, 
because we believe in the richest possible artistic-intellectual 
para-university commons in which everyone has access to whatever they 
need and want, whenever they need and want it, and so that authors can 
have the widest possible readership. But we also believe in the printed 
book: as work of art, as a stylish object for one’s cabinet of 
curiosities, as a material comfort [or bracing cocktail] to hold in 
one’s hands, as something that takes up weight and space in the world 
and adds something of beauty to the thoughts, images, and narratives we 
hold in common.
