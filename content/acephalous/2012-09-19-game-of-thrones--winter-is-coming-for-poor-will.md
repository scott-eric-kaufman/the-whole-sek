(_I think it goes without saying that this is another one of [those visual rhetoric posts](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/02/scott-eric-kaufmans-visual-rhetoric-compendium-as-of-11282011.html)._)

As this is to be the first of many posts breaking down the visual rhetoric of _Game of Thrones_, I want to tell you either "You're welcome!" or "I'm sorry!" I need to write them for [my class this quarter](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/08/new-syllabus-game-of-thrones-bold-plan-or-blasphemy.html) so they will written. Regular blogging will continue as usual. ([See](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/irony-joins-parody-on-the-body-pile)?) Now on to "[Winter Is Coming](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007HJ84ZK/diesekoschmar-20)."

For those of you who haven't read George R.R. Martin's [_Games of Thrones_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553386794/diesekoschmar-20), it's important to note that there are [twenty-four characters](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/POV\_Character) through whose perspective the narrative is occasionally focalized, meaning that the writers and directors of [the television series](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008CLI3TE/diesekoschmar-20) needed to [go full-_Rashomon_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CXC6/diesekoschmar-20) or find another way to imbue each episode with the feel of perspectival diversity. Which makes the decision to open "Winter Is Coming" with the Prologue odd but instructive. On the one hand, beginning where the novel begins is a simple decision: Martin placed the Prologue where he did because he wanted to set the mood for the scenes to come and director Tim Van Patten followed suit. On the other hand, in an episode that can only be 52 minutes long and in which numerous perspectives must be introduced, devoting 11 minutes to the quick end of the short life of Will, the Prologue's narrator, seems excessive. I'm going to argue otherwise: what the material contained in the Prologue provides the audience is a means of sympathizing with the different perspectives on Will's life and death, and in so doing begins to recreate the structure of the novel. But I'm getting ahead of myself here. First we need to be introduced to Will:

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00002](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fd593f970b-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00002")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fd593f970b-popup)  
He's one of those little black dots on horseback in this [extreme long](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48035) or [establishing shot](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#51530), the purpose of which is establish the scale of the wall by providing us with an identifiable reference and the state of the environment by showing us an unimaginably large wall made of ice and a cover of snow that follows the wall to the vanishing point. Before we even meet Will, then, Van Patten informs us that he is a small man beholden to powers great enough to build and maintain that wall, and that he is likely in peril, because no one who isn't builds and lives behind a wall like that. Moreover, the contrast between the blue-white snow and the black riders suggests that not only is Will in peril, he's conspicuously so, which means he's all the more likely to meet a sad end. And Van Patten's communicated all of this _in a single shot_. 

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00003](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2bd399970c-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00003")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2bd399970c-popup)  
He cuts to another establishing shot that works much like the first: in what we'll call a very [long shot](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48039), the world is still white and empty of all but some men and trees. This is the classic Russian technique of turning a forest into the cinematic equivalent of a barren desert: the only life visible is either human or snow-coated evergreen. These riders aren't as tiny as they were in the opening shot, but the scale still makes them appear vulnerable because they're still dominated by the other elements of the frame. The [deep focus] (http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#38561)suggests that all of the elements in the scene may be of equal importance, which is strange because the only visible elements are the people and the trees. Combined with the relatively [high-key lighting](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/mise-en-scene.htm#140477), which should allow us to see everything in the scene, the deep focus creates the conflicting impression that we _can_ see everything in the scene, but that there's something in it that we're still not seeing. But if it's there why can't we see it?

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00006](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fd90af970b-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00006")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fd90af970b-popup)  
It could be because _we_ are the something we can't see and we're watching the riders approach from our [point-of-view](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48019). Intimating that camera's perspective belongs to something monstrous is quite common in horror films and series. For example, the first episode of _The Walking Dead_, "Days Gone By," [fiddled with this suggested perspective for nearly five minutes](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/amc-the-walking-dead-series-lecture-notes.html) before dispensing with the conceit. Van Patten only plays with it momentarily, but the effect is unsettling enough because as the riders move closer to the camera, their faces become more distinct, and the more we can distinguish about them from their faces, the more likely we are sympathize with them. In the [long shot](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48039) above, the rider's face betrays a wariness about what's behind the trees, and well he should, because it might be us and we might be a monster. We're not. However!

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00011](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db41b9970d-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00011")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db41b9970d-popup)  
Over there! What's over there? The [medium long shot](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48043) allows us not only to see his face, but to see it clearly enough for Van Patten to create an [eyeline match](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#98485) between what Will and what he sees:

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00012](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fda0de970b-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00012")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fda0de970b-popup)  
What is that? Another long shot of trees in deep focus. It should be disconcerting for the same reason the previous long shot of trees in deep focus was: we _should_ be able to see everything in the shot, but there's nothing that demands our attention except maybe a little mist. The shot is highly structured: on the vertical axis, two trees occupy the central area and two more flank the left and right sides of the frame. A single line of dark something bisects the frame horizontally. When a shot is this structured it suggests either [literal] (http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/02/doctor-who-time-of-angels-lecture-notes.html)or [figurative](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/09/mad-men-in-the-suitcase.html) confinement. Encountering the symmetry of entrapment in the middle of a vast wood compounds the earlier disquieting suggestions and doesn't Will know it:

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00013](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c0c53970c-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00013")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c0c53970c-popup)  
Or maybe he doesn't. The [medium close-up](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48047) alone just indicates that we're looking at him looking at those eerily symmetrical trees. But wait!

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00014](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3209e41d970b-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00014")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3209e41d970b-popup)  
Van Patten begins [zooming](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48521) in from the medium close-up into [a genuine close-up](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48048). We may have the beginning of what I refer to as a "[thinking zoom](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/01/follow-that-thought.html)," in which a director zooms in on a character's face in order to indicate that that character has had a thought. Did Will?

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00017](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdb183970b-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00017")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdb183970b-popup)  
Will most certainly did. Note that when Van Patten zoomed into the [extreme close-up](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48049) he also elevates the [level of framing](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48009) slightly in order to emphasize Will's widening eyes. Will's not just thinking that there's something's odd about those trees, he believes he's seen something that verifies his thoughts. He's not sure he's seen what he thinks he's seen but he's not about to take a chance:

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00020](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db61bc970d-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00020")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db61bc970d-popup)  
He climbs a drift to take a closer look at the trees and examine what he thinks he might have seen. He looks to his left and Van Patten employs another eyeline match to show us what Will sees near that mist:

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00021](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdbb07970b-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00021")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdbb07970b-popup)  
The long shot of the mist clears up one thing: it's smoke not mist. But the long shot doesn't provide enough visual information for us to make any sense of it. There's smoke and some other things there but it's difficult to discern what those other things are. But there are some disturbing inferences for Will to draw from what he can see: the first is that these riders aren't alone, someone else set and abandoned that fire; the second is that something bad may have happened to that someone else because people don't abandon fires in this environment unless they have good reason to. Why am I discussing this long shot as if it's a point-of-view shot from Will's perspective? Because I think it is. Van Patten's bridging these shots together via eyeline matches:

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00024](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db6d4d970d-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00024")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db6d4d970d-popup)  
When he cuts back to Will behind the drift, Will looks to his right instead of his left this time and sees:

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00025](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c3823a7970c-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00025")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c3823a7970c-popup)  
An extreme close-up of a head upon a stake. The zoom from the long shot of the smoke to the close-up of the head is the point-of-view equivalent of the thinking zoom. Instead of zooming into the mind of the character thinking, this zoom approximates what happens when a perspectival character paying more attention to an object in the [mise-en-scene](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/basic-terms.htm#16992). Van Patten provides further evidence that Will's been thinking when he cuts back to him:

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00030](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdcbbb970b-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00030")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdcbbb970b-popup)  
Moving in to a close-up on the reverse is something like an implied thinking zoom. It also provides us with a better opportunity to read Will's face and sympathize with the horror written upon it. There's an intimacy to a close-up that naturally engenders sympathy in audience members who capable of it. It can also be quite creepy, as demonstrated by [the image from] (http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/graphics/ewsclose.jpg)_[Eyes Wide Shut](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/graphics/ewsclose.jpg)_ that the Yale Film Analysis site uses an example. Where exactly are we, the audience, in relation to Cruise and Kidman in that shot? That's right: we're standing three inches from their noses while they're making out. Point being: we can more clearly read Will's face now and that allows us to better sympathize with the dismay he feels at what he's seeing. Which is:

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00031](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c33a2970c-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00031")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c33a2970c-popup)  
He looked to his left and his right before looking straight ahead and taking in the whole scene. Remember earlier when I mentioned that the high-key lighting and deep focus suggested that we should've been able to see something that wasn't there? This may be that something. Even the way Van Patten edited this sequence suggests that this is something Will didn't want to be seeing: he looked left and couldn't make it out, looked right and noticed the head on the stake, and only then did he confront what he didn't want to see. But there the ghastly scene is and he has no choice but to survey it. Then of course run. Running is a bad thing for a member of the Night's Watch to do: the penalty for running is death. His companions think him a coward and ask him if he wants to run. He declines and decides to return to the scene of the massacre. But when he returns with his fellow riders there's nothing there. No mutilated corpses. No heads on spikes. Just trees and snows and the remains of that fire and what's this?

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00051](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fde6f2970b-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00051")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fde6f2970b-popup)

Let's have a closer look at that:

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00234](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c49d0970c-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00234")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c49d0970c-popup)

It's a red something.

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00235](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db9709970d-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00235")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db9709970d-popup)

A red what?

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00233](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdec61970b-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00233")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdec61970b-popup)  
A red something that's not as important as what's behind you.

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00059](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c4c8d970c-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00059")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c4c8d970c-popup)  
You mean the trees and snow?

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00062](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db995c970d-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00062")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db995c970d-popup)  
He doesn't mean the trees and snow. Note the difference in the [depth of field](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#38662) in this series of [reverse shots](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#51531). The rider with the red something is shot in deep focus, whereas his companion is shot in [shallow](http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#38599). The shallow focus allows the white walker to enter the frame without being immediately intelligible. It's a tall something with blue eyes whose creepiness is partly a function of our inability to see exactly who or what it is. Like the earlier shots of the forest, this use of shallow focus is another means of showing the audience what's there without exactly showing us what's there. The horror, in short, is a function of what we imagine we see when it's not there and can't quite focus on when it is. The least horrifying shot in the sequence is the one immediately above because we can so clearly see what's in it. But that's only because I captured one of the two or three frames in which the white walker's visible. If you watch the episode, that frame occupies the screen for a split-second before Van Patten cuts to poor Will:

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00065](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdfd26970b-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00065")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdfd26970b-popup)  
Poor Will who was right about everything but not believed. Van Patten continues using shallow focus here because he's already established that terrible things can appear in it. As it happens what's frightening Will now is directly in front of him: it's the white walker about to behead his only remaining companion. Will now has no choice but to run, and run with the knowledge that he's running _from_ one certain death _to_ another. Which is exactly what happens:

[![Games of thrones - winter is coming00125](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c6629970c-500wi "Games of thrones - winter is coming00125")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c6629970c-popup)  
The transition from the snow-covered forest to the green field full of knights straddles the opening credit sequence, but the contrast makes it point nonetheless: not only has poor Will run, he's run quite far and possibly for quite some time, but he hasn't outrun the horrors he saw or the death he sentenced himself to. He could've chosen to die at the hands of the white walker beyond the wall, but instead he ran until reached Winterfell, where at least he'll die at the hands of human being. 

All of which is very sad. 

Which was my point: Van Patten creates a very sympathetic portrayal of Will in order to use that sympathy to distinguish the perspectives of the characters in Winterfell by virtue of how they react to him. He can't replicate the structure of the book, but as I'll discuss tomorrow, he can create situations in which the content of those individual chapters is efficiently communicated.

I use this same opening scene whenever I want to just introduce the series/books.

There's something else going on in this scene as well: The arrangement of the "Winter is Coming" bodies in the circle is weirdly symbolic, i.e. it seems structured like some kind of symbol. Jump ahead to the end of season one to "Fire and Blood," and Drogo's funeral pyre is reminiscent of that same structure. 

[http://bit.ly/RwGMAi](http://bit.ly/RwGMAi)

A Song of Ice and Fire: _Winter_ is Coming, _Fire_ and Blood, the land of always winter vs the desert, yet that death symbol links them all. It's an interesting way to visually tie the end of the first season back to its origins.

That's a damn fine point, and one I'll return to when I get to "Fire and Blood." I wonder if it's described similarly in the books as well? I suppose I'll find out as I re-read them for the class. (I'd just flip to the chapter, but that's one thing the Kindle's just rot at.) But I like the idea that I completely missed: the frost desert in the first episode and the actual one in the last, possibly linked by the same symbol somehow found half a world away. I don't want to head in a Von Daniken, but I don't think I'd have to.

And for the record, even if I don't respond to all your posts, I just want to say that I've really appreciated your comments of late. I end up thinking about them more often than responding to them for some reason. I'll try to rectify that in the future. But I just wanted you to know that they're greatly appreciated.

_"I wonder if it's described similarly in the books as well?"_ No, both of those visual ideas were original to the show. And the director's comments on "Fire and Blood" said (IIRC) that the arrangement of the pyre was something they came up with fairly late in the making of that episode, so if there was an intended connection it wasn't planned from episode 1.

Nope, Hob's right -- there's nothing in the text about the shape of those death-piles, although Ser Waymar Royce asks Will if he noted the "position of the bodies."

Thanks for the kudos -- and no worries about responding or not responding. I'm just a lapsed literature/visual rhetoric PhD who's getting my critical fix. Came across your blog years ago via Kugelmass, put it on Google Reader, but never really checked Google Reader until relatively recently. Happy I did.

(Had a big response to one of the Louie posts, but it didn't submit. I saved it because my wife wanted to read it; maybe I'll try to post it again.)

The portrayal of Game of Thrones is much different when expressed as a show, rather than a novel.  High fantasy is sadly ignored in films and television, probably because recreating a fantasy novel is a lengthy task. However, the major components of a high fantasy novel are the content and descriptive qualities surrounding the folklore itself. While I believe think the show’s directing by Tim Van Patten, does the story justice, many things are left out in the first scenes that were in the novel. The internal character’s feelings in the first scenes, expressed in detail in the novel, are left out of the television show. This includes Will’s feelings towards Ser Waymar Royce.  It leaves audiences with a lot of room to use their imagination and doesn’t focus on Will as a major character, but rather as a scapegoat to start the novel, by foreshadowing the brutality and intensity of the show. The writers have focused on only enough details for each scene to make it to the next.  In a 52 minute episode, there is not enough time to fully access internal representations or body language that characters may be experiencing. Will’s fate was portrayed with a lot less emphasis in the television show. The entire opening scene is cut short and doesn’t seem to have a very weighty structural benefit, although it does serve the same purpose as a general introduction to viewers. Director Van Patten, chose to alter the depiction of Will, because he has to portray a myriad of character introductions in the first episode, as well as paint accurate portrayals in a very short time span. The depiction of Will’s fate, and as a character, is a lot less important than the introduction of royalty.

The first two episodes of Game of Thrones give the viewer a lot of detail to think about as the story unfolds. Every small subtlety that Van Patten includes, gives the viewer a remarkably cohesive representation that can condense chapters of a fantasy novel into 55 minute episodes. On the Acephalous Blog (Game of Thrones Post 2), the claustrophobic effect inside of the castle is addressed. Will is not viewed as significant to the characters in this shot, so I don’t believe it was supposed to invoke any sense of urgency. I believe that the most important element in the shot is the intimate connection between Ned and Catelyn. Again, the shot does not portray a sense of urgency; it is just addressing the natural Stark family values and shows the viewer, through special proximity, the underlying emphasis on family values and lineage. In the first blog post, the medium “thinking zoom” pertaining to Will was discussed. I believe that Will is just a scapegoat for the viewers, leading to a greater understanding of the Stark family values and the introduction of the White Walkers. I don’t think you could really categorize this as a “complete thinking zoom,” from Will’s perspective. Rather, I think Van Patten was trying to emphasize the sheer terror in Will’s facial expression and helplessness of the extreme danger of the situation. The viewers already know that if Will deserts the battlefield, he will be killed for being a deserter. Will’s only significance is that he is the perfect catalyst for the conflict to commence. Also, before Ser Waymar Royce is attacked by the White Walker, the White Walker is shown in a medium, shallow focus. As viewers, we can infer from the focus that this character is not prominent on the continent of Westeros.
