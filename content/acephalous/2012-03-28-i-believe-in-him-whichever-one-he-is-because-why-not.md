## I believe in Him, whichever one He is, because why not?

Outside watering the plants this evening I came across an image of my new Savior:

[![Angry soot man 01](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0167645cc945970b-500wi "Angry soot man 01")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0167645cc945970b-popup)  
As he appeared to be blowing soot at me, I took that volcanic plume emenating from his head to indicate that my new Savior was some sort of Fire Lord. Then it occurred to me that I might've been seeing my new Savior from the wrong angle, which it turns out was true:

[![Angry soot man 02](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0167645cde25970b-500wi "Angry soot man 02")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0167645cde25970b-popup)  
Turns out my Savior is a poorly coiffed but vigorously bearded man who met an unfortunate end when someone put a bullet in his head.

This, my readers, [is what students believe rhetoric teachers do in their classrooms](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/03/filming-the-sausage-being-made-is-very-very-expensive-my-friends). Fun as it may be to find meaning in a meaningless world, that's not actually what we do. That "man" I photographed above had evaporated before I returned from the kitchen with the water jug that'd created "him."

I'll take an antecedent for $200, Alex.
