[_If this strikes you as a peculiar thing to appear on this blog,   that's only because it is. It's a serialized novel that I'll be writing   over the next few months._]

He remembers the first time it happened. It is his earliest memory.   A. had awoken eager to walk along the banks of one of the city's three   rivers—he cannot remember which one—on that morning. He cherished these   rare moments to himself, far from the wailing of E., his new brother.   His mother insisted he not stray too far from home, but A. knew the area   well and that E. would prevent her from following him, so he ranged   rather further than he led her to believe.

But on this particular morning, A. felt differently adventurous, so   he followed his father to the small walled garden occupied by his   family's honey bees. The bees frightened him, but he thought if he   harvested a comb of honey he could prove to his father he was more   worthy of attention than E. He hid behind the bushes lining the front   wall and waited for his father to leave. It felt like hours before his   father tired of his toil, but eventually he exited the small garden   through the side gate and made for his favored tavern. A. allowed a few   minutes to pass in case his father—who was always forgetting   something—had forgotten something. He emerged from the bushes and   approached the clay pots that housed the hives.

When the first bee crawled from the nearest pot and took flight, A.   felt a strong urge to follow suit. He closed his eyes. He heard the bee   circle his head twice, then once more, before he felt it settle on his   shoulder. He wondered whether the bee recognized that he was his   father's son and pride shuddered through his young body. The bee had   tested him and not found him wanting. His mettle steeled, he opened his   eyes and glanced at his shoulder. The tiny bee made no effort to sting   him, nor did it seem in any hurry to leave. A. took this as a good omen   and stepped closer to the hive from which his new friend had departed.

He reached the hive and peered down into it. His new friend had many   old ones. They danced up and down the walls of the honey combs in what   A. could discern to be a pattern. He admired the orderliness of their   movement, though he could not discover its purpose. Suddenly, he heard a   footfall from beyond the wall. It had the character of a sound made by   someone trying not to make sound. A. knew it could not be his  father,  because when his father returned from the tavern his feet made  no  effort to hide their tread. He waited, as still and silent in the   garden as his new friend was upon his shoulder. One minute passed. Two   minutes. Three. He decided that he had imagined the sound and returned   his attention to the pot before him.

He slipped his hand down the side of the comb and attempted, gently,   to dislodge it. His efforts resulted in the arrival of even more new   friends. They lit upon his arm but, unlike his first friend, they were   not still and silent. They made a noise that sounded like the air before   a thunderstorm felt. Their orderly dance had been disrupted and they   seemed upset about its abandonment. It was not until his first friend   joined the rest of his hive in voicing its displeasure that A. began to   worry. And worry he did. He removed his hand from the comb and began to   retract it, slowly, slowly, from the pot. His hand was nearly free  when  he heard the front gate slam open. The bees heard too, but they  seemed  not to care who had been intruding where, only that an intrusion  had  occurred. A. felt a thousand tiny needles stab his hand. He reeled  back,  but the offense had already been given and must have been quite  grave  because the hive did not relent. He looked to the front gate—if  he could  make it to the gate he could jump into the river—and only then   remembered what had startled the bees in the first place.

A man in a strange black coat stood in the gateway. His hair and   complexion were dark, much like A.'s own, but his whiskers were unlike   any A. had ever seen. He had something in his hand. The man shouted   something that A. could not understand and began to run toward him. A.   tried to say something but a bee flew in his mouth. He hoped it was not   his friend, but there was no time to mourn.

The man was upon him.

The world went black. The sharp pains in his hand were replaced by   deep pains everywhere else. A. desperately clutched at the black but a   new pain arrived every second: on his head, in his chest, to his   stomach. He felt the ground beneath him go slick. He tried to slip away   but the blackness was too strong. The pains continued to arrive for  what  must have been hours. When the blackness finally drew back, A.  found  himself staring at a blue sky. The bees were still panicking but   appeared to have lost interest in him. His back felt wet and the world   smelled of shit and sick. He tried to move but the attempt only brought   more pain.

Then the man returned. He leaned over A. and grabbed him by the hair.   He shouted another string of words which had no meaning to A. and  shook  him. A. could no longer judge which of his many pains he was  feeling.  When the man struck him in the face with the object in his  right hand,  A. ceased to care. He no longer felt pain—he had become  pain. He longed  for the blackness to return and, quickly enough, it  did.

It was light when he awoke, in his own bed, still very much in pain.   Outside the door he could hear his parents arguing, as he would many   times again, about what had happened. About why A. had been near the   hives and how lucky they were that his father returned when he had. He   learned that there had been a confrontation, but that the man had   escaped his father, and that they had not been able to find him. A. did   not want to think about that. Not now, not ever again.

But think about it he would, again and again, because this was only the first time it happened.

Thanks, y'all. As for why I need an editor: I overwrite things. Or I get stuck in repetitive sentence structures. Plus I'm still undecided if this works better if you know the spoilers or don't. In other words, I don't write much fiction and worry I'm making an ass of myself when I do.

I don't think the header was there when I read this yesterday....

A _novel with a punchline_?!? That's a hell of a lot of work for a shaggy-dog chuckle. Unless the payoff goes well beyond the punchline, isn't that why God gave us short stories? (cf. Asimov, "Shah Guido G.", "In Bad Taste", etc, ad nauseum, unless you like that sort of thing, as I do)
