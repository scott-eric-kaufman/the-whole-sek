## One Drawback to Being a Detail-Oriented Misanthrope ...

... is that random Canadians will [diagnose you](http://www.piepalace.ca/blog/asperger-test-aq-test/) with Asperger syndrome:
The test assesses five different areas. Autistic-like responses will show poor
social skill, attention switching, communication and imagination, and an
exaggerated attention to detail. In other words, geekiness. You scored 
35
. Scores over 32 are generally taken to indicate Asperger's Syndrome or
high-functioning autism, with more than 34 an "extreme" score.

I don't have poor social skills—I'm a charmer!  I'm exquisitely communicative and  quite imaginative—look at all the [great](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my\_morning.html) [stories](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/sample\_student\_.html) I [invented](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/infamous\_liar\_k.html) [whole](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/why\_i\_didnt\_pos.html)-[cloth](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/and\_yet\_i\_still.html) [for](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/who\_can\_write\_i.html) [your](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/fixing\_a\_hole\_w.html) [amusement](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/disadventure.html)!  

But I'll cop to an exaggerated attention to detail.  I _do_ pay too much attention to things that don't matter.  But this talent allows me to discover tiny things liable to escape the notice of people with perspective.  Were I less detail-oriented, I may have finished the dissertation already ... but it wouldn't have nearly as many footnotes.  And footnotes—especially when of dubious relevance—are what _really_ makes a monograph look [scholarly](http://itself.wordpress.com/2007/07/24/rigors-just-another-name-for-nothing-left-to-lose-or-refutation-through-accurate-summary/).  

On an unrelated note, I found [this post](http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/2007/07/the\_neuroscience\_of\_adhd\_1.php) and the comments it generated so interesting I kept the tab open for three or four days.

I too have been diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome over the internet, through a polite and discreet email.  That's pretty funny.

Wow - this test is actually circulating around the internet? 

I scored a 15. I don't really have much detail to exaggerate over, however.

I am confused. I can't tell if I'm better than those who have a lower score than I do, or if they're better than I am. How do you win this game?

The lower the score, the less geeky you are. Of course, this being an academic blog which invites academic and/or literary types, it wouldn't be unsound if most of the people taking it would score a lot higher than most people. 

Besides, wouldn't people who obsess going to the gym or being the perfection of cosmetic beauty have Asperger's syndrome as well? What about people-obsessed? Excessive talkers? "Gift of gab" versus "Bane of blabber." I don't know.

Considering the current state of society, I am not sure that we of the Almost Asperger's Community are entirely to blame.

This only confirms my suspicion that the reason I so often fail to get along with people on the Internet is that there is something wrong with _everyone else_.

Autism related stuff tends to be really spectrum-y so a lot of factors combine together to produce the effects of it.  So quite a few of the factors can be true for you and effect your life without them combining like voltron into an autistic lion.  Also, many of the lower level symptoms are similar to the symptoms of other issues, many of which are non-medical.  Serious academics tend to be detail oriented and relatively asocial, etc.  This raises a kind of chicken-or-the-egg question:  did my academic career instill these things in me or did I find academia a comfortable place because I was already that way?

For me, it's probably a little of both.  I've been pretty asocial from day one.  I have a pretty keen social intuition as far as reading people goes(definitely not an aspergers symptom) but for me this never really translated into a strong intuition as to what behavior would be appropriate on my part.  I know the social protocols, I just have to think about them consciously.  So social situations around people I don't know very well are very stressful for me because I'm "processing" the whole time and so talking to strangers is kind of like taking the SAT (this IS an HFA symptom.)  

Also, I've always been all kinds of ADD (not really any H though) and so that complicates things.  ADD is another one of those things where there are a lot of factors that we don't understand and many of them overlap with other things (as per that discussion you linked to.)  Some of the factors overlap with autism spectrum disorders, and interestingly, the strong habits I've developed to cope with my ADD push my behavior a little more towards the autism spectrum.  To combat distraction, I've done the following things:  cut quite a bit of what I don't have to concentrate on out of my life, learned to value finishing things to an extreme degree and learned to trigger hyperfocus on anything which presents a problem to me.  

Being an scholarly type has probably exacerbated these symptoms noticeably.  First, a tendency to hyperfocus is a common ADD symptom but it's only become a big part of my daily life as I've gotten more and more serious about scholarship. Secondly, my social skills have been affected somewhat because I spend nearly all my time concentrating on things which cannot be easily summed up for polite conversation and so my ability to communicate with people who are not my friends has diminished.

So I can imagine that variations on this scenario are common in certain ways.  "Nerdy" disciplines are natural places for people who already display a few of the attributes shared by Aspergers or HFA types and those very attributes can in some ways be brought out by the demands of the discipline.

Jake, I think people-obsessed people are disqualified on the people front, which is one of the reasons I found my score so high: I _am_, in fact, [people](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/01/reflections\_on\_.html) tend to like me, and I can move smoothly between different social circles.  I'm as comfortable shooting the shit about sports as I am slagging Lacan, and can shift between the two with frightening speed.  (Only in certain company,  as when Kugelmass comes over.)  The thing is, I simply prefer _not_ to socialize at this point in my life.  (Except online, that is.)  The very thought of showering, shaving, getting a haircut, dressing reasonably, leaving the house, &c. exhausts me, so I very rarely do it.  I think J.S. Nelson's notion of a constellation of symptoms becoming a reasonable approximation of Asperger is probably responsible for my result.  (Not that I've expended much energy thinking about it.)

J.S. Nelson, I'm on board the ADD-taught-me-how-to-concentrate train.  I was diagnosed the end of my senior year of high school.  I graduated with a 1.7 GPA, then went on to earn on B my entire college career.  Amazing how the mere acknowledgment of the problem changes everything; I mean, once I learned I had something to cope with, life suddenly made much more sense.  

Along the same chicken-egg line you draw above, I'd put this question: if you took a normal person, told them they had ADD and treated them accordingly, would they become more academic, or merely pay more attention to video games?  Would they play different video games, tiring of _Guitar Hero_ and moving to _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_, then from there to _Civilization_?

It depends on the person and what treating them accordingly means.  Presuming you could convince someone that they did, it would depend on their motivations.  

There are two ways you can use the knowledge that you have ADD.  You can use it as a diagnosis and move on to a kind of "treatment" IE developing skills and habits to minimize the damage done and capitalize on the strengths (or medication, which has pretty different effects on non-ADD people).  If a normal person tried this they might see some improvement, but I think they might figure out they don't have ADD when they don't come up against much resistance.  

The other way you can use it is as an excuse for indulging in any behavior typically associated with ADD people.  Unfortunately, I suspect that this one would be more likely, especially if the person is not actually faced with the real problems associated with ADD.

I had a kind of "scared straight"/Good Will Hunting experience as far as this sort of thing goes.  They caught my ADD pretty early, put me on medication and even moved me to a montessori middle through high school which purported to be a better environment for me.  The problem was my parents and teachers had a really "neurodiverse" attitude toward me so basically I was just taught that I was different and that it was unfortunate that the world didn't better accommodate my differences.  

Long story short, I embraced my differences, became an anarchist, did drugs, read philosophy instead of doing homework, dropped out of high school, etc.  

Then I got a job as a construction worker for a while, and the guy who I worked for had essentially the same story as me:  smart guy, liked philosophy, dropped out because he didn't want to deal with The Man.  Now he's 60 and builds rich people's houses.  

So I rocked the SATs and went back to school.  Thinking for a living is more fun long term than operating a chipping hammer.

_The very thought of showering, shaving, getting a haircut, dressing reasonably, leaving the house, &c. exhausts me, so I very rarely do it._

But has there been any abnormal behavior?
