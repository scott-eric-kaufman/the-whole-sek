## But I distinctly remember being told that on the internet, no one would know I'm a dog!

Another [illusion shattered](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/objectification-hypocrisy.html). I am, in fact, "an ugly little twerp, and [Donald Douglas doesn't] mean that figuratively."  He means that _literally_: the [average height of American males](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human\_height#Average\_height\_around\_the\_world) is 5'10", so people who are 6'1" like me are _literally_ little.  We are _literally_ dwarfed by all those people three inches shorter than us.  As to the rest, Douglas declares his intention to "eschew substantive comments on [the argument I] posted" in favor of unadulterated _ad hominem_:

		

					[]()
			

*   I'm a "miniscule academic mountebank"
*   I represent "all that is genuinely wicked and destructive in university culture today"
*   I'm a "hate-pimp"
*   I'm "a merchant of hate of the most despicable kind"
*   I'm a "spindle of a man"
*   I disparage "a true-academic's babe-blogging"

I also know how to use a hyphen properly, but that's neither here nor there.  Douglas's only defense for the material he posts is that it "doesn't bother [him] a bit" because "it's a free world, you know."  I actually didn't know that, but I do know that I'm not surprised that Douglas read a post about material _his students_ might find unsettling and responded by claiming that it doesn't bothers _him._

He thinks _you_ got dissed by your commenters? The commenters who are roughly evenly divided between those who think you pulled your (figurative) punches and those who literally think he's not worth your time? _You_ got dissed? By _us_?

That is industrial-grade denial. That's "I'm sure we'll find WMD in Iraq any day now"-strength self-delusion. Not to mention what it says about his reading comprehension: I wonder what getting graded by him is like?

Matt Yglesias, also 6'1", was also accused of shortness awhile back. He speculated that perhaps he has a short-person writing style. Another theory is that Jews are short by definition.

David Cross, with the final word on people who misuse the word "literally":

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ly1UTgiBXM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ly1UTgiBXM)

The last line you quote is Douglas in a nutshell. Anyone with a pulse knows there's nothing academic about his posting of stroke pics; creating that juxtaposition between highbrow and low allows him to position dimestore misogyny as transgressive.

You're just showing off your fancy-but-made-up degree of Doctor of Philosophy of English by using the literal definition of literal.  Machiavelli, with great elan, routinely dismissed his opponents as "hate-pimps," while not taking long walks on beaches.

Would a "hate-pimp" imply "hate-prostitutes"? If so, what would said prostitutes **do**? I have any number of conjectures on that point, but my best guess is that it's like this:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFKtI6gn9Y](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFKtI6gn9Y)

Which leads me to conclude Mr. Douglas must right, since I think we can all agree that if anyone has ever actually paid to have a complete stranger hate him, it's Mr. Douglas.

Time to fess up, Mr. Kaufman: how many hate-prostitutes are in your employ?

Alternately, you could his post -- in which he goes on and on for hundreds and hundreds of words repeating how beneath his notice you are -- in a rhetoric class as an example of 'irony'.

Every time I read one of Douglas's posts, some small part of me can't help but suspect that his blog might be an elaborate put-on, like a rabid or BSE-stricken Jon Swift. But then, I really am short, so what do I know?

One thing is for certain (and something I had reinforced over the last couple of days):  it is impossible to engage in reasonable dialog with the man.  He responses with a combo of talk radioesque shtick and convoluted semi-arguments that ultimately make no sense.

This is why I've opted for open mockery.  He really does seem to write solely for the hits, which is something I just don't understand: how can you hold that people take you seriously when you know the majority of your "readers" are there for the half-naked women?  This is one of those cases when integrity is its own comfort: everyone who comes here arrives because of something I've written or an image that's directly related to something I've written.

Sorry SEK, but I only come here because I'm a butt-freak for your stature-challenged writing style (it isn't what the words say or the paragraphs mean, but their generally diminutive size, y'understand) and utter lack of tactical elan... (But I'm just a radical nihilist and [demonic attack master](http://commonsensepoliticalthought.com/?p=8651#comment-571851) extraordinaire, so what do I know...?)
