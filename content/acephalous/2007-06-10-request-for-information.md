## Request for Information

As it now appears I am being cyber-stalked (or cyber-harassed), I
need to acquire definitive information.  The person stalking me claims
to be "John Casper," and he writes from a Hotmail account.  Thanks to
the tireless efforts of "anonymous," I have reason to believe [he is the same "John Casper"](http://www.firedoglake.com/2007/02/28/a-tale-of-two-georges/#comment-529416)
who frequently comments at FireDogLake.  I have contacted the General
and the writers of FDL requesting IP addresses but have yet to hear
back.  Please email me (scotterickaufman [at] gmail [dot] com) if you have any information about the identity
of "John Casper" or "The Ghost of Adolph Rupp."

When you fear for your safety as a person actually being stalked fears for their safety, you should write about that as cyberstalking.

Until then, you're just being harassed.

Let's not water down crimes.

Er, Anon? The Ghost is trying to ruin Scott's career. Since you're bravely anon, I don't know whether or not you know how academia works, but, believe me, what's happening is as serious as crabs.
