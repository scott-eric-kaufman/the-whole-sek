			I can't help but wonder what readers of the _Raw Story_ think of me, as on Friday, my first day of work, I wrote about [puppies](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/08/09/a-golden-retriever-puppy-is-spoon-fed-melts-your-heart/), [the Cato Institute](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/08/09/conservative-group-with-ties-to-koch-brothers-slams-democratic-senator-for-holding-stand-your-ground-hearings/), [the Holocaust](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/08/09/teens-bused-to-albuquerque-to-protest-abortion-holocaust-outside-actual-holocaust-museum/), and [penises](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/08/09/australian-politician-resigns-after-alleged-mistress-shares-selfie-of-his-penis-in-a-glass-of-red-wine/). What kind of person would do such a thing?

No, Iâ€™m not sure either. 

But I will say that, two days later, I'm even more fond of the title of my Holocaust piece than I was when I wrote it.
