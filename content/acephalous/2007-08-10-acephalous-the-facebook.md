For no particular reason, I started an Acephalous group in Facebook.  I aim to net all the big theorists by next week.  Imagine the fun you'll have plastering Stanley Fish's wall with questions he already has the answers to.

If you comment here under a pseudonym, have no fears about joining: I'll privatize the group as soon as Facebook recognizes my authority over it.  (Which should be within the next hour.)
