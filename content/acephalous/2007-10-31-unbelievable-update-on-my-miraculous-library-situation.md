## (Unbelievable) Update on my "Miraculous" Library Situation

After I posted about my "miraculous" [encounter with the library](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/cashier.html), Rich noted that such things [only ever seem to happen to me](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/cashier.html#comment-87190206).  Everyone—spouses, parents, readers, and [co-panelists](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/announcement-is.html)—agrees: I attract the absurd.  

But sometimes I suspect people think I invent these absurd situations in order to drive up traffic.  Who else could [_insert all that I've endured_] in so short a time-frame?  To be frank: sometimes _I_ think I make it all up.  So it doesn't hurt to have evidence my insanity's not imagined.  

Proof in point: this letter I received from the library today, scanned for your convenience:

[![Library1](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/2007/10/31/library1.jpg "Library1")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/10/31/library1.jpg)

Words fail me.

Some trusty words never fail me in these situations.  But also:

_Oh no they didn't!_

If they received $1,200,000 for the year, and $2,600 or so of that was your funds, then you personally contributed about 2%!o(MISSING)f their donations for the year.  Perhaps there really weren't any donations of any other type; perhaps there are just 49 other students wandering around, thinking that this mixup will be fixed any day now.

My serious suggestion: have your lawyer friend write a letter to them.  More humorously, you could ask to meet the library's development staff (or management in general), given that you're a major donor, and then explain to them that they're absconded with your money.

I think I'd echo: 'Oh no they didn't!'  

I think this sort of thing is designed to make you think twice about asking for your money back - it's gone to a good cause.  Either that, or no one has heard anything you've said to them about it being fees money.  I don't know which is worse...

Hope you get it sorted out.

i think they are making you an offer you cannot refuse - i would stop trying to get your money back and pray that you don't wake up with a head of a horse in your bed. seriously, these people put you among their "friends and partners" and **in bold** as well - it's like saying: "hey, you're family now! family don't ask questions!"

O\_o 

On one hand, you sort of have to admire their guts.

Floyd, 

_Oh Yes They Did!_  Ugh.  The situation's due to resolve itself today, though, so there's comfort in that.

Rich, 

That would be ... absolutely amazing if true, and sadly, I can actually _imagine_ it being true, given the hoops I jumped through the past two weeks.

Autumn Song,

I think you're right: this was an automatic letter generated by some program within the vast university bureaucracy.

Mikhail, 

But I was _already_ family.  Or close to it.   After all, they let me borrow their books, and that's what friends and partners do, right?  Did they really need $2,600 to prove my love?

History Geek,

Yes, and want to stomp on them.

Rich meant .2%!n(MISSING)ot 2%!,(MISSING) right?  It's an awful and ridiculous situation, to be sure, but Scott isn't quite a 1/50th shareholder in the library yet...

Yeah, I slipped a digit.  I suppose that it would be a bit too much to think of 499 other students in the same situation.

Probably, Rich, but I only meant to clarify the math.  I still really liked--in a half-laughing, half-crying kind of way, of course, being a grad student myself--the basic conceit.

This is what we like to call the "unintended donation" con. It works especially well with old people. Forget a wallet at the check-out desk, that's a donation. "Misplace" a purse, that's a donation. The thank you letters are a necessary formality because, after all, we're a respectable business.   

Again, on behalf of the library system, thank you for your, ah, "generosity." Capish?

hahaha...if only I didn't think you had actually cleverly doctored the dept's electronic letterhead to fake this...
