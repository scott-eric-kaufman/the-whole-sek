## Statistical Analysis?  Don't Want It.  We Prefer "Real Facts."

(_x-post from the Valve_)

I’ve seen [this article](http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer\_preview.asp?idArticle=13484&R=113052D5CF) by Mary Eberstadt roll across [Phi Beta Cons](http://phibetacons.nationalreview.com/) twice this past week, so I can only conclude they really, really want people to read it.  Why?  To _debunk_ it, obviously.  Who am I not to oblige?

In “Do Campuses Tilt Left?” Eberstadt attacks the conclusions of
the American Federation of Teachers’ recent report “The ‘Faculty Bias’
Studies: Science or Propaganda?” The AFT paper analyzes eight studies
purporting to show systemic liberal bias in higher education in order
to determine whether or not they’re methodologically sound.  The
conclusion?  They fail to meet minimum research standards.  In
particular:

The studies were evaluated using five research
principles that help to establish whether the authors are
overgeneralizing based on limited or flawed collection and
interpretation of data.  These principles help to differentiate _anecdotal
evidence that is hand-picked to support a particular point of view and
systemic observation that leads to valid conclusions_.

The emphasis is mine.  In my defense, I couldn’t help myself.  To
refute the claim that these studies hand-pick anecdotal evidence to
support a particular point, Eberstadt presents “a few _examples_ from what _could be a longer list_,” all from the mouths of prominent movement conservatives:

“I watched with horror as the multicultural yahoos took over the humanities” (the Manhattan Institute’s Heather MacDonald). 

“I’d been preaching freedom of speech, but I had to leave the academy
for the world of policy think tanks before I’d ever get a chance to
practice it” (Ethics and Public Policy Center senior fellow Stanley
Kurtz, formerly of Berkeley, Chicago, and Harvard). 

“Of course the vast majority of the faculty [at Harvard] were on the
left” (Hoover Institution senior fellow and former Harvard professor
Peter Berkowitz). 

 “Because I studied neither economics nor Straussian philosophy [at
the University of Chicago], I never met a conservative professor, and I
knew only one conservative student” (David Brooks).

Earlier in the article, Eberstadt wrote that “so perverse is [the AFT]
report in conception and so quixotically oblivious to the inescapable
facts, that it might easily be mistaken for a sendup [and] that some
Swiftian wit had pulled off a brilliancy here.” To her bewilderment, I
add my own—for an article so “quixotically oblivious” must have been
written by a liberal satirizing a conservative.  How else to account
for the fact that “Eberstadt” responds to the AFT’s criticism of
studies relying on anecdotal evidence gathered without any control for
bias by hand-picking four anecdotes from a forthcoming collection
entitled _Why I Turned Right: Leading Baby Boom Conservatives Chronicle Their Political Journeys_? 

Since most people won’t read the study itself [[.pdf](http://www.aft.org/pubs-reports/higher\_ed/FacultyBiasStudies.pdf)],
I’ll share Eberstadt’s analysis of its highlights.  Eberstadt balks at
the study’s claim that “it is not possible with any precision to
calculate a ratio of Democrats to Republicans at the sampled
institutions.” Actually, Eberstadt cites it like this: “**I**t is
not possible with any precision to calculate a ratio of Democrats to
Republicans at the sampled institutions.” Makes it seem like “It” is
the first word in that sentence.  “It” isn’t.  The full sentence reads:
“_Given the low response rate, inadequate sampling and missing responses_,
it is not possible with any precision to calculate a ratio of Democrats
to Republicans at the sampled institution with any precision, _much less imply what might be the case for faculty members outside the sampling frame_.”
The first conveniently-elided clause gave the reasons for the AFT’s
verdict; the second, the reason why further conclusions shouldn’t be
drawn from those studies.  

After chuckling at the notion that “passing off personal opinions as
facts is not science,” she praises the methodologies of “nonscientists”
who gather “real facts”—like the ones she collected in _Why I Turned Right_—without
noticing that doing so undermines the legitimacy of the very
conclusions she defends.  (In principle, at least.) The cachet of these
studies comes from the illusion they past scientific muster.  The
obverse is instructive here: Eberstadt would never _intentionally_
argue that she prefers to base her opinions on unverifiable facts,
otherwise why include gestures to verifiability like giving “just a few
examples from a much longer list” or noting that her anecdote is “just
one among many stones one could kick to refute anyone who suggests”
that faculty bias isn’t as pervasive as she claims.  In those two
sentences, she appeals to the same standards she earlier derided, _i.e._
she would have the reader believe that a scientific survey—defined here
as “counting”—would validate her tendentious conclusions.  In this
respect, she resembles those Yankee fans who _insist_ that because Derek Jeter opens the season eight-for-ten, he’ll hit .800 the remainder of it.  In sabermetric circles, we this _wishcasting_.  

Eberstadt may have more of a point—the AFT study notes that, in all
likelihood, some disciplines are predominantly liberal—but until her
and her fellow critics show me a study methodologically sound enough to
earn a non-failing grade in Statistical Analysis 101, they’re merely
wishcasting.

How lame would it look if I mentioned that four of the five people mentioned by me in this post have already reached it via vanity Googling?  (I mean, for me, since I "happened" to check my site logs after I posted ... which I "never" do, "normally.")

Derek Jeter vanity-Googles?

Just kidding.  Seriously, the Hoover Institution and similar right-wing welfare snoozers have interns who are probably on continuous vanity-Googling duty.  That and they look for anyone who calls it the Hoover Institute so that they can correct them.
