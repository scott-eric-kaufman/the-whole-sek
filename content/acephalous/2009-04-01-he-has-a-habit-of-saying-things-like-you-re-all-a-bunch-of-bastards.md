## He has a habit of saying things like “You’re all a bunch of bastards!”

Conservatives are upset at the classless behavior of the Obamas when
they met with the Queen and Prince Philip today, and I must say, they
have a point. An iPod loaded with show tunes and the footage she
requested of her 2007 visit to the States? _Show tunes_? Even
if they matched the ones in the signed Rodgers and Hammerstein
songbook, and even if that songbook would be rare given that Rodgers
died in 1979, the Queen is a cultural icon of taste and sophistication.
She would never stoop to listening to, much less having songs from
hackneyed musicals [performed during some sort of formal summit](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E6D6143EF936A15752C1A9629C8B63). Outrageous . . . but not the worst of the Obamateurisms the world witnessed today:

He is a complete idiot, but OMG did you see Michelle’s arms?

She’s actually quite petit and feminine, for a sasquatch.

At least Lady MacBeth had the decency to cover up those ham-slabs
she calls arms when going to meet the Queen. Too bad it looked like a
cat spit up on her head, though.

Michelle is a monster, the Isle of Man could fit under that tent!

She walks like a baboon. And she’s obviously packing on the pounds.

MSM, stop comparing MO with Jackie Kennedy. It makes you look silly. Jackie was about as big around as one of MO’s thighs. 

Horrible outfit on our First Wookie.

As my British mother-in-law would say, “What common people.”

Set aside, for the moment, the fact that the people who bemoan the
Obamas’ ostensible classlessness mock his wife with all the maturity of
[the kids who mistakenly thought they ran with the popular crowd](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/03/im-moving-to-the-country.html),
because I’ve not yet revealed the most horrifying Obamateurism of the
day. It seems the fairer Obama may have slighted Prince Philip in some
small manner of decorum. Under normal circumstances, that would not
have been alright, but . . . 

They started wars over less in history.

They have! And to have slighted, of all people, _Prince Philip_, why I’m almost embarrassed to call Obama my Presi—wait, that wouldn’t be acclaimed the [dontopedalogist](http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/citations/dontopedalogy\_1/) would it? _Really_? _Give me a fuc_—on second thought, take it away Eddie:

Oddly enough, you've left off any link to the actual events of yesterday, or the conservative complaints about it. Not that I mind a bit of Izzard after midnight -- that was lovely -- but my usual diplomatic news sources just don't seem to have covered the tea-and-crumpet side of the event.

The thing that struck me was the munchkin proportions of my nation's Head of State compared to US-Pres. and Mrs US-Pres.  Dwarfs rule us.  What can I tell you?

I didn't include links on purpose.  All the comments are from Malkin and Hot Air, but I didn't want risk the automatic trackback.  

And Adam, it's not her fault: old people shrink on the other side of the pond, too, don't they?

I don't know if I have the stomach to go rooting around at Malkin's place; I _do_ know that I don't have the stomach for Hot Air. I'll take your word for it.

The pictures reminded me of the famous [MacArthur and Hirohito](http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%!A(MISSING)en-US%!A(MISSING)official&hs=pFP&um=1&sa=1&q=macarthur+hirohito+photo&btnG=Search+Images) meeting. Because of the size differential and monarchy involved, not because we're an occupying power in Great Britain. I'm behind on my Jewish Conspiracy newsletters, though, that may have changed.

I've [found](http://mediamatters.org/items/200904020002?f=h\_latest) [other](http://mediamatters.org/countyfair/200904020021?show=1) [sources](http://mediamatters.org/countyfair/200904020006?show=1) which get at some of these.... Still not sure what the Prince has to do with it, but I'm sure it'll percolate out in time.

Did they fire all of the protocol officers or something?  Is Obama not reading the briefing books?  Is there no one at the State Department who could weigh in with some welcome advice?

Listen, whether the criticism is fair or not, and there is something delicious about Media Matters complaining about a "double standard", Obama was elected on the basis of Change, i.e., that we wouldn't be doing all that stupid stuff anymore.
