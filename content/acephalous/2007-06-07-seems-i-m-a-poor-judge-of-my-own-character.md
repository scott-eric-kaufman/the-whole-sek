## Seems I'm a Poor Judge of my own Character

Not only is the London chapter _not_ by leaps and bounds the worst thing I've ever written, with a mere two days of revision it will be ready to send to prestigious journals.\*

\*I know what those of you who know my adviser will think me a liar and a fraud, but I neither kid nor defraud you.  I wrote something which not only (almost) met his standards the first time through, but something he believes journals would be insane not to publish.  And to think a mere three weeks ago he and I were discussing the schlock I would no doubt produce working at this unhealthy pace.  Less ruminating, more writing may be the best course of action from here on out.  (Or not.)

That's right, no more overthinking ---- we're gonna print out a big Nike swoosh and the motto "Just Do It" over your desk.

You'll be working so hard you won't even have time to notice your parallels with their Chinese sweatshop laborers.

Seriously, don't even revise it.  Whatever you do, the reviewer is going to want you to make changes.  Just get it out!  Then the next chapter, and the next, you maniac!

_Then the next chapter, and the next, you maniac!_

Here's a question: does publishing many chapters (or portions of chapters) from one's diss hurt the chances of getting a book? I remember hearing that publishers might shy away from publishing a book most of whose contents had already appeared elsewhere.
