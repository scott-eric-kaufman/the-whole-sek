How do conservatives reconcile their cultural tastes with their partisan politics? I don’t mean _generally_, because _generally_ the answer is they don’t think about their media consumption any more than your average liberal. I mean _specifically_, that is, when they do consider how the media they consume intersects with the beliefs they profess, what happens? Thanks to [_Andrew Breitbart_](),
we now have a daily glut of valuable insight into what it is to be a
conservative for whom music, literature and film don’t nadir after
Beethoven, Shakespeare and Bogart. Admittedly, some of the revelations
are old hat, as with [Breitbart’s confession](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/abreitbart/2009/01/11/my-first-assignment-gone-baby-gone/) of how certain conservatives really feel about the working poor:

Whoever cast the Boston grotesques that littered the
film, my hat’s off to you. These profoundly ugly people really created
a backdrop that made you want to root for the kid not to be found and
brought back to her natural origins.

But most of _Big Hollywood_ is so awesomely counter-intuitive
Walter Benn Michaels wouldn’t touch it with your ten-foot pole. Exhibit
A: Evan Sayet’s post on [Bruce Springsteen’s secret conservatism](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/esayet/2009/01/09/bruce-springsteen-one-hundred-percent-republican/), in which he claims

that, while Springsteen the multimillionaire, rock star
with the mansion in Beverly Hills may be a Liberal, Bruce Springsteen
the poet is one-hundred percent Republican.

Those of you currently reading Dante in your sophomore English
classes take note: Sayet someone out. Not that I need to tell you this,
but the _Commedia_ is written by Dante the Man about Dante the Pilgrim _as narrated by Dante the Poet_. The Poet is the fiction’s conceit—the character who remembers and recalls what happened after he found himself _per una selva oscura_—and
is not to be treated coextensive with Dante the Man. I invoke Dante
here because Springsteen, like Dante, is frequently confused for his
narrators by people who should know better. No one reads “[Caliban upon Setebos](http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/267.html)”
and mistakes the theological musings of Prospero’s deformed manservant
for a definitive statement of Browning’s philosophy; whereas with
Springsteen, every word his narrators utter is an expression of his
personal beliefs _even when_ he opens with a lyric like “[[m]y name is Joe Roberts](http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/HighwayPatrolman.html).”

By these lights, Springsteen the Poet is a conservative because Joe
Roberts believes a “man [who] turns his back on his family, well, he
just ain’t no good.” As that belief plugs neatly into the fallacy
whereby family values are conservative values are Republican values,
Springsteen the Poet would’ve been besotted by Sarah Palin and voting
for John McCain. If that sounds simple-minded, you likely won’t be
impressed by Sayet’s Sowell-lite philosophizing: liberals believe “man
is born good and then corrupted by the institutions of society,”
whereas conservatives believe “man is born with a dual and conflicting
nature—capable of good and evil and everything in between—requiring
cultural forces to help him tamp down the darker side and cultivate the
good within.” By these druthers, any song in which options are weighed
lilts conservative; any song that narrates the selection of the correct
option must, therefore, be the product of a conservative mindset. A
song like “Imagine” is liberal because if there are no countries and no
religions there is nothing to kill or die for—that is, without some
system of belief around to adjudicate the merits of a decision, no
choice is any more or less meaningful than any other. Do what _feels_ right replaces do what _is_ right, and since doing wrong feels so right why don’t we do it in the road? To Sayet’s mind, 

Springsteen . . . holds the diametrically opposed—Conservative—vision of man’s nature:

Two faces have I.  

One that laughs, one that cries.  

One says “hello,” one says “goodbye.”  

One says things I don’t understand.  

Makes me feel like half a man.

Since Springsteen recognizes that his feelings are conflicted, far
from seeking the destruction of the civilizing forces, these are the
things he specifically turns to for guidance:

At night I get down on my knees and pray  

I want to make that other man go away.


Couple of points to make here: first, Springsteen is a recovering Catholic; second, _Springsteen is a recovering Catholic_. Has Sayet never met a recovering Catholic before? Because _Tunnel of Love_ may be the quintessential statement of recovering Catholicism in the latter half of the last century. Just ask [Walker Percy](http://books.google.com/books?id=Z83RmRyZ63kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%!i(MISSING)t+ain%!t(MISSING)+no+sin+to+be+glad+you%!r(MISSING)e+alive%!&(MISSING)ei=coxrSeGjGYrUkwSZpPGBDg&client=firefox-a#PPA189,M1). Pick as many cherries as you like—and Sayet _loves_ cherries—you cannot turn Springsteen into an organization man:

Fairly early in Springsteen’s career, in the song “[Badlands](http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/Badlands.html),”
the Conservative poet takes a moment to contemplate what will bring him
happiness in life. He then runs through the usual possibilities, from
losing oneself in his work to the accruing of fabulous riches, only to
decide in the end that is “Faith that can save me.”

Strangely, Sayet fails to quote the song’s most famous lyric:

For the ones who had a notion,  

A notion deep inside.  

That it ain’t no sin  

To be glad you’re alive . . .

Except, were Springsteen the Catholic Sayet wants him to be, _it would be_.
Catholic’s have this funny idea about babies and the taint of sin—life
is a journey, see, from sin to salvation, and this journey starts the
moment you find yourself in _una selva oscura_ . . . but I’m
not here to quibble about Catholic doctrine. I concede that
Springsteen’s thought was shaped by his Catholic upbringing. I’ll even
concede that the confessional _métier_ imparted by a Catholic
upbringing makes for some fine art. However, I steadfastly insist that
writing songs in which your narrator feels conflicted does not a
conservative make. Misunderstanding fairly straightforward lyrics,
hower . . . 

Springsteen sees the constraints of the Constitution as good, right and essential:

See that flag flying over the courthouse?  

It says certain things are set in stone.  

Who we are, what we’ll do and what we won’t.

The combination of Catholic imagery and American iconography stand
in stark contrast to the Neo-Liberal Lennon whose Utopian dreams
require the dismantling of these things—of all codes and creeds beyond
doing what feels good at any moment


Sayet correctly identifies Springsteen’s reverance for classical American iconography, but he misses _the entire point of the song_.
Those words are not spoken by the narrator—they don’t even appear in
the song, actually, but I’m not here to nitpick about misquotation—they
are spoken _to_ the narrator _by_ his father. In “[Long Walk Home](http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/LongWalkHome.html),”
Springsteen’s narrator returns to the town where he was born and finds
it in disrepair. The local grocery and barbarshop are still there, but
they’re manned and patonized by “rank strangers.” The diner is dust.
The veteran’s hall stands “silent and alone.” _Then_ the narrator recalls what his father told him: 

My father said,  

“Son, we’re lucky in this town.  

It’s a beautiful place to be born.  

It just wraps its arms around you,  

Nobody crowds you, nobody goes it alone.  

You know that flag flying over the courthouse?  

Means certain things are set in stone.  

Who we are, what we’ll do and what we won’t.”

You don’t need my crack skills as a professional interpreter of
words to recognize what Springsteen is up to here: the town through
which the narrator currently walks, with its shuttered businesses and
lonely veterans, resembles the town his father described in name alone.
Via a simple grammatical exercise, this point can be made abundantly
clear. Since the father’s statements were made in the past, I will put
them in the past tense:

My father said,  

“Son, we **were** lucky in this town.  

It **was** a beautiful place to be born.  

It just **wrapped** its arms around you,  

Nobody **crowded** you, nobody **went** it alone.  

You know that flag flying over the courthouse?  

**Meant** certain things **were** set in stone.  

Who we **were**, what we **would’ve done** and what we **wouldn’t have done**.”

The last line clunks something awful, but the point should be clear:
he doesn’t believe in the permanence of community or the continuity of
shared cultural values. The song documents how fragile the order his
father cherished actually was. The narrator wouldn’t return to his
hometown and note that “it’s gonna be a long walk home” if “home”
possessed the timeless virtues Sayet attributes to it. What we have
here, then, is a succinct example of the conservative break from
reality:

A town falls to shit. 

A person notes that the town fell to shit and remembers what his father told him the town was like. 

A conservative comes along, examines the town, declares the father correct and attributes the sentiment to the son. 

“You and me, Bruce,” the conservative tells the son. “We’re alike.”

“I’m not Bruce.”

“Yes, you are.”

“No, I’m not.”

“Whatever. All that matters is you’re really just like me.”

“I don’t think what you think I think,” he replies.

“But you just—you just now said—you talked about how wonderful your hometown is.”

“Was.”

“Wrong! I was listening. You spoke in the present tense.”

“I _remembered_ in the present tense.”

“You _remembered_ how great this town is.”

“Was.”

“IS!”

“Was.”

“IS IS IS!”

“Was.”

“IS IS IS INFINITY NO TAKE BACKS!”

Are you, perhaps, saying that conservative cultural consumption, like conservative journalism, has biases and filters that oversimplify and alter reality to the point where it is unrecognizable to the rest of us? 

Or are you just having fun? I know I am!

I like to think that a 'barbarshop' is where the king of the elephants goes to get a nice short-on-the-sides-but-leave-it-long-on-top.

Obviously I have nothing non-inane to contribute tonight!

Acephalous (a man without a head) talks about another man who's talking about art and Bruce Springsteen.  I think the message is that people who talk about politics should be careful about talking about art.  Because if you talk about art then a man whose job it is to interpret art will make you sad.  That is because he will say you are doing it wrong.  

Is my reading comprehension an A?

Justin -

Say rather that Headless is talking about Bruce Springsteen et al. in order to make a point about another man talking about bullshit (i.e. politics).

Also say: 'AND YOU! Friendless. Brainless. Helpless. HEADLESS!! Do you want me to send you back to where you were? Unemployed, in Irvine?'

Thank you for taking the time to read my piece on Springsteen.  While I don't quite grasp your analysis -- how does being GLAD you're alive have anything to do with "original sin?" -- I enjoyed your writing.  

Further, even if it was the fatther speaking in the past tense -- an odd call since he's speaking in the PRESENT tense -- the point remains that what is set in stone is set in stone whether times are good or bad and that it is the failure of the Neo-liberal generation to have ANYTHING set in stone (except that if it FEELS good, do it) that has brought on society's decline.  It's the Greatest Generation talking to the Me  Generation and,  yes, it's a long walk home to the America of values and beliefs.

This so completely reminds me of 9/11, when the DJs in my (very small, very rural, quite conservative) area all started playing "Born in the USA" nonstop. And I wanted to say, people, have you even LISTENED to the lyrics??

I really think that all cultural consumption and media consumption has "biases and filters" that alter reality in ways that the adherants understand and the detractors are unable to recognize. And I would think that there are more than just two of these, not merely one being liberal and the other conservative. Neither group is as monolithic as its critics suggest, but the respective stereotypes are interesting to invoke and watch the screams arise from the targeted group. 

Except that's not getting to be much fun anymore, if it ever was. 

It appears to be the yin and yang of consumption. Want a totally objective person? They don't exist. Except maybe in their own mind.
