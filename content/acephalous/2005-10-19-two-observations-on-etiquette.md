## Two Observations on Etiquette

1.  When people who are my Baby Sister (21 years old but still forever Baby) call to tell me that they're putting my beloved dog down tomorrow, they must include all relevent qualifiers, foremost among them "may," "if this medicine fails," "to treat a common ailment," and "is ninety-percent effective."  Because Baby Sister, minus those qualifiers my mind tends morbid.
2.  If you're from Baton Rouge, reached here by Googling my name and spent over an hour and a half reading through everything I've written in the past seven months, comment on something or send me an email.  You must be someone who knows me and wants to know what I've been up to .... which means you must be one of the four people who mattered in high school.  We should catch up.  Shoot the shit.  I can tell you about my rise to these dazzling heights.  You can tell me about the eleven kids you bore über-stud [Lance Mayeux](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/stats/1997/players/passing/28253.html) and we can have entertaining conversations about all the people you didn't sleep with while we were dating.  We can discuss what it means to be passive-aggressive and how entertaining we find such cold cruel displays.  Or maybe you're that unfortunate soul who thought people would respect him if he brought a briefcase to class.  If you are, well then, we should catch up!  You're the reason I only returned home a bloody pulp twice a week.  I _owe_ you recompense.

I hope everything goes well with your dog's treatment. I send him or her my love. I recently had to put my beloved dog of ten years to sleep, and I'm about to break down just reading about the possibility here. 

You're from Baton Rouge? My girlfriend is from Baton Rouge as well. Judging from your post, you may have known each other.

Eek.  Good luck with the dog thing.  Almost had to make that decision last week myself.  "minds tend morbid" indeed.

Kevin, if she's anywhere in the vicinity of 28, I may very well have known her.  There was such a limited circle of reasonably cool people in high school that most of "us" knew or knew of each other.

Adam, thanks for the kind words.  I read about Thunder last week, and I'm deeply sorry for your loss.
