## I Don't Love You Anymore

More [borderline intelligent responses](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/writer\_in\_chief\_a\_bleg/#775) by Y.T. over at the Valve.  You know, in case you're interested in, say, how I conflate Hesse's _[The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel]()_ (and that is, in fact, it's title in English, so hush for a moment)  and my chosen profession in a [response](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/writer\_in\_chief\_a\_bleg/#778) to [Jonathan Goodwin](http://jgoodwin.net/) which, to my great shame,  acknowledges the fact that he doesn't respect me as much as I respect him.  But whatever, right?  He can, as my grandma would say, "find himself and shit in the ocean."  Amazing how well Tony Robbins-speak corresponds to Yiddish sometimes.  

(The title of this entry refers, obviously, to the fact that I feel I'm neglecting my precious, headless blog every time I post on the Valve.  But it's all a part of the same thought process, baby, I promise.  I still love you, baby.  You know that.)

As I responded over there, I certainly didn't mean that and am not sure why you thought so.

Hey, Cephalous.  I'm hugely grateful for your Valve posts and mean to respond to your latest when the chance arises.  I sympathize.

Jonathan, 

As I explained over there, it had been long, long day of reading awful, awful articles.  I take it back.  My grandmother never would've recommended you go shit in the ocean.  Only immediate family were so lucky.

Sean,

Thanks for the vote of support.  I return the thanks because, as I've mentioned somewhere, maybe here or maybe there, the Valve's become the sort of intellectual environment I'd imagined graduate school would be.
