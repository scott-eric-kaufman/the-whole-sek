Octavia Butler's _[Fledgling](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1583226907/diesekoschmar-20)_ disappoints.  Exuberant popular reviewers must have forgotten the territory she covered in the [Xenogenesis](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0446676101%!F(MISSING)) books.  Only I'm not sure how they would have since she basically rewrote them in _Fledgling._ Not that I want to speak ill of the recently departed . . . or even of _Fledgling_.  Had it been written before the Xenogenesis novels it would've compelled me to read every other word she's written.  Only it wasn't.  I've read that a crippling case of writer's block prevented her from completing the [_Parable_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0446601977%!F(MISSING)) [series](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0446675784%!F(MISSING)).  Reading _Fledgling_ I got the impression that she thought she could hurdle that block by rewriting earlier, better novels.  

Maybe she could've.  We'll never know.  I should say that I don't begrudge her this rewriting.  I do the same thing everyday: I pull up my dissertation and rewrite the last paragraph I'd written so as to reoccupy the headspace in which I had written it.  She thought she could find her gift again by recasting the Oankali as vampires.  The human-Oankali dynamic became the human-vampire dynamic.  The narrator is an African-American woman who is a half-human and half-the-other . . . a hybrid whose hybridity drives the narrative to its inevitable melancholic-but-hopeful conclusion.  To be fair, there are only two sexes in _Fledgling_; but the structural relations of symbiont to alien are identical . . . as are the benefits of that relationship.  

Butler traces the complexity with the same deft hand responsible for the Xenogenesis books _but_ it's the same complexity.  I admired it as much this time as I had the first but the book lacks that spark . . . that moment in which a nebulous everything clicks into place.  Walter Benjamin writes of the night sky suddenly aligning random stars into a collocation of constellations . . . the moment when all the implications are finally tallied and everything makes the sense it should have all along.  _That_ is what _Fledgling_ lacks.  Brilliant, certainly, but familiarly so.  Those stars had already clicked into place.

I had intended this to be a substantial review of _Fledgling._ Only I don't want to spoil what little there is to spoil.  It's the only pleasure you'll take from the book.  Especially when you consider this was supposed to be her priming the pump for the bigger and better things.

Finally, I feel obliged to note that you should wait until the Warner paperback comes out to read _Fledgling_.  I read on [Nalo Hopkinsons' blog](http://nalohopkinson.blogspot.com/) that Butler always published her hardcovers with small presses before turning over the mass market paperbacks to Warner.  If there were some way I could admire her more, this would be it.  _However_ the hardback from Seven Stories Press which arrived last week has already started falling apart.  Chunks of pages have come unstuck from the binding and are threatening to jump.  The spine has already cracked.  _On a hardcover._  I'm not sure how that happened.  I should add that outside of writing in the margins, I take care of my books.  No one initially believes I've read any of them because their spines are pristine.  (Then I let them flip through the pages and marvel at how much I can chicken-scratch I can scribble in the margins.)  This book is just . . . I don't know what to make of it.  It must have been programmed to self-destruct.

_Fledgling_ is not so good, no.  But then again, I've a high resistence to vampire stories, of whatever sort.

But _Parable of the Talents_ may be her best novel, better even than _Xenogenesis_, and that's saying something.  I can't think of a book I was more looking forward to than the final _Parable_ novel.  I mean, I'm quite eagerly anticipating the Wachowiski's _V for Vendetta_, say; but that's not in the class of anticipation.

\*nods\* \_Fledgling\_ is kind of a romp.  I really enjoyed it, but I also recognised that it had a lot of elements familiar from her previous work.  When she came to Toronto during the tour to promote \_Fledgling,\_ she said that she'd become discouraged from seeing the things she wrote about in the two "Parable" books appearing on the news as very distressing reality.  She felt she needed a break before going on to the third "Parable" book, so she wrote something that was fun.  It made me giggle, because Octavia's "fun" is still more meaty than many other authors' "serious" books.

I'd respond, but I feel seriously out-classed here.  Adam and Nalo Hopkinson _both_ commenting on my blog?  Who next, John Crowley?  (Wait a minute . . .)

So now I will respond:

Nalo, you've hit it squarely: it was a "weak" Butler novel, but as it is the last Butler novel, I felt like I willed myself to enjoy it more than I actually did.  Still brilliant--the word "meaty" aptly captures the complexity of the social relations in the novel--but likely not what the next _Parable_ book would've been.  I can't help but second Adam's suggestion that her career had an upward trajectory, and that her best work was still to come.  (They probably heard that sigh in Switzerland.)
