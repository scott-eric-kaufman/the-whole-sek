## Obama Would <em>Not</em> be the First African-American Head of State

Contrary to popular belief, my title is absolutely true.  Were Obama elected President, he would the _second_ person of African-American descent to occupy the highest office of a land.\*  The _first_ would be this guy:

Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt's [great-grandfather was John Hood](http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=5096&date=20061003), "[an elegant vagabond](http://acephalous.typepad.com/johnhood.jpg) with fine manners, a real dandy with a golden bracelet and a distinguished, stately appearance" ... and an African-American.  

Seems Obama's "historic" campaign is not as historic as we were led to believe.  Were he elected President, he would not be the first African-American Head of State, merely the first _American_ African-American Head of State.  (The first African-American _American_ Head of State?  Doesn't matter, Obama's still not special.)

Who said anything about First AAHoS? I've only heard the accurate First AAPoTUS, which is notable, if not remarkable--though given general opinion towards AAs just a few decades ago, perhaps it is remarkable that the country has (largely) come so far.

Hmm, what about all those Liberians who are descended from former American slaves?  Any turn out to be president or prime minister or whatever?

To answer the Scrumptious question: yes.  From it's founding in 1847 until Samuel Doe took power in 1980, all of Liberia's president were Americo-Liberians.  Doe in turn was ousted by Charles Taylor, who was of mixed Gola and Americo-Liberian descent.  The country's current president, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, Africa's first elected female head of state, is not Americo-Liberian herself, but her family has been closely connected to the Americo-Liberian establishment and she earlier served in the administration of President William Tolbert, who Doe had killed.

So, really, elegant vagabonds aside, Sweden's got nothing.

Descended from African-Americans isn't the same as African-American, unless you want to create some sort of weird American-nationalist corollary to the old one-drop-of-black-blood rule.  Still, a couple of the early Liberian presidents would probably qualify.  Beyond that, the Swedish prime minister only questionably occupies the "highest office of a land," and he's definitely not the head of state.  Sweden's king is the head of state and might be considered to hold the highest office.

Well, Obama wouldn't even be the first African-American President of the US.  He is of immigrant African heritage, not black American heritage.  For some people, that's a big difference.

Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, Harding, and Coolidge all arguably have "one drop" too.  (See J.A. Rogers, \*Five Negro Presidents\*, referenced comically in Reed's \*Mumbo Jumbo\*.)

And anyway, Bill Clinton is still the first black president.  So, if Sen. Clinton wins the election. he'd more importantly become the first black First Lady.

I propose "First Gentleman" for the office that Bill Clinton now aspires to hold.

Guys, guys, if Sen. Clinton wins, Bill will become "First Sexual Harasser."  And Gloria Steinem will find a way to make that a really good thing.  And Andrea Dworkin's head will explode.

(Luther, read the footnote!) 

And yes, I knew this wasn't the case -- hence, the footnote, plus, you know, common sense about the history of race in America -- it's just I was watching Foxnews and they wouldn't shut up about white voters being unable to vote for an African-American, _not even one who was half-white_, so I took a moment to _reflectio ad absurdum_.

I really hope Dworkin's head doesn't explode. I was looking forward to seeing her again during the coming Zombie Apocalypse, and an exploded head would surely crush that hope.

"Well, Obama wouldn't even be the first African-American President of the US. He is of immigrant African heritage, not black American heritage. For some people, that's a big difference."

But strictly speaking, doesn't that still make him an African American?

Of course, the Prime Minister of Sweden is merely head of government, not head of state.  King Carl XVI Gustaf is not, I think, an African-American.

This being said, Queen Silvia of Sweden is half-German, half-Brazilian, so it would seem likely that her daughter, and the next Swedish head of state, Crown Princess Victoria, might have some Afro-Brazilian ancestry, although wikipedia says Queen Silvia's mother was of "Portuguese and Spanish descent."

Vincente Guerrero was half black, half Indian, elected Presidente of Mexico in 1829.

Please explain how you can be an American Africa-American. I've heard of Americans, and I have heard of African-Americans ( PC for black americans), but I have never heard of American African Americans.
