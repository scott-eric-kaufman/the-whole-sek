From Silas Weir Mitchell's letter to Mrs. A.G. Mason (5 June 1911):
[[Stonewall Jackson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall\_Jackson)] had at one time the insane belief that his right leg was hollow and made of glass, and that everything he ate went into it.

Ah, so _that's_ where the whole "hollow leg" thing came from.  Glad the "glass" part was dropped, though, because that there's crazy talk.
