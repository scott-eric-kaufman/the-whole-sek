The best sentence from the chapter I stupidly sent people this morning:
_His 
novels are therefore both nostalgic and utopian, morality plays describing how 
would have become Americans who they are if they had been who they are at the 
time of the Revolutionary or Civil Wars._

See what happens when panics creeps into the night?  In the shrill light of day, I recognize some of the basic errors I made.  (For example, the introduction should appear earlier, _maybe_ even in the first ten pages.)  That said, I appreciate all the feedback—past, present and future—as it clarifies in hours what might otherwise take days.

Oh, I don't know, Scott -- the sentence is almost utopian in its vision of English unshackled from the rules of syntax.  Think of it as revolutionary, a form following content kind of thing (wink).  (More soon.)

None of the rest of us EVER write such sloppy panicked prose in the interests of actually finishing a project before we die. 

None of us.

Scott, just tell them you were fragmenting discourse in the interest of showing how the Real erupts through all totalizing structures.  Then buy yourself a pina colada and enjoy having finished a chapter draft.
