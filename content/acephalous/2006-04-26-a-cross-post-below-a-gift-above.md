## A Cross-Post Below, a Gift Above

Tonight I confess my love for Matthew Sweet.  [_Girlfriend_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000098J/diesekoschmar-20) in particular.  But his "Devil with the Green Eyes," off [_Altered Beast_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000000990/diesekoschmar-20), may be my favorite song.  Unfortunately, technical difficulties prevent me from sharing anything.  So instead I'll let Holbo share by proxy.  Last weekend, he introduced me to an album almost too indulgent to believe.  Sweet teamed with Susanna Hoffs—yes, _that_ Susanna Hoffs—on [_Under the Covers_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000EQ5QFE/diesekoschmar-20), an album worth its weight in warm fuzzy nostalgia.  Hoffs' voice is as evocative now as it was when she hieroglyphed 'cross the screen twice daily on _[Nick Rocks!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick\_Rocks)_ 

I know you're dying for a [couple](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/files/12\_care\_of\_cell\_44.mp3) of [samples](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/files/08\_different\_drum.mp3).  [Too bad!](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/files/02\_and\_your\_bird\_can\_sing.mp3)  You'll have to live with three of the worst songs on the album.  Please, do not purchase the album and hear the rest of the songs, all of which are better than those three.  (Although, good or no, the nostalgia's almost overwhelming enough to render those satisfying.  They aren't.  You _crave_ the rest.)

[_Edit: No more gifts!  I've overshot my bandwidth allotment and . . . suspect TypePad may be unhappy about that._]

[_What follows is a version of my initial response to the Spivak event.  It seemed inappropriate earlier.  I lacked the time to edit my complaints constructively last week, and still do.  But I post them nonetheless, if only to deflate some preposterous claims forwarded elsewhere.  I hide it all below the fold since it likely bores the lot of you.  That said, it contains many pretty pictures, which we can discuss in isolation from the silly words which surround them.  This will, however, be my final word on the matter._]

**Caravaggio, "Doubting Thomas"**

**Mark Tansey, "Doubting Thomas"**

As I read Spivak's "Scattered Speculation," I thought it strange that this text was forwarded as a counter-example.  How could it not be considered highly eclectic?  In tone and diction; in the allusive style of its argument; in its constant quotations from the traditional roster thinkers associated with what I'd call Theory, I could hardly think of a more illustrative example of the form.  I was baffled.  So I devised some scenarios.  

What some thought would happen:

As everyone surrounded the figure they believed Jesus reanimate, I required solid evidence.  I would have to pluck the wound.  Once done, the other apostles would be proven correct.  Our faith would become fact.  Spivak would not be an example of Higher Eclecticism once I engaged her work seriously.

What actually happened:

As I stood in the middle road, I could not believe that ground had opened beneath our wheels.  I had been a passenger, brought to this fissure by another, and she seemed unconcerned.  Unbelieving.  She stared at me, hand on shifter, oblivious to the altered rock face behind her.  She would never believe what had happened.  She would insist that Spivak was not an example of Higher Eclecticism despite abundant geological evidence to the contrary.

In truth, she would floor the accelerator and [wax triumphant](http://www.long-sunday.net/long\_sunday/2006/04/assessing\_the\_d.html) when she reached her destination.  "Could you imagine such idiocy?" she would say, sip her drink, then add "He's probably still out there trying to convince people of the existence of tectonic events."  She would not be incorrect.  I _would_ be out there.  Perhaps some friends and I would wander interstates, [pulling over on occasion to open our eyes](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374518734/diesekoschmar-20):

As we could plainly see from the interstate, the rock now residing in that striped mountainside had once been brutally shoved around—shoved, not pulled, and with such force that a large part of it had been tipped up more than ninety degrees, to and well beyond the vertical.  Overturned.  Such violence can happen on an epic scale.  There is an entire nation in Europe that is upside down.

Because what is plainly there requires no faith, only observation.  More importantly, it never requires the faith I'll never have.  Witness the limited, canonical field of theorists Spivak cited: Althusser, Benjamin, Deleuze, de Man, Derrida, Freud, Habermas (but only to dismiss), Jameson, Lacan, La Capra, Lyotard, Marx, Negri, Nietzsche, and Saussure.  Were I to have hypothesized that such a representative essay existed, I would have been shouted down, compelled to present evidence of my outrageous claim.  And yet there it is _in an essay chosen to disprove the existence of essays of the very sort it is_.

As to the style of argumentation, I cannot top Spivak herself.  In the midst of a technical if analogical discussion of how Marx's word/reality relates to Saussure's signifier/signified, she notes, parenthetically, that "if this were a technical discussion where it was necessary to respect the specificity of the vocabulary of linguistics, I would not of course, equate word/reality and signifier/signified" (83).   That she notes parenthetically that she will not do precisely what she has just done is bad enough.  That she immediately does it again sends my head spinning: 

It is certainly _of interest_ that, using a necessarily post-monetary notion of Value-in-exchange, which must suggest that "political economy [is]...concerned with a system of equivalence...[between a specific] labor and [a specific] wage," Saussure shows us that, even in the mother tongue, it is the work of difference that rermains originary, that even as it is the most "native," language is always already "foreign," that even in its "incorporeal essense," "the linguistic signifier...[is] constituted not by its material substance but only by the differences that separate its acoustic image from others" (83).

I'll explain why I emphasized the phrase "of interest" momentarily.  For the moment, I merely want to point to the _style_ of argumentation here, one which I think typical of Higher Eclecticism.  The initial disavowal—"if this were a technical discussion where it was necessary to respect the specificity of the vocabulary of linguistics, I would not of course, equate word/reality and signifier/signified"—implies Spivak possesses the ability to deploy, in a sophisticated fashion, the vocabulary of linguistics with technical specificity _while simultaneously unburdening her of the responsibility to do so_.  Which she then does, in the next sentence, now that it allows her to appear to argue her point with more rhetorical force.   I say "appear to argue" because she refuses to own her point.  It is merely a thing "of interest."  

Not that I should be surprised, as earlier in the paragraph she claimed that "Attention to Marx's concept-metaphor of the foreign language is interesting here" (83).  Marx's _actual_ concept is not of interest, the "attention" Spivak will pay to it is.  Some may say that I am paying _too much_ attention to her language and not enough to her argument.  Fair enough.  But the same people will at other times speak to the inviolability of form and content or style and substance.  If it is true in other cases, it must at the very least be considered plausible in this one.  Does the style of her argument alter its content?  Should I not take her at her word when she characterizes her language as "careful" (92)?  

What should I make of the fact that, despite not discussing the objects of literary criticism, she continually refers back to what other "literary critics" or "literary academics" think about these issues?  Should I note that the _implied_ audience of "Scattered Speculations" and the _actual_ audience of this event are not only different, but that one half of the latter denies that any such connections exist?  Or that the same half insists that they are bored by considerations of how the audience she addresses, implicitly and explicitly, reacts to her work?  That would mean that evaluations of Spivak's works depended on ignoring the words she writes, the arguments in which she frames them _and_ the horizon of expectations embedded in both.  

To claim that a higher eclecticism is not present in this text denudes it of meaning.  The only option is, as Jon has suggested, to find a coherent or tenably incoherent means of defending higher eclecticism.  One cannot continue to deny that it is not a style.  One cannot continue to claim that it is naught but an unthinking dismissal of difficulty disguised as an intellectual complaint.  And one cannot continue to intimate, in the absence of supporting evidence, and in the face of abundant evidence to the contrary, that the dismissal of the thought-_qua_-thought is a crypto-dismissal of a race or a gender or a sexual orientation _by these parties_.  Perhaps others dismiss them on such grounds.  No one participating in this debate has.  No one participating in these debates would even think to.  

All of which is only to say, to return with unplanned poetry to where I began, that, _pace_ Caravaggio and Tansey, I see the future of these discussions thus:

Scott, two points, mainly in so far as your post bears on my role in the past week or two:  

1) I don't see exactly why you think the essay was chosen to "disprove" the Higher Eclecticism.  The essay was chosen, rather, as a common text around which the concept could be explained and debated.  As I noted, in my call for contributions, when I suggested this particular essay above all, it actually would seem rather handy for those who wished to advance the thesis of such a "Higher Eclecticism."  In short, then, the point of choosing the text was rather the opposite of what you state.  

(This was not the only reason the text was chosen, of course, but the other reasons have little or nothing to do with "Higher Eclecticism.")

2) Then you say that I personally have "suggested [the project] to find a coherent or tenably incoherent means of defending higher eclecticism."  Not so.  Most of all in that I have still little idea of what "higher eclecticism" is.  Rather, I've proposed a defence of _eclecticism_.  And put forward the beginnings of one in, now, a number of places.  Most recently, I've termed this a "lowdown and dirty" eclecticism.  

Moreover, it should be obvious that, contra the implication of your paragraph that mentions me, I have at no point thought to defend (coherently or otherwise) "an unthinking dismissal of difficulty disguised as an intellectual complaint."

Stephen, you've been mistaken for another Stephen.  So much so, I actually emailed that other Stephen.  Your sarcasm has been buried by your lack of titular precision.  It happens to us all some times.

Sean, thanks.  (OtherStephen, Sean may have mistaken you for the other Stephen too.)  

Walt, you're obviously not a child of either pop of the late '80s or indie rock of the early '90s.  Otherwise you'd be feeling the power of nostalgia.  Or were you talking about my critique of Spivak, in which case I can only ask, "What do they play on your elevators?"  (And when, since I'd like to avoid HIB and KH when they do.)

Scott, the first comment was mine.  The second response to Sean was not and should probably be deleted.  You have a particularly nasty troll impersonating other commenters.

I have an underhanded troll, too, since he uses the same IP address for the "Stephen" above the "Walt."  Who do I know who would impersonate two of my closest friends on my blog?  And why?  Someone want to start trouble, maybe?
