In lieu of memorializing Roger Ebert myself, I thought I'd instead 
collect comments about his death that would've made him smile. Like [this one](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2013/04/04/ebert-common-man-reviews#comment-854597645):

Ironic that he had a "gift"( his job as a 
movie-goer/critic"....would  that not be a fun job????!!!)...then 
started bashing those who had a  different "thought than his". He 
continued to bash while he was silenced  with cancer......some people 
never "get it"...never "shut up"...never  focus on The Lesson.

Had I been given the "gift" of such an insipid job (which made  
millions for him)....I would be grateful. I would not be bashing the  
Country nor the Conservative Founder's philosophy which made it all so  
possible. I would be GRATE-FILLED!!

Had I been given a cancer which would silence me, I would reflect on the purpose of that.

"BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM!".....Psalm 46:10

Suffering...perhaps due to his lack of recognition of the Divine  
Master of OUR Country...and gratitude for his fellow American and the  
RIGHTS given to us by our Creator.

I do not call his stubborn clinging to life as "brave".....what are the options?...limited, at best...

He would've loved someone turning his cancer into signs from an "[UN]GRATE-FILLED" God that he should shut up. [This one too](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2013/04/04/ebert-common-man-reviews#comment-854353831):

In spite of the multitude of naive "film lovers" who 
wouldn't be able  to recognize an effectively entertaining and 
well-crafted film, without  a critic's advice, Ebert's reviews were, for
 the most part, foolish and  off-the-mark.

He was famous [= worthy of respect??] because of his early exposure  
on nationally syndicated AT THE MOVIES TV show. Like "Laugh-In," "Ray  
Harryhausen," "CNN," being first doesn't always make one the best,  
merely famous to the masses who are unaware  of the subject matter.

Every week Siskel would remind the nation the Ebert was an idiot,  
leaving Ebert to stare dumbly with his mouth open. Unfortunate that  
Siskel died first. Fortunate for Ebert. Conspiracy anyone?

To be accused of putting out a hit on Siskel because Gene was the better film critic? He would have treasured that. [This too](http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3004233/replies?c=38):

Ebert’s opinions have produced torture for as long as I 
can remember.  Look on his death as a late term abortion...many years 
too late.

All this unnecessary punctuation to punch the "abortion" line? He would've adored it. [As well as this](http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3004206/replies?c=14):

I will NOT have ANYTHING good to say about him for Him, 
His “Industry”  and the “Industry” that he reported on accelerated the 
ROT of our  once-GREAT Country. He will stand before the “Great White 
Throne” to  give an account of his life and receive JUDGEMENT!

They say a person's life can be judged by the enemies he's made. As [a pristine able-bodied specimen in perfect health](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/04/a-tale-of-two-classes/comment-page-1#comment-499231),
 I don't know what it's like to face death, but if ever the day comes 
that I must, I only hope to be remembered so ungraciously by illiterate 
Christian bigots sporting tongues impervious to teeth.

Because I'd like to know that I led a life worth living and, as Ebert's enemies make it abundantly clear, he did just that.
