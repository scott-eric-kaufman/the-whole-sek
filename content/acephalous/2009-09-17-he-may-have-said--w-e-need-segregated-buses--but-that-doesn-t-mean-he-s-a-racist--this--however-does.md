For purely
academic reasons, I’ve never understood the argument that we should
ignore Rush Limbaugh because he’s simply an entertainer who says
outrageous things that millions of people are merely entertained by.  I
didn’t read the complete works of Silas Weir Mitchell because they were
_good_—they are almost uniformly awful—I read them because they were _popular_. 
I was interested not in the content of his thought—it is almost
uniformly mediocre—but in why his contemporaries found it so wildly
appealing.  If you want to learn which ideas and ideologies literate
Americans in 1900 found comforting, you do not consult Henry James: you
turn to the inartistic novels that parroted their prejudices back to
them in a language they already understood.  So when people say that we
should dismiss Limbaugh on the grounds that he only says outrageous
things to sell his product, I’m never quite sure why they’re more
concerned with Limbaugh’s motivations than the fact that millions of
Americans are buying what he’s selling.

Ignoring whatever millions of Americans are buying distorts your
understanding of the American political scene whether it be 2009 or
1909.  If you work on popular culture in 1909, you are limited to
tracking the flight of a given idea—but if you track a given idea in 2009,
your work can actually change its trajectory.  You might not know
exactly where exactly that idea will land yet, but you can do the
political calculus required to figure out where it came from and where
it’s likely to strike.   If it feels like you’re tilting window fans at
cannon balls from half a continent away, remember what they say about
rare Chinese butterflies flapping their wings: they are less likely to
be minuten-pinned by mad lepidopterists—which is beside the point.  The
point, as [one prominent Beatles apologist](http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/also/) recently argued, is that [cultural studies can be an important fan](http://chronicle.com/article/Whats-the-Matter-With/48334/) so long as we aim it at the right cannonball.

In this case, the important issue is not that Limbaugh is a racist
who makes racist statements, but that those statements resonate with
his audience so powerfully. Consider, for example, that he feels no
compulsion to qualify [his sarcastic call for segregated busing](http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site\_091509/content/01125106.guest.html):

**RUSH:** Well, did he say why, in Obama’s
America, that incident with the white kid getting beat up on the black
school bus was not racially motivated?

**CALLER:** I didn’t hear him comment about that. No, sir.

**RUSH:** Because we’ve seen the videotape. Have you seen the videotape?

**CALLER:** Sure.

**RUSH:** We can’t hear what’s being said.

**CALLER:** No.

**RUSH:** So we don’t know what obvious taunts this lone white student was dishing out to the whole bus.

**CALLER:** Right.

**RUSH:** We don’t know what obvious taunts.

**CALLER:** Right.

**RUSH:** Worse than the obvious verbal taunts, we all know the racism that was in the kid’s mind. I mean _Newsweek_
magazine says he was born a racist. So you know the white kid is
sitting there thinking N-word and all kinds of things being surrounded
by these black students. They knew that. They knew that and so they
just descended on the kid and beat him up. We’ve seen the videotape.
What did the police chief investigate?

**CALLER:** He did not comment on anything other than he said more investigations shows that it was not racially motivated.

**RUSH:** I think the guy is wrong I think not only was it racism, it’s justifiable racism.

**CALLER:** True.

**RUSH:** I mean, that’s the lesson that we’re being taught here today. Kid shouldn’t have been on the bus anyway.

**CALLER:** Right.

**RUSH:** We need segregated buses. It was invading of space and so forth. This is Obama’s America.

**CALLER:** Yes. Could I ask another question, not related to this issue?

**RUSH:** By all means, since you’re here.

Most of [the](http://mediamatters.org/limbaughwire/2009/09/15#0023) [liberal](http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/you-dont-say-by-digby-rod-dreher-opens.html) [outrage](http://www.salon.com/politics/war\_room/2009/09/17/bus\_rush/) at his remarks strip them of their relevant context: the _Newsweek_ article “[See Baby Discriminate](http://www.newsweek.com/id/214989)”
that claims, by Limbaugh’s reckoning, that white people are born
racist.  Given that all white people are racists, he argues, the silent
tape didn’t capture the racist epithets the white kid shouted that
make his beating justifiable—because it’s not racist to beat down
someone who’s being a racist—and that it would be best to segregate
similarly racist white kids before they provoke their non-racist black
peers into beating them down.  He and his defenders will read those
expressions of liberal outrage, note that they decontextualize his
sarcastic remarks, and dismiss as stupid anyone who believes Limbaugh
actually called for the return of Jim Crow.

Punishing the straw-Limbaugh not only provides him plausible
deniability, it obscures the actual, non-sarcastic racist assumptions
underpinning his remarks—foremost among them, that black people are
inherently violent and lack self-control.  They are justified, he
unwittingly argues, in expressing their violent tendencies because the
white kid in his hypothetical said something racist. Instead of talking
with their mouths like hypothetical white kid, black kids speak with
their fists, an idea that is so firmly entrenched in the minds of those
who [loudly claim to not be racist](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/proving-the-point-i-made-about-him-being-along-the-lines-of-a-rank-bigot-.html) that _even when black kids are talking with their mouths_, they are “[technically _thugs_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/language-is-revealing-that-dan-riehl-is-a-racist.html)”
forever on the brink of expressing their innate violent tendencies. 
Don’t believe me?  Watch the development of the pronoun “it” in this
bit by Dan Riehl:

It went on but not really to a level that was so loud, or so confrontational that it needed to be addressed.

We just ignored them without much trouble at all.

Yeah, they were technically _thugs_. But the reality was they
were still wannabes really, pretty young, not that big, or many. And if
the several adults there for 9/12 actually needed to do something about
it, the kids wouldn’t have lasted very long. Maybe if they were bigger,
or more numerous, it might have been worse.

That first “it” refers to a conversation that was “not really to a
level that was so loud, or so confrontational that it need to be
addressed.”  But the second one lacks an obvious antecedent and could,
if you’re feeling charitable, refer back to the conversation; more
realistically, “it” refers to the general situation in which young
black kids are quietly saying things in a non-confrontational manner,
and Riehl immediately concludes that that “it” might be a situation that
he and his white companions might need “to do something about.”   Let
me repeat that: Riehl believes that black kids quietly saying things in
a non-confrontational manner is a general situation that, through no
fault of white people, typically escalates to violence.  That third
“it” is even more damning: the general situation in which black kids
quietly say things in a non-confrontational manner “might have been
worse” if they were bigger or there were more of them because, had the
people with innately violent tendencies been larger _or_ more
numerous, Riehl and company would have been powerless “to do something
about it” after the inevitable escalation.  The implication here is
that the physical and numerical superiority of the white adults kept
those black kids in check.  They _wanted_ to beat Riehl down,
but like the President they admire, they are pragmatists who avoid
fights they can’t win—but put a white kid on a bus full of black kids
and what happens?

Riehl answers that question by the simple act of pairing his
experience on 9/12 with the video of the school bus beating; Limbaugh
answers it by unwittingly revealing the beating racist heart within his
sarcastic straw-compatriot; and the commenters at Michelle Malkin and
Gateway Pundit answer it by voicing their belief that it’s no longer
safe to be a white person in America anymore:

[We are seeing a new culture of hate and terror coming from Washington to feed violence](http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/09/calling-al-sharpton-vicious-racist.html#242155).

Limbaugh knows his audience—he’s priming it for the moment when he
needs to justify a preemptive strike against an innately violent party
or parties, and the message is trickling down the airwaves to bloggers
like Riehl and those who read him. It behooves us not to ignore such
developments solely because their provenance is contemporary instead of
historical.

That was different, because then the President was a Republican, and the denounced constituency was, um, it was different then, because, you know, _because_.  Don't make me pull this car over!  I will!

Two words, the elephant in the room you're either ignoring or (to put a charitable light on it) simply missing:

affirmative action

And by ignoring the myriad implications - social and personal - inherent therein in early 21st century America (and some forty years after Montgomery and the National Guard), you miss the whole raison d'tre behind Limbaugh's point. Missed. It. Entirely. And hence, both your pseudo-analysis and argument slides off the road into the Leftist swamp of "racer-ism" (seeing everything as tainted by the "inherent racism of ...well, anyone-you-disagree-with-politically-regardless-of-their-genetically-inherited-melanin-count".

Deep. Real deep.

My impression is that Rush is playing on lefty tropes here.  The left often assumes that white folks do have some latent racism on the verge of erupting on to black folks.  So he's sarcastically suggesting that in this instance, where a white kid is beaten up by black kids, that the white kid must have been a racist, whether or not he said anything inflammatory.  He thinks that in Obama's America, black folk would like buses to be segregated to keep black groups safe from white racism.  It's a silly argument, but it's not racist.

_It's a silly argument, but it's not racist._

Except that his audience knows he's not sincere about justifying the attack: he's mocking the Newsweek argument.

Rather, he's highlighting the "blacks can't help being violent" theme and saying that blacks also must be racist and should be segregated for the safety of white kids.

How is that not fundamentally and blatantly racist?

Davis.BR:  

I don't know if affirmative action qualifies as an "elephant in the room" since liberals will, in fact, talk your ear off about it if you let them.  Also, how does affirmative action relate to the OP?  It is not helpful to assert things like 

"you miss the whole raison d'tre behind Limbaugh's point. Missed. It. Entirely. And hence, both your pseudo-analysis and argument slides off the road into the Leftist swamp of "racer-ism"..." 

without explaining how he missed it, what Rush's point actually was, and so on.

Luther,  

You're getting the trope wrong. The trope, which is not just lefty, but mainstream Sociology, is that we're all (white, black, etc.) racist, because we're raised in a racially divided society with racist tropes suffused through the cultural mix. The left has used this to say that we can't assume that we're the good people who don't have to worry about racial prejudice, and should therefor be open to other folks telling us that we screwed up. The right of course have twisted this into "The left think that all white people are secretly racist." This is then used to both dismiss claims of racism and, ironically, rally white racial identity as some kind of put upon class. (In other words, they want to read Minor Threat's "Guilty of Being White" unironically/context-free). The added problem is that Limbaugh isn't saying any of this, he's "saying" it. ("And now I'm using sarcasm to confess the whole thing!")

SEK, I think that you actually weaken your case by going back to Riehl here, both because you've already said everything worth saying about that post, and because Riehl, not being the kind of prominent figure that Limbaugh or Malkin are, doesn't advance your more interesting argument, that these are influential folks playing to and manipulating a widespread set of fears and prejudices. People get beat up in St. Louis all the time; it's one of the most violent cities in the US. This brouhaha over a lone white kids getting beat up by a group of black kids makes its way around right wing talky town, not because it somehow proves that Obama will actually make everything worse, but because it plays to a more primal set of fears about race and violence, of which the "race war" commenters are only the most colorful examples.

_Two words, the elephant in the room you're either ignoring or (to put a charitable light on it) simply missing: affirmative action_

I'm doing neither, Davis.BR, because your point is completely irrelevant.  I'll tell you what I tell everyone who complains about it: until you 1) learn what legacy admissions are and 2) are outraged by them, I'm not going believe that your opposition to accepting _qualified_ candidates into universities is based on anything other than pure, unbridled racism.  That said:

_And by ignoring the myriad implications - social and personal - inherent therein in early 21st century America (and some forty years after Montgomery and the National Guard), you miss the whole raison d'tre behind Limbaugh's point. Missed. It. Entirely._ 

I _dare_ you to connect the dots between what Limbaugh said, what I said, and what you said.  I can wait.  (Alternatively, what Julian said.)

_I think that you actually weaken your case by going back to Riehl here, both because you've already said everything worth saying about that post, and because Riehl, not being the kind of prominent figure that Limbaugh or Malkin are, doesn't advance your more interesting argument, that these are influential folks playing to and manipulating a widespread set of fears and prejudices._

Riehl's not there as a person of prominence---no matter what he thinks about his traffic, which he seems to think both a lot of and about a lot---but what's been trickled down to.  He's the fiddle being played to the tune of racism, as it were. 

_This brouhaha over a lone white kids getting beat up by a group of black kids makes its way around right wing talky town, not because it somehow proves that Obama will actually make everything worse, but because it plays to a more primal set of fears about race and violence, of which the "race war" commenters are only the most colorful examples._

Absolutely.  The fact that conservatives have even _connected_ it to the President is indicative of their bad faith: they're color-blind, they don't see race, but middle-school kids of different races scuffle and they're all "_This_ is why I protested ObamaCare!"  Not that their opposition to ObamaCare has anything to do with race, mind you---it's merely the first thing that pops in their mind when they hear about a fight in a middle school.
