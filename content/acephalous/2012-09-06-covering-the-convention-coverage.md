## Covering the convention coverage

The consensus on Clinton’s speech last night seems to fall between 
“world-historically awesome” and “the speech by which all future speech 
will be judged and found wanting.” I wouldn’t expect anything less from 
the best Republican President in recent memory. But what’s interesting 
to me isn’t the content of the speech—whatever it was I didn’t watch 
it—but the reaction of conservatives to a successful speech by a 
prominent Democrat. Consider who’s discussing [the two most](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/us/politics/transcript-of-bill-clintons-speech-to-the-democratic-national-convention.html?pagewanted=all) [popular transcripts](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2012/09/05/text-of-bill-clintons-address-to-the-democratic-convention/) according to [memeorandum](http://www.memeorandum.com/):

For your convenience I clicked on all of the possible links to 
conservative blogs or news organizations. Notice something? Either it’s 
taking them a very long time to devise an effective strategy to counter 
Clinton’s rhetoric or they’ve decided that refusing to write about it 
will make it go away. In their defense there’s a good chance they’re 
correct—not because they’ve chosen to ignore it but because conventions 
aren’t important anymore—but I can’t pass up the opportunity to note the
 wonderful irony of watching the party of Manly Men Who Make Money and 
War paralyzed into a panicked silence when confronted by the molehill 
they’ve mistaken for a mountain.
