## Freudian slip?

Sentence from an email I sent a student:

You don’t need to apologize for emailing me two hours
after class about an assignment not due until [much later].  It shows
that you’re on top of things, and professors love stupids who are on
top of things.

I know they’re not homonyms, but, you know—if anyone's looking to unload property under a rock, drop me a line.

That's the revenge Freud exacts on those who reject the validity of his ideas.

I had an incident a couple of years back where I decided to send an email to a student who had been fantastic in class discussion.  I got a bit worried that some of my riffing in response to his comments might have come across as critical, and so decided I should send a quick note just letting him know that his class contributions were very good.  Just as I hit "send", I realised the autofill on the email address had chosen a different "Tom" from the same class - so this compliment was headed on its way to someone who had barely said a word all term...

Figuring it would be fairly obvious to the student what had happened, but would hardly improve things to send a follow-up mail indicating the first one was sent in error, I just left it.  But the next class session, the accidental recipient of my compliment was just /on fire/ - he exploded into the class discussion and continued being a strong presence in discussions for the remainder of the course.

This always makes me feel vaguely guilty I don't mail out random compliments to students on a more regular basis...

It's a good thing that you made the slip with "stupids", because it distracts attention from the much more troubling slip about professors loving students who are on top.

Every quarter around finals time I have to catch myself responding to worried student emails with the words "good lick!"

After moving back here, I've sometimes struggled with Danish spelling. "Noget" = "something". "Nået" = "reached" (as in reaching a goal). I was writing an email to my department head about what I accomplished ("opnået"--i.e., "attained", "reached up to"). Proofreading it, I found I had to change a "reached" ("nået") into a "something" ("noget"). I had written something like "I just thought of reached" instead of "I just thought of something". You know where this is going. When I got to "Hvad jeg har opnået" ("What I have accomplished (or attained)") I thought "aha! another one I have to fix" and wrote the wonderful sentence: "Here's what I have up-something."
