Yeah, I expect that you'll get the last complaint from a Gene Wolfe fan at about the same time as you get the last comment added by a Hello Kitty fan.

Actually, most of the Wolfe fanboys resort to email (likely because they get here through the Wolfe listserv).  As for the Hello Kitty phenomenon, well, I'm not sure what to make of that, but I can't bring myself to delete these joyous outpourings of love to a picture on the internet.  

I always picture a six-year-old whose mother's teaching her how to use the internet:

"What do you want to search for, my love?"

"Hello Kitty!"

"Type it in like this: h-e-l-l-o space k-i-t-t-y.  Now click on 'image.'"

"Mommy!  I see Hello Kitty!  Can I make her bigger?"

"Yes, my darling.  Click right there."

"She's so big, Mommy!  She's so beautiful!  Can I talk to her?"

"Of course.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page.  See that box?  Tell Hello Kitty how much you love her."

(_The child types "hi....hello kitty!!! i love you!!"_)

"Did she hear me, Mommy?  Did she?"

"See [for yourself](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/hello-kittys-ha.html#comment-112569054)."

"She did!  She heard me!  I love her and she heard me!"

I'm not about to break that sweet kid's heart.

The Gene Wolfe fans are so cute, just learning how to write ... and the Hello Kitty fans so eloquent in their appreciation of the artistry of the work they admire ... perhaps they should get together?  In fact, I'll write them a song!  Here, sing this to the tune of Gilbert and Sullivan's "The First Lord's Song":

There once was a guy named Severian  

Who was a torturer and a journey-man  

He had a black mask and really big sword,  

A cape and bare chest, so the fans weren't bored  

He was kind of glum, it's a bit of a pity,  

But that all changed when Severian met Hello Kitty!

She was out frolicing all around a lake  

He first did a double then a triple take  

The cuteness cat with eerie staring eyes  

Would make an unsettling torture device!  

He said "Ancient cat, won't you follow me?"  

And that's how Severian met Hello Kitty!

She cheered him up, and they travelled on  

When his clients met her eyes, their resistance was gone  

She stayed with him through thick and thin  

As they chased around after a MacGuffin  

He thought as who wouldn't that she was so pretty  

And Severian fell in love with Hello Kitty!

They fell into a lovers' bliss  

If you want to know how, you [could read this](http://groups.google.com/group/misc.misc/browse\_thread/thread/b435c47695e8e674/f3b9a90d2134cbb5?lnk=gst&q=faq&rnum=2&fwc=1)  

She bore him a son, and he was so glad  

That the boy [had a mask and cape](http://manolomen.com/2006/08/16/not-so-dark-vader/) just like dad  

They were all a happy family  

When Severian got married to Hello Kitty!

But finally they had to part  

Some outraged fans said that wasn't great art:  

"Gene Wolfe's writing is delirious  

And a torturer in a fetish outfit's serious!"  

She'll always be in his memory  

As Severian sighs over Hello Kitty!

The ones that really disturb me are the ones that call Hello Kitty 'sexy' (and it's not a one-off, I've seen this elsewhere). I wonder how much of it is a language barrier effect... most of the first page of HK worshippers in the thread earlier were obvious non-English-speakers, and perhaps didn't realise that the post was an attempt to calm down a torrid political flamewar: the subsequent pages of worshippers simply didn't look back to previous pages to work out what was going on, and had safety in numbers.

I suppose it would be even more disturbing if someone were to call Severian's I-am-come-as-Death costume sexy... oh, wait. :)
