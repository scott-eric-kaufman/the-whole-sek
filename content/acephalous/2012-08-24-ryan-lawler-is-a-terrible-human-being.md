I gather you know how I feel about the quality of American political 
journalism. But American technology journalism is even worse. Consider 
the case of Ryan Lawler, which is currently being secretly prosecuted by
 Ryan Lawler in the form of [a post he better hope he never finds out he’s written](http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/24/the-lyft-launch-that-coulda-been/).
 It concerns a party held last night in honor of what seems to be as 
laudable as something called “an app” can possibly be: a ride-sharing 
app called [Lyft](http://lyft.me/). What horror befell Lawler at this party?

There was beer and wine and a little bit of food. There 
was cake.  Somebody drove a car with a pink moustache on the front into 
the middle  of the office and some people hopped out and talked about 
their  experiences with users. It was a joyous occasion, a time for 
everyone to  relax and celebrate all the hard work they had been putting
 into it, to  breathe a little, let loose … After the launch party 
concluded, I went to another event, and  blissfully ignored all RSS 
feeds and emails. It was a good night. I got  drunk. I danced a little. I
 went home and passed out.

The horror! Wait—the title of Lawler’s post is “Exclusive: Startup Launch Ruined By Careless Blogger.” Where’s the ruin?

Then, an hour later, someone posted about the event and the upcoming launch, and shit went sideways.

That person must’ve written something really horrible, right, if the “shit went sideways.” What did they write?

I didn’t realize the embargo was broken until about 12 
hours later … I searched Google, found the offending post, and realized 
how late it  was to follow up. It wasn’t like the thing had just been 
published. I  would be following someone else’s story half a day later, 
and no one  wants to do that.

_They just wrote about Lyft before Lawler did_. They weren’t 
supposed to mention it until next Tuesday but they did. Meaning that 
while Lawler “got drunk,” “danced a little,” and “went home and passed 
out,” some other journalist didn’t get drunk, danced very little, and 
went home and filed a story. And because that other journalist did, 
Lawler can’t write about Lyft now. He can’t. Even though

it’s become really popular among the TechCrunch staff. 
Alexia, Josh,  Kim, and I are all users. We all love the service, love 
what these guys  are doing.

He can’t write about it, because someone else _announced the launch before he did_. He loves the service, but someone else wrote about it before he did so now he can’t write about it. He

really wanted to support them and get the word out. 
Sometimes you’re  ambivalent about a startup, and so it’s not a big deal
 to just let that  one go. But this was a product and a team that I 
like. I _want_ them to succeed.

So he really wanted to support a company he loves, one that 
wined-and-dined him a mere twelve hours earlier, but now he can’t 
because someone else wrote about them first. This service that he loves 
must be punished because of someone else’s mistake. The only reason 
Lawler even deigned to write about Lyft despite being beat to the story 
is because he wants our sympathy. _He_ was supposed to break this story. _His_ was
 supposed to be the bland press release that no one really ever bothers 
to read. But now that someone else has written about Lyft, the best he 
can do is write a post so overbrimming with misguided passive-aggression
 that no one should ever take him seriously again.

Note that none of this has anything to do with the quality of the 
journalism. Or the quality of the product for that matter. It’s all 
about the journalistic imperative to yell “FIRST!” on the Internet. And 
do you know what I think of people whose life’s goal is to yell “FIRST!”
 on the Internet? _Especially_ when they claim to be journalists? __ 

I think they’re terrible human beings.

That's pitiful. Funny, in a pathetic way. Infantile, perhaps is the word I'm looking for. 

Wow.
