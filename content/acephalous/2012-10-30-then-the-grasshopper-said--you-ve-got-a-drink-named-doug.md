The person who subtitled _Alias_ is either brilliant or an idiot:

SYDNEY: WHERE IS THE ANECDOTE!

RUSSIAN SPY: THERE IS NO ANECDOTE!

SYDNEY: GIVE US THE ANECDOTE NOW!

RUSSIAN SPY: ALRIGHT! Alright, I'll tell you ...

It's like a spy novel written by old Jews.

Mxyzptlk: I'm going to have to do a follow-up post with all the variations here and on Facebook. Too good not to preserve.

And Ahistoricality: I have no idea who does the CC for Netflix, but I assume it'd be better than live CC work, though Lord knows, the people who do live CC are plenty talented. (I sat in on them doing that when I was in middle school for some BS journalism course, and was impressed by how dedicated and STRESSED OUT these people were.)

You'd expect canned stuff to be done better, but I think they're relying more heavily on automated processes than they used to, and while voice recognition software is getting better.... "You think I asked for a 12-inch _pianist_?"
