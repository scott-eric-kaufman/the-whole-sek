1.  Being sandwiched between two [Crows](http://acephalous.typepad.com/TheCrow.jpg) in the checkout line, observing each surreptitiously scope the other out.
2.  Recognizing how ridiculous both looked. 3.  Realizing each (mistakenly) believed he'd scoped out the other surreptitiously.
4.  Finding that picture of The (Salsa) Crow.
5.  (Also [this one](http://acephalous.typepad.com/TheCrow3.jpg).)
6.  ([This one](http://acephalous.typepad.com/TheCrow2.jpg) too.)
7.  Being inspired to do a Flickr search for "the crow" and finding—check that, words can do no justice: these [must be](http://acephalous.typepad.com/thecrow4.jpg) [seen to be](http://acephalous.typepad.com/thecrow5.jpg) [believed](http://acephalous.typepad.com/thecrow6.jpg).
8.  Remembering I donned Crow-gear for three Halloweens running in high school.

i thought "crow" was a bird of some kind - your post prompted an unnecessary trip to the bookshelf which is bound to kick me out of my morning routine by several seconds which means  i will be semi-jogging to the train again - thanks... here's a dictionary find though (for next Halloween):

crow - (noun) any of several large oscine birds of the genus Corvus, of the family Corvidae, having a long, stout bill, lustrous black plumage, and a wedge-shaped tail, as the common C. brachyrhynchos, of North America. 

PS. i like "lustrous black plumage" phrase - i must incorporate it into a conversation today.
