## Interview with a Candidate for Many Jobs (but Winner of None)

			**SEK:** Thanks for agreeing to this despite it being such a stupid idea.

**ANON:** It's on your blog.  They'll know it's you.

**SEK:** Except I'm not on the market this year.  I'm sure you'll reveal yourself unwittingly somehow and end up on the streets.

**ANON:** Giving handjobs for crack?

**SEK:** If you must.  

**ANON:** I must.  So what do you think your readers want to know about failure?

**SEK:** How to avoid it.

**ANON:** Don't go to grad school.

**SEK:** Granted.  

**ANON:** Because once you're in you're doomed.

**SEK:** Granted.  But I think people would be more interested in the particular failures they ought to avoid.

**ANON:** Complete with revealing details?

**SEK:** They will be curious.

**ANON:** I would be too.  But I'm not into gratification.

**SEK:** We've been trained.  I hear a bell and look for a lever.

**ANON:** So should we riff behaviorist or tell the people what they want to know?  

**SEK:** The latter.

**ANON:** We should start by having you ask me a probing question.

**SEK:** If you had once piece of advice for people about to hit the market what would it be?

**ANON:** Perspective.  Never travel without spare perspective.  For me it came from reading Junot Díaz's [_The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594489580/diesekoschmar-20).  Not the book, which I started when I was next to death with pneumonia, and put down immediately upon recovery to continue reading journals relevant to my field.  It's the quotation that opens it:  "[Of what import are brief, nameless lives ... to Galactus??](http://acephalous.typepad.com/ofwhatimport.jpg)"

**SEK:** So your advice to candidates is to take consolation in the fact that the entire planet isn't being devoured by The Eater of Worlds?

**ANON:** The alternative requires an absurd calculus of merit and need that no human will be able to fathom short of the Singularity.  

**SEK:** I'm not sure how follow Galactus.

**ANON:** You can't.  That's why he's King of Perspective-Bringing.

The candidate must deploy their perspective with care:

"Does it seem right to you, lady, that one is punished a heap and another ain't punished at all?"

I truly don't get this "merit" thing, either.  Pondering it too long will drive one to God or to drink (but NOT to bitterness--that's in case I ever decide to run for political office).

I hope grad school doesn't drive me crazy, too.

The best advice I ever got for graduate school was:

Remember, it's not the best, nor brightest, nor the ones with the most to give that succeed, it's the ones who persevere through all the muck.

As my advisor used to say, endeavor to persevere.

I'll have to strive to remember the lessons of Galactus and perspective at faculty meetings too. It may help knowing that it isn't the entire world that's being devoured, but just a tiny piece of my soul.

The best advice I was given, particularly coming to the end of my PhD, was 'you never finish; you just stop'. It didn't help me get to submission day with any less stress, but it might have, had I listened to it...

For the future: Collect the rejection letters! You can make a scrap book later and show it to your kids/students/graduate students...

I find it more theraputic to reuse my rejection letters for writing grocery lists.

Does "perseverance" mean "working hard over a long period" or "putting up with endless, annoying bullshit"? 

Both, I suppose. A lot of professional training, as described to me, seems like the kind of hazing you go through when joining fraternities and criminal organizations.

I read this kind of thing and feel frighteningly lucky.

Apparently, my experience of pulling off a PhD in 3 1/2 years, not feeling like I was in an insane asylum, and landing a job six months later (not in academia, but what the hell) is so rare as to be noteworthy. Go figure...
