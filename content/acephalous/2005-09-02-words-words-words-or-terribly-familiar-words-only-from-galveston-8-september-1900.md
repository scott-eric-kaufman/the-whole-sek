By dark the entire city was submerged.  The flooding of the electric-light plant and the gas plants left the city in darkness.  To go upon the streets was to court death.  The wind was then at cyclonic velocity, roofs, cisterns, portions of buildings, telegraph poles, and walls were falling, and the noise of the wind and the crashing of the buildings was terrifying in the extreme.

During all this time the people...were like rats in traps.  The histest portion of the city was four to five feet under water, while in the great majority of cases the streets were submerged to a depth of ten feet.  To leave a house was to drown.  To remain was to court death in the wreckage.  Such a night of agony has seldom equaled.
