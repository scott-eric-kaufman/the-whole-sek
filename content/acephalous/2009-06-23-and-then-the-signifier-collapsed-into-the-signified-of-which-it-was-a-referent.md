**SEK:** Did you realize they customized horns now?  

**COLLEAGUE:** What do you mean?  

**SEK:** Car horns.  They customize car horns now.  

**COLLEAGUE:** Like the _[General Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_General\_Lee)_?  

**SEK:** Sort of.  I was waiting to cross the street, the light turned green, but the lead car didn't move, so the one behind it went "HONK!  HONK HONK HONK!"  

**COLLEAGUE:** That's customized how?  

**SEK:** You don't get it.  It went "HONK! HONK HONK HONK!"  

**COLLEAGUE:** That's what my car does.  

**SEK:** You're still not getting it.  It went "HONK!  HONK HONK HONK!"  Like h-o-n-k "HONK!"  

**COLLEAGUE:** You mean like it honked the word "HONK!"  

**SEK:** Exactly.  

**COLLEAGUE:** So the car _said_ the word "HONK!"  

**SEK:** I wouldn't go that far.  

**COLLEAGUE:** It was a talking car.  

**SEK:** No.  

**COLLEAGUE:** But it spoke.  

**SEK:** No.  

**COLLEAGUE:** You just said it _said_ the word "HONK!"  

**SEK:** I didn't say it _said_ it.  You know, [Wordsworth on Martian beaches and what-not](http://www.scribd.com/doc/16692775/walter-benn-michaels-the-shape-of-the-signifier).   

**COLLEAGUE:** Jesus fuck, I understood that.  I need to get away from you English people.

It's not really analogous to rocks on beaches; somebody who was capable of themselves saying "honk" deliberately made the horn, intending it to make the sound they make when they say "honk," which gives some additional reason to say that the horn says "honk."

Frist of all, [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB-wmOYelnM&feature=related).

Second of all, I'm not sure I understand what you people are saying, but I feel pretty confident in asserting that the word was applied to describe the sound of the existing device, not the device designed to express the sound of the word.  Also, the existence of geese predates both word and device.

And now, having posted, I'm pretty sure that I misunderstood the entire point being asserted about horns and "honk"-ing.  I'm still pretty confident about the geese, though.

I figure the odds of the honker being an English or art major themselves are about 75%!i(MISSING)t takes a certain sort....

I know the point of the post was about the fun that can be had with a car with a horn that makes the sound of 'honk' (I think you're right.  It doesn't say 'honk'), but I ended up reading that essay.  Even though I read it carelessly, and I'm not a philosopher of language at all, a few things jump out at me.  

1.  Why is Searle so universally cited? Is it just because he and Derrida very publicly antagonized each other? 

2.  In the spirit of 1, there's a lot of ways that the discussion feels cursory.  He opposes a view on which the meaning of a set of marks depends on the speaker's intentions to one on which it merely depends on the formal characteristics of the marks made (or sounds, etc).  That discussion leaves out what I take to be an obvious alternative, that it's the formal characteristics plus some other feature, such as being produced in a certain way, namely by a language user.  That's not yet a reductive explanation, because it relies on the notion of a language user.  You might try to reduce that notion to having mental representations which are caused by objects in the world and so on, or you might be non-reductive.  Again, not being a philosopher of language, this just a guess, but I'd suspect something like the above story would be the default position of a majority of analytic philosophers.  

Now, more speculatively, I think considering that type of position would've greatly complicated what followed in that paper.  I can't substantiate that because I have a much weaker grip on the development of the paper after roughly page 10, but I had the sneaking suspicion that he was exploiting the appearance that he'd laid out mutually exhaustive options.

While driving in North Carolina in my car bearing a gay rights bumper sticker, an anti-war bumper sticker, a back windshield decal from an Ivy League university, and out-of-state tags, I once accidentally cut someone off.  He then tailgated me for a while while continuously beeping his horn, which sang Dixie.  I'm sure his intent was to intimidate me, and while he wasn't entirely unsuccessful, my passengers and I were mostly amazed at the fact that someone could buy a horn that would play Dixie.  Then we looked away.

I have a car horn that says in a thick French accent, "Phallogocentrism."
