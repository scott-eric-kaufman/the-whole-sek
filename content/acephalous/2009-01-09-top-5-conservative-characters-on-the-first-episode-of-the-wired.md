I first got into HBO’s hit television program _The Wired_ about two years ago. A stranger mentioned it to the person in front of him at the _700 Club_
cafeteria, and by the time I finished the first episode, I knew I would
be telling people I was completely hooked. (This, by the way, is my
Recruitment Rule for _The Wired_: watch the first four minutes.
If you don’t like it by then, dump out.) I am so excited by my
enthusiasm for the show, in fact, that I often tout the first episode
of _The Wired_ as the best show in the history of television. I
don’t simply love this episode for its terrific acting, wonderful
writing, quirkly plotting, or mind-boggling twists. I also love it
because of its subtle conservatism. Here are the top five conservative
characters on the first episode of _The Wired_. Beware—SPOILERS INCLUDED.

![wire1-rawls](http://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/wire1-rawls.jpg?w=200&h=181 "wire1-rawls")

**1. William Rawls:** John Doman’s tough Homicide
investigator, William Rawls, is the top conservative character on
television, bar none. Rawls is a real man’s man, a true paragon of
conservative integrity. He knows that America is a meritocracy and,
according to Wikipedia, in [Season 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William\_Rawls#Season\_4)
openly attacks the reverse racism of affirmative action by proving
that, instead of working up the ranks honestly like he has, the blacks
in the Baltimore Police Department were recruited up the chain of
command because of the color of their skin. This racism created a
leadership vacuum, and like true conservatives, Rawls knows the value
of a true leader of men. He may not always love the men beneath him, but
he knows they need discipline and is determined to give it to them.

**2. Jimmy McNulty:** If every public servant showed
McNulty’s commitment to civic duty, we would never have heard the
odious phrase “President-Elect Obama” said without a snigger. In this
episode alone, McNulty attends a trial when he could have been at home
and stays up all night to make sure his report is on his deputy’s desk
at 0800 clean and with no typos. Here he is in a clip from Season 2,
going above and beyond the call of duty:

He’s also a family man who wants nothing more than the judge to give him more than three out of four weekends with his children.

![wire1-snotboogie](http://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/wire1-snotboogie.jpg?w=200&h=211 "wire1-snotboogie")

**3. Snot Boogie:** Every Friday night, anonymous
young black men would roll bones behind the Cut Rate, and every Friday
night, Snot Boogie would wait until there was cash on the ground, grab
it, and run away. Snot Boogie knew these games were unsanctioned and
bravely confiscated the illegal proceeds even though he knew the young
black men would catch him and beat his ass. To do what you know to be
right, no matter the consequence, is a true conservative value.

**4. The Anonymous Young Black Men behind the Cut Rate:**
The anonymous young black men behind the Cut Rate are American icons.
They let Snot Boogie in the game even though he always stole the money
because “[i]t’s America, man.” But it's not _liberal_
America, man, as should be obvious both by their devotion to the idea that
while this is a free country, all decisions have consequences, and their commitment to capital punishment. They could have just whooped
Snot Boogie’s ass like they always whoop his ass, but the anonymous
young black men behind the Cut Rate know how to prevent the next
generation of Snot Boogies from repeating the mistakes of the previous.

![wire1-stringerandbarks](http://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/wire1-stringerandbarks.jpg?w=200&h=148 "wire1-stringerandbarks")

**5. Avon Barksdale and Stringer Bell:** I cheated
here, but this is a Top 5, not a Top 6. Avon and Stringer are pure
capitalists, compassionate but tough. Avon is a family man. When his
cousin D’Angelo comes to him asking for a job, Avon and Stringer decide
to give him one. But both men know there’s no such thing as a free
lunch, so they also decide to teach D’Angelo that, in America, hard
work is its own reward. Everyone has to start in the pit, but with a
little hard work, anyone can end up running a tower.

The first episode of _The Wired_ is a show chock-full of
conservative values. It mentions God and quotes the Bible on a regular
basis. It debates police vs. criminals and free enterprise vs.
socialism. It promotes the value of the nuclear family—virtually every
character on the show has dealt with a broken home, and they all pay
the price for it. But everyone should know that the first episode of _The Wired_ is one of the most conservative shows on TV. That’s part of what makes it so juicy.

And I guess this is why they call this "the Balzac of Baltimore":

So, my above comment makes it look like I didn't get that this was a parody. But what I didn't get was how getting the show's name wrong is part of the parody, since the original didn't get its show's name wrong. Was there some other joke there, other than just laying it on thick?

I was just laying it thick.  On another _Big Hollywood_ post from the same day, someone'd identified Henry Rollins as the lead singer of his favorite punk band, the Vandals, so I was in a get-names-wrong sort of mood.  In retrospect, I probably should've left the name alone.

Let us not forget that Rawls is a closeted homosexual.  No RINO, John Rawls.
