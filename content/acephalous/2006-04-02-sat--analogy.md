Didn't you just have a fever a few days ago?  How is it that you can still come up with hilarious stuff like this while sick when I'm just beginning to be able to read something slightly more complex than the backs of cereal boxes?

Which reminds me, I should blog again soon, shouldn't I...

Something about the way you set up this post made me wonder what would happen if we intentionally 'broke' the logic of analogies. 

Instead of "A is to B as C is to D," why not "A is to B, is to C, is to D...." ? 

In short, a never-ending series of relationships without a bridge.

A is to B, is to C, is to Kevin Bacon...
