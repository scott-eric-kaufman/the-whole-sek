I should begin by thanking my [drive-by insult-smith](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/branded-im-a-mcdonalds-level-reader.html) for reminding me what I'd written about Gene Wolfe four years back, because it should've been the foundation of the [Updike post](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/must\_we\_still\_pretend\_to\_like\_john\_updike/).  In [that earlier post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/on\_terrible\_neo/), I claimed Wolfe suffered from

something that needs a better name (or an
agglutinative one) than "brilliant-one-trick-pony syndrome."  What I mean
is a stylist who employs the same breathtaking style in every single
thing he or she writes.  Some would accuse David Foster Wallace of
being one such stylist.  But his novels, shorts and essays are
focalized through a variety of characters.  Because each of his
characters speak with a unique voice, his overall style remains
heterogeneous despite his penchant for footnotes and sentences of
Faulknerian length and complexity.  (_Brief Interviews With Hideous Men_ works as a perfect litmus test: no one "interviewee" sounds like any of the others or,  for that matter, Hal from _Infinite Jest_.)  

Gene Wolfe, however,
suffers mightily from brilliant-one-trick-pony syndrome.  It doesn't
influence my impression of any one, two or three of his novels, but
once some critical point has been passed the cumulative effect of his
prose stylings begins to falter before the law of diminishing returns.  [Consider] _The Fifth Head of 

__Cerberus_.  It begins when Severian—I'm kidding.  Severian isn't in this collection.  _But he could be_ _if you judged by narrative voice alone_.

Here's Adam Roberts, [responding](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/on\_terrible\_neo.html#comment-9611995) to that point in 2005:

I was very struck by [Scott's]
original point about stylistic monotony. It's not that Wolfe is a bad
writer, but that he is a writer incapable of changing (or perhaps
disinclined to change) his writing style. There _is_ a flatness to reading long stretches of Wolfe; and I don't just mean late Wolfe, the _Long Sun_ and _Short Sun_
books where he falls lazily back on endlessly elaboration couched in
the form of dialogue. The whole corpus: it's all so stylistically
monologic. 

Some writers develop a laziness born of talent: once they've mastered their idiom, they elaborate on their strengths instead of confronting their weaknesses.  Here's Adam Roberts, responding to a very similar stylist today:

That’s where his genius was—his extraordinary, fluent, particularised
style; the way he evoked the specificity of detail.  But one of the
things that follows from this is that his larger artistic project
stands or falls on whether we consider _the details_ adequate to
the business of representing experience.  Updike’s whole corpus is a
way of answering this question with: they are; indeed, there’s really
nothing more than the details.  His stuff is overwritten, but in the
way the _Ode: to Autumn_ is overwritten.  Of course you may feel
that a writer needs something more than the details; that s/he needs a
panoramic ability, or at least a larger vision.  But I’m not so sure. 
Which is to say; I wonder if, when we look back on the second half of
the twentieth century, we won’t find ourselves saying: that was the age
in which people became queerly obsessed with details and minutiae, and
the larger patterns faded from public consciousness.  If so, then
Updike captured the spirit of the age better than almost anyone. 

I think Adam's correct: Updike's precision limited the kinds of narratives he could tell to the kind of narratives he told.  If an author aims to catalog the lives of a particular class of people without sounding like _An American Tragedy_-era Dreiser, aping Updike is the way to go.  

Before this becomes a general tussle about whether form governs content or content dictates form, I'll say that self-conscious stylists like Updike don't make for good generalizations.  The argument here should be whether Updike, consciously or otherwise, selected his subjects because they complemented his style; or whether his style dictated who he could write about.  

The almost unbearable flatness of his female characters leads me to believe the latter.  His precision depends upon an intimacy a person can only have with him- or herself.  Had he been more self-conscious about the phrasing of the words he put in other people's mouths, his narrators wouldn't have spoken so similarly.  Had he been more self-conscious about the tenor of the thoughts he stuffed in other people's heads, his narrators wouldn't have been dogged by the same fears to the same ends.  Put differently: Updike worked to refine the voice he knew he had, and why not?  

It was a magnificent tool for telling the stories it led him to believe he wanted to tell.
