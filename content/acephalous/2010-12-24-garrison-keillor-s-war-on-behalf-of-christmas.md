## Garrison Keillor's War on (behalf of) Christmas

I'd like to think [this was on purpose](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-12-16/news/bal-op.keillor16dec16\_1\_silent-night-unitarian-christmas), but I have my doubts:

And all those lousy holiday songs by Jewish guys that trash up the malls every year, Rudolph and the chestnuts and the rest of that **[dreck](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dreck)**. Did one of our guys write ‘Grab your loafers, come along if you wanna, and we’ll blow that shofar for Rosh Hashanah’? No, we didn’t. Christmas is a Christian holiday—if you’re not in the club, then buzz off.

Golly gee whiz, Mr. Keillor, if you don't want us to write your songs, we don't want you to use our words.

Boy, would he be fucked in Japan. And here I thought Christ was an American...

You know, I'd almost forgotten that screed. I still can't decide if the Unitarians or the Jews were what sparked the column, but either way it's ignorant crap. You could rewrite it as a Roman complaining about the "War on Saturnalia" but I'm not sure it's worth the effort. Just makes me glad, after all these years of wondering, that Keillor never wrote more about Jews.

His use of "dreck" was purposeful, I thought -- it was because he was imagining that he was addressing Jewish people.  He's an anti-semite that's down with our lingo, yo.

There are no longer "Unitarians" in the U.S., except for a few individual churches.  Without looking up the church, I'd guess that it almost certainly was Unitarian-Universalist.  That's officially no longer a Christian denomination.  If he wanted to hear a Christian song, he should have gone to a Christian church.

@KYKLOPSJP: First, I want to know what's behind the acronym.  Second, _of course he was_, and white, too ...

@Ahistoricality: I didn't realize it was a year old, as it was sent to me today.  My bad.  That said, apparently it was satire ... poorly executed, and with no proper target, but "satire" nonetheless.

@Rich: It may well have been, but when you're as overly earnest as he is, and when you have a sense of humor that only appeals to people with gums for teeth, you've got to recognize that your satire's going to fall flat.  He may think he knows his audience, but I believe most of them are dead, and have been for some time.

Most of the time I like Keillor, and I'm a long way from dead. This didn't read like satire to me. This was a rant, or as [close as Keillor gets](http://www.palibandaily.com/2009/12/21/garrison-keillor-gets-into-christmas-spirit-with-anti-semitic-tirade/) in print. I don't remember ever seeing Keillor walk it back, though [it got an immediate negative response](http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/22606/garrison-keillor-doesn%!E(MISSING)2%99t-like-jews-writing-christmas-songs/) that he [couldn't have missed](http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/blog/karen-hollish/keillor-christmas-and-jews-funny-or-not). I haven't seen anything suggesting that he recanted or explained it. Let me look.... Nope, not seeing it.

Awesome. I've always wanted more than "obtuse pauses while reading poetry" and "tedious folksiness" to dislike that guy for.

Ahist,

I think Keilor felt he had enough of a reputation as a liberal pluralist type that it would read like obvious over the top satire.  I think by way of target he was thinking, per the post title, of the whole War on Christmas nonsense, with this sort of thinking being the logical extension of that: "Oh, so you hate 'Happy Hollidays?' Well, you must hate Irving Berlin too."

I agree with Scott that it fails as satire.  Like the unfunny Larry David satire on the tax cut extension for rich people, I think it misses by being far too dry for its own good.

@JPool -- I had the same thought, i.e. it was meant as satire but went too far.    

I would also say that his criticism of the commercialization of Christmas is dead on. 

@Ahistoricality -- I like Keillor too, most of the time, and I'm far from dead and have all my adult teeth.

I'd add that there is plenty of dreck written by christian composers, either original songs or "reworkings" of classics.  I heard one of these at a UCC service on Christmas Eve and it was a train wreck.

The only time I remember GK issuing a public apology for a spoof that misfired was on the occasion of his "If gays want marriage they'll have to act more mature and stop cavorting" column.
