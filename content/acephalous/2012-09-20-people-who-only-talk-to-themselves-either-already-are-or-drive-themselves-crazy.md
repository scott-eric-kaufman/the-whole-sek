## People who only talk to themselves either already are or drive themselves crazy.

After the past week and, well, [the past twenty-four hours](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/todays-philosophical-inquiry),
 I think it's become clear to conservatives that their strategy to 
install Mitt Romney in the White House has failed. As strategies go, it 
had its charms: conservatives would only talk and watch and read other 
conservatives, thereby eliminating the possibility that they might hear 
or see or read anything that failed to conform to their prejudices. For 
months, this strategy seemed to be working. They had convinced 
themselves and each other that Obama, being the worst president in the 
history of the United States, couldn't be elected again if the 
opposition candidate had some appeal to the center. So they chose Mitt 
Romney.

Unfortunately, Mitt Romney also chose them. He started to appeal to 
the conservative base in order to acquire what had already been 
delivered. He was supposed to bring in the centrists, but he and his 
campaign chose tactics designed to further secure the base. The irony is
 that his appeals to the base have only angered and alienated it. His 
"inelegant" iterations of their cherished theories have set the terms of
 the national debate against conservatives, such that any argument about
 equitable taxation must begin by discussing the 47 percent instead of 
job creation. In the war to frame the debate, conservatives now believe,
 Mitt Romney has unwittingly played the role of Benedict Arnold.

With the former opportunist Romney now considered an extremist, what 
are the actual extremists to do? If the past week is any indication, 
they are going to spend the next two months losing their shit to 
establish their _bona fides_. Now that they have no reason to appeal to center, or to rational thought generally, we are in for [two months of](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/09/20/Obama-cult-of-personality-iconography-semiotics):

Barack Obama has been building a cult of personality 
reminiscent of  fascist leaders. That doesn’t mean he’s a fascist; it 
doesn’t mean that  he’s Hitler or Mussolini or Stalin. But his semiotics
 and iconography  are far more suited for a fascist country than a 
vibrant republic.

Of course Ben Shapiro has no clue what "semiotics" actually means, 
but it makes him sound like an authority on something, in this case 
the "fascist" field of branding. Instead of being annoyed that, from 
Shepard Fairey forward, the Obama campaign team has simply demonstrated a
 more sophisticated understanding of contemporary advertising than any 
of its Republican opponents, Shapiro wants to claim that the use of 
"iconography" is "far more suited for a fascist country than a vibrant 
republic." And it doesn't matter how many images of the Twin Towers 
falling or acting Presidents in flight suits you show him, Shapiro will 
never believe that any other administration has ever used the power of 
singular images to sway public opinion. It's only ever been Obama.

This is but the tip of the iceberg.

The knotted fringes of the far right movement no longer have any 
reason to remain tangled, so as their weak coalitions unravel expect to 
hear more about every inane and insane theory that's dogged the 
administration since before Inauguration Day 2009. I fully expect the 
next two months will witness some of the most absurd political theater 
ever to grace the American stage, and I fully expect that while some of 
it will make me weep for the state of our great republic, quite a bit of
 it will provide me with an endless hours of entertainment.

As if on cue, [INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM](http://t.co/TtEQ482A) arises from the sepulchers of the conservative press, with zombie attacks galore.

Breitbart's upped the bounty on the Khalidi tape to [$100,000](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2012/09/20/Reward-100000-for-Khalidi-Tape), which I can't help but hear in the Dr. Evil voice, because, really? That's all you're willing to spring to save America from its greatest internal threat ever?
