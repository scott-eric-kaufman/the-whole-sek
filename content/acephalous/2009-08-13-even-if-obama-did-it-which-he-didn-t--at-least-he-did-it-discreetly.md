In a [belated comment](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/07/a-stubbornness-in-the-face-of-fact-that-is-unbecoming-of-an-academic.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a547cc8e970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a547cc8e970c) on [this post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/07/a-stubbornness-in-the-face-of-fact-that-is-unbecoming-of-an-academic.html), David Brewster links to a photograph he took that neatly brings the conversation back to the subject of [that [other blog](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/) where they always post about Muppets]:
