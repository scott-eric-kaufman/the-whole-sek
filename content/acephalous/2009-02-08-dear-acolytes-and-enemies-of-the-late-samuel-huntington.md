I understand that a [search](http://www.google.com/search?q=%!e(MISSING)ric+kaufman%!)(MISSING) for the author of [this article](http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article\_details.php?id=10578) leads here.  That doesn't mean I'm its author.  You want [this guy](http://www.bbk.ac.uk/polsoc/staff/academic/eric-kaufmann).  Please learn how to use Google.  

That is all.
