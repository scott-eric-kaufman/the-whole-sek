## Queering Turner Field?

So there I sat, on the couch, watching the Braves slaughter the hapless Mets with one eye and reading David Dobb's _Reef Madness_ with the other, when I see Jose Reyes foul a ball off into the stands.  For those of you unfamiliar with the conventions of baseball telecasts, after a ball is fouled off the camera sometimes follows the ball into the stands, finds the person that caught it and zooms in him or her.  As often as not, the foul ball's caught by a young man accompanied by a young woman; and often as not, the young man's reward for shagging the ball is an enthusiastic, energetic kiss--both the young man and the young woman hopping at this point--from the young woman whose life he saved with a timely shag.  

Turner Field, the home of the _Atlanta_ Braves, sits outside the city proper.  Braves fans are notoriously rural--famously supporting John Rocker after his diatribe on the purple-haried queers with AIDS who comprise the entirety of the Metropolitan Transit Authority's communter population--so when the camera followed the Jose Reyes foul ball into the stands and captured two _men_ engaged in ritual post-ball-shagging osculation, I could hear the clinking of millions of Pabst Blue Ribbon cans hitting the floor from all the way out here...

...on another, more scholarly note, the following query came across H-Net's American Studies listserv this morning:
Can list members suggest ways to introduce the topic of sexual orientation into a pre-Civil War American literature survey?

Let me translate that for you:
I want to engender a discussion about a historical period but I don't know any works in that historical period that will allow me to introduce the only subject I'd like to address, so could some of you people who know the primary works in the period I've been hired by my university to teach tell me which ones I can queer so I don't have to stop reading Judith Butler to do something unimportant like gain expertise in the field in which I have a Ph.D.?

Sometimes rampant unprofessionalism amuses me; sometimes it disgusts me; sometimes it leaves me numb.  Cross your fingers and wish me the last tonight.
