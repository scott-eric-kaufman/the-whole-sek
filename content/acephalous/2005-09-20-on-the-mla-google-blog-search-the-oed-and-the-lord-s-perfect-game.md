## On The MLA, Google Blog Search, the OED and The Lord's Perfect Game

Since I couldn't very well incorporate these thoughts into the prior post:

1.  I _will_ be attending the MLA this year.  Everyone I've met here who will be there should sit down somewhere and have some beers.  I hear Edmund Wilson also wanted to spend the convention on a bender.  Why not help make his dream our reality?  (Shout out in the comment section or send me an email.)
2.  Since Google unveiled [Google Blog Search](http://blogsearch.google.com/) this humble blog has been oogled by oodles of googlers desperately seeking gossip about themselves.  I have more hits by Vanity Googlers in the past three days than I've had since I opened Acephalous.  I can only imagine that—having seen the short spot on Google Blog Search on CNN this weekend—they thought that everyone they have ever met in their entire lives has probably published something about them on their respective blogs.  Desperate to gain entry to the Great Halls of Gossip they beseeched the Gods of Google for guidance .... only to end up here. 3.  Someone finally informed the editors of the online edition of [_The Oxford English Dictionary_](http://www.oed.com/) that a search algorithm which can shuttle even chronic misspellers to the promised land would be an excellent way to circumvent the paradox dogging American schoolchildren: _If I knew how to spell it I wouldn't have to look it up in the dictionary!_ They still ought to code it such that it don't crash when people look up "[algorhythm](http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/findword?query\_type=word&queryword=algorhythm&find.x=0&find.y=0&find=%!B(MISSING)Perform+Find+Word+search%!D(MISSING))."  (That is a blank screen you see.  That is my point.  Compare it "[algorithm](http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50005609?single=1&query\_type=word&queryword=algorithm&first=1&max\_to\_show=10).")
4.  I hear thunder.  I see lightening.  I live in Southern California.  (_sings_) _One of these things is not like the other.  One of these things is just not the same._ (_sheepishly ceases_)  What I mean to say is that outside my window it is thundering something so fierce even the Louisianians swear the Lord aims to bowl Hisself 300.

I'll be there, conducting interviews, but I don't know if I'm going to be able to escape the departmental suite (four job searches! arrrgh!).

I'd donate the disposable income before going to MLA across the country without being on the market or presenting a paper, but I at least plan on being there.

Excellent!  Miriam, if you have the time to spare I'd love to do lunch again.  And Jonathan, while your sarcasm is appreciated as always, we should at least grab some beers and maybe play a little two-on-two with whoever else in the building looks like they could handle it. (I know you watch and assume you play.  If I'm wrong, I've wasted a summer's worth of six a.m.s working on my moves in the post.  Also, I should reiterate that my advisor's been called "The Greek God of Networking," so it's no surprise that he wants to outfit me with armloads of introductions and send me off not M.L.Wilderness..._and_ UCI will pick up some expenses..._and_ I'll be abusing my father's frequent flyer miles, of which he will accrue many, many more as ExxonMobile works its refineries in Chalmette and Baton Rouge up-to-speed..._and_ if I have to spend any more time dissertating in seclusion I may crack.  So all-in-all the MLA strikes me as a healthy alternative.)
