'Tis the season for my traffic to return, but sadly, I'm too depressed to do much with it myself now.  So why not do for others?

*   I've yet to mention how good _[Victorianitas](http://victorianitas.blogspot.com/)_ is.  [Examples](http://victorianitas.blogspot.com/2007/09/caffeine-induced-midnight-trance-is.html) [abound](http://victorianitas.blogspot.com/2007/09/ways-to-identify-postgraduate-student.html).
*   If you value your sanity, do _not_ read to [this](http://philosophyjobmarket.blogspot.com/) blog.  It tosses bagged kittens into rivers and feeds upon their kitten screams.  (Seriously: it subsists entirely on a diet of kitten screams and puppy tears.)
*   [A White Bear](http://istherenosininit.wordpress.com/) also [mauls](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/comments\_7523.html#639407) animals.  (Only her victims are acceptably ugly, and she uses every part of the carcass, out of respect and a love of blood pudding.)
*   Sisyphus [needs to write](http://academiccog.blogspot.com/2007/09/fo-shizzle-its-drizzle.html).  She's not alone.  Help me by helping her.  (But remember who butters your virtual bread.)  (That would be me.) *   Wally [ignores](http://waxbanks.typepad.com/blog/2007/09/elementary-prin.html) Fredric Jameson but writes well regardless: "You don't wonder whether it was true to what you thought you wanted,
you measure whether it's written with conviction and (structural)
integrity."  File under "sentences now taped to the top of my monitor." *   Thanks to [Collin](http://collinvsblog.net/archives/2007/09/bloggability.html), I'm now officially [paranoid](http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2007/09/20/assumptions/).  __
*   _War of the Worlds_ translates into a beautiful [funny book](http://www.darkhorse.com/zones/wotw/wotw\_popup.php?p=1).  (The entirety of which can be read online.)
*   [Catherine](http://outtamindouttasite.typepad.com/outtasite/2007/07/silver-lining.html) should read _Oublié sur la Carte_'s [account](http://oubliesurlacarte.wordpress.com/2007/09/23/rilo-kiley/) of the punchline to Rilo Kiley's joke.

Now that I think about it, none of those sites need any help from me for traffic, which means this has been an exceptionally bad blog post, brought to you by an exceptionally bad blogger.

Man, you sound down.  I invite you to consider: worse things happen at sea.  Also relevant are the apothegms, _cheer up love, it might never happen_ and _why not turn that frown upside down?_

More to the point, you are _not_ a bad blogger.  You're a _good_ blogger.

Mmm, all that bitterness and despair over at APJMB was tasty. I feel better already, like a Dementor who just needed to suck a few souls dry to cheer up a bit. 

Also, here's a riddle: when you are completely locked in sloth and procrastination and writer's block on a paper, the surprise extension of your deadline by a week is a) the worst possible thing that could happen, b) the best possible thing that could happen, c) Cheetos.

Ah, maybe you have time to answer a [little question](http://mlyhlss.blogspot.com/2007/09/poetic-justice.html), then?
