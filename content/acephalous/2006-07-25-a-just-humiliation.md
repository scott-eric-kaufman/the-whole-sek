## A Just Humiliation

Earlier today, on a [blog with unlinkable comments](http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/comments/1001/), I wrote:
Never fails.  Correct someone’s spelling?  Alwasy wtih a coupel fo
typso.  Praise clarity and precision?  Always needlessly verbosely,
with neither wit nor style evident in the presentation of the intended
declamation, and frequently with errors of a grammatical nature, as
evidenced in the previous comment _vis-a-vis_ subject-verb agreement.

The same Law of Just Humiliation applies to outbursts of blog triumphalism.  Yesterday's [post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/can\_blogging\_de.html) applauded in cluttered, clunky prose the clarifying influence of regular writing on the awkward word-stylings of academics.  Terrible, it was, what I wrote, thinking I did so well.  When, in truth, I failed in practice of that which I preached, and most egregiously, no less.  But, I contend, even in this failure—complete though it be—I learned that on a blog you can only merely ever aspire to champion a cause like clarity, because you cannot revise unless you plan posts weeks in advance.  But to do so would defeat the purpose, transfude the daily writing into a daily written chore ... and who among working academics does not already possess hoards of chores they blog to banish momentarily?

If I extravagate into distant, anti-triumphal territory tonight, I do so because I lack the means to trochiscate some palliative into an easily digestible form.  Would that I were possessiant of a pill expatiative, a curative of such impressive spectrum as to wither all fears and roots.  Were that my fears more meloniform, that I could [shoot](http://images.usatoday.com/sports/nba/\_photos/2006-04-07-allen-large.jpg) or [swat](http://acephalous.typepad.com/beltran30607881.jpg) sans purfle and sink or jack them thus from yardland ... 

... by which I mean, I'd delve into the _OED_ and make myself feel a little less stupid and pointless by parading my recently acquired vocabulary before all you ignoramuses.  You know, all y'all who don't recognize them words I wrote previously immediately.  Y'all have to "consult" some dictionary to sensify me?  I'm so much more superior.  You may as well as go do what I feel like doing but am "cleverly" "disguising" by "insults" I'm sure y'all "take" "to heart."

Doomed, we are, and to terrible things, no less.

I LIKED yesterday's post.

And I like ths one too.

I read old posts and wince. When you write from 1 am to 2 am, you tend to make a LOT of mistakes.  And I am one such perpetrator of verbosity, needlessly writing and repeating myself until the setences are too long, and I've already explained everything twice and the sentences become too convoluted. 

(Shrug)  I think (or hope) every act of writing improves us as writers.  Our blogs may not be the \_best\_ examples of our writing, but they certainly help contribute to our better examples.  

And like I said, and needlessly verbosely repeat:  I like your writing.

The Law of Just Humiliation is a more general form of the [Hartman/Skitt/McKean Law of Prescriptivist Retaliation](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%!E(MISSING)myl/languagelog/archives/002035.html), which was independently discovered by three different people in 1999:   

[Jed Hartman](http://www.kith.org/logos/words/lower3/hhhyphen.comments.html) ("Words & Stuff", April 20, 1999): "Any article or statement about correct grammar, punctuation, or spelling is bound to contain at least one eror".  

[Perchprism/Skitt](http://groups.google.com/group/alt.usage.english/msg/21dc5c6c8b333660): (alt.usage.english, April 26, 1999): "Any post correcting an error in another post will contain at least one error itself" or "The likelihood of an error in a post is directly proportional to the embarrassment it will cause the poster".  

[Erin McKean](http://www.verbatimmag.com/Sum99.html): (_Verbatim Magazine_, Summer 1999) "Any correction of the speech or writing of others  

  will contain at least one grammatical, spelling, or typographical error."
