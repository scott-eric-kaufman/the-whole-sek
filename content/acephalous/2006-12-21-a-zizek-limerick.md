## A Žižek Limerick

			There once lived a man named Žižek,  
Whose prospects were middling to dreck.  
Then he got real turned on  
Watching _Trek_, _Wrath of Kahn_,  
His next ten books will be about _Shrek._

Scott, I must know. What is your opinion The Matrix and V for Vendetta? You know...those high echelons of cinematic expression?

Middling to dreck?  I feel Slavok needs a corrective:

We all know a writer called Zizek  

Who is often subjected to pish-take  

By writers whose fear is t-  

-o be labelled theorist  

And whose brains are the size of a fish-egg

... indeed, I feel _Slavoj_ needs a corrective.  Slavok can shift for himself.

David, that odd "echelon" has me wondering whether your question is sincere or not, but I do remember what Zizek said about _The Matrix_: namely, that it was one of the many, _many_ of "[the few films which function as a kind of Rorschach test](http://www.lacan.com/matrix.html)."  If you're asking for my appraisal of the Wachowski brother's _oeuvre_, well, that would take more time than I currently have.  But I do like requests, so if you're serious, say the word...

Adam, I wasn't mocking Zizek there, just remarking on his well-known dreckdom in the '70s.  Insufficiently Marxist to be hired, he wandered, jobless, translating a little here, a little there, before hooking up with Jacques-Alain Miller in the early '80s.

Adam R.'s limerick seems to presuppose an incorrect pronunciation of Zizek's name.

None of Adam Robert's lines really rhyme in his limerick above.  Is that a purposeful commentary through [anti-limerick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick\_%!p(MISSING)oetry%!#(MISSING)Anti-limericks)?

Well, if backed into a corner and forced to defend myself, I'd say that the limerick needs to be read aloud with a strong 'if Sylvester the Cat were Slovenian' accent.  Then it rhymes just perfick.

Incidentally, Scott, wasn't suggested that _your_ brain is the size of a fish-egg.  Unless we're talking a big-old fish.

There once was a petit objet a  

That receded from sight, _comme au fait._  

Zizek: "Don't sweat it.  

That shit? It's systemic--  

stuck to your shoe. \*Now, what about the revolutionary possibilities of Christianit-ay?"\*

Um, the letter "a" in French is pronounced like "ah."

It sounds like we need some remedial rhyming lessons.

Adam R., This presupposes that Zizek would mispronounce his own name, due to his accent.  Your premises are faulty.

_Um, the letter "a" in French is pronounced like "ah."_

Not when I say it. I'm a medievalist: we determine the pronunciation _from_ the rhyme scheme.

From someone Slavoj picked up the knack  

of killing himself through The Act  

He traverses, emerges,  

has the _same_ set of urges,

...ah, christ, can't finish it.

Scott's limerick is a rhythmic disaster.  Rhyming "Žižek" with "to dreck" and "about Shrek"?  (Not to mention that utterly prosaic last line.)  I expected better of you, SEK.

Perhaps you should stick to that less demanding verse form, the clerihew:

Kaufman, Eric Scott,  

Despite what he thought,  

Could never quite  

Get the meter right.

Man, the thread's full of critics today. But thanks Wolfson for stepping up with an example, even though not a limerick. 

Luther, I LOL'd at your ending, but what I want is something that at least references something Zizekian. I pulled out my _Plague of Fantasies,_ thinking _that_ would give me something good, but I couldn't figure out how to jam, say, "Spielberg's _Star Wars_ Trilogy" [_sic_!] in. Or, hmmm, can we do something from this: "The very masculine _activity_ is already an escape from the abysmal dimension of the feminine _act._  The 'break with nature' is on the side of woman, and man's compulsive activity is ultimately nothing but a desparate attempt to repair the traumatic incision of this rupture" (_Enjoy Your Symptom!_ 46).

Ah! How about this:

From someone Slavoj picked up the knack  

of killing himself through The Act.  

He traverses, emerges,  

has the _same_ set of urges:  

ceaseless repairs of the lack.

Not funny, and clunky scanning on that last line, but this is closer to what I want.

The last line's supposed to be jarring, ben : 8-8-6-6-9.  With em_pha_sis falling on the second-_to_-last syllable in the first two lines.  

(And yes, Luther wins.)

By which I mean, the "ten" inserted in the last line is out-of-place on purpose, because it _is_ odd to think that Zizek might write ten books on _Shrek_ as opposed to one, but it is a possibility.

Wow, I'm impressed Karl could slip that in in the time it took me to have a thought.  For the record, Karl's is superior to mine; but in my defense, I don't have any of my Zizek in Houston, so it's not like I could've consulted it.

Superior, schmuperior. 

Here's a better last line, though:

To ceaselessly patch up his lack.

While it's not grammatical ("to ceaselessly patch up" is only one "urge"), it scans better and it's a little more faithful to Zizek: but it's _still_ not funny. While at my grocer, I kept trying to do "who put the Zi in the Zak." It works a la James Brown's "I don't know karate / but I know ka-razy," but it's still not as funny as Luther's.

Dammit!

So: I cede.

Why isn't Jodi Dean giving this a try?

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to make my wife some chicken soup to kill her cold so she doesn't pass it on to me and make me do my interviews next week with snot running down my chin. Wish me luck.
