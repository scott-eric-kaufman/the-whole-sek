Because no source is more unimpeachable than "'_So when you see Dre, a DJ on the Mic_' in _alt.rap_ (Usenet Newsgroup) 26 November 1996":

Oh, please please please let Chaucer be reading this today... (I-blessed be thy breche, and every stoon!) Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the phrase "flippen-flappin'" first appear in Horn Childe? (Maybe it was Rolle-- not that one could tell th'one from t'other, of course...)

_Woman I can hardly express, my mixed emotion at my thoughtlessness..._\*

If you can afford that, don't give me the "starving graduate student" routine, OK? :-)

I meant the OED's _free_ "Word of the Day," not the OED itself.  I have the thing on disks, though, for whenever I can't access it through the university.  Of course, I'll be denied updates like "bootylicious," but somehow I'll survive.

As a a frequenter of clubs and discos, straight(ish) and gay(ish), I think the canonization of "bootylicious" is fabulous.  Some girls are simply bootylicious.  Boys, on the other hand, cannot be bootylicious, even if -- like me -- they have ample man-butt.  Then there's the musical description use of the word: "Damn, this new Chamillionaire track is mad bootylicious," meaning, "When this song comes on the high-fidelity stereo system, many beautiful women with generous helpings of ass will come out to shake their moneymakers."

What's great about bootylicious is that it's uses are severely confined.  You cannot say, "That blouse is bootylicious."  It makes no sense.  You cannot say, "This Mozart concerto is bootylicious."  You cannot say, in fact, that \*any\* text is bootylicious, except maybe the passage of \*Ulysses\* where Bloom kisses Molly on the ass before going to bed, head to toe.  

And hey, Beyonce's new album is so crazy bootylicious, I don't think she can do any wrong these days.
