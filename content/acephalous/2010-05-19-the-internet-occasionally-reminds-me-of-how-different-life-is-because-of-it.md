## The Internet occasionally reminds me of how different life is because of it.

I [noted
 on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=6021853&v=wall&story\_fbid=105036059543362&ref=mf) that, from a statistical perspective, what makes 
baseball such an amazing sport is that you can watch it your entire life
 and still see, on a daily basis, something you’ve never seen before.  
 (It’s a truism, I know, but it has the benefit of actually being 
true.)  In this case, the something in question was watching the 
wonderfully named Angel Pagan hit an inside-the-park home run and 
initiate a triple play in the same game.  [John Emerson](http://haquelebac.wordpress.com/) responded 
with some humbug about it not being an inside-the-park grand slam, 
which made me remember that I _had_ seen an inside-the-park grand 
slam at some time in the remote past.

I remember being six or seven years old and watching the Mets play 
the Cardinals in an afternoon game at Shea Stadium, and thanks to the 
miracle of the Internet, I can _definitively_ say that [at
 approximately 4:30 p.m. on 9 June 1985](http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN198506092.shtml), I watched Terry Pendleton 
 hit an inside-the-park grand slam off Joe Sambito in a game the 
Cardinals would go on to win handily.  The fact that I can verify vague 
 memories of events that occurred twenty-five years ago astounds me in a
 way I sometimes forget the Internet is capable of doing.

This realization is obviously not of world-historical importance, 
merely a reminder that this thing whose existence we take for granted 
daily represents a fundamentally weird complement to human memory.  The 
 fact that at some point in the future I can know who I rode in an 
elevator with on 28 December 2005 is less weird because [I chose
 to write about riding in an elevator with Grimace](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/12/contemporary\_fi.html).  That I can 
access detailed information about events I have no right remembering in 
detail is another matter entirely.

Joe Sambito. Wow.  I'd completely forgotten about him.  I sometimes wish I could forget that Pendelton is the Braves hitting coach.  Closest I came to that was watching Dale Murphy get tagged out at the plate on what would have been an inside-the-park slam.

He pitched for the Astros before he came to the Mets, stayed for '85, then he pitched for the Red Sox against the Mets in '86 World Series.  I remember him being ineffective, and as it turns out, [he was](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sambijo01.shtml).  Now that I remember him, which I didn't before, I remember him as being the pitcher who'd pitched for 1) the team the Mets faced to get to the '86 Series and 2) the one they faced in it.  I didn't remember that I remember that, but now that I do, I do.  Memory, as Gertrude Stein would say, is funny.

Apparently the drug use, sexual excess, and weird UCI  experiences haven't softened your brain yet.

What's really bothersome, though, is when you _only_ remember things from your distant past. 

My grandpa was alert till the end, but when I last saw him at age 92 everything he wanted to talk about was 70 years in the past.

A guess, but perhaps your grandfather's life at 22 was more interesting than the ensuing 70 yrs.

Yeah, I remember Sambito from the Astros (when the Braves were in the old NL West because it made sense to have a team 3,000 miles from most of their division rivals).  Solid pitcher for a while. But burned out toward the end.  Apparently, he is a player's representative now.

I like to read about others watching baseball more than I like to watch baseball by a factor of nine.  Having given up on watching the actual sport, mention of baseball now only sparks memories of The Old Man and the Sea and the old time baseball writers.  It is true that at the end of time, the old time baseball writers will be hailed as the very best writers, as they had access to an event that was susceptible to beautiful writing, but horrendous to watch in person.  Plus, they smoked a prodigious quantity of cigarettes.    

nota bene:  An overdue library book is a crime against Humanities.
