## The Annual Baseball Post

Even religious readers of this humble blog have a somewhat skewed sense of my priorities.  Yes I love everything I write about . . . but there's something else I love which I rarely mention.  But today is opening day.  (For the Mets.)

So without further ado I present a picture of the tough-as-nails,
more-masculine-than-a-bag-of-hammers man in whom I've invested my hopes
and dreams and envious aspirations:

The women swoon and the men, well, they swoon too when they see mighty David take the field.  Sometimes he wows us with his [barehanded](http://acephalous.typepad.com/wrightbarehanded1.jpg) [theatrics](http://acephalous.typepad.com/wrightbarehanded2.jpg); other times with his uncanny ability to keep his hands close to his body and [drive the ball the other way](http://acephalous.typepad.com/wright01.jpg); and others still with his unworldly work ethic and [frightening intensity](http://acephalous.typepad.com/davidwright01.jpg). 
(To any gay medievalists who fawn over Sir David while obliterating me
in a distracted game of chess who are reading this: a picture of [your favorite Met playing grabass with Nick the Stick](http://acephalous.typepad.com/wrighttouching.jpg).  And to think some people have _the nerve_ to call our beloved national past-time "homosocial.")

So that's something like rounders, isn't it?

Little Brother, you say that as if I didn't TIVO the game and watch it over the course of nine hours today.  I _do_ take breaks, you know.  Sure it takes me a little longer than most to finish a game, but still . . . 

[_obligatory Americanism_]

Rounders?  What is that?  Some faux-sport like cricket which _actually_ takes like nine hours to play?  _Or_ three whole weeks.  No wonder the sun set on y'all's empire, what with all your best and brightest spending weeks attending a single match.

"Rounders? What is that?"

[obligatory Britishism]

A game that girls play.  

[/obligatory Britishism]

And surely we should celebrate the fact that cricket caused the downfall of Empire?  If only this "baseball" of which you talk could do the same.

I feel no need to rib Scott on his Baseball fascination.  I have no doubt it's a diverting way of passing the time.  But it's hardly the  [most important event of the year …](http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/)  (I was going to write 'sporting event', and then I thought: who am I kidding?)
