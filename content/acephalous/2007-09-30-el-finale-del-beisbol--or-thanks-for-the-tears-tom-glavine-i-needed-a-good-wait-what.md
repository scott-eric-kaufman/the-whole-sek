Real Men—the _[manly](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2007/09/to-last-day-and-beyond.html)_ [ones](http://www.edrants.com/?p=6810)—never revealed the [number 5](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/the\_annual\_base.html) stenciled on their back as they cradled their head in their hands [this afternoon](http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap;\_ylt=Akxs074bp1HzJ3muVjbb1sI5nYcB?gid=270930121&prov=ap). 

Real Men—the _manly_ ones—never cradled their head in their hands this afternoon so no one would see them choke back tears.

Real Men—the _manly_ ones—never wrote this post while choking back tears, because Real Men stopped crying hours ago.

(As for us—the _emasculated_ ones—we cling to the hope _Dioses del Béisbol_ will prevent [pessimism](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/09/pessimism-unbou.html) from becoming prophecy.)

You are evil.  Not once evil, but twice evil.  You call yourself an anti-capitalist, a socialist, a revolutionary, but you worship the Evil Empire?  My tears, they are Brooklyn tears, _proletariat_ tears, whereas yours, they are the tears of the master.  So wait, you bastion of white-bread _béisbol_, just wait!  _Los Mets_ will rise from the ashes, like some [bizarre pelican phoenix](http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/tul/sports/m-footbl/auto\_action/1400078.jpeg) not even the [explanation of which](http://media.www.lsureveille.com/media/storage/paper868/news/2007/09/25/Sports/Lsu-To.Wear.Purple.Jerseys.Against.Tulane-2989567.shtml) makes sense.

Listen, you. I just got back to Boston today, and let me assure you, I've had more than enough of the hysterical over -estimation of what a given team _means_ to last me for several months. Seriously - the tendency deserves it's own "something-fallacy" to describe it. (Although, when it comes to the Mets this season, "pathetic fallacy" fits in oh so many ways...

Teams do not mean; they simply are. The Mets simply are... (are totally choke-artists etc...)

When we brown folk of the world unite, you and your white brethren will be perfectly gamed by a resurgent _**PEDRO**_!  This is the truth that I know to be true.  Doubt it at your peril.

Know this: [We come for you, Yan-kee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUM2WAoGAOU).  _Le Français_ can't help you now.  

You're ours.  (Next year, that is.)

Hmmm. Just hmmm... 

(You really think there's a chance next year? What with the young guns the Yanks brought around this season? Please, god, don't let them sign Bonds and throw it all away...)

If there's a bright side, it is this: it throws the Losing-est Team in Baseball History (the Philadelphia Phillies) the NL East.  But I'm no stranger to heartbreak, being a Phils fan, and I suspect they will go boom like the Mets did.  So, even though I'm rejoicing in a temporarily triumphant Philadelphia team, I do feel your pain.

And I agree, let's just keep Bonds out of the equation altogether.

_And I agree, let's just keep Bonds out of the equation altogether._

Actually, I think Bonds is _just the thing_ that the Mets keep to fulfill, um, the current trajectory. From my lips to Minaya's ears...

Obviously, the Yanks chances depend on whether they keep A-Rod and Posada.  If they do, they have a shot; if they don't, they sign Bonds, Giambi plays 1B, Mike Lowell plays 3B, and they're screwed.  

As for the Mets, the future looks bright: Pelfrey and Humber battle it out for the fifth spot in the rotation; Milledge plays everyday in RF; Alou exercises his option, or if not, Gomez starts and we have the most amazing defensive OF ever.  (And [Fernando Martinez](http://mets.scout.com/2/669622.html) may even be ahead of Gomez in terms of development.)  So I doubt we'll sign Bonds -- and looking back, I'm satisfied with what Omar did and, more importantly, didn't do last off-season: he didn't sign Zito, he signed Alou, &c.

So yes, I'm optimistic ... esp. when I consider the state of the Phillies farm system.  (Sorry VC.)
