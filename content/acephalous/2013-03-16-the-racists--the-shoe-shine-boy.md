I'm still waiting for reputable conservatives to repudiate Scott Terry's [statements](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/03/you-can-tell-hes-a-liberal-plant),
 but I understand if they're reluctant because I couldn't prove that the
 Scott Terry whose reading list I linked to is the same Scott Terry from
 CPAC. [Now I can](http://shotgunwildatheart.wordpress.com/2013/03/16/welcome-all-ye-disenfranchised/):

Many of you are visiting this blog due to the recent CPAC
  controversy, where my friend Matt Heimbach and I, made national news 
by  showing up and asking (in civil, articulate tones, mind you) a few  
simple questions.

What was our main concern?

There is a lot of rhetoric in the conservative movement about  
reaching out the mestizo demographic, or reaching out to the homosexuals
  and blacks.

**Our question: why not reach out to whites?**

In case you had any doubt about whether his concerns were racialist or racist in origin, here's how he answers that question:

This is exactly what the GOP needs to do, as a matter of 
fact.  Steve  Sailer and the guys at VDARE have done an excellent job in
 pointing this  out.  Please educate yourself about the [Sailer Strategy.] (http://www.vdare.com/articles/the-sailer-strategy-updated-three-steps-to-save-america)

It's not that he _hates_ black people, he's merely upset that

The GOP wants us all to blend together into a mocha-colored, capitalist utopia!

And he's working on more reading lists! Here he is [trying to define the "Kinist" canon](http://shotgunwildatheart.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/a-kinist-research-project/). What's so bad about that? So long as you also believe [that God ordained the social order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinism)
 and advocate that man's first duty is to "love one's own kind," 
absolutely nothing! And Terry takes "lov[ing] one's own kind" very 
seriously. Just [look at his alarm clock](http://shotgunwildatheart.wordpress.com/2013/03/07/wake-up/):

[A beautiful white girl was slaughtered](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2289518/Christina-Edkins-prophetic-tweet-month-stabbed-death-journey-school.html) while taking a ride in the top of a double-decker school bus; the cry was heard:  “Wake up!”

Another beautiful white girl, the more beautiful because she was in the late stages of a pregnancy, was [attacked by a gang of twelve savage animals](http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/breakingnews/os-sanford-fight-arrests-20130211%!C(MISSING)0%!C(MISSING)5319980.story).  A white lawyer stands in passionate defense of one of the animals.  The sane yell “Wake up!”

If I were a professor of rhetoric, I might have something to say 
about Terry's choice of unnecessary adjectives here, if only because he 
seems as obsessed with the deaths of "beautiful white girl[s]" as a latter-day Nancy 
Grace. But that's not to say Terry doesn't have culture. He [goes to the theater](http://shotgunwildatheart.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/the-only-anti-semite-in-a-crowd-of-fiddler-fans/) to see

a half-descent [_sic_?] portrayal of a group of Godless pagans, prancing around  in their celebration of the downfall of Western Civilization.

Is that a pun or one of those Aryan-equivalent-of-Freud's slips? 
Doesn't matter. This man, with his belief in the separation of races and
 the divinely ordained social order (which he just so happens to sit 
atop), is clearly an outlier in the modern conservative movement. No _real_ or _respectable_ conservative holds these beliefs, or at the very least, no _real_ or _respectable_ conservative would air them this unabashedly.

A _real_ or _respectable_ conservative like _National Review_'s Jillian Kay Melchior would write a paean to "[[t]he simple shoe shine](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/343101/putting-shine-cpac-jillian-kay-melchior)" in which, through great effort, she managed to avoid using the word "boy." She would _write_ nothing of the divinely inspired social order, but instead  let the accompanying photograph _say_ a little something about it:

[![shoe shine boy](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/shoe-shine-boy.jpg "shoe shine boy")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/shoe-shine-boy.jpg)

And unbeknownst to Mechior, this shoe-shine man, Dino Wright, knows 
exactly which game he's playing when he "creat[ed] this entrepreneurial 
activity":

CPAC and events like it boost business for Wright. He 
says he thinks  it’s because he “provides a very important service to 
this very  image-conscious group.”

You'd have to be as dense as Melchior to believe the "service" he's 
paying to "this very image-conscious group" has anything to do with 
shining shoes.
