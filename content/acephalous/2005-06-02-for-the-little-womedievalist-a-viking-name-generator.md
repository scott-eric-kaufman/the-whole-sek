## For the Little Womedievalist: A Viking Name Generator

[c/o Ralph E. Luker over at [Cliopatria](http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/12248.html).]

I request that everyone refer to me by my new Viking name, Eyvind the Bloody.  What's [yours](http://archaeoastronomy.co.uk/?p=270)?  If you don't like it, find [another](http://www.thequarter.org/Media/VikingName.php) new Viking name.  Another Viking alias of mine is Styrkárr Wulfflattener...and if someone could tell me what that means, I'd appreciate it.  

P.S.  If it means "Flattener of Wolves," well, vegetarianism be damned, I have wolves to flatten!  Possibly styrkárrily!

Hey, no fair; why do I have to be "Herjólf the Forgettable"?

Because you are?  I mean, really, when you go, do you really think the world will notice?  It's not like you're someone important like, say, Eyvind the Bloody.  Have you ever even flattened any wolves?

I've always been enamoured of the Viking king, Ivarr the Boneless, who apparently was so named for having his bones all made of cartilage instead of, um, bone.

His distant cousin, Fenrik the Oven-Ready was fairly cool too.

Now I'm Ingibjörg Saxonsbane.  At least people would have a viable excuse for mangling _that_ name.

Popping my full name into the generator, rather than just my first name, I got "Sigmund the Beserker."  Better than "Herjólf the Forgettable," but I think it's still better suited for one of your cats.

As you say that, he's balled up in my lap being about as adorable and un-beserker as is felinely possible.  How's that for irony?

I guess "Rachael the Beserker" or even "Rachael the Ball-Biting Destroyer" would be more appropriate.
