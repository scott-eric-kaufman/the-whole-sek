## “Certain lives are not worth living. Certain people, we should not spend the money to keep them alive…”

Consider this a bookend to Ari’s [post](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/08/19/it-is-not-yet-a-matter-for-international-concern/), as those are the words of Hitler according to this protester:



According to her and those like her, Hitler didn’t _actively conspire to murder millions of people in the service of a racist eugenics_,
he passively refused to “spend the money to keep them alive.”  Who are
“they” here?  Because she claims that “limiting Medicare expenditures
in order to reduce the deficit . . . _is_ the T-4 policy of the Hitler—of a Hitler policy in 1939,” she must be talking about those killed under the auspices of the _Aktion T-4 Euthanasie_: the _lebensunwertes Leben_, or “life unworthy of life,” _i.e._ the elderly, the mentally disabled and the otherwise infirm. Par for the course for those who believe in “death panels.” 

However, if people like this protester possessed a perspective of
more depth and extension than the Wikipedia Brand Knowledge currently
bandied about conservative discussion boards and listservs, they would
know, for example, that the _T-4_ initiative was prohibitively expensive. Its predecessor, the _Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses_,
or “Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring,” which
mandated the sterilization of the physically and mentally disabled, had
been scaled back because it was too expensive. That is, they _stopped_, not _started_, the ideologically-based murders of those they considered defective because it would save Germany a few million _Reichsmarks_. 

This should go without saying: the Nazis _wanted_ to kill these people, they simply couldn’t _afford_
to. In fact, it was only in 1939, after they’d planted a war on both
horizons, that Hitler could justify the expense required to expand the _T-4_ initiative into the concentration camps. 

In short, whatever Obama’s policy will be, if it is, as this protester claims, designed to _reduce_ the national deficit, it won’t resemble _Aktion T-4_ one whit. Moreover, the category of _lebensunwertes Leben_
wasn’t limited to those with mental or physical handicaps as we
currently understand them: opponents of Nazi policy were routinely
deemed to be insane and euthanized, meaning that so long as this
protester and those like her are free to berate Barney Frank with
patent nonsense, [Godwin’s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%!s(MISSING)\_law) is still in full effect.

Oh yeah? That sounds suspiciously like something Adolf Hitler would say!
