To counter recent accusations of [poetry](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/29/brain-damaged-historians/#comment-16197) and [overcompensation](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/29/ticked-offhist/#comment-16174), an example of what the inmates write when the guards clock out:
[In the chapters to follow,] I will demonstrate the pervasive influence of these non-Darwinian theories of evolution on late 19th and early 20th Century American literature, paying particular attention to how the haphazard traffic of scientific ideas in intellectual circles alters our understanding of theories of romance, realism, and naturalism.

To build on the traffic metaphor, picture an account of these three novelistic modes as an interstate traveling in two directions: north represents a progressive commitment to social betterment through science, south a conservative commitment to the agrarian ideals of the early Republic.  In the conventional account, realism and naturalism occupy the northbound lanes, romance the southbound.  The realists responsibly drive Honda Accords north, five miles per hour below the posted speed limit; the naturalists muscle Ford Mustangs between them—one hand on the wheel, the other on the stereo—thirty miles per hour above the limit; while the romancers, they plod south, in aggressively polished Bentleys, driven by the help.  The forced homogeneity is meant to be instructive: not all Japanese cars are Hondas, nor are they all driven impeccably; not all American cars Fords, nor do they all careen by whim of inattentive hand; and not all European cars Bentleys, nor are they all piloted with soft disgust by the help. 

But my metaphor's limitations parallel those of the conventional account, inasmuch as both betray an underdeveloped appreciation for detail and an overweening urge to categorize.  A more accurate metaphor of the cultural scene, circa 1900, would have all three modes traveling north, as all three are equally committed—albeit distinctively, as will be demonstrated in the chapters to follow—to a broad conception of social development via applied science.  In this account, self-proclaimed realists sport makes and models from across Japan and Southeast Asia: a Honda Civic jockeys with a Toyota Tundra for inside position until a naturalist in a Pontiac Grand Prix emerges from the shadow of a Chevy Silverado and cuts the corner and secures the lane occupied by a southbound-facing romancer in Rolls Royce who slams into reverse and proceeds north, backwards, as best he can. 

This final image—a menagerie of law-abiding Southeast Asian imports hurtling north alongside masculine American machines as both dodge Old World status symbols whose terrified drivers mistakenly believe everyone else wildfires north in the southbound lane—this final, chaotic image closely approximates the bounded diversity of turn-of-the-last-century American culture.  Generalizations remain, certainly, but unlike the conventional account, they exist in a manner suitable to and for further differentiation.  All Japanese and Southeast Asian cars are not Accords or even Hondas, nor are all American cars Fords, and so on.  Moreover, while the driver of a speeding American SUV shares some beliefs and dispositions with the cautious driver of a American coupe, he may share other, more important ones with the driver of a Rolls Royce convertible: the drivers of the coupe and the convertible may be headed for the same exit; the driver of the convertible may share an entrance with the SUV; the driver of the SUV may share an exit with the with the driver of the coupe; or the driver of convertible may be cuckolding the driver of the SUV.  Point being, any or all of these distinctions may be critical to understanding their choice of vehicle, preferred entrance and exit, and behavior on the road; shouldering them into a model whose perceptual threshold cannot account for idiosyncratic decisions and behaviors will produce results which say more about the model builder than the thing being modeled. 

Although some generalizations still obtain in my account, I embrace the inevitable jams, accidents, pile-ups, and rubbernecking, because the alternative—excluding historical contingency for the sake of conceptual clarity—insisting a southbound _facing_ car is a southbound _traveling_ car—entails the unnecessarily imposition of contemporary norms on a period best characterized by the deliberative nonsense of its maximal diversity.

To enumerate every the sin committed above would be demoralizing, but five grievous ones bear mention:

1.  The metaphor does not explicate a complex matter so much as muddle one with additional complexity.
2.  The idea is too apparent in the execution.  I literalized the metaphorical traffic of intellectual exchange because the final image—a southbound facing car traveling north in reverse—struck me as a compelling analogue for the hypocritical claims of historical romancers. 3.  The passage is [overwrought](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2008/07/passion-of-manohla-dargis.html).  Who allowed me unfettered access to semicolons and em dashes?  Why does he still work here?
4.  Cars?  Seriously?
5.  I mean for _seriously_ seriously?

My complaints notwithstanding, I still believe in this passage for the simple reason that the image in my head _works_: it organizes numerous (often conflicting) theories of literary tradition and historical causation into something I can easily manipulate in my head.  (Plus I can mentally forward 5:10.20 seconds into [this clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVSRXU0dZR8) and Be The Dissertation I Want To Write.)  As written, however, it seems deliberately designed to confuse. This is a problem a better writer might know how to solve, but who has time to consult better writers when his dissertation is due in a little more than a month?  

**UPDATE:** Maybe I just lack [the right ingredients](http://academiccog.blogspot.com/2008/07/how-to-cook-dissertation.html)?

Since when are [Proton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton\_(carmaker)) and [Perodua](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perodua) exporting to the west? And where are the Korean car companies in all this?

_Metaphor Hypnosis_ is a tragic disease affecting many brave dissertaion writers.  Right now there is no cure, but there is hope.  Won't you please, _please_ help.

"; or the driver of convertible may be cuckolding the driver of the SUV."

What the?  This wasn't as good a try as the [Alan Fiske](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/relmodov.htm) [lesbian BDSM softball players](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/summer\_reading\_project\_adam\_bede\_chapters\_22\_26/#21573), admittedly, but what makes people decide to spice up their academic paper with ... oh, never mind, to ask that question is to answer it.

Seriously, that's one of the classic markers of desperate narrativity.  You want to tell a story, but you're trapped in a genre that doesn't support it?  Throw in an example involving sex.  Because sex makes stories.
