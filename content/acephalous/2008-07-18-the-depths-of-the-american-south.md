## The Depths of the American South

As the [some of you caring for my cats](http://tonguebutnodoor.net/) already know, I'm off tomorrow to reacquaint myself with the depths of the American South.  (I _am_ a Future Mississippi Landowner, after all.)  Blogging may be light, as the internet is carried in buckets uphill both ways during violent thunderstorms down there, but I'll do what I can.  In the meantime, feast on [my appreciation](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/07/the-dark-knight.html) of _The Dark Knight_, or [Gerry's](http://gerrycanavan.blogspot.com/2008/07/dark-knight.html), or the one [I'm compelling Adam](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2008/07/friday-afternoon-confessional-hella.html) to write via the Power of Link.

(And remember, kids, this ain't [a substantial academic post](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/18/line-jumping-and-emotional-strategies/#comment-15312) on an academic blog so much as announcement of future unavailability of the sort common to academic listservs, so complain at your own risk.)

You academics are probably too lazy to even find your own buckets, much less carry your own internet.  If you were a real, honest, hard-working American you'd whittle and join your own damn bucket.

Gah!  Personal blogging on you supposedly serious and important personal blog.  What's next?  Cat blogging?

(Say hi to the South for me and stick close to the air conditioning.)

Where will your plantation be?  Mine's in Kingston, just outside of Natchez.

Mine's just outside of Meridian.  The significant other is inheriting it, and we don't really know what to do with it, except walk around on it an love it or hide out on it if civilization collapses.
