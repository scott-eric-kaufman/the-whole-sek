## After G.I. Joe decided to take him down, his decline was swift. By Tuesday, he was on the phone telling a stranger to "Choke on [his] . . . !"

 * Wednesday, June 03, 2009



It was a quiet Sunday afternoon when I became an enemy of the state.  I was doing laundry, as you do, and was carrying a load of towels up three flights of stairs when suddenly the landing turned all "GO JOE!"  As I crushed [
Snake Eyes
](http://acephalous.typepad.com/files/25th\_singlepack\_snakeeyes.jpg) Eyes with my left foot and tumbled head first into a hamper of clean towels, I thought to myself, "If you're going to fall head first into something, you could do a lot worse than towels fresh from the dryer."  My head was safe, but with his dying breath, that wee plastic Snake Eyes rolled over and took my ankle with him.  I scream into clean laundry as my ankle pivots in ways God never intended.  

Knowing that I have to teach on Tuesday, on Monday I contact the people with the little carts and ask for a lift to class.  "No problem," a helpful person tells me.  "That's what we're here for," she says.  She takes down some information and assures me we're all set.  Someone will be at my place shortly before 7:00 a.m. to pick me up and take me class.  Fast forward to Tuesday morning.

**SEK:** (_looking at his watch_)  I'm ten minutes early.  Nothing can possibly go wrong.  (_ten minutes pass_)  Probably just running a little late.  (_five more minutes pass_)  Maybe I should call to check up.  

**PERSON WHO ANSWERS THE PHONE:** What?  

**SEK:** I'm calling about a ride to campus.  Someone was supposed to pick me up so I could teach.  (_shuffling sounds can be heard_)  

**DIFFERENT PERSON:** Can I help you with something?  

**SEK:** I'm calling about a ride to campus.  Someone was supposed to pick me up so I could teach.  

**DIFFERENT PERSON:** Right.  We can't do that.  

**SEK:** You can't do that?    

**DIFFERENT PERSON:** Right.  We need a doctor's note and you didn't provide one.  

**SEK:** I'm seeing the doctor tomorrow.  I can bring a note in afterwards.  

**DIFFERENT PERSON:** Right.  That's not how it works here.    

**SEK:** So how am I supposed to get to class?  

**DIFFERENT PERSON:** You live on campus.  Why not just walk?  

**SEK:** (_rage_)  If I could walk, I wouldn't have requested your services.  

**DIFFERENT PERSON:** Right.  We can't do that for you.  (_the shuffling sounds associated with hanging up a phone can be heard_)  

**SEK:** (_Rage_)  Better don't hang up on me.  (_more shuffling_)  How am I supposed to teach today if I can't get to class?  

**DIFFERENT PERSON:** Like I already said, you live on campus.  Just walk.  

**SEK:** (_RAGE_)  And like I already said, if I could fucking walk, I wouldn't have requested your fucking services.  

**DIFFERENT PERSON:** There's really no need to say "fuck," sir.  

**SEK:** [CHOKE ON MY FUCK](http://www.warrenellis.com/index.php?p=767), ASSHOLE!  


The upside is that I solved one of life's little mysteries: every quarter I teach the Warren Ellis piece linked there, and every quarter I'm rebaffled by that expression.  

I'm baffled no more.  

But you know what the best part is?  Guess what I see as I slowly limp my way to class?  A group of guys in a fraternity using one of those carts to haul around one of their gigantic Greek letters.

The spirit of the staircase, huh?  Interesting choice of words in this situation.

Gods damn it, I'm supposed to be an expert in this sorta thing.  So, as my kids say, "FML."  Only not really.  Still, I should've made some hay out of that, and hang my very tired, Spring-Quartered head in shame.

But _which_ letter, Scott?

I'm pretty sure that's not what Ellis meant, either, but yikes. You should point out to the cart-people (which sounds more like a category of homelessness than a social service) that they need to train their people to ask the right questions before making appointments, and then they'd have fewer people yelling obscenities at them.....

I still want to know what letter it was, but can I hazard a guess and say: it probably wasn't a mu or an eta? (And probably not upsilon or omicron or iota either.)

I'm starting to suspect that Scott has a whole _other_ blog, of which I am unaware, where he chronicles all the _nice_ and _fortuitous_ things that happen in his life, and reserves this one for all the rest ...

I mean, like, _dude_!  As we say in England.

I couldn't tell.  It was lying flat on the top of the cart and I'm not that tall.  

 _You should point out to the cart-people (which sounds more like a category of homelessness than a social service) that they need to train their people to ask the right questions before making appointments, and then they'd have fewer people yelling obscenities at them._

Believe you me, I lodged a complaint . . . and can't wait to pop wheelies and make donuts when they give me a cart tomorrow.  The high life, baby!

_I'm starting to suspect that Scott has a whole other blog, of which I am unaware, where he chronicles all the nice and fortuitous things that happen in his life, and reserves this one for all the rest[.]_

If only.  It's been a pretty shitty week all around, honestly.  More on that later, when I can find a funny angle on it.

Well, as long as you get to make art from your pain, you're ok. Get well soon! Don't ask me about repeat injuries, for I only have bad news for ya!

Isn't that like the ultimate geek injury?  Tripping over a G.I. Joe action figure?   Although I guess that since you were carrying laundry up three flights of stairs, it wasn't your action figure.
