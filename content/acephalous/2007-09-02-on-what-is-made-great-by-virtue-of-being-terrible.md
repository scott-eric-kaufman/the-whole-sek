## On What Is Made Great, By Virtue of Being Terrible

I need to lower the tone around here.  Too many of the comments are penned in too high a dudgeon, so I'm left with none but nuclear options:

Ogged [convinced](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week\_2006\_08\_27.html#005368) me to watch _[Entourage](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=entourage&tag=diesekoschmar-20&index=dvd&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)_![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1).  Like him (and those eligible to vote for Emmys), I was captivated by Jeremy Piven's man-child antics.  (Not that this is a [theme](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/10/blogfight\_an\_ou.html).)  (And seriously, I'm going to link to that post [again](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/10/blogfight\_an\_ou.html), because Piven's that genius and Luther's that [right](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/10/blogfight\_an\_ou.html#comment-23925535).)  

Tonight's episode—watched in a momentary fit of irresponsibility, as I'm now busier than I thought humanly possible—hammers home a point I've been flailing at for the last few weeks:

I'm utterly incapable of judging the quality of the show I've just watched.  Certainly, some scenes are pure wish-fulfillment, but who am I to say that they're merely an expression of it?  Might they not hie to the standards of televised verisimilitude?  How would I know?  

My ignorance of the lives of the famously wealthy and beautiful leaves me utterly unable to judge the accuracy of representations of their lives.  Since my interest in the show is predicated on Piven's outrageous responses to the absurd situations his clients force him into by virtue of 1) their famously beautiful wealthiness or 2) their obscenely exaggerated male-bondedness, I'm at an utter loss to distinguish between "quality" and "entertainment value."  

Because the lower the quality, the more entertaining it is.  Which means that as the quality of the show slips, it simultaneously increases ... leaving me watching a show whose merits I can't defend with a straight face.  I can't think of a single corollary of this in literature, but I'm sure one exists.  

So please, somebody, enlighten me ...

I have also [noted](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week\_2007\_07\_08.html#007122) that the current season is crap.  But I think your paradox is mostly wordplay: part of the appeal of the show has always been the bling, but it wasn't the main draw, and was excusable given the show's other redeeming qualities.  Tonight's episode was mostly bling, and if that appeals to you, hey, that's your issue.

I searched for that post, but figured I misremembered and it was a comment only wolfson'd be able to ferret out.  As for tonight's episode, it was awful, and on so many levels.  But I'm still interested in why I continue to be entertained by a show that's so abysmal when its absurdity isn't the set-up for a Piven punchline ...

... but maybe that's it.  Because I hold judgment in abeyance until I know whether the absurdity's a set-up, I'm able to enjoy its awfulness even if I don't receive my reward.

Not to lower the level of the conversation too far, but I believe that Bill "The Sports Guy" Simmons may have devoted half a column to how _Entourage_ is exactly good/bad enough to watch repeatedly and always wonder why you had.
