Remember [that commercial I mentioned last week](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/03/do-you-want-me-to-strangle-this-kitten-because-i-will) that some thought an outright fabrication, others an episode of _[Too Cute](http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/too-cute-kittens)_ seen through a zolpidem scrim__? It's _worse_ than I originally intimated:





Call him now, or the puppy gets it! What are you waiting for? Unsafe strangers from the Internet?

The best part is how he looks like he's not even sure what he's doing, as if there's someone off-camera holding the cue cards in one hand and a gun in the other, and he's doing the commercial under duress.
