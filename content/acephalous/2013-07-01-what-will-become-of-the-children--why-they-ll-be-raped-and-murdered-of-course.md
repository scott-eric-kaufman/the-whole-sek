_Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_ ranks among the worst shows on television. Not because of the acting -- though the fact that [Richard Belzer's been going through John Munch's motions] (http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/11/homicide.html)_[since 1993](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/11/homicide.html)_ has
 been obvious for about a decade now -- but because it's all 
exploitation all the time. Its bias is clearly liberal, but cruelly so, 
in that it manifests itself in the bodies of its victims: children, 
women, immigrants, non-whites, gays, lesbians, etc. But that only makes 
it worse, because I suspect that conservatives secretly love the show 
because it combines the victimization of marginal peoples with the 
systemic incompetence of the New York state police force and legal 
system. The world of _L&O:SVU_ is one in which white men frequently get away with doing terrible things to people conservatives don't consider people.

Which isn't to say that I don't also watch it. When it's on -- and it's _always_ on -- I can't stop myself. It's _that_ terrible. Last night, for example, I watched an episode in which [Big Boi was eaten by a pack of hyenas and Detective Stabler was shot trying to stop a man with a monkey in a basketball](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1248640/). Because _as we all know_ monkeys
 in basketballs are clearly within the purview of the Special Victims 
Unit. But you need not watch any particular episode to understand its 
horribleness, because it's right there in the Riefenstahlian opening 
credits. To the images!

[![law and order00001](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00001.png "law and order00001")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00001.png)

This is New York City, where all the American crime happens. This 
helicopter shot shows you how many people are in it and, therefore, 
how much crime is likely to happen. Which is a lot. Or would be were it 
not for:

This tough American woman detective. You can tell she's tough because
 she has her hands on her hips. You can't actually see that here, but 
the camera's going to pull back on this still image in a moment because 
this is _action photography_. Like in a documentary! With two 
notable exceptions -- which I'll get to shortly -- it's all panning and 
zooming on still images. It creates the illusion that you're going to be
 watching something along the lines of Ken Burns's _Civil War_, 
and in the distant past of 1990, when the style of the franchise's 
opening credit sequence was originally established, maybe you were. But _L&O:SVU_ is a far cry from those early episodes, so this here's a bill of goods. As is the first mini-narrative of the sequence:

[![law and order00003](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00003.png "law and order00003")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00003.png)

A close-up on the police line. A crime must have occurred! 
Fortunately, a still image of a speeding police cruiser is on the way:

[![law and order00004](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00004.png "law and order00004")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00004.png)

Will it get there in time? Will the criminal get away with it?

[![law and order00005](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00005.png "law and order00005")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00005.png)

He will not! The rapist has been captured! The residents breathe more
 easily. But wait! Just because he's captured doesn't mean he's been 
convicted. Might he not get away with the raping on a technicality?

[![law and order00006](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00006.png "law and order00006")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00006.png)

He will not! He and his raping hands are behind bars. The residents really can breathe more easily now. Who captured him again?

[![law and order00007](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00007.png "law and order00007")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00007.png)

A tough man-cop posing in front of a bridge! Note that the bridge and
 the man-cop occupy similar areas in the shot, almost as if the bridge 
is as important as the man-cop, unlike the tough American woman 
detective, who only had to compete with her own name. So what does this 
insignificant man-cop do?

[![law and order00008](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00008.png "law and order00008")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00008.png)

He finds missing babies! Only not really, because this is a still image _of a photograph_ of a missing baby that's hanging on a chain link fence. So all we know for sure is that he's _alerted_ to babies being missing and does something about it:

[![law and order00009](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00009.png "law and order00009")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00009.png)

Like finding them too late. This is crucial to the ethos of the show:
 the more sympathetic the character the more likely he or she will end 
up dead. The first mini-narrative was a tale of success; the second, one
 of abject failure. That baby had to die. Like the cruel god that it is,
 the show's narrative efficiency demanded a human sacrifice.  __ I'm
 going to skip past a character so irrelevant the credits almost do too 
and move on to the third mini-narrative, which involves the 
aforementioned Detective Munch:

[![law and order00012](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00012.png "law and order00012")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00012.png)

One of the benefits of looking like Richard Belzer is that you never 
have to age. Your hair cut and color may change, but you don't visibly 
age. Belzer is like Batman in this respect: like a proper character in a
 serial narrative, he's always been the-age-he-is and he'll always be 
the-age-he-is. But what' s Munch's story?

[![law and order00015](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00015.png "law and order00015")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00015.png)

Â 

A missing child! You can tell because this is a still image of a swing in motion, meaning that the child's _just_ been taken. What _ever_ can we do to save it?

[![law and order00016](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00016.png "law and order00016")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00016.png)

Identify a suspect! That's a grand idea! Now to question his known associates, and because this is a suspect on _L&O:SVU_, they're going to be:

[![law and order00017](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00017.png "law and order00017")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00017.png)

Prostitutes from New York-that-was. I get the feeling that the 
writers of the show are actually a little annoyed at the city changing 
for the better. Much easier to frighten people with the horribleness of 
the streets when the streets were legitimately horrible. But I digress. 
What happens next?

[![law and order00018](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00018.png "law and order00018")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00018.png)

Another victim? What happened here? This mini-narrative's ceased to 
make sense -- which is perfectly in keeping with many of the episodes. 
The monkey in the basketball episode, for example, began with the death 
of an underage model before it got to the rapper-eating hyenas and 
cop-shooting. The narratives on this show frequently veer wildly from 
their original premises, but that doesn't matter, because:

[![law and order00019](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00019.png "law and order00019")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00019.png)

_America_! It doesn't matter because _America_! This is
 one of the two exceptions to the still-image dictate: a full-screen 
close-up on a waving American flag. What does America have to do with 
sexually based offenses? I don't know, but sudden swell of patriotism is
 well-timed, because:

[![law and order00020](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00020.png "law and order00020")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00020.png)

This man is a cop! He wrote "Cop Killer" and now he's a cop! Is there
 anything that can get my mind off this black man on my screen?

[![law and order00021](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00021.png "law and order00021")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00021.png)

Another mini-narrative! This one begins with a photo-negative of a 
carelessly discarded doll. You can tell by its condition the 
impoverished circumstances of its owner. Or maybe its condition tells 
you how long it's been exposed to the elements. Either way you know by 
its condition that something terrible has happened to a child. Something
 like:

[![law and order00023](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00023.png "law and order00023")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00023.png)

Molestation? What the fuck is going on here? First of all, that's not
 a child. Second, that's a dead not-a-child. I suppose they can't 
actually show you someone being molested, but superimposing the word 
"molestation" over a dead adult body makes no sense. Unless we're to 
assume that victims of molestation are more likely to end up dead in 
miniskirts and heels -- which, now that I think about it, the show often
 wants us to assume. Anything else it wants us to assume?

[![law and order00024](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00024.png "law and order00024")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00024.png)

That the police will lovingly cradle us as we die -- even if we're 
poor black teenagers holding our arms like an addict on the verge of an 
overdose. These assumptions are getting unseemly, but at least they make
 sense, inasmuch as the show wants us to trust the police. It's almost 
as if they're fighting the image of Ice T with images of Cops Who Care. 
Because they do:

[![law and order00026](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00026.png "law and order00026")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00026.png)

Even if they're all white. _Which they're not_. Except when they are, they _really_ are:

[![law and order00028](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00028.png "law and order00028")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00028.png)

Now that that's settled, it's time for the _coup de grace_. This is the Hall of Justice:

[![law and order00031](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00031.png "law and order00031")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00031.png)

And what's happened to it?

[![law and order00033](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00033.png "law and order00033")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00033.png)

It's been perverted! I mean inverted! Who can save us?

[![law and order00039](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00039.png "law and order00039")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00039.png)

A bunch of people trying really hard not to move _because this isn't a still image_. In the original series, this closing scene involved the cast walking-and-talking in the Hall of Justice. But here they're _just standing there trying not to move_.
 It's the worst image of a police force imaginable: "We're the Special 
Victims Unit, and we're here to help. Just don't ask us to move or 
anything." It's also the moment that best captures the "dynamic" of the 
show: the narrative should be moving, and you think you can see it 
moving, but it's trying really hard not to lest it lose the "timeless" 
quality that allows it be re-run forever. Not despite but _because_ it's a terrible show.

Just watch the opening credits.

"The world of L&O:SVU is one in which white men frequently get away with doing terrible things to people conservatives don't consider people."

What a horrendous, unconscionable, and thoroughly illiberal statement. There is such a thing as improper comments made to exaggerate an impassioned point, and then there is prejudgment of large swaths of other people, people as every bit multifaceted as yourself. Accusing someone of denying the humanity of the Other (in the capital sense) is in a way denying their own humanity.  Labling one a degrader is a degradation onto itself. I will not be a idle party to such patronage. I have been a long time reader, so I know you hold Chomsky in no small regard, so I implore you  to refrain from reducing large groups into unPeople.

While I loathe to condescend to someone of your stature, I find your remarks unwarranted.  As a liberal, the sentiment scares me.
