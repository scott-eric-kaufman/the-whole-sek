I realize I've become one of those bloggers who blogs too much about his own life.  So coming soon, as in "after the post after this one," I'll try to return to the model I'd previously established and stuck to.

Because blogs should consider audience.

And because I enjoy blogging more when I do so.  

(Venting is good.  Not having much to vent about is better.)
