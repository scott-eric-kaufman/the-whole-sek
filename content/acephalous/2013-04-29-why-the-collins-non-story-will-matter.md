## Why the Collins “non-story” will matter

The most important aspect of Jason Collins’s decision to become the first theoretically employable openly gay male in a major American sport isn’t that this “accomplishment” requires that many qualifiers, but that he has a twin brother who’s a heterosexual. So much of the rhetoric about homosexuality focuses on whether God made homosexuals gay or whether they’ve [turned their back on the Lord](http://deadspin.com/espns-chris-broussard-says-being-gay-is-an-open-rebel-484708467) by succumbing to learned perversions. The distinct sexualities of the Collins twins seem a boon to those who think homosexuals are etymological perverts: Jason has “turned aside” from the righteous path that is his birthright. Why did he do so? He was converted by childhood trauma or an agenda-driven homosexual into thinking his feelings for other men were normal; which is to say he “turned with” an individual who convinced him that other men were as attractive as women.

God didn’t put the gay in him — someone abused it into him. Whether that abuse is sexual or rhetorical in nature matters less than the simple fact that it’s abuse. That it’s become socially acceptable for prime-time faggots to queer the very foundation of marriage is a sign that American culture’s in steep decline. Children are being converted into perverts — are turning with those who would turn them aside — and political correctness prevents decent people from objecting to this abuse. But all this talk of conversion and perversion obscures the fact that homosexuals haven’t always had their agenda implemented as precisely as a Zionist plot. Homosexuals were once considered a diaspora of narcissists who wandered the world looking for themselves. They were inverts. They’d “turned inward” and demanded of others the love the mirror denied them.

Which is only to say that the operative metaphor changed.

What was once thought to be a loathsome inversion of God’s love has become what happens to children when they watch _Glee_.  Because when you introduce contemporary American culture into the classic conversion narrative you end up with a system of dissemination indistinguishable from infection. You don’t need to convince someone to “turn with” you if society’s “putting in” or “doing to” them what the homosexual agenda wants it to. Which is why conservatives express their concerns about Collins’s revelation by [not caring _with thunder_](http://twitchy.com/2013/04/29/its-2013-nbas-jason-collins-comes-out-as-gay-clinton-swoons-others-yawn-who-cares/). So long as they ignore its importance the epidemic can be contained. They want Collins to become a non-story.  

Hence the significance of the fact that Jason Collins has an identical twin brother who’s straight. The temptation to use Jarron Collins’s heterosexuality as proof that Jason was either converted to or infected by homosexuality will prove too great. That Jarron shares Jason’s DNA but not his perversion demonstrates once and for all that God doesn’t sanction the birth of gay babies. Jason couldn’t have been born this way because Jarron was too _and look at him_. Which means homosexuality is essentially a function of bad parenting: parents either didn’t pay enough attention to who tended to or played with their children or they allowed their children to be exposed to the pernicious influence of American culture. Better parenting can prevent children from being converted or infected by homosexuality by regulating who their children meet and what culture they partake.

That Jason and Jarron met the same people and partook of the same culture isn’t significant because the first theoretically employable openly gay male in a major American sport couldn’t have been _born_ homosexual. Science says that stuff with the same genes is identical and therefore the gay can’t be genetic. You’ll see this argument repeatedly in the coming months — not because it’s valid but because Jarron Collins prefers sex with women. No grand conversation about how the same genes can express themselves differently depending on environmental factors will be had. The word “epigenetic” will not enter the national discourse. Why not?

Because as I type these words conservative “journalists” are combing through Jarron Collins’s life trying to discover where it differs from Jason’s. They’re searching for the Holy Grail of Gay and will use their rudimentary understanding of genetics to prove that someone either proffered Jason a sip or forced it down his throat. Jarron will become proof that Jason could’ve been “normal.” In short the “facts” of this particular case — as they understand them — accord too neatly with operative conservative metaphors for them to let it become a non-story.  They will run with this because they mistake language for logic. They will run with this because they mistake logic for science. They will run with this because it eliminates God from the suspect pool.

And unless we point out that theories based on “conversion” and “infection” as are arbitrary as those predicated on “inversion” _they will be successful_.

In the long run, this can only be good for the cause of sexual equality and freedom. Everyone who's been paying attention knows that the "born this way" rhetoric being thrown around by certain sectors of the mainstream gay rights movement was a time bomb: a disingenuous oversimplification of something (human sexuality and sexual identity) that is not simple in the least. Embracing the naturalistic fallacy and trying to redirect its prescriptive ends is a terrible strategy if your goal is freedom and equality. I understand why it happened, and desperate times sometimes call for desperate measures, but the time has come to abandon that ramshackle strategy and play the long game.

I'm looking forward to the day when someone can say: "I could have been a different person, but I like being like this and doing what I do, and I have every right to be this way and do these things, or to be a different way and do different things tomorrow if I so choose" and have that statement affirmed by mainstream society. This news story takes us one step closer to the reckoning that will bring that about.

I hope you're right and I'm wrong.

Wait, anti-gay people talk about gay people like they're _vampires?_ That's the prevalent metaphor? And it isn't laughable? _"Being turned,"_ seriously?

Sorry for the disbelief, I'm just not exposed to this rhetoric much.

EDIT: I mean, I understand that there is some history to this association, via Stoker. But that's a symbolic association, not a literal one.

It's taking the symbolic for the literal here, with such gusto, that has me so astounded.

In part. The hate, that's the other thing that astounds me.

(Sorry for the double post, couldn't find a way to edit the first.)
