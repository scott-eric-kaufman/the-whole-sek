My [new column](http://www.avclub.com/article/orange-new-black-demonstrates-importance-contiguit-205793) is up! And the title of it references a beloved [Internet Tradition](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/i-recognize-i-c.html)!

Sample:

What had, minutes earlier, been an audition for the role of “child” in a production of “family” has transformed into one for the role of “cog” in “drug enterprise.” The confusion created by placing these scenes back-to-back will resonate throughout the season, as Taystee must decide whether Vee is a caring mother figure or an exacting boss. Initially, at least, she seems to understand the difference—but as the episode progresses, the amount of emotional energy she invests in acquiring a job becomes increasingly excessive, making the stitching of these two scenes together seem increasingly meaningful.
