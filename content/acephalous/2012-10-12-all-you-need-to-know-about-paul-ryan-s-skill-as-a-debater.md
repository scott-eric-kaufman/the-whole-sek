When you debate competitively there are some issues you know not to address. There are others you know to better than to pursue. Then there are those that must be avoided at all costs—that must not even be mentioned lest your loss become an object lesson in unwitting self-immolation. Whether Ryan’s handlers wanted to watch him burn or Ryan was simply too stupid to recognize the brutal inefficacy of his anecdote matters less than the fact that he said it with his “honest face” to Joe Biden’s actual one:

> **RYAN:** Mitt Romney’s a car guy. They keep misquoting him, but let me tell you  about the Mitt Romney I know. This is a guy who I was talking to a  family in Northborough, Massachusetts the other day, Sheryl and Mark  Nixon. Their kids were hit in a car crash, four of them. Two of them,  Rob and Reed, were paralyzed.

The one thing you don’t address—the one you know better than to pursue—the one that must be avoided at all costs—the one that must not even be mentioned in a debate with Joe Biden is _a tragic car accident_.  The attempt to elicit sympathy for Romney by anecdotal proxy is a poor enough of a play. The decision to do so via an anecdote about a tragic car accident _in a debate with Joe Biden_ means you’re either a sociopath or possessed of an idiocy of immeasurable power.

I hooted at the TV until the neighbor's dog started barking.  He \*must\* have discussed this anecdote with at least a couple other people while preparing for the debate.  How could they have thought it was a good idea?

I’m going with sociopath. It could well have been a deliberate choice to try to derail Biden.
