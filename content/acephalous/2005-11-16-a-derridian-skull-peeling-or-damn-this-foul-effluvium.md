## A Derridian Skull-Peeling; or, Damn This Foul Effluvium!

[_X-posted on every other blog in the entire blogosphere, except for_ that _one, you know._]

Walter Benn Michaels brings out the weird in everyone.  What do I mean?  In academia, he is considered Anti-Christ by the Theory crowd, even though the manner in which he engages Theory is, by any reasonable definition, "theoretical."  His shrewd readings of Derrida do to Him what He did to Rousseau and Plato, _i.e._ he addresses the argument on its own terms and grants all its assumptions.  Then he nabs the bat it brought to beat him and beats it insensate.  Just like Derrida did.  Despite siding with the Searle camp on matters Limited & Incorporated and the Michaels on material matters, I admire the tactical mind of Derrida and am reminded of it more the more I read Michaels.  Though he shuns the conclusions Derrida drew, Michaels imbided the method and the message . . . and deploys it with the same subtle strokes Derrida once did.  

And by "subtle" I mean "like Viking raiders soundly hitting shore."  They produce not light but visible heat.  The poor soul burdened by thermanæsthesia still feels the wattage wash across his face as the fireworks commence.  All of which I say as prelude to the utter deflation of Michaels' much celebrated article in the recent _[n+1](www.nplusonemag.com/)_.  Sean [discussed it](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/against\_respect/) on [The Valve](http://www.thevalve.org/).  Matt [discussed it](http://www.long-sunday.net/long\_sunday/2005/11/beaten\_to\_the\_p.html) on [Long Sunday](http://www.long-sunday.net/)—and took care to note that "even Sean McCann has seen the light" even though Sean probably saw said light quite blindingly when Michaels read [directed?] his dissertation.  That Sean and Matt agree should shock you into immediate subscription, but when I read the article again today I noticed something strange about its placement in the latest _n+1_.  When the issue first arrived I dove into the Michaels article first, then read the rest sequentially.  But when I read the Michaels article this morning I could not help but question the decision to juxtapose it alongside J.D. Daniels' "John Thomas and Lady Jane."  

Daniels argues that the class politics of those who come from the middle and upper classes are tainted by an idealism so pervasive its foul effluvium coats the minds of the working poor:
Talking about the working class in Cambridge is just an everyday gulp of egalitarian treacle, but talking about the working class in Jeffersonville, Indiana, where I was a warehouse clerk for the Department of Agriculture, is a good way to get your skull peeled.

That jibes with my experience.  To talk of the working poor about their work and poverty will "get your skull peeled" because, like Daniels' mother, the working poor have a work ethic and an earnest belief that they have earned the status through their endless toil.  Although Daniels speaks largely to the trendy John Deere hats donned by children of unthinkable treasure, his criticism of those who champion class politics undercuts the power of Michaels argument such that I incline to suspect malicious intent.  But I don't.  I think this unfortunate editorial decision meerly unfortunate.  I would have uncoupled Michaels cogent critique of the classless politics of the American left and right from Daniels' damning criticism . . . but I don't edit _n+1_.

Yet.
