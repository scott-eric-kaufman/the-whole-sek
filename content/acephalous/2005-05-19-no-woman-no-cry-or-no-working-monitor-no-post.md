Posting from Mrs. Acephalous' computer is a pain because, well, she needs it and denies me the time online I've earned.  No updates today, or tomorrow probably, as I'd have to wrestle Mrs. Acephalous' computer from her.  And that'd be rude.  As soon as Dell sends a technician out here, I'll be posting again.  With all the vitriol, humor and absurdity that my 93 regular readers have grown to love.

Mrs. Acephalous,

Are your course papers, grading, course preparation, etc., really that much more important than Mr. Acephalous's blog?
