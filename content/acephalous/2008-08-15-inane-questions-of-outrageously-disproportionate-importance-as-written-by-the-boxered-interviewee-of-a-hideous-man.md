## Inane questions of outrageously disproportionate importance (as written by the boxered interviewee of a hideous man)

*   If you are, were, will or want to be an American and were writing a dissertation in MLA format, how would you cite Figure 2 on Plate 3 floating after page 26 of Galton's [_Finger Prints_](http://galton.org/books/finger-prints/galton-1892-fingerprints-1up-lowres.pdf) [.pdf]?
*   If you are, were, will, want or sometimes pretend to be an American from a South haunted by slavery, sharecropping, and Just Plain Racist Nonsense and were talking about the "corroborative [lynchpin/linchpin]" of something or other, which of these two equally correct spellings would you use?
*   If you are, were, will, want to sometimes pretend to be or ever hope to land a job as an Americanist who publishes on racial ambiguity in Twain's _Pudd'nhead Wilson_, wouldn't you die a brutal social death every time you introduced yourself as "[Mrs. Wigger](http://www.jstor.org/stable/435434)"?

On your last bullet point, perhaps---unless you're seeking a job in the Old South or southern Missouri. ...But that's funny! - TL

Could I be, have been, or want to be an Americanist or just an American? 

How bout titling it The Biological Rorschach Test: Which Body Parts Do \_You\_ See In This Picture? 

As to point two, wasn't lynching named after some dude, who was a judge? I knew a big family in school named Lynch; much was made of it when we got to that period of history. The linch-pin is a thingy that goes on a cart to hold parts of it together; I guess which spelling you choose would be dependent on whether your argument hinges on holding together a cart or some dude. If you're putting the cart before the horse you get to use the postmodern both/and slash, which holds together The Incommensurable. Alternately you can just use duct tape. 

Re: point three, obviously not, because the correct title would be Ms.

And now a question for you: as long as you're fixing and formatting your dissertation, why aren't you coming over here to finish off mine as well? I have pictures and things to be put in MLA style. I could give you .... uh, let's see; I've got peanut butter. How bout some peanut butter? And crackers? You know you want some. Get on over here and do my work so I don't have to! 

Please?

As a former resident of Lynchburg, Virginia, I can confirm that "to lynch" came from the town's namesake's brother's martial law during the Revolution, as opposed to the Middle English [_lins_, or axletree](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=linchpin). Now, as for using the spelling "lynchpin," I know you're slaving away at your thesis, and I don't want to be niggardly in my reading, but that sounds like a pretty bad pun.
