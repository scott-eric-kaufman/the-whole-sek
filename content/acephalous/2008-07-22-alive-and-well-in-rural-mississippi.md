Remember what I said about the internet being carried in buckets uphill both ways during violent thunderstorms here?  

I lied.  

In truth, the internet is teaspooned into microwave-safe bowls, irradiated until sterile, carefully poured into tupperware and carried to the porch, allowed to settle, and _only then_ deposited into the aforementioned buckets to be lugged uphill both ways during violent thunderstorms.

I've a few posts prepared on the laptop, but it's being elitist, refusing to use a damn hick modem to go online, so it may be a while before I post them.
