## On the Materiality of Evidence; or, Can I Cite Listserv Etiquette?

For awhile now I've subscribed to the [Jack London](http://technorati.com/tag/jack+london) [Listserv](http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/London/Listserv/).  The discussions range from typical fanboy esoterica ("What ever happened to the Snark?") to scholarly inquiries into London's sexual orientation ("Was Jack a pitcher or a catcher?").  I had never looked at the listserv's official homepage before, but needless to say I was shocked by this guide to student submissions to it:
Students doing papers on London are welcome to send questions, however
they should be aksed after the research is underway.  Do not ask questions
like, "How did Jack London's writings express [social Darwinism](http://technorati.com/tag/social+darwinism)?" or "Where
can I find criticisms of _The Call of the Wild_?"  Instead, be
precise, such as "I'm including the following stories for a paper on London
and Social Darwinism ... Have I left any out?"  Or, "X says the following
about _The Call of the Wild ..._ Here is my idea.  What do others
think?"  In other words, do your own footwork first.

Now those of you familiar with my [dissertation](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/08/stick\_it\_to\_the.html) know why this amuses me: I'm currently writing a chapter on London in a dissertation devoted to proving illegitimate questions like "How did Jack London's writings express social Darwinism?"  One critical component of my argument is that literary scholars, academic historians and the general public have an unshakeable belief that some thing called "social Darwinism" exists and that popular writers (especially naturalists like Jack London) glean their unflappable faith in some form of pernicious environmental determinism from it.  Only it doesn't and they don't.  

I [![Beforeadam](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/beforeadam.jpg "Beforeadam")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/beforeadam.jpg)would love to include that excerpt from the listserv's home page in the list of general misconceptions that necessitate a project like mine.  Somehow I don't think it meets the evidentiary standard for academic papers.  Then it hits me: I would have (and in fact have not had) any problem including similar ephemera from the turn-of-the-century in my dissertation.  (The current version of London chapter itself includes a brief discussion of MacMillan's advertising campaign for _Before Adam_.)  But for some reason I believe brittle and dessicated 98 year old newsprint to be _more substantial_ than a webpage on a university server which has been up since (at least) [13 June 1997](http://web.archive.org/web/19970613212747/http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/London/Listserv/) and which has contained the text about London and social Darwinism since (at least) [15 August 2000](http://web.archive.org/web/20000815202317/http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/London/Listserv/).  While I understand that the London site may disappear, the [Wayback Machine](http://www.archive.org/web/web.php) shouldn't.  (The Wayback Machine is a collaborative project with, among others, the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian.  While based in San Fransisco, it has mirror sites around the world, so even if the unthinkable should happen to the entire United States, the electronic record of the webpages of its former citizens will be safe ... deep in the heart of the Middle East.)  Anyway, why am I reluctant to cite one form of ephemera when I enthusiastically cite another? 

Why am I such a technophobe?  I'm not entirely sure, but this is something I should think about more rigorously sometime after 1) the quarter starts, 2) I finish the London chapter and 3) I hear from my parents that they've arrived in Baton Rouge safely.  The next couple of days will be deliriously fun.  (Literally.  I estimate somewhere south of seven hours of sleep stretched over the next week or so.)
