## It's just a book about Indian history.

Earlier this week, Salman Rusdie told _[Haaretz](http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/interview-salman-rushdie-is-not-afraid-1.389961)_:

Everybody loves _The Wire_ and I think it's okay, but in the end it's just a police series. I love _The Sopranos_. _Deadwood_, which didn't last long, was a series I liked a lot; it had more filthy language than I've ever heard on television anywhere in my life, but it was brilliantly written. I like some of what is on now, like _Breaking Bad_ and _Dexter_.

Ever since then, his [Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/#!/SalmanRushdie)'s been mighty entertaining. In particular, he implicitly claims that _The Wire_is "just a police series" but [_Entourage_is something more](http://twitter.com/#!/SalmanRushdie/status/125977746353561600).  (I'm not sure exactly what that something is, but it must have to do with the fact that, as a celebrity himself, he could relate to the Vince and his crew on a profound level inaccessible to those of us who found the show and its characters vapid and humorless.) Rushdie's dismissal of _The Wire_as "mere" genre fiction couldn't be more poorly timed, coming as it does on the tail end of Colson Whitehead's [dismissal of genre fiction](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/10/colson-whitehead-on-zombies-zone-one-and-his-love-of-the-vcr/246855/) as an operative category in contemporary literature. Genre only matters, Whitehead argues, to people incapable of seeing past it. One would assume that a magic realist like Rushdie would understand that.

But no.

He'll watch _Game of Thrones_, but only because it qualifies as research:

I watched all that because if I am going to work in this field, I need to know what it is going on. I have been making myself have whole-series marathons to get the point of how it goes. I will soon start writing my little series.

What's his "little series" [about](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/jun/12/salman-rushdie-write-tv-drama)?

It's a sort of paranoid science-fiction series, people disappearing and being replaced by other people.

Sounds like just another science fiction series to me.

Oh great.  A large number of major literature-genre male novelists of the late 20th century have tried their hand at SF while knowing nothing about it, and their works have been uniformly awful.  Time's Arrow, The Plot Against America, anyone?

Rich is right.

Genre may not be "an operative category" because writers don't feel constrained by genres as much as they used to, but genres have _histories_ which writers ignore at their peril.

Rich _is_ right: I don't expect much in the way of innovation from someone like Rushdie who has little to no knowledge of the genre. That's why Whitehead's dismissal moves me: he's someone who knows the history and isn't about to ignore it. I haven't read his latest, but _The Intuitionist_ is one of my favorite novels of the past two decades precisely because it taps into that Dickian paranoia in a knowing way.

Rushdie comes off a cynical opportunist here.

Rushdie's no newcomer to science fiction and fantasy. His first novel, _Grimus_, is straight-up science fiction in the David Lindsay/Doris Lessing vein (famously, the publishers refused to allow it to be nominated for a science fiction prize because they were afraid of it being ghettoized in the genre); many of his novels have fantastic elements (telepathy _Midnight's Children_, the allegorical monsters in _Shame_, the eschatological figures in _The Satanic Verses_); and _Haroun and the Sea of Stories_ is a fairy tale.

He's written some rubbish recently (e.g. _Fury_), but I think an epic fantasy series would suit him.

What would really be interesting is a sci-fi series with echoes of the grittiness in _The Wire_. _Outland_ had its moments in this respect. Why can't Rushdie write something like that? Maybe just as well, his effete sensibilities might get in the way...

The BBC tried to film a TV miniseries of _Midnight's Children_ but their permit to film in Sri Lanka was revoked. But there is an [upcoming film](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight%!s(MISSING)\_Children\_(upcoming\_film)) of the novel, written and directed by Deepa Mehta.

Rich's comment is dumb. The notion that those writers merely "tried their hand[s] at SF" is silly. They wrote the novels they wanted to write, for whatever their own reasons were. That others felt compelled to call it SF, bad or otherwise, is quite beside the point. The extent to which _The Plot Against America_ was good or bad has nothing do with whether it "succeeds" at being SF, and vice versa. (For me, the alternative history fails because his grasp of the real history is too poor.)

Leapin' lizards, Scott, how in God's name does one actually use that TrackBack function? Why, now that I'm on the emails I thought I had this here Internet thing dag-near figgered out, but apparently not.
