[Adam](http://www.adamkotsko.com/) and I adapted our talks from last month into short articles for IHE:
[Point](http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/11/01/kotsko) & [Counterpoint](http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/11/01/kaufman)

I have more to say about this after yesterday's panel, but I'll wait until the podcast is available.Â  (If only to remember what I said.)

how is it there "inside higher education"? i always wanted to know - nice articles, not much of a "point-counterpoint" though - where is "you, Sir Kotsko, are a complete fool!" or at the very least "by Zeus, Herr Kaufman, your depravity knows no limit!" - there is a podcast?

My response is [ready to go](http://kugelmass.wordpress.com/2007/11/01/academic-blogging-revisited/).

Great job Scott; great job Adam. I agree with Mikhail, it was simply not bloody enough.

Hmm, very nice articles both, but I have to say I like your blogging voices better.

At least I know what my function as commenter here is: it's to provide laugh lines for Scott's talks.  First I was the [freelance librarian](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/01/painstakingly\_c.html), then I provide the [key quote](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/i-am-become-int.html#comment-85822976) for this one too.

Not bloody enough, eh? Then how about Pitt's [acephalitic line](http://hotmetalbridge.org/?page\_id=173)?
