Some regular readers who don't regularly read the Valve asked why I'm not x-posting my literary link dumps.  Since I couldn't muster much of a response, I caved.  (Don't worry, I have another post planned for the evening, and it is something else, I tell you, _something else_.)

I.

Thanks to the passage of time, terrorism is now [an acceptable novelistic subject](http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/ny-etterror4798234jun29,0,3907021.story?page=2&coll=ny-entertainment-headlines).  Just don’t make it _Middle Eastern_ terrorism, because according to Brad Thor, “We’re getting Islamic terrorist fatigue.”

Harper Lee, 80, [returns to the public eye](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/6/story.cfm?c\_id=6&ObjectID=10388817)
old: “[In] an abundant society where people have laptops, cellphones,
iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod along with books. I
prefer to search library stacks because when I work to learn something,
I remember it.”

Film novelization is [a dying art](http://www.slate.com/id/2144703), and that’s a shame, because “_Quadrophenia_ [was] surprisingly good.”

Realism must [embrace fundamentalism](http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/theo\_hobson/2006/06/where\_novelists\_fear\_to\_tread.html) or risk losing its license.

The remains Sophia, Nathaniel and Una Hawthorne [all repose now in Concord](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/27/us/27hawthorne.html?ex=1151640000&en=c1d6f3912d9d4a67&ei=5087%!A(MISSING)). 
“It’s very emotional,” explains Imogen Howe, “They know now in spirit
that everyone is reunited.” Being dead, Sophia, Nathaniel and Una were
unavailable for comment.

Few in 
Macondo
 Aracataca [care about Gabriel Garcia-Marquez](http://www.cbc.ca/story/arts/national/2006/06/26/garciamarquez-aracataca.html).  Or they’re unpersuaded that a town he hasn’t visited in 20 years can bank on his name.

Finally, the announcement of [my new project](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/abstractalous\_m.html), an attempt to create an abstract database for literary scholars.  

II.
