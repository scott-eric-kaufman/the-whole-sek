There's a facebook joke in there somewhere. Something about it being horrific Lovecraftian love child of Clive Barker and Sylvester the Cat. 

_I tawt I taw a packing tape cat_

No worries, I don't. I didn't even think to post this until I took shit for not doing so. It just seems a little ... thin in the content department. But apparently people want in on my very exciting life of grading, grading, grading, cleaning litter boxes, grading, grading, grading.

Five classes is _a lot_ of work if you're stricken with the unfortunate condition of caring.

It really is, yes. Especially in text-heavy fields like ours. If I could give scantron tests with a clear conscience, my life would be so much simpler.

If you haven't banned me.  The songs were fine.  Springsteen's B sides were sometimes better than his A sides.  The River is a wonderful album.  Born to Run his best.  Nebraska depressed me.  Born  in the USA, ok.  But you have to outgrow him at around age 35.

Not sure why you'd think I ban you, unless it was for commenting in the wrong thread, which is a probationary offense at best.
