## You won't believe what just happened.

But as I'm a sporting man, instead of telling you, I'll make this a contest: the first person to correctly guess what just happened to me will be gifted a $25 gift certificate from Amazon.com.  

I'll give you one hint: I'm alright this time, if you don't count my renewed rage against an unjust universe and the deep bruise on my right thigh.  

Now, if you'll excuse me, I deserve a drink.

Airport security screening gone horribly wrong due to surgical pins from previous encounters with moving objects?

You were playing soccer with the Spanish-speaking-slam-poet and missed an easy dive for the ball, thus losing 2-1 in the 84th minute of the game?

Somehow, I managed to skip the entire section about the thigh and everything on my first go.  Sorry about that.

The bruise on the thigh is the giveaway: a googly flew up higher from off to leg than you anticipated, came off the shoulders of your bat and caught you painfully above the pad.

Since the bruise is on your _right_ thigh, I can also deduce that you were attempting a reverse sweep.

The hit-by-a-car people had it right, but were lacking a crucial detail: I was hit by a car while walking to the supermarket.  Again.  (The [grisly details](http://acephalous.typepad.com/035.JPG).)  So, yes, the whole story will be told, true to form, once I'm convinced the universe isn't out to get me and don't wanna die.

This is clearly a sign that you should not be doing any more grocery shopping.

Dude, how boring.  You want sympathy and everything because you got hit by a car again?  Well, we demand variety!  Only if you get hit by something new and interesting will we respond with anything but a yawn.

Seriously, was it the same parking lot?  Maybe you really should avoid that area, which sounds like it's badly designed, or something.
