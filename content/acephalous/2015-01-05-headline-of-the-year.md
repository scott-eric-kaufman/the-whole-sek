I know 2015 is only five days old, but I really think [this one's going to be a contender](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2015/01/dead-grandmother-dream-causes-florida-man-to-snap-and-destroy-spiritual-girlfriends-car/).

And lest you think that that headline wrote itself, consider _The Daily Mail_'s [version](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2896988/Man-trashes-psychic-girlfriend-s-car-rage-predicted-dream-grandmother-performing-sex-act-him.html) based on my story.
