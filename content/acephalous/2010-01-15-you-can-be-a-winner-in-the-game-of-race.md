Sarah Palin's latest [pronouncement](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,582924,00.html):
And
that double standard is—and that hypocrisy is another reason why so
many Americans are quite disgusted with the political games that are
played, not only on both sides of the aisle, but in this case, on the
left wing, what they are playing with this game of racism and kind of
letting Harry Reid's comments slide, but having crucified Trent Lott
for essentially along the same lines[.]

Harry Reid stated a
political reality that only shocked people who are paid to feign shock:
that Americans find black people with lighter skin tones who sound
white are more likely to be elected than, say, [Frank Pembleton](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0\_VBVXuyCM#t=2m14s), possibly the greatest character in the history of television. It's a 
sad

truth that having dark skin and sounding different from white people
impacts a candidate's electability, but it's a truth nonetheless. What
Trent Lott said—what Palin believes to be "essentially along the same
lines" of Reid's lamentable political truth—was that he was proud that
Mississippi supported a segregationist candidate, and that the if the
rest of the country had "followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all
these problems over all these years, either." Moreover, _to this day_
Lott hasn't explained what exactly "all these problems" that would've
been avoided had blacks been kept in their place actually are.

So,
for Palin, acknowledging a sad political reality is the equivalent of
wishing that the Civil Rights Movement had never happened because, for
Palin, _racism is a game_. Not only is it a game, she
unwittingly confesses that she and her fellow Republicans are currently
very much playing it by themselves, and are annoyed that the Democrats
refuse to play along by "kind of letting Harry Reid's comments slide."
She wants to play Race because _just this once_, she believes
her team can win. Is it any wonder the large majority of non-white
Americans find her and her party reprehensible?

Good post.  Matt Yglesias also had a [good take](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/01/identity-politics-for-white-people.php#comments) on this, along similar lines as yours: he pointed out that Palin doesn't actually state what she thinks of Lott's comments, or Reid's—are they innocuous and misunderstood? are they hateful?—but only cares about what sort of hay is made from them.  She's not at all interested in _racial_ double standards, only political ones.
