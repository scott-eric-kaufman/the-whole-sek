## Too Hot for Jack_London

Early last week, someone on the Jack\_London listserv complained about "struggling through" some of London's later works.  He asked whether they were the product of a once-talented drunkard pumping out hack-work.  This is not, for the record, an unreasonable characterization of late-period London.  He may not have been a drunk, but few would oppose the idea that as his debts mounted, he began to churn out mediocre work.  I mean, every London scholar worth his or her salt knows he paid Sinclair Lewis for story ideas.  

Another member of the listserv said as much, then added that "there is nothing to be gained by struggling through the crap."  The listserv _exploded_.  An email entitled "Crap Criticism" shot into my inbox and demanded he provide the gathering mob "with a bibliography of his or her published books and stories so we may examine 
them and determine what their professional writing and critical credentials are."  Fellow torch-bearers sputtered congratulations: 
"You tell him!"

"Well done!"

"Martin Eden!"

After a brief interlude in which people debated the vulgarity of the word "crap," the original nay-naysayer returned to object again.  I paraphrase: 
To call supremely terrible work written solely for money "crap" offends my scholarly sensibility!

Now I quote _with emphasis_:
Otherwise we have only opinion, _perhaps useable on a blog_ or over beers at 
Heinold's, but not useful in a serious London discussion website ... I asked for the credentials of the crap-sayers because few, if any, of them 
have ever written creatively and therefore know nothing of the creative writing 
process.

Confused by the use of the word "website" to refer to a discussion on a listserv?  You're not alone.  Had this statement been made in a film like _CNN_ or _ESPN_—you know, one which didn't complain about the accuracy of a particular claim or question the authority of the person who made it—I might have let it slide.  Couple that with the fact that my contribution has been deemed "unsuitable" by the list-moderator and you see why I must stick to my guns and post my crap-saying on my blog:
Credentials don't make the critic, as I'm sure the St. Grottlesex-prepped, Ivy-educated London would agree.  While I may not use the word "crap" to describe some of London's work, I would venture the following: "philosophically unsophisticated," "didactic," 
"overwrought," and "egomaniacal." 

Despite not having an extensive record of publication, I think myself capable of defending each of those terms.  For the first, I'd discuss the cultural Lamarckism of _Call of the Wild_ and _White Fang_;  the second, any of the relatively frequent discussions of Darwin or Spencer (this would, obviously, dovetail neatly with my discussion of the first); the third, almost anything from the closing chapters of _The Iron Heel_; and the fourth, well, how many times do must you rewrite an idealized version of your own life before someone calls 
you "egomaniacal"?

That said, I find London's work fascinating, oftentimes for the very same reasons I find it, say, philosophically unsophisticated.  He struggled with the regnant 
philosophy of the waning _fin-de-siecle_ in a compelling (if not coherent) manner, and his attempt to turn them into narratives—sometimes successfully, sometimes not—is something to marvel at.  But to say this is _not_ to say, for example, that I think everyone could benefit from reading _Before Adam_.

Do people ever demand credentials when you praise an author?

Depends on the author.  Unqualified praise of Jack London might do it.

Yeah, there's never any flame wars in blog comment boxes.

Dooood, what do those people think of Ishmael Reed's _Japanese by Spring_?  (I think it's a secret homage to London's "crap era.")  Or Colleen Lye's _America's Asia_?
