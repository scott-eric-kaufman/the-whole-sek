More photos of Southern débutantes reenacting scenes from John Keats' "Ode on a Grecian Urn" in front of giant cypress trees dripping with Spanish moss during the Great Depression!

Someday soon I'll explain my sudden infatuation with Keats' "Ode on a Grecian Urn."

In the meantime, feel free to hazard insulting guesses like:
"He's become a raving asthete!"

"Literature finally went to his head!"

"He ate pancakes!"

All kidding aside, the Keats research which turned up these oddities works nicely as the capstone to my current chapter.  I can finish off Mitchell with his love of and slavish imitation to Keats, then move on to something new ...

Prepositional phrases, too, as that sentence doesn't have _nearly_ the required number.

Also, so long as I'm complaining about my own post, let me add that I should've cropped the photos expertly, _i.e._ so that those horrid dotted lines weren't still visible.  

_And_ I should've done more with these beauties.  I mean, seriously: _They're débutantes reenacting Romantic poetry at the height of the Great Depression!_  That post should've been overbrimming with bad puns, worse jokes and offensive innuendo.  What have I become?

What will become of me!

Well, there went the already-tenuous grasp I had on the concept of ekphrasis... (A comment from someone who just spent the last few hours in her office in Murray Krieger Hall. How terribly meta.)

Those cuties are truth.  And there's truth in cuties.  That's all ye know on earth etc. etc.

First of all, I'm having trouble figuring out which of these is the "Death Bed Edition," and which are merely the drafts, which were then corrected by Ezra Pound.

I'm also troubled by a seeming opposition between the beauty of these pictures, which is frozen and atemporal, and life itself, which is destined to decay.
