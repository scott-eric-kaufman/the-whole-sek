## Jonah Goldberg “traffick[s] in an old theory that was perfectly within the bounds of intellectual discourse not very long ago”

That theory being, of course, that what he says matters.

It doesn’t.

But what’s frightening is that in [this isolated case](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/05/thank-you-jonah-goldberg-for-this-new-internet-tradition), he may be right. (In all others? [_Not so much_](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/05/niall-ferguson-making-spontaneous-homophobic-remarks-about-keynes-since-1999).) After trying to apply our new Internet Tradition to what Republicans said on the Sunday talk shows, it occurr_e_d to me that a weapon this dangerous can’t be allowed to fall into conservative’s grasp.

The power of Peak Exculpation must remain in our scheming hands and our mocking hearts _for all eternity_.
 Imagine if conservatives realized that they could say anything they 
wanted so long as someone followed with a note that they were _merely_
 “trafficking in an old theory that was perfectly within the bounds of 
intellectual discourse not very long ago”? That can’t become acceptable.

Sadly, given Jonah’s ability to influence conservative “scholars,” 
I’m sure it’ll become more than acceptable — it’ll become the excuse _du jour_ among the professionally wrong. It’s not _their_ fault
 they’re old and white and male, so how can they be held accountable for
 “trafficking in an old theory that was perfectly within the bounds of 
intellectual discourse not very long ago.”

If you have an issue with their obsolete positions, take it up with Father Time, Jefferson Davis and The Patriarchy.

**NOTE:** Someone who knows how to use the Twitter 
machine better than I should show @JonahNRO the power of his despicable 
phrase. Start a clever #hashtag and all. I’m just saying!
