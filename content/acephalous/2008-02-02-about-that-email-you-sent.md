## About that Email You Sent ...

I didn't read it.  I want to apologize to Andrew, Scrumptious, Hugo, Jason, Theresa, Other Jason, and all the other people whose missives I'll discover after hacking through the dense thicket of spam created by the switch from laptop to desktop.  (Exported settings didn't import; entire accounts were flagged as suspicious; the spam folder nested in archived mail; &c.)  

Promise I'm not ignoring you.  (May take me a few more days to reply, though, what with all the hacking.)

My spam filter snagged seven pieces of business mail. It would have cost me about $150-200 if I hadn't caught it in time. It actually cost me $10.

Scott's spam Email box:

1.  From registrar@uci.edu:

Dear Mr. Kaufman,

It has come to our attention that you have apparently not registered for classes in the upcoming semester.  This is probably due to some registrations that inadvertently got lost in our computer system within the last month, so as a matter of policy we are reinstating anyone who replies to these warning Emails.

If you don't reply, we will assume that you no longer wish to be a student at UCI.

Regards, [etc etc]

2. From library@uci.edu:

Mr. or Ms. Kaufman,

The Langston library has recently discovered an overpayment of your library fines.  According to our records, you are owed the amount of:

$2,000,002.34

in refunds.  This is a computer-generated message,   

and the amount calculated will be automatically  

deposited in your university account on reply.

Regards, [etc etc]

3.  From aliens@cygni.interstellarfederation.gov:

To Whom It May Concern,

This Email message may appear to be a joke, but please read on.  To prove its bona fides, we have attached a file that contains an easily understandable cure for most human diseases -- show this file to any medically trained researcher and it will immediately become apparent that these cures will work, and could have only come from a non-terrestrial civilization.

Although it strains credulity, you have been contacted by such a civilization.  We don't expect you to believe this, but look at the file, and have a trained person look it.  That should convince you.

We can only expend the energy to insert this communication into your Internet system once.  If it succeeds, the file contains instructions for future, easy contact.  If it fails, your civilization will never again be contacted by us.  Unfortunately, we can't control the recipient of the message, but hope that whoever receives it will not let this chance, which will only happen once in the history of your planet, go to waste.

Very best regards, [etc etc]

Scott, no need to reply to mine.  If that helps.

Dear Scott: Suzi and me will be screwing on your desk this afternoon. If that's not OK, please contact me.

Hey Scott, I e-mailed you a couple of weeks ago to say that I'd be commenting under another name. But I never did comment under that name, and now I see that someone else is commenting under the name I was going to use. Weird.

Anyway, I'll have to think more carefully about what name to use now.
