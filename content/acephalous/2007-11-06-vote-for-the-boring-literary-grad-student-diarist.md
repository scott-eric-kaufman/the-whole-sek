## Vote for the Boring Literary Grad Student Diarist!

Chuck—resident scribe at [_From My Position ... On the way!_](http://tcoverride.blogspot.com/)—[characterizes _Acephalous_ thus](http://2007.weblogawards.org/polls/best-of-the-top-2501-3500-blogs-1.php):
**Everyday me, life as it happens...** 

  

My
husband and I went on our coffee date this morning about 6:00 a.m. We
came home and we both did a little blogging and Mike did some chatting
while I did some laundry and sat down with my cookbooks. I came up with
a menu that would last us until nearly the end of the month (minus the
holiday trimmings). I then sorted through our pantry and fridge to see
what was there and started writing out our grocery list. For the first
time ever, I took the grocery list and sorted it by aisle ...

I couldn't find the post he quoted—a _polite_ competitor would've included a link—nor do I remember a 6 a.m. coffee date with a man named Mike (or doing his laundry) (or reading his cookbooks) (or coming up with menus) (or sorting through my pantry), but I like this idea I had about sorting the grocery list by aisle.  Do you know how many calories I waste traipsing back to aisles I've already covered?  The last time I went to the supermarket, I double-backed to the cereal aisle no less than fifteen times.  That's almost 10,000 calories I could've used folding Mike's laundry!  

(Why put the coffee with the cereal?  Just because they're both breakfast foods?  Because they're not.  People drink coffee all day.  I'm drinking coffee _right now_.  I ground the beans myself this morning.  They say there's no coffee like freshly ground coffee, and let me tell you: they are correct.  This is the best cup of coffee I've had since yesterday afternoon, when I snuck a little Kona into my normal blend.  Kona's been my favorite coffee for a long time because it reminds me of Hawaii.  Not that I've been to Hawaii, but I've always dreamed of going, and I imagine when I get there it will smell like Kona.  So despite the chill that settled over Southern California yesterday, I drank coffee that reminds me of what I've long thought Hawaii will smell like.  It was a wonderful day.)  

I'm glad I had the idea to sort the grocery list by aisle.  I only wish I'd remembered having that idea, that way I wouldn't have wasted all the calories I've wasted since I forgot I had it.  But enough about me.  Chuck asked:
Wait, I am in the running with this? Am I this dull?

The answer to the first question should be self-evident.  As to the second: does it get any more exciting than [this](http://tcoverride.blogspot.com/2007/10/lazy.html)?  I'm forced to conclude, Chuck, that you _are_ that dull.

Then there's this "[Jack's Shack](http://wwwjackbenimble.blogspot.com/2007/11/things-you-need-to-know.html)" Jew, who complains about how little smack talk is flying.  This Jew's about [as Jewish as they come](http://wwwjackbenimble.blogspot.com/2007/11/how-to-handle-cell-phone-in-restaurants.html).  His blog roll consists entirely of Jew blogs: _Israel_ this, _Rabbi_ that, _What-to-do-with-the-Blood-of-Christian-Children_ the other.  (Two of the Jew's links consist solely of the name "Miriam"!)  He writes exclusively about the Jews and [what is good for them](http://wwwjackbenimble.blogspot.com/2007/11/thank-you-mother-in-israel.html).  The blog [oozes Jew](http://wwwjackbenimble.blogspot.com/2007/11/demise-of-bagel-nosh.html).  Who would want to vote for the Jew?  Don't vote Jew.    

[Vote for me](http://2007.weblogawards.org/polls/best-of-the-top-2501-3500-blogs-1.php) instead.  (Remember!  You!  Can!  Vote!  Once!  A!  Day!)  

I know I'll never catch [the hippie](http://faultline.org/index.php/site/comments/civic\_duties\_and\_cetera/), but I can at least overtake Chuck.

Smack talk is still weak. I only have 17 readers and I am still in this contest woohoo. Just for kicks read my post about me and the [Nigerian scammers](http://wwwjackbenimble.blogspot.com/2006/02/give-me-time-and-i-will-be-rich-rich.html).

Chuck is right about something, Irvine has to be among the dullest places on earth.

My friend, you are HANDING the freepers bullets. Are you trying to have a rightwing experience less pleasant than [certain recent unpleasantness, specifics redacted] so you can feel good aboot being on the left side of the canyon again?

Anyway, take a gander at Chuck's "before you get mad read this" link. This is the competition?

Jack, I'd expect you'd say that ... just like a Jew.

Chris, you've got this thing wrapped up!  You're coasting to the finish line.  _I_ just want to beat Chuck.  

(And the Jew.)  

(But mostly Chuck.)

From the rest of that post:

"Since I am neither, that is a Black moderate or a black conservative, I don't get this website. Then again, it isn't for me. Sorry for the niggardly commentary, but I don't have much to say."

Pun on "niggardly"! Double hi-five!

That's it. I am going to have sex in your office and this time I can assure you we'll win the sexual harrassment case. Because you do have a history of this kind of thing.

I do, I do, Jack ... but I also have a history of beating all raps.  Just FYI, you know.

Joe, that's the stuff my ten-foot pole recoiled at.  I would've addressed it, but, you know, my ten-foot pole recoiled.  Thought it best void.

i meant "scott" of course - sorry - so apparently one can also vote using different computers which is clearly cheating and is an immoral practice unless it's something really important like winning a battle of blogs, but still very very wrong - only a depraved and twisted mind would think of, say, going to the library and voting from all the computers there! how ungodly and just plain dishonest!

Chris, i confess i only did it because i was thoroughly educated and spiritually moved/crushed by your graphic novel version of Berube's volume - in fact, in imitation of the characters i now habitually strike socialist realism poses where it is and isn't appropriate...

I can understand how the confusion happened, since he called you a "diarist," which is pretty ridiculous, but "Everyday Me" is definitely one of your competitors, & you were given only one line of snark: [check it out](http://www.angelfire.com/sc/anderklan/blahblahblog/). I expect a photoshopped parody banner ASAP.

J.S. Nelson and Uncomplicatedly, _that_ makes sense.  If Chuck would learn how to space a paragraph, this wouldn't be a problem.

Of course, now I have a problem: what should I do with Mike's laundry?

(And no cheating, Mikhail!)

(Unless, of course, you want to.)

Scott,  

This is funny until the link to Chuck, which isn't funny, and the "the jew" thing is weird without context. But the post prior to that is still enough to win you my vote (and really you should probly send Chuck a bill cuz his post about you was genuinely funny - you made him write a better post). Oh yeah, please give my love to Mike.  

xox,  

Nate

I assume most of my readers know I'm Jewish.  If not, well, they should [revisit this post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/three-grossly-s.html), in which my Jewiness outs like a hurricane.

And Mike appreciates your love ... but I still don't know what to do with his laundry.

I'm curious to know if you and/or Mike and/or Chuck think that your housework is value productive or not.
