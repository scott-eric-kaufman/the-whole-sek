## Idle Hands vs. Damnable Complicity

As a corollary to the saga still raging below, I want to write about one of my students.  (I'll keep it general.)  She's writing about a local "advocacy group" devoted to a cause which any reasonable person would consider commendable.  The first draft of her article outlined a series of meetings in which the members of this group talked about themselves and their spiritual development.  No mention of the commendable cause which ostensibly unites them.  

In her second draft she added an account of another meeting no different from the first, as well as a conference which this group had organized.  The conference celebrated the publication of a memoir by a prominent academic in which she talked about her experiences.  The proceedings consisted of little more than all the members of the advocacy group talking about their experiences too.  Everyone talked about themselves and formed what they called a "sisterhood."  Still no mention of the cause which ostensibly unites them.  

My student arrived at her mandatory final conference with a horrified look on her face.  She sat down and handed me yet another draft.  

"Before you read it, I want to say something." 

"Yes?" 

"It's boring.  I sat there writing and I couldn't stop thinking about how boring it is.  They don't do anything.  They meet to discuss [_a cause which any reasonable person would consider commendable_] but all they do is talk about themselves and how they have to heal themselves before they can do anything else.  _But they never do anything else._  I wish I had chosen a different subject.  I can't believe I chose this one.  I'm so stupid." 

"No you're not.  [_Long explanation about artificial crunch of the quarter system on conventional research and reportage and how it forces students to run not necessarily with the best but "the best available" idea._]  But I see something interesting in this topic." 

"Really?" 

"Why not point out the difference between their words and their actions?" 

"I don't want them to hate me.  They let me into their lives and I don't want to betray their trust." 

"Remember that Janet Malcolm quotation I read in class?  'Every journalist who is
not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible. He is a kind of confidence man, preying on people's vanity, ignorance or loneliness, gaining their trust and betraying them without remorse.'  You're going to betray them.  There's no way not to.  They know you're there using them, and you know they're using you.  The thing you have to remember is that you have a commitment to the truth, not to further inflating their already bloated image of themselves.  You're not their PR department." 

"I know, I know.  But they really want to help people." 

"And are they helping any?" 

"No, no, not really." 

"What if you point that out?  It may shatter their image of themselves, but what about the victims [of the practice the commendable cause would outlaw]?  What about the monies going to this chapter?  If all they're doing is sitting around talking about themselves and forming a 'sisterhood' which makes them all feel better about themselves, wouldn't that money be better spent elsewhere?" 

"Yes, of course." 

"Then aren't you actually _doing them a favor_, reminding them of the ostensible reason for their existence?  Isn't popping their bubble of self-righteousness a good thing, something likely to make them realize the disconnect between what they say and what they actually do?" 

"They'll be upset." 

"_Of course they will_.  You'll be holding up a mirror, forcing them to see themselves _as they are_ as opposed to the crusaders they fancy themselves to be." 

"Well, I have another draft of my essay."  

She hands me a copy in which she accomplished much of what I recommended above.  She didn't need my advice so much as simple reassurance that she should do what her instincts told her to.  What did she learn from this experience?  

A difficult lesson.  

She chose this topic because she wanted to become involved in ending the practice [the commendable cause] would curb.  She thought these people admirable, but through her research learned that the cause which united them only did so superficially.  That it was an excuse to bolster their flagging confidence, to empower them to feel superior to all those who lacked their commitment to [the commendable cause]; but that, sadly, their "commitment" was little more than excuse to engage in a hackneyed quest for "self-discovery."  Not that such things are unimportant, especially among undergraduates.  (They fall squarely under the university's "If Not Now, When?" charter.)  Only that _they have replaced actual political action_.  

The personal has become "political" in the pejorative, academic sense.  My student's disillusion at the gradual replacement of activism with, as she wrote, a conversation about their relationship status and history at Island Burgers.  At some point, the idea of the personal informing the political was supplanted by its solipsistic cousin, the personal _as_ political.  

The slogan's verb, never all that active to begin with, has been replaced by a lazy but "empowering" equivalence.  

My critique of identitarian politics has never involved critiquing the identities of those who espouse them.  Nor has it ever involved critiquing their goals, the desired ends of their impassioned activism.  All I've critiqued is the _effectiveness_ of their tactics, the insistence that, contra to the vocal declamations, that their attitude and actions have helped further the cause to which they are committed.  I would argue that, given recent developments, they have not.  More to the point, I believe they have actually had _the opposite effect_, that the mobilization of these racially and sexually essentialist accounts of identity has alienated them from the kind of majoritarian political action which would allow them to achieve their stated goals.  

I know this a terrible thing to say.  I know that, in important respects, I'm asking people to table their concerns, and that my insistence that they'd be doing so for their own good sounds terribly paternalistic.  You know what?  I'm as unhappy I came to this conclusion as you.  I'm as upset that I live in a country in which the "quality" of political discourse and the realities of the political environs compel me to say something I find intellectually dissatisfying and outright condescending.  

But I don't see the alternative working.  I look around me and see the dismantling of affirmative action by an increasingly conservative judicial system; I see a President who would deny homosexuals the legal recognition of a fundamental human institution on the basis of it being a fundamental human institution _and be completely oblivious to the irony such a statement entails_.  I deny the validity of no one's experience, I only question the effectiveness of its mobolization as a political tactic.  As my previous post makes clear, I wish I could distance myself from the hypocrites whose misogyny and homophobia disgust me and still somehow remain a viable political force.  But I don't see that happening.  Does this make me a conservative?  Certainly not.  A proceduralist, maybe, and certainly complicit in a system which is far from perfect.  But to my mind, it is better to be complicit in a system which is flawed but improving, if only incrementally. 

My hands may be dirty, but at least they're not doing the Devil's work. 

[
Update
_: While I have thought about this, at length, it's no airtight manifesto.  I speak not to convince but to clarify my unhappiness with the political arguments I proffer.  As Rich said, with which I grudgingly agree, some commitments, while "political" in nature, make for terrible politics in practice.  This bothers me, and I'm still sorting out why.  So I admit in advance the likelihood that I am very, very wrong about a number of things, and that it is possible I will change my mind as the debate progresses because, well, appearances notwithstanding, I'm not infalliable.  I'm just a kid with a blog, as likely to be oblivious to obvious counterarguments as the next kid on a soapbox.  If I've overlooked something, correct me, don't dismiss me.  If you can't convince the willing, what chance have you with everyone else?_]

[_Update #2: As I was writing someone this evening, I blundered into a better way to talk about my support of coalition politics.  It's not that I want to support a misogynistic, homophobic left.  Who would?  It's a matter of the base they're forced to pander to.  The misogynistic, homophobic right panders to an anti-choice, anti-human rights crowd, whereas the misogynistic, homophobic left panders to a pro-choice, pro-gay marriage crowd.  (These are just two of many possible examples.)  There's no chance for progress and a high likelihood for regress from the former, whereas there's a stability of present gains standing (affirmative action, for example) and a chance, however small, for real progress from the latter.  The caveats listed in the first update still apply._]

At the risk of alienating you further from your heretofore allies, let me confirm your thesis from the POV of a Right Wing Death Beast. Kos, Atrios and company are the best tools Karl Rove has to keep "the base" in line, and stupid tactics like ostracizing Lieberman simply reinforce the point -- as do many of the comments in the previous thread, however polite. Declarations, and requirements, of ideological purity won't fly in American politics, and I hope they never will.

Case in point: "gay marriage". You (general "you") could have had civil unions on a plate, even here in Texas, home of the sodomy laws -- right up until the Massachusetts decision and subsequent silliness in San Francisco. Had you gone that route, then followed up with a persistent campaign based on separation of Church and State, declaring that "marriage" as such was a religious rite the Government had no business messing with, and that all partnerships for (e.g.) tax and childraising purposes had to be done via civil registration with "marriage" if any in church irrelevant to legal status, in five or ten years you could have had equal status for homo- and heterosexual partnerships at essentially no cost. The nasty, hate-filled shrieks demanding gross modification of a cultural construct by Government fiat has put that eventuality off for a decade, at the very least. Cries of "Homophobia! Gay-bashing!" against people whose real motive is resentment at being required to yield a(nother) treasured tradition at gunpoint make it even worse.

Case in point: egalism defeating egalitarianism. Identical outcomes do not mean "fairness", if by that is meant generalized equity. There are fewer women, in proportion, who want to be jet pilots badly enough to deprecate childbearing, etc. in favor of that profession, than there are men with the same ambition. If you find equal numbers of male and female jet pilots, that did _not_ result from "fairness" -- it resulted from (a) some men who wanted to be jet pilots being denied the opportunity, and (b) some women being forced (by social and peer pressure if nothing else) to become jet pilots when they would have preferred something different. Equal opportunity will inevitably produce an unequal result, because human beings are not all the same. If the results are equal, somebody is being oppressed -- and may not like it.

Case in point: Mexico should, by rights, be as rich or richer than the United States -- it has, in proportion, just about as much farmland, enormously greater mineral deposits including oil, and an intelligent population with, on average, better education than Americans. One of the major drivers keeping Mexico in the Second (at best) World is the _padrón_ system. _Padrónes_ are oligarchs, pure and simple. Because they are rich, they can pass out rewards; because they can pass out rewards, they gather loyalty; because people are loyal to them they stay rich and powerful. If you say you are a Leftist, but you support the _padrónes_, Karl Marx would disown you, and Leon Trotsky would have your throat slit.

But the _padrón_ system is one of the deepest social constructs in Mexican society. It is literally part of the definition of "Mexican". If you collect together Mexican immigrants in the United States, and tell them that their Mexican identity is important and must be preserved rather than allowing themselves to be assimilated into the larger society, what happens immediately is that _a padrón appears, or insinuates himself, within the group, because that is a major piece of "Mexican identity"._ The new _padrón_ will naturally act to defend and expand his position, including giving strong support to the people who assembled his new _peóns_ in a convenient group. So what is putatively a defense of the underprivileged becomes a continuation of the conditions that ground them down to the point where they had to leave home. That isn't liberal. It isn't even Socialist. It's pure and simple promotion of feudalism (yes, I know that's the wrong word; give me another), the nobility, and the Divine Right of Kings.

I could go on, and I think you could, too, if you'd let yourself be honest about it. You (general "you") Leftists pridefully announce yourself as "the reality-based community." Well, the troops in Iraq are "based" in Florida, and from here it looks like you folks are farther out in the Forward Operating Area than they are, and have much poorer communications with Headquarters. Your (individual "your", Scott) complaints sound to me like the radio coming to life, still squawky and staticky and with lots of dropouts but some of the content getting through. We'll know when you get a clear signal, because Zuniga will cast you out as anathema.

Which is what bothers you. You think of those people as friends, as part of your peer group. Like a battered wife, you need to learn that love is no substitute for fair treatment.

Regards,  

Ric

Honestly, your clarifications are only making me more bewildered, befuddled, confused,  I have to say. 

Honestly, I can't tell, at this point, you mean 1) simply not talk about "identitarian" issues or 2) actively pander to the anti-identitarian side. 

Are we talking leaving affirmative action, gay marriage, and abortion, say off the table. Or are we talking about opening ourselves to an anti-affirmative action, defense of marriage, pro-life position. 

I can't tell whether you're saying "the democratic party needs to leave identity behind" or "US academia forces PC issues counterproductively."

Are you merely stating the obvious (bad idea for the dems to push gay marriage in an election year - duh) or saying something else? 

Scott, I'm so confused. I can't tell whether this sounds so awful it makes me sick or so banal that, well, sure, we all agree with that. Or something else in between

So not spoiling for a fight, Scott. Not a rhetorical ploy, my befuddlement.

Ric, I’m sorry it scares you that we have the time to post to blogs, and an Internet connection fast enough to load pages of HTML text. But don’t try to reassure yourself by saying our bosses don’t care what we do. Actually, since we academics do our “work” with ideas, this kind of thing is exactly what we’re paid for. 

I love the notion of the idle rich forming the leftist base. All idly rich readers of Acephalous should immediately read his earlier posting about accepting donations. 

I don’t see much evidence of Acephalous being tarred or feathered, by which I mean losing readers or friends. So your (Ric’s) description of Scott as a battered wife comes out looking like a bizarre and paranoid kind of projective fantasy. However, I applaud your decision to exploit domestic abuse for the sake of a thunderous ending.

I like your analysis of the proper application of Marxism to the situation in Mexico, flawed though it is. (It’s flawed because economies are not strictly scalable. Smaller economies are less efficient, less diverse, more prone to recession, and circulate capital less. Furthermore, the Mexican economy has been made dependent on the U.S. economy in ways which are severely debilitating.) I can only assume that, given your great interest in these subjects, you are working to precipitate revolt among the peons, and seeking to heal the breach here by promoting civil union legislation.

Or are you just throwing these things out because you think that liberals aren’t smart enough to think of them?

Forgottenboy,

By all means, comfort yourself with the thought that your access to the Internet frightens me. The delusion will be useful to me and my allies come November, as is CR's confusion over just what Scott's thesis might be. The only thing that truly gives me pause is the thought that the Left might take Scott's advice and thereby start winning elections. That looks fairly unlikely, though.

No, economies aren't strictly scalable. Much could be said about the socioeconomic situation in Mexico, far too much for a blog comment; several volumes, more likely. I simply picked an aspect of the situation I thought applicable to Scott's thesis. And no, I'm not promoting revolt among the peons. The last one didn't work out all that well in the long run.

If "liberals" -- using the word as a group-label rather than in any denotative sense -- have thought of the things I brought up, they display little or no sign of it. Which is what's bothering Scott, I think, the cognitive dissonance between his blind faith in the wisdom of the Smart Party and the genuinely stupid, cut-off-nose-to-spite-face stunts they get up to sometimes. I know of a man (dead now) who was a medical doctor; he boasted that his training and skill made him an especially effective interrogator. Tell me, when you protest torture, do you wear your T-shirt honoring Che Guevara?

Time for bed. Enjoy.

Regards,  

Ric

I really do wish that marriage were not so bound up in the hands of the state (both Federal and individual state). I'm not real sure what the benefits are to gay/lesbian couples. There may be tax benefits, survivorship benefits, community property benefits, adoption benefits, and others that escape me at the moment. 

I'm not real sure how many countries call it marriage, though. The Wikipedia articles may be titled "Same-Sex marriage in The Netherlands," for example, but the Dutch term is actually "registered partnerships." Most places tend to call them civil unions. While that might still make a good number of the religious legalists apoplectic, calling it marriage really sends them over the edge. And it's not just the evil Republicans: Kerry carried Oregon and the "marriage protection" amendment to their state constitution passed there. Go figure. 

I think that the "civil union" option would have stood a better chance rather than opting for calling it "marriage." That gets you the ire of not just the fundamentalists, but also the Catholic church. 

Of course, the usual caveats apply (hindsight is 20/20, your mileage may vary, et cetera, ad nauseum).

That was hilariously off-point about the Che Guavara t-shirt. I don't have one.

Let me be clear. Politics is not a game. It is vile to enjoy strategy for its own sake where the welfare of human beings is directly concerned. It is furthermore unlikely that a concerned person such as yourself would do anything directly contrary to his own interest, as he conceives it.

Therefore, acting as though politics was a game (in which one could offer an opponent friendly advice) is a rhetorical pose undertaken in bad faith. It forces one to look for other aims.

One such aim might be proving that liberals are too unreasonable to be politically successful, a thesis which is supposed to cast doubt on the veracity of the liberal position itself. Needless to say my view is quite different, and like a proper study of the Mexican economy, a victim to the constraints of time and space operative here.

If you want to continue participating in discussions about how the left can achieve full rights for gay partners, then more power to you. 

But my sense is that you mainly want to frame Scott's original contributions as a departure from progressive thought, an aim which (as of this writing) is based on a misreading of his ideas.

"As Rich said, with which I grudgingly agree, some commitments, while "political" in nature, make for terrible politics in practice."

Funny -- I've said so many different things that this could be referring to that I don't know which one it is.

But a brief note on the story: it sounds to me like the basic problem described has to do with skills.  The activist group was composed of undergraduates, correct?  Well, an unexperienced undergraduate is no more likely to be able to take a feeling of injustice and turn it into political action then they are to be able to take a feeling that an author is really great and turn it into a polished literary essay.  Campus activist groups, unlike classes, generally have absentee faculty advisors.

Which leads into the larger point that I'm uncertain about with your concern about identitarianism.  The "failure" of majoritarian political action is overdetermined.  You seem to be taking a time correlation between conservatism since Reagan and identitarianism since the 60s and assuming a causative relationship, such that the success of one is due to the failure of the other.  Is that accurate?  I don't know if I've misunderstood you.

If it is accurate, then there are many alternate explanations.  To choose one at near random, the success of conservatism could be due to the success of identitarian politics.  Race is an organizing principle of American society, and the success of the Civil Rights movement naturally leads to a desire among the white majority to preserve whatever advantage is left.  In that kind of explanation, the post-Civil Rights identitarian politics makes no difference -- everyone on the left could be resolutely universalist, and the right wouldn't care, because conservatives and their voters don't need an external stimulus to motivated by their racism.  They will simply manufacture the incidents they need.

I also put "failure" in quotes above because so far, what the conservatives have really been able to win is a Burkean delaying action.  Greater wealth inequality does not translate into a political program that's going to last as FDR's has lasted; even now, prized conservative items like the repeal of the estate tax are being swept away.  Conservative bits like banning gay marriage are trying to stop something that didn't even exist until recently.  The conservative movement, and the right as a whole, has won essentially nothing in the sense of lasting achievements.  Which is not to minimize the harm that they have done, but to say that describing what failure means in this context is also complex.

Ric, I'm not sure I follow you here:

The nasty, hate-filled shrieks demanding gross modification of a cultural construct by Government fiat has put that eventuality off for a decade, at the very least. Cries of "Homophobia! Gay-bashing!" against people whose real motive is resentment at being required to yield a(nother) treasured tradition at gunpoint make it even worse.

In part, it's because I agree with your notion that not all cultural constructs be respected simply because they exist: I have not, nor will I, brook a cultural tradition which, say, is openly, proudly misogynistic.  Then again, I don't think this is a "blind" spot on the left so much as a "sore" one, in that there's no simple solution to the inherent dilemmas of even the softest cultural relativism.  That said, I don't see the government acting as a guarantor of civil and human rights (as they would be if they amended the Constitution to _support_ gay marriage) as an _unnecessary_ "gross modification of a cultural construct" any more than, say, I would've were this about the Civil Rights Movement.  I believe there are some basic, fundamental rights that if _some_ American has them, _every_ American should have the ability to have.  It's not a matter of destroying a cultural conflict so much as creating an equitable distribution of legal protection.  (This perspective also neatly avoids the slippery slope of polygamy, since there's no current protection for polygamists under the law.)

Still, and I think there is where my confusion comes from.  This may begin to answer CR's questions: I'm stating your obvious--not "gay marriage" during a midterm election--only I don't see it as being that obvious, especially not among the identitarian crowd.  Were I a terrible person, I'd forward some of the email which has shot across various listservs I subscribe to vis-a-vis gay marriage and the midterms. They want to make it the lynchpin of the Democratic Party's glorious rebirth, and the Clintonian triangulator in me hears that with horror as he envisions another two years of Republican control over all three branches of government.  I think what I'm doing here is casting my lot with the hypocrites, the very people I excoriated the other night, because that's the only way to win.  Maybe it's only because I'm surrounded by academic leftists that I feel this pragmatic centrism so dangerous a position. 

Thus:

Are we talking leaving affirmative action, gay marriage, and abortion, say off the table. Or are we talking about opening ourselves to an anti-affirmative action, defense of marriage, pro-life position.

I'm talking about what you stated was the "obvious" position above; namely, that we avoid issues the Republicans have co-opted so expertly that we'll lose any election in which they become the central issue.  I think this falls under the "so banal we obviously agree," but when you toss phrases like "Clintonian triangulation," it makes me think you're commitment is to ideological purity.  I suppose I may be disagreeing with A White Bear more than you; even though I respect her post and find it convincing in many respects, I disagree with the idea that we should abandon the Democratic Party.  This may all just be a symptom of my innocence sloughing off, being forced to draw conclusions I would've drawn years ago if I were honest with myself about the way American politics actually works.

FB, well put as always.  I'd add something if I thought I had something to add.

David:

I'm not real sure what the benefits are to gay/lesbian couples. There may be tax benefits, survivorship benefits, community property benefits, adoption benefits, and others that escape me at the moment. 

Those are _huge_ benefits, though.  They involve some of the most important decisions any couple, gay or straight, can make: buying a home, adopting a child, dealing with the death of a loved one, and one which did escape you, having health insurance and being able to deal with a medical crisis.  I could tell you some horror stories which, far from being anecdotal, are representative of the problems the inability of having a state-recognized/sanctioned marriage cause.  

Rich:

Which leads into the larger point that I'm uncertain about with your concern about identitarianism. The "failure" of majoritarian political action is overdetermined. You seem to be taking a time correlation between conservatism since Reagan and identitarianism since the 60s and assuming a causative relationship, such that the success of one is due to the failure of the other.

I don't think it directly causative, in part because I don't think that's how societies work.  Even when events "spark" a revolution, the kindling had to be there ahead of the conflagration.  That said, I don't think the conservative turn began with Reagan so much as culminated with him (at least, _first_ culminated with him).  It began with the fundamentalist regrouping after Goldwater, their election to local and state positions throughout the '70s and '80s, the mainstreaming of their political extremism; and it came about, as people argued during the Roberts and Alito nominations, largely because the Republicans had been seeding the lower levels of the judiciary with like-minded candidates since the '70s.  The fact that our VP and Defense Secretary are both Nixon flunkies, that our two new Supreme Court justices are Reagan appointees, &c.  The Republicans have dominated machine-politics for decades now, and they're reaping the rewards.  

It's no coincidence, for example, that all the major e-voting manufacturers are vocal Republican supporters; these relationships have been cultivated, such that there's no need for "grand conspiracies" to alter close elections, since they've built a system in which every level is seeded with _de facto_ operatives.  No conspiracy can be proven because none exists; everyone does their little part, the end result regularly falls in one person's favor.  (I'm not talking about a particular election here so much as the creation of a culture in which voting fraud will no longer be a matter exhuming the dead for a field trip.  Old New Orleans joke: "Why are the dead buried above-ground?" "So they're closer to the polls.")  Without saying that Kerry won Ohio--something I doubt can be proven--I'll say that some of the behavior there speaks to this point: the pre-orchestrated fake FBI terror alert foremost among them.

Everyone: I've strayed into uncharted waters indeed if CR and Rich are nodding their heads in agreement.

Also: I'll address how I see identitarianism play into this tonight, as I'm going to write about Robert Boyten's review of [Eric Lott](http://www.bookforum.com/boynton.html)'s new book, which is paired (brilliantly for me) with the new intellectual biography of Richard Hofstadter.

Scott, I still think that the melding of the point about pragmatism and the point about identitarian politics is muddy. Pragmatism doesn't necessarily equal anti-ident. There needs to be some explanation why it's this that has to go and not some other thing. 

_They want to make it the lynchpin of the Democratic Party's glorious rebirth, and the Clintonian triangulator in me hears that with horror as he envisions another two years of Republican control over all three branches of government._

Well, yes, those are some very idealistic / extremely shortsighted lists you're on. I don't think reasonably realistic democrats think that that would be a good idea. The tougher question, of course, is what to do when the other side brings it up. Nod toward gay rights and try to change the subject or yell, "Gay marriage, shit I'm for banning guy-guy handholding in public and private! Yuck!"

Clintonian triangulation is complicated. At the start, it looked like a tricky left populism. But then, when you trot out things like welfare reform, it's a bit different, right? 

If things are slickly cosmetic, OK. Talk about the astroturf in the back of your pickup, eat BBQ with slaw, etc.. Keeping quiet at the right times about the wrong issues, sure. But what if the dems said to hell with it and ran an anti-affirmative action, pro-war, anti-immigrant, anti-choice candidate. Southern strategy, right? They would almost certainly win, but when it came time to pay the checks we'd written... watch out.  

It's the parable about the, um, rebuilt ship, the tipping point. (John H. - lil' help please?). You know, when is it no longer the ship you sailed in on?

In other words, very few disagree with the fact that compromise is necessary. But this is not the interesting discussion - where the line is drawn is what needs clarification.

I think you're right about this not being the most interesting _possible_ discussion, but right now I'm reading the Lott book, and it seems, if not interesting, at least necessary.  I see his perspective--complete with contempt for anyone who would or has compromised--mirrored in the faces of many of my fellow academics, a reflection quite close to the simplistic scenario in which the Republicans R-U-N-N-O-F-T with all three branches again. 

But what if the dems said to hell with it and ran an anti-affirmative action, pro-war, anti-immigrant, anti-choice candidate. Southern strategy, right?

I draw the line well to the left of the Southern strategy.  I think you're right, that I am confusing anti-identitarian _academic_ politics and practical political strategy; but I don't think the confusion's wholly mine.  It seems an integral part of the debate, at least as it takes place in academia.  I'll address this in more detail, and with specific passages from the Lott, tonight.  As for this:

The tougher question, of course, is what to do when the other side brings it up. Nod toward gay rights and try to change the subject or yell, "Gay marriage, shit I'm for banning guy-guy handholding in public and private! Yuck!"

The answer's "dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge."  I'm all for co-opting the ideological neutral tactics of the Republicans: if asked a question you don't want to answer, make a show of not answering it.  Speak out both sides of your mouth such that words assuage both sides.  Clinton did this masterfully; unfortunately, he didn't do the whole "liberal ideals" too well.  (Or he conned us into thinking his "liberal" was our "liberal," when in fact it was the 19th Century's.)  

Finally, in an ideal world, I would've held off posting this until I had it all figured out for myself; but in this one, I sincerely appreciate the help you and y'all have provided in helping me refine my rhetoric and thought.  I especially appreciate the benefit of the doubt I've been granted here, as opposed to the one still being furiously withheld from me in private missives.  (You'd see 'em here too, were I not the deleting kind.  Come around these parts in the wee hours if you're interested in reading the shit they're flinging.)

I'm not so sure that pragmatism means that gay marriage shouldn't be supported.  Politics is about power, but one of the elemental virtues within politics is loyalty.  The gay movement has been loyal to the Democratic party; loyalty, unlike Bush's version, has to go in both directions.  That's the only way to demonstrate that you intend to honor future commitments.

And pragmatically, I don't see the downside.  Anyone for whom gay marriage outweighs a lost war, high gas prices, the loss of a major city, and the rest of the Bush cornucopia is not ever going to be a Democratic voter.  Sure, many Democratic voters, perhaps even most, are casually homophobic, but it isn't the most salient issue for them.  The time to make gains of this sort is when you can make them just after a massive failure by the other party.

Lastly, the attempt to make a Federal arrangement forbidding gay marriage anywhere appears to have failed.  That means that it's up to the states for now.  It's an overriding pragmatic rule that you shouldn't worry too much about trying to stop something you can't stop.  Just as no decision by us, the Democratic Party, or whoever will keep some liberals from flaming people on the Internet, or keep Republicans from carefully trawling for the next professor somewhere who said something they don't like, no central decision or politician is going to get the few liberal states that have gay marriage to reject it.  So the pragmatic choices are to either go ahead and support it, or if you're in a hostile state, shrug and say that it's irrelevant.

As for the long march of the Republicans through the institutions, well, that's the signature political strength of money.  Along with the conception of a corporation as an artificial person with the rights of a person but not the vulnerabilities, there's sort of an artificial tirelessness.  In the regulatory/professional/media aspects of contemporary politics, there are always fewer liberals than needed, because they need to work full time, and you have to motivate them.  On the conservative side, you just pay them.  Motivation is uneven, but money never flags.  It has limited maximum strength, however.  If the Democratic party ever does get back into power, and if they are as ruthless as they should be -- packing the Supreme Court, using all the new Republican tricks to shut Republicans out of any power in the House, gerrymandering, etc. -- all of that will go.

Well, if one modifies the laws to substitute "domestic partnerships" into pretty much everything where the current text reads "marriage," I personally wouldn't have a real problem with that. There are diehards on both sides that are not going to be pleased unless they get their way completely, and I'm kind of suggesting that they be ignored. :) I don't get the "mysogynistic" remark, I guess because I don't see marriage that way (I see it as more of an equal partnership). 

And Rich, the Democrats have used all of those supposedly "new Republican tricks" before. FDR was the original "pack the court" guy when the court was striking down the New Deal a piece at a time, and the 1991 Texas redistricting brought forth the 2003 Texas redistricting as payback, so don't tell me that the Democrats can't or haven't been ruthless. They have.

"don't tell me that the Democrats can't or haven't been ruthless. They have."

I agree.  And they should be so once again.  But mid-Census redistricting and the various new House rules really were Republican innovations.

To be honest - and I understand the naive idealism I'm expressing here - I'd really rather neither party be "ruthless" in a way that circumvents the concept of checks and balances and constraints on potential abuses of governmental power.  

More than I care about or believe in any political party, I care about and believe in the principles of liberal democracy, and it depresses me to watch any political party try to stack the procedural deck in its favour.  Liberal democracy involves a deliberate laying down of certain kinds of political arms, on the grounds that our ability to abuse our political opponents when we're in power, is simply not worth their ability to abuse us when they are...

I understand that others are trying to have a pragmatic discussion, but there are gradations even of pragmatism...  Commitments to political payback, when they involve erosions to checks and balances on political power, worry me - I can too easily visualise scenarios in which I'd really want those checks and balances on my side...  Can there be a "higher pragmatism", where we also evaluate whether momentarily useful tactics come at too high a long-term cost?

One thing you "reality-based" folks need to do is check with headquarters.

Let me tell you a story, pefectly true in every respect except that I won't use any names unless I make one up.

Several years ago one of my neighbors died. He had left, in his will, his share of the farm to "Luther", his partner of twenty years or more -- yes, one of _those_ relationships, right here in Texas, in the middle of Jesusland.

There appeared, like the snapped end of a rubber band, the proverbial long-lost nephew from California, in a BMW, with a lawyer in tow. He and the shyster went to work in the courts, and if you know anything about Texas law on the subject you probably know part of the rest of it already.

About a mile from the farm was a little evangelical Baptist church, which the two men attended once in a while (one at a time). Scott knows what I'm talking about -- frame building painted white in a grove of trees, maybe a hundred or so members, the preacher also has a day job, Sunday services with a lot of singing from the Baptist hymnal. Total net worth of the congregation probably doesn't exceed a couple million dollars, the bulk of that in the value of land that's appreciated recently. One of the members was a retired judge, and he got wind of the court proceedings through the old-boy network and passed the news around.

The congregation discussed the matter for a while, during which time the court proceedings got mysteriously delayed. The old-boy network can be used for a lot of different things... ultimately the congregation of the church passed the hat and came up with _ten thousand dollars_, which they used to hire a lawyer for the surviving partner. Probate went ahead.

They lost, of course. Texas law is like that. Luther had to sell the farm, and most of the money went to the nephew, who did everything in the caricature except converting it to dollar bills and stuffing it into a sack to take it home. The buyer? The retired judge and some of his cronies -- who then rented it back to Luther for $50 a year, payable at Christmas, and the ad valorem taxes. Luther's living there now. Every year he sends in a check, and every year the judge sends it back in a gift envelope. He does have to pay the taxes, but he'd have had to if he owned the place. It's very far from a perfect solution, but it's probably as good as could be arranged within the law.

Now: is that church congregation an assembly of _homophobes_? Maybe they are. Luther and his partner didn't go to church regularly; they knew they'd be uncomfortable there, and when they did go they were. But the churchgoers -- people right out of your worst nightmares, red-faced, ignorant, backwoods fundamentalist evanglistics, who drive 500-HP pickups, voted for George Bush, have sons (and a few daughters) in the Army, and are pushing for repeal of the Death Tax -- saw an injustice, and did what they could to right it. They didn't succeed. Is their lack of success indicative of their vileness?

And if you polled them, then or now, suggesting some legal framework that would have allowed Luther to keep the farm and tell the nephew to go back to San Francisco -- irony, heh -- without insulting their traditions or sensibilities, they'd agree. But I know several of them personally, and I can tell you that they're unanimously against "gay marriage". It's a _nuance_. You guys are always telling us how good you are at _nuance_.

I tell that story, which happened just as I described it, as a way to introduce a radical notion: that many of the things you rail and flail against are bogeymen from the back of the closet, creatures pulled from the depths of your fevered imaginations as fueled by your ideology and stereotyping. For self-admittedly smart people with a grasp of subtlety far exceeding that of the rubes, you sure seem blind, deaf, and dumb in some cases. Call it "civil partnerships" and cast it as justice for people who've agreed to share their lives, and you'll get their support -- admittedly grudging in some cases. Call it "gay marriage" and you've not only lost their support, you've earned their enmity. And insulting them for standing up for their own feelings is just a way of displaying your mind-boggling lack of empathy and understanding. They are, many of them, ignorant, but education is not intelligence.

Forgottenboy: I'm still feeling my way into a sense of who the commenters here are; I do assure you that a person railing furiously against torture while wearing a shirt celebrating the most prominent self-admitted torturer in recent Western Hemisphere history is something I've seen with my own eyes. Sorry for including you in that miserable category.

As for why I'm posting here, chalk it up to trolling if you like. I don't think you guys are salvageable, and it's incredibly liberating to realize that one can instruct one's enemies in how to win, place them in favorable situations for their attack -- and have them reject the whole thing, in toto, as being of a tainted source. On the other hand, if by some remote chance you _do_ pay attention, the result would be a politics I could support with a better conscience than some of the folks I'm voting for now, so for me it's a win-win scenario. Hope I can be at least a little entertaining in the process.

Regards,  

Ric

"I'd really rather neither party be "ruthless" in a way that circumvents the concept of checks and balances and constraints on potential abuses of governmental power."

I advocate staying within the bounds of legality.  But now that those tactics are legal, the Democrats should certainly use them whenever possible.

And payback has nothing to do with it.  Refusing to use a legal tactic indicates that you're not serious, and that you don't really care about your aims as much as you care about some fuzzy future possible issue that the Republicans have already infringed anyway.  Procedural safeguards have already failed; the 2000 election was thrown by the Supreme Court.  Within the American system, if the Court isn't going to step in, then refusal to use a tactic, even passing a law against it, is meaningless -- the law can be overturned at the next party changeover.
