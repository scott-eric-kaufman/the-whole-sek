_SEK 
 sits down to eat dinner in the living room. His cellphone rings, and  
because his wife is spending the night in the desert, he runs to his  
office to answer it. He returns to find [CAT](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/12/why-is-scott-finding-it-difficult-to-finish-grading.html) on the makeshift table._

**CAT:** I don't know what you're talking about.

**SEK:** What?

**CAT:** This isn't Kraft dinner on my face.

**SEK:** What isn't Kraft dinner on your face?

**CAT:** Your Kraft dinner. It's all in your bowl.

**SEK:** So how did it get on your face?

**CAT:** It didn't. (CAT licks Kraft dinner off his lips) See?

**SEK:** And since when have you been Canadian?

**CAT:** _Je ne comprends pas. Au revoir_!
