First, [Steven](http://racefortheironthrone.wordpress.com/) and I apologize for the delay. We encountered some technical difficulties -- poor internet connectivity foremost among them -- and it took me a few days to edit the random clicks and taps from the audio feed without having us sound like Cybermen. [Enjoy](http://youtu.be/Sw1HojDpk3U)!
