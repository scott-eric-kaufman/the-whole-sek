From William Gass' "The Soul Inside the Sentence":
Forbidden to refuse food, the child may throw up (and what can you do about that, mommy, but buy a new bucket and mop?); punished, its nose bleeds (so there daddy-o, you brute!); it develops allergies (especially to milk), becomes asthmatic, pees in drawers filled with silks, on platters, in planters like a cat, poops in its pants or on the vinyl, has earaches, dawdles, talks too much or absolutely not, stutters to remind you how you've terrified it, or mumbles to make you ask, what? destroys its toys or picks its nose or fights, or rubs its crotch or whines and wheedles, or cries at the sight of strangers, dogs, or beetles, makes lewd suggestions as if in all innocence, at bedtime needs lights and unsettles your sleep with its dreamings, throws up in cars or at birthday parties, becomes overexcited, plays with matches, develops a cry like a shaken saw, swears precociously, spits, has a permanently runny nose, scabs on knees and elbows, dirt like a clown's comical cosmetic around its mouth, holds tantrums in shops the way some hold public meetings, darts into the street and pushes over bicycles, filches pennies, is a victim of inexplicable frights, fads, and manias, is peevish, pouts, enjoys meaningless disobedience or extended sulks, or pesters the grownups like bees at a picnic, but disappears when called and hides when sought, can be sugary and solicitous, docile and loving, yet when no one is watching scratches, pinchis, hits, kicks, and bites.

But all this is equally true of professional poets or department chairs. Aren't you overreacting?

Touche!  But, of course, it's not my responsibility to bear witness to professionally pitched fits _or_ clean their crap.  I can simply walk away...

Not if you want tenure!

Say you're hosting a departmental potluck at your house for tenure brownie points, and while you're setting out the booze the provost and his department-chair wife sneak upstairs and pee in all your drawers. What are you going to do?

Obviously you can't confront them or even bitch to anyone in the department about it. But here's what's really galling: you can't even use it as a hypothetical moral conundrum in your intro ethics class, because that would get back to the provost too--especially since he has all the classrooms bugged. "Make it a teaching moment!" Shyeah right.

Home's a haven in a heartless world, cause at least you can spank the kids. Say it!
