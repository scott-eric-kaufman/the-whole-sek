West of Apartment Complex

You are standing in an open field west of a white apartment complex, with a boarded front door.  There is a small mailbox here.

It is such a beautiful day out.  Why not explore awhile?

&gt; go inside and grade

You throw caution to the wind and amble aimlessly around fields bathing in inspirational pastels swaths that compel poets to compose poetry and

You enter the white apartment complex and begin to grade your students' final papers.  The good ones are predictably good.  The poor ones are predictably poor.  The hours drag like sleds pulled by drunk slugs.  You think you fall asleep when in fact that is what your student thinks language is.  You grab a pen and

_The hours drag like sleds pulled by drunk slugs_

Nice. There's a Chandler echo (minutes piling up like pennies?) but I can't recall it, quite.

I'm so sick of grading I willingly took a break to fill out job applications. :( That's how sucky it is.

Vance:  I remember something from Chandler like "The minutes passed by on tiptoe, fingers to their lips"?  I also think I remember a striking simile for time dragging from Marlowe's narcotic stupor in The Long Goodbye, but my brain is a sieve.

Ah, I had missed this the first time through.  "Drunken" seems like overkill, slugs not being very good sled pullers at the best of times. But, perhaps in spring (or whatever season Californians are pretending to have now) a young Scott's thoughts turn to [garden defense](http://www.helium.com/items/1061070-non-toxic-slug-control-for-your-garden).

Sadly, this reminds me that I have grading to do.
