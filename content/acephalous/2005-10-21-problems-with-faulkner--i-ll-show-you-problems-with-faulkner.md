The following questions (presented without comment) were addressed to the Faulkner listserv by the brave soul in the process of translating Faulkner's _Wild Palms_ into Chinese.  If someone could translate a generous "Your guess is as good as mine!" into Chinese I might could even respond:
**P.21. L5-7:** _How to understand the sentence:_ "I'll plead my ass like they used to plead their bellies and nobody ever knows just where the truth is about a whore to convict any body." _Please explain it._

**P.39. L7:** _What is the meaning of_ "marshmallows with horseradish"?

**P.55. L9:** "…thinking how it is not the heart at all…but our capacity…" 

_What is the grammatical structure? What does "it" stand for? What is the subject and predicate verb of "our capacity"?_

**P.97. L5-7:** "…Even the Armours haven’t got forty-eight dollars  
to much….ye armourous sons. Keep up with the dog."
_Q: What are "the Armours" and "armourous sons"?_

**P.100. Last Three Lines:** "For sweet Jesus Schopenhauer,"…"What  
the bloody hell kind of ninth-rate Teasdale is this?..."
_Q: Why say "Jesus Schopenhauer" (referring to the German philosopher)?  What is meant by "ninth-rate Teasdale"?_

**P.102. L2-3:** "'To remind us of our lost civilization when our hair  
begins to spread,' she said."
_Q: Is this a kind of prayer before meal?  What has "our lost civilization" to do with "our hair begins to spread"?  What style is it like to have one’s hair spread?_

**P.122. L6-8:** "…waiting for the smell and echo of his last batch of moron’s pap to breathe out of him."  _This baffles me a lot. Please explain it._

**P.123. L3-4:** "…his latest primerbald moronic fable, his sexual gumdrop".
_Q: What is the meaning of "primerbald moronic fable" and "his sexual gumdrop"?_

**P.158. L14:** "...with which their eunuch race was cursed."
_Q: What is "their eunuch race" meant? Why?_

**P.179. L9:** "It's a perfect whore's name, isn't it?"  
_Q: It seems the word "whore" is used in an unusual way, it is used by Wilbourne, and by Sharlotte, even refering to herself, willingly.  Why?_

**P.182. L16-17:** "...or the experience of taking human life."
_Q: What is the implication of "taking human life"?_

**P.255. L1-2:** "...from the same dim hill-bred Abraham."

**P.260. L7:** "...money has but one language."
