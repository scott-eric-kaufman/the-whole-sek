On the laptop it was in that folder.  On the portable drive it was in that folder.  On new desktop it is not in that folder.  

Where is it?

I ate it.  It was there but I ate it.  

Did you need it for something?  Hope not because I ate it.

Why would I not eat it?  It was there so I ate it.

Should I have eaten it?  Probably not but it was there so I ate it.

Will I eat it again?  Probably if it is there I will eat it.

You would eat it too if it was there.  Why hold me to higher standards?

Turtledove attack.  Sill obscured by mob of irate turtledoves. 
Window not thick enough to withstand turtledove assault.  Bulwark with
something handy.  Books?  Edibles?  Cats?

Can you eat turtledoves they are there.  Are they not there?  

You complain about what is not there.  Why not accept what is?  Turtledoves are there.

Need chapter not birds.  Birds not acceptable.  Professors laugh
when you turn in birds.  Search committees consider incomplete birds
unacceptable.  Jobs not won on strength of birds.  Annotated birds? 
Plagiarized?  Nonsense.  Need chapter.  Birds unacceptable.

You defend with the dissertation you have not the dissertation you want.  (Or with birds.)

Is no dissertation.  Is birds.  

Please, you revise birds, resubmit, yes?

See, now I selfishly like it better without explanatory cylons: where it's just you talking to yourself; where you are both you and the computer and you seriously consider turning attacking birds into dissertation chapters and then think better of it.  Also:   

_You complain about what is not there.  Why not accept what is?  Turtledoves are there._

I agree with JPool, mostly because it's very Gertrude Steinian (just substitute pigeons for turtledoves and you're halfway there).
