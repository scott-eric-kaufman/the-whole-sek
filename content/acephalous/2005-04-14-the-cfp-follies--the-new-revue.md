I intended to change course this week and write about the CFPs evidencing intelligence and scholarship, but then I saw this:
_Taking Modernity from Behind_

Panel Proposal for 2005 GEMCS: Crossing Borders

Abstract Deadline: July 15, 2005

In _Negotiations_, Giles Deleuze famously characterizes his history of philosophy as "a sort of buggery," the practice of "taking an author from behind and giving him a child that would be his own offspring, yet monstrous." Using this description as an organizing impetus, we invite submissions for a proposed 2005 GEMCS (Group for Early Modern Cultural Studies) panel on approaching theories of modernity from behind - i.e. from texts retroactively designated as "early modern." What kinds of "offspring" does such an analysis generate? And to whom would they be "monstrous"?

Papers may address a variety of modernisms, including Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis, Deleuze and Guattari's schizoanalysis, Marxism, the Frankfurt school, fascism, various avant-gardes, and other theories of anthropology, politics, sociology, psychology, and science. Papers should stage a conversation between modernity and early modernity in order to demonstrate not simply the utility of using modern theories to analyze early modern texts, but to demonstrate how a sodomitical reading practice de-familiarizes, hybridizes, and perhaps eroticizes both modernisms and early modernisms. Of course, we also welcome papers that query the very terms of Deleuze's description of sodomitical analysis and its implications for historiography.

I confess: That's damn funny.  More to the point, I think it's meant to be.  Of course, I'm not sure whether it qualifies as "intelligent" or "scholarship," but it is damn funny.  From the unintentionally funny department:
_Burn French Theory Conference_

The Burn French Studies Conference in Scotland invites papers to be presented at the 2005 annual conference in November...

Love the title.  Not thrilled with the follow-through.

"Query the terms of sodomitical analysis." Now I get it! So that's what it means to interrogate something -- to make it gay. How nice that my job is to go around "querying" everyone and everything I meet with. I'm a natural! It's about time my innate capacity for indiscriminate sodomizing was recognized as the gift to my profession that it is.

That is RDF, SG. RDF indeed. I salute you even as I edge away.
