Since y'all have seen fit to [make](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/how-to-remove-a.html#comment-78495368) [jokes](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/how-to-remove-a.html#comment-78500130) during [my pain](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/how-to-remove-a.html)\* I'm not going to post anything original tonight.  Not even anything [humorously frivolous](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/how-to-remove-a.html#comment-78607966).  Instead, I'll post [_Ladies and Gentleman, Mr. Leonard Cohen_](http://www.leonardcohenfiles.com/lad-gent.html) (1965).  Despite being made by Canadians, it's quite good.  Even if you don't like Cohen, I recommend watching the stand-up bit at the beginning of the first episode.  At the very least, his delivery bears on [Saturday's post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/in-the-comments.html).  Cohen could, in fact, not sound like Cohen, meaning that his decision to read and sing flat may not be reducible to his deficient voice.  Judge for yourself:




Before [Joe](http://kugelmass.wordpress.com/) panics because I've become one of those sad "YouTube bloggers," let me say that this documentary's been lost for more than a decade, so its appearance on YouTube's a certifiable find.  This is no [cute polar bear cub](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBQRfKeIYZc&eurl=), but a verifiable important bit of music history.  Or something.  Anyhow, watch Part One above.  Now that I've quelled that fear, here's the rest of the documentary:

Part Two:




Part Three:




Part Four:




Part Five:




Tomorrow, I'll write about more academic material, _i.e._ elephants that aren't on tables, kittens that aren't around corners, and rings that aren't on fingers.

I am reminded of [this](http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=416), as Cohen's work was much more original than it sounds to my ears now.

Thank you so much for finding this. I am a big fan of Cohen.

I missed this until now...can I do a sort of retrospective panic? You know I make exceptions for people who also create videos of their own.

Meanwhile, Happy New Year!
