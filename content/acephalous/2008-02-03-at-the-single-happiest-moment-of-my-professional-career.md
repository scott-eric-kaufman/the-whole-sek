## At the Single Happiest Moment of My Professional Career ...

Please snap the most [unflattering photograph](http://acephalous.typepad.com/eli.jpg) of me possible.  My mouth should be a gaping maw, my nose bulbous like an onion.  Make my eyes crazed, my surrogate phallus flaccid and flapping.  Be sure to capture my pelvis thrust lewd like [Beavis or Butthead](http://legolas.mdh.se/~adb93tem/b&b/pics/dance.jpg).  (It matters not.  It is the single happiest moment of my professional career.  Your unflattering photographs mean nothing to me.)

I was literally nauseated by last night. I cannot say how long my recovery will take, only that right now I am still a broken man.

So that's _you_ underneath that helmet?  Verily the ways of American foothandwholebodyball are strange.

I'm no wholebodyballer, Adam.

And sorry, Pat, but that was a grand evening.  Spectacular, even.  (But if it's any consolation, I was nauseated last night too.  'Course, it's because I'm sick, but still ...)

SEK, that is no consolation. In fact, there is no consolation. Shortly after that last "pass" by Brady, while my friends and I were still stunned, my girlfriend uttered something about it at least being a "good game" and that it was "very exciting". 

All of my willpower. All of my love for her. All of my familiarity with the criminal justice system. These are what I called upon in that moment, and because of these things my girlfriend is alive today.

For all you Patriots fans out there. Fear not.....I hear the Patriots were videotaping the Giants ticker tape victory parade.....maybe they'll learn how to do it next year.

Like Adam, I assumed that the link was to a photo of you being awarded a simultaneous doctorate and tenured position at Oxford (the Oxford that doesn't know what "football" means), and I was surprised.
