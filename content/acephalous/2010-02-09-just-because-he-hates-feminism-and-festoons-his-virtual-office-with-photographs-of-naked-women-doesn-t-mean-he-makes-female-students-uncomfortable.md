## Just because he hates feminism and festoons his virtual office with photographs of naked women doesn't mean he makes female students uncomfortable.

 * Tuesday, February 09, 2010



On Monday at 3:09 p.m., Donald Douglas [belittled](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/roy-edrosos-bikini-burlesque-nsfw.html) Roy Edroso's feminist credentials for [publishing](http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2010/02/john\_murtha\_193.php) at the _Village Voice_
alongside a link to a bikini burlesque slide-show that a web-editor had
slapped on half the site. Edroso is a hypocrite, you see, because he
claims to be a feminist and someone else created an active element that
appears on his page.

On Tuesday at 12:41 p.m., Donald Douglas [wrote](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/omg-brooklyn-decker.html) a post about the new _Sports Illustrated_ swimsuit issue in which he complains that "Photobucket deletes any bikini images I've ever saved from _SI_,
and it took practically no time for their prowling image-hawks to
delete the brand new cover shot of Brooklyn Decker." Because Douglas
never claimed to be a feminist, his _saving bikini photographs to Photobucket for future use_ and _prominently featuring an image of a topless woman on his blog_ is not hypocritical.

It is, however, extraordinarily odious and, in all seriousness, absolutely unprofessional. Many have been fired for less.

Imagine,
for a moment, that you are a female in one of his classes who is having
trouble with her assignment. He tells you to come talk to him during
office hours, and when you do _there are posters of women in various states of undress covering his walls_.
How comfortable would you feel? Would you consider his office a safe
place, or would you be worried about where his eyes wandered when they
broke contact with yours?
I only ask because a blog functions
somewhat like a virtual office: it is a private space that the public,
including students, can access. It functions as an extension of your
professional persona. I could understand if it transpired—as it often
did when I taught literary journalism and had issues of _Rolling Stone_, _GQ_,
and the like in my office—that a magazine on your desk contains
provocative advertisements that are visible when you read the articles
on the pages opposite them. This incidental appearance of contemporary
marketing tactic would be the equivalent of Edroso's post at the _Village Voice_.  

I
cannot, however, understand the rationale behind plastering the walls
with images of objectified women approximately the same age as the
students you teach. This deliberate decision to decorate with
photographs that stimulate him would be the equivalent of the [seventeen posts](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/search/label/Babe%!B(MISSING)logging) Douglas has devoted to what he himself calls "[fawning](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/from-comments.html)"
 
this year alone.

"If you don't like my fawning," he writes in that post, "don't read the blog." 

Which
is fine for readers of his blog—but what if you were a financially
strapped female student in his course at Long Beach City College? What
if you were searching for course materials and stumbled upon _American Power_—a
blog written by the very person you needed to impress—and clicked
through only to find countless images of objectified women and your
professor complaining that the copyright holder of others prevents him
from saving and displaying more? How comfortable would you feel sitting
their in during office hours?

Would the intensity in his eyes
indicate an earnest and abiding commitment to teaching, or merely how
far he had undressed you with them?

Update. 
In his 
defense
, Douglas offers a link to a [post](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/ed-kain-contacts-department-again.html) in which he claims:
This
is a private blogging matter. American Power is hosted on Blogger. None
of my college identification pages link to my blog. I recommend my blog
for students to read, on a voluntary, non-assignment basis.
Occasionally I'll pull up an academic post in class as a lecture
launcher -- and actually, _**THAT'S A GOOD TEACHING THING!**_Translation:
"This blog is a private, unaffiliated entity that I recommend students
read and display in class."  The mind boggles.

I don't think you're quite striking at the heart of this yahoo yet, because not only does he see it as a god-given right, and as fun, he sees it as the _right thing to do_. Enacting this version of masculinity, and celebrating the versions of femininity that he does, is not just a personal aesthetic entertainment, but a deliberate attempt to influence the body politic in a reacculturation of traditional (and valued) gender roles. 

The version of the uncomfortable female student with which you're empathizing is unfamiliar to him, except as an example of someone who is inadequately, or incorrectly, educated in the "realities" of the world and tragically alienated from her own "true" but distinctly feminine agency. The discomfort which you believe he imposes is a pedagogical stepping stone to his version of correct understanding. It's not an accident or an oversight: it's no different, in his mind, than your attempts to make students realize how bad their writing is at the beginning of a sememester.

Dunno. This guy sounds like a douche bag, but provided this is a private blog -- i.e., not one sanctioned by the institution and not one that's on his file as research or service -- he has as much right as anyone to recklessly eyeball models.

It's like saying that a guy who admits to liking \*America's Next Top Model\* at work is guilty of sexual harrassment.

Minor point: just because it's got naked women, doesn't mean that it's anti-feminist. I wonder if Douglas actually looked at the photoessay in question?

Ehh.

As long as the blog isn't course/work related (ie students have to look at it) what he does in the privacy of his own internet is his business. His students are free to judge him for it, but really can't complain of being harassed.

As Scott points out in comments over at lefarkins, Douglas recommends his site to his students without actually requiring it. In other words, they're not just stumbling across his private LJ/FB: he's pointing them in that direction and writing with the foreknowledge that some of his students might be reading at his behest. As legal liability goes, IANAL, but it seems to me that he's smack in the gray at that point. He's also running a risk with regard to female colleagues, by the way, especially if he serves on promotion/tenure committees.

If checking out pictures of bikini models were grounds for harrassment, every women at work with a copy of the Delias, Victoria's Secret, Urban Outfitters, American Apparel, etc. catalogues would be equally as guilty.

Being a lusty heterosexual male is not illegal, even if one is a teacher.  Being a letch TO ONE'S STUDENTS is illegal, even if one is otherwise Puritanical.

Ahistoricality, I think you're actually managing to land a few blows where Scott did not. And Luther, read in this context, your last comment looks like exculpation by obfuscation. In particular, if Douglas is suggesting his students read his blog, then he's coming very close to "being a letch to [his] students".

I agree, Ahist is on a roll on this one.

The only place where I'd disagree -- and yes, I know that I'm one of those annoying people whose first impulse when they read something that they mostly agree with is to argue with it -- is with the last-comment focus on "unprofessional".  There are problems with treating academics as professionals, I think.  If we accept that he's invited students to look at his blog as part of his course intro, this becomes a plain workplace-environment matter, which should be the same for everyone professional or not.

Ahistoricality:

_Enacting this version of masculinity, and celebrating the versions of femininity that he does, is not just a personal aesthetic entertainment, but a deliberate attempt to influence the body politic in a reacculturation of traditional (and valued) gender roles._ 

Absolutely.  However:

_The discomfort which you believe he imposes is a pedagogical stepping stone to his version of correct understanding. It's not an accident or an oversight: it's no different, in his mind, than your attempts to make students realize how bad their writing is at the beginning of a semester._

This implies a form of self-awareness that all teachers should be required to have, but which Douglas clearly doesn't.

_Minor point: just because it's got naked women, doesn't mean that it's anti-feminist._

But claiming you're opposed to feminism does; so, too, does objectifying women in the manner of a lusty eighth grader.

Luther and Martin:

He does recommend that students visit his site, and he can't have it both ways, _i.e._ it can't be a private, personal blog that he also recommends his students read in his professional capacity as their instructor.  Moreover:

 _His students are free to judge him for it, but really can't complain of being harassed._ 

I didn't say he was harassing them, necessarily: you can be unethical and unprofessional without crossing the line.  I've seen professors make a sport of toeing it.

I think it's necessary to keep in mind that a "recommendation" from a person who is in a position of power over you carries a lot more weight than a recommendation from someone else. Students are trained to key into things that professors recommend.

_Me: Minor point: just because it's got naked women, doesn't mean that it's anti-feminist._
 __ 

_SEK: But claiming you're opposed to feminism does; so, too, does objectifying women in the manner of a lusty eighth grader._

I meant this as a criticism of Douglas' charge against Edroso: the VV photoessay actually strikes me as very much in line with what is sometimes called "pro-sex feminism" which valorizes physical realism and shared pleasure rather than the adolescent photoshopped wanking objectification Douglas traffics in (and gets traffic from, etc.)

I also don't agree that Douglas lacks intentionality and pedagogical purpose. He might not be self-aware enough to realize it, but he's openly and aggressivly participating in a cultural reeducation project. Itseems to me that he revels in the discomfort his habits engender, that he thinks it is a healthy dissonance with a potentially productive end. There are areas where he's clearly lacking in self-awareness, rhetorical skill, etc., but I'm not convinced this is one of them.

_Rick:  I know that I'm one of those annoying people whose first impulse when they read something that they mostly agree with is to argue with it_

So am I, friend, so am I. In this case I think we each have half a point: it's entirely reasonable to treat the academic environment like any other workplace in many regards, but it's also true that we talk about specific professional obligations of teachers towards their students as being something distinct from other commercial interactions.

If he's asking students to check out his blog, and the blog makes it clear that he enjoys these pictures for sexual reasons (and not, say, aesthetic reasons), this is sexual harassment.
