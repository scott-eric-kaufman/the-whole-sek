(_x-post from the Valve.  For those wondering where **[Cerebus](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/cerebus/index.html)** went, I note that my reading Wilde in my spare time has something to do having received **Melmoth** last week.  More on that later._)

I’m reading literary biographer extraordinaire Richard Ellmann’s [_Oscar Wilde_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0394759842/diesekoschmar-20) and, as I always do with scholarly material, I hopped onto [_JSTOR_](http://www.jstor.org/)
to read reviews.  (Were this another sort of post, I’d write something
about why I feel the need to read reviews of every scholarly monograph
I read.  Were this another sort of post, I’d write about how
frustrating it is to not be able to find any reviews of scholarly
monographs until five years after they’ve been published.  Were this
another sort of post, I’d announce that our solution to this problem is
host yet another book event, this time on Amanda Claybaugh’s [_The Novel of Purpose: Literature and Social Reform in the Anglo-American World_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0801444802/diesekoschmar-20).  But this is not another sort of post.)  As I was saying, I was sifting reviews of [_Oscar Wilde_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0394759842/diesekoschmar-20) when I stumbled upon a review of Melissa Knox’s [_Oscar Wilde: A Long and Lovely Suicide_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300068735/diesekoschmar-20).  Its reputation seems to hinge on how the reviewer feels about vulgar Freudianism—[recent concessions](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/on\_the\_power\_of.html) about _literary_ Freudianism aside, I think my position on psychoanalysis [sufficiently](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/new\_post\_by\_yt\_.html) [established](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/a\_critic\_establ.html)—still, I’m baffled by the final sentence of John Stokes’ [review](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0026-7937%!(NOVERB)
