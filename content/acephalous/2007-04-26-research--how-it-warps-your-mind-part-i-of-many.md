When I read this sentence from Jack London's "[Up the Slide](http://www.jacklondons.net/writings/ShortStories/up\_the\_slide.html)" this afternoon:
Each step became more difficult and perilous, and he was faint from exertion and from lack of Swanson's dinner.

The first thing I thought was "I didn't realize they called it a 'Swanson's dinner' back then."  Why?  Couple of reasons.  The first is that I've known enough destitute Canadians to be familiar with phrases like "Kraft dinner."  The second, that "Up the Slide" is a Klondike story, so drifting into thoughts of things frozen is to be expected.  (The story, like many a London Klondike tale, is about the lengths a man will go to not to freeze to death.)

It was not until the end of the story, when the character named "Swanson" returned, that I realized I had spent the better part of the story thinking "if only this man searching for gold in 1895 can make it back to camp, _he could microwave himself a [TV dinner](http://www.swansonmeals.com/50th/index.html)_."

Needless to say, this marked the end of my working day.
