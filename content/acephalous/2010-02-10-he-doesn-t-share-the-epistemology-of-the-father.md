## "He doesn't share the epistemology of the father!"

Take my word for it: you do not want to watch [this exchange between Ron Reagan and Pamela Geller](http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/pam-geller-tries-tell-ron-reagan-jr). In it, Geller argues that she knows what Reagan Sr. would have thought about Sarah Palin _because she agrees with his politics_ whereas Reagan Jr. does not. Because she agrees with Reagan Sr., she _knows him_ better than his son:
**Geller:** I don't think you can speak for your father, because you—you don't even espouse—**  
**

**Reagan:** Pam, did you ever meet my father?She
didn't have to. As per the title of this post, her claim is an
epistemological one: knowledge acquired via telepathy with dead
political allies is superior to knowledge acquired by actually knowing
someone. When she declares that Reagan Jr. "doesn't share the
epistemology of the father," she's making a strong philosophical claim:
because Reagan Jr. believes that knowledge acquired by actually knowing
someone is superior to posthumous telepathic communication, Reagan Sr.
did not. How does she know this? Her telepathy affords her access to
documents unavailable to philosophical rubes:  
**Geller:** Did you ever meet the Founding Father? I've read everything he said.

She has read the _Complete Works_ of the Founding Father _and you didn't even know they existed_. Or _that he did_
for that matter. But he did, they do, and she read them all despite
never having met him, meaning she knows the Founding Father very well.
Because she chose to read the _Complete Works_
 
instead of
communing with the Founding Father telepathically, she must believe
that knowledge acquired by reading what someone has written is superior
to posthumous telepathic communication. This points to a potential
problem for her epistemological position: were Reagan Jr. to read a
book written by Reagan Sr., Geller would be forced to claim that
knowledge acquired by reading that is supplemented by actually knowing
the author is superior to posthumous telepathic communication; but that
cannot be true, as she earlier held that knowledge acquire by actually
knowing someone was inferior to posthumous telepathic communication.

She further complicates matters by [asserting](http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas\_shrugs/2010/02/cain-and-abel-reagan.html) that actually knowing someone _is_ a valid means of acquiring knowledge about them _so long as that person **also** agrees with the person he or she knew_.
Her philosophy must therefore be one that only superficially embraces
paradox—or the word "epistemology" is not one Geller actually knows,
and she said it because she thought it would make her smart.

She failed.

Then she doubled down:
**Geller:** You never met [Reagan Sr.] either. You know, you never met him either.Wishing
someone was not who they are so they can't know what they know doesn't
make for a sound epistemological foundation. It doesn't even make any
sense. In all seriousness, she actually is claiming that people who
agree with a person are better able to speculate about that person's
beliefs than people who merely knew him or her. That, obviously, is
nonsense: I'm on the opposite end of the political spectrum from my
father, but if you wanted to know what he would think about a given
topic, you'd be much off asking me than Pamela Geller.

It gets [better](http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/123189.html). Michael Reagan is getting into the act now.

I took your word for it and didn't watch the video, but I did read the transcript and it is pretty amazing. She sounds like a Brion Gysin style cut-up of Joseph Campbell. Or some kind of cultist.

she's right. "ronald reagan" is a wingnut construct that nobody can see or understand unless they also worship him.  this construct is separate and apart from the ronald reagan who lived, fathered children and served two terms as president of the united states.

I didn't know that Pamela Geller was related to Uri Geller.
