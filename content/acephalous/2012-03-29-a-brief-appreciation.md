## A Brief Appreciation

Watching last night's Barcelona-Inter Milan draw reminded me, that for many people on this planet, the most frightening sight in the world is a 5'4" Argentinian–born the year after the Mets won the '86 World Series–charging right at them:

[![Messi01](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e9601f4b970c-500wi "Messi01")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e9601f4b970c-popup)  
See how his eyes are already looking at your feet? They're not. They're really on their way up to your belly-button, meaning your center-of-gravity's betrayed you and he knows what lies your feet have told. And that move he's making? It's calculated to humiliate you five seconds after you realize its purpose, so there's only one alternative, and given that Italians are famous for the volumptuousness of their gravity, they chose it with gusto:

[![Messi02](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0167645f0ba9970b-500wi "Messi02")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0167645f0ba9970b-popup)  
You would think this tactic successful: share the Jovian gravitational force of 2.58 g that yanks Italian players to the pitch every time the wind considers blowing, but it's to no avail! The tiny Argentinian spits in the face of Italian-alien gravitational alliances, pauses to shoot a look of shame at his "competitors," then continues moving toward goal as if he's bounding over Martian fields. Having no resort, the Italians do what they can:

[![AP120124021615](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e96048b3970c-500wi "AP120124021615")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e96048b3970c-popup)  
Which entails trying to rip his face off. Anyone who wants to complain about the dirtiness of Italian football is welcome to in this thread. Keep it clean, though, my friends, as some players know what best to do when there's nothing to be done:

[![AP120115113967](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0167645f1420970b-500wi "AP120115113967")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0167645f1420970b-popup)  
"Keep your distance, lads," you can almost hear one of them say. "And hope an Italian shows up."

Wow. Didn't know he was only 5'4". I'm sure that's one reason it seems like he is moving a whole notch faster than everyone else.

Following this is a picture of Pepe, a Brazilian who plays for Real Madrid—a Spanish team. Or did you mean Italian in some broader sense?

Barca's match yesterday was against AC Milan, not Inter. Regardless of the opponent, Messi is extraordinary.

As Pepe's more greatly inflicted by the powers of gravity than most players, I'm going to allow his inclusion. (Really, I just thought of that last joke last, and tried to find photographs in the AP database that would set it up. It's Spring Break! I can loosen my restrictions on, well, restrictions.)

_Barca's match yesterday was against AC Milan, not Inter. Regardless of the opponent, Messi is extraordinary._

The game inspired me, I just wanted some good, illustrative shots.
