## Things Thought After Reading Drafts of a Chapter from Last Summer

Do you ever read something on [_Acephalous_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/) and think to yourself:
**_Jesus-tap-dancing-Christ_** could this Kaufman kid be any dumber?  Who ties his shoes?  Is he even allowed to wear them unsupervised?

Or:
He claims to _read?_  Read _what?_  The backs of cereal boxes and the occasional phone bill?  Mattress tags and Danielle Steel? 

Or: 
Who would seriously consider the opinions of a man who dreams about telling a student that he'll regret wearing a Hitler costume to the Halloween party, because if the girl he's crushed on for weeks responds to his unsubtle advances, he'll never know whether it was him or the costume?

Or:

Why hasn't he hiked himself back behind the woodshed and been done with it already?

Or:
He calls those _thoughts?_  "[Ipecac for the soul](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/02/cerebus\_and\_mod\_1.html#comment-62070098)"?  Is that supposed to be _clever?_

So please, _have at me._  If forced to defend myself, I may inadvertantly reacquire some semblance of self-respect.

Is this like a Fight Club sort of thing?

If it makes you feel any better, I had some shit-ass snot level similar charges against me and my ramblings...

Fuck 'em, cause in the end I'd rather live with the burden of slightly justified pretentiousness than with a cloud of half-assed quips circling my middling intellect.

You realize that, as a rhetorical assertion, this leaves readers tangled in so many loops that sorting them out is beyond my poor abilities (see, now you've got me doing it.)  But I'll try:

1.  (the naive reading) This is an example of exaggerated self-deprecation, and as such, calls for reassurance.

2.  (the literalist reading) This is an example of serious self-criticism, and as such, calls for criticism.

3. (the experienced reading) A good amount of the stock-in-trade of Acephalous is self-deprecation -- people read the blog in part for these displays, which provide an authorial persona and a bridge between literary studies and personal events.  As such, this calls for irony.

4. (the psychological reading) The deprecation is unusually advanced even for Acephalous, which together with the woodshed image suggests that Scott may really be feeling exceptionally bad about his writing.  This calls for carefully calibrated joshing combativeness, as suggested by the last sentence.

5. (the historicist reading) Since we know that Scott is currently engaged in finishing a dissertation, and since almost everyone reading this blog has some idea of what that must be like, this is best theorized as a statement linked to a particular stage rather than something particular to Scott.  It calls for, probably, appeals to stoicism.

6.  (the exhausted reading)  Oh, the ipecac thing was fine.   People are obviously still reading, right?

The phrase "Ipecac for the soul" amuses me me more than it should. 

I blame Monkey Island 3.

I am notoriously neurotic about my own writing.  I revise for hours at a time, sometimes the fruit of a day's labor is something like five sentences.  An example of this practice is the 30 or so minutes I've spent composing this comment.  It grew to about three times its current (total) size before I nearly deleted the whole thing, but decided to keep it as an example of itself.  I don't write anything down on paper, because even if I'm satisfied with what I write when I write it, my writing seems to wither with time, and often after only a few hours I'm disgusted with it enough to trash it.  Volumes have been lost in this manner.  I have trouble with anything that I can't delete when I can see my own naivity in it.    

I have a blog which I'm using to combat these tendencies with limited success.   This success is somewhat mysterious as it's driven by both the expectation of having to be accountable to an audience (which at the moment doesn't exist except as a hypothetical motivator) and by the fact that my choice of topics (thus far primarily short reviews of introductory books on some topics that were in vogue in the 1970s) is at the moment neither deep enough nor of interest general enough to necessitate any reasonable amount of scrutiny.  I'm slowly expanding, as I'm right now beginning to work through some books about and/or by some continental philosophers that I've never felt I had a very good grip on, so the situation is hopeful, though I doubt I'll ever really get an audience.

J.S. Nelson, that seems to be taking the whole thing just a bit too far.

Everything that \*I\* write is suitable for re-reading through the ages.  That's why I should collect all my blog comments onto a disk entitled _Rich Puchalsky: Occasions 1998-2007_ and have it gold-plated for the edification of future archeologists.

CR, no, it isn't.  The first rule and what-not...but everyone's being too nice.  (I'm looking at you, History Geek.)

Dragon Management, I damn near deleted your comment when I saw your name.  Glad I didn't.  In my case, however, I'm my harshest critic.

Rich, you forgot one:

7. (the "new ironist" reading) Scott is a sentimental perfectionist, and as such litters _Acephalous_ with serious intellectual misgivings coated with audience-friendly ironic distance.  He _may_ be talking about himself -- and probably is -- but he may not be.  He is not, after all, a confessional blogger, and so when he writes posts like this, they possess enough irony that he can disown them to himself one moment and commiserate (read: _wallow_) the next.  This calls for a confused audience and the composition of lists.

J.S. Nelson, I'd actually read through your blog after you'd commented earlier here, and had I not be _so totally through with literary theory, like, **forever**_, I would've commented on the Barry post.  That said, I think there's a certain amount of comment-box insecurity which disappears once you find yourself in a comfortable place.  Oddly, a lot of the more combative places I'm perfectly fine posting, but people's more personal sites?  I can't do it.  Something about their singular voice being too strong, or their posts meaning too much to them, that makes me not want to sully it.  As for building an audience, well, I think you do that through commenting.  The more eyes you have on your words, the more likely they are to click through and see what you have to say about other topics.  I agree, though, that some kind of focus is required.

Me?  I shift focus every few months, and it's interesting to watch who follows me for the ride; sometimes people reappear after ages, comment regularly while I work through one or another obsession, then disappear again.  Then there are the people who read but only comment via email.  They're just strange.  (Who, _me?_  Calling _you_ out?  Why, I _never_.)

How appropriate, you fight like a cow!

Is that better? :D

Really, can I help it if my brain is wired to make odd computer game connections when I ought to be serious? You're talking to the girl that wrote a short essay on King Quest as epic.

Why did you almost delete my comment because of my name?  Is "Dragon Management"....hell, I don't even know why it is offensive.  Could it possibly be intellectually offensive?  Not a serious handle?

OH PLEASE VALIDATE MY CHOICE OF A HANDLE!  VALIDATE ME!

HG, much better.  (Also: _King's Quest_ as epic?  Share, please.)

Dragon Management, it's actually a clever handle, but the thing is, "management" is one of those words favored by spammers.  I probably get 30 trackbacks a day from some "management" group or another.  That's all.  Your handle's fine!

We're on to you Scott. You're biased against Dragons, aren't you?

And I'll have to pull the essay off my old lap top but roughly I focused on the first two games (though I'd love to do a longer one on the 1-5, 6 and 7 break the pattern a tad and 8 has nothing but name in common, plus 6 could argued as being a retelling of _The Aeneid_, but I digress). 

I basically discussed how Graham's quest in both games fit the epic style, for example centering on the founding of a great dynasty. The first two games also shares a good deal in common with so the called Questing epics. The brave and noble Knight facing trails to prove his worth, then later questing to win a fair maiden. 

I'll let you know if I can recover it from my old laptop.
