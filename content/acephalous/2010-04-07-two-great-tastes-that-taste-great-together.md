Yeah, I could have done without the brief anti-science rant in the middle -- science _is_ a fucking miracle, deeply unlikely given our human capacity for unreason -- but the rest of it's actually very, very nice. Reminds me of [the Symphony for Science](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/more\_autotuned\_music\_for\_scien.php) project.

What bugged me about the text was not the anti-science stuff, but the marvelling over how peacefully everyone gets together at their concerts. Whether it's just a boast, or it's a misguided claim that this implies something optimistic about human nature, it's not a fathomless marvel any more than the magnet is.

This looks shopped.  I can tell from some of the pixels and seeing quite a few shops in my time.

And what are the odds that all three signs would be held by men with beards? I'm smelling a rat! And the kerning! The Kerning!

Actually, given that it's ICP, it really is a miracle that things are peaceful at their concerts.  

Back in college, when my friends and I went to protests, we always felt really out of place, and joked about carrying inscrutable signs.  "Fucking magnets how do they work?" would have fit the bill nicely.

"I can tell from the pixels" deserves to be the new "I am aware of all internet traditions."

_the game_

Not getting it. I get the part about you quoting from the meme. Not the bit about the game, though.

Yeah, I thought Fritz was just making an ironic reference. I'm with him on this one.
