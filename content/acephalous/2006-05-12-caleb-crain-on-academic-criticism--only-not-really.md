## Caleb Crain on "Academic Criticism," Only Not Really

[X-posted to environs [Valvular](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/caleb\_crain\_on\_academic\_criticism\_only\_not\_really/).] 

[Radiating delight](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/bailiff\_do\_you\_.html#more), I read [Caleb Crain](http://www.steamthing.com/2006/05/n1.html#comments)‘s article on “Academic Criticism” in the new [_n+1_](http://www.nplusonemag.com/). 
According to the prelude to “American Writing Today: A Symposium,”
Crain’s article addresses “the conditions of production of new
[academic criticism]; its character and traits; and the figures and
creators who have most influenced each field” (63).  

It didn’t; it didn’t; and it didn’t.

The article’s evident confusion  may be the product of Crain (or the _n+1_
editors) deciding that “Academic Criticism” signals some particular
body of work with addressable conditions of production, characters and
traits, &c.  It obviously does, only Crain doesn’t address _that_.  He reduces it to the small and vanishing genre of single-author studies.  To wit:

In the past few years I have become a fan—something I
never dared in high school.  In love with Belle & Sebastian, Ben
Kweller, the Decemberists, and Sufjan Stevens, I have visited band
websites and subscribed to band listservs.  [More evidence of fandom.]
I have learned about loseless file codecs in order to trade live
shows.  [Even _more_ evidence of fandom.] I have listened to
songs recorded by one of my beloveds before he came up with his
distinctive sound—befoe he was any good, in fact—and I have treasured
them because they are, after all, his.  [_Even more_.] I have
found obscure, probably unintentional parallels between the lyrics of
one beloved’s songs and those of another and I have wondered about my
beloveds’ personal lives and inspected their songs for hints of
autobiography.  If a love of mine sings a song of another musician, I
buy that musician’s album too, and try to like it.

Last year, at the height of my madness, I realized what it
resembled: academic literary criticism of a great author.  There is the
same impulse to collect and reluctance to judge. (76)

Crain describes a very particular—already tenured or likely
untenurable—breed of “academic critic” as representative.  Very few
academics truly and uncritically _love_ the work of the writers
they study.  (I, for one, am frequently astonished I worked through
almost all of Jack London or Silas Weir Mitchell.) There are
exceptions, and they have socities, edit coterie journals and hold
yearly conferences; but they by no means dominate the field, and they
are often considered too _indulgent_ to take seriously.  (The jealousy?  _Palpable._)  But how many single-author studies were published last year?  How many single-author dissertations written?  

A chapter or an article may _appear_ to be the product of an
uncritical crush, in that it quotes letters, journal entries, and in
the case of a Marianne Moore article I misplaced, grocery lists—if
you’ve read Moore, you know their potential relevance—but it’s
uncritical for reasons unrelated to why a Pogues fan struggles to
appreciate [the Nipple Erectors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Nipple\_Erectors).  (Not _that_ much of a struggle, actually.)  The uncritical fanboy has no intellectual investment in the fanboy “facts” he acquires.  The [scholar-squirrel](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/03/its\_savory\_scho.html) acquires those facts _for a reason_.  

Crain’s analog lacks a certain, I don’t know, analogousness.  

But it does reveal why I find the piece so problematic.  Crain believes
appreciation the purpose of criticism, and that we do too, if only
secretly:

I don’t see anything wrong with fandom.  However, I
could only call it a science in jest, and I don’t think I would ever
become so confused as to think of it as morally worthy.  Yet such
claims were made for the academic study of literature in the course of
the 20th century.  _To be sure, they were made after its origin in fandom was disgused by abstraction._ (77)

_There_ it is.  Crain believes that literary professionals know
that their true function is to teach “refinements in love” and help
readers “meet new lovers” (_ibid._).  So to speak.  We defraud
with flatulent abstraction because we know “literature has nothing to
do with science; it is a matter of taste” (_ibid._).  

I know Crain earned [a Ph.D. from Columbia](http://steamthing.typepad.com/about.html), and I’ve looked over the essays linked to from that page, so I _know_ he knows that, as currently constituted, literature departments do not _fail_ to cultivate taste so much as _not consider it part of the charter_. 
I think Crain confuses the purpose of the profession with the reasons
people enter it.  An undergraduate who loves to read becomes an English
major, goes to graduate school and emerges someone with mastery of over
a particular body of knowledge which he or she then applies (sometimes)
to literature, the love of which compelled them to become an English
major.  

Even if I grant him the veracity of this account, his argument still
stumbles over the fact that it is founded on innuendo.  We all _secretly_
want advanced degrees in Refinement and Cultivation Studies, but if we
acknowledge that, the game will be up: “It’s not at all clear to me
that the propogation of a taste for [literature] needs to be federally
subsidized” (78).  

That’s not clear to me, either; but then again, since that’s _not what actually happens in English departments_ I don’t see it as a pressing concern.

A really excellent post. I love those pretentious, wannabe Paris Review, faux Egoist literary mags like n+1 or The Believer.  But as pleasurable as it is reading such magazines, there are certain traps that befall first person journalists (and bloggers, like myself)--mainly that solipsism that compels them (us) to extract from every personal experience or a ha! moment some Universal Truth.  Wouldn't I love to connect my eclectism in music taste to my adhoc approach to anti-discrimination law to my love of both colonial and post-colonial literature and form a oxymoronic Unified Theory of Dilettantism.  But somehow, I don't think there is one...maybe some questions are best left unexplained by superficial and untenable theories.

Then again, the people least able to avoid making weird analogies are lawyers and literary critics. We're more alike than you think. I think I just offended a whole bunch of people on both sides.

Moreover, two of the n+1 editors are advanced Ph.D. candidates--at least one of whom is a very, very smart & sophisticated critic. You'd think \*they'd\* know better, too.
