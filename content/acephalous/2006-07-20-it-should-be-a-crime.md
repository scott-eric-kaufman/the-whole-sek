 For reviews of research on subliminal influence, see Moore (1992); Pratkanis (1992); Theus (1994).  A review by Dijksterrhuiis, Aarts, and Smith (2001) is more sanguine about the possibility of subliminal influence, but acknowledges that even effects found under controlled laboratory conditions tend to be small in magnitude.

That's what I wanted to know, but apparently we're in the dirty-minded minority, since everyone else—judging by the footnotes—wants some general information about the current state of research into subliminal influence.  

Also, I wasn't kidding about liking your DFW obituary.  You see, to quote myself, "[I'm a fan of footnotes](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/in\_the\_article\_.html)."  ([Google Brain](http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hs=dCo&hl=en&lr=lang\_en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%!A(MISSING)en-US%!A(MISSING)official&q=+site%!A(MISSING)acephalous.typepad.com+footnote+or+footnotes&btnG=Search) concurs.)

For Lent next year, I plan to give up reading the body text of books -- only footnotes and indices for me.

I suppose if we keep quiet about it then no one will notice...
