I'm not normally a fan of poetry—some _sapiens_ whose fallow fields ain't all too fallow are born into ambiguity and live contentedly "within" the ken of such conveniently aesthetic interpretations their whole life long[![Pussycat\_1](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/pussycat\_1.jpg "Pussycat\_1")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/pussycat\_1.jpg) .... but seeing how I ain't numbered 'mong them this ought to ring truer than the Virgin's very own words—so I hereby proclaim that even infides like I find the following doggerel infinitely entertaining.  (Consider that your special stamp o' approval.)  It is called "Mother Jones Melodies" and comes from the 18 April 1906 issue of the wildly popular satirical _Puck Magazine_.  To contextualize this moment a bit, this poem and its corresponding cartoon would've been in print shortly after Jack London (already wildly successful and widely scorned for _The People of the Abyss_ and a lecture-circuit-sensation) published his revolutionary socialist novel _The Iron Heel_ and Upton Sinclar (ever the practical man) had published his muckraking of the meat-packing industry, _The Jungle_.  I mention the latter because it sits upon the desk in the cartoon (immediately to the left of the hoppin' mad elfin figure who represents .... someone?) and the former because its composition and publication are (in London's mind) integral to his vacation on the Isle of British Poverty (recounted in _The People of the Abyss_).  But you're not interested in all this dry dusty history!  On to the poem!

The "poem" (subtitled "For the Kindergarten School of Socialists") reads:
Pussy Cat, Pussy Cat, where have you been?  
    I've been to Jack London to hark to his chin.  
Pussy Cat, Pussy Cat, what did he say?  
    "Blow h—l out of everything—smash, burn and slay!"

Not that London would not have said that (or much, much worse, by which I mean yelling "EVERYTHING IS FINE!  RETURN TO YOUR SEATS!" in a burning theater).  And not that London wouldn't have juxtaposed it for maximum effect, as this author unwittingly does in his or her sad shot at satire.  What London never would have done was jump up and down and wave his arms and stamp his feet and let _a cat_—because if ever a man was a dog or wolf man, Jack London was a dog or a wolf man—tell him what someone as important as _Jack London_ had said.  London knew better than to trust a cat.  _Cats lie._ They claim to have not been fed when they can hardly stand for belly-bulge.  They claim to have no water when the bowl (which is not the slowly dripping bathroom tap) overbrims with fresh filtered water.  London knew better than to allow a cat _even one all gussied up in stripes and scarves_ to tell him the who-for or what-not.  My point?  You want my point?!?

Were I not bound the by strictures of the Dissertators' Code I would have to admit that that cartoon and its accompanying nursery rhyme are damn funny.
