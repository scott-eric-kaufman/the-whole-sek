Some of you have mentioned wanting to know what my course blog would look like.  [Wonder no longer](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj20)!  I'm obviously planning on expanding it to incorporate 1) the authors we read during the quarter and 2) more links to articles by working literary journalists, but for the most part what you see there is what I'll be posting on it all this year.  Which is only to say that the voice you hear here is the voice with which I teach and interact with students.  I've cultivated it for more than five years at this point, so I'm comfortable both writing and interacting with students in it .... and I think it has the right balance of "anal-retentive intellectual insecurity manifested in harsh but constructive criticisms" and "cheerleader" to make this and future classes a success.  (Which is only to say to those who insist I'm "a natural" in the classroom that I've worked damned hard to appear to be "a natural" and would on occasion appreciate a little bit of credit.  No one is really _this_ charming.)

All of which can be summed up by quoting some of [my ratings](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=254703) from [RateMyProfessors.com](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/).  Which I won't do for false modesty and fear that others will think it uncouth to inform people of my "hotness," because let me tell you, sitting in this very chair for fifteen hours a day, every day, watching my five o'clock shadow turn six, seven and eight until it circles back to five again is the epitome of beastly sexiness.  (Or is that sexless beastliness?  I'm so easily confused sometimes.)  

The plan for the course blog is that I'll be posting my prep. work a day or two before every class (which means I'll have to complete prep. work at least a day before every class and can thus avoid the scrambling for thoughts and copies every couple hours before every other class) and require the students to respond to at least two posts per week.  That doesn't seem onerous, and because I'm teaching literary journalism to students who have come to UCI expressly to study literary journalism, they're usually more than eager to become the voracious readers they've seen twiddling thier thumbs in old world libraries on television since they were toddlers.  Again, I'll post updates (or email privately if this isn't a matter of general interest) until I've wrinkled all the irons out .... or something like that.
