[_An astute reader brought [the sad tale of Alfredo Malspini III](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/15/alfredo-malespini-guard-shoots-finger-wedding-ring\_n\_2883595.html)
 to my attention, and lest any of you shoot off a finger to spite a 
ring, I thought I'd share some practical advice about ring-removal that I
 wrote up a few years back_.]

There you are on a Saturday night, futzing with your wedding ring because your wife thinks your [trichotillomania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotillomania)
 makes you look mangy: off your left ring finger, onto your right 
pinkie; off your right pinkie, onto your left pinkie; off your left 
pinkie, onto your right ring finger; off your right ring finger, off 
your right ring finger, _OFF YOUR RIGHT RING FINGER_, _non et cetera_. You pull and you twist; you pull while twisting and you twist while pulling all to no avail.

You look at your wife and you tell her, “I’ve misplaced my wedding band.”  She will look at you, _j’accuse_ burning
 in her eyes, until you hold up your right hand. She will then enter the
 kitchen and return with the ingredients required to perform Step One:

1. Apply cold water and a little soap.  Gently work the 
soap under the ring and twist. If the ring still does not come off, 
massage the area of the finger below the knuckle to remove some of the 
fluid from the finger. Wait a few minutes, then repeat.  Continue until 
the finger is good and chafed.

After fifteen minutes of repeated failure, your wife will walk back 
into the kitchen and return with the materials needed for Step Two:

2. Dry the chafed finger with hand towel, then apply the 
following in any order: water-based lubricants, oil-based lubricants, 
semi-solid fats, hydrogenated vegetable oils, as well as any lard, suet,
 ghee, tallow, or schmaltz you find lying around. As with the soap and 
water, work the slippery substance under the ring and twist and turn. 
Carefully slip a knife under the ring and try to slide it over the 
knuckle. If the ring-bearer cries in pain, ascertain whether its source 
is the ring jamming on the knuckle or the knife slicing into it.

This too will fail. Your wife will walk back into the kitchen yet 
again.  Take this opportunity to try to wash your hilariously lubed 
finger.  The water-based lubricants will dissolve quickly, but the 
oil-based lubricants, semi-solid fats, suet, schmaltz, &c. will take
 some time. Expect to find an oily residue scumming the top of the 
bucket used in Step Three:

3. Thrust your hand into the bucket of ice water which 
your wife has brought in from the kitchen.  Leave it in there until the 
ring-bearer screams. When he does, shoot him a look of unconcealed 
embarrassment with a hint of disappointment, then allow him to “tough” 
it out for another three minutes. Once he passes out, remove his hand 
from the bucket and check to see that the desired amount of 
vasoconstriction has occurred, then repeat steps one and two.

You may notice that despite the intense cold and vigorous oily 
massaging, the area above the ring becomes increasingly swollen. This is
 normal. God designed the human body intelligently: when you 
unsuccessfully attempt to remove a ring from a swollen finger, your body
 responds by further swelling the finger. It may also turn begin to turn
 dark as more and more blood rushes to into the injured finger. Now 
would be a good time to consult the Internet.  Find the _Ask MetaFilter_ thread on “[ring removal](http://ask.metafilter.com/22649/Ring-removal+ring+stuck+finger)” and proceed to Step Four:

4. Do what the jewelers do: spray Windex on the finger and twist and pull. Do it again. Then again. The [trick](http://ask.metafilter.com/22649/Ring-removal#362739)
 is to do this repeatedly so as to unlock the magical lubricative power 
of Windex. Then consider the probable reason jewelers use Windex: a 
jewelery shop consists almost entirely of display cases and Windex is 
sort of wet. At this point it will be past midnight. There is nothing 
more you can do. Put away the Windex and have the ring-bearer proceed to
 Step Five.

5. What you need to do now, ring-bearer, is drink enough vodka to 
catch a few hours of restless sleep in which you alternate between 
dreams in which you are [Hans Brinker](http://www.thehollandring.com/hans-brinker-story.shtml),
 son of a sluicer, and Hans Brinker, son of a space station captain.  
Alcohol is a diuretic, which should help with the swelling. Eat some 
pistachio nuts too, since salt absorbs water. There is also the chance 
that your finger may mysteriously unswell during the night.

6. You will awake to discover that your finger has not mysteriously 
unswollen during the night. That it has, in fact, swelled larger and 
darkened ominously. You should consult the Internet to learn that 1) 
fingers are naturally more swollen in the morning, 2) your body responds
 to a) alcohol-induced dehydration and b) the massive amount of sodium 
found in pistachio nuts by swelling. Now panic.

You may want to panic for a good long while. Remember, this is your _right_ ring
 finger, and although you are ambidextrous, relearning how to do 
everything with your left hand will still be unthinkably inconvenient.  
Once you can breathe again, go online and learn what you need to do for 
Step Seven:

7. Elevate the hand above your heart for 15-20 minutes, 
then repeat steps one and two. When that fails to work, place a bucket 
of ice water on a chair, sit on the floor, then elevate it into the 
bucket and repeat steps three, one and two in that order.  Pine for the 
mangy days of yore, then consult the internet again and proceed to Step 
Eight.

Step Eight will require string or dental floss, but have no fear, for it is [endorsed](http://www.health.harvard.edu/fhg/firstaid/ring.shtml) by The Harvard School of Medicine.

Step Eight, Part the First:
“Pass an end of fine string or dental floss under the 
ring. With the other end, begin tightly wrapping the string around the 
finger. Ensure that the string is wrapped evenly and smoothly past the 
lower knuckle.”
Step Eight, Part the Second:
“With the end that was passed under the ring, begin 
unwrapping the string in the same direction. The ring should move over 
the string as the string is unwrapped.”

It should, but it will not. In fact, the act of wrapping the 
fluid-engorged finger will cause pain the likes of which reasonable 
people compare to birth-pangs. This will make your move to Step Eight, 
Part the Third particularly daring.

Step Eight, Part the Third:

Repeat variations of Step Eight, Parts the First and Second with 
packing tape, then Saran Wrap. When you regain consciousness, consider 
picking up the telephone and calling your local jeweler or emergency 
room. Exhausted interns and jewelers both keep one of [these](https://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&hs=dBh&rls=org.mozilla%!A(MISSING)en-US%!A(MISSING)official&q=jeweler+ring+cutter) handy for just such an occasion.

Now pony up the $35 it costs for the jeweler to repair it, and resume
 plucking the hairs from your beard one at a time. If your wife 
complains, remind her of what happened the last time. If she insists on 
reminding you about your [mother’s favorite story](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/how-to-remove-a.html#comment-78713952)—about
 the time you got your head stuck in a toilet seat and the rescue squad 
had to be called in, and since your father drove an ambulance with that 
very squad, all the paramedics knew you and teased you  as they used the
 [jaws of life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic\_rescue\_tools) to extricate your head,[[\*]](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/how-to-remove-a.html#comment-78751680)
 and did your mother mention she has a picture of you bawling, the 
toilet seat around your head, which she took while she waited for the 
paramedics to arrive, because she does and it is around here 
somewhere—if she insists on reminding you of that, turn up the 
television and pretend you can’t hear her, because you can’t win this 
one.
