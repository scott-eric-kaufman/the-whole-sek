Next week Rich and I will host a mini-book-event he's cleverly titled "The Stoning of [Adam Roberts](http://www.adamroberts.com/)."  We'll be responding to Adam's novel [_Stone_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0575073969)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1).  Adam will respond to our responses.  We'll respond to his.  You'll respond to ours.  He'll respond to yours.  It will be supremely eventful.  Be there.  Or don't be.  Then regret it.

_Forever._  

Also: If you would like to add "Guest Poster on Acephalous" to your résumé (who wouldn't?) drop me a line when you've finished reading the novel with a general idea of what you'd like to write about and I'll consider you for the position.  

Of "Guest Poster."
