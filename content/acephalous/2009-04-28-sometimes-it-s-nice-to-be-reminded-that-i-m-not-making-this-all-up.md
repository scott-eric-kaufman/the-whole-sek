## Sometimes it's nice to be reminded that I'm not making this all up.

[Me](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/prelude-to-a-scene-analysis-of-bryan-singers-superman-returns.html):

[_Superman Returns_] mines the imagery of 9/11 in order to address the shit mist of
uncertainty Americans fumbled through from 9/12 forward.  

[Warren Ellis](http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=7252):

I defined _[Global Frequency](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401202748/diesekoschmar-20)_ from the start as Rescue Fiction, if not
explicitly Post-9/11 Rescue Fiction. Because _[Thunderbirds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbirds\_%!T(MISSING)V\_series%!)(MISSING)_ is the
anti-Superman . . . But immediately after 9/11 I found people on message boards
ACTUALLY SAYING OUT LOUD that they wished Superman were real because he
would have saved the WTC. And that is an anti-evolutionary wish. What
you say is, I wish the dozen or so people who knew this was going to
happen could have informed someone who’d actually listen and that we
had had the sense/madness to engineer a mechanical response to someone
attacking NYC with flying death tubes.

_Thunderbirds_: Darwin’s Airforce.

shit mist.  I'm wondering.  shitmist?  shit-mist?  very Kingesque.  As in Stephen.  Author of such phrases as "mouse fart" and frequent use of the past tense of to shit "shat".  Very nice indeed.

I'm not sure where King got it from, but I certainly know who I stole it from (if not exactly where): Hunter S. Thompson.  It's either in _Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail_ or in his collected letters from that period, but I don't have either book handy at the moment.
