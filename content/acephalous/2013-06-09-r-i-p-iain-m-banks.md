Not that it's unexpected, but all signs point to [Iain M. Banks having lost](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22835047) [his battle with cancer this morning](http://io9.com/iain-m-banks-author-of-the-culture-novels-has-passed-512173168). I am, [for the record](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/03/an-annoying-anonymous-person-writes-why-is-it-any-time-anyone-hipsters-or-academics-are-supposed-to-like-dies.html), allowed to mourn his passing without [conservative self-promoters like John Ziegler attacking me](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/how-to-be-an-as.html)
 for falsely lionizing the recently deceased. Should he or any 
like-minded asshole try any such thing, I have no doubt he'll feel the 
full force of the online equivalent of Special Circumstances.

I'll write a Banks a proper send-off once I gather my thoughts, but 
for now, I'll acknowledge we've lost a great one and leave it at that.
