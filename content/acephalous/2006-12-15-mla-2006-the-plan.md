Many of you will be attending the MLA in Philadelphia in a few
weeks, and we here at The Internet would love to meet as many of you as
we can.  “My” [panel on academic blogging](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/another\_mla\_pan.html) is Saturday at 8:30 a.m. in room 308 of the Philadelphia Marriott—a terrible time, yes, but _perfect_ for a brunch afterwards so long as too many people don’t attend.  Thing is, I’ve heard word that too many people _will_
in fact attend, which means we ought to think about alternative
arrangements.  Some of us will be heading to D.C. Saturday night for [UnfoggeDCon](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week\_2006\_11\_26.html#005856).  Others have plans for early Friday evening, but maybe a later engagement could be arranged?  (After all, it _is_ Friday night.)   

Then there’s Thursday night.  Many of you will already be around for
Amardeep, Michael, Rita Felski and Jeffrey Williams’ panel on “[Literary Studies in the Public Sphere](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/mla\_2006/index.html)“ (scroll down), which begins promptly at 12:00 p.m. in the Philadelphia Marriott’s Liberty Ballroom Salon C.  

I’m merely throwing out ideas here.  Anyone who’s interested
(participants included) in attending some sort of blog-specific
extra-curricular activity send me an email at scotterickaufman (at)
gmail (dot) com.  Give us a general idea of your schedule and we’ll try
to accommodate as many people as is mathematically possible.
