I confess:

[This](http://www.google.com/search?q=joan+didion&hl=en&hs=sgU&lr=&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official\_s&start=80&sa=N) overjoys me.

If only she were a [known](http://www.theoria.ca/theoria/2006/01/more\_zizek.html) (or suspected) Vanity Googler.

Is Zizek reputed to google himself?  The problem with yours is that any search/visit to your site wouldn't appear out of the ordinary in the statistics.  Ljubljana sticks out quite a bit.  Especially when the search term is the name of someone known to spend time there.

Alas, you've been demoted to page 10.

No I haven't.  I've been demoted to #12.  One day I'll crack Google's page-rank code.  Then you'll all rue the day you, uh, crossed me?

People who don't Google themselves either are pretending to lack vanity, have no curiosity about things Webby and/or don't know any better. Only rare kinds of crazy people seem not to care what other people think of them. I'd get giddy if I thought "stars" were visiting my post about them, but unlike Groucho I wouldn't count it against them. After all, we don't want to hurt the stars' feelings. Maybe you'd like them more if they didn't care what mere mortals like ourselves think. I'd like them less.

I've had a couple of filmmakers (or their publicists) contact me on the basis of a vanity Google.  So, you never know....
