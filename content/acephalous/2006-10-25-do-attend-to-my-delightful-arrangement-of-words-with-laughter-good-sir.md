Silas Weir Mitchell to Amelia G. Mason (8 November 1910):
I told Horace Furness that I had the joyous intention of writing a paper in defence of my opinion that Queen Elizabeth wrote Shakespeare's plays; as for Bacon, that is over and done for; indeed, the fat so to speak, is in the fire, and it is hopeless to get out.Â  _Please observe the relation between Bacon and fat._

From _Weir Mitchell: His Life and Letters_, ed. Anna Robeson Burr (New York City: Duffield & Company, 1929).

There's something admirable about being this willing to telegraph, nay, rivet-gun, your joke.  It's downright thrifty -- the chance for enjoyment of your attempted witticism might otherwise be wasted.

That's _awesome_.  Was this the first known example of the kind of nodding, meta-aware comedy popularized by SNL's Norm MacDonald et al?

You know, I hadn't made the MacDonald connection, but say it in his voice, and it's suddenly as droll as he thinks it is.

Well, almost.
