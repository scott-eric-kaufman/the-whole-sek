## Most Unnecessary Signpost Ever?

From Chapter 1 of Francis Galton's _Fingerprints_ (1892):
This first and introductory chapter contains a brief and orderly summary of the contents of those that follow.

I should add: I didn't mean [the earlier post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/04/in-what-follows.html) to represent any strong feelings about signposts one way or another.  From the reader's perspective, signposts make it [easier to skim](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/04/in-what-follows.html#comment-109299736); from the conference attendee's, they're all that stands between [understanding and drooling unintelligibility](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/04/in-what-follows.html#comment-109340450).  But they need to be done well and [in moderation](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/04/in-what-follows.html#comment-109615084) or [nothing resembling suspense](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/04/in-what-follows.html#comment-109435728) will obtain to the argument.  I know I'm valuing something inessential in critical and historical prose, but wouldn't finding some way to integrate contemporary methodologies into [studies like this](http://books.google.com/books?id=g-oOAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%!v(MISSING)an+wyck+brooks%!&(MISSING)ei=dWf6R\_DvA5GosgOt7\_iECg&client=firefox-a) be something wonderful?

But suspense is bad! I don't want to wait in suspense to find out what the argument is - I want to know what I'm getting into from the start! (I always tell my students they're not writing a mystery novel and no one will be upset if they give away the ending at the beginning.)

That said - yeah, your example here is a kind of unnecessary one, I'll give you that.

This is such a disciplinary thing, I can see --- it's definitely historians who are pro-signposting here. Me, I  hate to see much signposting in a lit essay --- and the thought of skimming and skipping through someone's lit argument, if it's any good, just sounds wrong.
