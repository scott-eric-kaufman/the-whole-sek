Like everyone approximately my age, I grew up holding cardboard toilet paper tubes and pretending a beam of light extended from one end.  In backyards and bedrooms, children like me would mouth fuzzy whooshing noises at each other in pantomime light-saber play.  Today's youth need not strain their imagination:

Unleashed_ video game for the Wii. Players will be able to control the
Lightsaber with the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk will be used for force
powers.

Maybe you can take over for me as the WAAGNFNP's official _Star Wars_ blogger.  I wonder when onechan will be old enough to play this with me, provided we'll ever be able to afford it.
