From Silas Weir Mitchell's _The Youth of Washinton_ (1907):

He was the only black man I ever saw who could handle bees, for these industrious little insects have a great enmity to negroes.

Mitchell stuffs these words in George Washington's mouth and is lauded as the most patriotic American novelist _ever_ by no less than three national newspapers.Â  The [_Washington Bee_](http://www.culturaltourismdc.org/info-url3948/info-url\_show.htm?doc\_id=206740&attrib\_id=7967) wasn't one of them.

Go figure.
