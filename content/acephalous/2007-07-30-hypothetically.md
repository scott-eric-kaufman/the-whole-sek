The most embarrassing thing one could accidentally post to a professional listserv is a draft of your outraged letter to the President of HBO decrying the portrayal of "[furries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry\_fandom)" on a [recent episode](http://www.cinemablend.com/television/TV-Recap-Entourage-The-Day-Fu-kers-5545.html) of _Entourage_.Â

In theory, I'd suggest that a draft letter to a student inviting them over for "furry fun" might be more embarassing. Perhaps only if it also invoked Entourage.

Dear [Student],

While doing my biannual watching of the television, I discovered on the HBO Channel a show entitled _Entourage_.  My interest was particularly piqued by the character of "Turtle," whose friend "Drama" convinced him to have sexual relations with an attractive woman whilst donning a plush pink bunny suit.  As I have now turned the television off for the next six months, I am somewhat at a loss as to do what to do now.  Perhaps you would like to join me for a tumbler of whiskey and some furry fun?

Cheers,

Dr. [X]

I'm sorry, but 'Furries' means only one thing to me: [the best Welsh rock band in the history of the universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super\_Furry\_Animals).

Owch. Well, at least they know how passionate you are about your interests . . .

If you put it that way, I'm going to go back to the original as the most embarrassing, if less actionable.
