## Dear Person or Persons With Whom I Share Plumbing,

I appreciate you sharing the reek of cheap ganja with anyone who enters my apartment.  Showering to the smell of stale bong water invigorates my soul.  Watching your morning fog on its miasmatic creep from the bathroom into the hall, then from the hall into my office, is the highlight of my day.  You have a kind heart.  

However, I find the material I produce in the wake of your morning ablution decidedly subpar.  This morning I transcribed a passage from Herbert Spencer's _Psychology_ thus: "Every form of Intelligence being, in essence, an adjustmust of inner to outer relations; it results that as, in the advance of this adjustmust, the outer relations increase number, in complexity, in heterogeneity, by degrees that cannot be marked."  Granted, in terms of Lamarckian adaptation, the neologism "adjustmust" has some traction: individuals who "adjustmaybe" are less likely to survive than the "adjustmusters" who [crane their necks for the next highest leaf](http://acephalous.typepad.com/giraffe.gif).

But I digress.  (I do that a lot lately.)  I know what you're thinking: "_Dude_.  Just 'cause you see my smokes in your place don't mean you score a contact high.  _Seriously_."  Perhaps.  You _do_ know about those scientific studies of scent and cognitive function, right?  The ones saying strong scents like peppermint work as mnemonics, and that you remember what you were thinking when you first smelt those smells?  Because let me tell you: 

The crap my brain excavates every time you pump my place full of your noxious weed ain't exactly helping me finish my dissertation.  Quite the opposite.  It would be _awesome_ if you could do your business in some room not connected to any of mine.  If you must—if it's bathroom or bust—maybe not toke so early in the morning or keep it up for quite so long.  You have work to do, and I'm sure the [shirts](http://www.google.com/search?q=hemp+shirts) you smoke don't help so much.  

Make an adjustmust.

All will be cool.

Verily, from today, this shall be my mantra:  _I must I must adjust my must_.  Words to live by.

I suspect nobody has commented because nobody wants to admit to any experience with these matters -- pot or plumbing, either one. 

I would suggest either capping the drains -- cheap rubber covers should do it -- or making use of the bathroom fan (if your building is new enough to have those). Also calling the police is an option, but that might seem too drastic for some. Those of us who actually support legalization in the abstract need to deal with the secondhand smoke issue, I see.

Between that headless statue and your neighbors, your apartment building seems to have some character - or at least serve as home to a few characters!  Long live characters. - TL

And [the use of analogies in mayoral campaigns](http://mlyhlss.blogspot.com/2007/07/berube-mayoral-campaign-kicks-off-with.html)....  That's what we were talking about, right?
