(_[I kid you not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus).  For reasons unrelated to my turning in the Twain chapter and polishing my introduction, my right foot has swollen like you wouldn't believe.  I barely believe it and it's mine.  As I have no clue what to do besides [RICE](http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/rest-ice-compression-and-elevation-rice-topic-overview) it, I thought I'd repost my other swelling-related adventure_—_don't [you dare even think it](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my\_morning.html)_—_in the hopes my foot will resume its regularly-scheduled size shortly._)

There you are on a Saturday night, futzing with your wedding ring because your wife thinks your [trichotillomania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotillomania)
makes you look mangy: off your left ring finger, onto your right
pinkie; off your right pinkie, onto your left pinkie; off your left
pinkie, onto your right ring finger; off your right ring finger, off
your right ring finger, _OFF YOUR RIGHT RING FINGER_, _non et cetera_.  You pull and you twist; you pull while twisting and you twist while pulling all to no avail.  

You look at your wife and you tell her, "I've misplaced my wedding band."  She will look at you, _j'accuse_ burning
in her eyes, until you hold up your right hand.  She will then enter
the kitchen and return with the ingredients required to perform Step
One:
1. Apply cold water and a little soap.  Gently
work the soap under the ring and twist.  If the ring still does not
come off, massage the area of the finger below the knuckle to remove
some of the fluid from the finger.  Wait a few minutes, then repeat. 
Continue until the finger is good and chafed. 

After
fifteen minutes of repeated failure, your wife will walk back into the
kitchen and return with the materials needed for Step Two:
2.
Dry the chafed finger with hand towel, then apply the following in any
order: water-based lubricants, oil-based lubricants, semi-solid fats,
hydrogenated vegetable oils, as well as any lard, suet, ghee, tallow,
or schmaltz you find lying around.  As with the soap and water, work
the slippery substance under the ring and twist and turn.  Carefully
slip a knife under the ring and try to slide it over the knuckle.  If
the ring-bearer cries in pain, ascertain whether its source is the ring
jamming on the knuckle or the knife slicing into it. 

This
too will fail.  Your wife will walk back into the kitchen yet again. 
Take this opportunity to try to wash your hilariously lubed finger. 
The water-based lubricants will dissolve quickly, but the oil-based
lubricants, semi-solid fats, suet, schmaltz, &c. will take some
time.  Expect to find an oily residue scumming the top of the bucket
used in Step Three:  

3. Thrust your hand into the
bucket of ice water which your wife has brought in from the kitchen. 
Leave it in there until the ring-bearer screams.  When he does, shoot
him a look of unconcealed embarrassment with a hint of disappointment,
then allow him to "tough" it out for another three minutes.  Once he
passes out, remove his hand from the bucket and check to see that the
desired amount of vasoconstriction has occurred, then repeat steps one
and two. 

You may notice that despite the intense
cold and vigorous oily massaging, the area above the ring becomes
increasingly swollen.  This is normal.  God designed the human body
intelligently: when you unsuccessfully attempt to remove a ring from a
swollen finger, your body responds by further swelling the finger.  It
may also turn begin to turn dark as more and more blood rushes to into
the injured finger.  Now would be a good time to consult the internet. 
Find the _Ask MetaFilter_ thread on "[ring removal](http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:8YUO5811bmMJ:ask.metafilter.com/22649/Ring-removal+ring+stuck+finger)" and proceed to Step Four:

			

				4. Do what the jewelers do: spray Windex on the finger and twist and pull.  Do it again.  Then again.  The [trick](http://ask.metafilter.com/22649/Ring-removal#362739)
is to do this repeatedly so as to unlock the magical lubricative power
of Windex.  Then consider the probable reason jewelers use Windex: a
jewelery shop consists almost entirely of display cases and Windex is
sort of wet.  At this point it will be past midnight.  There is nothing
more you can do.  Put away the Windex and have the ring-bearer proceed
to Step Five.

5. What you need to do now, ring-bearer, is drink enough vodka to
catch a few hours of restless sleep in which you alternate between
dreams in which you are [Hans Brinker](http://www.thehollandring.com/hans-brinker-story.shtml),
son of a sluicer, and Hans Brinker, son of a space station captain. 
Alcohol is a diuretic, which should help with the swelling.  Eat some
pistachio nuts too, since salt absorbs water.  There is also the chance
that your finger may mysteriously unswell during the night.

6. You will awake to discover that your finger has not mysteriously
unswollen during the night.  That it has, in fact, swelled
larger and darkened ominously.  You should consult the internet to
learn that 1) fingers are naturally more swollen in the morning, 2)
your body responds to a) alcohol-induced dehydration and b) the massive
amount of sodium found in pistachio nuts by swelling.  Now panic. 

You may want to panic for a good long while.  Remember, this is your _right_ ring
finger, and although you are ambidextrous, relearning how to do
everything with your left hand will still be unthinkably inconvenient. 
Once you can breathe again, go online and learn what you need to do for
Step Seven:
7. Elevate the hand above your heart for
15-20 minutes, then repeat steps one and two.  When that fails to work,
place a bucket of ice water on a chair, sit on the floor, then elevate
it into the bucket and repeat steps three, one and two in that order. 
Pine for the mangy days of yore, then consult the internet again and
proceed to Step Eight.

Step Eight will require string or dental floss, but have no fear, for it is [endorsed](http://www.health.harvard.edu/fhg/firstaid/ring.shtml) by The Harvard School of Medicine.  
Step Eight, Part the First:"Pass an end of fine string or dental floss under the ring. With the
other end, begin tightly wrapping the string around the finger. Ensure
that the string is wrapped evenly and smoothly past the lower knuckle."Step Eight, Part the Second:"With the end that was passed under the ring, begin unwrapping the
string in the same direction. The ring should move over the string as
the string is unwrapped."

It should, but it will not.  In fact, the act of wrapping the
fluid-engorged finger will cause pain the likes of which reasonable
people compare to birth-pangs.  This will make your move to Step Eight,
Part the Third particularly daring.

Step Eight, Part the Third:

Repeat variations of Step Eight, Parts the First and Second with
packing tape, then Saran Wrap.  When you regain consciousness, consider
picking up the telephone and calling your local jeweler or emergency
room.  Exhausted interns and jewelers both keep one of [these](http://www.hallmarksurgico.com/emt/0829.gif) handy for just such an occasion. 

Now
pony up the $35 it costs for the jeweler to repair it, and resume
plucking the hairs from your beard one at a time.  If your wife
complains, remind her of what happened the last time.  If she insists
on reminding you about your [mother's favorite story](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/how-to-remove-a.html#comment-78713952)—about the time you
got your head stuck in a toilet seat and the rescue squad had to be
called in, and since your father drove an ambulance with that very
squad, all the paramedics knew you and teased you  as they used the [jaws of life](http://www.aransascountyems.com/JAWS1a.jpg)
to extricate your head,[[\*]](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/how-to-remove-a.html#comment-78751680) and did your mother mention she has a picture
of you bawling, the toilet seat around your head, which she took while
she waited for the paramedics to arrive, because she does and it is
around here somewhere—if she insists on reminding you of that, turn up
the television and pretend you can't hear her, because you can't win
this one.

Maybe you've got [poor man's gout](http://books.google.com/books?id=zGxKYkwbudYC&pg=PA547&lpg=PA547&dq=poorman+gout&source=web&ots=f\_6SPh2ozU&sig=VIbU8t7f97iG\_ASEw4C\_VyGH\_iE&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book\_result&resnum=7&ct=result).

Such thrashing about.  What an agonizing post.  I do hope that no further injury resulted.

Sometimes lack of exercise will result in freak injuries of the legs and feet.  Best to keep in motion and endure the pain if possible.

Regarding the wedding ring saga---have it enlarged a size or two!!!

After having read this most entertaining post......and as a nod to the new academic year.......I give you an historian for our times:
