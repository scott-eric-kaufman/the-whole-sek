## The Plot of Obama's Tangled Web of Lies Thickens: It Wasn't Even a Concentration Camp

The latest in long line of gaffes conservatives are manufacturing on Obama's behalf concerns the service record of his uncle, Charles Payne, during WWII.  Obama claims Payne [helped liberate a concentration camp](http://sweetness-light.com/archive/a-query-to-the-89th-divisions-website).  Only a gullible liberal would believe that.  His uncle did nothing of the sort!  He helped liberate [a _work_ camp](http://sweetness-light.com/archive/a-query-to-the-89th-divisions-website#comment-111534), Ohrdurf, not a _concentration_ camp like Auschwitz.  Obama is a liar, courting [the Jewish vote](http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous\_conservative/2008/05/a-new-problem-f.html) by inflating the importance of Ohrdurf.  When Patton toured Ohrdurf, he didn't "[walk over to a corner and sicken](http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0375754210/ref=sib\_dp\_srch\_pop?v=search-inside&keywords=ohrdurf&go.x=0&go.y=0&go=Go%!#(MISSING))."  

_He did_?  Who told you that?  _Him_?  [Mr. Secret Muslim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar\_Bradley)?  You'll need to do better than that.  

_You can_?  I don't believe you.  It's not like you have [archival footage](http://www.buyoutfootage.com/pages/titles/pd\_dc\_021.html) of Gen. Dwight David Eisenhower, Commander, Supreme Headquarters Allied
Expeditionary Forces, Generals Omar M. Bradley, George S. Patton and
others viewing the crematorium and the bodies stacked in court yard and woodshed.  

_You do_?  I see.  I also see it's _conveniently_ priced at $649.  I'll believe it when I see it, but as everyone knows liberals are only generous with other people's money, I doubt that'll ever happen.  You don't even have a graphic, disturbing picture from the camp that should only be viewed by people with strong stomachs and even then only if they're empty.

[_You do_](http://www.trumanlibrary.org/photographs/displayimage.php?pointer=3907)?  So what.  Ohrdurf was a _work_ camp, not a _concentration_ camp.  Anyone who ignores this _very_ important, _incredibly_ meaningful, _absolutely_ crucial distinction is simply trying to score political points with the Jewish community.

Some conservative bloggers "chased this story", and here's the response they got, [quoted in full](http://www.sadlyno.com/archives/9609.html):

"Please crawl back under the rock you came out from.

Good day

Raymond Kitchell, veteran 89th Inf Div"

Of course conservabots have no shame, so they won't even realize what a slam they just took from the greatest generation.  But it's a truly awesome slam.

They were _all_ "concentration camps"\* as were the places where Japanese and Japanese Americans were held in the US. It's a perfectly legitimate term for both forced labor centers (like Ohrdurf), detention sites (like Tule Lake) and mass execution facilities (like Auschwitz). 

\* I hate using the term "camp" in this context, as it implies both natural fun and impermanence, neither of which are appropriate.

NO THEY WEREN'T AHISTORIWHATEVECALLOUNSNESS!?!  YOUR WRONG! WORK CAMPS DON'T CONCENTRATE!  YOU DON'T KNOW FROM HISTORY YOU SAY SO YOURSELF WITH YOUR NAME!

A-a-a-a-a-hem.  Sorry about that.  Don't know what got into me.

Wait, yes I do.  It was Nazi.  Nazi got into me and I thought there was an important distinction between "work" and "death" camps to be made.  

Won't happen again.

(Least not until I'm evil.)

(Again.)

(And yes, Rich, that is indeed all kinds of awesome.  It's almost like people who fight in wars don't like people who don't fight but encourage others to die in them are bitter or something.)

Damn, you're good. 

The narrowing of the term "concentration camp" to "death factory" bugs me, because it makes it hard to talk about anything. It's a free-range peeve.

You sir are a god.  Just out of curiosity, are you using the adequacy.org patented auto-linking engine?

I am sure the entire Jewish community appreciates your fine points and distinctions between the concentration camps and the work camps.  I take it the lucky jews got sent to the work camps to die while the unlucky jews got sent to the concentration camps to die.  Thanks for clarifying it.

The best thing is that one of the wingnut wankers who emailed Kitchell is a furry with a thing for skunks.
