The title of tonight's episode of AMC's _The Walking Dead_ 
couldn't have been more misleading: "Isolation" is an episode about the 
utter lack of isolation in the confined settings of a 
prison-cum-anti-zombie outpost. Even those moments in the episode in 
which characters were ostensibly isolated -- as when Herschel tells Carl
 that "It's peaceful out here" when they're "alone" in the woods 
collecting elderberries -- were undermined by:

Or, even more obviously, when Daryl, Michonne, Tyrese and that-other-guy-from-_The Wire_
 were driving along an empty road and heard voices on the radio, 
indicating that they weren't isolated, and then ran into this lot:

Those are the more prevalent examples of the episode's visuals 
defying its title, because they're both keyed in on plot points: 
Herschel appreciates being alone when he isn't, and Daryl _et al_
 accidentally run into one of the most populous zombie hordes on the 
show to date after hearing a faint voice on the radio. But I'm more 
interested in how the visuals themselves undermined the idea that this 
episode was, thematically, about "isolation," and you can see hints of 
it in that first image of Carl and Herschel above.

If you look at it, there are three planes within the frame: in the 
foreground, you have Herschel; in the mid-ground, you have Carl; and in 
the background, you have the walker. All of the planes are occupied in a
 way that, conventionally, makes a frame feel "crowded." If a director 
-- in this case, [Daniel Sackheim](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0755261/?ref\_=tt\_ov\_dr)
 -- uses a shot in which three people occupy all three planes in an 
episode once, you might not notice it. But in this episode, Sackheim 
consistently stacks the frame, almost from the opening shot of the 
episode...
