			**Jen:** CALIFORNIA'S BURNING!

**Pat:** That's really interesting, Jen, because you know what else is burning?  Felicia Smith of Santa Ana's love for the kind of quality programming you can only find here on NPR.  She says it's a constant companion, whether she's on the way to work, running errands, or having unimpassioned sex with her fiancé of eleven years.  

**Bob:** Speaking of impending nuptials, Pat, people really value their relationship to NPR.  Kat Little from Costa Mesa even compares the difference between being a listener and an active supporter to the hours between when a couple exchanges their vows and the moment the marriage is consummated.  "You've already made the commitment," she says, "but only 100 percent of the way.  You need to go 110 percent and hit that already."

**Pat:** Funny you should mention math, Bob, because here at NPR listeners will find exclusive maths they can't find anywhere else.  Consider when you're on the highway with your secretary, on the way to your favorite bed and breakfast, and you think about the first time you hit that and you wonder whether your infidelity is a personal failing or the product of millions of years of evolution, so you turn on NPR because where else can you get [the Loh Down on Science](http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast\_detail.php?siteId=7060613)? and you learn not even swans or fruit flies mate for life and start thinking about the sweet inevitable love you're about to make with your secretary.

**Bob:** And maybe when you're done you can buy her the gift of an NPR supporter package where she'll receive not one but _two_ copies of the book _Green Living through Healthy Oil and Taxes_.  It makes a great stocking stuffer for anyone who already listens to NPR as much as you do and received their copy when their membership was automatically renewed for the seventeenth year running.  Being a contributor is just simply that convenient.

**Pat:** While we're on the subject of convenience, Bob, if our listener and his secretary's favorite bed and breakfast is anywhere north of Orange County, they'll likely find their route up there to be really tortured by the lines of fires currently engulfing all of Los Angeles County and much of the rest of the Southland.  For more on this important story, the kind of story and reporting you can only find on NPR, we turn to Jen on the scene.

**Jen:** CALIFORNIA'S BURNING!  CHRIST YOU FUCKER EVERYTHING'S ON FUCKING FIRE!

**Bob:** That's really interesting, Jen, because you know what else is on fire?  Copies of _Green Living through Healthy Oil and Taxes_ which the _LA Times_ calls the must-read book this holiday season . . .

Ha ha!  I noticed that just the other day.  "This is a grim reminder of the vital service KPCC provides," is how the guy tried to sell it.
