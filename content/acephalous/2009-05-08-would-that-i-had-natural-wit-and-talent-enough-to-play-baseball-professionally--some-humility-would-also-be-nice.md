## Would that I had natural wit <em>and</em> talent enough to play baseball professionally.  (Some humility would also be nice.)

Fans of good writing (which, if you're reading this, you clearly are), I would like to introduce you to [Chris "Disco" Hayes](http://discohayes.mlblogs.com/).  He may be rough around the edges, but he has a sense of prose (so rare in an age when so few read) and can turn a phrase.  Not surprisingly, he has [an analytic turn of mind](http://discohayes.mlblogs.com/archives/2009/04/oops\_my\_babip.html).  But this post is about the writing, so here he is on PFPs ("pitcher's fielding practice"), which

consist of a line of pitchers waiting to walk up onto the mound to fake
their pitching motion and run over to a ball that has been rolled down
the third base line by a pitching coach, pick it up, and throw the ball
to a lucky veteran pitcher who is stationed at first base.  After
completing your turn, you go back to the end of the line and repeat. 
Once you have been through enough times that you are convinced playing
in games is merely a drill to prepare you for PFPs[.]

Prior to the start of spring training, I'd advise you begin joining
every minor league player in cheering hardest during the World Series
not for a team, but for solid PFP work.  You see, the first week of
spring training for pitchers is a series of lectures from pitching
coaches about how important PFPs can be.  Imagine the momentum and the
voracity with which these lectures were given in the Spring of 2007
after the [Tigers' PFP performance in the 2006 World Series](http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061028&content\_id=1726047&vkey=perspectives&fext=.jsp&c\_id=mlb). 
I had cold sweats and my feet started to ache in mere anticipation of
the upcoming spring training during game 5 in 2006 as Verlander
Bucknered the 5th of his team's 5 PFPs into right field for the 7th and
8th unearned runs en route to losing the series.   

On [being humbled by a physical and humiliated by a physician](http://discohayes.mlblogs.com/archives/2009/02/its\_all\_greek\_to\_me.html):

My calves are really the one and only
attribute of my body people might look at in a body catalog and want
to order for themselves. My ankles are skinny and athletic-looking
and my calves are well defined. [F]rom the
knee down I'm pretty proud of my body.  

[The team physician] taps the back of my ankle near the
Achilles and says, "Make sure you stretch this out well, it's a bit
tight." I take it to heart (though it nearly breaks mine) and nod
my head. Duly noted.   

And then the joke hits me. It's witty,
it's relevant ... ah, it's perfect. It happens so fast, before I
know it my lips are making a coy, dry grin to indicate I'm about to
be a smart alec.  I figure the Doctor has a hundred physicals to
perform, I might as well make a part of his day funny. Accordingly,
I ask, "Would you say it's my Achilles Heel?" I swear I'm not
making this up. It was so perfect. Contextually ... My entire body
functions perfectly, but there's one specific area that may be a flaw
that could lead to an injury? _And_ it's my Achilles? Gold. 
Well played, Mr. Hayes. Delivery was good. Timing: better.

Everything came together like a sinker
just a wink below the knees that gets wrapped to the shortstop for a
double play. The batter practically slipped coming out of the box.

I'm obnoxiously proud of my wit at this
point. I feel like I've teed the "uncontrollable belly-laughter"
golf ball up and handed the Doctor the biggest of Big Berthas. In a
way, now, I'm glad the calves and ankles I love so much have been
hated on simply for the sake of this joke. It's well worth it. 
Unless, someho—

"No, not the heel, just the tendon." 

The Doctor pats me on the shoulder and looks at the next pitcher in
line. Not even a smile. He said it assuringly, like I really
thought it was my tight heel, but everything was going to be OK. He
raises his eyebrows indicating the end of my physical. And it is. I
walk cautiously (so as to not rupture anything) to the calf-stretcher
and sink my head, dropping my gaze to my suspect heel. I can't help
but notice my splendid calves.

On [going undrafted](http://discohayes.mlblogs.com/archives/2009/04/step\_1\_get\_signed.html):

You'd think with 1500 selections, getting
drafted is a pretty easy way to get signed.  And it should be.  In
fact, on the second day of the draft while you listen to name after
name get called, a number of teams will stop drafting players after
round 45.  At this point, you realize you are not getting passed over
for another player, but rather getting passed over for no one.   Your
absence is worth more than your presence to 30 organizations.  

Nothing really to add other than as somehow who teaches writing professionally, I'd kill to get my hands on this kid.  By the way, I think I accidentally found out I won some sort of teaching award.  It was an email in which everyone referred to me in the third person, which leads me to believe I wasn't supposed to be a recepient.
