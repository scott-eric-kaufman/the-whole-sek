Eric's updated [yesterday's post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/voter-registrat.html) in [a format easier on the eyes](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/09/05/change-in-voter-registration/).  Remember that much work remains to be done on it.  Check the original for states whose information I wasn't able to lay my hands on.

'Error 404' certainly is easier on the eyes.  A bit lossy, though, in terms of data ...

Eric pushed the post to the top, which is why it stopped working.  Should work now, though.
