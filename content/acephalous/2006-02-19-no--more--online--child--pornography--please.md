[Observe](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj101a/2006/01/articles\_to\_ana.html) the list of articles my students could have written about.  It didn't occur to me that one-third of them would choose Kurt Eichenwald's "[Through His Webcam, a Boy Joins a Sordid World Online](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj101a/files/throughhiswebcam.doc)."  Maybe I should have foreseen it.

I didn't.

Now I've spend all weekend reading about "camwhores" and the ethical issues involved in writing about them.  Before assigning this article I should've considered whether I wanted to spend two or three days thinking about thirteen year old Justin Berry's descent into a world of online pedophilia and molestation and Mexicon hookers.  Because if I had I may have balked at assigned this particular article.

Instead I find myself writing sentences like "As you note, Eichenwald regularly suggests that Berry wasn't responsible for his decisions, that from the moment he turned on his webcam he was doom to masturbate in front of it for pedophiles."  Not that the topic is unimportant or that, as has been recently suggested, I'm a [prude](http://www.long-sunday.net/long\_sunday/2006/02/interpretation.html).  I work on evolutionary theory.  I think about sexual reproduction _all the time_.  I've T.A.'d for [courses](http://www.ags.uci.edu/~skaufman/teaching/saved%!a(MISSING)s%!h(MISSING)tml/modern%!y(MISSING)outh%!f(MISSING)all%20syllabus.htm) which examined questions of normative sexuality.  I'm not the least bit uncomfortable with the material.

But . . . ugh.

Perhaps the ugh is the ugh of a person who is, in spite of intellection fashion/fascism in the academy, uncomfortable with the fact that the general discussion on pornography, prostitution, and the sex industry by the 'sex-positive' intelligentsia has become a discussion that exploits stories like these to muddy the waters with questions of 'consent' and 'prudery.' 

Speaking of ugh, I feel a rant coming on.

The vast majority of casualties of the industry have no privilege, no illusion of choice at all, but their lives don't make useful stories through which we can display our broad-mindedness, so we ignore them. 

When we come across stories like this one, we don't examine how and why this child Justin was successfully manipulated by both pedophiles and the FBI (and it sounds like an Evangelical/re-baptism church, too), or talk about his privilege and comparative safety in relation to others chewed up and spit out by the industry. 

Instead, we talk about whether or not the reviewer, or teacher, or reader is a 'prude' if they don't tacitly approve of the 'freedom of expression' we falsely use to describe the culture's influence on our interpretations of sex, pornography, consent, rape, exploitation, internalized crap about all of the above.

Pro-sex, anti-industry, and profoundly annoyed by the fact that only upper-middle-class white kids think working in (a privileged little corner of) the sex industry (that is still a part of the whole whether they like it or not) is 'empowered' sexuality -

I sign myself,

Ugh.

Hey there!  First of all, I don't blame you for being all "ugh" about it.  Perfectly acceptable feeling.

Just stumbled onto you in this blogosphere of ours.  Wanted to let you know I really like your writing.

Well, ugh is the least of it as far as I can see.  But I don't agree with Theriomorph that the 'freedom of speech' ethical framework doesn't apply.  How else do we judge the matter?

The big ethical debate this side of the pond a-ce-moment is very much 'freedom of speech': in the light of (a) those cartoons, that have riled up so many muslims; and (b) the news that Holocaust denier David Irving has been jailed for 3 years in Austria for saying that the holocaust never happened.

The Irving case has struck me; since, in ordinary circumstances I wouldn't (as they say) cross the road to piss on him if he were on fire.  Yet I'm now wondering if this isn't one of those fabled 'disagree with what you say, defend to the death your right to say it' circumstances.  At the very least, locking a bloke up for three years for _saying something_ seems wrong to me.  The media buzz in the UK this very evening is that freedom of speech is sacrosanct in law when Muslim's sensibilities are concerned, but suddenly the freedom doesn't apply any more when Jewish sensibilities are the ones being affronted.  I don't think that's right; but I can imagine how it looks from a Muslim p.o.v.

I think freedom of speech is the right mode for talking about this, in part precisely because they put questions of eg prudishness beside the point.  One cardinal law that surely applies to the sex industries is George Bernard Shaw's 'do _not_ do unto others as you would have them do unto you: their tastes may not be the same'.  You might find working in the sex industry demeaning and depressing; I certainly would;  but that doesn't mean other people would feel the same way.

On the other hand, a proper enforcement of laws on 'hate speech' ought to apply to porn too: porn that dramatises the hateful degradation, physical abuse and rape of women (children, men) should be prosecuted as a hate crime.  No?

bluegirl, happy to have you here.  I'm always happy to hear that someone thinks my work worth the price of admission.  

Theriomorph: _Instead, we talk about whether or not the reviewer, or teacher, or reader is a 'prude' if they don't tacitly approve of the 'freedom of expression' we falsely use to describe the culture's influence on our interpretations of sex, pornography, consent, rape, exploitation, internalized crap about all of the above._

They were actually calling me a prude for a supposed reluctance to discuss fisting.  Granted, I don't consider it small-talk material, nor is it in my top ten conversation starters at faculty parties, but I'm not _reluctant_.  That said, what increasingly bothers me about the article, in addition to the points mentioned above, is that it lets Berry off the hook for _everything_.  This kid was a _producer_ and _distributor_ of child pornography; but to hear Eichenwald tell it, he was a victim the minute he plugged in his webcam.  I don't buy it.  Subsequently he _did_ have relationships in which he was obviously the victim of abuse, but he turned that abuse into an empire.  In other words, his situation was the very definition of moral complexity, but Eichenwald chose to flatten it into the stuff of advocacy journalism.   While I understand the impulse, it forced him to write an article whose claims buckle under the weight of its facts; in the long term, that may cause more problems than it solves.  

It's not the _Times_' job to function as an arm of government prosecutors (which was the _Times_' argument in the Judith Miller case).  When reporters write about child molestation in the future, Eichenwald's put them in a bind that didn't previously exist.  He's set a standard — perhaps even a legal standard — for how journalists are to behave when they cover stories about illegal activities.  Another journalist writing about child pornography in the future could be forced, much as Fitzgerald tried to force Judith Miller, to reveal his or her sources in the face of prosecutorial pressure.  His good intentions aside, Eichenwald may have created a precedent that will discourage reporters from investigating child pornography in the future.  

Adam, I find myself nodding my head along--I too would piss on David Irving now and think Shaw hit the nail on the head--but I don't follow the leap from hate speech to pornography, which seems a different medium.  I understand the effect of the cartoons, but don't know whether editorial cartoons (and the representations contained therein) are typically considered protected speech.  (And since Belle's off taking the bar exam for the next three days, I won't have a chance to learn about it in America...but [John Flood](http://johnflood.blogspot.com/) is an English lawyer, er, barrister?  Maybe he'll enlighten us about your side of the pond.)

"I don't follow the leap from hate speech to pornography, which seems a different medium."

Nevertheless, the United States Supreme Court has made just that leap in its discussions of the subject of hate speech.  In Black v. Virginia, the "cross-burning case" from 2003, the Court explicitly compared the two, writing 

Thus, just as a State may regulate only that obscenity which is the most obscene due to its prurient content, so too may a State choose to prohibit only those forms of intimidation that are most likely to inspire fear of bodily harm. 

Black v. Virginia, 538 U.S. 343, 363 (2003).

According to the Court, then, states may regulate particularly egregious forms of hate speech like cross burning for the same reason that they can regulate obscenity--a high level of offensiveness demands that the government (state, federal--you pick 'em) regulate speech/expression that crosses a line of offensiveness.

Just as the government cannot, to the chagrin of Bible-thumpers everywhere, regulate Cinemax's late-night offerings because they are not sufficiently, to borrow a term the Court used in another case, "hard core," hate speech cannot be regulated unless it crosses a line, i.e., it makes a recipient think that harm is sure to follow the expression.  Thus, in the Court's view, burning a cross in the yard of African-Americans is actionable hate speech, while "burning a cross at a political rally" to demonstrate some ideological point (and a sophisticated point it must be, too) is protected speech that governments may not regulate lest they offend the First Amendment.

Leaving the Court and the actual law of the land behind, I think you'd also see hate speech and obscenity coming under attack by detractors for reasons that are essentially the same, namely that they somehow harm recipients independently of any intimidation or offense that arises from them.  I don’t have any examples at my fingertips other than some quotes from a law review article about video games in which the author took a similar tack, arguing that “video games cause children to disregard their natural aversion to killing while at the very least they train children in the art of killing” (I too shiver at how poorly that's written).  I am sure, however, that modest research would turn up similar articles discussing the harm from obscenity and hate speech.

Not wanting to encourage the thread to drift off-topic, but editorial cartoons are a quite core category of protected speech in the US - a status which doesn't mean that anything goes, but which is certainly broad enough to encompass the Jyllands-Posten cartoons.  Other sorts of social and cultural pressures (including commercial pressures), of course, exert a great deal of influence on what gets published in, practice - it's these sorts of pressures (as well as, in some cases, plain and simple fear) that have resulted in the limited reproduction of the cartoons in the US media - not legal constraints.

Other countries understand free speech rights in other ways, and include, for example, racial or religious villification provisions that could limits forms of speech that would be protected in the US.  In Victoria, Australia, where I live now, the state government has recently passed a rather ill-thought-out religious vilification law - and has been progressively realising that the law is not quite... er... working out as expected.  The first case brought under the law (at least, the first case to receive substantial media scrutiny - I'm a legal junkie, but don't work in the trade, so I can easily miss things...) was brought against an evangelical Christian organisation for saying negative things about Islam during a Christian religious revival...  A second case was brought by a prisoner trying to get the Salvation army kicked out of his prison - he claimed that he was a Wiccan and, since the Bible says "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live", Christian religious practices (which he did not have to attend) incited violence against him...  I can speak about either of these cases in more detail, but don't want to divert the thread into my private fascination with free speech law... 

This detour aside, though, I don't think the Jyllands-Posten cartoons were legally problematic in most European countries.  Irving was caught in a specific law on Holocaust denial which, like several earlier respondents, I think is probably not the best way to manage this problem.

"editorial cartoons are a quite core category of protected speech in the US - a status which doesn't mean that anything goes"

With editorial cartoons, I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a situation in which the government could constitutionally proscribe them.  An editorial cartoon could cross the line into obscenity depending on its content, or it could possibly be libelous (which is a difficult case to make if the subject is a public figure, which would be likely in an editorial cartoon).  Incitement to violence or intimidation of a victim, however, would be difficult to demonstrate given the nature of editorial cartoon publication--after all, editorial cartoons are not burned in someone's lawn, they are not typically presented to a mass of people who might riot, and they do not fit the definition of "fighting words."

Theriomorph gets a little too much milage from attacking those sophistcates who support the industry, when it is the laws against a human activity that are the problem.   

Compare the Dutch experience with prostitution and drugs to more hard line societies.

Gary M. - Yes: the voicing in my post may have not communicated my intentions clearly - I was trying to indicate, as you have said quite clearly, that it would normally be very difficult to argue that an editorial cartoon wasn't protected speech.

Oh, that post was funny.  It's brining back all sorts of awful memories of grading rhetoric papers.  The favorite topic of many was the ever popular body image article.  Oh, too, too many freshman papers on women, the popular culture, and body image.  Thank God I didn't have to read 25 papers on "camwhores."
