## BREAKING NEWS: John Cheever not remotely like a character in a John Cheever story, actually.

From “[How Cheever Really Felt About Living in Suburbia](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/nyregion/connecticut/03cheeverCT.html?pagewanted=1&\_r=1),” published in today’s _Times_:

[His] writings suggest that he seemed to take a jaundiced view of so manicured and lovely a setting.

But there is evidence in a new biography of Cheever that he relished
his life as a suburban burgher and did not disdain his fellow
suburbanites as a class. Cheever was “crazy about the suburbs,” said
Blake Bailey, whose book, _Cheever: A Life_, published in March by Knopf, was written with apparently unrivaled access to Cheever’s journals.

“He loved the natural beauty of the Hudson Valley,” Mr. Bailey said.
“He loved walking through the woods along the Croton Aqueduct. He liked
his neighbors.”

I’m not sure how someone can have “unrivaled” access to materials held by [Harvard](http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/%!E(MISSING)hou00054) and [The New York Public Library](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/resources\_for\_american\_literary\_study/v027/27.1bosha.html), but that’s neither here nor there.  This article—from the hard-hitting _Connecticut_
desk—is a full-scale assault on the body of Cheever’s work by people
who insist that, in truth, they were all quite normal, thank you very
much.  Cheever himself was a conventionally quaint exurban alcoholic:

Mrs. Cheever casually took care to point out that her
husband wrote only in the mornings because by the afternoon he was
often drunk on gin.

“In those days, people did drink ever so much more than they do
now,” Mrs. Cheever said with a chuckle. “It sounds shocking now, but it
was not shocking then.”

Not to mention boyish and civic-minded:

“He once got to drive the fire truck, and that was a big thrill,” Mrs. Cheever said.

His family were old-fashioned:

“We were old-fashioned,” she said. “We were brought up in private schools.”

He was old-fashioned:

“He was that old-fashioned,” she said.

He was utterly unlike a character in a John Cheever novel, except when he wasn’t:

Yet at the same time, Cheever could say in ["The
Housebreaker of Shady Hill"], “If you work in the city and have
children to raise, I can’t think of a better place.”

Note that “say” there.  Cheever didn’t _write_ that
sentence, because if he had, it’d be a sentence written about a
character in a Cheever story and we can’t have that, now can we?  It
would be inaccurate in the way all the unhappiness Cheever wrote is and
will forever be inaccurate.  

How deeply pathetic is it that the _Times_ tries to deny Cheever ownership of his insight by doing to him what he undid to his characters?  It was all very fine, the _Times_ implies, like in that famous story of his that ends:

The place was dark. Was it so late that they had all
gone to bed? Had Lucinda stayed at the Westerhazys’ for supper? Had the
girls joined her there or gone someplace else? Hadn’t they agreed, as
they usually did on Sunday, to regret all their invitations and stay at
home? He tried the garage doors to see what cars were in but the doors
were locked and rust came off the handles onto his hands. Going toward
the house, he saw that the force of the thunderstorm had knocked one of
the rain gutters loose. It hung down over the front door like an
umbrella rib, but it could be fixed in the morning. The house was
locked, and he thought that the stupid cook or the stupid maid must
have locked the place up until he remembered that it had been some time
since they had employed a maid or a cook. He shouted, pounded on the
door, tried to force it with his shoulder, and then, looking in at the
windows, saw that the place was empty.

Then everyone yelled, “Surprise, Neddy Merrill!  It is your birthday
and the place looked empty because we cleared the room so we could
dance!” Neddy’s daughters approached him, one after another, and
planted a kiss on his cheek and a tie to his chest.  “I love these
ties,” Neddy exclaimed.  Everyone at the party drank judiciously and no
one died on the way home.  It was the best day of Neddy’s life ever.
