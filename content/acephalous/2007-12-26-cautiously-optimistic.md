## "Cautiously Optimistic"

Before I begin, I want to thank everyone for [the well-wishing](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/mla-for-thee-bu.html#comments).  I would've responded, but I haven't had ready access to a computer since my laptop died a sudden and inexplicable death earlier this week—Sunday?  Monday?  Can't be sure.  

My week was a blur of 3 a.m. Christmas eves and 1 a.m. Christmas mornings in waiting rooms of emergency care centers.  You know the drill: 

You stare at fake plants potted in real soil, avoiding eye contact with the woman in the nubby skirt whose dainty tidiness in these wee hours offends you.  Did she really have to put herself together to attend the opening of her purse pup's _Diabetes_?  Couldn't he have slipped into a diabetic coma while she selected complementary pumps?  

Under normal circumstances I'm not so judgmental, but I'd been beating myself stupid with _couldabeen_s and _shouldabeens_ all night, so condemnations I typically reserve for myself spilled out.  (That and every time my eyes contacted another's an undammable flow followed.)  Between self-loathing and fearing-the-worst, I became Joan Rivers.  

Not my best night.

Tonight is a different story.  According to the MRI, there is no brain tumor.  There has been a "brain event."  There is a lesion, the result of a (treatable) stroke or an (even more treatable) fungal infection.  This might not be the beginning of the end.  (My stomach unclenches some typing that.)  

There are other things.  (There always are.)  

They might be bad.  (They might always be.)  

But the same veterinary neurologist who prepped me for the worst on a cold dead Christmas morning is now "cautiously optimistic."  

That's enough for me. 

**UPDATE:** HEADBUTT!

Excellent! Continued good wishes. (That photo makes her look very sweet for a Mean Cat, too.)

That's encouraging.  Four Felines and one Little White Canine are still sending really strong get-better vibes in Rachel's direction ...

I once spent a long night at the University of Pennsylvania's vet hospital.  In the waiting room, I saw a frat boy in a black bomber jacket get out of an expensive looking SUV, talk to the vet about his dog, and calmly refuse to pay for whatever care his dog needed.  It was too expensive.  Put him down.  The dog, despite whatever was the matter, sat eagerly by their side, no doubt waiting to go home with his daddy.  

Now, I understand we all have to make hard decisions as pet partners.  But something about this boy made me want to back his SUV over his skull.  I thought of the scene from the Iliad, where one soldier spears another through the face and plucks him out of a chariot like a fish.  No Christian charity on my part.  

Scott, your post makes me wonder if my feelings arose from the powerlessness I felt while waiting to hear about my cat's condition.  Nothing makes one feel more macho than knowing that one can't even protect a little furry girl.

In any case, following Charlotte's lead, three kitties and two bunnies are sending cosmic vibes of good will to you and the poozle.

That's really good news.  Your previous post was cryptic enough to have me assuming the worst.  

And I think that going a little crazy in the waiting room is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.

September Blue, that's because she was coming at me.  She _adores_ me.  Demands my lap.  It's everyone/thing in the rest of the world she hates.

Charlotte, Human, and Miriam, thanks for your support.  This has been an incredibly difficult time, and the online love has helped immensely.  (I've even gotten phone calls from some of my readers -- and a lurker!?! -- expressing support.  This makes me think it's too easy to find my phone number online, but temporarily happy about that.)

Luther, Christ, what an awful shit ... but in his defense (sorta kinda), he may have been doing the emotional equivalent of yanking off the Band Aid.  I mean, I think the best of people, so long as I can.  This is a weakness.  But I'd like to think that he didn't want to lose face in front of his entourage, and that his heartless display was the result of an intense desire to flee the premise before the waterworks started.  Such is my faith in men.

Justin, I didn't intend on it being cryptic, or at least, no more cryptic than the information I'd received.  I try not to fuck with my commentariat, except, you know, when I tell you that's what I'm doing.

Best hopes for your cat, Scott.  I'm glad that I didn't write something before -- I wasn't sure what was going on, but this while still sad sounds better than what I'd imagined.

I'm very glad that you two get more time together (which is really all we get in this life).  

Best wishes.

Scott, I know it has been a hard week for you, but you have survived and so has Rachel.  She looks so sweet in the photo, but we know how mean she can be. I have a few scars to prove it. You now have time to love her until she is no longer here. Treasure it because it may be short (remember pokey). You now have time alone with the "first love" in your life because your wife is still away and I am sure Rachel is happy to be the only woman in the house. I am hoping your new year is better then the last year and I am sure it will be if you truly believe it will be better (Just some junk from the book "The Secret" or whatever it is called.

The mutts and I are sending good thoughts as well, Hanna especially, as she has a bit of a kitty fetish.  :)
