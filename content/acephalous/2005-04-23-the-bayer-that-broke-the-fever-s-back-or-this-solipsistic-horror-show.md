This entry belongs to the solipsistic horror show that 99%!o(MISSING)f the bloggers out there write, produce and direct daily: 

I will now inform you about how I'm feeling and account, in excruciating detail, why I feel that way.  I will begin each sentence with a personal pronoun.  I will follow some personal pronouns with a stative verb.  (I think these stative verbs will help you to learn what I'm thinking and how I feel about whatever it is.)  I will follow others with auxillary verbs indicating when I thought or believed such-and-such about my welfare.  I will, in short, tell you all about how I had pneumonia but no longer do; how I had an invasive fungal infection in my liver but no longer do; and how I had a thyroid tumor but no longer do.  I will tell you these things because I will pretend with much determination--evidenced as always by occasional strains and gruntings, as if I were lifting a fridge from the leg of a boy with cancer of testicles that have yet to descend--that's right, I will pretend with an ignorance born of effort and purpose that I don't know that you don't care about the minutae of my daily life.  Because why would you, dear reader, unless you belong to the small passel of acephalites to which I too belong...[.](http://www.popdex.com)

...but belong only because I could not lead.  Leadership being the one quality  groups so defined can never hope to acquire.   So, in closing, my febrile mind has been beaten back and I'm almost myself again.  I plan on blogging the fuck out of this blog as soon as I concoct for my students a suitably absurd story about where I've been for the past week and why I've been there.
