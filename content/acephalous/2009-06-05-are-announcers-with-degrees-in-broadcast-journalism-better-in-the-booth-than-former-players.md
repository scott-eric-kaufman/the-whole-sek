## Are announcers with degrees in broadcast journalism better in the booth than former players?

In the early days of radio and television, baseball announcers fell
into their jobs. Mel Allen, "the Voice of the Yankees," was a lawyer by
trade; his partner, Red Barber, caught his break while working as a
janitor at a college radio station. (A professor scheduled to read
"Certain Aspects of Bovine Obstretics" never showed, so Barber picked
up the microphone and read it himself.) Jimmy Dudley majored in
chemistry, got drafted and, like Harry Kalas, began his broadcasting
career calling intramural games in the South Pacific during WWII.
Although all four of them belong to the Baseball Hall of Fame, they
were amateurs.

The first great professional announcer, Vin Scully, studied
broadcast journalism at Fordham. Following Scully's success on both
coasts, team owners and network executives decided that games were best
called by people whose sober, understated delivery betrayed an intimate
knowledge of the technical limitations of their equipment. No matter
where in America you turned on your radio or television in the 1960s,
you were listening to a college graduate whose vocal coach had taught
him to speak the smooth, unaccented English of an imaginary Middle
America. 

With the exception of a few token athletes, like Joe Garagiola and Bob Uecker, by the early 1970s the voices that spoke _for_ the game weren't the voices _of_
the game. Because the game on the field is so different from the one
observed from the booth, I think it best that there be someone up there
who, for example, understands _in his bones_ that the depth of
field required to keep both the pitcher and the batter (60 feet 6
inches away) in focus makes a 67 m.p.h. curveball look slow even
though, were it a car, it would have exceeded the interstate speed
limit in ninety-percent of the country. 

I would hope that a wise former baseball player, with the richness
of his playing experiences, would more often than not reach a better
conclusion about a game situation than someone who hasn't lived the
life. But I'm not so myopic as to believe that others of different
experiences or backgrounds are incapable of understanding the game.
Many are so capable. [Gary Cohen](http://www.nypost.com/seven/05152009/photos/gary\_cohen.jpg) could only play in Soviet Russia—when he picks up a bat, it swing hims—yet he is a tremendous announcer. 

However, for someone who didn't play the game to understand its
nuances takes time and effort, something that not all people are
willing to give. Personal experiences influence the facts that
announcers chooses to discuss. But this is not to say that only former
players can understand the game. Sometimes they emphasize their own
experience to the exclusion of others, as is the case with Tim
McCarver, for whom baseball has not changed one iota since the day he
retired in 1979, and Joe Morgan, whose greatness on the diamond is
inversely proportional to his awfulness in the booth. For a former
player to become a good announcer, he must extrapolate from his
experiences into areas which with he is unfamiliar. Because what comes
naturally to white, colleged-educated, broadcast journalism majors
might not come easy to a poor kid from Oakland nicknamed "Mex."

This is why the best 
Supreme Court
 broadcast team working today consists of [Gary, Keith, and Ron](http://www.pitchinforagoodcause.org/).

WTF?  This is supposed to be an academic blog.  Bitching about announcers is beneath you.

Uh, you've never seen Scott write about sports before?

I admit that I didn't get it (since Scott writes about baseball periodically, I didn't think too hard about it) until I saw the comments at EotAW, but it's a satire -- a wonderfully banal one -- about the mock outrage being marketed by Republicans on Sotomayor's views on ethnicity and experience.

And yet, every word contained within is absolutely, incontrovertibly true to its avowed subject.

Jerry Remy (Red Sox)! Not only is he a former player who is a greatly insightful broadcaster, he is also amazing to listen to in long blowout games where by the 8th or 9th (or maybe even the 7th), you suspect he and Don may be a little high.
