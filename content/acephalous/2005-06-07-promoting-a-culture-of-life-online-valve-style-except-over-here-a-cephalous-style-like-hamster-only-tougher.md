[Many](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/promoting\_a\_culture\_of\_life\_online\_valve\_style/&gt;http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the\_little\_professor/2005/06/well\_yessss.html), [many](http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/002104.html), [many](http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/12320.html) people linked to [the article](http://chronicle.com/jobs/2005/06/2005060601c.htm) in [_The Chronicle of Higher Education_](http://chronicle.com/) on “Academic Flame Wars.” To my mind, Miriam hits the nail on the head when she says “It’s not clear what we’re supposed to learn from this article. That people are sometimes nasty to each other in online environments? That discussion groups aren’t necessarily warm and cuddly? That spending time online can distract you from other pursuits?  I could have sworn that most of us knew these things already.” As a description of the way people relate online, Mr. Mendelsohn’s account is as accurate as any.  For those impressed by its profundities, well, you and I should have words about the sky (still up), the seas (still water), food (still edible) and television (still unbearable).\* For the rest of you, the real issue in this article is accountability.

The first thing you notice when reading it is that its pseudonymous author, Alan Mendelsohn, appears to have played no part in the various skirmishes he describes.  He’s an innocent bystander in a violent, hostile (and presumably unmoderated) forum.  Perhaps Mr. Mendelsohn really did stand on the sidelines and watch as his department-mates tore into each other.  In his account, at least, he isn’t a major player.  He’s no tire-iron wieldin’ “Brian” who, “in a bizarre performance...vaulted into the discussion to announce that Dave was ‘the boy who cried racism.’” As the final paragraph makes perfectly clear, he’d like his audience to believe he’s the one who “plaintively” asks “Am I the only who that has papers to write?” (I don’t buy that someone would be moved, at least “a year later,” to write an anonymous column in _The Chronicle_ if he hadn’t a stake in the affair.) He’d participate in these discussions, he’d have us believe, but he’s too busy 
drafting a criticism of a theoretical trend that you’re bored with the essay by the time it appears in a peer-reviewed journal, but at least you’ve produced something more lasting than a blog-delivered, “You think you’re so sympathetic to the oppressed, Dr. New Historicist, but when it comes to labor activism in the community, you’re a no-show."

I’m circling back to that.  When he conflates an official departmental listserv and a blog--"my department’s online discussion group for graduate students, which often doubled as a blog in that students made six- or seven-paragraph comments about various topics"--he makes a category error that his brief mention of McLuhan should’ve warned him away from: different media, different ball-game.  An official departmental listserv, comprised of people you meet and interact with on a regular basis, and in which matters are discussed serially but in such a way that previous bits of the conversation are lost in the noise that follow, well, that’s entirely different from a blog in which everyone’s words are right painfully present.  They make themselves known by virtue of their permanence.  To misconstrue someone’s point is to risk being called out for misconstruing it because _it’s right there for everyone to see_. When the obvious is unavoidable, the misunderstandings are likely to be less egregious, less enduring and less heated.  A departmental community is a closed system; a blog is an open system, one in which anyone can pop their level, disinterested head and inform all aggreived parties about the present, grossly engorged status of their molehills.  (Given the nature of these debates, all possible pun intended.) Why, do you ask, am I personally so invested in this?  

In [the-thread-that-refused-to-die](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/same\_senseless\_ramblings\_slightly\_bigger\_stage\_or\_intellectual\_investments/#comments),  [replying](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/same\_senseless\_ramblings\_slightly\_bigger\_stage\_or\_intellectual\_investments/#1587) to Jonathan’s misunderstood estimation of my intellectual abilities--I said “misunderstood,” mind you, not “incorrect"--I remarked 
as for you indicating that I’m potentially “cartoonishly arrogant and ignorant,” I mean, c’mon: I have thicker skin, and I know you can do better than that.  I think these conversations succeed or fail based on how much benefit of the doubt’s ladled out.  I’m all for a liberal ladlin’...even if, at times, doing so requires ignoring what may be perceived as slights (personal or intellectual).

The problems that Mr. Mendelsohn identifies with the listserv format are the result of the ingrained group dynamics of people who’ve come, for largely institutional reasons, to interpret their colleagues’ words in the least flattering and most inflammatory manner possible.  There is absolutely no reason to sanction--as _The Chronicle_, by publishing this op-ed, appears to--similar conclusions about what happens on blogs.  We can decide, en masse, in the interest of the general productivity of discussions, to be generous readers of each other’s posts and comments; or we can coast on reflex and reflux and become Mr. Mendelsohn’s caricatures.  Over the next few months we’ll be discussing issues as inflammatory as those Mr. Mendelsohn’s constructs discussed--race and union action--and we’ll probably feel as strongly about these issues as Mendelsohn’s caricatures no doubt felt about theirs.  The question is, when these issues arise, what do you do?  [What...do...you...do?](http://www.homevideos.com/freezeframes1122/speed44-b.jpg)

You seem to have a superfluous www.http.com in your "Yonder" link.

So anyway, about the article you link to. It's, uh, it's a joke, right? I especially like the part where someone goes, "Diversity is good. Hegemony is bad." then says, "Now, /about/ making certain that nobody who we fundamentally disagree with will be hired... that's what we're all united for, right?"

David, it's not a joke.  That all actually happened.  Someone actually said, _very sarcastically_, "diversity is good, hegemony is bad."  You might even know that someone.  (He didn't mean it sarcastically, no doubt, but said it in that sarcastic-because-it's-so-blindingly-obvious way that people sometimes say things.)
