## "I'm only racist on my mother's side. My father's people were misanthropes."

That Brevard Community College [will be firing Sharon Sweet for compelling her students to vote for Obama](http://dailycaller.com/2013/02/18/college-fire-professor-who-forced-students-to-vote-for-obama/) is, of course, evidence that such indoctrination is ubiquitous in contemporary academia. The first comment on that _Daily Caller_ link states the case in its strongest form:

Liberal fascism at home on every campus.

Exactly! Those two words always [belong next to each other](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/i-recognize-i-c.html)
 on campus. Goes without saying. What I find interesting about this 
story is that there’s no racial angle to it. Sweet’s race is never 
mentioned in the article nor does a search turn up an image that’s 
unequivocally of her. But Jim Hoft _knows_ what she must look like, so when he did a Google Image search for “[Sharon Sweet](https://www.google.com/search?q=%!s(MISSING)haron+sweet%!&(MISSING)num=100&hl=en&safe=off&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=8YciUay\_N8HqiwLaoIAo&ved=0CEcQsAQ&biw=1280&bih=651)” he carefully considered all of the faces that might be hers and [went with his gut](http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2013/02/college-recommends-dismissal-for-professor-who-made-students-sign-pledge-for-obama/).

That it told him she must be the black woman in the mug shot doesn’t 
make Hoft himself a racist—just his gut. Which makes him, what? About 
thirty percent racist?

The comments at The Gateway Pundit are fun too. One of them suggests that Sweet's "teachers license" should be revoked. And these are the people who think we should listen to them when they natter on about higher education.

That said, I'm absolutely boggled by the effort of trying to imagine what Sweet could have been thinking. If the story is true, she risked her career for an utterly futile gesture. She must have known that there was no way to check whether her students followed through on their 'pledge', regardless of what they might have signed their names to. Either something more is going on here or this is the most egregious bit of politicized stupidity I've seen from a community college professor since Donald Douglas babbled about "Sasquatch Israel".
