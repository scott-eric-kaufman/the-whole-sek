			[Miriam](http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the\_little\_professor/2010/05/at-the-dawn-of-time.html) and [Alyssa](http://alyssarosenberg.blogspot.com/2010/05/amazon-meme.html) suggest we all admit to the first order we ever placed with Amazon.  I comply more out of curiosity than a deep need to run with the cool kids.  Needless to say, the [two](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004TJV6/diesekoschmar-20) [items](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674006712/diesekoschmar-20) Amazon shipped me in 2000 tell you everything you need to know to understand who I was a decade ago.

"What Liberal Media", believe it or not. I paid the new hardbound price for it too (it goes for $4 now). Back in those days I paid attention to optimistic mainstream guys like Alterman.

3 B5 novels. Not sure what that says about me except that I couldn't get them locally.

Hah! Haunted by Palahnuik and McEwan's Child in Time. In general, it appears 2005 was dominated by comic books and things Joss Whedon was involved in. 

I did not know you could even do this.

In '99, my first order was the Spit on a Stranger EP by Pavement and The Onion book, Our Dumb Century.

I was just too cool for school.

My first order, part way throu my first year of grad school, was a used copy of [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0472094440/ref=oss\_product).  To be honest, I'm not sure that I've ever read it all the way through.  The next order was [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691019436/ref=oss\_product), which is a little more theory-dorktacular (OK, not entirely; I'm a historian, afterall).

The comments thread on that Hardt and Negri vol. is like a Socratic dialogue doubling as a primer in recent Marxist theory. (_Plato_: H&N cannot escape an Althusserian double-bind and will only drive readers away rrom Marx.  _Socrates_: this books sucks! It's horid!)

[September 27, 1998.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1561840033/ref=oss\_product)  Did I take it seriously?  Um...yes and no.  Am I slightly less flaky these days?  See previous answer.

I looked at this the other day. 

Apparently I was slow to use Amazon. My memory is that half.com was a better source for most of the books I was interested in and, at that point, I was resisting creating accounts at too many vendors.

My first orders where in 2002, and were a couple of new gaming books that were 30%!o(MISSING)ff at Amazon. In 2002 and 2003 I ordered the Transhuman Space core book, the d20 Monster Manual (I cringe slightly to see that) and the GURPS 4E Core books.

I forgot one, I also ordered _Girls Can Tell_ by Spoon.

Also, something is messed up in their database, because looking at my order history I see one order that has the following summary information:

#   Recipient:   NickS   

# Shipping Speed: Two-Day Shipping  

# Order Total: $-688,229,647.04

Looking in even more detail, I see that this is the line that is causing the total to be off:

Estimated Tax:  	$-688,229,693.47

You would think that, since I was in the same state as Amazon, they would have been able to calculate the tax more accurately than that.

You know, now that I'm looking at it, my history's not quite accurate either.  For example:

![image](http://acephalous.typepad.com/no.JPG)

That wasn't me, officer.  You must have me confused with someone else.  (This isn't me not owning up to having a copy of _Dianetics_, either.  I never purchased the book, no matter what Amazon insists.)

Just pay the tax and shut up, Nick. We all have to make some sacrifices.

I remember that I asked Amazon to delete my purchase history when they announced that they were changing their privacy policy and considering it business information that could be sold.  They refused to.  So I think I settled for deleting my account, even though my history was still in their database.

Years later, in 2005, I was momentarily cash-poor and another family member wanted a router, so I signed up again to get one  cheaply.  My first purchase after that was Adam's book \_Stone\_.

_you were in that seminar too, right?_

That'd be Schwab's, right?  I remember that seminar, if not distinctly, at the very least well.  It's what actually turned a budding Deleuzian against "the project of theory," as she called it.

Buffy & "Empire", eh? A pretty eclectic mix, about what I might expect from you...

Me? Two extremely dry texts, 1 on Patial Diff EQs and another on PDEs in Hilbert Space.  But I jazzed the order up with a few music CD's such as Louis Armostrong, The Birds, Muddy Waters, and a couple of Terrence Hill movies-the "Trinity" twin pack and "My name is Nobody".
