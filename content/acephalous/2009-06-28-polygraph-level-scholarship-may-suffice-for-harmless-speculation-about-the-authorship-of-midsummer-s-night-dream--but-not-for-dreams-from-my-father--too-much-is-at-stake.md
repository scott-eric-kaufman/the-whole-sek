## “Polygraph-level scholarship may suffice for harmless speculation about the authorship of <em>Midsummer’s Night Dream</em>, but not for <em>Dreams From My Father</em>. Too much is at stake.”

As all actual, practicing literary critics know, few sentences in critical works scream tendentiousness louder than:

What should be transparent to any literary critic is that . . .

Literary matters are only "transparent" when they're not properly
literary. If something is transparent, you don't need a literary critic
to ponder the depths it doesn't have—any old idiot will suffice. And
that's exactly why [Jack Cashill](http://www.cashill.com/about/index.htm), author of [the above](http://www.americanthinker.com/2009/06/breakthrough\_on\_the\_authorship\_1.html) and [an idiot of long-standing](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/10/who-really-wrot.html), is just the man to prove that Bill Ayers wrote Obama's autobiography, _Dreams From My Father_.
For Cashill and his mysterious contributors ("[t]he media punishment
that Joe the Plumber received" requires they remain anonymous), the
case against Obama is a compelling one:

What Mr. Midwest noticed recently is that both Ayers in [_A Kind and Just Parent_] and Obama in [_Dreams From My Father_]
make reference to the poet Carl Sandburg. In itself, this is not a
grand revelation. Let us call it a C-level match. Obama and Ayers seem
to have shared the same library in any case . . . Ayers and Obama,
however, go beyond citing Sandburg. Each quotes the opening line of his
poem "[Chicago](http://carl-sandburg.com/chicago.htm)"
. . . This I would call a B-level match. What raises it up a notch to
an A-level match is the fact that both misquote "Chicago," and they do
so in exactly the same way.

So both Ayers and Obama misquote the opening line of Carl Sandburg's "Chicago," substituting "hog butcher _to_ the world" for "hog butcher _for_
the world." This mutual error would be significant (an "A-level match")
if Ayers and Obama were the only two people who ever made it, but
according to Google Book Search—a secret search engine to which only
I have access—the same mistake has been made by [Nelson Algren](http://books.google.com/books?id=4xbgml7gD1kC&pg=PA251&dq=), [Alan Lomax](http://books.google.com/books?id=pm04AAAAIAAJ&q=), [Andrei Codrescu](http://books.google.com/books?id=FvYF9QxKH-UC&pg=PP1&dq=), [H.L.

(To name [but a few](http://books.google.com/books?q=%!h(MISSING)og+butcher+to+the+world%!)(MISSING).) According to Cashill, I have now proven that _Dreams From My Father_ was written by many a dead man of American letters, a [living](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/06/polygraphlevel-scholarship-may-suffice-for-harmless-speculation-about-the-authorship-of-midsummers-n.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef01157181b597970b#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01157181b597970b) mystery writer, a _New York Times_ columnist and the 1967 Illinois Commission on Automation and Technological Progress. That bears repeating:

I have an "A-level match" that proves that Obama's autobiography was
written by a "study of the economic and social effects of automation
and other technological changes on industry, commerce, agriculture,
education, manpower, and society in Illinois" when Obama was only six
years old.  If that somehow fails to convey to the dubious merits of
Cashill's argument, perhaps this will:

Returning to the exotic, in his Indonesian backyard
Obama discovered two "birds of paradise" running wild as well as
chickens, ducks, and a "yellow dog with a baleful howl." In [Ayers'] _Fugitive Days_, there is even more "howling" than there is in _Dreams_ . . . In [_A Kind and Just Parent_], he talks specifically about a "yellow dog." And he uses the word "baleful" to describe an "eye" in _Fugitive Days_. For the record, "baleful" means "threatening harm." I had to look it up.

You did read that right. Cashill did cite as "A-level" evidence the
fact that Ayers and Obama used a word he didn't know, despite his being
the Executive Editor of Kansas City’s premier business publication, _Ingram’s Magazine_; despite his having written for _Fortune_, _The Wall Street Journal_, _The Washington Post_, and _The Weekly Standard_; despite his having authored five books of non-fiction; and despite the word "baleful" having appeared in print **[
342 times
](http://acephalous.typepad.com/files/342.jpg)** in the past six months alone. Granted, all those appearances were in high-minded literary publications like _Newsday_ ("[w]ith his baleful countenance, wild hair, sonorous baritone and sage pronouncements") or leftist rags like _The Washington Times_
("warn them in baleful tones if they've forgotten, say, the
Constitution"), so it would be unreasonable to expect Cashill to have
been familiar with the word . . . or would be, were it not for the fact
that it also appears **[19 times](http://www.google.com/search?q=site:http://www.americanthinker.com/+baleful&hl=en&safe=off)** in the pages of the _American Thinker_, the publication for which Cashill penned this tripe. (Seems he can begin his careful literary analysis of the other [848,000 potential ghost writers](http://www.google.com/search?q=baleful) closer to home.)

Fortunately for Cashill, his argument is not entirely based on
demonstrations of ignorance and popular misquotations (which, when you
think about it, is more along the lines of literary _detection_ than literary _criticism_
anyway), as when he claims that Ayers and Obama are unique among
memoirists in their fascination with eyes: "Ayers is fixated with
faces, especially eyes [and] Obama is also fixated with faces,
especially eyes." Having performed an extensive study of
autobiographical writing, Cashill knows how unique this fixation with
eyes is. Consider this passage from _Dreams From My Father_:

Peter said Peter said eyes are always and eyes are
always. Peter said Peter said, eyes are always and Peter said eyes are
always. Peter said eyes are always. Peter said eyes are always.

Sorry—that was Gertrude Stein. Here's the passage from _Dreams From My Father_:

Whenever I looked in her direction she had her eyes on
me. The face she had! The eyes! She lay streched out on the floorboards
with her hands under her head and her eyes closed. Sun blazing down,
bit of a breeze, water nice and lively. I noticed a scratch on her
thigh and asked her how she came by it. Picking gooseberries, she said.
I said again I thought it was hopeless and no good going on, and she
agreed, without opening her eyes. I asked her to look at me and after a
few moments—after a few moments she did, but the eyes just slits,
because of the glare. I bent over her to get them in the shadow and
they opened. Let me in. We drifted in among the flags and stuck. The
way they went down, sighing, before the stem! The eyes she had!

Sorry—that was [Samuel Beckett](https://www.msu.edu/%!E(MISSING)sullivan/BeckettKrapp.html).
If I didn't know better, I'd be inclinced to argue that works that are
overtly concerned with the act of remembering and the limitations of
memory tend to obsess over the eye and its punned hononym ("I").
Actually, I do know better, so I will: be they modernist
experimentations about subjectivity or humble autobiographies, works
that concern themselves with the act of remembering and the limitations
of memory tend to obsess over the eye and its punned homonym ("I").

Perhaps it's unfair of a professional literary critic to expect
Cashill to have intimate knowledge of literary modernism. I should cut
him some slack and let him perform the kind of close stylistic analysis
that I teach my students. Maybe he can handle something simple, like
diction:

To this point, I have just skimmed the 759 items in the
bill of particulars in my case against Obama's literary genius. Not
familiar with the term "bill of particulars?" Uncertain myself, I
looked that one up too. It means a list of written statements made by a
party to a court proceeding. Ayers and Obama each refer knowingly to a
"bill of particulars." Doesn't everyone?

The answer, of course, is no.

Cashill is on to something here. The phrase "bill of particulars" is
an uncommon construction, and its repeated use indicates that the
speaker has a specialized vocabulary in which this construction
regularly appears. According to LexisNexis, this is exactly the case:
in the past six months, that exact phrase has been written **[
509 times
](http://acephalous.typepad.com/files/billofparticulars.jpg)** and every single one of them looks like this:

United States v. Clark, NO. 05-6507, UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT, 09a0422n.06;, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS
12940; 2009 FED App. 0422N (6th Cir.), June 15, 2009, Filed, NOT
RECOMMENDED FOR FULL-TEXT PUBLICATION. SIXTH CIRCUIT RULE 28(g) LIMITS
CITATION TO SPECIFIC SITUATIONS. PLEASE SEE RULE 28(g) BEFORE CITING IN
A PROCEEDING IN A COURT IN THE SIXTH CIRCUIT. IF CITED, A COPY MUST BE
SERVED ON OTHER PARTIES AND THE COURT. THIS NOTICE IS TO BE PROMINENTLY
DISPLAYED IF THIS DECISION IS REPRODUCED.

The only people who regularly use the phrase "bill of particulars," then, are _lawyers_, and since Bill Ayers isn't a lawyer, I think we can all agree that Cashill is right: Obama _is_ the author of Bill Ayers' _Fugitive D_—_wait a minute_!

Great takedown, SEK.  I'd add, about this part:

_And he uses the word "baleful" to describe an "eye" in Fugitive Days._

I'd hazard a guess that "baleful" is used to describe an eye, a glance, a gaze, a glare, or some other ocular noun more than any other class of noun.  By now, "baleful" practically means "Hostile, esp. of the eyes or gaze."  Far from being some proof of authorship, it's actually a near-cliche.

Ah, now that's some good snark.

Interestingly, I'm fairly sure that baleful came from the Celtic myth of Balor, the Firbolg (giant) king, who had one giant eye that would slay anyone who it looked upon, who slew Nuada of the Silver Arm, and was in turn slain by Lugh, the son of the Sun. 

Ah, I spent my childhood well.

The baleful eye ... of Sauron!  Clearly this proves that Tolkien created Obama.  It's the Orcification of America!

This must be satire.

_Given Obama's age, "Mekong Delta" was not likely a part of his vocabulary, but that does not stop him from writing about "the angry young men in Soweto or Detroit or the Mekong Delta."_

Anyone younger than 50 has never heard of the Mekong Delta.  True Fact!

_And he uses the word "baleful" to describe an "eye" in Fugitive Days._

tomemos, I almost snarked about Obama and Ayers having a penchant for "eyes" instead of eyes, but that seemed one step too far.  

_the Stein-Beckett-Obama connection is chilling_

Ahem:

Being President is funny being yourself is funny as you are never yourself to yourself except as you remember yourself and then of course you do not believe yourself to be the President . . . you do not really believe yourself why should you, you know so well so very well that the President is not yourself, the President could not be yourself because you cannot remember right and if you do remember right it does not sound right and of course it does not sound right because it is not right.  You are of course never the President to yourself because you are black and have a funny name.

_That's weird. I (StevenAttewell) wrote that last line._

And the others one too, right Steven?  I think I'm missing something (or TypePad's HTML is screwy again).

_What, no quotes from Georges Bataille? Aren't they teaching you literary types the classics anymore?_

Ben, normally people ask whether I named the blog [after Bataille](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ac%!C(MISSING)3%!A(MISSING)9phale), not whether I'm familiar with him.  Which I am, mind you, but us fancy folks aren't supposed to admit we've read voyeuristic novels that border on pornography (unless they're written by Joyce).

_One of Cashill's books is entitled How Intellectual Hucksters Have Hijacked American Culture, and should probably be subtitled The Jack Cashill Story._

CP for the win!

_Anyone younger than 50 has never heard of the Mekong Delta. True Fact!_

Well, duh.  Wait, what was that?  Swift boat what?  Huh?  Anyway, yes, Cashill for the win!

I think the consensus is that I read Jonah and he [pretends to have never read me](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/i-recognize-i-c.html).  

_Ed McBain is not a "living mystery writer." He's a dead one._

I thought Evan Hunter died, but "Ed McBain" lived on---that seems not to be the case.  I must be thinking of some other immortal pseudonym.

_I'm fairly sure that baleful came from the Celtic myth of Balor..._

Probably not. Bale, in the sense baleful uses, comes from Anglo Saxon via the proto-Germanic _\*balwom_. Cognate with Old High Germanic _balo_, Old Frisian _balu_ and Old Norse _bol_. Most likely derived from the PIE base _\*bheleu-_ "to beat."

I do not know for sure but I'd hazard to guess that Balor, like the Norse Baldr, derives from a root word for "prince" or "lord" that also gave Old English the word _baeldor_. Most likely the PIE root _\*bhel-_, "to swell (with strength or pride)".

I'd be surprised if the semitic _baal_ had anything to do with it (baleful or balor that is), but it's not outside the realms of possibility what with Phoenician traders visiting Britain as early as 1500 BCE and Celtic raiders troubling Anatolia from the 5th century BCE onwards.

Minor point, perhaps, but neither Obama nor Ayers "misquote" Sanders. In both of the examples (see Cashill's original article), they reference the notion, introduced by Sanders but long since entered into the vernacular, that Chicago is hog butcher to the world. Like saying the Midwest is the breadbasket to the country or that Wasilla is the meth lab to Alaska.

"I thought Evan Hunter died, but "Ed McBain" lived on---that seems not to be the case. I must be thinking of some other immortal pseudonym."

Nope, I'm pretty sure nobody has as yet taken up the "Ed McBain" mantel, but even if somebody had it'd still be false or, at the very best, highly misleading to say "Ed McBain is a living mystery writer" (if I published a book under the pseudonym "Mark Twain" with the permission of his estate, would that make "Mark Twain is a living American writer" a true proposition?)  

Incidently, "Evan Hunter" is also a pseudonym.  His real name was Salvatore Lombino.

Point taken, post corrected.  (Though that sentence loses some zing, damn it, but better to be accurate than stylish.)

Cool. I visit a link from Salon and wind up on the blog of an RLPAer!
