The genetic (linguistic) connection between the US Southern and North English accents would have to make it easier than, say, a New York or Valley Girl sound. 

That said, van Dyke does have a lot to answer for. _I_ do better English accents.

I think "Deep South" is the go-to accent for the Brits when they're portraying American Christian nutcases. But seriously though, how is _Spooks_ like _Leverage_? The obvious comparison to me is that _Spooks_ is like _24_ if the writers were very clever but also hated the audience just a bit.

That's probably why Brits don't get American race politics. To them, with their Ken Burns addled minds, there is no black or white, only sepia.

I am watching _Spooks_ via Netflix streaming _right now_ and attest that at least through the middle of the third season it's nothing like _Leverage_.  I endorse Paul's assessment; it's like _24_, but more clever, less over the top, and slightly hateful.  I'm getting weirded out with how the individual characters get their most challenging and dramatic episodes immediately before they leave the show.  Also, I think Tom Quinn would have had better luck in love if once, just once, he'd said something like "For fuck's sake!  I _really wanted to see you_, I wanted it much more than what I was actually doing!  BUT I WAS STOPPING AN ASSAULT ON A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  I HAD to miss our date.  I know it's difficult but you cannot, as a rational adult, blame me for this.  I will buy you flowers.  Surely you can understand."

I've been sicker than I've been in years this past week---as you might could tell by the "quality" of my voice in that clip---but I've half-drafted a post on the _Spooks_/_Leverage_ connection that I'll have up as soon as I finish marking this stack of Research Reports.

My wife had been in LA that day, got home after I'd gone to bed (about 7 p.m.), and when I talked to her about it, she asked me where I got that clip . . . so yes, good thing I'm teaching online right now, as I've been without a real voice for much more than a minute at a time for the better part of a week now.
