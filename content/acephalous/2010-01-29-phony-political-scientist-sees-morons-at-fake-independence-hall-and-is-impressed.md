With all apologies to J.D. Salinger, I can't resist reading Donald Douglas's [account](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/rally-at-independence-hall-michele.html)
of a Michele Bachmann event at Knott's Berry Farm in Holden Caulfield's
terms. This is contemporary conservatism boiled to the bone: some
morons convince a phony of their patriotism by speaking before a
replica of an actual American institution. Douglas's photo-essay
captures what history signifies when you subscribe to Tea Party logic
even more starkly than those fake patriots who demonstrate their
solidarity with the Founding Fathers by showing up at rallies with
tea-bags.

Did I say rallies? I meant "sparsely-attended speeches
by purported conservative celebrities in the most conservative county
in the country," because as Douglas's own photos [attest](http://i80.photobucket.com/albums/j186/DonaldDouglas/Americaneocon/Michelle%!B(MISSING)achmann%!R(MISSING)ally/BachmannIndependenceHallRally002-1.jpg), David Horowitz and Michele Bachmann have little drawing power _within spitting distance of the birth place of Richard Nixon_.
Not that Douglas would care, mind you, because he can't tear his
authentic eyes away from all the ersatz history. Even his grammar
becomes ambiguous in the presence of all this fakery:
As
you can see, the park's Independence Hall is an exact replica of the
original historic landmark in Philadelphia, PA. Both the Declaration of
Independence and the U.S. Constitution were signed there.The
Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were signed in
Knott's Berry Farm's Independence Hall? According to Knott's Berry
Farm, they most certainly were:

[a] shot of the [Knott's Berry Farm's replica of the] bell's famous crack.The faked crack on the fake Liberty Bell is famous? All morons hate it when their grammar reveals that they're morons.  

Not that it's just the grammar, as his caption to [this picture](http://i80.photobucket.com/albums/j186/DonaldDouglas/Americaneocon/Michelle%!B(MISSING)achmann%!R(MISSING)ally/BachmannIndependenceHallRally010-1.jpg)
demonstrates: "[t]he sweeties at the gift counter, in 18th century
dress." If you press your ear against the monitor, you can almost hear
him declaiming: "That _is too_ an authentic 18th century
windbreaker!" But perhaps the best part of Douglas's account is the
definitive evidence that Tea Party patriots don't know from English. He
notes that Michele Bachmann  
came to California straight
from Washington and the last night's SOTU. She reminded the crowd that
this time last year the big talk was Joe Wilson's "you lie," while this
week it's Samuel Alito's "not true," and she turned that into a little
chant to fire up the patriots in attendence.

If that
chant sounds like Douglas suggests it does—"You lie! Not true! You lie!
Not true!"—then those patriots sure told Joe Wilson a thing or two.

Update.  
If you're going to [pretend to be an academic](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/scott-eric-kaufman-if-you-smear-my.html), Donald Douglas, you shouldn't link to [something](http://acephalous.typepad.com/about.html)
that says I'm a "Doctor of Philosophy of English," then write that I
claim to have "a Ph.D. in the 'Philosophy of English.'"  People who work in
academia should, after all, know what the letters "[Ph.D.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor\_of\_Philosophy)"
stand for.  Moreover, survival in academia requires the actual
refutation of points.  It's cute that you noticed I made two
typographical errors, but neither error was material to my argument,
the substance of which you've yet to refute.

I don't know, offhand, where to look to answer the of/in question. Google returns more hits for in, but enough of hits to make it a credible, formal, alternative. The Chicago Manual, perhaps? Mine's in the office, as are my diplomas.

By the way, I don't think he's pretending to be an academic. I think he's [in one of the least intellectual, most partisan fields in the academy](http://www.blogger.com/profile/18236333181889271910) and proud of it.

Since there's a little bit of the hominim going around, I'll quote from the [Rate my Professor](http://ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=308510&page=3) page for Dr. Douglas

"The dude is from pure loserville, he sounds like a lib, claims to be a republican, puts way too much personal anger in the class, he hates it if you disagree, will make your life miserable if you do. One of the worst professors I ever saw."

I'd like to read a lot into this, but alas, some practices are far too destructive.
