## Spencer Ackerman is (a) what the world needs now, (b) a new Frank Sinatra, (c) the bane of my existence, or (d) all of the above.

It goes without saying—or _should_—that [Spencer Ackerman](http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/) is a national treasure.  I never comment over there because of [one of the folks who does](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/06/arooga-arooga-arooga-arooga.html),
but Spencer damn near tops my increasingly shorter list of essential morning
reads.  That said, on those days I don’t have time to read in the
mornings, I don’t—_because I_ _can’t_—read him at all.  My brain translates this:

![attackerman](http://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/attackerman1.jpg?w=309&h=130 "attackerman")

Into this:

[![attackerman02](http://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/attackerman023.jpg?w=450&h=250 "attackerman02")](http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2009/07/09/rip285/)

And I just can’t sleep once I’ve see that.  

(_This is less of a post
and more of a frank admission of admiration.  If all his peers had half
his tenacity, DeLong could excise one [loathsome category](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/better\_press\_corps/) from his site_.)

Agreed on all points. You know you can turn off the unread count in your google rss? I find its absence very comforting, particularly when it comes to Ackerman and, uh, boing boing. Sorry.

I like Spencer a lot too. But I have to admit that part of what's addictive about his work is that he's a master of rhetorical urgency, to whip up your appetite for the Inspector-General's report or a Crappy Hour chat on Jezebel.

I thought it went "When there's nothing left to burn you set yourself on fire."

Also, folk singer, hole in head.
