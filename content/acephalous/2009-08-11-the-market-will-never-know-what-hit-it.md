When I try to secure a position as a 19th Century Americanist at the MLA in December, my most prestigious publication will be about:

*   James Joyce, an Irish expatriate
*   the novel _Ulysses_, which was not published in the 19th Century
*   Fredric Jameson, who is American, on imperialism in Ireland, which is not America
*   Walter Benjamin, who is not American, on flânerie in France, which is also not America
*   Jacques Derrida, also not American, on how titles are like the law, which is neither here nor there

I am become a bill of goods.  (Or so it seems to me.)

Yeah, perhaps, but you're still going to be interviewing with _English_ departments, for whom all those names will ring beautiful bells. Plus you've got that dissertation thingy: it's got some American stuff in it, right?

 _it's got some American stuff in it, right?_

Nah. I snuck into SEK's machine and did a search and replace on it to swap out 'Crane' for 'Goethe' and 'the' for 'the wombat.' Should be good for a Bizarro job though.

But I should say, all best on the search, and I hope you land a good one in exactly the region that suits you and yours.

Doesn't that just mean that you can teach still yet more courses for them?  

Ooh, ooh.  When they ask you about your next project, instead of telling them its about how comic books get made into great or terrible movies, with lots of speculation about panels and cameras and stuff, tell them you're pursuing a historically grounded transnational study between Ireland and America of certain literary whatsits in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  When they ask what these certain literary things are, come up with a convincing story involving Joyce, Jameson and some other American, or shout "Hey, look over there!" and then, when there backs are turned, run out of the room.  Hopefully in the confusion they will assume that the interview must already have concluded and remember only this exciting sounding second project.

I recently came across your blog and have been reading along. I thought I would leave my first comment. I don't know what to say except that I have enjoyed reading. Nice blog. I will keep visiting this blog very often.

I'd say you've more chance of a good job his December, SEK, than Melvin has of hawking his email marketing solutions to any of your comments-crowd.

Ouch! Isn't that damning with faint praise? I think SEK is much stronger than that. Good luck Scott!

Weird. This morning I received the [identical comment](http://yolacrary.blogspot.com/2009/08/notes-on-evelyn-scotts-migrations.html) as that left by Melvin, from someone calling herself "Sara", with a link to a seemingly completely unrelated site. In the context it seemed genuine, if somewhat awkward. I don't get it.

Of course, I thought it seemed genuine, but if I'd looked closer at the site I might have had doubts. [This post](http://pianonotes.info/?paged=3) about some band called "the cold play" may have tipped me off about something or other. Sigh.

What? Do you dispute that their release of albums is never-ending in the field of piano playing?

_tell them you're pursuing a historically grounded transnational study between Ireland and America of certain literary whatsits in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries._ 

Oddly, this is sorta almost kinda what I envision my next project to be.  (Hence the interest in the Claybaugh book.)

_Scott, when's the Joyce article gonna be out? Is it JJQ?_

That's a good question.  I'm not sure where the article's going to appear yet.  It may be in a published collection, but it also may be in a journal devoted to a specialist topic.  I'll update as soon as I figure it out.

Well, Scott, you're still better off than a historian who came from an interdisciplinary centre for medieval studies whose grad students tended not to get TAships from the university's history department.\*  You're very very fortunate for all of the teaching you've gotten from UC Irvine.

--------  

\*There's nothing that feels quite as hopeless as trying to spin a CV full of Religion, English, and Latin, and Mediaeval Studies TAships to a history department's search committee.

Andrew, believe you me, I know I'm lucky to have received what I have, as well as to have my current position, which is, I've recently learned, far sweeter than I thought it was---and far sweeter than people receive in other schools in the UC system.
