As the title indicates, the venerable [History Carnival](http://historycarnival.blogsome.com/) will be hosted by Y.T. on Saturday, October 15th.  One of the joys of it will be reading all the historical posts people have yet to send me and skimming the ones hastily delivered to my inbox Friday evening at 11:59 PM.  I suggest that if you've written or read (nominations being equal in stature to shameless self-promotion) anything of even remote (though I'd prefer intense) interest to historians, historicists, intellectual historians, alternative historians (parse as is your wont) or any of the many historical cognates I neglected to name, send me the link sooner than later.  I have a Punch and Judy show of epic proportions planned and celerity guarantees you a meaty role.  (Later may play an extra.  Late will be obscured by one.)
