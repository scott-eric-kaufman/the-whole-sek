## Remembering Whitney Houston

Whitney Houston burst onto the music scene in 1985 with her self-titled LP which had four number one hit singles on it, including “The Greatest Love of All,” “You Give Good Love” and “Saving All My Love for You,” plus it won a Grammy Award for best pop vocal performance by a female and two American Music Awards, one for best rhythm and blues single and another for best rhythm and blues video. She was also cited as best new artist of the year by _Billboard_and by _Rolling Stone_magazine. With all this hype one might expect the album to be an anticlimatic, lackluster affair, but the surprise was that _Whitney Houston_(Arista) was one of the warmest, most complex and altogether satisfying rhythm and blues records of the 1980s and Whitney herself had a voice that defies belief. From the elegant, beautiful photo of her on the cover of the album (in a gown by Giovanne De Maura) and its fairly sexy counterpart on the back (in a bathing suit by Norma Kamali) one knows that this wasn’t going to be a blandly professional affair; the record _was_ smooth but intense and Whitney’s voice leaped across so many boundaries and was so versatile (though she was mainly a _jazz_ singer) that it’s hard to take in the album on a first listening.

“The Greatest Love of All” was one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation and dignity. From the first line (Michael Masser and Linda Creed are credited as the writers) to the last, it was a state-of-the-art ballad about believing in yourself. It was a powerful statement and on that Whitney sung with a grandeur that approached sublime. Its universal message crossed all boundaries and instilled one with the hope that it’s not too late for us to better ourself, to act kinder. Since it’s impossible in the world we live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with ourselves. It was an important message, crucial really, and it was beautifully stated on this album.

After this post, and the Steve Jobs one, and the Michael Jackson one, I kind of want to go back in time and write a post taking the piss out of David Foster Wallace.

(Pardon me; your Steve Jobs commentary wasn't put here. That's my bad.)

I completely missed that this was a quote from American Psycho until I read your most recent post.  

My own memory of Whitney Houston actually goes back to my first date as a university freshman.  Me and a young woman from my dorm went to see The Bodyguard - her idea, not mine.  I've tried to block as much of that film from my memory as possible.  After about a month of dating, I was in her dormroom, when "I Will Always Love You" came on the radio.  It was apparently, our song, and she wanted us to dance to it.  It was an epiphanic moment; we broke up a couple of days later.

Stephen, I'm not sure whether that makes me want to laugh or cry. I mean, I know have some taste issues, but to wax that poetic about Whitney Houston? Come on, man. You know me!

@Stephen,

Irving Berlin: This new tune is called 'I'll Be Loving You Always.'

Kaufman (George S.): "Always" is a bit much, no? How about 'I'll Be Loving You On Thursday'?
