(_[Ben Shapiro](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/author/bshapiro) stands atop a greased hill. He is surrounded by happy children._)

**BEN:**Follow me! I’m one of you!

**THE CHILDREN:**(_Wander hither and thither without any clear plan like kids do._)

**BEN:**Do you not see? [THIS HILL! IS GREASED!](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/bshapiro/2012/02/15/the-horrors-of-hollywood-parenting/)

**THE CHILDREN:**(_Frolic and ignore THE YELLING MAN._)

**BEN THE YELLING MAN:**I WILL SAVE YOU!

**THE CHILDREN:**(_Look at BEN THE YELLING MAN, then remember [what Britney Baxter did](http://z6mag.com/offbeat/walmart-kidnapping-video-of-brittney-baxter-suspect-arrested-165230.html) last week and start screaming and kicking_.)

**BEN THE YELLING MAN:**BUT I’M TRYING TO SAVE YOU FROM YOUR PARENTS!

**THE CHILDREN:**(_Start running near the edge of the greased hill and, one by one, begin sliding down it._)

**BEN THE YELLING MAN:**NO!  (_To his left.)_YOU GOT THE GAY!  (_To his right._) NOW YOU’RE A MAN!  (_Falls to his knees and weeps._) AN IRANIAN? I COULD’VE SAVED YOU!

**JESUS:**(_Descends from Heaven with lights and music and shit._) My child.

**BEN THE YELLING MAN:**(_Too busy yelling._)

**JESUS:**Ben?

**BEN THE YELLING MAN:**(_Too busy yelling._)

**JESUS:**BEN!

**BEN THE YELLING MAN:**(_Shuts up. Turns around._) THIS IS YOUR FAULT HIPPIE!

(_Pushes Jesus down the slippery slope and turns him into a gay. Transgenders him too. Because that’ll teach Him to love all His children._)

THE END

Holy Confirmation Bias, Batman! 

(Evidentiary standards? We don't need no stinkin'.... etc., ad nauseum)

No, I think we need poetry:

"What a scandal" rhetorical twitch  

For conservatives scratching an itch  

When arguing by anecdote  

Everyone's a synecdoche  

When about modern life they must bitch

That's better.
