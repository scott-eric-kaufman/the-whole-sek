## <em>Behold!  The Internet Provides Me Cookies!</em>

[John](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/) once wrote about "[blogging getting results](http://crookedtimber.org/2007/06/11/blogging-gets-results/)," but he never imagined this.  

This afternoon, the cookies I so [desperately desired](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/why-yes-i-have-.html#comment-81074381) were delivered to my door.  [Todd.](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/why-yes-i-have-.html#comment-81076667) was true to his word, providing the wife and I with delicious chocolate-mint-raisin cookies.  

([Sisyphus](http://academiccog.blogspot.com/) can consider her lack of cookies a just punishment for the [water which fell from her heavens](http://academiccog.blogspot.com/2007/08/thunderstorm.html).  Cookies are divine, but as Todd. and I discussed this afternoon, some weather would be nice.)

I can't thank him enough ... although I feel obliged to apologize for the state of my 1) (patchy) beard, 2) book-littered apartment, and 3)  dissertation-preoccupied mind.  

At three in the afternoon, all my thoughts are belong to Twain.

Hah. My beard is pretty similar looking, once every three days. 

Glad you liked the cookies, although they're actually "[Chocolate Fudge Cookies with Toffee and Dried Cherries](http://www.alittlepregnant.com/alittlepregnant/2006/02/being\_julia.html)." The only downside to the whole affair was that my wife ate both of the ones I saved for us before I made it back home.

What?? I go out for dinner and a beer and this happens while I'm gone? (Sniff) Where are \_my\_ cookies? \_Delivered\_ home-baked cookies no less? I am shocked. Shocked, I say! 

Oh wait --- I guess I did have a fortune cookie with my dinner. I couldn't figure out what "you will be awarded the job once destined for the headless one" was supposed to mean, but the cookie itself wasn't very tasty.

PS, Todd, your wife sounds like my kinda gal.

I only do delivery in cases where I could, if I wanted, throw the cookies from my door and hit the recipient. 

Also, Scott, since you mentioned Holbo's blog. I'd really like to try hooking up Belle's sweet potato biscuits sometime soon. Perhaps, when I get around to that, I'll bean you with one.

My wife is an excellent kinda gal indeed, though in this case she would probably wish her excuse ("I assumed you'd already had some") to be known.

It is not worth mentioning at this juncture that on two separate occasions very recently I encountered a couple of people, literate and well informed, to whom the sentence "All your base are belong to us" meant nothing.
