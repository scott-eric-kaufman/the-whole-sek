[Bitch Ph.D.](http://bitchphd.blogspot.com/)--and before you say it, that's her name...there's no proof I'm a misogynist yet--sent readers scuttling over to Harvard's [Implicit Association Test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/).  I spent several uncoordinated minutes staring at
 

X after 

X after 

X after 

X 

only to learn that my incompetence suggested a slight automatic preference for White relative to Black.  The next test I took suggested a strong automatic preference for African American relative to White American.    

The only conclusion I can draw is that I have a slight disinclination to converse with a Black person until I'm 100%!c(MISSING)ertain he or she is an American, at which point the bonds of national identity shove aside whatever minute, unconscious reservations I had had.   Which means I'm not a racist...

...I'm a xenophobe.  All things considered, is there a better -ist to be in Southern California?

Well, I apparently have a strong preference for white people over black people, a strong association of women with family as opposed to career, a moderate association of men with the sciences as opposed to the liberal arts, and a moderate preference for gay people over straight people.

Basically, unless I've been a closet homosexual and raving bigot all my life, this test biases me toward whatever association it sets up between right and left in the first half. 

Can you tell that I'm stuck on my chapter?

Well, you /do/ dress pretty fine, Schryer. But I am inclined to fault the test. Say howdy to the little wife (I, too, associate women with domesticity)...

My little wife is significantly taller than me.
