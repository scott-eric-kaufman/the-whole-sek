## You've Been Had; or, Shoulders Shrugged, Underpants AWOL

A few months back, I entered my Amazon Associates ID into my Typepad profile thinking "Wouldn't it be nice to make enough in referral fees to pay for this blog?"  Seemed like an unobtrusive way—unlike the advertisements I can't seem to make disappear since I've upgraded my account to deal with the increased traffic from my courseblog—to bring in a couple extra dollars a month.  Turns out I hit on a variation of [the perfect business model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underpants\_Gnomes):

1.  Collect underpants.
2.  ???
3.  Profit!

The way Amazon Associates works is simple: if you click through to Amazon from Acephalous and place some junk in your shopping trunk, 4%!o(MISSING)f whatever you end up spending gets deposited in my now overflowing coffers.  Since that [Typepad Tip Jar](http://www.sixapart.com/typepad/news/2005/09/tips\_accepted\_h\_1.html) strikes me as crass capitalism, I want to float the following idea: if you're a loyal reader, appreciate what I write here _and are going to make a purchase through Amazon anyway_, why not click here first and help a starving grad. student starve a little less.  Granted, maybe "starve" is too strong a word . . . so how about "inebriated" instead?  (As in "Help an inebriated grad. student drink a little more?")  

Full disclosure: I only say this because there's something slimy about my having set this up and y'all "contributing" to the site without knowing it for the past few months.  I'm all about transparency and guilt.  Crippling guilt.

I'm confused: Does it _add_ four percent to the purchase price?  Or divert four percent from their 40-50%!m(MISSING)arkup?

If it is the second case, we should all take turns:  I'll buy through you, if you buy through me...  Find pajamas and Profit!

This seems like some sort of Ponzi scheme.

Also, if you can, [help Greg/Jon out.](http://lmergner.blogspot.com/2005/11/canon.html)

Luke, it doesn't add 4%!,(MISSING) it _distributes_ it to the purveyor of the site who "encouraged," via linkage, someone to purchase something from Amazon. In other words: you won't pay anymore . . . but I'll get a kickback.

It's most certainly a scheme, though not of the Ponzi variety, and we should definitely do it.  I don't know about you, but I order between $100 - $200 worth of books per month from Amazon, so this may be a way to 1) indulge in our vices and 2) get someone else to pay for them.

And once I've had a full night's sleep, I will come to Greg/Jon's aid.  (I'll admit the slash confuses me, but I'll still overwhelm him with a reading list . . . all items on which he should purchase through this site.)

This plan intrigues me since I as well spent several hundred dollars on Amazon every month or so -- at this point far exceeding my meager stipend.

On the slash, my theory was that I fear google therefore a pseudonym would make the blog more difficult for students and professors to find.  Once two out of three people had pseudonyms (myself and the silent William E. Gatsum) Greg decided abruptly to become Jonathan McGee for god knows what reasons.  Since I don't fear google reach into comments without the concatenation of name and surname, I don't feel the need to maintain his ridiculous charade.  Mystery solved.

The more I think about this, the more I like this idea.  But we should probably stop talking about it, lest it violate some policy.  But if anyone else wants in on "the action," chirp in.
