## An Unusual Footnote & A Few Words on Form

In the article [abstracted](http://acephalous.typepad.com/abstractalous/2006/06/hunger\_for\_the\_.html) this evening, I found the following footnote.  See, I'm a fan of footnotes.  I sometimes read them before the rest of an article in order to determine whether it's worth my time.  And I've read _a lot_ of them.  So imagine my surprise when I found this beauty at the tail end of the first:
Megan Glick’s undergraduate thesis, ‘‘‘Written by a Ghost of Their Time’: Locating the Civil War in Elizabeth Stoddards’s _The Morgesons_,’’ is one of the first works to notice the extent to which Stoddard borrows structures of thought from the commercial world to explain the domestic one; her analysis of _The Morgesons_ and Enlightenment definitions of contractual obligation intelligently observes the porous border between domesticity and law (Northwestern University, 2002). (726)

An _undergraduate thesis_ being cited in _American Literature_?  Amazing.  Were someone to cite mine, the shame would drive me underground.

On another note, tonight I wrote a far shorter, more _abstracty_ abstract.  I'm no more satisfied with it than I was with its overlong cousin–or with the fact that both fail to grab the general reader.  These two failures are not unrelated; both are the product of my poor form, and both will be rectified with a little practice.\*   

Also, I'm appending a few general notes to the end of each abstract.  Most of these will concern technique–from sentence-level wit to large argumentative structure–and are there because I belong to the writing-as-perpetual-apprenticeship school.  The only way to become a better writer is to imitate better writers, to work their prose over and under until you know it inside and out, and then to appropriate their techniques into your prose.

noted, a little practice can be a dangerous thing–but I don't think
that logic holds here.  (By "think" I obviously intend "hope.")

Why is it that English litcrit speak has become so enamored with metaphors of structure and geography?  

Does the commercial world really have "structures of thought"?  Sounds dubious.  Are there really borders between law and domesticity, and pourous ones at that?  Sounds like an incomprehensible metaphor.

Ugly, Scott. 

You understand, don't you, what sort of game this makes our writing into.

Blah, I think the whole "structuralism" and "poststructuralism" phases have a little to do with that.  That said, I think the "structure of feeling" bit comes from Raymond Williams, but I'm not sure there's a single genesis point for "structures of thought," outside the aforementioned affair with stucturalisms place and post-.  

CR, I don't see what you mean.  I think you can judge a lot about a scholar by his or her footnotes: thoroughness, for one; theoretical orientation, for another.  But more to the point, you can tell whether they argue with their source material or cite it authoritatively.  I can say, for example, that someone whose footnotes consist 90%!o(MISSING)f page references to Lacan will not be the sort of person who says something I think worth my time; whereas, to use a similar example, if someone's footnotes consist 90%!o(MISSING)f arguments with and/or about the application of Lacanian psychoanalysis to literary studies, I'm likely to respect this scholar and, quite possibly, find some of what he or she has to say useful, even if said scholar self-identifies as a Lacanian.  In short, then, you can demonstrate intellectual honesty in footnotes, and since we don't know long we have on this earth / until our advisors demand a draft, everyone must find some way to prioritize.  This just so happens to be mine.

Sorry I jumped. I must have been in a bad mood. Not sure if I'm in a better one because I stepped outside for a second and I think a bird shat on my head. Do birds fly at night? I doubt it was, like, an owl. Why don't I know this? I could have been a raindrop, but a really big and heavy raindrop. And there will be no shower tonite, as baby's asleep. Boo yah. 

Anywho. You're OK. But there are two ways that people use the phrase "reading for the footnotes." One is your way. But (and I'm sure you know this but for the benefit of our studio audience) there's also a practice of judging journal articles on the basis of footnotic proflicness. I should know. The piece I'm working on getting published came back last time from extremely prestigious / little read journal R with a reader's report that actually included a sentence that went something like, "Now I know it's going to look like I'm reading for the footnotes, but where is x, y, and z?" It wasn't that my reader was making a case that there was something wrong with my article, just that it didn't touch the customary bases. In fact, the verdict boiled down, for this reader: "Brilliantly done, but citationally deficient." Which is very frustrating. And lead me to revise the piece in the worst possible way: digging out the works of x, y, z, and maybe a,b, and c for good measure, and sprinkling the text with irrelevant footnotes and mini-paragraphs that start "There, of course, has been much scholarly debate on the subject. X famously said..." 

I think the article will get published now, in a slightly-less / actually read journal D, now that I've done the requisite name-dropping. But I really don't think my corrections have improved the piece. Certainly didn't add anything substantive to the argument. 

This is the second time this has happened to me. The first time was a revise and resubmit. They yelled at me, called me sloppy, told me to look at some critics, I cut and pasted, and they were fabulously happy with the new version. No substantive changes at all. Window-dressing. Strawmen. 

It's funny. I think you and I had two very different sets of advisors. When I would tell mine about this, they would say things like "fucking imbeciles! fuck them and their footnotes." Which, of course, explains the chip on my shoulder. Still, I wouldn't trade them for anything. Ultimately, this needs to be about something other than sub-discipinary circle jerking, ya know? 

Unfortunately, it's been beaten in to me enough that I've pavlovianly gotten the picture, and have a cite-cite-cite tic going on that's fucking up my writing now a tiny bit. Footnote fetishism, which I've never suffered from before.

That's pretty gross, CR. Is there some career point at which editors are allowed to assume that you know your field and you can focus on writing your piece without mashing  it up with an oral exam? Or is this just the way things stay when aiming at American academic journals? It's certainly a nasty habit to be forced into if you ever need to communicate with the outside world.

Ya know... I like footnotes/endnotes because I can find out ahead of time whether or not I want to read the article at all.  They tend to give you a good basis for the articles points and content.  Plus, you find gems like this:

\*As White Bear and N. Pepperell noted, a little practice can be a dangerous thing–but I don't think that logic holds here.

Eric, I take the opposite view.  "Practice does [indeed] make perfect," as I am always telling my lover(s):  Practice, Practice, Practice!
