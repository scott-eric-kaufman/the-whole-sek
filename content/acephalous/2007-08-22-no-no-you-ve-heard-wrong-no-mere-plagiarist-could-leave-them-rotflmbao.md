[Onika is the MAYOR OF SEXYTOWN](http://www.myspace.com/onikamichelle)!  She is [hilariously funny](http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=138423500&blogID=301819732&indicate=1) too![[\*]](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/onika-is-the-ma.html#1)  Reviews don't lie!  [nefarious jackson as stix (think sparkle)](http://www.myspace.com/beluvid) writes:

[Super Princess](http://www.myspace.com/misssales ) concurs:
This was wonderfully written and throughly entertaining but damn those
steps sound painfull as hell. There has to be a better way babygirl!
There has to be.

Ok but now that I know you are okay I am ROTFLMBAO!

[Kermit the Blog...formerly Big Perm](http://www.myspace.com/mamabigperm) loves the details Onika is the MAYOR OF SEXYTOWN! includes:
suet, ghee, tallow or smaltz...oh my goodness...you are so beautiful to me. I'm weak over here...and needed a laugh.

[HI, MY NAME IS MANNY MANN AND I'M A BLOGAHOLIC](http://www.myspace.com/mokpsion) loves the diagrams Onika is the MAYOR OF SEXYTOWN! uses and thinks she is "the bestest!":
You reading this to me was great, but it's even better with the diagrams, LOL.

My cheeks still ache from laughing.

Maybe I should've caught onto this bit of plagiarism because she linked to _my_ images in her post, but I don't check the site stats often enough.  

That said, I think I've found a brand new way to blog.  Below the fold, you'll find this thing I just now wrote like tonight.  It is so funny and I am so original!  Please find some way to give me kudos for my brilliantly hilarious post which I wrote myself because I am so original and funny!

[**MY** _AWESOME_ ANALYSIS OF SMACKING HAHAHA LOL!](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2005/11/analysis-of-smacking.html)

 In scholarly usage, things that
"smack" are always avoided, but they are avoided not in themselves, but
for the sake of that _of which_
they smack. In the formula "anything that smacks of X," the ultimate
object of avoidance is X; the "anything" is avoided insofar as it
participates in the essence of X. Not only is the smacker indifferent
("anything"), but the very nature of the smacking relationship is never
specified. Thus, for instance, to nearly any statement, one could
respond, "But my good sir, that smacks of fascism!" And indeed, to
state that something can be _smacked of_ instantly implies that
the smackee is something negative: one could imagine saying, with
whithering scorn, "That smacks of kittens and happiness," and
thereafter reenvisioning the normally well-regarded objects ("kittens
and happiness") as an insidious poison creeping through society. 

If one can envision the smackee as a normally positive object, however, one cannot maintain that, _qua_
smacked-of, it is desirable. It is linguistically impossible that one
would "embrace anything that smacked of X," even if, as in the above
example, X were "kittens and happiness." Or to use the fascism example,
one would not even be able to say that, for instance, "Hitler embraced
anything that smacked of fascism" (i.e., positing an embracer who would
regard as positive something that is generally regarded as negative). 

Smacking
casts a cloud of suspicion on the object X and on any indifferent
object that can be brought into any kind of relationship with it—if
we were to pursue a gustatory metaphor, one might liken the smacked-of
object to an appetizer, the taste of which one cannot get out of one's
mouth, such that it taints the rest of the meal. Perhaps, moving a step
further, one could say that those who wish to avoid smacked-of elements
lack a certain sophistication of pallet, and therefore that if Scholar
A characterizes Scholar B of "avoiding anything that smacks of X,"
Scholar A is attempting to claim that for Scholar B, everything tastes
like X—or, more broadly, that Scholar B's analysis smacks of
smacking. 

This is a highly effective rhetorical move: an
argument based on the guilt of association with guilt by association
arguments. (An indefinite regress is of course possible here.)

Wait...does this mean I can get away with "super-historicizing" all your posts in such a way as to make them \*about\* Aquinas? (Oh, it could be done...) You'll have to forgive the plagiarism, my dear; I've just been feeling too sexy for my cat as of late. 

I wonder if the [Geoffrey Chaucer](http://houseoffame.blogspot.com/) (who hath a blog) does head-notes-for-pay?

I can decode all the letters of the ROTFLMBAO acronym except the B.  Is it 'big'?  'black'? 'button-cute'?  Maybe it's 'bitten-by-the-plagiary-bug'.  But, no, that would be ROTFLMBBTPBAO, which would just be silly.

Someone has a point, SEK. Fucking racist. Not quite as racist as "you dont sound black," but maybe if you try harder next time. 

Also, re: "how do we no she didnt write it 1st and u stole it?" While I'm not sure that we can ever really "no" anything with certainty, one wonders how Onika would have managed to link to images on Scott's site before he got around to plagiarizing her post. Clearly Onika is more clever "then" we had guessed!

_onikas much more original then antyhing on ur shit site._ 

I would accept no less of the MAYOR OF SEXYTOWN.

_how do we no she didnt write it 1st and u stole it?_

Unless the MAYOR OF SEXYTOWN has a time machine, I'm pretty sure dates will suffice.

_and you dont sound black so sayin ur ROTFLMBAO is fucking racist._

Because I'm unfamiliar with your idiotic acronyms, I'm _racist_?  Well, TTUPYUONPARYUENET.  And don't you _dare_ come back with that IKJUTIFJAK shit.  I won't stand for it.  

(And wait, if she stole it from me and I don't sound black, why did you even think she wrote it in the first place?  Or is "sound black" code for "whatever a black person says"?  Wait, no, that would make no sense, since black people don't all sound alike.  I'm very confused, anon.  Educate me.)

Crossed in the ether, todd.  Yes, her linking to my pictures makes it even _more_ unlikely that she wrote it first.  Unless, fuck, do they give the MAYOR OF SEXYTOWN! the keys to the internet?  Could she have put those pictures on my internets and then linked to them?  Shit, how powerful is she?

Isn't there some rule about a copyrights,trademarks, etc. becoming invalid if you don't attempt to enforce them?  What's the point of your creative commons if you don't atleast complain?  Come on now!  FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!  I want to see some blood.  Kick them while they're down!
