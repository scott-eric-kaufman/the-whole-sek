If ever a photo called out for a caption, this one does.

**UPDATE:** It'Â™s a little long for a caption, but I do believe [AWB](http://istherenosininit.wordpress.com/)[]()[allegorizes the moment to perfection](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/the-enduring-image-of-the-2008-presidential-campaign/#comment-23608):

The whole situation is emblematic of his campaign. He's
smug and overconfident sitting on his side of the desk, but Obama makes
a move to the left and he unconsciously follows it, until he realizes
it makes him look like a follower, at which point he does something
hideous and shocking before heading as far to the right as possible.
