## How to Be a Blogger and Write Blogs People Love Reading When They Read Blogs (Which is Often)

I 
keep 
reading [things](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/10/22/webheadlines-benefit.html) about how to 
BLOG 
best but it seems to me that 
SOME PEOPLE 
are ignorant about how to 
BLOG 
"well" much less "best."  For 
EXAMPLE 
no one ever writes about the 
ADVANTAGES OF MAKING 

YOUR BLOG 

LOOK LIKE 

IT WAS (and 

IS

) 
the product of an unhinged mind.

Do 
PEOPLE 
not recognize the 
ADVANTAGES 
of
Random 
blockquoting 
or 

*   Un
NECESSARY 
bullets

1.  and "
outlines
" that would shock 
YOUR 
high school English teacher?

THEY 

do not.  

They 

THINK 
this sort of formating 
ENHANCES 
their arguments.  It 
DOES 

not.

I call it: "Frustration Blogged as Performance Art."

The miniscule type on the final "not" is a lovely touch, too. Just a soupcon of ambiguity to rev up the commenters....

I'm not sure whether to feel robbed-by or blessed-for RSS aggregators which ignore formatting instructions.

Oh, I see. You did the cover of that OJ book "small(if) I did it." Good work. Hope you got paid.

Google Reader kept the font sizes, but missed out on the nifty overlapping effect that makes it look like half the words are marching off the screen towards you. Like the blink command, only without the seizures!

Sadly,  Doctorow's sparingly formatted excerpt is more readable than the original.

And um, isn't his headline in the active voice?

The University of California Library System is a member in good standing of the Association of American Libraries and Secret Criminal Societies. We run numbers, prostitution and complex overdue book scams. 

One of our big new rackets involves unusual typography. We "loan" out James Joyce and similar volumes in disorienting typesets which cannot possibly be read by the due date. Then we "collect" our book and a little "interest." You know, just enough to get our beak wet.  

P.S., Scott, The Library System has a policy of property ownership not exactly unlike that of a toddler. If we have it, it is ours. If we see it, it is ours. If it is yours, it is ours. 

P.P.S. You can find an AALSCS-approved video version of disorienting typography [right meow.](http://youtube.com/watch?v=U41v7jgzbTk) Just don't try to horn in on our racket. Capish?

scott,

sorry i never got back to your first email..as is apt to happen when things get critical, my computer died.

in any case, glad to see you're back around campus here and there.  sucks about the payment situation though.  

sparked up an interesting conversation with some lj101 classmates, and they said that you had gotten hit by a car?  wth dude!

well, if you're on campus any time during the week, i'd love to drop by and say wat's up.

later.
