## A Message to the Paris Hilton Community

I knew this time would come, but now that it has, I'm sad.  So burdened am I with the burdens of this burdensome life, I'm left with no choice but to unburden myself by acquiring [an unhealthy obsession](http://mthollywood.blogspot.com/) with the lives of other people.  

I'm undecided as to what I'll spend the rest of my tedious life tediously writing about, but I hear good things about the Paris Hilton community.  That could work.  I could spend all my time reading about the Paris Hilton community, then I could write all about how the Paris Hilton community doesn't understand what the__Paris Hilton community _really_ wants to know.  I could repeatedly tell the Paris Hilton community how debilitating its obsession with Paris Hilton is and how it should be spending its time obsessing over something more interesting, something more worthwhile, you know, like the Paris Hilton community.  Then I could spend hours wondering why so many members of the Paris Hilton community spend hours reading about Paris Hilton instead of flocking to www.what-i-think-is-wrong-with-the-paris-hilton-community.com and reading my chronicle of their shortcomings.  

That.  Would.  Be.  Awesome.
