**ME**: Do do do do WHOA!

 

 **HALF-NAKED COUPLE IN MY OFFICE**: GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!

 

 **ME**: What?

 

 **HALF-NAKED FEMALE**: DON'T YOU KNOCK? (
putting shirt back on
)

 

 **ME**: Before I come into my office?

 

 **HALF-NAKED MALE**: GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE! (
buttoning pants
)

 

 **ME**: (
starting to enjoy this
) I have a student coming in two minutes.  Finish up.

 

 **HALF-NAKED, BLUE-BALLED MALE**: GO ALREADY!

 

 **ME**: (
closes door, waits one minute, knocks
) Are you decent?

 

 **HALF-NAKED MALE**: GO THE FUCK AWAY!  THIS IS PRIVATE!  WE'RE BUSY!

 

 **ME**: (
holding the door half-open
) I'm coming in.

 

 **HALF-NAKED MALE**: STOP HARASSING US YOU PERVERT OR I'LL REPORT YOU!

 

 **ME**: (
still holding door
) You'll report _me_ for _your_ having sex in _my_ office?

 

 **HALF-NAKED MALE**: GO THE FUCK AWAY!

 

 **ME**: (
still holding door
) That's it.  Put your clothes back on.  You can't have sex in my office.

 

 **HALF-NAKED MALE**: DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE COME IN HERE! 

(
my student walks up
)

 

 **MY STUDENT**: What's going on?

 

 **ME**: (_still holding door_) Some people are trying to have sex in my office.  I keep interrupting them.

 

 **MY STUDENT**: Are they really having sex in there?

 

 **HALF-NAKED MALE**: THIS IS SEXUAL HARASSMENT!

 

 **ME**: (
props open door with rubber stop
) They're trying.

Reposted because, well, because all the updates are depressing, and this is damn funny.  (Plus, you can't count on people to read your archives, and who knows, maybe one or two of you came here for the smart-talk without realizing what I'm forever going to be known for.)

You, being as you are a Tom Waits fan, are undoubtedly familiar with the excellent performance of "Burma Shave", bookended by bits of "Summertime", from the bootleg _Cold Beer on a Hot Night_.

Someone should make Burma Shave t-shirts.  A rhyme down the front, and on the back, "Burma Shave".

RE: #2

Yes, they should.

RE: #1

Actually, I don't have that.  We should form an illegal enterprise dedicated to the trading of such rarities.

A full-fledged enterprise will probably be [unnecessary](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~wolfson/summertime.mp3).
