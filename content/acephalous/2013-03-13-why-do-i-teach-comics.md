## Why do I teach comics?

I don’t know, [why don’t you just ask me](http://blogs.bedfordstmartins.com/bits/jonathan-alexander/the-recursive-modes-of-comics-a-dialogue-with-two-writing-teachers/loshalex/)? Because apparently

I  fool [students] into acquiring a decent approximation 
of expertise by  providing them with source material that they believe 
they can become  expert in. They’ll happily read eight chapters from _Understanding Comics_
 and memorize the 70 odd bits of critical vocabulary contained therein, 
 whereas if I asked them to do something similar with Ciceronian 
rhetoric  their anxiety would preclude the possibility of them ever 
feeling like  they could master the material.

Or so I say!

I take it most of you are already familiar with my work on the 
medium, but for those who aren’t, I’ll throw some links below the fold.
