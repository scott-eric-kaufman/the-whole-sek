## I've run away to England, I have.

I apologize for not writing more, but I've been out and about in beautiful England:

That's a photograph I took this morning, and as you can see, the evidence that I'm in the midst of an impending apocalypse is a little thin on the ground. That's the grand irony of Eyjafjallajoekull's wrath: it has turned England into Southern California, which annoys me immensely, as I came here with the expectation of weather—brought an umbrella and everything—but here I am sitting in 72 degree weather with neither a cloud nor contrail in the sky. It's a beautiful day, and the natives are right to be enthused, but you can understand my disappointment.  

This apocalypse simply doesn't feel very apocalyptic, which is itself ironic, given that when I was visiting Adam Roberts the other day I argued that Updike's _[Toward the End of Time](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0449000419/diesekoschmar-20)_ failed as a novel because its post-apocalyptic narratives were pre-apocalyptically mundane. My argument can be condensed into a sentence: the trope of 9/10-type thought is effective because America reinvented itself as a police state the next day.  That's what that apocalypse wrought. When something this large happens, life doesn't simply continue as if nothing happened _except in this case_.  

Finally, to allay some of the concerns I've received via email: I'm safe and secure and not emptying my savings into some hotel chain's coffers. I'm staying with a friend and will be until Iceland ceases its offensive against the good people of Europe.

Isn't "Mundane" Updike's middle name?

It is, which is why the thought of him writing a post-apocalyptic science fiction novel.  Adam actually won that argument, and convinced me that book might be worth revisiting someday.

_I'm safe and secure_ 

or until your friend eats you. I believe this is called "mash and bangers"

Do you have teaching duties at the moment? I'm assuming not, or else you've attained a level of Zen detachment well beyond my ken.

_Do you have teaching duties at the moment?_

I do, actually.  Fortunately, my boss's boss is my co-author, and she's stuck over with me; that, and, it's not like anyone can claim I making this up.  I went to Europe, blew up Iceland, etc. etc. etc.

The class thing is a little distressing, though, but I did teach this very course over the summer last year, so it's not insurmountable.  I'm actually, this very moment, in the process of putting together an online lesson plan for this week.  (I'm currently scheduled to depart on Sunday, now, which is only a week after I'd planned.  Gah.)

"_Adam actually won that argument_."  Wait ... I did?

Is that why you left a pair of boxers on the radiator? My winnings? In that case I shall treasure them.

I don't think for reals America reinvented itself as a police state. Police states put up walls. We commissioned a pilot test of magic Boeing poles.

Not same same I don't think.

Well, except the people who want to go all Israel on Mexico took the opportunity to fund-raise for their dream of a big ol' fence along the Rio Grande.

Of course, then most of the money went into someone's pockets....

Hey, I am wondering when you are really coming home. Is your boss staying in a hotel or with other friends? Dad and I watched a funny show last night.  They talked about "Free Time" in marriage.  Like having a girls night out while you stay home and do whatever you like.  The funny part was the "I will really, really miss you". Now you know how it is for us when Dad travels, he is now in Torrance and will check Meg at some point during the week.  For now just see as much as you can there and look at the adventure you are having.  Also, tell you host thank you each and every day and let them know they are welcome to visit Houston any time. I was wondering when you were going to take your class online. It is a way for them to not fall far behind since they have only 10 weeks with you - great idea!
