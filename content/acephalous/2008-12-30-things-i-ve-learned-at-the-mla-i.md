1.  The most cogent justification of the discipline to those outside the discipline is pedagogical.
2.  Easily transmissable forms of inquiry should be the foundation both of undergraduate teaching and graduate professionalization.
3.  Charismatic arguments are compelling because they are reproducible.
4.  All compelling arguments are not charismatic.  ("No school of Fish.")
5.  Time robs Peters ("the moment of Theory has passed") to pay Pauls  ("the moment of Theory has passed, but Agamben is damn charismatic").
6.  Doctoral institutions should require all graduate students to publish four articles before awarding them a Ph.D.
7.  Similarly: Ph.D. candidates should submit required coursework by the third week of graduate seminars.
8.  A conference in which participants only present what's "in the longer version of this paper" is a fantastic idea.
9.  The most efficient way to test the mettle of a candidate who has written seven books is a twenty-minute Q&A session before a potentially hostile audience.
10.  Adorno said that? 
11.  Theory allows people to adopt a quick, quasi-sophisticated detachment from texts.
12.  What quick, quasi-sophisticated students of Theory thought about texts last week is perpetually naive and stupid.
13.  These thoughts are naive and stupid because they address a) the surface of the text before discovering what was beneath it, b) the new surface of the text discovered beneath the former, then c) discovering the new surface is no further beneath anything than the former, necessitating the discovery of another new surface beneath the formerly new one ...
14.  Even when presenters insist there are no necessary connections between the panelists presentations, some people insist on finding them anyway.

Boy, 6 and 7 make me glad I got out with my PhD before all those regulations got instituted. 

You forgot to add that no matter what you do about the job market there will be people reaming you for your choices. (waves) Hi! Have fun!

Pedagogy? Well, duh. Teaching is productive labor, but publishing is only capital investment, which in turns increases the (future) value of your labor.
