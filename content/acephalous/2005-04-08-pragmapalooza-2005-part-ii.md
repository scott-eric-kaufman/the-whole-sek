Never verified whether Rorty remembered our brief encounter in LSU's dining hall circa 1997, but I did attend the lecture, during which he connected the project of pragmatism to Hegelianism and Romantic self-creation...

...I'll add a "highlight" reel sometime later tonight, but for now, I would like it to be known that I 

1.  called Rorty's characterization of the relationship between analytic philosophers interested in language and cognitive scientists as "disingenuous" during the Q & A and
2.  asked the question I wanted to ask. 

How do I know I asked the question I wanted to ask?  The first two words of his response: "Since Darwin..."  If only the rest of his response had been so substantial.

OK, I was also at LSU in 1997, and reading Rorty for a phil. class. I don't recall him ever coming to LSU...
