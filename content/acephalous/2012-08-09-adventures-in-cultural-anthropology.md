_SEK [is always to be having fun in a supermarkets](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/01/time-to-mock-el.html). Today he is standing in the checkout line. In front of him is a very large, very genial black WOMAN unloading eighteen loaves of white bread and half a dozen cases of Coke onto the conveyor belt._

**WOMAN:** (_singing under her breath_) [Breakdown, uh takedown, shakedown, everybody wants into uh crowded line](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1il68Opxug) ...

_SEK looks at her perplexedly. She removes yet another case of Coke from her clown car of a shopping cart and places it on the conveyor belt._ 

**WOMAN:** (_still singing under her breath_) [Breakdown, uh takedown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1il68Opxug) ...__

_SEK looks at her. She looks at SEK._

**WOMAN:** (_like she's Praising The Lord_) [YOU BUSTED](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1il68Opxug)!__

_EVERYONE ELSE IN THE STORE turns to see who's been busted doing what. SEK would say something but he's trying too hard not to laugh._

**WOMAN:** Well, you is. (_her hands become little pistols miming Bang Bang Bang as she belts out_) [YOU BUSTED](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1il68Opxug)! __

SEK does not exist and these things do not happen to him. Wake up, sheeple!
