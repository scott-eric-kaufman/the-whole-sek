Say beertender, I'll have what Scott's having. Just without the scary hallucinations, OK? Because I already did my "hit by a car" bit about 30 years ago. Dang, I'm getting old. 

Thanks. A good old German dark beer, please. Yeah, I'll include it in my carb count. 

Good explanation for what happened though. But what if you don't have a blog?

Heh... this is what happens when I read your blog, DH. I am now seeing little animated Twiggies (Twiggy-ies?) running across my wrapping-paper mappamundi...

Sorry about that.  I decided to clean out my "Junk Mail" folder today and found about seventeen chain letters in there, all of which are represented, in part, above.  I just thought I'd punch 'em up a bit with some ambiguous interlacing which calls into question whether the chain-letter-writers are Really _Really_ dead or a dysfunctional scam family preying on the innocent while remaining, well, conventionally dysfunctional.  

P.S. David, that'd be a vodka tonic on the rocks.

That's good. Or a Vodka Collins, but those things are too sweet for me any more.

don't forget the lime in the vodka tonic.   **I SAID**   _LIME_  NOT TWIST!!  SHIT!  BITCH.  AND IF, IF I FIND ONE FUCKING SEED FLOATING IN MY CUP...   If you don't tip your bartender the one you love will tell you you're an ugly cow and you will die an old maid.  of the cow.  that you are.

seeds floating in my drink would be the end of that night for I saw what happened to my friend when she was suprised by a seed in her drink. This one night my friend, who is a functioning alcoholic, go out and she orders her drink, as well, a vodic tonic and ends up choking on a seed while we are talking to a group of guys at the bar. This is the girl I love to go out with because she is gorgeous and we always meet tons of guys when we go out together and she ends up choking with her drink spilling out of her mouth, her face turning red, and then a seed spitting out of her mouth. HORRIBLE experience and now her drink is no longer the amazing vodic tonic.

My sweetie sent me a link to this post when it was first posted but that was while nursing school was still in session so I didn't read it until today and...

Damn, that chain-letter-writing syntax is infectious!

For some reason, I find the continued commenting on this post extremely gratifying.  Everyone should regularly comment on things buried deep in my archives.  (_Especially_ if said comments are as juvenile as the mindset I mocked in the post.)
