## Deem creep!

The noise from the right about the constitutionality of “deeming” 
beggars description. Consider [Limbaugh](http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_031710/content/01125108.guest.html):

> If [House Democrats] pass this using the Slaughter solution—in other words, literally shredding the Constitution.

I decline to comment on his claim that passing this bill by “deeming” it passed will _literally_ cause someone to walk into the National Archives and ribbon the Constitution, because the point of Limbaugh’s literal metaphor is plain enough: if the majority of the House votes to “deem” the Senate version of the bill passed, Democrats would have skirted the Constitutional requirement that, to [become a law](http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst\_A1Sec7.html), a bill must “have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate” as “determined by Yeas and Nays,” _i.e._ a simple majority.

How would the Democrats have accomplished this dastardly unconstitutional deed?

By a House vote on November 7, 2009, in which 220 Yeas passed H.R. 3962 over the objection of 215 Nays, followed by a Senate vote on December 24, 2009, in which 60 Yeas passed H.R.  3590 over the objection of 39 Nays. These votes were both constitutionally kosher; however, the House now plans to undermine democracy by “deeming” H.R. 3590 passed not by a floor vote “determined by Yeas and Nays,” but _by a floor vote “determined by Yeas and Nays.”_

The Democrats expect the American people to accept the unconstitutional results of a House vote in which members of the House vote to determine whether a bill should or should not be passed. The Democrats are determining the Rules of House proceedings, a practice the Constitution [explicitly outlaws](http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec5.html), in Article 1, Section 5: “Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings.”

I understand why conservatives are outraged: In order to defeat a parliamentary procedure not mentioned in the Constitution—the threatened Senate filibuster—House Democrats are exercising a right granted to them by the Constitution—the right to self-determine the Rules of their Proceedings—by voting in the manner the Constitution demands—a simple majority. Moreover, they’re doing so without passing the bill, because even if more representatives vote to “deem” H.R. 3590 passed, that merely means that a simple majority voted “Yea” on the question of whether H.R. 3590 should be passed. A vote to pass H.R. 3590 is, as all [loyal Americans](http://michellemalkin.com/2010/03/16/house-republicans-to-force-vote-on-pelosis-slaughter-house-solution/) know, not the same thing as a vote in favor of a bill that “ensur[es] an up or down vote” to pass H.R. 3590. Why?

Because bypassing a direct vote on the bill allows _Democrats_ to convince _other Democrats_ to vote for health care reform now _and_ claim a little distance from it in the midterm elections.  Why do House Democrats need that distance? Because they know that Republicans are chomping at the bit to attack any and everyone who votes for health care reform, and they know that the tactics the Republicans will use will be dishonest. In the final tally, then: because they know that the next election will be all about death panels and the coming socialism, and because they know that Senate Republicans are determined to filibuster or bust, House Democrats decided to fight an extra-constitutional parliamentary procedure by exercising a right explicitly granted to them by the Constitution. How is this unconstitutional?

I’m being serious here: _How is this unconstitutional_?

Is it petty parliamentary gamesmanship? Without a doubt.

Does it make the Democrats who proscribed this practice in the past look like hypocrites? No more so, any objective observer would argue, than their Republican counterparts whose past use of this practice led the Democrats to condemn it.

Is a vote on a point of order that requires a two-third majority inherently more democratic than a vote on a point of order that requires a simple one? I’ll let you be the judge.

The point is, this is a procedural detour designed to avoid procedural congestion on a stretch of legislative territory as flat as a Texas highway. _There is no moral high ground here_. Anyone who claims otherwise believes that if they shout loud enough, people will mistake them for tall.

The real story here isn't about how crazy and evil these people are, there've been people like that all along, but how much they are enabled by major institutions and how little they are resisted. The public discourseis really poisoned. It's a lot more like Czarist Russia or.... some other very bad regime than we've been willing to admit.

Republicans used the "deeming" procedure 35 times when they were in power ... no, why bother.  What really tires me out about these posts is how strenuously you argue against whatever nonsense you're writing about.  Look, you say, I will painstakingly trace back through the process and show that it is constitutional at every stage!  It's like a rigorous, logical proof, following from simple first principles, that a shit-throwing monkey should not in fact throw shit at people.

Berube used to say that mockery was the best answer, because argument only made it seem as if they were worth arguing against.  Or something like that; I'm sure that he put it better.  But mockery no longer works, at least for me, because you can't mock a monkey.  These people no longer have any power, except what we choose to give them.  And since by "we" I mean "the elected Democratic leadership", it's not something "we" meaning "people who read this blog" can do anything about.  But insofar as we can do anything, they are the people who need to be argued against.  How dare Obama waste every chance we've given him?  "The public discourse" only matters insofar as weak leaders listen to it.

Rich, I'm one of those people who's always argued for civility and reason, but I'm starting to crack. I blame [Sarah Palin](http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com/2010/03/comment-elsewhere-fighting-fire-with.html): If we can't get the press to stop enabling these bad actors, then we need to make the press feel foolish for being associated with them.

Is a vote on a point of order that requires a two-third majority inherently more democratic than a vote on a point of order that requires a simple one? I’ll let you be the judge.

Why no, it's not.  But that's rather the point.

In the course of a longer discussion about [the importance of a unitary executive](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa70.htm), Publius writes (and I'm going to give a long quote so you can get the context),

Wherever two or more persons are engaged in any common enterprise or pursuit, there is always danger of difference of opinion. If it be a public trust or office, in which they are clothed with equal dignity and authority, there is peculiar danger of personal emulation and even animosity. From either, and especially from all these causes, the most bitter dissensions are apt to spring. Whenever these happen, they lessen the respectability, weaken the authority, and distract the plans and operation of those whom they divide. If they should unfortunately assail the supreme executive magistracy of a country, consisting of a plurality of persons, they might impede or frustrate the most important measures of the government, in the most critical emergencies of the state. And what is still worse, they might split the community into the most violent and irreconcilable factions, adhering differently to the different individuals who composed the magistracy.

Men often oppose a thing, merely because they have had no agency in planning it, or because it may have been planned by those whom they dislike. But if they have been consulted, and have happened to disapprove, opposition then becomes, in their estimation, an indispensable duty of self-love. They seem to think themselves bound in honor, and by all the motives of personal infallibility, to defeat the success of what has been resolved upon contrary to their sentiments. Men of upright, benevolent tempers have too many opportunities of remarking, with horror, to what desperate lengths this disposition is sometimes carried, and how often the great interests of society are sacrificed to the vanity, to the conceit, and to the obstinacy of individuals, who have credit enough to make their passions and their caprices interesting to mankind. Perhaps the question now before the public may, in its consequences, afford melancholy proofs of the effects of this despicable frailty, or rather detestable vice, in the human character.

**Upon the principles of a free government, inconveniences from the source just mentioned must necessarily be submitted to in the formation of the legislature**; but it is unnecessary, and therefore unwise, to introduce them into the constitution of the Executive. It is here too that they may be most pernicious. **In the legislature, promptitude of decision is oftener an evil than a benefit. The differences of opinion, and the jarrings of parties in that department of the government, though they may sometimes obstruct salutary plans, yet often promote deliberation and circumspection, and serve to check excesses in the majority.** When a resolution too is once taken, the opposition must be at an end. That resolution is a law, and resistance to it punishable. But no favorable circumstances palliate or atone for the disadvantages of dissension in the executive department. Here, they are pure and unmixed. There is no point at which they cease to operate. They serve to embarrass and weaken the execution of the plan or measure to which they relate, from the first step to the final conclusion of it. They constantly counteract those qualities in the Executive which are the most necessary ingredients in its composition -- vigor and expedition, and this without any counterbalancing good. In the conduct of war, in which the energy of the Executive is the bulwark of the national security, every thing would be to be apprehended from its plurality.

In any case, the filibuster at least requires that the party using it take responsibility for their actions.  This deem and pass, as you've said, allows our representatives to avoid their responsibility.

Why do house democrats need that cover?  

Because they know that what the WH is calling "health care reform" is wildly unpopular in many districts. Representatives should have to take a yea or nay stand to prevent the flood of weasel-words that will naturally follow the deeming process.

Actually, "dad," the cover is as much for Dems from progressive districts who swore that they wouldn't vote for a bill that didn't have a public option, which seems to be what we're stuck with at this point.

"Deemed passed" is indeed silly, and I'm not sure how it could possibly shift the debate in particular campaigns (either you voted for something or you didn't), but it doesn't erase responsibility.  Conservative arguments that dems are ramming through unpopular legislation are either wholly disingenuous or based on conflating opposition from those who think that there should be no bill and those who think this bill doesn't go nearly far enough.

Fritz, that's some fancy block quoting, but come on.  Republicans chose not to have anything to do with crafting the bill because they decided that it was more important to prevent Obama and the dems from passing anything on the grounds that this would symbolize some greater political defeat. Plus, they have hung their hat on stirring up opposition to health care reform of any kind besed on hatred of the "unworthy poor."
