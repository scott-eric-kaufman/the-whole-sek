Until I thought about what it looks like in their heads:

[![hugochavezgoogle](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/hugochavezgoogle-1024x442.jpg "hugochavezgoogle")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/hugochavezgoogle.jpg)

I'd be upset too if I expected something Christian [like Easter eggs](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/03/31/cesar\_chavez\_google\_doodle\_vs\_bing\_easter\_eggs.html) and saw _that_ instead.

**UPDATE:** Turns out my sarcasm was prescient. [Team Malkin for the win](http://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/people-who-think-google-is-honoring-hugo-chavez)! [Winners abound](http://publicshaming.tumblr.com/day/2013/03/31)!

**UPDATE II:** And of course, [a] Glenn Reynolds [clone posting at Glenn Reynolds' site] [can't help but add](http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/166225/): "[Twitchy.com](http://twitchy.com/2013/03/31/google-celebrates-easter-with-cesar-chavez-birthday-tribute/) notes that 'Google’s Easter insult [sparks Twitter backlash, mockery,'](http://twitchy.com/2013/03/31/googlemottos-googles-easter-insult-sparks-twitter-backlash-mockery/)
 as well it should." It's almost as if he doesn't know that the entire 
point of Twitchy.com is to manufacture and amplify "grassroots" "Twitter
 backlash." (Or like it's in his best interest to pretend not to be a party to the scam.)

**UPDATE III:** When I added the words "Glenn Reynolds" to this post, Typepad's "Related Posts" recommendations changed to:

I'm not saying nothing about anything. I'm just saying.
