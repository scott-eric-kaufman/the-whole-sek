Because I had a conversation with a number of people about my last visual rhetoric course during orientation today, I'm going to post my link-happy summary of it from last fall again (with a couple of notable additions):

1.   I introduce them to the idea of [the overdetermined image](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/teaching-the-overdetermined-image-.html), because nothing is accidental in an Alan Moore script.2.  Nor, for that matter, is anything accidental when it costs $80,000  per second to film it, which is why we then discuss how Christopher  Nolan turns Batman into [classic horror monster](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/batman-begins-works-because-christopher-nolan-decided-to-spend-the-first-hour-and-twenty-minutes-denying-the-audience-what-it.html) in _Batman Begins_.  The point here is get them fluent in the language of film, so that they  might make arguments about how directors manipulate the camera in order  to appeal to the audience. (We also discuss what is and isn't in the  diegetic space, _e.g._ music, which is heard by the audience but not the characters.)3.  Then it's [on to _The Dark Knight_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/dark-knight-scene-analysis.html). That link goes to a reading of the interrogation scene; [this one](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/little-bit-more-on-teaching-the-dark-knight.html) leads you to a similarly thorough analysis dedicated to proving the  controversial thesis that Batman is really fast—because demonstrating  that even the simplest of claims require evidence and careful argument  to be taken seriously is the point of the course.4.  Now that they're relatively fluent in the language of film, we try to prove something a little more complex; namely, that _Superman Returns_ is very much about 9/11. First, I take them back to [September morning](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/prelude-to-a-scene-analysis-of-bryan-singers-superman-returns.html); then we [analyze the action sequence that's about planes slamming into NYC landmarks](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/superman-returns-.html), lest they think I'm reading too much into the anxieties the film taps into.
5.  Now that they're comfortable with film, I get them to apply that  knowledge to comics via the comic that's about the conventions of comics  and is therefore utterly unfilmable, _Watchmen_. I begin by reminding them of the overdetermined nature of the image, then we discuss [panel transitions and word-picture relation](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/like-what-i-did-with-the-dark-knight-only-this-time-about-the-fourth-issue-of-watchmenin-making-comics-scott-mccloud-argue.html), move on [layout and narrative flow](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/more-on-watchmen-dave-gibbons-layout-and-john-higgins-ink-in-the-age-of-mechanical-reproduction.html), then I try [to prove what I stated in the second sentence about _Watchmen_ being a meta-comic](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/03/dr-manhattan-as-a-figure-of-reader-of-alan-moores-watchmen.html).  My argument's deliberately argumentative, because Dr. Manhattan can  also function as a figure of the reader as well the author, but that's  an argument I want to have. From there, it's onto [the unfilmable film itself](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/03/watchmen-and-the-scene-of-reading-being-a-response-to-anthony-lanes-review-of-zak-snyders-adaptation.html#more).6.  Now that they can break film _and_ comics into their  constituent parts, I re-orient them in an explicitly rhetorical  direction. We talk about the rhetorical situation, which is, of course, [a triangle](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/03/more-for-voyeurs-on-panel-transitions-and-narrative-speed.html).  (For the record: that silliness is me teaching myself to manipulate  images in Photoshop for my book on teaching visual rhetoric.) Then we  situate the rhetorical context [in the historical context via Warren Ellis's _Planetary/Batman: Night on Earth_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/teaching-rhetoric-via-warren-ellis-planetary-batman-night-on-earth.html).7.  [I call them all murderers](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/10/on-informing-your-students-that-theyre-murderers.html) for the violence they perpetrate in the gutters.
8.  From there on out, it's all about the writing.  I teach them about [paragraph burgers](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/05/how-to-structure-a-paragraph-with-a-hamburger.html),  which, while silly, is the single most effective means I've found to  teach paragraph structure. Students intuitively understand that you  don't call a pickle with and a piece of a cheese a "hamburger." For the  remainder of the quarter, we use the tools from the beginning of the  course to make sophisticated arguments about the rhetorical stakes of  what they'd otherwise dismiss as pop culture ephemera.9.  Finally, here is a link to a [descriptive list](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/12/an-end-of-the-quarter-treat-batman-is-my-boss.html) of some of my more successful Rhetoric in Practive projects.
