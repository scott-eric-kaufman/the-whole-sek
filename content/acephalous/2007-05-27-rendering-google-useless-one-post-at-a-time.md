## Rendering Google Useless, One Post at a Time

So I'm desperately trying to remember the title of the influential late-nineteenth century book arguing that evolutionary theory favors socialist (or socialistic) cooperatives.  After fruitlessly scanning my bookshelves and skimming my notes, I decide to put the matter to Google.  

"'[Evolutionary theory socialism](http://www.google.com/search?q=evolutionary+theory+socialism)' should cover it," I think to myself.  

Wrong.

(I'm consoled by the fact that this post served its purpose.  By distracting myself with its composition, I allowed the answer—Pyotr Kropotkin's [_Mutual Aid_](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4341) (1902)—to bubble up from the depths.)

Pretty funny.  I'd wager that within six months, the search will give results different enough to render this post completely incomprehensible.

Weird, I haven't looked at this blog in months until today and it turns out it is asking a question that I not only know the answer to, but I have the book right here, in my box of political-theory-that-impressed-me-as-an-undergraduate books.  Too bad your memory beat me out of being useful. You know, I suppose, that this is a perenniel ongoing debate in evolutionary theory (google "group selection")?

Haven't been here in months!?!  Why would you stay away?  Since you've been gone, Scott's discovered an orgy in his office, fought off seven grues, and written eleven of the funniest things I've ever read!  Where have you been, that you haven't been here!?!

P.S.  Scott, if you're reading this, remember that B you gave me?  Maybe you can kick it up a bit?  I'm applying to grad school in the Fall.  No pressure, dude.

At least for those who have a Google account, which includes everybody on Blogspot, Google now personalizes the results of searches based on your past searches, which means that your post is already incomprehensible to a lot of people, including me at first. For instance, I found [this post](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary\_theory\_and\_the\_political\_left), which would have answered your question, on my second page of results. From the title of this post, I'm guessing that you only got posts you'd written yourself, but I only got one post of yours on the first two pages (in fact, this very post).

Vance, I have my doubts.  The dynamic nature of my "evolutionary theory socialism" content should guarantee me a place of pride on that search for some time.  

Justin, no virtual grade-grubbing!  (Esp. not three years after the fact.  That said, I'd be more than happy to write you a letter of recommendation, if you'd like.)

Adam, that's odd.  I think it means I Google my own site too much -- not out of vanity, but because it's something of a scratch-pad for my very serious, [Scottfordshire](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/the\_pros\_and\_co.html#comment-70931552) work.  Still, I would think [the post which shows up first](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/08/socialism\_evolu.html) on my search would show up someone in yours.

You're right: that is my top post, not this one. At least it is today, and I presume it was the same yesterday. I was half-asleep yesterday, which may explain my error. (This post shows up today as result number 51.)
