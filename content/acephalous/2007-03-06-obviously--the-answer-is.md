...they're _all_ Cylons, and have been for so long they no longer remember the death of the last human.  

Wait, is this thing on?  _

_Tap tap tap._  

Is this recording?  _  
_

_Check, check one, check two._  

What does this light mean?  

Hold on a minute.  I sat down and had a thought.  

Now there are words.  

I didn't write them _yet here they are_ slumming on my screen. 

I thought them, I won't lie.  

But write them?  Put them on the blog?  Who would do that?  

Who's running this show?

Really?  

Alright then, who's the producer?

Well, who financed it and how Jewish are they?

When I was thirteen.  

What are you insinuating?
