## The Worst of All Possible Moments in Popular Film

I think I speak for everyone when I say that the titular moment is, without question, the titular line.  The only sure way to prevent a titular line from being laughable is to have a short title named after a central character (_Napoleon Dynamite_, _Donnie Darko_) or a primary location (_Chinatown_, _Manhattan_).  Otherwise, you risk committing an _Independence Day_ ("We're going to live on!  We're going to survive!  Today we celebrate our Independence Day!") or _Back to the Future_ ("Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future!").  That both of those are examples end with exclamation points is fitting, because it is the emphatic quality of such statements which rips you from your comfortable suspension of disbelief and reminds you that you are, in fact, watching a movie.  Terrible moment, that is ... although there are some exceptions.  In Michael Mann's _Heat_, for example, Robert De Niro's McCauley twice says:
Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to
walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.

In Stanley Kubrick's _Full Metal Jacket_, Vincent D'Onofrio's effectively pulls  off 
Seven-six-two millimeter.  Full.  Metal.  Jacket.

But those exceptions only go to prove the rule.  For the most part, you wince when Sir Ian McKellen informs you that these nine shall be the fellowship of the Ring.  Where in this continuum does the following paragraph (ripped from my current chapter) fall?
In a recently discovered essay written shortly after returning from England in 1902, “Telic Action and Collective Stupidity,”
London describes how “the individual is capable of, and does perform, telic actions—that is, adjusts his acts to remote ends; a thing which society never does.” He laments the stupidity of the crowd, here functioning metonymically for society at large, which despite being composed of individuals capable of telic action, _en masse_ behave as if such feats of foresight are impossible. Although he posits no solution to this
problem—concluding somberly, that humans “are as individually wise as [they] are collectively foolish”—he strikes one optimistic note: it is possible for “two or three individuals, or a score, [to] organize a company or corporation and collectively perform telic actions.” Telic actions cannot be performed by **_acephalous_** organizations; democracy is hamstrung by “by the arrant idiocy of political organization.” Telic actions can only be undertaken by undemocratic organizations whose leaders are chosen not because they represent society at large, but because they do not. Such leaders will accelerate the process London
believes already at work: namely, that “from the facts of [human] history…the
trend of [social] development is toward greater and greater collective wisdom.”

I'm the only one likely to find that cheesy, right?  (Observant readers will find that [first sentence](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/what\_if\_i\_just\_.html) there familiar.  I swear I'm not cramming all my poor prose/excessive corniness into one paragraph.  Trust me, the rest of them are equally embarrassing.)

Would "Telic Action and Collective Stupidity" make a good group blog name?  

I am disappointed that the sentence that starts that paragraph has no mention of London Broil after all.  Do you mean that you're not even using these gems?

Wait, that gives me an idea.  You've already said that no one wants you on a panel about your dissertation, only on panels about blogging about your dissertation.  So, meta the whole thing up one level.  Write your dissertation about how it was to blog about your dissertation (well, the first one, which will now never be written.)  That will give plenty of space for things like footnotes to London's London Blake's _London_ London forces and less need to write about boring Jack London.  Then you can go to panels on blogging one's dissertation about blogging and you'll be one up on everyone else!  Plus the dissertation itself can just be cut-and-pasted blog posts.  Everyone wins.

Not very Brechtian of you, mein freund.

Not cheesy at all, btw. I'm reminded of an undergraduate game we used to play (when? guess) in which we'd agree on some silly word -- say, 'wombat' -- that all of us would have to include in the next paper we wrote. Good times, that. I think including acephalous in all your professional work, from here to eternity, should be your game. I've managed to slip it into mine (in the context of the acephalous manuscript of _The Awntyrs of Arthur_). Have I managed to get In The Middle in it yet? I don't know.

You know what's cheesy? Saw _The Lilies of the Field_ last night, and goddammit if the titular line didn't get worked into the dialogue in a _funny_ way. Bastards.

Once, in the appropriate place (and I'd have to say this qualifies), is just funny enough.

Rich,

It certainly would make a wonderful group blog name.  May have to start one, just to use it.  Sadly, I don't think blogging my dissertation about blogging will land me on any more panels, as it'll give truth to the lie that bloggers are self-important, solipsistic sorts who can't be bothered to remove their head from their ass.  

Karl, 

_Not very Brechtian of you, mein freund._

I'm not very Brechtian, most of the time ... which is my way I'm very easily annoyed by loud statements of the obvious, which is what I consider "YOU ARE WATCHING A FILM!" or "YOU ARE READING A BOOK!"  There are exceptions -- I seem to be writing that a lot these days -- but that has to do with execution, not theory, and I'm a fan of anything done well.  (How's that for a cheap, easy statement?)

I never turned inserting particular words into a game _per se_, but effectively did as much (and continue to do so) unintentionally, as I'm the type who gets addicted to words: "entail," for one; "meretricious," for another.  Sometimes they're more obscure, which is why my advisor's constantly writing "too cute" and "unnecessarily 'clever'" on my drafts.

Jonathan,

The question is, who will get the joke?  (And will the response be "too cute" and "unnecessarily 'clever'"?)

But in the case of _Independence Day_ there's never any chance of having any disbelief to suspend.  Try counting the number of Hollywood cliches deployed (answer: all), or, if you're a masochist, the number of plot holes (answer: uncountable).  I mean, this movie defines dramatic irony:  even though not a single character in the movie has ever heard of _War of the Worlds_, the movie itself is chock full of alien encounter film and literature (and other sf) allusions....
