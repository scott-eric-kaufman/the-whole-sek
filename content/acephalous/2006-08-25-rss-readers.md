## RSS Readers

As I proofed my latest post via TypePad's "preview" function, I noticed something odd:

It showed up on my RSS feed.  

That shouldn't happen when I preview something.  What I think is that because TypePad assigns a URL to a post when it's previewed, if I spend more than a half an hour proofing it, Feedburner—which trawls sites every half hour—picks it up. 

So if you read my posts via an RSS reader, I implore you to click "Read The Original Item," as that'll be the one in which all the errors are eliminated and lacunae filled in.\*

\* I'll save the deconstruction of the Google RSS Reader's employment of "original" for some other night.

They mean "originary."
