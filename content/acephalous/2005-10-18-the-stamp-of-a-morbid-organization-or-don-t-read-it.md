## The Stamp of a Morbid Organization; or, Don't Read It!

Many titles of entries written during the First Annual Acephalous George Eliot-a-Thon will be written by George Eliot.  That said: the entry previous to this one should not have been published.  I don't have the heart to delete it yet.  It stewed (if intermittently) on the back-burner all day and I ought to at least let it have its moment on the table.  It wants to be consumed.  But like any good cook, I know better than to let the food I prepare adjudicate its quality.  It is an unfit judge—kith if not kin, I venture, to the undergraduate essay which pleads for the superior mark its author almost desired enough to put forth what those in the rest of the world call "effort" in order to acquire it.  

So I put the previous post on the table with a disappointed scowl.  I encourage you to place your adventurousness back in the pocket from whence it came and save it for something more exotic.  I'll plate some Porteguese-Moroccan Fusion for you next week, I promise.  Just please, let that poor post die its quiet death.  (Were my delirium not itself delirious I would now segue into my now well-rehearsed schpiel about the importance of habitual writing.  But as it is and I doubly so, I'll refrain.)
