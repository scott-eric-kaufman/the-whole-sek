## But Lacan, He Said Names Were Meaningful

I've always wished my surname was a verb.\*  I'll sit there at my desk, chin cupped in palm, wishing my mother had possessed sense enough to marry "Gary Conquers," "Harry Rules" or, I don't know, "Steve Fornicates."  (Better than "Steve Jobs."  No one wants a curious green surname, no matter how it sleeps.)  My passion for verbal surnames was inflamed a few years ago, when I taught a student named "Elizabeth Spies."  ([You doubt me](http://cfp.english.upenn.edu/archive/2006-01/0070.html)?)  

In the age of Google, she is practically invisible, buried beneath the combined noise of her name and its various permutations.  As if the Queen of the same name and her elaborate network of spies (I'm looking at you, [Franky](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452287472/diesekoschmar-20)) weren't enough to foil casual efforts to locate Elizabeth, Google's insistence that someone searching for "Elizabeth Spies" may be interested in "Elizabeth's pies" and _its_ permutations seals the deal.  Not that I'm looking for Elizabeth, mind you, or that I want a less visible web presence.  

I only mention all this because I've spent the day trying to figure out what Edward said.  In this database, Edward said quite a bit.  In that one, many Edwards have said many things, but none of them are my Edward, so none of them said what I'd remembered my Edward said.  Frustrating in the extreme, I tell you.

So perhaps not having a verbal surname is a good thing.  I could've ended up in the imperative mood, forced to live my life under the strangest of directives: 
"Stanley, fish!" 

"Susan, sontag!"

"Wolfgang, iser!"

\*The desire to change my name may be genetic.  Upon immigrating to America, my grandmother and great-aunt changed their last name to "Starr."  Hollywood, you know.

Would it be boring to point out that your surname means "businessman"?  Not a verb, obviously, but meaningful.  (And Wolfgang's is the name of a river.)

But let me tell you, having a meaningful last name isn't all it's cracked up to be.

Things go in cycles, man.

Years ago, back when I wanted to be funny, I[wrote](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/letters/letters35.html): "I had a student once named "Tom Looms." I said, "Your name, it's a complete sentence." He wasn't amused. Nor did he, as expected, loom, neither as a weaving artisan nor as a sinister lurking presence."

[Soon After](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/letters/letters36.html), one Tim Durkin wrote:

_Dear McSweeney's and Karl Steel,_

_My favorite name-that-is-also-a-complete-sentence belongs to the author of \_The Screwtape Letters\_ and the Narnia series:_

_Clive Staples Lewis._ 

Hard to top that one.

Try having a last name that's an adjective!  It wasn't that exciting when I was in middle school. - TL

I had a friend in Scotland called Joseph King.  He got tired of people coming up to him and saying (as, truly, they did) 'you must be Jo King'.

My personal problem is that I have a surname that is, basically, more-or-less, a first name.  This means that people frequently call me 'Robert'.

When I was very young I used to rack my brain trying to figure out what a "Bryant" is and felt cheated by my name.  However, I feel I'm fortunate to be "Levi", which is a nice anagram for "live", "vile", "evil", and "veil", and to also have two names "Paul" and "Levi", such that I didn't know my legal name-- "Paul" --until I was much older.  That has to be worth something where the symbolic order is concerned.

When I was younger my mother bought me one of those cards that tell you what your name means. It said that Anthony meant priceless, which always gave me warm fuzzies. When I got older and realized that I could apply the little knowledge of language I had to boring things like my name I thought, "Hmm... well the prefix 'an' is a negation in Latin so 'thony' or some variation of it must mean price." This lead me on a search to see if I was correct and, like Oedipus before me, the search for knowledge was devastating. It began with my finding that the Latin for price was nothing like 'thony' and ended with my uncovering that Anthony has no known meaning and thus, since meaning must be known to be meaningful, my name meant nothing. My last name, Smith, is the generic name for a labourer and so I am a meaningless labourer; one of the unwashed masses. No solace in my middle name either, Paul, as it means 'small' or 'humble'. Even though using all three of my names appears somewhat boastful, they are three names that name, essentially, an almost nothing.

Off topic: Don't mind me--I'm just an adoring blurking fan who knows it's a good thing to speak one's appreciation aloud. Love this livingroom. Do you serve adult beverages after 5 to non-students? Really.  Nice joint.  Okay, going back to the couch.

well I was one of those lucky kids whose parents gave them six names so I could "choose"...including a hyphenated last name...all together and translated from a variety of languages it meant something like....shining star of life who invites peace and little birds next to the old lions...  Everyone was shocked when I got married, took my husband's last name and deleted all my middle names. "how...submissive of you..." said my university professor when he heard.....I said..maybe...but it saves time filling in transatlantic passenger disembarkation forms....

Anyway..names do make a difference.I once knew a guy named Forrest Andrews Gay. His initials were F.A.G. That went over well in highschool!
