James' description of "Vernon Lee" (Violet Paget), as transcribed by Edith Wharton:
The long lean face of a starved horse, large and intelligent eyes not wholly devoid of obliquity, a flabby pendulous nose covered with cutaneous scabs, an underhung jaw revealing a dental display of really deplorable character, and on her head, my dear boy, from nine to thirteen hairs.

Have I plugged the [Lee biography](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375400044/diesekoschmar-20) enough yet?Â
