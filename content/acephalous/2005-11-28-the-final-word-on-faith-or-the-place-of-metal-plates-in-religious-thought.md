## The Final Word on Faith; or, The Place of Metal Plates in Religious Thought

Anyone who knows me knows my opinion of religion runs in stride with that of [Bill](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0879462965)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1), er, [William James](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0679640118)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1).  I admire the will to believe in the face of all logical obstacles to faith.  But as [someone](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=tg%!F(MISSING)detail%!F(MISSING)-%!F(MISSING)B000002L9J%!F(MISSING)qid%!D(MISSING)1133233916%!F(MISSING)sr%!D(MISSING)8-1%!F(MISSING)ref%!D(MISSING)pd\_bbs\_1%!F(MISSING)v%!D(MISSING)glance%!s(MISSING)%!D(MISSING)music%!n(MISSING)%!D(MISSING)507846)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) once sort of said: "Some faiths' fathers are bigger than other faiths' fathers."  Close enough for government work.  I understand the lure of tradition, the comfort of struggle, the intuition of order and all the many reasons faith survives in a world without reason.  (I could discuss in great and grave detail the respect I have for the denizens of [The Weblog](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/) via a discussion of God as omnipresent syncategorem to their otherwise secular propositions.  Another night.)  That said, to respond to unreasonable reality by spending [$226 million](http://www.sptimes.com/TampaBay/102598/scientologyphotos.html) [etching science fiction novels](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/la90/la90-1f.html) from the fifties on stainless steel plates, wrapping those plates in Kevlar and burying them in [bunkers](http://terraserver.microsoft.com/image.aspx?T=1&S=10&Z=13&X=2694&Y=19656&W=3) [smacks](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2005/11/analysis-of-smacking.html) of untenable thought.  Especially when those bunkers bear [the symbol](http://terraserver.microsoft.com/image.aspx?T=1&S=10&Z=13&X=2694&Y=19656&W=3) of [The Church of Spiritual Technology](http://www.sc-i-r-s-ology.pair.com/).  Unhinged from tradition, faith becomes a unsound enterprise productive of nothing other than unstable minds.  

While I cannot identify the precise moment when faith slips from struggle to suspect irrationality, I can say in no uncertain terms that once you consider etching [_Battlefield Earth_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)1592120075)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) on stainless steel plates to better bury them deep beneath the Nevada desert a fine idea, you've crossed the line.

_Unhinged from tradition, faith becomes a unsound enterprise productive of nothing other than unstable minds._

Well yes, yes, yea and yes; although your statement suggests correlatives: (a) How wacked-out was, say, Christianity in AD 60 or so? (b) In 500 years time will Scientology have acquired the shibboleth 'tradition' and merit respectful treatment?  Whereas the wacked-out bits of Christianity ('this bit of bread _literally turns into God!_ Look!  There it goes!') are surely not made sane and rational just because they've been around a long time; and engraving Battlefield Earth on stainless steel is always going to look like an odd waste of time and effort, surely.  Unless you're a Dada artist seeking to pour Situationist scorn on contemporary literary production.  Which I guess these people aren't.

You're braver than I, Adam.  My essentially similar reply got added to the [Invisible Acephalous](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/so\_is\_this\_a\_masculine\_space/#5588).

Since Elron is the only SF writer to ever make it to the truly big time, couldn't we just sort of imagine that they're doing this a few hundred years from now, when it'll be just as respectable as all those reliquaries with pieces of the True Cross?  (Even more, actually, because in this case it is guaranteed to actually be a copy of \_Battlefield Earth\_.)  Almost all revealed religions seem to go through an early encasing phase, and I don't see why we should deny them their fun just because we happen to live during their early days.

But clearly I'm speaking not from bravery so much as professional envy.  I mean, what is it going to take to get _my_ pulp SF engraved on titanium sheets and stored in UltraTitanium boxes forever?  What, eh?  My own private religion?  My private religion _with its own yacht_?  My private religion _with its own yacht on the deck of which cavort famous filmstars_? What?

There's one problem with your thinking here, Adam:

You don't write dreck.  

That is all.

I would say that's an _excellent_ test.  Although I'd add in something about extended proximity to Tom Cruise as well.  OK, it's a work in progress.

While looking over a  book about near death experiences I found a catalogue of world religions and a basic overview of the beliefs. People will believe six impossible things before breakfast. I can sympathize with Hubbard's puckish urge to spoof. To have it taken seriously ? I can't imagine.

It only goes to prove that Mormonism is Scientology plus 150 years.  (Remember that the Book of Mormon was supposedly written on gold plates, and I'm not even going to remind you what Mitt Romney's favorite book is).  

Best,  

John.
