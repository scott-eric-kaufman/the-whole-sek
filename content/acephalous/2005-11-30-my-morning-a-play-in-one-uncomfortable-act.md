This continues for a couple more minutes. He shouts profanity, she starts crying, &c. About two minutes later the couple emerges and I get some nasty looks. Who am I to stop them from having sex in my office?

Aren't those office doors in Krieger Hall normally locked?  How did they get in there?

They are, which is one of the reasons I had Kathleen put in a request to change the locks on my office door.  I believe what happened is that since my once spacious office is now [being filled](http://acephalous.typepad.com/officespace.jpg) with departmental detritus, someone left the door unlocked when he or she left.  Still (_shivers_) I hope they haven't been doing this all quarter.

Apparently the director in your mind didn't 'cue porno music' at the right time to allow you to join in and get supa-freaky.  That is what usually happens, right?

Please tell me you are not serious. This actually happened?

People were having sex in your office and they told you to get out? What?

Like Bill, I'm dying to know: are these students? physical plant staff? colleagues? The scenario is a bit different depending on which it is. If it's students, that's especially alarming from a number of standpoints: how did they get in? I'd check my computer if I were you.

Am I the only one who didn't think that this story sounded that odd?  Uh oh.

I mean, 18 year olds + no place to go (depending on their dorm policies or roommates or whatever) = inappropriate appropriation of any momentarily private space.  It's not like people are paragons of adult judgement and self-control at that age.

"Office" and "orifice" are easily confused words.

Did you ask them to come back later to sign copies of the surveillance videos?

Rich, it's someone's private office. Presumably with potentially confidential records in it that students in particular shouldn't be allowed to see. 

Fucking in the bushes or in the library stacks or in a classroom closet I get. Entering someone's private office I don't get. Would you just say, "Hey, horny young people with bad judgement" if you came home and two college students that you didn't know were screwing on your couch, having broken in your back door cause they were feeling horny and your house happened to be nearby when the lust struck them? I mean, jeezus. Plus telling someone to get out of their own office so you can \*finish your coitus\*? Wow.

"I'm not even upset; I'm amazed!"

In all seriousness... wow.

Rich, as a college student, I'm offended by your remarks :-p that's what closets are for!  Or at least a classroom for pete's sake.  Somebody else's office?  Never.

I guess I should clarify that Scott's right to have the locks changed, and that I certainly see why he'd be annoyed, and that the students involved sound even more self-centered than usual for people that age.  But the basic situation?  People have mentioned other places in which they wouldn't find this that surprising: the students, unlike Scott, probably didn't consider the office "filled with departmental detritus" to be an especially personal space, and I'd guess they found the door open.  I mean, it makes a good story, but my shockedness that this might happen is at a similar level to Capt. Renault's.

Is this part of the homosexual agenda I keep hearing about?  Now that gays get to come out of the closet, straights are expected to take their place?  Jeez.  Maybe the fundies are right.

What a great story.  I love the rubber door stopper part.  I take it that if you're having the locks changed, they were undergrads?

Sure it was your office, but you were ungenerous in your role as a teacher and scholar. Remember ultimately all of us have the same goal of advancing knowledge.

Forgive me, I didn't mean to sound pompous above, there was a loud knock on my door just as I prepared to comment, and it's not like people aren't out to get me these days.

Anyway, what I mean to say is that I can testify to profound effect these encounters can have on a psyche.

I have been the copulatee, not the copulator, in a few such instances and have always chucked it up to uncaring roommates back in the dormitory, insensitive to the intruder's biological urges.

And horomones. Lot's of hormones.

Rebecca S., since you're up there too, I'll answer you first: I'm 99% certain they were undergraduates. They may be very young graduate students from another department, but I doubt it. Nor do I think, as someone at the LJ staff meeting yesterday suggested, that they were exhibitionists, since the young lady left the room in tears. (I'm in 500C, that one on the corner facing HIB, and since the woman seemed reluctant to leave with me holding the door open, eventually my student and I went around to the side of the building so they could leave. I did really feel sorry for her in the end.)

Dave, I think they're living in the same world many people live in when they're that young, you know, the one in which they're invincible, correct on all counts, &c.

Tim and Rich, you're both right. My office may appear uninhabited because of all the desks--I should bring my camera Friday so you can see what I mean--but at the same time, the "clearing" I've created is obviously inhabited. There's no way a person can see my desk and not realize that it's someone's workspace. As for your concerns, Tim, as I said, I'm almost positive they were students, and since all I do on the computer in that office is use it to print stuff out, I'm not too worried about it. I did remove the student papers which, as someone who emailed me noted, is a particularly strange reaction. I'll just quote it:

> 1) Rampant sex fiends are apparently gaining entry into locked offices, where they proceed to do, well, what rampant sex fiends would do; and so
> 2) these same rampant sex fiends, disrespecting property as they do and exhibiting questionable moral character, would certainly (after all the sex was done) have an interest in gaining access to essays written by students who were busy writing essays instead of engaging in lewder activities, and would add insult to injury by making off with assorted papers they found in the office they so recently desecrated (perhaps because, what with all the rampant activity and all, they probably haven't had all that much time to craft essays of their own, and would think nothing of pilfering work from other students and doing god knows what unspeakable things with it, since they're not even students from your class), and yet
> 3) they would have no interest in pilfering your books, which are far more expensive and, I imagine, interesting.

The ironic part of this story is that on Tuesday I had a student tell me about her [Sociology 69](http://eee.uci.edu/05f/69200) class the day before. It's almost as if that conversation left its mark on the room.

"they would have no interest in pilfering your books, which are far more expensive and, I imagine, interesting"

The single most true sentence that Zelazny ever wrote was the one about how no one except your friends ever steal your books.

As for the student papers, well, there's a Joe Sacco comic book story about someone having his office inappropriately used for sex that I don't think I should even summarize further. But the papers might have been -- er -- marked up, let's say.

Seems to me like it kinda defeats the whole "fear of getting caught" thing to act all indignant and pretend like it was your right to be there. But then, I've always wondered how those "fear of getting caught" people would react if they were, in fact, caught.

The perfect moment for...a can of pepper spray!!

First shot in the eyes, second one quite a bit lower. I promise you they would never even consider trying this in someone's office again.

Maybe you might want to consider putting one of those live webcams in your office with a motion sensor and an open access to the school intranet so that anyone who decided to use your office after hours would be on public display.

Even more fun you could set up a remote to a tear gas cannister so about the time said couple was really getting their freak on the public could enjoy their reaction to getting tear-gassed and running out into the hall naked.

A little creative application of blurred-out spots might even get you $10,000 on America's Funniest Videos or something similar.

as entertaining as Wayne's 10:19 scenario would be, you do realize that the "perpetrators" woulld then become "victims," would sue -- and would win big; would thus cost both the Prof and the University big-time; and would then become celebrities, raking in even more buckage for years to come.

Oh my goodness. Wow. I should be careful. Not that my office is unlocked, but that it's out of the way, and well-heated, and would probably be very comfortable.

Not that I really think this would happen...

No, no, this is the best bit:

HALF-NAKED MALE: STOP HARASSING US YOU PERVERT OR I'LL REPORT YOU!

ME: (still holding door) You'll report me for your having sex in my office?

Given the undergrad's state at the time, I suppose a lack of rational thought was to be expected, but it's still funny.

Not to pick nits, but frankly the cranial energy it took to decide to have sex in someone's office isn't exactly a high voltage situation. Couple that (pun intended) with a blood flow moving away from the brain into the nether regions..and Kaufman is probably lucky to get THAT much.

This made my day, btw. LOL

I mean, it makes a good story, but my shockedness that this might happen is at a similar level to Capt. Renault's.

I don't think he meant "shocked" as in, "I'm astounded that undergraduates would think to have sex in my office!"

I think he means "shocked" as in, "Ohmigod, there are naked people having sex in my office!"

I seriously doubt that anyone, no matter how blase, could walk in on two strangers having sex in an unexpected place and NOT be shocked. It's like Miss Manners once said, "There's no point in planning what one would say in that situation, because you will always blurt out, 'Hey, what are you doing?' when it's perfectly obvious exactly what they're doing."

Sorry, the sex in the office I get. When you're ready to go, who cares who's office it is? You're thinking about sex, not robbery -- you're thinking you probably won't get disturbed. But the outrage upon being discovered takes the cake! I love that. Aside from due concern about locks and papers, come clean: You've been laughing about this all day, right? I mean, let's face it. It is absolutely a perfect human moment from all points of view. :-)
