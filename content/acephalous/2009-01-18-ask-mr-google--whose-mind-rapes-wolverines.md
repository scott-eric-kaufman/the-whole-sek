I have this whole back-log of the odd questions people ask Google that they think, for whatever reason, I can answer.  I'm just trying to, um, help them out?  Mock them?  One of the two.

The only downside, as I see it, is that posting these things actually makes it more likely that people asking similar questions will find you....
