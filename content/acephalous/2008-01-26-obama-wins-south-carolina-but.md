## Obama Wins South Carolina, But ...

... I'm watching his victory speech and am a little confused by all [these](http://acephalous.typepad.com/southcarolina01.jpg) [_things_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/southcarolina02.jpg) in [the](http://acephalous.typepad.com/southcarolina03.jpg) [background](http://acephalous.typepad.com/southcarolina04.jpg).  Am I supposed to know what they are?  Because I can only half see them.  

Much as I can tell, they _resemble_ people, but I don't remember ever seeing anything like them behind a candidate who wasn't conceding something.  Seems like they've always been hidden right out in the open—that is, they would have been there had I only realized it.  I couldn't see them before because I didn't expect them to be there, since I believed someone else had taken care of that.  

Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, whatever they are, they might speak for us all?

No, I can see those fine.  It's the things holding them giving me fits.  Have the Democrats discovered some new kind of stick?

Sure, Barack Obama won the South Carolina primary with the help of black voters. The real story, though, went unreported by the media until today, and that is that the Clintons lost that election because they are baby pinchers. While they are supposedly bending over to kiss a baby, they actually pinch it. If you don't believe me, maybe you'll believe the Associated Press:

 __ 

_The Associated Press has looked at thousands of hours of videotape and noted that almost all the babies were not crying before the Clinton kiss, but were crying immediately afterwards. In addition, throngs of teary-eyed mothers have provided pictures of the welts and bruises allegedly left behind by the pinchers, and in some cases, they have brought the babies to reporters to see the bruising first hand._ 
 _When asked to comment earlier today, former President Bill Clinton wagged his finger, looked straight into the camera, and said: "I did not have a pinching relationship with that ... baby."_ 

_..._    

www.msnbc/babypinching-myrtle.html

PARODY WARNING: This is a parody. There is actually no conclusive video evidence of "baby pinching," and in fact, the "Clinton Baby Pinching Ring," which is what they like to be called now, denies, categorically, any baby pinching. Do not take this parody on an empty stomach. Ask your doctor if parody is right for you. That is all.

Vote OBAMA in '08.

Well, this will be great.  Black folks will support Obama.  White women will support Clinton.  White men will support Edwards.  No matter who wins at the Convention, two groups will feel alienated by the winner.

LB: I think "prefer" is probably a better word than "support," since chances are these democrats will support whoever ends up as the one candidate. Feelings of alienation are inevitable, but remember that this is perhaps less a problem with the democrats than with the other side: after all, the corporate-cons want Romney, the neocons want Giuliani (and have McCain as cold comfort), and the theocons want Huck, and however violent the disagreement on our side, it's far worse on theirs.

I agree with Karl: it's about preference more than support.  I'll "support" Clinton if she wins the nomination, but I'd _prefer_ to support Obama.

And for the record, since I received some mail: everything after the first sentence comes from Ralph Ellison's _Invisible Man_, just modified for the moment.

Wow, I'm kind of fond of that book. I'm surprised I didn't recognize it at first.

SEK: Your observation made [this postscript to the victory part by Gal Beckerman](http://www.cjr.org/campaign\_desk/mass\_media\_criticism.php) really very fascinating. The crowd itself is a text which everyone, including the crowd itself, interprets...

Hermit Greg, I actually noticed the placement of white people directly behind Obama, since the media undercut his staff's efforts by showing reaction shots of the crowd -- it seemed like 90 percent of the white people in the room were directly behind him, which was, obviously, to the benefit of his message.  As to mine, though, I was more heartened by the general air of enfranchisement exuded by the audience.  Hence, _The Invisible Man_.

There are other "invisible" people influencing this primary election. See if you can spot it in the following:  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

Heidi Przybyla and Indira Lakshmanan   

Mon Jan 28, 10:48 AM ET  

Jan. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Barack Obama, fresh from a landslide victory over Hillary Clinton in the South Carolina Democratic presidential primary, plans to continue a campaign that is long on the need for change and inspiration and short on specifics.   

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Note the last clause of that long sentence. If you put that clause togther with it's subject, it reads: 

Barack Obama ... plans to continue a campaign that is long on the need for change and inspiration and short on specifics. 

Did Barack Obama say that? Did one of his chief advisors say that? Is that a matter of fact, now? How did Clinton Talking Point #1 get into the first sentence of a Bloomberg wire report about Obama's South Carolina victory? Because nobody was quoted, I'm suggesting invisible people.

In [this](http://z.about.com/d/politicalhumor/1/0/F/C/hillary\_closer.jpg) picture, you can see baby-pincher Hillary Clinton with that oh-so-familiar look that baby pinchers get right before they "get their pinch on." The poor baby doesn't know know what's coming. The other woman pictured is what Clinton staffers call a "baby wrangler." These baby wranglers pick up babies in the crowd and then hand them off to the Clintons for what is supposed to be an innocent photo op. In reality, it's just a ploy to give the candidate the addictive high associated with baby pinching.   

The words printed above the baby's head are obviously photo-shopped by some Clinton advisor onto the picture AFTER it was taken. Everyone knows that you can't see words that are being thought. 

PARODY WARNING: This is a parody. The preceding words are not true, unless, of course, there has been some remarkable coincidence. So, well, I guess the statements expressed herein are PROBABLY not true, but anything is impossible. For more information about baby pinching and how to prevent it, call 1-800-NO-PINCH. Confidential operators are standing by. 

OBAMA IN '08 (He's no baby pincher)!
