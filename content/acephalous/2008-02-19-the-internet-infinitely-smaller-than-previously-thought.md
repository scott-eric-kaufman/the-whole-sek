## The Internet: Infinitely Smaller Than Previously Thought

Few months back _[This Recording](http://thisrecording.wordpress.com/)_ linked here.  Poking around the site, I noticed a link to _[joshsisk.com](http://joshsisk.com)_ on the blog-roll and thought: "I (sort of) knew a Josh Sisk in high school."  

I clicked through and to his "[about me](http://joshsisk.com/about/)" page and _wouldn't you know_?  Same Josh Sisk I (sort of) knew in high school.  He mentions having [another blog](http://www.killoggs.com/) and, stalker I am, I click through.

Only his other blog isn't his alone: it's a group-blog that includes a number of other people I (sort of) knew in high school (as well as [one person](http://www.killoggs.com/log/posts/2007/11/03) I considered a close friend).  

Not to be an alarmist here, but I _**BELIEVE THE INTERNETS IS SHRINKING**_.  

Soon the day will come when everyone you ever knew knows you again.  Your hated rivals will link to your profile on [_HatedRivals.com_](http://www.hatedrivals.com/).  Elementary school bullies will link post about the beatings they delivered on [_IOnceKickedHisAss.com_](http://www.ioncekickedhisass.com) and fellow bullies will rate them. 

You will all be _Facebook_ friends.  _We_ will all be _Facebook_ friends.  

So it is written.  

So it has been foretold.

I think the more likely inference is that I contain the entire internet in my brain, and this connection is the neural equivalent of a new pathway. I contain your past present and future blogs. The interweb shall be mine.

Two of my friends first met in a chatroom, in which they discovered they were both living in the same country. In the same part of the same country. As students. At the same university. Both on campus right now, in fact. In... wait... which computer lab? Um, stand up and wave? Ah! Hi! I see you!

I had an old girlfriend find me through Facebook recently.  She sent a note; I didn't reply.  I did, however, look at her picture.  Wow.  She looks nothing like she did when we dated in high school.  

It is my most fervent desire that everyone who ever knew me does ~not~ come to know me again.  

Please stay away. 

Am I mean?

Yes, you are.  As soon as the site "goes live" I will be registering you [here](http://www.meanpeople.com/).  

(Note: I did not google this place.  I simply assumed that it had to exist, and the internet provided.)

I feel bad for the private detectives who are losing all of this work, and there are sometimes good reasons for it to be somewhat difficult to get back in touch with the people we have lost track of.  

A friend recently relayed the story of googling an ex. The relationship had ended abruptly and badly a few years back, but she was curious as to how they were doing. She thought that she had located the ex in a new city at a job that would make sense, but how could she be sure that it was the same person?  Figuring that it was the weekend she called their work number to see if the correct voice would be on the voice mail.  Of course, the ex answered.  My friend was not smart enough to hang up and had to spend the next five minutes trying to sound like less of a stalker than she was.

Largely what is demonstrated is how far any one of us is willing to go dealing with the voices in their own head. Myself, I can get quite far, since I have always thought I existed in a multitude, and those voices might belong to others--who, being very shy, might want me to be the one doing most of the talking. Convenient point of view for a writer? Yes.

GAH!  You people need to stop sneaking up on me like that.  Christ, I _need_ this heart, you know.
