A first-time commenter named "Kaye" [writes](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/sicko.html#comment-73195830) in response to [my review of _Sicko_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/sicko.html):
Scott! I was a PA on Bowling and 911 and forwarded this to Mike. Here's
his response: "you mean people who agree w/ me will talk about sicko
more? terrible! re: pirates tell the kid under no circumstances should
he throw parties and invite everyone he knows over or host community
screenings or leave copies in the stalls at the nixon museum. were up
to me i'd sell two tickets at $100m each and destroy the masters. can't
have people see the movie! terrible!"

She left an anti-spam email, so I can't write her back, and as I've never 
corresponded with Moore myself, I can't vouch the style, but it _sounds like_ Moore, so I've no choice but to assume it's authentic.  (_pulls gold 
monocle from frock coat and secures it_)___I_ have famous 
readers.  Do _you_ have famous readers?  No?  (_adjusts top hat_)  How 
dreadful.  (_reflects on life of three long minutes ago_)  I remember what 
it was like to be inconsequential, my tiny voice unread by the best people.  
(_sighs_)  

Dark days, my friends, dark days.

Well, if MMoore is reading this two things: 

1) I'm not a crier, but I had tears in my eyes as I watched the Oprah thing. It was the greatest television of the last... well, in a long time. 

2) Despite Scott's claim in the other thread that the target audience are the Dem candidates in the primaries, I had another amazing, tear producing experience a week later. My dad (republican, definitely on the anti-socialism side of the ledger came to visit). We were talking about this and that and out of the blue he asked me if I had seen Michael Moore on Oprah. (My dad watches Oprah? wtf?) He then started rattling on about what bullshit the health insurance system is. And, most stunningly of all, repeated just about word for word Oprah's epiphany about the police department and fire department and school and the rest. "Those things are socialist, but no one gets scared about them!" This absolutely blew my mind, and suggests that this film has already and will continue to have a potentially transformative effect upon this troubled nation of ours. 

So, if he comes back around, thanks Michael. Amazing...

SEK: Will your new pseudonym, or radio handle, now be "Pirate"?  If no, will you allow for "Neo-Pirate," "Pseudo-Pirate," or "Almost-Pirate"? - TL
