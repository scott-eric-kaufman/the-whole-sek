I have no idea where the left column went.  Will try (and likely fail) to correct.  Then cry (most certainly) and email someone who can.

Well the left column is still in its accustomed place -- it's just the _contents_ of the column that have gone missing. I wouldn't worry about it too much though, these blogs really have minds of their own, I'm sure the contents will come back in the morning hung over and try and sleep it off...

Your page's source has a ton of error messages stuck in as HTML comments. It looks like something is acting up at the level of a Perl module that parses templates. Which makes it seem unlikely that a particular thing you did in a post is the cause.
