## Dreamy Architecture & Communion With the Dead (Suspected, Never Verified)

On the way to San Francisco we stopped to visit [The Winchester Mystery House](http://www.winchestermysteryhouse.com/).  [![49\_urbino](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/49\_urbino.jpg "49\_urbino")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/49\_urbino.jpg) What intrigued me about this place is how much it resembles, in house-form, the architectural mode that makes Urbino the most interesting city on the planet.  Characterized by more local decisions with global consequences than the world's witnessed prior to the current adminstration's "management" of domestic, international and interpersonal politics, Urbino was built in fits and starts over a couple of hundred years, resulting in a scene-scape which resembles a dream-scape more than a city-scape.  Building upon building ascending endlessly (until reaching the [birthplace of Raffaello](http://www.ettoreortenzi.it/images/Lib\_OggettiVari/Urbino\_pic\_CasaRaffaello.jpg)) and then with burning calves and tightened thighs you turn and realize that not only can you ascend further but that the two available routes appear suddenly, as if the walls on your right rift for you alone.  To your left is a path hardly discernable from the walls which border it and seems to consist of three ramps, seven of steps, then a stairway of such unreal steepness you reach for the ropes you'll undoubtedly need to descend it.  

The[![Winchester\_mystery\_house\_022](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/winchester\_mystery\_house\_022.jpg "Winchester\_mystery\_house\_022")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/winchester\_mystery\_house\_022.jpg)  Winchester Mystery House, while not quite as counterintuitive as Urbino, is as haphazardly constructed (only not nearly so substantial).  Its owner, the widowed heiress of the Winchester Rifle fortune, invested her inheritance in a lucrative scheme to ameliorate the souls (mostly Native American) wounded and killed by Winchester rifles.  So she built stairs ascending into ceilings, doors which open onto fifteen foot falls or bricked-up walls, &c.  I'll post more pictures whenever I figure out how to exploit Flickr's more than ample bandwith.  I realize how "bloggy" this entry is.  I may well deserve banishment to livejournal.  At least I'm not whinging about things I'm incapable of changing.

No, no, keep doing this while on your trip.  I love this sort of thing.  Never thought of it as bloggy.  I thought bloggy was navel-gazing.

But does the Mystery House have a study to match the one in the palace in Urbino?

EB, 

I certainly doesn't.  Then again, Winchester spent all her time communing with spirits, and they've little use for books (outside of throwing).
