## The Entire Eastern Seaboard Is The New Black

I can't think of any other reason Bill Schroeder and Brian Anderson of FSN Wisconsin spent _ten minutes_ discussing how articulate Chesapeake, Virgina native [David Wright](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David\_Wright\_(baseball\_player)) is.  As in:
"What surprises you when he talks is how articulate this young man is.  You just don't expect it."

"You're telling me this kid skipped college?  I know college graduates who aren't half as well-spoken."

"The thing you have to love about Wright is that he's always smiling that big smile of his.  He's always happy to doing his job."

Does _everyone_ looks black when you come from Wisconsin?  I'm reminded of a passage from Chesnutt's [_The Marrow of Tradition_](http://books.google.com/books?id=2ch8PsEzvO4C&printsec=titlepage&dq=) (1901):

In order to give the visitors, ere they left 
Wellington
 _New York_, a pleasing impression of 
Southern
 _Eastern_ customs, and particularly of the joyous, happy-go-lucky disposition of the 
Southern
 _Eastern_ darky and his entire contentment with existing conditions, it was decided by the hotel management to treat them, on the last night of their visit, to a little diversion, in the shape of a genuine 
negro cakewalk
 _baseball game_.

The whole South is black, SEK. You are the funny one from Louisiana. Sort of like the Sammy Davis Junior to Kotsko's Sinatra.

Actually, I suspect it's more class: athletes, especially ones that didn't go to college, are assumed to be _lumpenproletariat_, and impression enhanced by the habit of interviewing them after physically taxing displays and in loud, chaotic environments.

Um, why are you so prejudiced against people from Wisconsin?

From what you quote, it sounds like they were impressed with his communication skills, given his (known) lack of formal education. What exactly is wrong with this?
