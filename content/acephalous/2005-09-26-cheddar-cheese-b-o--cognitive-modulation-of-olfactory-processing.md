"Cognitive Modulation of Olfactory Processing" (_Neuron_ 46, no. 4) has implications for literary theory which, were it not for today's extreme case of density, I would certainly tease out.  The researchers
showed how cognitive, semantic information modulates olfactory
representations in the brain by providing a visual word descriptor, "cheddar cheese" or "body odor," during the delivery of a test odor
(isovaleric acid with cheddar cheese flavor) and also during the
delivery of clean air. Clean air labeled "air" was used as a control.
Subjects rated the affective value of the test odor as significantly
more unpleasant when labeled "body odor" than when labeled "cheddar
cheese." 

[...]

The important new point being made in this paper is that high-level
cognitive inputs, _such as_ _the sight of a word_, can influence the
activations in brain regions that are activated by olfactory stimuli
such as the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex and the
amygdala. Moreover, the high-level cognitive influence can modulate
affective ratings of pleasantness and the brain regions such as the
anterior cingulate/medial orbitofrontal areas where the activations are
correlated with the pleasantness of odors.

I momentarily thought the emphasized phrase above meant that these researchers were familiar with De Man.  That the materiality of the signifier has _finally_ been accepted by the scientific community.  Then:
Use of a word label as the cognitive input ensured that the cognitive
input was high level and semantic. If we had used a picture of cheese
or of a body part, this could have been a lower level association, in
that neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex respond to visual stimuli such
as the sight of food.

These neuroscientists clearly have _not_ read their De Man: pictures of cheddar cheese would have created lower-level associations than the words "cheddar cheese."  I imagine this study has implications for any philosophical school which assumes the disconnect of signifier from signified.  I wish I could wrap my head around what those implications would be but I'm having a hard enough time wrapping my head around simple arithmetic today.  Higher-order cognitive functions like "thinking about poststructuralist accoutns of language" are out of the question.

Full disclosure: I may have done this to myself.  I've listened to Danger Doom's _[The Mouse and the Mask](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000B9EYDY/102-1567057-4760905)_ three
times through today.  MF Doom's probably rap's most gifted lyricist and
DJ Danger Mouse is on an absolute tear--the tiny falsetto trapped in my
temple sings "feels good" on the quarter hour all day long--but for
despite all that talent the lyric lodged in my brain belongs to [Brak](http://ffmedia.ign.com/filmforce/image/andymerrill2-brak.jpg):

Check me out,   
my name is Brak.   
I got a mom and a dad

and a yard out back.   
We sit by the pool   
and we nibble our snacks,   
then
we eat a big lunch   
and we all take naps.   

Why'd the beat stop?
