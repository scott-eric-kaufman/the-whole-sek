. . . [BURNING SHIT DOWN](http://kfmonkey.blogspot.com/2005/10/lunch-discussions-145-crazification.html), which must be why neither the _[Los Angeles Times](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/files/2009/06/priorities.jpg)_ nor [Twitter](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/files/2009/06/priorities.jpg) will load. I admit that watching the social media site come into its own in response to an international crisis makes me wonder whether I ought to be a little less cynical of the political power of new media and the political engagement of the online generati—_what_?

[You have _got_ to be kidding me](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/arts/music/26jackson.html?\_r=1&hp).

Somewhere in Tehran, an Iranian protester's desperatetly punching his jerry-rigged mobile device trying to figure out what the fuck happened to Twitter.

Stop.  Wait.  Are you going to say that the utterly unexpected death of the most important pop artist, worldwide, since the Beatles is not an absolutely earthshaking news story?  Or that people should, I don't know, not post their shock, sadness, and fond memories online because we need to keep this line clear?  Because I'd love to hear your argument for either of those propositions.

_Are you going to say that the utterly unexpected death of the most important pop artist, worldwide, since the Beatles is not an absolutely earthshaking news story?_

I'm happy to say it. MJ hasn't made any decent music since 'Smooth Criminal,' and there's no evidence he ever would again. Nor, since then, has he been an ambassador of good will, or a force for good in any obvious sense commensurate with the duties his enormous wealth should have imposed on him. In many ways, quite the contrary.

In other words, what did the world lose in his death? What will his death change? Nothing. And it will possibly be improved in some slight ways.

At best, there's really no more significance to his death than the (to my mind) sadder death (and contemporary) of Sky Saxon of The Seeds, another great musician whose days of relevance were decades past.

I'll say it first: Ahmadinejad killed him. Farrah Fawcett was a warm-up, to see if it would work. Then they went for Ed McMahon. It got some of the focus away, but not enough, so they escalated. If this doesn't work, I'd hate to be Kermit the Frog's security detail.

Karl, I know just what you mean.  I'm going through the same thing with my grandmother.  Sure, she had a nice life and whatever, and I have a lot of fond memories of time we spent together, but honestly the last quality time I spent with her was more then a decade ago, and ever since she got sick—forget about it!  How could I possibly be sad about her passing?

Anyway, Scott must be comforted by your comment, in that his post will look less callous by comparison.

Mourning the death of a person who wrote pop songs you liked is like mourning the death of your grandmother, a person you actually spent time with? Doesn't make sense.

Without weighing in on whether the amount of media attention devoted to this man's death is appropriate or not, I did like Richard Kim's obituary for him: [http://www.thenation.com/blogs/notion/446177/michael\_jackson\_freak\_like\_me](http://www.thenation.com/blogs/notion/446177/michael\_jackson\_freak\_like\_me)

I'm not sure what's so callous about lamenting the fact that 1) the natural death of a single pop singer pushed Iran out of the news cycle while 2) simultaneously crashing the social networking site that the media's gone ape-shit with hyping its political importance.  It's sad, frankly, and speaks to our cultural priorities.

Look, people mourn the dead.  This is not culturally specific.  Furthermore, people mourn the deaths of those who made them very happy, regardless (pace Karl) of whether they knew them personally, or whether their Cultural Productivity is still at its heighest level.  This has been true of pop stars, sports stars, politicians, and religious figures, for as long as there have been people who were loved outside their immediate community.  There's nothing sad about it, except to someone who holds human emotion in contempt.

If Iran had been pushed out of the news by an American Idol win or something, you'd have a point, but death is death.  The idea that, upon hearing this upsetting news, people should be expected to think, "With what's going on in Iran, how can I care about a death of a human being I admire?" should produce either horror or incredulous laughter; last night it was still raw so I felt the former, but I'm tending towards the latter at the moment.

Let's say it this way:  it's obviously not unexpected that people would comment on Michael Jackson's death, but what's going on in Iran is more important than MJ's death, and the relative levels of response illustrate our cultural priorities and how we'll make use of the new social media.

To elaborate, I don't think Scott was saying we shouldn't mourn MJ at all (Karl was though.)  

He was saying that the level of concern compared to the concern shown for the Iran situation is alarming.  I concur, given that in the next few decades, the ultimate leadership of Iran may be a big factor in The History Of Western Civilization.

I've seen less mourning than jeering.  People are free to be interested in whatever interests them, but I do agree it's sad that the death of someone who has been, for at least a decade, little more than a punchline in a series of exhausted running jokes, has taken over the news cycle for the foreseeable future.  Of course a co-worker (a summer intern, actually, from a Good School) commented recently "I turned on CNN and they were talking about Michael Jackson.  I'm just glad they stopped talking about all that crap in Iran.  That was getting sooooo old."

Let's say it this way: it's obviously not unexpected that people would comment on Michael Jackson's death, but **what's going on in Iran is more important than MJ's death**, and the relative levels of response illustrate our cultural priorities and how we'll make use of the new social media.

(My emphasis.) World-historically you're most likely right. To each individual Twitter user, according to each user's perception, you're wrong of course. (How many Iranians do you know? How many Michael Jackson fans? How many times have you listened to his songs? He's in your bedroom, your stereo of course. Iran is a notion cooked up to scare children; Michael Jackson is part of my life.)

But leave that aside. People mourn loudly and 'pointlessly' precisely _because_ other shit is big, impersonal, distant, complicated, upsetting in a way that social structures can't seem to help with. I've mourned dead individuals before, including a mommy(!); never had to sift through little 140-character messages about political unrest halfway around the world. Being upset about Iran is outside my areas of expertise. Crying about Michael Jackson makes the other shit make sense.

I mean, _obviously_.

This has nothing to do with 'priorities,' it's about _core emotional competencies_. Humans didn't evolve to empathize with people literally on the other side of the earth. Music enables emotional connection; websites crashing just signal the intensity of the energy people didn't realize they'd stored.

This is all to leave aside, as well, that Jackson was a compelling genius/victim/madman blend. His story exposes ugly priorities of another sort, about children and fame and so forth, which will still be ugly and frightening no matter which handpicked religious zealot runs Iran.
