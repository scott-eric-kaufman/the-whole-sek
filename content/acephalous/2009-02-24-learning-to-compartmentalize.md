Two recent posts on _Edge of the American West_ that I haven't x-posted because my talkativeness ≠ self-importance of the you-must-read-all-I-write variety.  But because I do talk and write too much:

*   [By all means, let them use their own rope](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/02/23/by-all-means-let-them-use-their-own-rope/).  (On _Big Hollywood_'s sexist and homophobic Oscar live-blogging.)
*   [And Bobby Jindal’s idea of a winning issue for Republicans is . . .](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/and-bobby-jindals-idea-of-a-winning-issue-for-republicans-is/) (On the ineffable rage I experienced after hearing Jindal's appropriation of [this particular issue](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/on\_the\_situatio.html).  Odd that Foxnews deleted so many of the links in that post there.  Wonder why they did that?)
