I'm only reposting this as prelude to nominating you for mensch of the year.

Hah. It's cool with me. I'd like to hear your version, though. I imagine they don't even have much in common, as my impressions were all filtered through a haze of irrational terror.

My version involves 1) much more concern for "Robert," 2) a belief you might have found him in a terrible state, and 3) that sort of horror-movie-watcher's yelling-at-the-screen DON'T DON'T DON'T OPEN THAT DOOR.  Now that I know Robert's in a safe place, jokes can be had, but my heart is still patter-patter-pattering like a freight train barreling down on a basket of kittens, so I might refrain doing my version for a day or two.  (Plus, I have _so many_ papers to grade that I couldn't even look at on my phone.)

Also, I appreciate the "this well-written" bit. Obviously we all work in the shadow of the disaster-diary master.

Heh. Considering that is the opening credits for like every single episode of Law and Order \*ever,\* I'm just glad the actual dude is ok.

Dude is ok, right? Leaving Halloween decorations up this late seems a bit odd, on top of forgetting to show up for things...

If there's a twilight zone quality to Scott's life, it's certainly boosted by the way he seems to convince people to step into it. The events all seem more or less reasonable, except for the one weird-ass thing that Todd was convinced that he had to pretend to be someone else. That's what puts it over the line into another absurd Scott story. I mean, you discussed whether he'd notice that the cap was from the wrong sports team? Was there prep on Watchmen too, just in case? "Whatever you do, don't say that Dr. Manhattan is a author-identification figure. That would tip him off right away. In my interpretation he figures as the reader." "All right. What does he know about what you think about Rorschach?"

Don't people usually call the police to check on someone, in a situation like this?

Rich: The "wrong team" thing wasn't something we discussed, it was just something out of place that I thought of on the way over to the guy's apartment. 

Jon: Yeah. Our grad student housing community actually has people who will make a "wellness check," as well. Every second person who has heard this story today has asked why we didn't call those people. I don't have a good answer. Everything that happened seemed to make sense at the time, though little of it does in retrospect.

Oh, I could easily understand not calling the police.  Sending the police into a situation like this is asking to get Robert shot, or at least tasered.  The grad student housing wellness check people presumably wouldn't do that, but then there still might be a distressing (for Robert) paper trail.

It's the "pretend you're me" thing that would send my 46-year-old not a good idea detectors going.  Followed shortly by "Wait, a minute, he liked Scott's interpretation of Watchmen, so Scott has to be the one who checks on him?  What?"  At that point I think I would have gone for just getting a group of 3-4 people from the department together to do it.

But that's after-the-fact, and it sounds like everything went fine.

I reckon Todd and Rich already addressed that, Mr. Excellent Article Network.

The reason Scott never thought to call the police stems from his childhood when his mom did not call the firemen until she was really sure the house was on fire -twice! He also must have thought he did not want to create a problem for a grad student unless there was a real problem.  Did no one wonder about the state of mind of the student who still had not cleaned up from Halloween when it is now Christmas?  Someone needs to check on this person.
