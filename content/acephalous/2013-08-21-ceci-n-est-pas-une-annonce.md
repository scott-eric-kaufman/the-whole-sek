Matt Zoller Seitz has [an article on Vulture](www.vulture.com/2013/08/there-has-been-no-better-time-for-tv-criticism.html) that helps answer a question many of you have asked me: "Where can I can find more stuff like the stuff you do?" Here's MSZ:

It’s customary to decry much TV writing, recaps especially, as  plot 
summary plus snark; I’ve done it myself. But as television  criticism 
has evolved, this catch-all insult has started to seem as lazy  and 
out-of-touch as cinephiles writing off the whole of television as  an 
idiot box.

Even those sites that adopt a lighter touch—such as [previously.tv](http://previously.tv/),
  the new site from Television Without Pity’s original founders—invest  
snark with imagination and a sense of play. Tara Ariano’s [“Schraders vs. Whites” chart](http://previously.tv/breaking-bad/schraders-vs-whites/) and _[Newsroom recaps](http://previously.tv/the-newsroom/its-worth-derailing-an-editorial-meeting-about-an-extremely-sensitive-story-to-count-santas-reindeer/)_, the [“watch/skip index,”](http://previously.tv/features/watch-skip-index/) and [“Ask the Experts”](http://previously.tv/the-bridge/ask-a-man-still-recovering-from-a-vasectomy/)
 are all riffs, but not just riffs; the site’s a welcome reminder that  
most people watch TV because it’s fun. (Though they do get serious on  
occasion: see [Sarah D. Bunting’s appreciation](http://previously.tv/the-sopranos/the-fini-a-salut/) of Tony Soprano as a prototypical Jersey dad.) [Pajiba’s Joanna Robinson](http://www.pajiba.com/tv\_reviews/10-things-we-learned-from-last-nights-faithtesting-episode-of-justified.php) does the most visually inventive recaps I’ve seen, using GIFs and screenshots as rimshots. At Lawyers, Guns and Money, [Scott Eric Kaufman’s detailed breakdowns](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/05/i-still-know-that-youve-seen-that-i-saw-you-miscommunication-in-second-sons-game-of-thrones) of composition and editing liven up the recap with a dash of film theory.

Look beyond the writers who churn out thousands of words a week,  and
 you’ll find many insightful, sometimes powerful one-offs, such as [Aura Bogado’s piece](http://www.thenation.com/blog/175786/white-new-white) accusing _Orange Is the New Black_
 of being unthinkingly racist even as it strives to enlighten. Bogado’s 
 target isn’t just the show, but the complacent white liberal  
point-of-view that dominates criticism in every field, not just TV.

Tom and Lorenzo’s style-oriented approach and Molly Lambert’s Grantland pieces—[on _Mad Men,_ especially](http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/\_/id/79159/mad-men-week-10-things-sally-will-never-unsee)—are
 a breed apart. They’re not recapping, exactly, and I don’t know if  
they’re reviewing or criticizing, either, but they’re definitely feeling
  and responding, and noticing, and at their best, they make art from  
art. [Tom and Lorenzo’s coverage](http://www.tomandlorenzo.com/tag/mad-style)
 adopts an outside-in approach, looking at the clothes, architecture,  
colors, and textures, and then finding their way into the drama, but  
they do [more straightforward criticism](http://www.tomandlorenzo.com/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of.html) as well, and it’s often dazzling.

Yes, I see what I did there too. But soon I'll be able to provide another answer: "At _The Onion_ AV
 Club's 'Internet Film School,'" which will be me. I'll provide a link 
when it goes live in the next week or two. In the meantime, enjoy the 
bounty of links MSZ provided. (I'm not saying there'll be a pop quiz, 
but neither am I saying there won't be.)

Fuck it. I wrote this up about the diner scene in the latest _Breaking Bad_ episode and posted it [on IO9's Observation Deck](http://io9.com/indulge-me-here-one-of-my-favorite-moments-from-this-e-1178736998), but am going to hijack your comments section for a bit to re-post it, because I'm digging how _Breaking Bad_ is re-mapping the gangster cinema landscape.

--------------

Indulge me here:

One of my favorite moments from this episode was the diner. _Breaking Bad_ can be located in the tradition of the American gangster cinema, and it's been negotiating its place by creating a kind of visual dialog with other work in that genre. Back in "Gliding Over All," there was the assassination montage, which echoes the assassination/baptism montage from _The Godfather_. Water is the central image of both montages, and both scenes mark the turning point where the protagonists consolidate their power and take a final step over the moral line into the role of organized crime lord. 

In "Buried," we get the diner scene, which is an inverted echo of the diner scene in _Goodfellas_ where Henry Hill realizes that Jimmy is trying to set him up. The _Goodfellas_ scene starts with Henry's voice-over describing his existential dilemma, which could just as easily be Skyler's inner dialog (but being an inversion, we don't get the voice-over -- and _Breaking Bad_ doesn't do that anyway): "If you're part of a crew" (family), "nobody ever tells you that they're going to kill you" (bring you down) -- "doesn't happen that way. There weren't any arguments or curses like in the movies. See your murders come with smiles; they come as friends; the people that have cared for you all of your life and they always seem to come at a time when you're at your weakest and most in need of their help."

The _Goodfellas_ scene cuts to a tracking shot of Henry Hill entering the diner from Henry's perspective, while in "Buried" the camera is on Skyler (so the camera position is inverted). Both scenes start with a hug, and the reverse shot shows Henry/Skyler's tension.

So clearly Skyler's in the Henry position, and she's also a stand-in for Walt, since she's just as involved with Walt's business at this point (just as Karen's just as involved in Henry Hill's business). And Hank is in Jimmy's position trying to suss out Skyler/Henry Hill. But just as Hank being a cop is an inversion of Jimmy's being a gangster, so to is their respective positions in the scene, on opposite sides of the booth.

And Hank sliding over the voice recorder is the token used to try to finalize the set-up, which matches Jimmy sliding over the matchbook with the info of who he wants Henry to wack in Florida. In both cases, Skyler and Henry realize that if they use that token, they're done.

In both scenes, the subject under suspicion figures out that the person across the table is going to bring an end to their extra-criminal dealings, and possibly them. But while Henry reacts calmly and cooly, Skyler -- in the inverted scene -- has the opposite emotional reaction and creates a scene, "AM I UNDER ARREST?" If it wasn't clear that Skyler pulls that act just to get away from Hank without making Hank any more suspicious than he already is, Anna Gunn admitted as much on _Talking Bad_, saying that Skyler's reaction was just as calculated as anything Walt might do.

Of course the circumstances are different in the two scenes, and it's not an exact match, but it doesn't need to be. The _Goodfellas_ diner scene is one of those iconic moments of American gangster cinema, particularly because of the neat trick Scorsese pulled off with the background outside of the booth window. It's also a scene of recognition between characters who are trying not to give too much away to the person across the table from them while simultaneously trying to glean as much information as they can, and _everything_ depends on it.

All _Breaking Bad_ needs to do (and it doesn't _need_ to do this, it's just choosing to) is gesture to that moment from _Goodfellas_ through its own visual apparatus to recall what Scorsese managed to pack into his scene. In doing so, it simultaneously positions itself in relation to a touchstone of gangster cinema: "Here's Scorsese's take on two proxy family members pretending to be something they're not anymore to each other while also trying to figure out where the other person's at, and here's ours."
