I like the idea if Ira as Ari's evil twin.

I started to take the laptop in front of a mirror but the letters are backwards, that don't work.

of course I should have written "but that don't work"

Interestingly, I had no problem reading this, except for the word "was," which is still a word as "saw," and therefore completely derailed my backward-reading train.

I just like that the reverse of "deep" is "peed".

You're in my dreams, too, SEK.  'Also, send me an e-mail.  I've got a new computer, which doesn't remember your e-mail address, and I need to ask you a question.

Scott, is there a deeper meaning to your writing "t'nod" backwards, or is it just a typo?

Outside of "it's not easy to type backwards," there's no more to it Vance.

Me, I'd type _forwards_ but push the left arrow button after each letter.  No problem at all.

I'm also impressed by the million-monkeys-on-typewriter quality of the results.  That backwards sentence I just typed in my previuos comment has not only given me a character name for my next SF story ('Rorrim Selbmeser dilated his front door and stepped into his FlyCar...'); it also managed to put the words 'cum' and 'woh!' in proximity.  You can't ask for more than that.

"previuos" ... see, it's the forward typing that's tricky.

I was "denialpmoc" in the context of relating a dream that threw me.  "When I told him my dream, he said I that only didn't see its obvious meaning because of denial.  And then he mocked me about it.  It was denial'p'moc."
