Further rationalizations follow: his colleagues "would see the
tongue in his cheek" (318); since the book was already in print, he was
"caught ... in the toils of that mysterious engine," such that "if he
had had time to think the matter over, his scruples might have
dragged him back; but his conscience was eased by the futility of
resistance" (318).  His personal disavowals matter less, however, in
light of the fact that he has promised not to reveal his insincerity to
the public.  He "descends" from the ranks of the professional scientist
into those of the professional fraud, since he willingly peddles in
pseudo-scientific nonsense for profit.  It is not of the
earth-shattering variety Darwin described, but a moral descent to which
the title refers.  But it resonates socially, too, via the crass
advertising campaign Harviss orchestrates:
Weeks
in advance the great commander had begun to form his lines of
attack. Allusions to the remarkable significance of the coming work had
appeared first in the scientific and literary reviews, spreading thence
to the supplements of the daily journals. Not a moment passed without a
quickening touch to the public consciousness: seventy millions of
people were forced to remember at least once a   day that Professor
Linyard's book was on the verge of appearing.  Slips emblazoned with
the question:  _Have you read "The Vital Thing"?_
fell from the pages of popular novels and whitened the floors of
crowded street-cars. The query, in large lettering, assaulted the
traveler at the railway bookstall, confronted him on the walls of
"elevated" stations, and seemed, in its ascending scale, about to
supplant the interrogations as to soap and stove-polish which animate
our rural scenery.

Given
the title, the language of ascent here is telling: the newly elevated
stations as one sign of debased modernity; the billboards destroying
the same scenic views which initially inspired Linyard (in the
indirectly roundabout way Nature does in American literature) another. 
To the writer of _The Decoration of Houses_ (1897) and _Italian Villas and Their Gardens_ (1904),
these intrusions of crass modern and marketing culture into city and
country alike suggest that "ascent" carries as much ironic heft as its
obverse here.  Linyard's descent is enabled by the ascent of an
unaesthetic modernity, one more concerned with money than the taste
with which is it spent, with moving from one place to another than the
landscape traveled over.  The cumulative effect of this unthinking is
vitiating.

Under the handling of the first reviewer, _The Vital Thing_'s
"emancipated fallacies ... [were] made up admirably as truths, and
their author began to understand
Harviss's regret that they should be used for any less profitable
purpose" (319).  The first reviewer "set the pace," the others
followed, "finding it easier to let their critical man-of-all-work play
a
variation on the first reviewer's theme than to secure an expert to
'do' the book afresh" (319).  In a culture in which thinking what
everyone else thinks matters more than the thought itself—a fitting
description of both the high culture from which Wharton's heroines flee
and the low in which they threaten to (and occasionally do) fall—garish
advertising and uninformed reviewing mark the decline (or descent, or
devolution) of two important intellectual functions.  

Advertising is a more evolved form of taste, the spokesperson
playing proxy for those whose tastes could formerly only be known
through personal acquaintance.  Similarly, the slips placed in popular
novels are the materialization of so many whispered _did-you-see-what-she-was-wearing_s and _did-you-see-whom-he-arrived-with_s. 
 The newspaper reviewers, obviously, are debasements of the
intellectuals whose opinions once made or broke a book.  In an earlier
story, "[The Pelican](http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=WhaPeli.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=1&division=div1),"
the same descent is traced, although there it concerns the lecture
circuit.  The brilliance of Emerson gives way to "the art of
transposing second-hand ideas into first-hand emotions" (81).  Soon,
however, the audiences tire of emotional recitals about familiar
subjects, and it becomes 
the fashion to be
interested in things that one hadn't always known about—natural
selection, animal magnetism, sociology, and comparative folk-lore;
while, in literature, the demand had become equally difficult to meet,
since Matthew Arnold had introduced the habit of studying the
"influence" of one author on another.  [Mrs. Amyot] had tried lecturing
on influences, and had done very well as long
as the public was satisfied with the tracing of such obvious influences
as that of Turner on Ruskin, of Schiller on Goethe, of Shakespeare on
the English drama; but such investigations had soon lost all charm for
her too-sophisticated audiences, who now demanded either that the
influence or the influenced should be absolutely unknown, or that there
should be no perceptible connection between the two. The zest of the
performance lay in the measure of ingenuity with which the lecturer
established a relation between two people who had probably never heard
of each other, much less read each other's works.

It's
worth noting that Mrs. Amyot's mother, Irene Astarte Platt, attained
fame for writing a poem entitled "The Fall of Man," for the parallel
between the Fall imagine thus and the descent depicted in this story
share a movement _away_ from knowledge.  The knowledge Lindyard
acquired in the lab—part of an effort to displace religious
authority—is what allows him to write a best-selling work of
pseudo-scientific nonsense.  The Amyot's audience learned, the more
they desired not knowledge, but empty displays of intellection.
