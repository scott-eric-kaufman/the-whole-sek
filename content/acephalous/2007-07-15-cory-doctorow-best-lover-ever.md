## Cory Doctorow: Best Lover Ever?

Reading through my feeds on a lazy Sunday morning, I came across Cory Doctorow's [declaration of love](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/07/15/pocket\_paper\_enginee.html) to Caron Barton's [_Paper Pocket Engineer_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/diesekoschmar-20):

I'm in love with Caron Barton's book The Pocket Paper Engineer, a step-by-step guide to designing and executing pop-up effects with paper.

Doctorow loves "grown-up uses for popups"?  I thought he'd sworn undying devotion to [_Alice in Wonderland_ dishes](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/05/03/alice\_in\_wonderland\_.html); or was it [_The Wombles of Wimbleton Common_](http://www.boingboing.net/2001/08/30/the\_wombles\_of\_wimbl.html)?  I have it all wrong: Doctorow's one and only is [Stinkpad](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/12/08/ubuntu\_for\_nongeeks.html), or maybe [_Transmetropolitan_](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/16/transmetropolitan\_1\_.html).  No, I remember now, his heart belongs to [Podium CoolPads](http://www.boingboing.net/2001/08/24/the\_roadtools\_guys\_s.html) or [waterproof cases for Exilim cameras](http://www.boingboing.net/2003/04/14/waterproof\_cases\_for.html), one or the other, unless you count [The Beastles' _Let It Beast_](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/02/12/new\_album\_of\_beatles.html), [_Quicksilver_](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/30/quicksilver\_better\_t.html), or [_Shrook_ 2.0](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/23/wicked\_rss\_reader\_re.html). 

Pressed to choose, I'm sure [vintage Disney ephemera](http://www.boingboing.net/2003/02/20/disney\_ephemera\_thro.html) would be his true, mad, total squeeze. 

Not that he ever will be, mind you.  Doctorow's a _lover_, not "The Decider."

Without doubt, there's a larger point to be made about exuberant online rhetoric, _Boing Boing_'s
popularity, Doctorow's influence, &c.  It being Sunday and me
having a long slog through minimally edited prose ahead, I'll need you
to tackle that for me.  Speak brilliance, people: I don't want to swipe
second-rate material.

UPDATE: Someone requested the short version of that argument, so
here it is: Doctorow's wandering eye is endemic to blogs as a genre. 
He can't help but have fleeting infatuations with momentarily
indispensable items, because otherwise he wouldn't have anything to
write about.  I'm not saying his enthusiasm isn't genuine; only that
it's structured, in part, by a blog-based mentality.  Is this a good
thing?  Depends.  I'd find it exhausting and expensive—as I did during those unhalcyon BBS days—but
I see Doctorow as a member of the tech-class whose interests and
finances outstrip mine, so I've no doubt he lives a fascinating and
fulfilling life_._

Yes, much better to remain enthused about [just one thing](http://www.waggleroom.com/story/2007/7/15/175926/353).  For 99 times and counting....

Are you calling Cory Doctorow a blogwhore? Or maybe just ...  _fickle_  in his affections? 

You know, Scott, maybe the Internet is just too both/and for you; it is a place for the expression of a plenitude of loves, unfettered by the exclusivity of love in the singular. 

...or maybe Doctorow just likes distracting shiny things. 

PS why does my Bloglines keep updating saying you have 33 or 102 new posts every few hours, but then you don't?

"TC," I don't mind the self-promotion, but you do know, I'll _never_ be a convert, right?  I spent my youth swiping and selling back balls from [The Country Club of Louisiana](http://www.ccofla.com/CCOFLA/home.aspx), which later boasted both Master P and Snoop Dogg as members.  (Didn't swipe from them though, as I ain't stupid.  Although, now that I think about it, I think Snoop would've respected me ganking his balls when he wasn't looking ... so long as the enterprise remained wholly literal, that is.)

Sisyphus, I don't doubt that Doctorow loves shiny things ... and had I the energy and salary, I'd love shiny things too.  But it's odd for such a love to become standard, no?  I'm being flip here only because I don't have time or thought enough to spare on all its implications, but such that it is, my argument would be that the fetishization of sleek stuff is as deleterious as any other, we merely miss it because of Doctorow's activism.  (I should say here that I've exchanged a couple of emails with him, and there's no doubt in my mind as to his commitment ... I only wonder about the effect of his love on his many, many, many, many, many readers.)

As to why I seem to write so much according to Bloglines, well, I don't know.  It doesn't pick up all my drafts, does it?  (_he says, fear visible in his eyes_)

No, no, it's not  _new_  stuff; it will suddenly declare that 33 or 47 posts are new even though I have clicked on them before, and there are no new comments, and nothing at all seems to be changed. Oh well, I'm just crazy. 

And since I usually pile up some quotes and then work backwards to figure out my point, I'll leave some handy quotes for you to spin into gold --- or Doctorow analysis --- yourself:

“In the flâneur the intelligentsia pays a visit to the marketplace, ostensibly to look around, yet in reality to find a buyer” (Walter Benjamin, “Paris, Capital of the Nineteenth Century”)

... ok the Foucault one about desires proliferating as sex is put into discourse isn't coming easily to hand. Have one quote then.

Can't we deploy the analogy to natural selection here too?  It's like the question "How can Roger Ebert stand to keep reviewing movies every week in the same way?"  The answer is, because if he couldn't, we wouldn't have heard of him.  Or maybe this is more like the anthropic principle.

Doctorow's love for commercial ephemera is genuine and thoroughly self-aware. His signature short story was, after all, ["Craphound"](http://craphound.com/?p=140), and his parents are, after all, [academic Trotskyites](http://www.sfrevu.com/ISSUES/2003/0302/Feature%!I(MISSING)nterview%!-(MISSING)%!C(MISSING)ory%!D(MISSING)octorow/Interview.htm). I think he'd agree with us that his idiosyncrasies match peculiarly well with the weblog form and some widespread habits of his online generation. I also think he's had more opportunity to think about what that means than we have, and so it might be worth bringing him into the discussion. My conversations with Cory have often included mutual exasperation, but I've never found him to be thoughtless or inarticulate.

(As a preview of sorts, his view of my enthusiasm for high culture and pre-1950 literature didn't differ much in form from your view of his enthusiasm for plastic junk.)
