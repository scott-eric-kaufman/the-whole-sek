[Tribble](http://chronicle.com/jobs/2005/09/2005090201c.htm) [Redux](http://chronicle.com/jobs/2005/07/2005070801c.htm) could've been the title of this post.  But his bland "restatement" of points he didn't make the first time through has already been deflowered of its strained innocence by [Miram](http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the\_little\_professor/2005/09/more\_tribble\_mo.html), [Collin Brooke](http://wrt-brooke.syr.edu/cgbvb/archives/2005/09/retribbution.html), and [gzombie](http://ghw.wordherders.net/archives/004786.html).  (No doubt others too, but since I'm working from a WiFi that can barely handle the graphics-heavy sites of the [Wordherders](http://wordherders.net/wordherders/), I'll leave the link-whoring to those better outfitted.)

In its stead [![Coppola\_and\_sterling\_037](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/coppola\_and\_sterling\_037.jpg "Coppola\_and\_sterling\_037")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/coppola\_and\_sterling\_037.jpg)I offer this confession: I'm officially a "wine enthusiast."  Like [Paul Giamatti](http://imdb.com/name/nm0316079/) in _[Sideways](http://imdb.com/title/tt0375063/)_, only without the arcane [enological](http://library.smsu.edu/paulevans/Enology/enology3.shtml) chops and impressive command of all things adjectival (after today, however, I may be able to fake it).  So while I could litter this entry with rows and rows of pictuces of rows and rows of grapes (whose roots, interestingly enough, are _at this very moment_ straining to reach the water table, a process known as "I don't remember."  [![Coppola\_and\_sterling\_038](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/coppola\_and\_sterling\_038.jpg "Coppola\_and\_sterling\_038")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/coppola\_and\_sterling\_038.jpg) Or I could continue yesterday's discussion about my fascination with the results of haphazard building practices.  But I'll spare you the first and continue the second only when I have something more interesting to say about it (as opposed to the numerous other examples I thought up today).  Instead I'll talk about my frankly toddler-esque infatuation with machinery and pipes.  It leads me to take pictures like the one you see up there on your left and right.  There's something about the evidence of shiny process that assures me that the world isn't the unwieldy mess it appears to be.  No!  It's an orderly place populated by men in hardhats who work for its betterment.  It is _not_ the world described by Michael Lewis in _[Liar's Poker](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140143459/sixapart-20)_, in which traders
spend far more time plotting strategy than...wondering whether the should do the deals.  They basically assume that anything that enables them to get rich must also be good for the world.  The embodiment of the take-over market is a high-strung, hyperambitious twenty-six-year-old, employed by a large American investment bank, smiling and dialing for companies.

That is _not_ the world I live in.  [](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/safetyfullbrimhardhat.jpg)My world's connected by pipes.  These pipes contain goods manufactured by honest men in hardhats.  These goods are delivered to these pipes by means of ladders and walkways which reverberate under the feet of the heavy work-boots of honest hardhatted men.  This is how my world works.  _This is how my world works_.  I photograph objects which evidence my illusions.  I only thought through this theory today, and it's undoubtedly the product of coincidence: reading _Liar's Poker_ while touring manufacturing plants indulging in my predilection for photographing industrial apparatuses.  

Evidence supporting this theory is thin on the ground.  Thin in the trees.  Thin in the air.  Thin in the world.  _But all over this post_.
