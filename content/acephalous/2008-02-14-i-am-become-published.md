## I Am Become Published

Checked my mailbox for the first time in months today and found five of these stuffed in it:

Now take a gander at the back cover.  Can't see nothing for nothing?  Peer halfway down and squint a bit and you'll see a familiar name (a few in fact):

![image](http://acephalous.typepad.com/100\_3166.JPG)

Y. T., [Dr. B.](http://bitchphd.blogspot.com/), [Holbo](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/), [M.H. Abrams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.\_H.\_Abrams)—you know, the usual suspects.  

(Also want to send a shout-out to fellow Anteater [Susanne Hall](http://susannehall.com/), whose article on the 50th anniversary of Ginsberg's "Howl" is far more substantial than my piddly thing on book events.  Thought I had the award for "Best Essay by an Anteater in Issue 69 of _the minnesota review_" in my pocket.  Turns out I was wrong.)

**UPDATE:** Didn't realize this when I took the pictures, but scan to the right and you'll see _[someone](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/)_ craftily introduced the concept of "product placement" to _Acephalous_.  Point to you, Rauchway!

Congratulations, SEK!  And thanks for the plug, however inadvertent.  (Did you shoplift, it though, that's the question.)

Thanks for the plug for the journal.  Next time I can send you some hi-rez images of the cover (and perhaps an 8x10 of me).

Scott: does your camera have a macro setting? For the love of all that's holy, please use it.

And congrats!

Scott, you're too kind! I really enjoyed reading your essay and learned something from it; I think it will be helpful for folks like me who check in on academic blogs sporadically and who thus haven't developed a coherent sense of their logics and projects. I think we can agree the "Best Essay by an Anteater in Issue 69 of the minnesota review" award ends in a tie, one that can only properly be broken by arm wrestling.

_Scott: does your camera have a macro setting?_

I have absolutely no idea, but given that it's ancient, the answer's "probably not."  

_one that can only properly be broken by arm wrestling_

I'm just gonna go ahead and concede in advance, if that's alright with you.

I prefer to read that as broken-by-arm wrestling. Just as fearsome a thing.

I dunno: my first digital camera, c. 2001, had a macro option...

Congratulations! I'll refrain from zot-zotting.

(But, Scott, my vision is already at c. 20/1200.  Have I done something to you, that you would want to render me permanently blind?!)

Congrats! 

I had an essay in MR #68, and also had strange company -- Noam Chomsky.
