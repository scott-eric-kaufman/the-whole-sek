I know how John [feels](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2004/01/pmla\_the\_good\_t.html) about _PMLA_, but as David Bergeron wrote in _Shakespeare Quarterly_
some years back, it is “the most prestigious unread journal in our
profession.” Being published in it is cause for celebration.  So put
your hands together for my friend Stephen Schryer, whose “Fantasies of
the New Class: The New Criticism, Harvard Sociology, and the Idea of
the University” [.[pdf](http://acephalous.typepad.com/fantasies\_of\_the\_new\_class.pdf)] appears in the latest issue.  (In what is quickly [becoming](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/adam-roberts-la.html) a [refrain](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/09/almost\_famous.html),
I can’t recommend the acknowledgments highly enough.) If you fancy the
abstract, read the article and, if so inclined, comment on it [over [there](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/fantasies\_of\_the\_new\_class/#comments)]. 
Stephen will be [[there](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/fantasies\_of\_the\_new\_class/)] to answer any questions you might have.  

This essay examines the professionalization of United
States literary studies and sociology between the 1930s and 1950s under
the aegis of John Crowe Ransom’s New Criticism and Talcott Parsons’s
structural functionalism. These paradigms pulled the disciplines to
opposite poles of the professional class: Ransom argued for a less
sociological literary criticism, while Parsons distanced sociology from
the literary tendencies of the Chicago school. However, both
implemented similar professional ideologies that synthesized their
disciplines’ technical and moral claims, and both paradigms involved
fantasies that specialized, disciplinary work within the academy can
have a broader, moral significance. These ideas remained fantasies,
which contradicted the actual effects of the New Criticism and
structural functionalism; professionalism became reflexively oriented
toward disciplinary self-perpetuation, isolating literature and
sociology from the public they were supposed to reform. Ransom and
Parsons thus exemplify the disintegration of publicly responsible
professionalism—an event with broad implications for the “new class” of
postwar knowledge workers.

Sorry if that previous comment was tonally ambiguous. It _really is_ an excellent topic. And I've just read the piece straight through - very, very valuable and exactly the sort of work that we need to be doing. Too tired to comment coherently right now, but what this is leading me to think about right now is the way that the fact that basic moves of the New Criticism have remained foundational in the discipline despite the waxing and waning of the various schools that have followed it. (We - at least most of us, I think - end up teaching and writing in modes that resolve into a scientific approach to the literary-ineffable. We can't help but close-read everything straight into the aporia, right?) So what I am wondering about is what this persistent NC that dare not speak its name has to do with our own current sense of ourselves as a class, perhaps as a belated "new class." 

God. That's not very coherent. Sorry - more tomorrow.
