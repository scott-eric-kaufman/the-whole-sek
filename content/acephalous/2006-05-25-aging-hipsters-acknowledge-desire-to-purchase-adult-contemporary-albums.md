## Aging Hipsters Acknowledge Desire to Purchase Adult Contemporary Albums

IRVINE — Aging hipsters nationwide are fighting the urge to purchase two of the hottest new adult contemporary albums.  Both albums—Paul Simon's _Surprise_ and the Dixie Chicks' _Taking the Long Way_—boast producers who have what is called "indie cred."  At the helm of Simon's _Surprise_ is the esteemed 
Brian Peter George St. Baptiste de la Salle Eno.    

With the same deft hand responsible for such influential albums as _[Another Green World](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00022M51I/diesekoschmar-20)_ and [The Microsoft Sound](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1996/06/02/PK70006.DTL), Eno updates Simon's sound for a new generation of listeners.  According to Simon, "I haven't sounded this fresh in since _Graceland_.  I owe that entirely to Brian.  His creepy atmospherics are the perfect counterbalance to my tendency to indulge in musical traditions I'm not altogether familiar with."

At [Amoeba Records](http://www.amoebamusic.com/www.amoebamusic.com2/html/home.htm) in Los Angeles, a man in his late-twenties was seen clutching _Surprise_ to a t-shirt celebrating Pavement's 1994 tour in support of _Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain_.  "I like Brian Eno," he said.  "You going to use my name in this?  'Cause my girlfriend would flip.  But seriously, listen to the 'How Can You Live in the Northeast' or 'Everything About It Is a Love Song' and tell me that's not classic Eno."

"They should have started collaborating in the Seventies," said another Amoeba patron.  "The lyrics even have that corny Seventies environmentalist thing going on.  I can almost see that [indian tear up](http://www.retrojunk.com/details\_commercial/499/) when I listen to it."

The same cannot be said for the new Dixie Chicks album.  "The Seventies?" asked one of the legion of [Atrios](http://atrios.blogspot.com/) readers who pre-purchased the album.  "More like the mid-Nineties.  They brought in members of Semisonic, the Jayhawks, and got Rick Rubin to produce.  So long as they hate Bush and it don't sound like the Dixie Chicks, it'll be awesome."

Rubin has acquired a reputation for transforming marginal acts into popular crossover sensations.  He has worked with everyone from L.L. Cool J., the Beastie Boys, Rage Against the Machine, System of a Down, Johnny Cash, Weezer and the Mars Volta.  He decided to work with the Dixie Chicks for the challenge.  

"People thought I wouldn't be able to re-mainstream Neil Diamond, but you've seen [_Saving Silverman_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0239948/), right?  Have you heard Johnny Cash's '[Hurt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQECQOSBrPY)'?  Has anyone ever covered a song better?  Have you ever seen a better video?  People expect me to perform miracles."  

According to that guy over there in the beaten Chuck Taylors and fashionably weathered jeans, he just may have succeeded.  "You can actually hear Gary Louris on four of the songs.  And the harmonies are sort of pretty sometimes.  What's this in my hand you ask?  The latest TV on the Radio album.  Heard of them?  Didn't think so.  I'm still cool.  Stop laughing."  

Gary Louris does sing harmony on "Everybody Knows."  Given Rubin's penchant for trenchant covers, one would expect it to be a cover of Leonard Cohen's immortal "Everybody Knows."  Or Concrete Blonde's incredible cover of Cohen's tune from _Pump Up the Volume_.  

"People would think that.  But I'm all about defying expectations.  Look at who's buying _Taking the Long Way_," said Rubin, who initially wanted the album named _The Long Cut_.

I had written off Simon after the last few mediocre (though not bad) albums, but I heard his latest at Border's, and I was impressed.  It's on my "Maybe buy someday on sale" list.

My honest appraisal?  It's a sonically interesting album, but Eno's been there a thousand times before.  Simon's lyrics?  They haven't been worth the price of admission in some time, but he's still clever enough on occasion.  (All occasions on this album, however, are strictly of the "GRANDPA DOESN'T UNDERSTAND CELL-PHONES!" variety.  What makes it worth it buying is how seamlessly Simon and Eno work together, and how well each of their established styles complements the other.  I joke above, but had these two hooked up in the '70s, who knows what could've happened.

(Ahem!)

Young man, "aging hipster" and "late twenties" do not belong in the same sentence - unless, of course, suitable quotation marks are provided.  Unironic aging hipsters would be the bikers I knew in Denmark: the cyclone of history picked them up in 1968 and regurgitated them untouched at the ByFest in 1996.

You know, after hearing two or three selections from Paul Simon's newest album on an NPR interview/broadcast, I can honestly say that there are some places he shouldn't go... and this is one of those places. While I have a soft spot for the Eno/Lanois-esque sound, it's just wrong for Paul Simon. ("Wartime Prayers" is nothing less than embarrasingly sophomoric; the sincerity is surprisingly suffocating, and the music boring.) Have his merry percussionists abandonated him altogether? Is he now "become Green Day"?

Sigh.
