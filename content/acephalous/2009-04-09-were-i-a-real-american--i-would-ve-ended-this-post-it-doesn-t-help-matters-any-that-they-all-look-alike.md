## Were I a “Real American,” I would’ve ended this post “It doesn’t help matters any that they all look alike.”

Via [_PostBourgie_](http://postbourgie.com/2009/04/09/of-easy-names-and-idiocy/), I learn that Texas State Representative Betty Brown thinks Asian-Americans should [adopt names](http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6365320.html)
“easier for Americans to deal with.” When called out on this, a
spokesperson compounded Rep. Brown’s idiocy by saying “her comments
were only an attempt to overcome problems with identifying Asian names
for voting purposes.” 

Problem the first: if people vote in American elections, _they’re Americans_,
so the notion that they ought to adopt names “easier for Americans to
deal with” entails a definition of “American” that excludes “American
citizens.” These citizens are Americans who “deal with” their names
dandily, so Rep. Brown’s statement makes no sense on its face—unless
you assume that she _means_ to exclude certain American
citizens from her definition of “American.” Had she been a little
clearer, this confusion could’ve been avoided. All she needed to say is
that Asian-Americans should adopt names “easier for _Real Americans_ to deal with” and no one would’ve batted an eye at the remarks by the racist old white woman from Texas.

Problem the second: I teach at a school where [more than half of the students](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/02/19/where-i-am-i-dont-know-ill-never-know-in-the-silence-you-dont-know-you-must-go-on-i-cant-go-on/)
are of East or Southeast Asian descent, and let me tell you: I have
never had a class that wasn’t stuffed full of Jennifers and Jessicas.
Why? 

I’m not as qualified to speak to this as I would’ve been had LSU not dismantled the linguistics program my senior year (_not that I’m bitter_),
but as I remember it, about half of the Chinese consonants fall
somewhere between what native English speakers would hear as a “j,” so
to native Chinese speakers “Jessica” and “Jennifer” sound more like
actual names. I could expand this out to the voiceless affricative
equivalent of “j,” the English “ch” sound, but suffice to say that if
you think about all the different ways you can pronounce “Beijing,”
you’ll see my point. So it only makes sense that the most common
Chinese-American names have initial consonant sounds that resemble
Chinese phonemes. (I could expand it even further and talk about more
than Chinese, but the same principle applies.) 

All of which is only to say that if the Asian-American community
wants to make it easier for “Real Americans to deal with” them, they
don’t need to simplify their names so much as make them more complex.
One quarter I had three students in a class or twenty-three named
“Jennifer Hu” and two named “Jessica Quan.” Not that I count as a “Real
American,” mind you, but if I did I wouldn’t be advocating for _less_ variety in Asian-American names but _much more_.

[Beijing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_GE4dkpOdPw): there really is a right pronunciation. (I'm not saying that I use it myself, mind you)

Didn't many of the white ethnics of the last great immigration wave change their names to become "more" American?  Are they still stewing over the horrible injustice of it all?

Instead of "real" perhaps she should have used "other".

Fritz, I think the whole, "They simplified our name at Ellis Island" thing is something of an urban myth.  The staff at EI actually had translators for the languages of pretty much everyone coming in on hand.

I'm not an American at all, ""Real" or otherwise, so excuse me for wondering why you don't count as a "Real American". Are you a Resident Alien or something?

_Beijing: there really is a right pronunciation._

But it depends on what variation of Chinese is spoken.  I mean, how do people from Boston say "Boston" vs. how Californians say "Boston"?

_Didn't many of the white ethnics of the last great immigration wave change their names to become "more" American? Are they still stewing over the horrible injustice of it all?_

There's a bit of a difference: when my grandparents came through Ellis Island, they Americanized their names _at_ Ellis Island.  Rep. Brown is talking about naturalized citizens with what, to her ears, are "funny names."  They're not fresh off the boat.  Put differently: what if a Texas legislator from "[Texas Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas\_German)" said what Rep. Brown did, only about German-surnamed citizens whose parents fought for the US in WWII?  

_The staff at EI actually had translators for the languages of pretty much everyone coming in on hand._

But they weren't all available all the time, so many, many wacky transliterations made it off the island.  My relatives were Yiddish speakers who were processed by a French specialist who knew a little German of the Austrian sort.  Hilarity ensued.

_I'm not an American at all, ""Real" or otherwise, so excuse me for wondering why you don't count as a "Real American". Are you a Resident Alien or something?_

That was me being coy: as a Jew, there are a lot of people (especially around Rep. Brown's neck of the woods) who wouldn't consider me a "Real American," because "Real Americans" love Jesus, like the Founding Fathers!  (Many of whom, of course, did nothing of the sort, but we're rewriting history here!  Who has time to look up inconvenient facts!)

Jewish names also got changed before the Jews in question got to Ellis Island: one set of my Ukrainian ancestors went through three names in the space of a week-and-a-half, winding up as "Wilson" after they hit Ellis Island.  (They started out with a lot more consonants.)   But, yeah, a lot of Jews also deliberately altered their names to something vaguely more WASPish.  My grandmother's family, the Meyrowitzes, all changed their names to Rowe when the sons enlisted during WWII.  Jews also changed their first names all the time, like my great-great uncle Jack (originally Yitzchak) or, for a two-fer, my cousin Harry Fink (originally Hersch Finkelstein).

Try professing a belief in the primacy of the bishop of Rome.  Or refuse to [take oaths](http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=310&page=586/).  Or live in a [closed religious community](http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=406&invol=205/).  Or [marry multiple wives, just like the Patriarchs](http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=98&page=145/).  Or use [certain substances to heighten your spiritual awareness](http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=494&page=872/).  Those don't earn you many favors, Jesus of no.
