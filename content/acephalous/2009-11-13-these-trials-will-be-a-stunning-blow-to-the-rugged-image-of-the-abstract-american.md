## "These trials will be a stunning blow to the rugged image of the abstract American."

Until [recently](http://www.google.com/search?q=%!t(MISSING)ransnational+left%!)(MISSING),
the phrase "transnational Left" only appeared in print every once in a
while (and then only in articles that also granted the existence of
global Jewish banking conspiracies). Lately, it seems impossible to
read an article by a mainstream conservative that doesn't assume Obama
is a figurehead for this amorphous child of the First International.
For example, the very serious [
Blane McDonnagh
](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091790/) Andrew McCarthy [argues](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTVkN2ZhMTU0NzcwYWVmYTNmODI1ZTJjMTA1ZDFiODQ=) that Obama's decision to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in accordance with the laws of the land
will
provide endless fodder for the transnational Left to press its case
that actions taken in America's defense are violations of international
law that must be addressed by foreign courts. And the intelligence
bounty will make our enemies more efficient at killing us.Obama
and Holder are not trying to reestablish the rule of law, they are
engaged in a game of political chicken with their real constituents
(the transnational Left) and, because they blinked, they owe a tribute
of American lives to their overseas masters. The problem with such
paranoid stylings is that 1) Mohammed and his compatriots were tortured
and 2) the entire world already knows that. What can these men say 
against the United States
 that hasn't already been published by international news syndicates?  

These
trials will not be a farce intended to give the bogeyman that is the
transnational Left the leverage it needs to prosecute the previous
administration. Former Presidents are only kidnapped and tried overseas
in spy novels and Chile, and I doubt conservatives want their icons
compared to Pinochet. Central to this deluded argument is the notion
that the current administration would prosecute these terrorists for
reasons [other than being terrorists](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-to-stand-trial.html):  
[T]he
great hope of the terror-backing neo-communist left, at home and
worldwide, is that the Obama administration will continue to build a
case for torture trials for former Bush administration officials.Suffice it to say that when a professor of political science conflates American liberals and
 most of the rest of the world
 with communist revolutionaries, he should be taken 
very seriously
,
especially when said professor happens to be "an umatched competitor
whose tactical elan would make Machiavelli proud." Because a political
science professor who compares himself to the colloquial mascot\* for
the scorched earth method of maintaining political power is exactly the
sort of person who would 
never

argue in bad faith were it expedient ... except when the professor in
question is Donald Douglas, in which case it's best to assume he's a
tendentious braggart.  

Simply put, there is no singular
"terror-backing neo-communist left" that the administration seeks to
appease with these trials, and those who claims otherwise are being
disingenuous in the service of a small-minded version of what
constitutes "American interests." Rehabilitating our reputation as a
just arbiter in world affairs might compromise the masculinity of the
American brand, but it'll also make the world a safer place for living,
breathing Americans.  

\*Machiavelli was a far more interesting
figure than his contemporary caricature would suggest. See the section
on authorial duplicity and 
The Prince 
in Gale Carrithers and James Hardy's 
Milton and the Hermeneutic Journey 
for more on that.

I think one may have to actually give some "credit" to  Steven Den Beste and his "USS Clueless" (I am not making this up) essays of such length during 2002-3; he had a great influence on the rightwing blogosphere in his theorizing, however chowderheaded, and he got a lot of discussion on those blogs with his maunderings about the "transnational left" back then.

Wait, his actual push was for "transnational progressivism," fwiw.  Same thing, though.

_Former Presidents are only kidnapped and tried overseas in spy novels and Chile_

No, sometimes we invade with a medium-sized strike force, blast them with horrific music until they surrender, then arrest and try them in our country. 

_Simply put, there is no singular "terror-backing neo-communist left" ..._

No, we are multitudes, in their eyes; all of us contributing our teaspoon of sand to the great dune that will overwhelm the Great Wall of civilization.

A member of the transnational Left would deny the existence of the transnational Left, so you have only proved its existence.
