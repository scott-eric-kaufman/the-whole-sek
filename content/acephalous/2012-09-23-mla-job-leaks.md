*   We believe access to the jobs list should be available to all prospective faculty members, not just those with financial means.
*   We believe that a policy that publishes the list “openly” onlyoccasionally, and gives full access to others who pay, isn’t reallyopen.
*   We believe that the profession is better served by being transparent and accessible.
*   We believe that if other professional academic organizations candistribute their lists freely, than so can the MLA. (The MLA should be a
 leader, not a follower.) (American Historical Association and AmericanMathematical Society are both free.)
*   We believe that a policy which requires individuals to choosebetween paying and restricted access hurts the most disadvantaged of our
 community.
*   We believe that all those who are part of the MLA community shouldhelp address this problem and distribute the job list, however andwhenever possible.
