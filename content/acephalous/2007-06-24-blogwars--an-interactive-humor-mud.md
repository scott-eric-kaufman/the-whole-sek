You see scorched earth, battered egos, hurt feelings and hear the unmistakable whine of the dissertator.  The earth, though scorched, shows signs of heavy travel.  At your feet is a book with as many _Post-Its_ as dog's ears.

You are surprised to see the book skip lightly over the surface of the Sea of Faith to your West, before eventually sinking. Now where did that come from?

Shore of the Sea of Faith

The water looks warm and inviting. The beach is a slippery slope.

To the west is the Waters of Lethe. To the North is a rocky path. To the South is an Intelligent Designer.

Intelligent Designer

You are at the feet of the Intelligent Designer.  You think he's God, but really he could be anything--time-traveling biologists, aliens, even a flying spaghetti monster.

To the West is the Waters of Lethe.  To the North is the Shore.  To the East is the Ivory Tower.  To the South are the Cliffs of Insanity.

You kick the dread B'ehe.  He screams an indecipherable order in the prelapsarian tongue.  The Missing Link answers his summons.

You [kill](http://deadlink) The Missing Link.  Three more rise to take its place.  If only you still had your Darwin.

You dive into the Sea of Faith, but you find it impossible to plumb into its brackish depths.  Some mysterious force keeps you afloat, almost as if He does not want you to recover your Darwin.
