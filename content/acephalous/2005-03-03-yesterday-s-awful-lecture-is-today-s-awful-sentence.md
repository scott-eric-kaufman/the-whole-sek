## Yesterday's Awful Lecture is Today's Awful Sentence

So I didn't attend this lecture, thus can't personally speak to its quality, but look at this monstrosity which heads its mass-mailing:

_"Deuber-Mankowsky's lecture exploes Agamben's fascination with a kind of philosophical thinking that controls the power decisive of existence."_

Methinks whoever wrote that header spends most of his or her time reading German.  I'm sure "the power decisive of existence" is a single German word, Energientscheidendbestehen or somesuch.  Not to mention the theoretically-grand-thus-typically-vague claim that the Energientscheidendbestehen is controlled by "a kind of philosophical thinking."   What kind?  "A kind."  Isn't it comforting to know our great minds--the sub-title of the talk identified Agamben as a "Master Thinker"--think so precisely about the Powerdecisiveofexistence?\*

\*I tried to find an adjective to describe what comes after a colon in a sentence, but apparently "colic" and "colonic" are otherwise occupied.  Interestingly enough though, in 1616 Bullokar defined "colon" in a manner that still resonates (at least for those of us who spend our lives frustrated by the pissing-contest in which all academics must micturate): "A marke of a sentence which is made with two prickes."  Thank you.  I'll be here all week.
