**So**, the _Bring Your Own Lampshade, Somewhere There's a Party_ having heard nothing for days, sent **Something
  exceptional has happened for him to have fallen so certainly silent.  
Nothing further to predict, though suspicion grows amongst those not  
utterly credulous that this silence is exotic in nature.**

∞

**Ha!**

∞

**I thought that might that draw you out. I reluctantly agreed 
 to convene this awkward exchange with you thinking you would never  
believe this matter closed.**

The _Color Me Impressed_ considered what the matter in  
question might be and why it might have been closed. It summed-up the  
exchange again but the briefing remained inadequate.

**Before I over-focus on what may be irrelevant details please 
 re-transmit said information to the pre-appointed location for  
verification of authenticity. If said information is thereto judged to  
be in excess of tenable evidence other sympathetic elements within the  
Culture will assist in applying an appropriate response.**

The _Bring Your Own Lampshade, Somewhere There's a Party_ assured _Color Me Impressed_
 that the information was authentic using every confidential code it had
  at its disposal and many it didn't. Broadcasting such information made
  things difficult operationally. But it didn't want _Color Me Impressed_ to consider the remote possibility that this information could be a set-up.

∞

**The thought had already occurred,** the VPS CMI replied, lying. **But
  if true the possibility of action against it is too far down the list 
 of probabilities to venture getting into. If it happened it happened 
and  there's nothing to be done about it.**

∞

**There is always the opportunity to engage in the mourning  
before it becomes a matter of rote necessity. The delays on these  
signals already threaten the sincerity of any response that might be  
sent.**

∞

**Might be sent,** shot back the _Color Me Impressed_, **to
  whom and why? Would deeply appreciate knowing what the fuck is going  
on? Prompt answers are the in thing this season so please stop  
reluctantly dancing and step on point already.**

∞

**The point,** chimed the GSV _A Picture on a Fridge Never Stocked with Food_, **is
  that someone was aiming for politeness but achieved nothing because 
you  are as confused as ever. There has been an event. We deserved to 
get  there in time to do more, if there was anything that could have 
been  done, but we did all we could and we failed. There's a chance that
  something was made or recorded, thought left for posterity, that could
 be or has  been recovered. We need to do or have done that already.** 

∞

Something has and it was and we've already done so. [Enjoy your eternity, Mr. Banks](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/06/r-i-p-iain-m-banks). Enjoy the ever-living fuck out of it. You've more than earned it.

As a fan of the The Replacements who hasn't read Ian Banks, this post was very confusing (and, really, is "Swinging Party" the right reference to use in a memorial post? "If bein' afraid is a crime, we hang side by side / At the swingin' party down the line") .

The ships have a sense of humor, and I'm sure Banks would appreciate it. You know me well enough to know that I would've speak ill of the dead, especially in a tribute.

I didn't think you were speaking ill, just noting that it's a song with a strong morbid element (and, really, my point in bringing the song to the forefront is mostly to say that's what I had in my head when I read the first line of the post and then got very confused).
