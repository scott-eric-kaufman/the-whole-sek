On this day
in history, two men—one of whom would say that the other’s life work
represented “the utmost human degradation[:] an idiot’s vegetative
existence”—were born. In 1885, the author of that statement, Marxist
literary critic Georg Lukács, dewombed in Budapest. Often cited as the
founder of Western (or philosophical) Marxism, Lukács can be considered
the grandfather of the armchair academic activists who fought the
radical fight from tenured positions at illustrious institutions. I
only half-kid here: his claim in _The Historical Novel_ (1937) that the role of the literary critic was to examine “the relation between ideology (in the sense of _Weltanschauung_) and artistic creation” ([147](http://books.google.com/books?id=-\_DoAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=))
allowed otherwise sedentary scholars to label as revolutionary action
an exegesis on Dickensian realism.  Anyone whose work analyzed critical
or socialist realism, _i.e._ literature which displayed “the
contradictions within society and within the individual context of a
dialectical unity,” could consider him or herself a soldier in the
Great Class War Against Mystification. Like [Susan Sontag](http://books.google.com/books?id=e3qgRrVlEH4C&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=#PPA88,M1),
I find his definition of realism—socialist, critical or
otherwise—unnecessarily reductive and his dismissiveness of non-realist
works short-sighted (if not out-right anti-intellectual).

In 1906, the same year Lukács received his Ph.D., was born the man
whose work depicted “an idiot’s vegetative existence.” That Samuel
Beckett’s novels, plays and poetry trafficked in “human degradation”
was reason enough for condemnation: unlike realists novels, which were
capable of creating dialectical conversations between singular
narratives and the social totality of history, modernist novels
wallowed in the singularity of their narrators:

Lack of objectivity in the description of the outer
world finds its complement in the reduction of reality to a nightmare.
Beckett’s _Molloy_ is perhaps the _ne plus ultra_ of this development. ([152](http://books.google.com/books?id=UrCln8TYJMEC&pg=PA152&dq=))

If an author grounds that nightmare in “the Aristotelian concept of man as _zoon politikon_” ([151](http://books.google.com/books?id=UrCln8TYJMEC&pg=PA151));
that is, if an author provides a reference against which the
consequences of the actions of social animals can be judged: only then
can reader or critic differentiate between the concrete potentialities
(what happens) and the abstract potentialities (what the character
thought could have happened). Authors who refuse to declare what
happened—who mess in the pseudo-realization of abstract
potentiality—create readers who will never know from dialectical. They
will not be social animals critically examining the societal
structuring of their lives through the power of realist narratives;
they will be unwitting dupes forever mired in the pathological
subjectivity of Molloy, [forever sucking pebbles](http://books.google.com/books?id=sglVtT7\_nH4C&pg=PP1&dq=molloy&ei=f9bjScibOIGUkASSucWcDQ&client=firefox-a#PPA93,M1). Their lives, such that they are, will be spent in the Grand Hotel Abyss, which Lukács describes as

a beautiful hotel, equipped with every comfort, on the
edge of an abyss, of nothingness, of absurdity. And the daily
contemplation of the abyss between excellent meals or artistic
entertainments, can only heighten the enjoyment of the subtle comforts
offered. (qtd. [22](http://books.google.com/books?id=Qa75D2dtiz0C&pg=PA22))

Needless to say, I disagree.

I’ll close on an historical odditiy: not only was Lukács born on
April 13th, so too was the French psychoanalyst and psychoanalytic
theorist, Jacques Lacan. It’s as if the day conspired to give birth to
the thought of Louis Althusser (which, as you can probably guess, is
one part Lukácian, one part Lacanian and three cans of crazy).

The Grand Hotel Abyss sounds pretty good, actually.  What's supposed to be the problem with it?

It doesn't Help The Cause, Rich.  But now that I think about it, it sounds like a place folks from Iain Banks's novels would frequent, doesn't it?

That was one thing that Banks was refreshingly good at -- the recognition that the working class is full of people who are working for more than grim existence, that people would actually like subtle comforts and excellent entertainments if they were available to everyone.

[Bread and Roses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread\_and\_Roses), you know.  Although the advance of the anti-work anarcho-socialists has been to eliminate that line "No more the drudge and idler, ten that toil where one reposes", which annoyed me from the first time I heard it.  The point is not to put the one idler while nine other people are working to work.  Distributional issues aside, that only gets you 1/10 better production, and really, why bother.  The point is to make it so that nine people can be idle while the one person who really wants to work for some reason can work so productively that he or she can support all of them.

You know I love requests.  Which bit do you want more of?  I can prattle on (semi-accurately) about most of it, and am polite enough to provide citations for ease of refutation.  [_In the best interests of everyone, the extended bit about Eazy-E has been removed from this comment.  For the record, though, it had something to do with why SEK wore his knowledge like that, **i.e.** for easy access. ---The Management_]  That said I'm no [secret Lacanian](http://www.jbj.wordherders.net/2009/04/13/graff-curricular-mixed-messages-in-english-depts/): I know my stuff as well as the bottom 10%!o(MISSING)f UCI graduates, so I'm more than happy to expound as responsibly as I can on whatever it is you found most interesting.

History's important, nk.  That said, you should see the list of important physicists I don't know squat about . . .

If you have not read Bulgakov's "The Master and Margarita" yet, I recommend the Pevar/Volokhonsky translation.

Why do you disagree with Lukács on Beckett? Why is Althusser one part Lukácian, one part Lacanian and three cans of crazy?

Consider your request granted . . . but it won't be posted for a couple of days.  Pretend I'm Amazon and you don't have Prime: place your order, receive it in three to five business days.
