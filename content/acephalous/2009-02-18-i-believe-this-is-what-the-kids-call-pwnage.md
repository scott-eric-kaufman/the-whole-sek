This morning I received an email from one of those Literature Now, Literature Tomorrow, Literature Forever! folks.  Read something like this:

You only post about comic books and films because you're incapable of writing about Real Literature.  That you post obsessively about cultural detritus is proof that you're unconsciously aware of your inadequacy and are compensating.  But no number of close-readings of mediocre popular fare will convince you or prove to anyone else that you have the chops to analyze Real Literature.  _You would never slather such attention on a poem because it is beyond your meager skill_.  

I wouldn't?  [Pwned](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/closereading\_ex.html).  [_Double_-pwned](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/closereading\_ex\_1.html).  [**_Triple_**-pwned](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/closereading\_ex\_2.html).  [
_**Quadruple**_
-pwned](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/being\_the\_third.html).  [
_**WORD-FOR-FIVE**_
-pwned](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/closereading\_ex\_3.html).  

I feel better now.

I hope that's not a paraphrase of _my_ email!

Nope.  It's not even entirely a paraphrase.  That italicized sentence is untouched.  (I'm still replying to your email, but now I have to delete the first bit: "It's odd having this kind of conversation via email.  What!?!  I'm writing for an audience of one!?!")

Good! And I wouldn't mind discussing what we were discussing in front of a larger audience, like the handfuls of readers here.

But "Oh Don A Grecian Urn" is that TV show where people wear silly things on their heads, isn't it?  Cultural detritus, I'd say.

And with this item posted thrice, your correspondent is pwned fifteen times. Had you only thought to post it to the Valve and the EOTAW, you might have pwned him 45 times. (Suddenly thinking about the Haggadah...)

I think I'll just do Literature Now, because, you know, they help literature now.

There you go again, wasting time on some punk romantic "poet."
