So here's the deal: I can't be important unless I have a whole lot more traffic.  People keep telling me this.  It must be true.  So I beg of you, please immediately forward the following email to everyone in your address book:
Dear My Dear Friends,

You must understand that I would not send this email unless I had good reason, and as you have known me for a very long time you know I am not someone who sends emails like this without good reason.  My good reason today is my friend I met over The Internet who has a name and it is Acephalous.  He is a nice boy who had cancer and got hit by a car but now he has no head and it is very serious and it does not look like he will make it without YOUR HELP.  

Bill Gates who is a GREAT MAN sent him an email and in it he wrote that if ONE MILLION people clicked on the site of Acephalous that he would buy him a new head made of computers and parts so he can live a good life again.  So please click on [THIS LINK](http://acephalous.typepad.com/) as hard as you can and pray all the time every day and then forward this email to everyone in your address book and maybe you can help a suffering young little child to have a new computer parts head to replace the one he lost to cancer and being hit by the car and pain.

'Gads, people, this is _a joke_.  No need to leave comments about my "oblivious [_sic_?] self-importance."  Seriously, if I were self-important, I'd self-importantly own up to it.  Since you're just one of Gen. J.C. Christian's minions, however, I'm going to do this blog's equivalent of extraordinary rendition and delete your comment.

I only have, like, 2 people in my address book, but I get mega-traffic on my blog (I think I'm up to **_6_** unique visitors a day! Yay me!) so can I post a link instead?

Ha! You made me laugh out loud, which has my office mates gathered in a corner whispering amoung themselves and shooting furtive glances in my direction. 

"...buy him a new head made of computers..."  Heh!

You might remember that I'm usually a conservative gadfly but your troubles this past week reminded me that there are other aspects of blogging life that create connections rather than irrational screaming. My own behavior on the 'Tubes hasn't always been civilized and I'd like to continue to grow as a person first and commentator second.

BTW:Consider having a blog song, maybe a Talking Heads kinda thing called "I'm Just a Pimp for Traffic, Fah!" :-)

Sorry to not reply sooner.  I've been frustrated, _damn it_, as the posts above evidence.  Thanks for all the kind words.  All these expressions of my unimportance, they did drag.

BJTexs, thanks for the bipartisan support.  Laughter's universal, so long as it ain't political.  As for my official blog song, the more I think about it, the more I think it'd have to be by Tom Waits.  I mean, since you never know who'll read it, "[Telephone Call from Istanbul](http://acephalous.typepad.com/14\_Telephone\_Call\_from\_Istanbul.mp3)" is probably my best bet.
