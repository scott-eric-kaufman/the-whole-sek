## Can a Life be Bipolar?

Because mine certainly seems to be of late.  From the heights of [drafting a publishable paper](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/seems\_im\_a\_poor.html), to the [depths of white supremacy](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/refined\_white\_s.html), and now back to the heights, as a paper I proposed has been accepted.  The best part?  The paper _is not about blogging_.  Someone actually wants to hear me talk about my dissertation.  Admittedly, it's from the same recently praised chapter, so there's a chance this is the only decent bit I'll ever write—the highlight of my unspectacular career.  So be it.  If you find yourself at the American Literature Association's Symposium on Literary Naturalism come October, drop by the panel on Darwinism and Evolution in American Literature, where I'll be saying something about this:
**Accelerating Evolution: Social Reform and 
the Baldwin Effect in Jack London’s _The Iron Heel_ and _Before Adam_**

Jack London was branded by 
association the moment Richard Hofstadter’s _Social Darwinism in American Thought_ hit 
the shelves. One of the earliest reviews 
recounted a session of the American Sociological Society devoted to Social 
Darwinism. The reviewer notes that “none 
of [the participants] went in for any such vociferous and belligerent 
discipleship as did Jack London.” Readers of London’s youthful exchanges with his friend Cloudesley Johns 
would consider this association appropriate: a twenty-four year-old London 
declared himself “An Evolutionist, believing in Natural Selection, half 
believing Mathus’ ‘Law of Population,’ and a myriad of other factors thrown in, 
[who] cannot but hail as unavoidable, the Black and the Brown going down before 
the White.” According to William E. 
Cain, this sentence—first published Joan London’s _Jack London and His Times_ (1939) and a 
longtime staple of the London industry—is 
evidence that “London is quick to express his social 
Darwinism.” Such assessments 
overestimate the coherence of evolutionary theory during what Stephen Jay Gould 
has called the “decade of maximal agnosticism and diversity in evolutionary 
theories.” Strictly speaking, social 
Darwinism did not exist. The 
evolutionary zeitgeist is more accurately called “social Spencerianism,” for it 
is the teleological thought of Herbert Spencer, not the radical randomness of 
Darwinian natural selection, which informs the politics and literature of the 
period. Absent from most accounts is the 
teleology inherent in Spencer’s dictum that development marches from the 
homogeneous to the heterogeneous.  

In 
“Telic Action and Collective Stupidity” (1902), London describes how “the individual is capable 
of, and does perform, telic actions—that is, adjusts his acts to remote ends; a 
thing which society never does.” He 
laments the stupidity of the crowd, here functioning metonymically for society 
at large, which despite being composed of individuals capable of telic action, 
_en masse_ behave as if such feats of 
foresight are impossible. Although he 
posits no solution to this problem, he strikes one optimistic note: it is 
possible for “two or three individuals, or a score, [to] organize a company or 
corporation and collectively perform telic actions.” Telic actions cannot be performed by 
acephalous organizations; democracy is hamstrung by “by the arrant idiocy of 
political organization.” Such actions 
can only be undertaken by undemocratic organizations whose leaders are chosen 
not because they represent society at large, but because they do not. They are superior, and will influence society 
by means of what is called “the Baldwin Effect,” according to which Lamarckian 
inheritance works alongside natural selection in the human population. Great leaders accelerate the teleological 
process London 
believed was already at work: namely, that “from the facts of [human] 
history…the trend of [social] development is toward greater and greater 
collective wisdom.” For him, the 
amelioration of suffering via socialism could not happen soon enough. During this talk, I will demonstrate how 
London’s 
impatience with the pace of evolution compels him to advocate Baldwinian logic 
in the two novels he wrote during 1906, _The Iron Heel_ and _Before Adam_.

Congratulations.

I was told that it's not customary to give a paper when it has been accepted for publication -- that doesn't apply here (yet), but subsequent experience has taught me that when a paper is accepted, there is really _absolutely no danger_ of it appearing within a year.

Thanks, Mike.  Things are looking up ... for now.

Adam, I've never heard that.  I have heard a number of people remark off-hand that this is from their forthcoming book or article.  Stupid academic niceties ... fortunately, I'm only in the sending-it-out stage, so even if it gets accepted, it'll be a good long while before it'll appear in a journal only libraries can afford to buy.

Congrats! Where is said symposium? 

And wasn't an old curse to tell someone "May your life be interesting?" You're certainly making my boring existence look more comfortable. ...If you'd like to get in on some comforting boringness, I have a \_huge\_ stack of finals you can help with...   :)

Adam, so long as I can put "forthcoming" on my CV, I don't care if it takes ten.  (Besides, I have more readers than the average academic journal.  I slap it up here, Google'll notice.  If only I could get it on a hiring committee.)

Sisyphus, the conference is in Long Beach, which is tremendously convenient, being all of twenty minutes away.  All the perks of a big conference _and_ my very own bed.  Can't beat that.

Congratulations!

You really have to complain to someone about the odd auto-linking that you mentioned earlier, though.  I'm used to clicking on links because the author has placed them there to say something about the text, not because they link to vaguely related books on Amazon.

I've seen CV's that list papers that are under review, which I find tacky as a regular practice (there may be specific reasons for it in some cases).  The worst by far was someone who listed the seminar papers he'd written during coursework, with no indication that he was even attempting to publish them.  Soon someone will list cool ideas he had for a paper once.

Actually, I've heard that's a good thing.  It shows a commitment to publication.  Say a department thinks your work is really smart.  If you show that you're actively trying to place it somewhere, they'll trust their own evaluation.  They'll pin the reason it hasn't been accepted on the vagaries of the process.  After all, _they_ would like to see works published in [_insert prestigious journal_].  That's value to putting "out for consideration" on a CV ... or so I've been told.

1) It's fine to give a paper that's out for publication, or even accepted but not published, but it's bad form to give one that's been published. Not horribly bad form, but not recommended, especially if the scenario is one that matters in some way. (Giving a paper you've published, say, at a minor grad conference isn't really a big deal. At MLA, maybe it would be... A job talk should always be work that is currently underway and not published.) 

2) Sometimes people say they don't like the "under review" category. Personally, I do put "under review" papers on my CV. If you haven't been accepted for publication anywhere when you go out for your first job, I definitely think it would be best to list a few papers "under review." 

One thing not to do, probably, is to have a CV category called "Published Papers" that contains _only_ papers that are under review. Call it something else (just "Papers" perhaps...) It does point out the fact that you are currently trying to publish, and gives a sense of what you've been working on... Don't list the journal where it's under review though. If it gets gonged, you don't want to answer the question of the status of your paper at Journal X. (That is, if it gets gonged, a manila envelope and postage will make it under review again instantly...)

As I understand it the Baldwin effect is not Lamarckian in practice, though it looks a lot like Lamarckism. It still works by natural selection, but selection is operating not on the trait in question but the plasticity that allows that trait to emerge.

Congrats.  

You leave the racial comment just lying there.  Was this a theory of racial absorbtion as Skidmore describes for Brazil (with some interesting U.S. connections), or simply of racial supremacy in evolutionary garb?  I trust that in the larger paper you address somehow how London's racial thought fit into the larger crazy quilt of his evolutionary thinking.  (So, society is stupid, but humanity has ever greater collective wisdom? Huh?)

Actually, I only touch on London's racism in the final draft of the chapter.  It had been front and center -- my dissertation started as an examination of race and liberalism in the '30s, and only gradually drifted back to the '00s -- but London's theories on race are unexamined, dull commonplaces.  There's nothing unique about them.  Not that they don't evolve as he matures -- in _The Iron Heel_, written six years after that letter to Johns, he expresses his belief that each of the races will ascend, through socialism, such that they are on equitable terms, evolutionarily and revolutionarily speaking -- but that he doesn't examine them in any great detail until the South Pacific books, which were written much later (and are outside the scope of my project, which focuses on evolutionary thought before the ascent of the eugenics).

OK, I know that this is/was a paper proposal, and I've certainly included elements in some of mine that I knew I wouldn't be able to follow up on, but the "the Black and the Brown going down before the White” line practically jumps off the page/screen and begs for somekind of follow up.  You obviously don't want to do that kind of following up right now (leave the chapter the hell alone, he writes, trying to follow such advice himself), but it does seem potentially worthwhile later on, just because, in the pre-eugenics period, racial thought is considerably more diverse and cross pollinating with a variety of scientific and biblical debates.  If you haven't read it already, I would recommend adding Thomas Skidmore's classic \_Black into White\_ to your eventual reading pile.  Skidmore doesn't have Theodore Roosevelt reporting on Brazilian theories of whitening to a U.S. public until 1914, but I would suspect that there is a more difuse spread of ideas on evolutionary solutions to the race problem in the decades before that.
