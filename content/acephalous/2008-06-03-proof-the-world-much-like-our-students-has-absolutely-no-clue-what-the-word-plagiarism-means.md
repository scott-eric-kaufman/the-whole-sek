[Via](http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23801022-16947,00.html):
McEwan was accused of plagiarism over his 2001 novel _Atonement_
for relying on the diaries of a wartime nurse for descriptions of World
War II hospitals, an allegation that was widely dismissed because
McEwan had clearly attributed that information to its proper source.

To coin a phrase, accurate and transparent citation of source material is that than which something more disprobative cannot be imagined.

More seriously, this is just Bad Journalism 101.  They can't bring themselves to state clearly that anyone is wrong about anything, even a simple matter of fact.  Some say Obama is Muslim; some say otherwise.  Some say McEwan plagiarized; some dismiss this for reasons whose soundness we are contractually forbidden to assess.
