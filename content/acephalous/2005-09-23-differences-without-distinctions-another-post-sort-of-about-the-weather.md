As Summer yields to the inconstant stress of Fall, I want to take a moment to reflect on what I've accomplished and press the muzzle of what I haven't firmly to my temple.  Or maybe I should inhale deeply ... and again ... and again.  Now I feel better.  Crazed but better.  I remind myself that the danger of a [Category 4](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/22/AR2005092200536.html) hurricane with sustained winds of 155 miles per hour differs only terminologically from the danger of a Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 160 miles per hours.  As I begin to hyperventilate I remember that [Rita](http://technorati.com/tags/Rita) is only history's [third strongest hurricane](http://www.cnn.com/2005/WEATHER/09/22/rita/index.html) and then I realize that _I'm still blogging about the weather_.  Of all the things I never thought I'd launch into online permanence, the cliché which launched a thousand pointless conversations topped the list.  Yet observe the depths to which I have so eagerly rappeled.[[1]](#1)  And so I offer Nature the following compromise: I will stop writing about the weather if you promise to stop churning out weather worth writing about.  Deal?

[[1]]() While double-checking that I spelled "rappel" correctly I inadvertantly came across the entry for "rapely," which means "hastily, in haste, quickly."  The chilling irony of the definition certainly offends, but not nearly so much as the selected quotation: "Adam took Gamelyn, And ladde him rapely and anon."  (Even when a footnote flees from [hurricane](http://technorati.com/tags/hurricane) [Katrina](http://technorati.com/tags/katrina) and her horrible sister I still roll some disturbing die.)
