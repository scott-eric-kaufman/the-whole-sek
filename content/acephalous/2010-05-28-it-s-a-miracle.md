Something terrible happened within a ten mile radius of my apartment _and I was in no way involved_!Â  Because I didn't have to go to campus today, I didn't have to deal with [this](http://abclocal.go.com/kfsn/story?section=news/state&id=7468094):

Which led to this:

Which led to this:

[![100528\_md\_big\_rig\_08](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef013482765d47970c-500wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef013482765d47970c-popup)   
 Although I must admit, that's not altogether different from what I normally have to deal with on the way home.
