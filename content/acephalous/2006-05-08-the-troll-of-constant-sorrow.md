You're as bogus, kitschy, lightweight as like an Irving Copi text. Got that, u dirt-f-n byatch? I think you'd be better off at say the nearest Howard Johnson's management training course, you pathetic little fuck, Kawfmann.

Got dat? But get this: you know what caused this sort of collapse of rational progressive politics, even more than ol Papa Marx did?: I suggest (anecdotally, alas) it was LITERATURE, INC.

"family website peppered with "analytic" bloviation?"

Is that analytic as in "analytic philosophy"? Is this guy claiming to be an analytic philosopher?!

Dear God, I was right. This idiot actually thinks he's an analytic philosopher. If he has read Quine he hasn't profited from the experience. GFAD.

timtim: you don't know what the ToS thinks, but you must think  plagiarism, misrepresentation, and lying are acceptable forms of discourse if you hold a spam-bot consisting of some plagiarized misquotes and  invented insults, imitations/defamations, etc. to be some form of valid communication; and I a quite sure the Tos knows a lot more about validity than k-mann does.

You know, it's actually difficult to tell the Troll of Sorrow apart from, well, the Troll of Sorrow in this thread.  Only by virtue of the "novelty," er, _recombination_ of his previous insults can you tell them apart.  And don't you love how he's now calling himself "Dave Steiger"?  Boy, wouldn't it just be great if I wasted an entire morning trying to discover whether that was his _real_ name?  I mean, you know, if that was _other_ real name, a different one from the one I know but scrupulously avoid using so as to avoid any legal entanglement with said person.  Oh, and to follow my own rules:

"anyone want to act macho then ya should have the spine to back it up...and as I told you many a time I am more than willing to knock any one of yr asses out"

"In the J-Edgaropolis of blogs, simply asking for facts, proofs, bare-bones arguments ala Toulmin, say, or bringing up the dreaded L-V-or-F-words (logic, verification, falsification) causes one to be banned from sites and then be awarded the troll sobriquet."

Damn, this thing is rather fun.

I admit much of my blogwriting is done on the fly, spur of the moment stuff and I think you a bit too much of the literattuer to appreciate more noirish, pulp writing.
