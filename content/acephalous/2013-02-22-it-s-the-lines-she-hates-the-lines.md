_It is 1 p.m. SEK will be spending the next five hours in his office  helping STUDENTS revise their essays. At no point will there not be a  line of STUDENTS outside his door._

> **STUDENT #1:** I have a class at 1 p.m. Can I just drop this off, have you comment on it, and pick it up after class?
> 
> **SEK:** I’ll try to have it done by then, but six of your classmates are waiting in line, and I have to get to them first.

> **STUDENT #1:** See you at 2 p.m.

_SEK spends the next hour in conference with the STUDENTS who waited patiently outside his office. It is 2 p.m._

> **STUDENT #1:** I’m here to pick up my paper.
> 
> **SEK:** I’m sorry, I haven’t had a chance to get to it yet. Do you have any more classes today?
> 
> **STUDENT #1:** No.
> 
> **SEK:** So if you can just wait, I’ll get to you as soon as I finish talking with your classmates.
> 
> **STUDENT #1:** I’ll just come back at 3 p.m. See you then.

_SEK spends the next hour in conference with the last of the STUDENTS who waited  patiently outside his office. It is 6 p.m. SEK has just finished what he  thought was his final conference of the day. STUDENT #2 is packing up  her stuff and preparing to leave._

_STUDENT #1 grabs her unmarked essay and storms out of SEK’s office. STUDENT #2,  who hadn’t finished packing up yet, looks as confused as SEK feels._

> **STUDENT #2:** _What the_—

> **SEK:** Your guess is better than mine. You kids don’t make any sense anymore. I just don’t understand—

> **STUDENT #2:** The things we do on your lawn?
> 
> **SEK:** Out!

Reckon it serves you right, man. You had your chance to give her comments on her paper; you blew it mucking around with the people on line. Maybe next time you'll show a little more respect for her schedule.

My sentiments exactly, right down to you saying "on line" instead of "in line." Because you stand _on_ lines, not _in_ them.
