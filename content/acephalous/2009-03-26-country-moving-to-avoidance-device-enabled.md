What's sad is that she won't really get it. Odds are she will think something is wrong with your CD player, but also think you are trying to play a really great song.  

Also, I will respond "smartly" to one of your "wicked smart" posts someday.

Step 1: use one of these every time you hear her talk.   

Step 2: casually mention at some point that you've been having problems with  

cell reception too, planting the suggestion that there's some problem.  

Step 3: at some point, casually mention that the area's become a cell dead-spot  

due to wireless interference from [insert random U.C high tech labby thing].
