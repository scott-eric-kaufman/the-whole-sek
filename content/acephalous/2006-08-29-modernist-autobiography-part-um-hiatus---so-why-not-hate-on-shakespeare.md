## Modernist Autobiography: Part, um, Hiatus ... So Why Not Hate on Shakespeare?

The perils of cross-posting!  I'm going to hold off on publishing the second part of [my exagmination round these factifications for incamination of my work in progress](http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/joyce/images/pr6019-o9-w922\_00001.jpg), lest I appear to hog that most venerable, Valvular platform.  (A Southern boy can only call so much attention to himself before demurring.)  

In the meantime, I present an excerpt from an interview with Frank Kermode I'll discuss at greater length later this week.  (This line of research inspired by the [new interview](http://books.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1860357,00.html) with him in The Guardian.)  This passage addresses why Americans (including Greenblatt) teach Shakespeare terribly:
There is danger which threatens Shakespeare at all times.  The worst of them is a kind of sentimentality, I think.  But we have been bombarded with biographies these days.  There is one in full public attention at the moment, [Stephen] Greenblatt’s [_Will in the World_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/039332737X/diesekoschmar-20), which of course is intelligent but still sentimental, I think.  There is this feeling that you can say almost anything as long as it is rather loving about Shakespeare.  And I have always thought as a teacher, one needs to be able to say that Shakespeare is often a very bad writer.

Kermode sounds innocent enough here, but he says of Greenblatt a bit later:
Well, of course he is an exceedingly clever man, a great ability, great intellectual power, I think.  But sometimes, as I have labored to demonstrate, very often simply wrong.

You should read the terrible things Wittgenstein said about Shakespeare -- that his metaphors were often bad, for instance (W. is the \*king\* of similes) -- OBVIOUSLY he has some anxiety of influence, now doesn't he?  W.'s work must be another attempt to deal with the big nobodaddy -- and his homosexuality.
