## The sort of cultural criticism you notch all the way to the top.

(_Can you guess where this was originally posted?_)

We here at _Lawyers, Guns and Money_ are solidly in the [Roman](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/09/polanski-arrest.html) [Polanski](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/09/polanski-addenda.html) [belongs](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/09/crime-and-punishment.html) [in prison](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/09/one-last-thing.html) camp, but we are also rank pedants, and [the following sentence](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jjena/2010/02/16/hire-me-roman-beautiful-people-gush-over-pedophile-director/) is something up with which we shall not put:
When Franz Kafka wrote “The Metamorphosis” he may have had someone like Roman Polanski in mind.Because Jeffrey Jena is a very serious thinker who "has been seen on _Murder, She Wrote_, _Hunter_, appeared in shows with Jenny McCarthy and Weird Al Yankovic and in several films including _Raising the Dead_
with Allison Eastwood," we must consider the implications of this
literary reference very seriously, as there is no chance he inserted it
solely to make people think he reads important books.  

Jena's
complaint is that, much like Gregor Samsa in Kafka's novel, Roman
Polanski rapes children—only Samsa did nothing of the sort. Let us try
again: Jena's complaint is that, much like Gregor Samsa in Kafka's
novel, Roman Polanski awoke one morning to find himself transformed into _einem ungeheueren Ungeziefer_,
a monstrous vermin—only that would absolve Polanski of moral
responsibility for his crimes, as he had no hand in his transformation
and, more importantly, no one expects monstrous vermin to abide by
human law. Jena's complaint must be that, like Gregor Samsa, Roman
Polanski is not being treated by the Swiss courts in the manner their
American counterparts treated John Wayne Gacy, who murdered
thirty-three people—only that makes no sense _at all_. We are officially stumped. We have no clue what Jena hoped to accomplish by dropping that reference. Unless:  
[Pierce]
Brosnan went on to say that in order to work with Mr. Polanski, “You
have to know your onions.” I am not really sure what that means but it
tells us two things about Mr. Brosnan, he’s not great with metaphors
and he may be a little dense. Brosnan is the poster boy for the term
“limousine liberal.” He claims to have become an American citizen
during what he terms “the atrocity of the Bush years” to help his
family “endure the hypocrisy and stupidity of the man’s power.” His
power is stupid? His power is filled with hypocrisy? How do you figure
that?Of course! Jena was priming the Pump of Irony. Had he
not dropped in a completely random, utterly irrelevant reference in
that first sentence, readers may have breezed over his criticism of
Brosnan without realizing how ironic it is when someone with Jena's
linguistic facility criticizes someone else for mouthing an
infelicitous metaphor. We're not sure whether we should thank him or
file this away with all the other examples of cultural conservatives
whose knowledge of the culture they aim to conserve is as wide and deep
as a playa lake.

Also, it took about two seconds and Google for me to figure out that 'know your onions' means 'to be experienced or knowledgeable about a subject.'  It's origin seems to be as american slang in the roaring twenties.

I like that he doesn't know what "know your onions" means, but can still conclude from it that Brosnan is "dense".

I think it must be a reference to the fact that Samsa was eventually disowned and ignored by his family. Yes. That's what it was.
