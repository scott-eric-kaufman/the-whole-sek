## Yes, I <em>do</em> have a Masters in Self-Victimization. Why do you ask?

The [aforementioned](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/im-nipping-this.html#more) _mensch_ [writes](http://durhamwonderland.blogspot.com/2007/08/credentials.html#comment-6485545753481057809):
Sure, Kaufman _might_ be a master of self-victimizing schemes.  But look at his blog.  Doesn't fit.

Hate to disagree, but a good long gander at this blog strongly indicates otherwise.  Since I began blogging, I've

*   caught students having [sex in my office](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my\_morning.html) and became entangled in a [sexual harassment lawsuit](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my\_morning.html).
*   received death threats from an unstable and [sorrowful](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/the\_troll\_of\_co.html) troll who lives less than an hour away.
*   been [cyber-stalked](http://crookedtimber.org/2007/06/11/blogging-gets-results/) by an insane sports writer from Wisconsin out to ruin my career.
*   been accused of [criminal pettiness](http://www.theoria.ca/theoria/archives/2007/04/the-scott-eric-kaufman-affair.html) for [observing](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/04/on\_the\_impossib.html) someone else's criminal pettiness.
*   had that [other thing](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/04/point\_of\_record.html#comment-65496514) happen in the comments thread of that other blog, which led to [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/04/point\_of\_record.html), among other vile things.

I've brought all this upon myself in _two years_.  I may be the most successful self-victimizer the internet has even seen.  I attract more (absurd) scandal in a week than the average blogger does in the course of his or her entire blogging career.  

I demand credit where it's due.  I've worked hard, damn it, and deserve a cookie.  I want my damn cookie.  I _demand_ a damn cookie.  If _[someone](http://acephalous.typepad.com/)_ don't give me one soon, _someone_ is gonna find himself subscribed to a couple hundred more conservative listservs come morning.

Those were undoubtedly the top four, but the mid-range has some of the less-threatening and therefore more-amusing ones. How could you neglect the insanity that was J\*hn Br\*ce?  Or the Craig counterfeit cache counter-accusation calumny?  Does having someone sign you up for 80 Email lists even make the top ten?

You know, I knew I was forgetting a few.  The Craig thing certainly warrants mention, but I'm not sure about Bruce.  I was collateral damage in that one, mostly.

[And I added a link to the ridiculous "c[C]raig" affair.  'Gads, I must've repressed that idiocy on purpose.  Looking back through it, really, the boy's a pathetic hoot.]

Well, following those links cost me an hour that I'll never get back... but then, _dang_, my life is never quite so, um, interesting.  So I'm okay with vicarious.

No, no, I'm not starting anything back up.  Merely pointing out that I'm a magnet -- somehow _intentionally_, in all likelihood -- for online absurdity.  I mean, really, I've been involved in four of the most bizarre extremely-minor-and-unimportant-internet-related "scandals."  I have _talent_, damn it, and I won't let you say otherwise.

I'm special, see?  _I'm special I'm special I'm special!_

Also, I'd like to thank AMac for those cookies.  _However_, I demanded home-made.  Just because he didn't know that, doesn't mean I can't condemn him.

And here I am, condemning him.

_Home-made!  I demand the equivalent of Mama's love (in cookie)!_

So, are all these kerfuffles (or whatever the appropriate word might be) an unconscious desire to create a crisis as propellant to finish the dissertation, or an unconscious desire to avoid finishing the dissertation and remain a grad student forever?

Cause they do tend to cluster around "dammit I'm trying to finish a chapter in a couple days" statements.

(Unless the crises are happening constantly and I've missed most of them?)

Don't forget that just days ago you were a racist. I was telling my wife that story, and then we wound up talking about how all of my stories that begin, "You won't believe what's happening to this blogger I read ...." turn out to be about you, and include five minutes of, "You remember him, from the story about ...."

PS, we just got a new mixer in the mail, and I'm looking for an excuse to use it. If you don't watch out, I may show up at your door with a plate of cookies (turns out you live obscenely close, too).

 _(looking wistfully in Todd's direction)_   

Obscenely close, eh? Like northwards close? You don't provide sustenance to other grad students, perchance? 

I do love cookies. 

'Course I have no standards ---- I'll eat the cheap stale grocery store kind that Scott turns up his homemade-cookie-lovin' nose at.

I'm not sure if it's a talent, or just a remarkable _endurance_: most bloggers would have crawled into real-life shells after just one or two of those (maybe three, since the office-sex one was real-life and funny as hell). I feel like I'm getting old, as bloggers go, and my tolerance for these fights, my desire to focus on a bunch of different discourses simultaneously while mediating responses in different tonalities and different points of reference, my sense that these fights are worth really fighting about.... it's kind of gone.

I don't think it's endurance.  As a commenter, I've been highly abrasive for more than a decade, and nothing like that ever happens to me, even though I always comment under my real name.  In part that may be because commenters aren't worth going after.  But partly I think that (to quote myself) Scott's idea of online interaction is the blind stumble into the snake pit.  There are certain communities that it isn't worth being involved with, because they are based around attacking people, and positioning to get close to the Dear Leader.  (That is not a criticism of LS.)  Likewise, there are certain individual nutters, or even just people who take too much of your energy, who are not worth engaging with even to the extent of taunting them; it's ignore-and-delete all the way.

The sex-in-the-office thing was in a different category, as was perhaps the last thing on the list, which seemed to be sparked from a non-online interaction.  So maybe Scott really does have an unusual talent in this area.

But the thing is, we all _always_ have deadlines.  I have three looming as we speak -- one chapter to finish, another to revise, and a paper to revise-and-resubmit.  And it's been like this for who-knows-how-long?  (And from what I gather, this is never going to change.)

AWB, I'll 
extort
 accept those cookies from you come Christmas.  I'll let you decide on the type, as you're better with those sorts of things than I.  (Just no bacon in them, no matter what ben says.)  

And Sisyphus, you're more than a little northward, right?  Anyway, Todd can't give you any cookies.  There'll barely be enough for me.  (There's an equation in there, somewhere: "where 'N' equals the number of cookies and 'D' Scott's boundless desire for them, &c.)

Noooo! No Cookies?!?!?! 

You know, the desired object will never satisfy the subject's originary Lack, Scott. Your desire for cookies, once satisfied, will only expose that the cookies (petit objet c) were only a substitute for the desired real (the big C) that is inaccessible. Or something.

Anyway, the only way to come to a true understanding of the other is to recognize the impossibility of having your desired object --- only in separation between the subject and the object will there be space to recognize desire. And, uh, Parveen Adams says that's a good thing.  I haven't figured out why yet (oh, Tuesday will be fun!) but, since you need to relinquish the desired object in order to come to terms with your own lack and desire, you should pass the cookies on to me. 

Heh.

Sorry, I've been under the weather and have not heard of the cookie need.  I could have had some hand delievered, but I did not know about this need.  Mom's cookies may make their way to you before Christmas.  You have the interesting life because you are part of a really crazy family, but I will not go into any crazy childhood stories.  Once my thyroid is back in shape, I just might make some cookies even if you get some from another person, Mom's are best.
