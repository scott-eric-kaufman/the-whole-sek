_SEK and his class are brainstorming ideas for their end-of-quarter [rhetoric-in-practice project](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/12/an-end-of-the-quarter-treat-batman-is-my-boss.html)._

**SEK:** Given the fact that we studied _Fellowship of the Ring_ and _Game of Thrones_, I could easily see something like the "[Sean Bean Death Reel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEhtsgu6bJg)" being a viable final project.

**STUDENT #1:** What if we made a perfect copy of the One Ring out of metal?

**SEK:** Nope. You can't turn in anything you bought from Skymall.

**STUDENT #2**: Can we do Reverse Game of Thrones?

**SEK:** A Throne of Games?

**STUDENT #2:** Like we get a regular guy to play Tyrion and hire little people to play everybody elâ€”

**SEK:** No! No reversing Game of Thrones! That's unacceptable on so many levels I don't even know where to begin.

Student 2 should watch _Living In Oblivion_ (as should you, if you haven't seen it).

[In case that was too obscure, I was thinking of [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4je71Tz\_9IE) scene. But the movie really is worth watching.]

It's only obscure to people who aren't as old as us, I think.
