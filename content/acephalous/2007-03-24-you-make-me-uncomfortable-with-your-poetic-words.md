## You Make Me Uncomfortable with Your <em>Poetic</em> Words

Many people noted that the best thing about [that post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/and\_yet\_i\_still.html) was the poetry it inspired.  I agree.  It _would_ be a shame to let it die a quiet death in the comment section.  

eb [started us off](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/and\_yet\_i\_still.html#comment-64003666):
Those lips that your own mouth did move  

Breathed forth the sound that said "I grade,"  

To me that anguished to improve.  

But when I heard your words conveyed  

Straight in my heart discomfort rose,  

Shaking that pen that ever strong  

Was used in writing graceful prose,  

And taught it things it knew all wrong.  

"I grade" you garbled without cease  

And fouled it as rotting pomes  

Doth foul a bunch, which, like old grease  

From kitchen to dump is cast from homes.  

"I grade" you thwarted with a care  

That ruined your course, saying, "as fair..."

Rich quickly [followed suit](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/and\_yet\_i\_still.html#comment-64020652):
Once within a classroom dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,  

Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,  

While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,  

As of a voice gently rapping, rapping about some writing chore.  

`'Tis the TA,' I muttered, `rapping about some writing chore—  

Only this, and nothing more.'

[...]

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,  

`Sir,' said I, `by Email, truly your instruction I deplore;  

But the fact is I was napping, and so gently your voice flapping,  

And incessant mapping, mapping of your lesson plans galore  

That you make me quite uncomfortable—here I opened wide the door;—  

For complaints and nothing more.

[...]

In your class I have been guessing, but no syllable expressing  

To the incessent voice now burned into my brainstem's core;  

More and more I sat divining, with my head slackly reclining  

On how to get the grade that I could have gloated o'er  

That GPA-gainful grade that I could be gloating o'er  

But my marks, they are poor.

[...]

`Instructor!' said I, `thing of evil!—grader still, though but a devil!  

By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God that I adore—  

Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the final grading,  

I shall clasp a higher rating then the one I had before—  

Or the head of your department shall hear of it galore—  

Quoth the TA, `Nevermore.'

This Is Just To Say

I have wasted  

the brain cells  

that were in  

my head-box

and which  

you were probably  

training  

to write things

Forgive me  

I do not understand  

so tired  

and I want a better grade

AHCUAH [chimed in](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/and\_yet\_i\_still.html#comment-64167240):
I appreciate you taking  

your inconvenience to instruct us  

but I really had some problems in your class  

and I would like to explain them to you now.

Every day I wanted to discuss with you  

about the way you grade my papers and  

the way you teach the class,  

but I could not because the things  

you say in class and your words  

disturb me so much I can not.

You make me completely uncomfortable  

with the little things you say in the class  

like how you talk about television  

or how you talk about when you  

are grading our papers and trying to be fair.

You do not seem to care about our grades  

only that they are up  

to your too high standards and  

I can not talk to you because  

you make me completely uncomfortable.

For example, you say you will talk to us  

about our grades but you really will not  

because of how uncomfortable you make me feel  

with your words and what you say.

Finally, [Nicole TWN](http://ellipticcurve.livejournal.com/) produced [the requested sestina](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/and\_yet\_i\_still.html#comment-64179422):
O Teacher, I feel we must share words.  

Perhaps unlike yourself, I am not inclined to bother  

With idle talk. Your words make me uncomfortable.  

I took this class expecting a certain grade  

Of quality.  When it was not met, I decided to speak—  

Not for myself, you understand, but for all who find you unfair.

To be so misunderstood as I is really most unfair.  

Why must you torment me with your words?  

I am stoic; I am manly; I endure; at last, I must speak.  

I have seen enough to know that you never will bother  

To cast off your bias towards your own ideas, to grade  

According to a paper's quality and nothing else.  Uncomfortable!

Perhaps I should have spoken earlier, but I was uncomfortable  

With your words, and with what you say.  Besides, you are unfair  

To those who take this class and want a passing grade.  

Instead, you make us uncomfortable with your words.  

Perhaps I should have attended office hours, but I couldn't bother  

My sensitive conscience with the thought of the words I must speak.

You call yourself objective, but you offend us when you speak  

Of discomfiting notions that make us uncomfortable  

I did not come to college to be bothered  

With this sort of thing.  It is disrespectful and unfair  

To be kept up nights, turning over your uncomfortable words  

When all I wanted was a passing grade.

I plan to contest my grade.  I learned all I know from my brother  

Who is an English teacher himself, and always gave me excellent grades.  

He, I, and all the other students agree you are unfair.  

But they are too ashamed to confront you, and too uncomfortable to speak.  

But I have seen enough… and I am not afraid to be uncomfortable  

So I set pen to paper and wrote these words.

Thank you.  I would not bother to speak  

If I did not want a better grade.  If you find this note uncomfortable,  

You have only yourself to blame, with your unfair words.

Here's a serious question for the readers here, who probably include people with a wide range knowledge about lit crit and psychoanalysis: is anyone actually doing what I called [the method of poetastic analysis](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/i\_am\_making\_peo.html#comment-64251762)?  (From "poetaster", of course.)  I know that "art therapy" exists, of course, but I don't mean that; I mean analysis as a way of figuring out what one really thinks about something -- a sort of cognate of dream interpretation.

I love them all.  If AHCUAH had only converted the text to read in all lower case, including the proper Is, that would be approaching perfection.
