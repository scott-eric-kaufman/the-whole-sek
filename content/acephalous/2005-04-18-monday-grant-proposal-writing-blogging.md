...with a 102 degree fever, Thor's own headache and a Tuesday 9:00 a.m. dealine.  Is it any wonder conservatives so desperately want to crack open our little liberal monopoly on the good life?

If there are any volunteers to read my prospectus before I send it off tomorrow, I'd appreciate the help.  I should finish the section on the decidedly Lamarckian evolution of traditionally animated [Funshine Bear](http://www.partyinabasket.ca/images/Care%!B(MISSING)ears/CB-bev-npkn.gif) into CGI monstrosity [Funshine Bear](http://www.dvdtoons.com/screenshots/news/care\_bears\_journey\_to\_jokealot\_ss2.jpg) by hour's end.  I'll post and open it up for comments shortly thereafter.

Hah, /I/ only have a /paper/ due at 9 AM today! It's, uh, not actually done yet, so I should probably go back to workin' on it, huh?

I do have a grant proposal due tomorrow, though, in my defense against the charge of... something. LOOK OVER THERE, IT'S A GIANT RHINOCEROUS!
