## This blog is no good anymore because:

 * Originally posted at http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/08/this-blog-is-no.html

*   Scott still hasn't finished his dissertation.
*   Without students there can be no [inappropriate office sex](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my\_morning.html).
*   Scott keeps linking to that post even though everyone (except the new readers who email a cultivated OMG! every time he links to it) has already read it.
*   Blogs cannot be good by definition.
*   Scott never replies to comments anymore, even though he would like to,
but must focus on finishing the dissertation he'll never finish.
*   [Fans](http://rhubarbpie.typepad.com/rhubarb/2008/08/i-am-beginning.html) can tell when [narrative arcs stall](http://civpro.blogs.com/civil\_procedure/2006/11/the\_narrative\_a.html) (because Scott still hasn't finished his dissertation).
*   Too much time blogging elsewhere leaves the people who love Scott and Scott alone despondent.
*   Did [Scott mean _Hanukkah_](http://www.google.com/search?q=Hannukah) and must he not be a terrible Jew what with the spurious transliteration of offense?
*   Scott is now an old person and blogs are 2 b 4 the young and young at heart.
*   Writing a dissertation for seven years might as well be abusing crystal meth for how rapidly it ages your proverbial heart (like the [before](http://acephalous.typepad.com/meth01.jpg)-and-[after](http://acephalous.typepad.com/meth02.jpg) addict they use to scare children straight).
*   Scott has written on the same topics so often he has crippled Google's ability to index his site (and thus his ability to find that thing he knows he wrote about back in the summer of a year maybe beginning with a two).
*   But for a short-lived dalliance with a single column that ended in open revolt, the layout and color scheme haven't changed since the day the blog went live in 1922.
*   Now that I, being you, think about it, it never really was that good (not even in 1922 when America had flappers).
*   Scott still hasn't finished his dissertation.

You'll never finish your diss, so just put that right out of your mind.  Even once it is handed in -- defended -- once you have a degree on your wall that certifies that you have a Ph.D. -- once you are working as a professor -- and even after you have retired -- you will still be thinking about some paragraph and whether its word choice was felicitous.

Although the nightmares in which you dream that your dissertation never got done and that you are about to be ejected from your job because they suddenly found out and you will never work again should, gradually, taper off.

I'm with rich.  The word "finish" in association with a dissertation takes on a new meaning---meaning no meaning.  You'll be thinking about it for subsequent articles, books, and inane job-talks.  It is never "finished." - TL

Look, I'm a selfish man.  I need to be hopeful for you so that I can be hopeful for myself.  You **will** turn the dissertation in, because I told you to and because it's fine. Seriously.

The blog never had a narrative arc, because writing a dissertaion, even a narrative one, is not a narrative process.  It, like life, is fragmentary and episodic.  The blog will continue to be interesting, because you will continue to have funny and insightful and random thoughts and put them out, here and elsewhere.  Or not, if you don't feel like it.  But ignore the thing if you need to and we'll (he wrote, speaking for the imagined collectivity) come back when you do.

1922??? Yer damn right I remember the good old days of this blog, when the Deco knicknacks on the sidebars were still gleaming and fresh and the champagne flowed like rain and everyone was wearing a raccoon coat and slicked-down hair and there was that time Dorothy Parker decked the proprietor. 

We had to take the blog across state lines to get enough liquor and Scott tore the engine clean out of it driving it over a fire hydrant somewhere right outside Jersey and  we were stuck in the fields waiting by the side of the road until the wee hours of the morning when we were rescued by some members of Mack Sennett's motion picture troupe and it all became a madcap romp where we threw caviar at each other and were thrown out of no less than three nightclubs by four maitre'ds. 

Yeah, people still had class back then, not like today with all of this here rock and roll music. Hey you kids, get off my lawn!

In agreement -- do not try to finish it, just turn it in and put it behind you.  And don't ever go back and read it ever again.

What will they say if you turn in a dissertation that's not perfect?

They'll say, "Congratulations, Dr. Kaufman!"

It's nice to know others feel the same way about your finishing your work.  Just turn it in and get on with it.  The blog will always be here because you are always involved in some crazy thing.  Life has never been dull for your and yours so just go with the flow.

You _prevented_ those people from _finishing_ the having-sex-in-your-office.  Now you have this dissertation ... karma, perchance?

By way of general advice, don't try and combine dissertation writing with meth. You may think that you're all super-productive, but really you'll just end up like [this](http://picasaweb.google.com/Will.Lifford/WillSusanneAfricanSafariSeptember2007/photo#5116044380405947410), or perhaps [this](http://flickr.com/photos/blinque\_blinque/542146518/in/photostream/).
