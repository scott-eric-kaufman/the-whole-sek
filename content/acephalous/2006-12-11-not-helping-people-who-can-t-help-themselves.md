Another [Asks.com](http://www.ask.com/web?o=0&qsrc=6&l=dir&q=Why+Are+Books+Important):

Oh that last is just priceless...  I've been meaning to do a post on this sort of thing myself - how you can just tell, from some search terms, the uses to which one's work is being put...

I _know_ some of my work's been plagiarized, as I've been contacted by instructors/professors telling me as much.  On the one hand, it leads to inevitable compliments of the "I _knew_ this couldn't be the prose of an undergraduate!"  On the other, however, they never outright say "this looked like top-notch graduate work to me!"  So that should read unintentionally back-handed compliment, then.  On this front, I'm submitting material to Turnitin.com so I can see the originality reports for some of what I've written.  Should be interesting...
