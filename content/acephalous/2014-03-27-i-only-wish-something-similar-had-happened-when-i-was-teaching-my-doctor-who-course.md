You’ll never guess who it is:

[_Professor teaching class on vigilante justice is pepper-sprayed by vigilante seeking justice_](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/03/27/professor-teaching-class-on-vigilante-justice-is-pepper-sprayed-by-vigilante-seeking-justice/)

But of all the bloggers out there who aren’t me, he ranks high on the list of bloggers-likely-to-be-peppered-sprayed-by-a-troll.

**NOTE:** Since I am writing thousands of words a day, I think I'm going to start posting links to them here. I mean, this is my place, I can do what I want, right?

Just curious if you were going to do one of your breakdown reviews of Noah, especially since it was made on the back of a graphic novel specifically created to sell the film. One of the better takes I've read [looks at the film as a Midrashic interpretation of the story](http://io9.com/noah-is-the-best-and-worst-bible-movie-youll-ever-see-1553829598). Some of the camera work was interesting and there were a few clever cinematic moments, but some of the film's messages were written on anvils that fell from the ceiling onto your head. I don't know how Aronofsky hooked up those anvils in the theater, but he did. 

The whole time, though, I kept thinking of Peter Weir's _The Last Wave_.

I'm waiting for a copy to arrive in the Onion's backend -- wow, that sounds awful, but you know what I mean -- but I do plan on writing something about it, have no fear.
