You can be sure I’m going to tell my newly minted niece, Arya Rose, the correct answer to that question.

For the record: I had nothing to do with the fact that my niece’s name is “Arya Rose.”

_Nothing at all_.

The fact that my firstborn will now have to be named “Stark Tyler” is a complete coincidence.
