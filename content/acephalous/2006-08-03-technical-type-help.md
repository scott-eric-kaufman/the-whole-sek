Will someone with knowledge of such things help me figure out what [this is](http://alatorrex6.nourison-rugs.info/)?Â  Maybe how to stop it, even?

Since this site only seems to have the one post, I'm not completely sure what's going on.  

Assuming they're not just using you as their personal lorem ipsut (unlikely, since the underlying domain has piles of subdomains that all seem to be doing similar things to other sites), it's probably one of those annoyng commercial aggregator sites that do nothing but scrape other people's content, trying to generate sufficient hits that they can then make some money from ads.  Since none of their "blogs" seem to have grabbed much content, maybe this is... er... early days for one of those, or they're testing...

Regardless of what they are, you can ask them to stop, or provide clearer attribution of where the post is from, etc. and, if they won't, ask their host to remove the content.

A whois search will sometimes let you know who owns the domain, although many people now use intermediate services to conceal their personal details.  You can eventually find what you want, but it can take a while.  My toddler's just woken up... gotta run...

P.S. if it helps, the IP address I get when pinging the domain (66.112.216.237) seems to be associated with Ironpath Networks: [http://www.ironpath.com/contact.php](http://www.ironpath.com/contact.php)  They sell IT services, and therefore probably aren't the proxiate cause of your problem, but may be able to help you figure out contact details for the person who is...  (anyone who knows more should please correct me before I send Scott on some wild goose chase here...)

N.P., you are an angel among commenters, helping me out when you could've been enjoying your child-free hours to their fullest ... but I think you've nailed it.  Must be some spam aggregator newly born.  I see there's another post up there, this one not by me (nor is this post up there, so maybe it's not automatic).  Hm ... there's nothing like a little wild-goose chase every once in a while to set the blood pumping.  Why not dash off a few fiery emails and see what becomes of it.  

But again, thanks for all your help.  For someone who used to be so technologically literate, my current state of knowledge is disgraceful, really.

I'm not sure I count as fully literate, either, although I was once mistaken for an IT person in the workplace (sort of like [this Guy](http://www.guygoma.com/))...

It must be very similar to this:
