## De-Link Medievalists ... If You Dare!

The other day, Richard Nokes issued [an ultimatum](http://unlocked-wordhoard.blogspot.com/2007/07/blogroll-policy-reform.html): be medieval or be de-linked.  He can de-link [_Acephalous_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/) if he so desires, but before doing so, he should know:

De-link if you [adjustmust](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/07/dear-person-or-.html), Dr. Nokes.  Just remember, I'll kill all your [dragons](http://www.dragnix.net/Basic/HMSflamer.jpg), [monkeys](http://scribalterror.blogs.com/scribal\_terror/images/latini\_monkey\_1.jpg), and [homosexual monks](http://cistercians.shef.ac.uk/image\_gallery/images/0473.jpg) if you do.  You've been warned.

I de-linked your head long ago, but the rest of your body is safe.

I'm going to have nightmares about that image.

I feel I'm missing something, but in what sense is the picture on the other end of that 'homosexual monks' link actually homosexual monks?

You meant homicidal monks right? Please?

Also, what are you doing in the manuscript? (That's required right? The doing of something in the place u r in?)

_Duh_, Adam, they're cutting each other's hair.  What's gayer than that?

As for what I'm doing in the manuscript, well, I don't quite know how I got there.  The Little Womedievalist emailed that to me the other night, and there I was.

Oh, but if you're going to be in the manuscript, the Confessio Amantis is a very appropriate one to be in. Lots of good decapitations in there. Although Gawain might be even better, since it has someone who gets beheaded and actually survives the experience.
