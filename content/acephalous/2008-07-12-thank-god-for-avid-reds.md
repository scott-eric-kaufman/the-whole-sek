([_X-posted_](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/12/thank-god-for-avid-reds/).)

Searching for a quotation in response to John Holbo’s [post](http://crookedtimber.org/2008/07/12/why-did-the-fathers-of-the-american-revolution-hate-america/) on revolutionaries and patriotism, I stumbled across this Google Book artifact:

“Thank Heaven he isn’t [alive today]” is quite a sentiment to say about
the disabled, but what can you do?   Hunchback or no, “he would
probably be an avid RED!”  I wonder when this exchange took place—the
red-baiting obviously dates it, but then again, maybe it doesn’t.  We
hear about “reds” and “commies” from contemporary conservatives now too, but I doubt any of the current commentariat would have
heard of, much less read, Bourne.

As for the quotation I sought:

We have been kneaded so successfully that we approve of
what our society approves, desire what our society desires, and add to
the group our own passionate inertia against change, against the effort
of reason, and the adventure of beauty.

Goldberg and his ilk have little choice but to evince “passionate
inertia against change,” no matter what form that change might take.
They believe, mistakenly, the status quo is a castle keep in which we
were born and must defend — Bourne reminds us society is a La Madeleine
on wheels staffed by mad tireless bakers, adrift on the plains of
history.

madeleine on wheels?

I'm raising an eyebrow at that entire last sentence there. 

PS don't you owe me an email, or is it my turn?

I think that last sentence was brilliant: it makes me think of the "Bakers who bake 'til the dawn in the Night Kitchen" of Maurice Sendak.

Too funny. I found that page online a few days ago and read it to my girlfriend. Here's one of my favorite quotes from the Avid Red:

“This numbing palsy of conservative assent which steals over so many brilliant and sincere young men as they are subjected to the influence of prestige and authority in their profession is the most dangerous disease that threatens youth”.
