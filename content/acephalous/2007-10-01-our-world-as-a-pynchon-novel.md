Please tell me Debra Cagan, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Coalition Affairs to Defense Secretary Roberts Gates, isn't wearing an [Iron Cross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron\_Cross#Second\_World\_War) in this [picture](http://www.huembwas.org/Pictures3/56emb5.jpg).  Because it _looks_ like an [Iron Cross](http://www.hermes-one.com/NaziIronCross2nd.jpg) ... 

(Consider this a demand, not a request.  Much as I like them, I don't want to live in a Pynchon novel.)

Scott - No, she isn't wearing an Iron Cross.  As for what it is, the answer appears to be [here](http://www.huembwas.org/News2/56Emb2005.htm)--it's a medal given to her at the Hungarian embassy in 2005.

Which still doesn't explain why she looks like Alan Cumming in Cabaret.

There are a lot of different variants on the Cross, many of which have equal lengths and flared ends. 

Though with that red leather top she's wearing, I can certainly see where you might have gotten the wrong idea....

_Gravity's Rainbow_ would be particularly bad.
