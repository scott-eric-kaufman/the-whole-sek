Please, SEK, I beg you-- have a look at the new shilling for cash being done by Jack Cashill, and his new "evidence" that Ayers wrote "dreams of my father".

The world needs your smackdown of him.

I'm not SEK, but I say it's SSDD. My blogging is very different from my professional writing: doesn't mean two different people wrote them. Hell, my history blogging is very different from my political blogging: am I three people, now? Is the ghost of my (not dead yet) advisor at my keyboard this minute, shaping my research (actually, that sounds pretty good, not having to write my own stuff up!)?

I know, but SEK did the definitive smackdown of Cashill's earlier crazy posts about this, and I crave more. More, more!  

It was a joy to read.
