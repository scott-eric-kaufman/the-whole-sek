## Quick Hits

So . . . too much parenthetical narration yesterday.  For whatever reason I've been having a ball writing these little scenes.  The quality _will_ improve.  I promise.  Now for a couple of quick notes:

First: I've a [new post](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/sexy\_historicism/) up on the Valve which contains roughly the first 80 percent of tomorrow night's public lecture.  Read it and tell me what you think.

Second: I sincerely thank the person who clicked on an Amazon link and purchased $1,432.91 in baby paraphernalia.  That is _by far_ the easiest $57.32 I've ever earned.  Feel free to splurge on one of [these](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)B000AA2U6C)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1), which you can roll up to [this](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)B0009NDDCA)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) when you're not too busy watching [this](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)B0002WZTFW)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) on one of [these](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)B000B6RV32)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1). 

Third: I'm thinking of a site redesign now that Acephalous is officially one year old.  (I forgot to wish the old bird a happy birthday.  I'd be a terrible parent.)  Jonathan frequently complains about the colors of the text and body.  I like them but he thinks they're unreadable.  What about you?  Would you prefer something more [transparent](http://www.adamkotsko.com/)?  Or simply something different and easier on the eyes?  Or is she fine as is?

Oh my gosh, I love Star Trek.  You are my new best friend. TNG is by far my favorite (I just watched an hour of it today during lunch, the one where only Worf can perceive the shifting temporal realities), but Voyager turned out to be surprisingly good, and I watched all of it. Unfortunately, "Enterprise" coincided with law school, and I didn't watch it--not that I was too into going back into the past to begin with, much as I love Scott Bakula from his Quantum Leap days.

Did I out myself too ferociously as a nerd just now?

Happy birthday by the way.

I like your site's color scheme.  I'd only change the banner/header.

First Salon.com and now you?!?! Keep the current design.

Oh yes, we were supposed to comment. I find the text readable enough, but if you want to change--change it, if yuou don't--don't!  I like it fine, but I would agree about the banner/header. More Headless Blogman! I've even gotten my eyes trained around your overstuffed sidebars.  A true academic! Tons of marginalia!

-It's nice to know that a chair costs more than my car.

-I think the appearance is classy and almost fancy.  Like I'm reading from a scroll written in calligraphy by somebody really organized.

-Had I the time, I'd go to the Valve.  But I must go to the Bed.  Maybe we'll come crash the lecture and check things out first hand.

I like the design, and don't find it difficult to read.  If you're concerned about whether the contrast is high enough for some readers, you could potentially offer people a choice between two designs - allow people to toggle to a higher-contrast version of the site, while using the current version as a default...

Thanks everyone for your kinds words.  I like the design too, but I agree with eM: for someone whose wife worked as a graphic designer for three years, I have a crap banner.  I need to bribe her to change that.  Maybe a hand-delivered seminar paper will do the trick . . . 

P.S.  N. Pepperell, one of the things I love about my audience is that they give me the benefit of the doubt, even when I don't deserve it.  

P.P.S.  Belle, Adam _writes_ science fiction and somehow I don't think he's tops your dorkiness.  I think that's a compliment.
