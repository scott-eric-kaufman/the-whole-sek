Such was the reaction of my students after I informed them of [their murdering ways](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/10/on-informing-your-students-that-theyre-murderers.html) and asked them to tell me what happens [in the gutter between the first two panels](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/robert-kirkman-walking-dead-moment-to-moment-transitions.html). 

Needless to say, teaching _The Walking Dead_ will be directly responsible for me hearing countless things I never thought I'd hear in a classroom.

I only recently started following you here, after seeing your reposts at LG&M, but you make me want to re-enroll in school and take your class. Except, you know, you're in a whole different part of the country, which is a bit of a drag if I'm going to be a part-time, non-degree returning adult student.
