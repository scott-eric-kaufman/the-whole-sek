In case you're wondering why you haven't heard from them, the Facebook friends you contacted recognized your name and knew you didn't need a head-shot of me for the reasons you stated.  (Which were, to be frank, quite lame considering [how extremely difficult it is](http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&hs=sjq&rls=org.mozilla%!A(MISSING)en-US%!A(MISSING)official&q=acephalous+birthday&aq=f&aqi=g1&aql=&oq=) to figure out when my birthday is.)

Also, let me save you some time: not a single one of the results of [a Google image search for my name](http://images.google.com/images?q=%!s(MISSING)cott%!e(MISSING)ric%!k(MISSING)aufman%!)(MISSING) is a picture of me, so you can stop clicking through every image of a person that search returns in the hopes that it'll be me.  (Although I am flattered you clicked through to [this one](http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://thebronze.altervista.org/Immagini/Angel%!P(MISSING)ose/%!B(MISSING)Foto%!D(MISSING)%!d(MISSING)avid-boreanaz-james-marsters-halloween-2004-london-convention-06.jpg&imgrefurl=http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/acephalous\_prou.html&usg=\_\_nQT4V969ys3BnGSgyr\_a\_q\_HO28=&h=587&w=750&sz=55&hl=en&start=455&sig2=lGvv-isu4aD4IvSqNxi\_-Q&um=1&itbs=1&tbnid=cXvc-l3ljOF9hM:&tbnh=110&tbnw=141&prev=/images%!F(MISSING)q%!D(MISSING)%!s(MISSING)cott%!B(MISSING)eric%!B(MISSING)kaufman%26start%!D(MISSING)441%!u(MISSING)m%!D(MISSING)1%!h(MISSING)l%!D(MISSING)en%!s(MISSING)afe%!D(MISSING)off%!c(MISSING)lient%!D(MISSING)firefox-a%!s(MISSING)a%!D(MISSING)N%!r(MISSING)ls%!D(MISSING)org.mozilla:en-US:official%!n(MISSING)dsp%!D(MISSING)21%!t(MISSING)bs%!D(MISSING)isch:1&ei=tTOHS9TnJoHO-QaF-OjjDQ).)  

If you would like a picture of me to deface in what you mistakenly believe will be a hilarious fashion, contact me at myentirenamesquisheduplikethis (at) gmail (dot) com and I'll send you a couple.  

**Update:** if you're so inclined, feel free to scroll through those results and comment on which one you think I should be.  Given [this post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/youre-a-vortex.html) (and the general tenor of the events chronicled here), I know [what I'm voting for](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01157141f61b970c-500wi).

How about [this one](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the\_overdetermined\_image/)?

Seriously, though, what the hell?

Is there a bounty for such a photo? I'll sell [this one](http://tonguebutnodoor.net/sew.jpg) for $100.

You should jack up the price, todd, as that's not only a picture of me, it may well be a picture of me _you took today_.\*

\*Just edit in the bagel dog that I only bought because I had two minutes to get to class and needed something I could eat on the way.\*\*

\*\*For future reference, everyone, even if you slather them in mustard and ketchup, bagel dogs taste like warmed-over ass.

On page 4 is a picture of Sarah Palin....

I KNEW IT.  Think about it. We've never seen them in the same room together.
