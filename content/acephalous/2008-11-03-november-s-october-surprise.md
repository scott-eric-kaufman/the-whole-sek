I feel as if drawing attention to any particular problem of yours is overkill, but d'you think you maybe like Gogol Bordello _too_ much?

I swear to God that in the middle of that I thought he was actually speaking Russian.  Of course, it's probably that my ears are simply not well attuned to the gravel-voice Stephenhawking thang.

I never noticed before just how _ripped_ Headless Lenin III is: look at the washboarding on those abs!

Needless to say, that seals it. I'm going to go vote for Lenin now.

By which I mean the socialist with tight abs.

Yes.  In fact, last night I watched [The Pied Piper of Hutzovina](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013K2ZEA?ie=UTF8&tag=diesekoschmar-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0013K2ZEA), and now I like them _even more_.

 _Of course, it's probably that my ears are simply not well attuned to the gravel-voice Stephenhawking thang._

Actually, it has something to do with how YouTube compressed the audio.  I've uploaded another version.  If need be, I can throw a script up here.

_By which I mean the socialist with tight abs._

I already did!  (Wait, we're talking about Obama, right?)

Unless you know something about Sarah "sharing Alaska's collectively owned natural resource wealth far and wide" Palin's abdomen that I don't, yes.
