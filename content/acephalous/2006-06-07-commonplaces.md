We here at Acephalous Industries are proud to announce the launch of the newest addition to our already outstanding family.  I want everyone to give a Team Acephalous round of applause for the latest breakthrough in blog reader-retention technology: 

"Commonplace"!  

In a joint effort formally coordinated with [Strathmore Sketch](http://www.samflaxny.com/prodimg/508043.jpg)'s pre-existing Commonplace content infrastructure, Acephalous Industries is now able to provide its customers with a constant stream of bleeding edge quotations that cut straight to the crux of the heart of the consumer's innermost matter.  

Our finely crafted passages are gathered by our crack staff and guaranteed to punctuate client tedium and enliven even the dullest of minds.  They'll be short enough to enlighten the addled but deep enough to engross the genius inside each and every one of us.  It combines the pithiness of [Instapundit](http://www.instapundit.com/) with all the intelligence of someone who considers matters with gravity instead of a stop-watch.  

I hope you're excited as I am about this groundbreaking new development.  Now who wants to take this puppy for a spin?
