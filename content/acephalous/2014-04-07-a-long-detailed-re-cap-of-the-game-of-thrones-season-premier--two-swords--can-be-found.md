Since I don't actually read re-caps, I had to pretend I knew what kind of information they contain and the imagine the kind of attitude I would have toward it.

Meaning, yes, I probably just channeled my not-so-inner asshole and made a sarcastic mess of it. But that's why you love me!

Also available now is the [_Lawyers, Guns & Money_ podcast](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2014/04/lgm-podcast-game-of-thrones-season-4-episode-1-two-swords) Steven Attewell and I did on the first episode.

Enjoy!
