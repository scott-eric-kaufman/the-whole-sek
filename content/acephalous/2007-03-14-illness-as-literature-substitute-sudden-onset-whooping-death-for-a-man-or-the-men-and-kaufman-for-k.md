## Illness as Literature: Substitute "Sudden-Onset Whooping-Death" for "a Man" or "the Men" and "Kaufman" for "K."

			But the hands of a man were right at K.'s throat, while the another thrust the knife into his heart and turned it there twice.

With failing sight K. saw how the men drew near his face, leaning cheek-to-cheek to observe the verdict.    

"Like a dog!" he said.  

It seemed as though the shame was to outlive him.

Awww, hope you feel better.  

Damn I'm such a flakey friend. I gotta get you a care package.  I never did make you an Ultimate Belle mix-tape, fearing that you would judge my aesthetic choices, like putting some very obvious choices on (mainly because I've been too poor to buy new music for the last 2 years) and putting a song from Moondance rather than the much more beautiful Astral Weeks on.  

But I gotta get over that. Will put something in the  mail soon.
