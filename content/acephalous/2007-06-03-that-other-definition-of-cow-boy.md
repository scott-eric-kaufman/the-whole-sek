## That Other Definition of "Cow-Boy"

From the _OED_:
_U.S._ _Hist._  A contemptuous appellation applied to some of the tory 
partisans of Westchester Co., New York, during the Revolutionary war, who were 
exceedingly barbarous in the treatment of their opponents who favored the 
American cause (Bartlett _Dict. Amer._).

There must be some back story to this, but I'm too exhausted by yet more pressing concerns to do the digging tonight.  All I can say is, I hate these cow-boys, for they are (quite literally) unpatriotic.  Perhaps some of the über-patriotic cow-boys I know will learn them a little histories from this?

Probably not.

Yes, the cow-boys were the Loyalist militia. It's funny, though--the Patriot militia in New York were even worse. They sacked the press of the Tory printer James Rivington and melted down his equipment for bullets. (Rivington, who was actually a Patriot spy, printed [this snarky picture](http://www.assumption.edu/ahc/1770s/graphics/rivefpicsm.jpg), which shows himself hanged in effigy by the Patriots).  

Through the combined effort of the cow-boys (mostly treated like dirt by the British) and the Patriots, Queens was "denuded of every animal except dogs."

A distant relative of mine, Abraham Carlisle, was hanged for treason in 1778 for having been a "collaborator" during the Revolution.  He was actually a  Pennsylvania Quaker, who was disowned by the Pennsylvania Society of Friends because of his pro-British actions. It's thought that the new American government decided to make an example of him and his friend John Roberts because they were prominent older men.  Apparently Abraham's funeral was extremely well attended.  No other Quakers were put to death, and no other collaborators were executed in Pennsylvania.  

My own branch of the family all claim descent from a man who was "at the Battle of Bunker Hill", but we don't have his first name for some reason, and given the paucity of clues, I've come to suspect that might have been a Loyalist soldier.  His wife Phoebe certainly moved away from her New England home in a hell of a hurry after the war and never took up a Revolutionary War Widow's pension or land grant, which is suspicious.
