Anyone care to finish that syllogism for me?  It appears as if my brother builds the best useless robots in the entire country.  Don't believe me?  Then how do you account for [THIS!](http://www.ece.lsu.edu/images/2005/robot\_2005\_team2.jpeg)

Doesn't look like Louisiana in the background.  Is that really your brother?

The one on the right in the red shirt is indeed my younger brother.  Looks just like my father.  And just like I would, were I to gain a head and about 80 lbs.  Of muscle.  What can I say?  Cancerous but non-malignant tumors coupled with invasive fungal infections makes a body lose some weight.

Also, Mr. Krynoid, that picture was taken in Colorado, so there's a good reason it doesn't look much like Louisiana in the background.  :)

They must be tiny babies.  Unless it eats them very, very slowly.

And here is Google reminding me to lock my door tonight: "eating babies is fun and monkeys slurp up japaneese girl's vomit while a midget rides his bike through transexual transylvania".  

Congrats to your brother.
