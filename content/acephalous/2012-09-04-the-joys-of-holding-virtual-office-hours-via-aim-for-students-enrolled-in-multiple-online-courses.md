			**STUDENT:** Can I write an essay about the rising cost of unnecessary oil platforms off the Korean coast?

**SEK:** I don't see why not. But, um, what are you writing this for?

**STUDENT:** Your class.

**SEK:** My class?

**STUDENT:** Shit, which one am I talking to?

**SEK:** Not the one who's teaching you anything about 
Korean oil  platforms, but luckily for you, the one who won't be 
offended you just  wrote "Shit."

**STUDENT:** Fuck, I won't make that mistake twice.

It's bad enough they don't learn our names in face-to-face classes; online classes will make us that much more faceless....

Funny stuff!  I forgot to extend the drop box the other day.  I get an email from a student who has known me only since August: "Dr. Bruner, the drop box seems to be closed.  I wonder if I misheard you in class to say you were extending the deadline?  Sincerely,"  Then a text from a student who has known me for years (and knows I forget things that aren't in my routine): "Dr. B!  Open the drop box!"
