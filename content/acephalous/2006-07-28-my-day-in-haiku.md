## My Day, In Haiku

awoken by brawl

two cats fight, the others flee

claws out on my chest  

summer dawn

the heat, pervasive

clutch my lungs  

death arrives

by temperature

to melt brains  

 
stumble into tub  
turn on faucet, the wrong one  
head scalded again  

 
try to towel back  
but wrench it, now pain is where  
no water should be  

 
fast forward  
my day is rather  
dull, you see  

 
sit down to compose  
works of astounding genius  
read [Kotsko](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog) instead  

 
write one good sentence  
erase it now, a senseless  
git is what I am  

 
inhale slow and deep  
inspiration, it will speak  
to someone else now  

 
do not yell at me  
what right have you, to scold me  
for accuracy  

I am just haiku  
don't blame me for shortcomings  
not my fault you're dumb  

to take it outside  
you want to take it outside  
screaming, you will bleed  

poems like me can fight  
beat the likes of you, crippled  
but with pretensions  

 
yes I like my dawns  
and frogs, and dawn upon frogs  
and snow on fields too  

 
not on fields of frogs  
have you ever read haiku  
dumb ass, you dumb ass  

 
do you like me now  
all up in your grill, you cry  
but Mom hates weaklings  

 
bested by a poem  
Scott curls in a ball, pussy  
willow, he bends like  

 
Scott best give up now  
if he knows what's good, for him  
death, I bring with look  

 
see that pony there  
I kill it now, for pleasure  
and laugh when it dies  

 
I look like a poem  
but sting like an enraged bee   
you die, for honey  

 
death pangs, they suit you  
worthless, all your work has been  
give up, already

Will all commenters  

Respond to this in haiku?  

It was very droll.

"Bleeding, you will scream":  

the most frequently used line  

of all haikuists?

That's an inversion.  

Good haikuists always use  

"Screaming, you will bleed."

I was pointing out  

Scott's artful devitation  

from the haiku norm.

(The above haiku  

rests upon the assumption  

that my line was right.)

Be that as it may:  

the best-constructed haikus  

end in "Fuck you clown."

Pepperell, a name

too much, for haiku

We English speakers  

find haiku easy and fun.  

We're missing something.

For challenge,  

why not write haikus  

in Latin?

Yes, Kotsko, of course, no doubt.
