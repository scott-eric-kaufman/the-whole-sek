## YOU MUST COMMENT.

Seems my good for nothing sister somehow actually managed to earn herself a degree, so I'm flying across the country to be very bored hearing the names of 3,000 people I'm not related to be mispronounced by someone who clearly has better things to do.  (Can you tell I didn't walk?  _Can you_?)  So if you comment and I don't reply or seem to be sending email into an abyss, it's only because I won't have regular internet access until next Monday.

But you have to congratulate my sister.  Her name is Sarah.  She's not a natural student but struggled her damnedest every semester and is graduating tomorrow.  So congratulate her already.  Because damn it, she deserves it.

Complete waste of time, Sarah.  You'll regret those years later in life.  Unless you spent all your time drinking and / or sleeping with people.  Congratulations!

Congratulations, Sarah! And may your praise in future come unqualified by disclaimers such as that you're "not a natural student"!

Drinking with people and sleeping are also pretty good ways of passing the time as a student.

Congratulations to Sarah!

OK, I've resisted (on principle) the CAPS LOCK \*order\* to add something for thirteen comments now.  But I can resist no longer.

This is good news: congratulations.  Welcome to the room, Sarah.

Congratulations Ms. Kaufman.

SEK,

I just got back from a commencement (drove three hundred miles) and I was not bored at all.  In addition to the family friend who got his MD, I saw a Nobel Laureate get an Honorary Degree and give a short but excellent speech; drank whiskey, champagne and wine; ate steak; and engaged in some promiscuous hugging and kissing with ladies I am not married to.

Hey, She worked hard and is proud of every C and the B's she got. Her brothers may be "A" students, but she struggled and finished.  Now SHE NEEDS A JOB, so she is up for any reasonable offer in the Houston, Texas area.  This way she can move out of her parent's house and begin her new life.  She would have been very hurt if her family was not there and we did leave after she got her walk accross the stage - so it wasn't as long as she had to remain. Now, there are 5 LSU grads in the family - MOM, Scott, Meg, Marty and Sarah!!
