## Racism?!?  In Louisiana?!?  Never!

_Woodlawn High School (circa 1993) in front of Building C.  A gap runs through the center of the brick structure.  The school is built on an active fault.  Service projects include "shave bricks to fix new gaps in walls" and "repair water damage in classrooms caused by newer ones."  Scott, Justin, Jason and Craig sit in a circle during lunch.  They appear to be having an animated discussion.  (Probably about boobs.)  Trey walks up.  He is followed by a passel of fine upstanding citizens led by a man-child named Michael.  As Trey approaches the circle, everyone turns to greet him._

**Scott:** Yo.

**Justin:** Yo.****

**Jason:** Yo.****

**Craig:** Yo.****

**Trey:** Yo. 

**Scott:** What's their problem?

**Trey:** Them? (_He points to the fine upstanding citizens behind him_.)  They want to kick my ass.

**Justin:** Why?

**Trey:** Don't know.  Do you think I should ask?

**Scott:** (_without a hint of sarcasm_)****Why do you want to kick Trey's ass?

**Michael:**  You know him?  (_He points at Trey_.)  'Cause we're gonna kick his ass.

**Scott:** Why?

**Michael:** What's it to you?

**Scott:** I kind of like the little fellow.  He stole a pizza for us once.

**Michael:** I can kick your ass too.

**Scott:** Why?

**Michael:** For that fucker.  (_He points at Trey.  His pacing becomes more frantic.  The attention spans of his posse begin to flag._)  I'm gonna kick his ass. 

_At this point Michael's posse becomes restless.  Shouts of "Kick his ass!" and "Kick his fuckin' ass!" can be heard.  Justin and Craig stand up.  Jason and Scott remain seated.  One of Michael's minions yells "Kick his ass!"  Another, "Kick his fuckin' ass!"  Michael slaps Trey on the back of his head._

**Scott:** Was that really necessary?

**Michael:** Why don't you tell me.

**Scott:** Look.  Let him sit down and eat his lunch.  You can kick his ass some other time what with you being so manly and all.

**Michael:** I can kick his ass now.  (_He takes two steps in Trey's direction.  Scott stands up . . . which is stupid.  Scott has been beaten on a regular basis for three years now.  Everyone knows that Scott doesn't hit back anymore.  People who fight Scott are no longer rewarded for doing so because who_ couldn't _beat up the guy who never hits back?  Yet they do it anyway.  What does Scott hope to accomplish here?_)  Get out of my way.  (_Scott continues to stand in his way.  The bell rings.  Lunch is over.  Scott grabs his bookbag and starts to walk away._)  Don't you turn your back to me!

**Scott:** Sorry but I have a class to get to.  

**Michael:** Fuck that!  (_Michael pushes Scott to the ground.  Scott wonders what happened to kicking Trey's ass.  He looks to a visibly apologetic Trey and knows he'll be able to extort an Icee or two out of this._  _He picks himself up and starts walking to class._)  Come back here you fuckin' pussy!

**Scott:** I'm going to class.  (_Scott decides not to go to class.  Instead he walks to "the black side of campus."  The school itself may be desegregated but the student population isn't.  Scott has black friends.  One of them, Chester, was particularly protective of him and had told him that if he was ever in trouble to head towards the black side of campus.  So Scott did._)

**Michael:** The fuck you are!  (_The pre-fight crowd begins to gather.  As Scott walks he can feel each addition to the group trailing him.  What troubles him is the group beginning to form in front of him.  If they form a circle around him and Michael before he reaches the black side of campus . . . then they do.  Scott is now surrounded.  He turns to face Michael._)  You stupid fucking pussy ass motherfucking ass-face pussy motherfucking son of a motherfucking bitch I will fuck you up!

**Scott:** Why Michael, what a colorful vocabulary you have!

**Michael:** Are you calling me a _nigger_?

_The terrible beating Scott had already resigned himself to ensues.  He should have known better.  He did.  But he has a big mouth.  He knows you know that.  He also knows that those of you who have heard this story before will think to themselves "I think he normally tells it better.  He left something crucial out."  He thinks he did too . . . but he can't remember what it is.  He wants you to feel free to inform him.  Especially Jason since he both reads this blog and was there.  And Zach and Jamie, who have both heard him tell this story before.  He wants to perfect it for his bio-pic.  It'll start with his time in New Jersey and Canada and move forward to his High School of Horrors before concluding with [His Infamous Morning](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my\_morning.html) . . ._

Our own perfected biographies.  Fine tuned for better reception.  I do remember this story in a less (or perhaps more) abridged version.  Details have been omitted.  Context is everything.

I thought Craig stole the pizza....  And you left out Kerry.   That was the best part...kinda like the end of a Rocky movie.  Or any Sylvester Stallone movie for that matter.

And if you are going to put this in your bio can you give me a bigger part?

Yes--pretty sure Craig stole the pizza.  Trey was the one that gave Shannon a birthday present wrapped in a tampon box.
