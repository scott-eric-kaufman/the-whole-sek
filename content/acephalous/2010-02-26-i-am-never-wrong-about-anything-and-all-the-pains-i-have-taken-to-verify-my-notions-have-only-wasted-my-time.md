## "I am never wrong about anything, and all the pains I have taken to verify my notions have only wasted my time."

			I'm no G.B. Shaw, as my previous post makes plain.\* But since it turned into a version of [Humiliation](http://www.insidehighered.com/views/mclemee/mclemee109),
I say we all should play. What lesson drilled into your head by someone
you trusted later turned out to be hilariously misguided? I can start
the festivities again by pointing you to an account of the
undergraduate honors seminar in which I learned to [never trust the Jews](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/12/combobulated-being-a-play-in-which-we-laugh-at-arrogant-undergraduates.html).   

\*The
quotation is from a letter to H.G. Wells in which Shaw chided him for
being too sanguine about the future of Stalinist Russia.
