[This saddens me](http://bitchphd.blogspot.com/2010/10/elephant-in-room.html), because [back in the day](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/another\_mla\_pan.html), when I was a nobody, she helped make me an extremely minor somebody.  (She also got me into [the best parties](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week\_2006\_11\_26.html#005856).   Was the Internet just that much different then, or is it just me?)   So, best of luck to Dr. B. and her fellow travelers, all of whom will be  missed.\*

\*Except for the ones who post elsewhere, as they’ll just be missed by virtue of not all being in the same place.

She's right about the witheriness tho: several months with just a few posts by Taddy (heavily trolled in their comments), and I wondered whether teh blog was gonna end. It had a great run, and the Bitch Collective wrote some awesome stuff.
