## Kill me hard until I die, please

I recently received an irate email complaining I'd unfairly slagged [_The Shack_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0964729237/diesekoschmar-20).  It went something like this:
You CLAIM to be a TRUTH CHRISTIAN but you deny this manifest vehicle of TRUTH its rightful place in Christian bookstores?  What kind of TRUTH do you tell your doctors to tell their patients to console them for the consolation of the Lord whose TRUTH is undeniably a consolation to them AND their doctors in their time of ADVERSITY if you cannot recognize the TRUTH of this spiritual vehicle for consoling TRUTH?  THE SHACK CONTAINS THE LORD'S SPIRIT WHO ARE YOU TO DENY IT TO PEOPLE?

Except the email LOUDLY ambled through another 11,391 variations on the words "truth," "consolation" and "spirit."  It was a curious email, and not just because I've never mentioned my hobby of ministering to medical professionals before on the blog.  Unlike the occasional emails I receive for some other Scott Kaufman, this one addressed me as "Scott _Eric_ Kaufman," the name I adopted because 

1.  I'm beyond pretentious.2.  I wanted to differentiate myself from all the other Scott Kaufmans out there. 

There's another Scott Eric Kaufman in Southern California, but I don't think the guy who worked on _[Chicks with Sticks](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0442262/)_ would ever claim to be a TRUTH CHRISTIAN.  I gave this mystery wrapped in a puzzling enigma of troubling complexity the five seconds it deserved and reported it as spam to Google.  

Time passed.  

This morning I receive another, even more irate email, which opens by chiding me for lacking the courage to answer the first.  It accuses me of being unworthy of ministering to the medical community, an effete unchristian man tainted by my contact with the Godless world.  (I concede the latter point.)  Then it called me childish in my faith and quoted something I'd written to back it up:
You wrote, "Without a doubt, _The Shack_ subversively undermines key doctrines of the Christian faith."  DOES NOT DOES NOT DOES NOT [...] DOES NOT DOES NOT DOES NOT [...] DOES NOT DOES NOT DOES NOT [...] DOES NOT DOES NOT DOES NOT!

Armed with the sentence I'd written, I quickly [found the reason behind the misunderstanding](http://www.google.com/search?q=%!W(MISSING)ithout+a+doubt%!C(MISSING)+The+Shack+subversively+undermines+key+doctrines+of+the+Christian+faith.+%!)(MISSING) and the title of this post.

There's only one way you can keep clear from this misunderstanding.  The other Scott Eric Kaufman is Dr. Scott Eric Kaufman.  You will have to selflessly refrain from completing your dissertation so that you can accurately refer to yourself as "Mr. Scott Eric Kaufman".

Man, and I was worried about the email _I_ wrote you....

Wait -- did I send that to the wrong Scott Eric Kaufman?

Alternatively, become a British subject and get a knighthood so you can be Sir Scott Eric Kaufman.  Or become adopted as the younger son of an Marquis, so you can be Lord Scott Eric Kaufman.

Or convert to Catholicism and work your way up the church heirarchy so you can be Pope Scott I.

I could go on all day.  If I didn't have work to get to.

Change your name to Scott Erik Kaufman. That's what Erik Satie did.

NOTE: Satie's mother was Scottish, and Erik was baptized as an Anglican under the name Eric. Then his mother died and his father's mother had him rebaptized as a Catholic. My sources didn't say anything about uninstalling the Anglican baptism, but it seems to me that they should have. Catholic Eric was still named Eric. He became Erik on his own, in his late teens I think. And that was the beginning of Dada.

No John Jacob Emersons in Google. There are a few John J Emersons, including two Confederate pensioners from Arkansas. I suspect that one guy was listed twice, but who am I to argue with Confederate record-keeping?

I suggest going all out and changing your name to Acephalous Ward.

I thought I had a pretty unique name before Google. Turns out I am also a fictional rabbi who is brutally murdered in a chilling hate crime depicted by an aspiring novelist.

A bit more visibility:  

[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/books/24shack.html](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/books/24shack.html)

But don't fret. An infelicitous typo has long had my moniker connected high up the GoogleRank with resignation from Red Action and leaving Manchester pending publication of "No Retreat".

Oddly enough, we just moved to Pittsburg, Kansas, whose location in the Southeast corner of the state has led to a proliferation of organizations and companies incorporating "SEK" -- for South East Kansas -- in their names. 

The first time I encountered this was in a flyer for the S.E.K. Humane Society, and I did think it odd that there would be _such_ a mass of Acephalous readers and supporters in this area that they would band together in pursuit of more humane treatment for our host. Then my wife, much smarter than I and less blog-laden, parsed it properly.

Pittsburg Kansas is Hell. Mulberry is worse, in case you want to go a step lower.
