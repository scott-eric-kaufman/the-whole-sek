## What If I Just Call Him Jack?

A sentence discovered during latest re-re-re-revision of the London chapter:
In a recently discovered essay London wrote upon returning from London ...

Checking the tracked changes, I discover I'd already corrected this sentence, which earlier read:
In a recently discovered essay he wrote upon returning from London, London ...

Looking a little more carefully at the tracked changes, I learn the above was itself a revision:
In a recently discovered essay London wrote upon returning from England ...

I can see why I changed it to something dreadful and ungainly: England is not nearly specific enough.  Had to specify London, lest someone get the impression he frolicked with other lily-white folk in Berwick-upon-Tweed.  

The lesson?  No more _arumfartzen_ with tracked changes.  A writer need never be reminded that his present blockheadedness is but an extension of his past.

_The lesson?_ 

How about the dangers of too much specificity? Is it important to your argument that the essay turned up recently or that London was in London? If you don't want to kill the info, just shuffle off the fun but unnecessary bits to a footnote.

There might not be anything wrong with "London wrote in an essay, 'blah.'"

No, go in the other direction.  That will serve as an easy test of whether anyone is reading these chapters.

"In a recently discovered minor essay London wrote upon returning from the City of London in London  -- not Greater London (geographically; no connection with "greater" vs "minor" essays is meant) -- London discoursed upon one of his favorite meals, the London Broil (not to be confused with Swanson's dinner).

Now if you could only determine that he'd been influenced by Blake's _London_ in some way during this trip...

If only he'd bought a copy while he was over there we'd have London's London Blake's _London_ for the archives now.

If a gecko crawled over that, it would be a demonstration of London's London Blake's _London_ London forces.

On an obliquely related literary matter: my experience has taught me that it's very hard to lecture on the science fiction of Philip K Dick without saying the word _dick_ a great deal, and in a variety of unfortunate and titterworthy locutions.

That's why everyone calls him PKD.

PKD.  Always makes me think of [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picardie).

Maybe we should just call him Horselover Fat.

This reminds me of the time I had to edit a review featuring both [Sir Walter Raleigh](http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/ralegh.htm) and [Sir Walter Raleigh](http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poet/369.html).  I fixed matters by using "Ralegh" for Raleigh #1--or so I thought, until the U of C press got their hands on the review & tried standardizing the spellings.  (Me: "No! Stet! Alternate spelling! Not the same Raleigh!")

i just finished a paper on Keith Jarrett and at some point during the writing process i determined that i was always going to refer to him as Keith Jarrett never just Jarrett. if this is falls within acceptable usage then it seems that always using Jack London might eliminate some of your linguistic difficulties. Thoughts?

Or you could, following my suggestion, refer to him as JGL, and then following Adam's kind of sound-association, start referring to him as Jingle.
