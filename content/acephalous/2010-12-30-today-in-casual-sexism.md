According to one local announcer for the Houston Rockets, playing the Miami Heat is difficult because that

There are just too many holes in too many dikes and not nearly enough fingers.

His partner’s response?

You’ve got to be a real man to force your finger in a dike.

My response?

GO HEAT.

**NOTE:** Today was actually “last night,” and I may’ve have incorrectly transcribed “dyke” as “dike” in that second quotation there. I considered “dyke,” but since the announcer’s “hilarious” rape pun was clearly a pun, I left it as is.
