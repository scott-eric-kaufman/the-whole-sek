I am impressed your students seem to do all the assignments! For your sanity though, I hope they stop for a while. Good luck with the grading.

Actually, Cassis, I began with 23 students, but by the time the quarter ended, I only had 14.  That said, I'll write a more serious post tomorrow concerning my complaints about the relentless grading that online classes entail.  

_GROUNDHOG DAY presents a similar scenario...without the grading._

You don't have to tell me twice . . . or my wife, for that matter, as I spent the better part of the summer having the same conversation with her:

**HER:** What are you doing today?

**ME:** Grading.

**HER:** I thought you finished grading yesterday?

**ME:** That assignment, yes, but now they've turned in their drafts of the next one, and I need to grade them before Wednesday because their final one's due on—

**HER:** —so what you're saying is that it can't, it won't and it don't stop?

**ME:** Not until it does, babe, not until it does.
