## <em>Of Course</em> He's a Blacksmith; a Giraffe Would Have Been Unsubtle

The title refers to Earnest Everhard, the protagonist of Jack London's [_The Iron Heel_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556520719/diesekoschmar-20).  I reckon the novel's structured by Lamarckian evolutionary theory; but, as you well know, I'm reluctant to press any issue without some [solid evidence](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/the\_best\_quotat.html).  While I would have preferred discovering Everhard had been a giraffe, I will gladly settle for blacksmith.  

What am I talking about?  Why, only the two most prominent examples of Lamarckian processes in the late nineteenth century.  We all remember the giraffe's neck from high school.  From Lamarck's _Système des animaux sans vertèbres_ (1801)\*:
It is interesting to observe the result of habit in the peculiar shape and size of the giraffe: this animal, the tallest of the mammals, is known to live in the interior of Africa in places where the soil is nearly always arid and barren, so that it is obliged to browse on the leaves of trees and to make constant efforts to reach them. From this habit long maintained in all its race, it has resulted that the animal's forelegs have become longer than its hind-legs, and that its neck is lengthened to such a degree that the giraffe, without standing up on its hind-legs, attains a height of six meters. (122)

You may not be familiar with the blacksmith's arm, however.  As I've written in some five-odd different forms:
Later Lamarckian thinkers—Herbert Spencer foremost among them—departed from this theory of subtle fluid excavation in favor of ostensibly more scientific theories of germ- and body-cells.   According to it, as the parent’s body developed, it created germ-cells which possessed the traits it had acquired; those germ-cells would become the body-cells of their off-spring, thereby transmitting an acquired characteristic.   To borrow one of the period’s favorite examples—found, in this instance, in Vernon Kellogg’s _Darwinism Today_—a Lamarckian believed that the son of a blacksmith would inherit a genetic predilection for larger, more powerful biceps.  A predilection is no guarantee, however, that the son’s biceps will ever rival his father’s.  He could spend his life in a bank instead of a smithy, in which case his biceps would no more formidable than those of fellow clerks.  But should he ever exercise his arms, he would build muscle at a pace likely to astonish his coworkers; even if he does not, his son—the blacksmith’s grandson—would still inherit a diminished faculty for superior bicep-building, a genetic testament to his family’s social origins.  His son—the blacksmith’s great-grandson—would inherit a talent for what [Silas Weir] Mitchell calls “brain-work,” as well as the nimble fingers required of a teller.  Whether the great-grandson’s stronger predilection for quick fingers qualifies as an improvement over his grandfather’s predilection for sinewy arms, depends entirely on the observer.  A locksmith who values a quick mind and agile fingers over brute strength would consider it progress.  A stevedore would not.

Given the ubiquity of the blacksmith example, for my purposes, Everhard is a giraffe.  Just the one I've been searching for, too.  (If you'd like to visualize me at my desk, papers and books flying as I desperately seek the novel in which the socialist revolutionary is a giraffe, by all means, go ahead.  You ought to be as amused as I am relieved.)

\*I love the mysteriousness of the full title: S_ystème des Animaux sans vertèbres, ou Tableau général des classes, des ordres et des genres de ces animaux; présentant leurs caractères essentiels et leur distribution d’après les considérations de leurs rapports naturels et de leur organisation, et suivant l’arrangement établi dans les galeries du Muséum d’Histoire naturelle, parmi leurs dépouilles conservées; précédé du Discours d’ouverture de l’an VIII de la République._ Nothing like leaving a little something to the imagination.

But did he work that title into the text of the book?

I think it only appeared in stage adaptation, but I could mistaken.
