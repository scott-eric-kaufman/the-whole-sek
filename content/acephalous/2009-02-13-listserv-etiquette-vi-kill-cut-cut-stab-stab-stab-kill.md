Hey, at least you're getting redundant updates on the same day.  My campus voicemail sometimes can't be bothered to tell me about new messages until two or three days after they've been recorded.

I have a feeling that perhaps the attachments caused some delayed listserv funkiness, to which the senders initially responded by sending additional emails, resulting in the Friday afternoon deluge. Regardless, there were too many announcements about the talk. 

Also: Hello. I'm a fellow 39Ber (we seem to favor the same staff meeting), and really liked your posts on teaching film and comics.

To: [departmental listserv]  

From: [Professional Diva and Specialist in interesting-sounding subject]  

Subject: When are we having the interesting-sounding talk?

Date: Saturday  

Time: 6 p.m.

Excuse me, weren't we going to have a specialist come to give an interesting-sounding talk? When is this happening? Why aren't people getting the word out about this? This talk is highly important and I don't want to hear of any of my graduate students skipping it!

Counting on seeing all of you there,

PD

Collin, if only you knew.  (One of those accidental "Reply:" vs. "Reply to All:" errors, but still . . . 

Terry, happy to be of service.  I'd say you should say hello to me at the next meeting, but you probably remember everyone's name from that first meeting as well as I do---so, um, the unshaven guy with the backward baseball cap who talks _way_ too much?  Say hello to him at the next meeting, because he's me.

Sisyphus, yours wasn't there when I wrote mine, but I should say this:

At some point---after a certain number of reminders---people need to assume that we're not like PD.  I mean, we all do mark things down on our calendars if we want to attend them.  Then we go, or maybe we don't, depending on the day.  But we can't be cajoled into going, I don't think.  Guilted, yes, most certainly yes, by advisors and the like, but cajoled?  We're too stubborn, damn it.

Oh, it was last Friday, Feb 13, not this Friday, Feb 20?

I'm sorry I missed it.

So, how was it?
