			**COP:** Have you noticed anything unusual this morning?

**SEK:** Not to my knowledge.

**COP:** Nothing at all? Not even a…suspicious dump truck?

**SEK:** A suspicious dump truck? I’ve seen a lot of dump trucks across the street, at the construction site, but I don’t know what would make one suspicious.

**COP:** You know, like one that didn’t look like it…belonged with the other dump trucks.

**SEK:** Sorry, they look like a happy little dump truck family to me.

**COP:** I understand. Just keep your eyes peeled, and call me if you see anything suspicious.

**SEK:** Will do.
