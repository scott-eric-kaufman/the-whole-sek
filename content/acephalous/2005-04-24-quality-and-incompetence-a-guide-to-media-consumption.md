## Quality and Incompetence: A Guide to Media Consumption

Like everyone else, I always cruise Amazon's reviews of whatever it is I'm watching/reading/listening to so that I might better know how to appraise whatever it is I'm watching/reading/listening to.  The most intelligent reviewers of any thing I watch/read/listen to are always the ones who spend what little free time they have attacking the movies/shows/books/albums they despise.  

For reasons I don't entirely understand, I believe that there's so much media (in McLuhan's all-encompassing sense of the term) out there it makes no sense to spend one's time hectoring what one dislikes and more time consuming what one likes.  Notable exceptions abound, of course, but these are almost exclusively media with agenda, e.g. _Left Behind_, _The Complete Works of Kirk Cameron_, etc.  

(A right-thinking Christian will counter that _Will and Grace_ has a homosexual agenda, and from their perspective it may look that way, but the producers of _Will and Grace_ never, I imagine, sat down and decided to push their homosexual agenda on the American people.  They work for NBC.  They're capitalists first.  So, this right-minded Christian would counter, are the authors/illustrators/producers/Kirk Camerons responsible for _Left Behind_.  True.  But whatever else the producers of _Will and Grace_ are, they're not the vanguard of the homosexualization of Christian America in the same way that the folks behind _Left Behind_ are the vanguard of the Christian Right.  Don't believe me?  Ask [Joan Didion](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/files/16749.htm).)

But I digress.   I complain about those who complain not because they complain, no, but because they complain so poorly.  They leave in the mouths of complainants a taste that encourages them not to complain in the future.  Examples?  Reading reviews of _[Deadwood](http://www.hbo.com/deadwood/)_, a show I've learned to love during my convalescence,  [Timothy VM "TVM"](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-glance/-/A20WRMFV12X8R2/1/ref=cm\_cr\_auth/103-8289502-8607027?%!F(MISSING)encoding=UTF8) informs me that
[t]he dialogue was ridiculous. I have no problems with the use of "bad"
language in movies, but this was extremely juvenile! I would guess that
at least half the sentences include the F word at least once. It was so
gratuitous, e.g., "I ain't f\*cking goin' down stairs!"  The story line was very week.

[D. White Billy](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-glance/-/A83M9JS9JPVV4/1/ref=cm\_cr\_auth/103-8289502-8607027?%!F(MISSING)encoding=UTF8), a.k.a. rinkleroot, desires nothing more in life than a [Freud SD508 Super Dado Set with Anti-Kickback Design](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00004RK0P/ref=wl\_it\_dp/103-8289502-8607027?%!F(MISSING)encoding=UTF8&coliid=I2ZF0TGZ3APTYK&v=glance&colid=3T1R84LGJ422).  (Myself, I'm partial to Freud with a little kickback, but to each his own.)  D. White Billy wants me to know how puerile and stupid am I for liking a show that
really insults a persons intelligence, how difficult is it to write
nothing but cussing over and over. Obviously the show is out to attract
a very immature audience that thinks cursing is cool. Stay far away
from TRASHWOOD!!

Actually, the cocksucker's right about one thing: cussin' is fuckin' cool.  But [Lance Christian "game over man"](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-glance/-/A3LW6FZ12WUX2A/1/ref=cm\_cr\_auth/103-8289502-8607027?%!F(MISSING)encoding=UTF8), whose tag reveals that that's his REAL NAME, laughs at me and "all the people who are so guilable to buy into this."  What are "all the people" buying into these days?  According to "game over man," we're a passel of anti-realists who don't realize that people in "the grittish lawless west" didn't swear.  Why are we so ignorant about the realities of the West?  Because we
obviously aren't that big of a fan of western movies.John Wayne acted
in movies a hundred times better than this,and those films dealt with
the same wicked lowlife villains.But did you hear him constantly saying
F this and F that you Fing CSer??The same goes for the mind numbingly
dull and pointless sex scenes.Do we really need a lesbian bath scene in
a western?It's all just another excuse for Hollywood to justify this
CRAP as "art".

The argument, if I understand "game over man," is that current Hollywood productions don't represent reality.  Old Hollywood productions do.  John Wayne's West is the real West.  I hadn't known about the privileged access 1950s Hollywood Westerns had to the reality of the American West before "game over man," but now I understand.  He's right.  "Deadwood is for people with an IQ under 80."  How could I have been so blind?  If you'll excuse me, Kirk Cameron's ministry's on in five minutes and I haven't even started popping the corn yet...

What is it with you and the word "passel" lately? Nobody gets infatuated with words like you, A.
