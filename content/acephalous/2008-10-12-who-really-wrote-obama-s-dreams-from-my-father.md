**Part 1: The “Argument”**

According to Jack Cashill—in an article [first published](http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=76731) at WorldNetDaily—_Dreams from My Father_
was probably written by Bill Ayers. Cashill opens by demonstrating that
Obama, unlike every undergraduate ever, published crap poems in a
college literary journal. These crap poems “show not a glint of
promise,” Cashill tells us, nor did a “heavily edited, unsigned student
case comment” published in the _Harvard Law Review_.  He then quotes an attorney consulted by _Politico_, who called it “a fairly standard example of the genre.”  Cashill has a point here: 

The “temperate legal language” of “a fairly standard example” of “a heavily edited, unsigned student case comment” _is_
completely different from the style Obama would employ a few years
later in his autobiography. Cashill is right to be suspicious. Who
wouldn’t write their autobiography in the temperate language of an
anonymous legal brief? What style is better suited to the tale of being
abandoned by a father and raised to be a black man by a white woman in
the wake of the Civil Right Movements? 

[None](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141182229/diesekoschmar-20).  

But Cashill isn’t content to let the matter rest on logic.  He consults an expert—in this case, [Patrick Juola](http://www.mathcs.duq.edu/%!E(MISSING)juola/) of the [Authorship Attribution Program](http://www.jgaap.com/)—and
is advised to continue doing “good old-fashioned literary detective
work” of the sort that’s proven the plays of William Shakespeare were
written by [Roger Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, William Stanley, Walter Raleigh, Edmund Spenser, or Edward de Vere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespearean\_authorship).  Cashill is no ordinary literary detective: in the past he has been called upon [to rescue celebrity biographies](http://www.cashill.com/natl\_general/did\_bill\_ayers\_write\_3.htm), so he recognizes when someone, in this case “[w]hoever rescued Barack Obama’s _Dreams from My Father_[,] invest[s] considerable time to invent a distinct voice and style for an unknown author.”  And who is this someone?  

Bill Ayers.  

How does Cashill know?  Because the “distinct voice and style” Ayers invents for Obama “[is surely Ayers’ [own]](http://www.cashill.com/natl\_general/did\_bill\_ayers\_write\_1.htm).”  Ayers invented a style—his own—then wrote _Dreams from My Father_ in it.  To the untrained eye, that may sound ridiculous; but as a Doctor of Philosophy of Literature, I assure you his “[deconstruction](http://www.cashill.com/natl\_general/did\_bill\_ayers\_write\_2.htm)” of Obama’s autobiography is sound and valid.  

His technical argument begins by pointing out that both Obama’s _Dreams from My Father_ and Ayers’ _Fugitive Days_
“are obsessed with memory and its instability.” Both address this
heretofore unheard topic in the history of autobiography in a very
similar style. Compare this passage from Obama:

Identity is funny being yourself is funny as you are
never yourself to yourself except as you remember yourself and then of
course you do not believe yourself you do not really believe yourself
why should you, you know so well so very well that it is not yourself.

To this one from Ayers:

Now it could not be yourself because you cannot remember
right and if you do remember right it does not sound right and of
course it does not sound right because it is not right. You are of
course never yourself.

The [obsession with the instability of memory](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1878972081/diesekoschmar-20/)
should be evident even to those who have never ghost-written celebrity
autobiographies. But Cashill’s deconstruction is far from complete. He
amasses a boatload of irrefutable evidence:

1.  Both Obama and Ayers “use ’storms’ and ‘horizons’ as metaphor and as reality.”
2.  “Ayers and Obama also speak often of waves and wind, Obama at least a dozen times on wind alone.”
3.  The polyamorous Ayers has “_tangled_ love affairs” while the undergraduate Obama has “_tangled_ arguments.”
4.  “On at least 12 occasions, Obama speaks of ‘despair,’” an emotion Ayers has been known to feel.
5.  “Obama . . . has a fondness for the word ‘murky’ and its aquatic usages.”
6.  Both . . . make conspicuous use of the word ‘flutter.’”
7.  The “Fugitive Days” excerpt scores a 54 on reading ease and a 12th
grade reading level. The “Dreams’” excerpt scores a 54.8 on reading
ease and a 12th grade reading level.

If Cashill’s math fails to convince you—54 is quite close to 54.8,
but numbers might not be to your taste—consider that in his analysis,
he “introduce[s his] own book, _Sucker Punch_ . . . [a]s a control.”  How much more scientific does his deconstruction need to be?

**Part Two: The Stupid**

At _The Corner_, Andy McCarthy [evaluates](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTlkMTdmNDRkMTM1ODZkNGNkZmRiNDFjMDE4YzRjMjg=)
Cashill’s argument and proves himself to be an idiot by finding
Cashill’s “lengthy analysis . . . thorough, thoughtful, and
alarming—particularly his deconstruction of the text in Obama’s memoir
and comparison to the themes, sophistication and signature phraseology
of Bill Ayers’ memoir.” To be blunt: if you find Cashill’s
identification of “sea imagery” and his lists of words both Obama and
Ayers use to be particularly anything other than laughable pablum,
you’re an [eighth-wit](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/half-wit).  

If, however, you only use Cashill’s juvenile musings as [a hypothetical which, if true, suggests all the unsavory things you already believe about Obama](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13398),
then you’ve fully embraced the Cashill Doctrine. What do I mean by
that? If you deconstruct Cashill’s name, you’ll find that it contains
the words “cash” and shill.” “Cash” refers to paper bank notes which,
in more robust times, could be exchanged for goods or services. A
“shill,” according to the _Oxford English Dictionary_, is “one
who poses as a disinterested advocate of another but is actually of the
latter’s party; a mouthpiece, a stooge.” It goes without saying that
shills often shill for cash, but in this case, I think we can say the
shill’s shilling for cash and [attention](http://whiskeyfire.typepad.com/whiskey\_fire/2008/10/very-competent.html).  

Because no one with any literary training can read Cashill’s tripe
without recognizing it as the shoddy work of a dim student asked to
compare and contrast two texts.

Actually, Scott, I think the cobbled-together nature of the Pentateuch is the very foundation of our faith: without the repetition and self-contradiction in the text, the Rabbinic tradition would never have developed. And without the Talmudic attempts to make sense of the random, to create continuity out of coalition, there’s no literary analysis. You, my friend, are the intellectual descendant of Hillel (I, on the other hand, am the intellectual descendant of Shammai; present in the text but rarely cited or taken much note of).

FWIW, my spouse has read _Audacity of Hope_ and just started reading _Dream of my father_ (both by audiobook), and is quite sure that the same person — the same ‘voice’ — wrote both. My spouse was very, very amused when I related this ghostwriter theory.

No I'm not.  I have nothing to do with Hillel, as all it does it jam my inbox full of "OBAMA HATES ISRAEL" spam---wait, you mean _historically_.  That, yes.  

I've actually read both Obama books---if you'd like .pdf copies, all you need do is ask.  (And not necessarily me.  I asked someone who works for the campaign and they emailed me copies.  I think they're unofficial campaign literature at this point.)  But your spouse is correct, but only sort of: the voice of the introduction to _Dreams from My Father_ approximates that of _The Audacity of Hope_, but the voice of _Dreams from My Father_ itself is far more Baldwinian, and in a good way.  I mean, he's no James Baldwin, but for paragraphs at a time, you can't help but be impressed by his imitation.

I'm not really looking to read either of them at the moment, thanks. And I'm no afficionado of autobiography, either; most of the content of these books has been brought into the public sphere by other discussions anyway.

I suspect that my spouse's judgement may be slightly clouded, as well, by the fact that the literal voice is the same: both audiobooks were [read by Obama himself](http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/enSearch/searchResults.jsp?BV\_UseBVCookie=Yes&N=0&Ntx=mode%!B(MISSING)matchallpartial&D=obama&Dx=mode%!B(MISSING)matchallpartial&Ntk=S\_Author&Ntt=obama&x=0&y=0).
