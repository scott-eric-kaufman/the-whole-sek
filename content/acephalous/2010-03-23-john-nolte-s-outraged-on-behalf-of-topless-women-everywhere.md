## John Nolte's outraged on behalf of topless women everywhere.

It goes without saying that John Nolte will write something like [this](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jjmnolte/2010/03/23/disneys-degrading-boobie-test-imagine-if-walmart-did-this/):

Annually we are showered with Leftist films created by morally superior beings who lecture us on human rights, civil rights, feminism, lookism, racism and any other “ism” they can conceive, when in real life they’re the very worst in all of these departments.

He honestly believes that because some people on the left are sexist or racist, everyone on the right is morally superior despite, you know, supporting policies designed to protect the interests of white males. In this case, his ire is raised by a _New York Post_ [article](http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/real\_booby\_booty\_hAZOnlKHK0z1CvDaDgkU8M) about the casting call for the fourth _Pirates of the Caribbean_ movie:

The filmmakers sent out a casting call last week seeking “beautiful female fit models. Must be 5ft7in-5ft8in, size 4 or 6, no bigger or smaller. Age 18-25. Must have a lean dancer body. Must have real breasts. Do not submit if you have implants.” And they warn that there’ll be a “show and tell” day. To make sure LA talent scouts don’t get caught in a “booby trap,” potential lassies will have to undergo a Hollywood-style jiggle-your-jugs test and jog for judges.

Nolte is outraged on behalf of surgically-enhanced women everywhere:

This isn’t some sleazy porn peddler in the valley doing this, this is…Disney. DISNEY is going to subject and exploit young women desperate to be stars to the indignity of a booby ”show and tell.” DISNEY is going to have them jog in place for producers and casting agents in order to keep score of the bounciness of their breasts.

Not only is this a case of discrimination against women whose only crime was undergoing a dangerous surgical procedure in order to enhance their appeal to sexists like Nolte, it involves a particularly dehumanizing "booby 'show and tell'" in which woman will be asked to "jog in place for producers and casting agents in order to keep score of the bounciness of their breasts." How does he know this? It says so right in [the actual, unexpurgated casting call](http://www.moviehole.net/201024092-exclusive-pirates-of-the-caribbean-casting-call):

Must be 5'7-5'8, Size four or six - no bigger or smaller. Age 18 to 25. Must have a lean dancer body. Must have real breasts. Do not submit if you have implants. This is a show and tell of costumes with the director and the producers. Plan on an entire day of trying on clothes and being photographed.

Sticklers might insist that the prepositional phrase "of costumes" modifies "show and tell," and that there's nothing in the casting call about actresses being asked to "jog in place" so producers and casting can "keep score of the bounciness of their breasts." Since it's not in the casting call, where did this idea of a "booby 'show and tell'" in which a parade of topless women jiggle only what the good Lord gave them come from? Where else?

_The imagination of John Nolte_.

The man can't even defend _hypothetical_ women without undressing them in his mind. This isn't to say the casting call isn't sexist, because like most items relating to Hollywood and the female form, it clearly is. The point here, as usual, is that conservatives who like to think of themselves as morally superior to liberals when it comes to racial or gender equality always reveal themselves to be purveyors of the very ills they decry. In this respect, Nolte is no different than affirmative action opponents who offer, as proof that we live in a post-racial society, the fact that there's a nigger in the White House.\*

\*Which reminds me: I really ought to write about _that_ lovely conversation one day.

Actually, I think "the imagination of Cynthia Fagen" is the issue: Nolte doesn't add anything to her anatomical musings.

I did hear one guy say "Well, I guess I'll have to vote for the nigger". There are degrees.

I wonder what aesthetic dictates that they "not have implants"?  I would think that the stipulation, "lean dancer's body", would already disqualify women with cartoonish enhancements.  And truthfully, I know not of this John Nolte fellow nor generally read the website he posts at.

[On the _LGM_-version of this post](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/03/john-nolte-is-outraged-on-behalf-of-topless-women-everywhere/comment-page-1#comment-37948), the guy who writes my favorite television show explains the logic:

In this case, with the age also called out, it seems to be for an acting gig. They may well be trying to cast someone as a teenager or adolescent girl, too. You see, you want an actor over the age of 18 so you don’t run into the child labor protection rules that limit your shooting hours, but want them to look quite a bit younger, hence the slender build and smaller, ah, development.

And the films is a period story after all, the female characters cannot look surgically modified. Or can they and am I just a detail-obsessed person who happens to never haven seen any of the films?

Nolte is not a sexist.  He totally taken women seriously... from the neck down.

Dan, I've got to say that this is the strangest iteration of the "when they came for X, I said nothing" statement I've ever seen:

On the other hand, if some racist producer wants to pick up market share in Mexico, he’ll openly discriminate against a white actor in order to hire a Mexican actor.

What?  I mean, _what_?

You mean the one where the handsome rogue fights ghosts and animated skeletons while being chased by an immortal squid-headed pirate?  No, I don't think a pair of implants will rock your belief from its suspension.
