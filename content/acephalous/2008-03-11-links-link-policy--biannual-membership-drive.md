**PART THE FIRST:**

If you write a blog you think I'd like to read but don't think I do, feel free to self-promote shamelessly in the comments below.  

**PART THE SECOND:**

_Acephalous_ still has a [_Facebook_ group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=4683279156).  You're more than welcome to become a charter member.  (One day that might even mean something.  Something inexpensive, sure, but _something_ nonetheless.)  

**PART THE THIRD:**

If you've linked to something I've written, don't expect me to respond.  It's not that I don't _want_ to, it's just highly unlikely I know you've written it.  

Once upon a time, before "[My Morning](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my\_morning.html)" had been re-re-re-re-reposted to a million spam-blogs, I had a Google Alert to inform me when someone linked to _Acephalous_.  But I couldn't handle the hundreds of legitimate emails the spam-blogs prompted, so I turned the Alert off.  

Now when you link to me, I have no way of knowing.   (Unless I subscribe to your RSS feed, in which case I'll discover the link about [five](http://whatinthehell.blogsome.com/2008/02/29/is-the-real-name-of-this-blogs-author/) [days](http://www.roughtheory.org/content/greater-scott/) later when I catch up on my blog reading ... and feel like a cad for not having responded sooner.)  

If you respond to something I write and want me to read it, send me an email saying as much.  Otherwise, you'll have to rely on your site popping up on the rare occasions I check my stats.  (Which ain't too often.)

You could look at mine. You linked to it once.  It's pretty dumb.

My blog is fairly mundane - my dissertation seems to suck all of the creativity out of me.  I might just have to join your facebook group, though.

Since I read your blog pretty much every day I work (unless the day is especially busy), I thought you might want to read our little record store blog, lockwood & summit at www.euclidrecords.blogspot.com. We do all sortsa fun things, like the post the other day wherein we essentially liveblogged a day at the record store.

I almost lost a friend defending you during the casper affair. That said my blog is usual undergrad affair, i.e. Zizek-related blog farts.

Me!  I don't update nearly as often as I should, but when I do, it's at least sometimes about history and history of science.  (I love that you're using history of science ideas in your dissertation, even if I never have any intelligent comments to make here on yr blog.)
