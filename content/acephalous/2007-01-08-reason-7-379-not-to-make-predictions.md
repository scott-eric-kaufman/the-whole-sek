## Reason 7,379 Not to Make Predictions

From Wood Hutchinson's _[Handbook of Health](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20294/20294-h/20294-h.htm)_ (1911):
Within fifty years from now the habitual use of alcohol will probably
have become quite rare. It is already becoming "good form" among the
best people not to drink; and the fashion will spread, as the bad
effects of alcohol become more generally understood.

The title page identifies Hutchinson as a "Sometimes Professor."  Normally, I'm not sure what that means.  This time, I think I understand:
_Sometime Professor of Anatomy, University of Iowa; Professor of
Comparative Pathology and Methods of Science Teaching, University of
Buffalo; Lecturer, London Medical Graduates' College and University of
London; and State Health Officer of Oregon._

To be boring about this for a moment, his prediction probably seemed entirely reasonable at the time.  Passing a constitutional amendment takes a lot of consent of the governed.

While I won't join in the mockery of his credentials, I will ding him for the phrase "the best people" -- even if one can imagine reading it without giggling, it renders the claim about trends unfalsifiable.

I wasn't mocking his credentials so much as the general locution "sometimes professor."  In fact, I'm _not-_mocking his credentials, since in his case, the appellation fits.

As for effect of the rising temperance movement on his prediction, I think "social ostracism" and "federal prohibition" are two different beasts, no?  I mean, the reason to ding him for the "best people" line is precisely because so many future "best people" would benefit from (or be created by) Prohibition.  Jay Gatz, anyone?

E. Phemeral Sometime was a speculator who got rich just long enough to endow a chair, thus creating the Sometime Professor of Anatomy.

Possibly he is a "Sometimes Professor" in the same way that cookies are a "Sometimes Food."

A professor is a sometimes thing. But could we sing something so disrepectful to the institution of Tenure?

Anyway, was he sometimes a professor or was he sometime professor of whatever (old-fashioned but not obscure academic jargon, surely). Or is their misprint with an extra _s_ the point of the joke? It's getting late here.
