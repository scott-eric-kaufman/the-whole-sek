Give it up already, Mr. President.  Even _Kissinger_ is cringing.

I feel worst for the potato headed young man sitting next to the Kissingers, cause, you know, he's got that big ole head to carry around.

Also America.  I feel bad for America.

Also also, it's a simple thing: if the flag is frontwards facing you, it's backwards for the people in front of you; say, photographers.  Maybe we can come up with a mnemonic to help him remember this.

Never mind, he won't have time to learn it.

Wait, the flag is backwards?  Aren't flags double-sided?  I mean, it's not upside down, is it?

Is that the joke, the flag is backwards?

Another backwards flag: [http://www.grunt.com/images-bs/1st%!I(MISSING)wo%!F(MISSING)lag%!R(MISSING)aising.jpg](http://www.grunt.com/images-bs/1st%!I(MISSING)wo%!F(MISSING)lag%!R(MISSING)aising.jpg)

Yeah, see, [that flag](http://www.grunt.com/images-bs/1st%!I(MISSING)wo%!F(MISSING)lag%!R(MISSING)aising.jpg) is pivoting in a wind-based fashion around a pole, and so would only be backwards if they had managed to tie the stripes to the pole.  Our President has the ability to hold the flag any damn way he pleases, including, as tradition would indicate, with the stars in the upper left corner for those facing him.

At a certain stage in a child's development, s/he will respond to your waving at him/her by waving at her/himself, not yet having learned that it's conventional to turn one's hand in the direction of one's interlocutor to wave.  GWB has regressed prior to _l'étade de miroir_.

We have a cat who also waves at her own face when we wave at her; but I think she's just Giving Us The Paw.

Is the lady between Kissinger and Mr. Potato Head alive, or is she a wax figure from Madame Tussaud's strategically placed for would be assassins? - TL

Tradition, what a dangerously conservative basis of evaluation.  But of course, as with all incidences of Bush Derangement Syndrome, there is no possible evidence that does not support your theory.

Kissinger looks sleepy. Or drunk.
