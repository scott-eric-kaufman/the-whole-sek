## What's Cooking?

Now that this dreadful cold—somehow acquired in a crisp Southern California August—has loosened its thick fingers from my throat, I'm in the mood to blog again.  Work, too.  I spent today revising the chapter I'd planned on finishing before my unfortunate appointment with the ass-end of a felon's Honda Civic.  (Despite not having been convicted, I can still call him a felon, as he committed the felony he would have been convicted of had the police been able to find him.)  Not the heady intellectual waters I thought I'd have charted by now, but not nothing—quite a lot, actually, considering what's been thrown at me these past two years.  All of which is mere preface to the meat of this post.

Meat which, serial punster I am, is very much about meat.  

You see, back when I was in high school, I converted to ethical vegetarianism.  Being the serious sort (and an athlete), I quickly decided my ethical vegetarianism needed to be taken to the next level.  So I gave veganism 110%!f(MISSING)or the better part of two years.  Were it not for a beautiful woman and a Louisiana concoction called a "deep-fried 'grilled'-cheese sandwich"—the irony is duly noted, but in the South, if it ain't boiled blisteringly spicy or deep-fried, it ain't fit for consumption—I might very well be the same annoyingly proselytizing gink I was then.  

Tainted by the power of cheese and general allure of dairy, eventually my ethical objections sloughed away and I considered eating meat again.  Well, that and an article in _The New England Journal of Medicine_ arguing that people who ate red meat and chicken but no fish developed Alzheimer's-like symptoms.  I didn't eat red meat or chicken, but I also didn't eat fish, which meant that I'd start suffering from Alzheimer's-like symptoms _any day now_.  I started eating fish.  Even convinced a few other people to.  (So maybe I'm _not_ not the annoyingly proselytizing gink I was then.)  

Considering what 99.99%!o(MISSING)f the population ate, I was a god amongst nutritionists.  Guzzling green tea, inhaling everything soy, eating fresh fish, working out four times a week—you know, the kind of guy everyone loves to loathe.  Like [Granny](http://grannyvibe.blogspot.com/2006/08/international-fuck-broccoli-day.html), I was positive I'd bought myself a couple extra decades on this mortal coil before anyone demanded I shuffle off ... then the test came back positive and it turned out I didn't.  All those years of "healthy" living turned out not to be so healthy.  

How did I respond?  I ditched vegetarianism.  In stages.  I began with a little chicken.  Sharing a table with General Tso again was a life-altering experience.  Still, it was months before I graduated to pork, and I have yet to matriculate in the School of Red Meat.  (I tried a few weeks back but failed "disastrously."  That _is_ a euphemism for what you think it is.)  All of which brings me to tonight's quiz:
**What did Scott prepare for dinner tonight?**

**A.  [Smothered Pork Chops](http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD\_9936\_22401,00.html)   
B.  [Pan Fried Pork Chops](http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD\_9936\_10770,00.html)  
C.  [Stuffed Grilled Pork Chops](http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD\_9936\_20641,00.html)  
D.  [Eggs and Sausage and a Side of Toast](http://www.officialtomwaits.com/music/m\_nd\_lyr.htm#Eggs\_And\_Sausage)\***

The winner of tonight's quiz will recieve an offer to replicate said dinner at some point in the (no doubt far distant) future.  The answer is not as clear-cut as it may seem.  Some knowledge of the Food Channel and apartment living is required ... but may also throw you off my scent, as I'm a creative mutt sometimes, fully able to ignore fire-regulations in a single bound.\*\*

\* When I searched for a very common slang term meaning "debilitatingly soused," I came across these [two](http://www.chrismclaren.com/blog/wp-content/images/2006/01/tom\_gr.jpg) [pictures](http://www.albeshiloh.com/josskeith.jpg).  Hence, the change in direction.  But don't you love the synchronicity there?  That of all the people in the world, _those two_ would be the ones who were the ones who were the ones?  (To paraphrase one of them.)

\*\* Yes, dinner-blogging is a new nadir.  But I want to write, demand an audience, and the post I tried to write arrived stillborn.  What's a guy to do?  Not write at all?  No, no, of course that's correct.  Better nothing than this, but still, if John & Belle can toddler-blog, I can solips ... no, I see what you mean now.  If only I hadn't hit post!

Is it just me, or does your "Of Interest Elsewhere" sidebar repeat itself sixteen times?

No, it does.  I just noticed that when I entered your address in the blogroll, however.  (You've been in my RSS reader, but not blogrolled until now.  Ironic, no?  I blame your inclusion in the blogroll for this travesty...and, well, something I probably did accidentally, and will now try to correct.)

Pork chops and sausage, eh?  Pretty sure we're about as far from kosher as Irvine is from Kabul.

I would enthusiastically embrace veganism were it not for its hostile stance on prime rib.  That, and you have to admit, Scott, those soy cutlets and soy chicken nuggets and various other soy meat-replacements have the palatibility of damp cardboard.

Oh, I don't know - Michael Pollan's book, _The Omnivore's Dilemma_ has been getting a lot of attention of late, and it addresses this very same issue of whether or not to be a vegan/vegetarian.  He even takes a (respectful) shot or two at Pinker's _Animal Liberation_...

So you could argue that you're not _just_ dinner-blogging, you're also engaging in the recent debate about the consequences of what we eat and how we produce it.

Worth a try, anyway...

Pork AND cornbread!?!?! Yea, it's choice C. Plus, you've dropped the stuffed (cushion) stuff enough to give this one away. 

All this means I'll be completely incorrect, but I'll stick with C.

It's funny that the song lyrics below the "Eggs & Sausage" link is the song lyrics to "Better Off Without a Wife," that is, it's funny given your situation. 

OK, I'll leave your site for a while now.

Not HIV Alex, although I can see why you'd think that given my phrasing.  I meant to reference the thyroid cancer, but one doesn't talk about that being "positive" out of context.  It came back positive as "malignant," instead of benign.

Brian and Casey, two good guesses; both, however, were wrong.  I would've done C, but my tiny grill's on the porch and I have to lug it to the park to use it (apartment regulations).  That said, you guys had the right logic, only a limited understanding of my current apartment situation.  I opted for the Southern goodness of B. 

Casey, _are you trying to get me in trouble_?  (You're not.  The Little Womedievalist would get the Tom Waits reference and swoon.)

Mike, yes, kosher hasn't been in my vocabulary for some time ... and yet, we still own two sets of forks and spoons.  Go figure.

_[...] and yet, we still own two sets of forks and spoons._

You can [use one set to go digging](http://www.cinema.com/news/item/5656/billy-bobs-fear-of-spoons.phtml) and then you won't have to worry about dirtying your _good_ silverware.

Speaking of backups, I've noticed your site still hasn't quite recovered from my intrusion onto your blogroll. Have you figured out what's causing the problem yet?

Well, if by "good" you mean "the set I don't go digging with," then yes, that works.  (I'm not surprised about Billy Bob, either.  Have you ever heard [his albums](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=/gp/search%!F(MISSING)%!i(MISSING)ndex=music%!k(MISSING)eywords=billy%!b(MISSING)ob%!t(MISSING)horton%!\(MISSING)_encoding=UTF8)?  The man is odd ... which is why I love him, despite all those barely B-film he stars in and champions.

And no, I haven't addeed it back to the sidebar yet because it's still misbehaving.  I'm sure it's a del.icio.us thing, though, so I'll add it back.  Truth be told, I hadn't been adding all the items I'd want to add to it anyway, but will, I'm sure, someday.

His albums are actually surprisingly good. They're quirky in the way you'd expect anything he does to be. The man's got crossover potential, what can I say? As for his movies, I think _Sling Blade_ alone is worth all the crap he's done. It was received rather well (critically, at least) upon release, but it seems to have slipped under the radar since. It's a very underappreciated film.
