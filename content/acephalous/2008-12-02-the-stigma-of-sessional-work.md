## The stigma of sessional work

Given [how lovely the market is this year](http://academiccog.blogspot.com/2008/12/movement-on-wiki.html), I wonder how faculty who earned tenure in the '50s and '60s and '70s will respond to up-and-coming scholars who slummed as adjuncts or lecturers during the Great Recession of the December 2007 and Counting.  Will they convince themselves they marketed their wares when the state of the nation was equally bleak?

Jonathan Culler of Boston prepares to return home after successfully landing a job at MLA 1974.
  

Or will they admit that the prospects for the current crop of newly-minted doctorates are sufficiently dim that the ban on hiring anyone who deigned to take a position because he liked food and needed shelter should be lifted?

I'm a post-doc, so I shouldn't even be commenting here. But as long as the work ain't actually making your hands bleed, you're good to go, no? Call it a form of scholarly Stoicism...

I dunno, dude, saying that there's a recession and hideous job prospects for 2007-on makes it sound like there were jobs available before that rather than a 40 percent success rate for new grads. It's been dismal for a while now. Like all of the 90s and 00s, if not longer.

I just spotted [this in IHE](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/12/03/kentucky):   

“I cannot imagine a teacher taking the risk of working in a rural neighborhood community college without having tenure,” Alexander said. “Working in a community college is a kiss of death for an academic who has a desire to work at a research university or even a four-year doctoral granting institution. You don’t move up once you get down in the community college level. What’s the motivation for someone moving into a non-tenure track position, unless there just aren’t any other jobs available? The quality of faculty will go down.”  

I disagree, and, ironically, the elimination of tenure at the CC level may well make it _more_ acceptable to shoot for "better" four-year jobs: if there's no tenure at the CC, then there's no increased risk to leaving for a tenure-track position elsewhere; no reason to be complacent or get settled. Of course, I don't really believe that tenure is the attraction this guy claims it is for CC teachers, though it may well be that they need to offer higher pay to attract serious candidates under a non-tenure system.  

Getting back to the original point of the post, though, I also disagree about the mobility issue. On search committees I've been on, a candidate with the experience of full-time teaching -- CC or 4-year -- has a significant advantage over those who just look smart on paper. The assumption that they've been "initiated" or "broken in" or "become experienced" or at least gotten some basic syllabi and course organization skills down is a surprisingly strong component in the decisions I've seen.   

It's true that after a few years it becomes more problematic, though someone who's held down a steady job (as opposed to institution hopping) and kept their scholarship active wouldn't, I don't think, be disadvantaged.   

I think most of the older faculty you're worried about, Scott, have moved on to bigger and better things -- retirement -- and the oldest faculty now would have lived through the job drought of the 80s. It's different at more prestigious schools, perhaps, but that's not where most of the jobs are, long-term.

I started off in the lowest of academic slums, an academic slum so bad that community college faculty lock their car doors when driving through the area and clutch their purses a bit tighter when they see us at conferences.

That's right, I taught at a for-profit vocational school.

I'm now tenure-track at a good university, I have grants and papers and visiting appointments and all that, and I'm doing all the things one must do to claw one's way up the academic ladder.  My teaching experience was considered an asset in my tt search.

OK, it probably helped that I did this for extra cash while in grad school, and after grad school I did the traditional (for my field, anyway) postdoc with a bit of adjuncting on the side, with all of those experiences at places with Proper Pedigree Names.  So my pedigree is still quite pure.  Still, I slummed it, I enjoyed it (I actually preferred it to my TA experiences at Big Name U), I put that experience high on the CV, during interviews I talked about how much fun I had working with my students at the career school, and I got a tt job.  So it can be done.
