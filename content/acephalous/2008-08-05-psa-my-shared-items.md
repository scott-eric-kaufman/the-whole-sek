## PSA: My "Shared Items"

If you 1) use Google Reader for RSS and 2) have ever exchanged emails with me, you may be like the reader who sent me the following note:
I admit defeat.  I have no clue why you share what you share through Google Reader.  Since neither rhyme nor reason guides your selections, I can only assume you're playing a schizophrenic in an online [LARP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LARP) to which I'm not privy.

Not quite.  The reason I share posts about bands I've never heard of, science I don't understand, theorists whose work baffles me, painfully cute cat hijinks, the physics of baseball, and the stupidity of prominent columnists is that I'm on some computer other than my desktop and want to revisit those posts when I'm on my main machine.  (Ninety-percent of the time, I'm on my wife's laptop but want to download an .mp3 or two to the computer my .mp3 player syncs with.)

If you'd rather not have my contingent list of random items appear in your RSS reader, you can "hide" me via [this link](http://www.google.com/reader/settings?display=friends).  (Something's off about the use of "hide" there.  The idea of you being able to hide me without my knowing about it is unsettling.  I'm nobody's unwitting Anne Frank.  You can't be discretely secreting me to annexes without my consent or, and this is the unsettling part, my not realizing you've done so.  I'm nobody's [unwitting Truman](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009UC7QQ/diesekoschmar-20), either.  But I digress.)  

If for some reason you _want_ my mental ejecta cluttering up your RSS reader, you can subscribe to it via the same link.  Honestly though, you have much better things to do with your time.  I'm not even sure why you're reading this.  You already know how to subscribe or unsubscribe, so these words—the ones you're currently, as in right now, reading—they're totally superfluous and you know it.  So why are you still reading them?  Too tired to Ctrl-w back to something sensible?  Afflicted with dread textual inertia?  Do you think maybe I'm building up to something funny, even though by now you're almost certain I'm not, but there's still a chance I am, and if I am you don't want to miss it?  

Rest easy, dear reader.  Had you stopped, you wouldn't have missed a thing.

This just raises the question of what your starred items are for.
