Two stray lines in the _Wired_ [review](http://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/05/trekkers-take-illogical-new-star-trek-warps-coherency/) of _Star Trek_ and my befuddlement at the season finale of _Fringe_ ("[There's One More Of Everything](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1400652/fullcredits#writers)") disappeared:

Abrams, with his go-to writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (_Fringe, Mission: Impossible III_), came up with a clever enough solution.  Using the well-worn _Star Trek_ gimmick of time travel, they
would establish a new universe for the old characters to play in—while preserving the adventures of Gene Roddenberry’s original series
in their own time line.  

Orci and Kurtzman wrote _Star Trek_ and the season finale _and_ the season finale of _Fringe_.  Not only did both feature a Leonard Nimoy cameo, both relied on the
same narrative device to introduce him into the plot: contiguous
universes and the ability to travel between them. 

(_Here there be spoilers._)

**Brief synopsis:** Two Harvard lab partners ([John Noble](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633604/)'s Walter Bishop and Leonard Nimoy's before-this-episode unseen-but-frequently-mentioned William Bell) experiment on children and give them the ability to locate the weak points between contiguous universes.  They also devise a means of traveling between these universes.  Walter Bishop accidentally kills an assistant and loses his mind.  Couple of decades of institutionalization follow.  His son Peter ([Joshua Jackson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005045/)) eventually coaxes him out of the asylum and into the employ of the FBI.  By this time William Bell has become the CEO of a very successful company called Massive Dynamic.  The Bishops wrestle with events ranging from improbable and impossible.  These events are directly and indirectly connected to Massive Dynamic.  

The season finale revisits a character with the ability to teleport ([Jared Harris](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0364813/)' chilling David Robert Jones), only now he seems to be able to throw open the barn door between continguous universes.  Looks like this:

[![Fringe portals](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f8fd1f6970c-500pi "Fringe portals")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f8fd1f6970c-pi)   

As the episode opens he drives a truck through one of those and shoots people.  The Bishops and the FBI track Jones to a lake house they once visited before Walter's institutionalization.  They are told that Walter once lost some precious thing there that is crucial to stopping Jones from popping back and forth between realities.  Walter cannot remember what that is but makes an offhand remark that the last time he and Peter were in that lake house Peter was very sick.  Peter responds, "I don't remember being very sick."  Why not?

[![Fringe tombstone peter bishop](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f8fd6b4970c-500pi "Fringe tombstone peter bishop")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f8fd6b4970c-pi)   

Because as we learn when Walter goes to the cemetary _Peter died when he was seven years old_.  That would be the precious thing Walter lost the last time he went to the lake house.  Then who is the Peter Bishop who hasn't been dead the past quarter century?  Best I can figure, he is a Peter Bishop from a contiguous universe who was kidnapped by Walter sometime after his Peter died.  (Thus answering in the oddest way possible the eternal custodial question of whether you can kidnap your own children.)  How can I be sure?  

Because we finally get a glimpse of another America when the Bishops' FBI liaison Olivia Dunham ([Anna Torv](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1396022/)) is stood up by William Bell.  As she leaves the restaurant where they were supposed to meet she receives a phone call.  She is told to come to the Massive Dynamic building.  She enters the elevator and about halfway up people suddenly appear and disappear _because Bell punched the elevator through one of those portals_.  She is escorted out of the elevator into an office.  She spots this on his desk:

[![Fringe obama new white house](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01157085c461970b-500pi "Fringe obama new white house")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01157085c461970b-pi)   

Obama's still President but what's this about a new White House? Dunham and Bell have a brief conversation before the camera pans through the window to reveal where this meeting is taking place:

[![Fringe twin towers](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01157085c572970b-500pi "Fringe twin towers")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01157085c572970b-pi)   

I think we know what happened to the old White House now.  The implications of this scenario are as improbable as anything on the show to date: Orci and Kurtzman expect us to believe that a competent Bush administration read the "[Bin Laden Determined to Strike in US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CIA\_Memo.JPG)" memo and acted upon it, thereby postponing the 9/11 attack into the Obama era.  No dice.  I prefer to believe they want us to think that it took awhile to rebuild the White House after it (but not the Twin Towers) was destroyed on 9/11.  

But that's neither here nor there.  What bothers me about the season finale is that it means _I watched the same gag be played by the same people **twice** on the same day_.

The plot so nice they used it twice....

Seems like the corporate owners of these intellectual properties would be a little concerned that they're being exposed to liability for plagiarism, not to mention the danger of becoming an instant cliche (not that these time travel plots aren't already.). Also, they might want to start restricting the multi-tasking of their creative types, which might be a good thing for underemployed creative types.

You don't have any thoughts on Lost, do you? I think I'm actually lost this time around...

Very good ideas, those are.  I wonder if their popularity plays into the suits not pulling Abrams aside and saying, "Look, we love you J.J., but people are gonna catch on if you keep this up."  The needs of the now outweighing the needs of tomorrow and all.  As for the underemployed creative types, well, I think suits are all about milking the sure things for as long as they're sure things.  Those unknown people?  Fuckwads, every last one of the---wait, you have a great idea for a popular new series?  Have I told you, lately, that I love you?

_You don't have any thoughts on Lost, do you? I think I'm actually lost this time around..._

They're sitting on the DVR right now.  Like you, I got baffled, but I figured it was a product of watching a television show like a television show, instead of how it's supposed to be watched: as a DVD collection of an entire series.  So I started squirreling them away last month and will blitz through the last five episodes one night.  If I can make heads of tails of it---actually, when I can't make heads or tails of it, as with _Fringe_---I'll write it up.

Is Fringe worth watching? I'm done with Season 2 of The Wire because of you. Next up is BSG, if I can obtain it by some means.

I would argue that they are different in so far as they have different implications.  In Star Trek the alternate reality is unidirectional.  Original Spock is in a reality not his own because of time travel and he is unable to rejoin his own reality.  This creates a meta issue of continuity between the original and the new.  

In Fringe the idea is that the people in different dimensions are in fact moving concurrently in a way that allows people to cross back and forth.  That both of them are using a kind of parallel universe conceit doesn't mean that they are the same plot element.  The implications are completely different.

I haven't seen Star Trek yet, but parallel universes in both Lost and Fringe is disappointing. I agree that it works with both plots, but if they're such good writers they could've come up with something different... 

Nice blog, this is my first comment.  

(excuse my English, i'm not a native speaker.)
