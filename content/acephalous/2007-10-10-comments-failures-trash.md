## Comments, Failures, Trash

Apologies in advance for the wave of spam that's about to disrupt the site.  I had to turn off the capture function ... because if I can't read it, I can't expect you to.  

However, this means that all those spammers targeting [my morning](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my\_morning.html) will make headway ... and for that, I apologize.  

All I ask is that you not be fooled: they offer discounts on pills to make you large, hard and happy ... but they lie.  

Not that I know, mind you ... but believe you me, they lie.

Technically, I can't miss what hasn't happened yet.  I suppose I'll miss 'em soon enough, if my twenties were any indication.

i miss Mikhail Emelianov - what the hell, man? i have to stumble upon you commenting on someone else's blog, you bastard! i'm coming over to your house right now to recommit you to our group project, yes, the same project you were personally raving about just the other day - all Russians are traitors, no wonder you lost the Cold War [sulking].

I miss smoking, don't you? smoking _does_ make you look cooler, i'm only now starting to realize it...

Man, I can respond on autopilot today: 

Technically, I can't miss what I've never done.  I suppose I'd miss it soon enough if I did it, if video games were any indication.
