([_x-posted_](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/09/04/voter-registration-data/).)

(_Title updated to reflect the awesomeness of information contain within the post_.)

Eric’s [comment](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/09/04/community-organizersucker/#comment-19152)
got me thinking about the effect new voter registration would have on
the upcoming election. I looked high and low for some hard numbers but
found none. So, being the “citizen journalist” I am, I scoured the
internet and crunched them myself.

All the information comes from the states themselves. I’ve noted the
period of time the numbers cover (as the data varies between states) as
well as any circumstances preventing me from drawing firm conclusions.
If you’re able to locate any of the data that eluded me, drop a note in
the comments and I’ll add it to the list.

If you don’t feel like digging through the numbers, here’s the short answer: if I were a Republican, I’d be very, very worried.

Now let's see if any of them actually make it to the polls to vote.

Uh huh.  Here's a short poem entitled "America August 2008":

Two roads have diverged, and at last we can see  

That Langston's America never will be  

Our song of ourselves is a jingle of lies  

And hope is a thing that will peck out your eyes

The comic forms are inherently cheery.  Anapestic tetrameter -- like most of Dr. Seuss.

This dreadful one-stanza piece may be, comically, the best sort of poetry I can make.  I read it at an open mic last night, and the audience really seemed to understand it.  (Though the thing is tightly focussed in place as well as time.  The public library in Amherst, Massachusetts has special collections for both Frost and Dickinson.)  The American poetry tradition is inescapable for people around here, even as the myth of America sickens and dies, so it's like a dog returning to his vomit again and again.

Looking at it, the difference in registrations is greater than the difference in vote count in the 2004 presidential election in two states, Iowa and Nevada.  Senate vote differences would be interesting, too.  Does [538](http://www.fivethirtyeight.com) use these numbers, I wonder?

Rich, I'm ignoring your depressing poetry.  This is supposed to be a thing of hope, not more of the same.  (Damn lines, stuck in my head.)

Rosie, much obliged.  I've updated the list.

As a politico I can see the advantages of cultivating hope even based on the slim reed of un-analyzed voter registration data not even for the critical states and ignoring what's likely to happen even in the best available case of Obama winning, but as a poet my impulse is to reach for a rock.  Have you seen the [much-linked Scott McCloud "four tribes" drawing](http://joshcorey.blogspot.com/2008/08/when-four-tribes-go-to-war.html)?  That was very helpful to me, because it at last gave me a self-understandable reason for why I write.  (Once, at a picnic, all the poets except me participated in a game of writing down why they wrote, and came up with various statements about beauty, self-expression, etc.  The best I could do was mutter "to annoy people.")
