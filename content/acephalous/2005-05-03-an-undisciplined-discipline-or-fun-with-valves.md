Why am I reproducing Sean McCann's [post](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/an\_undisciplined\_discipline/) about the conversation Jonathan Goodwin and I were having over at [The Valve](http://thevalve.org) in its entirety?  Am I intent creating the dullest trackback ever?  Might "Shameless Self-Promotion" be a shamelessly unironic category?  No.  I reproduce it in its entirety (and append to it responses by Y.T. and Some The Real Canadian Guy) because some readers of this blog _don't read the Valve._  Difficult to believe, I know, but some readers insist they have coursework, grading, cooking, cleaning, bathing and a number of other terribly unimportant chores which prevent them from reading it.  So for the benefit of some readers who will, I hope, take this gentle admonishment in the spirit with which it is made, I present McCann's initial post:
A few days ago in a thread that followed one of my posts, Jonathan
and the admirable A. Cephalous got into an interesting debate about
disciplinary distinctions.  (See their posts [here](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/writer\_in\_chief\_a\_bleg/#772), [here](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/writer\_in\_chief\_a\_bleg/#773), [here](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/writer\_in\_chief\_a\_bleg/#775), [here](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/writer\_in\_chief\_a\_bleg/#776), [here](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/writer\_in\_chief\_a\_bleg/#778), [here](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/writer\_in\_chief\_a\_bleg/#780), and [here](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/writer\_in\_chief\_a\_bleg/#790).)
Though the issues got a full and frank airing, I think they’re
too significant to let them just fade away amid a pretty much unrelated
discussion.  So this is my bid to resusciate the disagreement and
open it to other players.  (Sorry guys.  I don’t mean
to be poking a stick in a hornet’s nest or anything.  I
thought it was an interesting conversation.)

The gist of the debate comes down to the question of what weight to give disciplinary boundaries. 

Jonathan’s position appears to be that we should begin with
the presumption that they’re invidious.  As he puts it,
“The disciplines in the humanities and social sciences are only
administrative conveniences.” A. Cephalous argues that a lot of
what parades as “interdisciplinary” work is substanceless.
Quite often, he suggests, it doesn’t depend at all on an effort
to bring together the knowledge and perspectives prevalent in different
academic specialties.  He sees rather cherry picking, or one field
scoffing at the other in the guise of critique.  

Props are due [the headless one](http://acephalous.typepad.com/)--along,
of course, with his interlocutor--for commenting so seriously about
what is, I agree with him, a big problem for literary study. 
It’s not hard to see some merit to both positions here. 
Jonathan is surely right that academic disciplines are professional
associations with built in interests in defending their turf--and that
patrolling those boundaries easily can become narrowing and even
irrational.  But Aceph is also surely correct that not all such
complaints are merely credentialism.  There are bodies of
knowledge and wisdom built up in academic disciplines that, even as
they may need stirring up, can’t reasonably be treated with
cavalier dismissal.  

I think Acephalous is on surest ground when he suggests that the
problem that concerns him is not so much a lack of expertise as it is a
sheer lack of interest.  If, e.g., Gayatri Spivak invokes
psychoanalytic accounts of human psychology, but can’t be
bothered to explain why they’re superior to, say, behaviorist
arguments, then the problem isn’t so much that she lacks
expertise as that she doesn’t really care about the question of
which models are superior. 

But that’s not my main concern here.  I want rather to draw
attention to Acephalous’s suggestion that bad interdisciplinarity
is a hallmark of current literary studies in particular.  I take
it that Jonathan would doubt that this is the case, but I think the
headless one has got a real point here.  If he does, why so? 
What is it about literary studies that has led it to the pass where a
cri de coeur like Aceph’s seems not just possible, but
inevitable?

My inclination is to say that a lot of the problem is actually due
to the history Jonathan highlights.  The postwar academic
professionalization of the humanties has produced many an unfortunate
consequence, one of which has indeed been an obsession with methodology
and expertise.  But because modern literary scholarship is also
profoundly indebted to romantic aesthetics--and in that vein to the
idea that the literary imagination is a power superior to all
classification--a weird synthesis has resulted.  Literature became
the discipline that specializes in doubting disciplines, the specialty
that surpasses all specialization, the anti-scientific science, etc. 

That paradox--or just plain contradiction--shows up in the New
Criticism, with its stress on both rigor and the superior wisdom of
poetry, but it’s also apparent when say the advocates of [Cultural Studies](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0415903459/qid=1115146611/sr=1-1/ref=sr\_1\_1/102-5180286-9483348?v=glance&s=books)
cast it as “aggressively anti-disciplinary,” even as they
invoke several “major bodies of theory” (“from
Marxism and feminism to psychoanalysis, poststructuralism, and
postmodernism”).  This is not “codification,”
they stress, but something closer to “alchemy.” It’s
also apparent when the, er, [practitioners of New Historicism](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0226279359/qid=1115146841/sr=1-1/ref=sr\_1\_1/102-5180286-9483348?v=glance&s=books)
defend their own determined theoretical salmagundi as an effort
“to subvert a programmatic analytical response” in favor of
a “quasi-magical” encounter with “the real.” To
characterize what these two programs share as charitably as possible, I
think you could say that both seek to use expertise against
itself.  What’s being described isn’t so much
scholarship as avant-gardism as it’s been [classically defined](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0816610681/qid=1115147436/sr=1-1/ref=sr\_1\_1/102-5180286-9483348?v=glance&s=books). 
The aim is less to build knowledge than to undermine the institutional
boundaries that divide art from life.  In keeping with this goal,
the purpose of theoretical eclecticism isn’t really to draw on
diverse bodies of expertise; it’s to undermine (or perhaps better
to trump) the grounds of that expertise altogether.

Jonathan, I assume, would endorse at least something of that
program.  I’m more of A. Cephalous’s mind.  I
think the references to alchemy and magic above are not
incidental.  In my view, much of the pretense to
interdisciplinarity in current literary studies doesn’t reflect
an admirable broadening of the terrain, but an addiction to an old and
doubtful notion that literature surpasses and casts doubts on all other
forms of knowledge.

Some The Real Canadian Guy replied:
Whenever people talk about literary critics crossing disciplinary
boundaries, I’m reminded of Plato’s Ion, in which Socrates
grills a hapless rhapsode about what exactly he’s an expert
of.  Socrates questions him about a series of topics represented
in Homer’s poem.  Are you an expert in Chariot
Driving?  No.  Medicine?  No.  etc.  Finally,
he gets Ion to admit that in fact he doesn’t know much about
anything and that he’s merely an irrational, inspired
ranter.  I think that John Bruce, in his discussion with Sean
McCann in that last thread, maybe thought of literary critics in this
way.  Although John Bruce was certainly no Socrates.

Anyhow, the obvious response to this dialogue is to argue that
literary critics are in fact experts in literary form and rhetoric, and
thus Ion is perfectly justified in talking about Homer’s
representations of chariots, medicine, the art of war, etc., without
knowing much about any of these things.  But few critics, with the
exception of the New Critics, have been fully satisfied with this
solution.  Even the New Critics weren’t, at least not the
early New Critics.  I.e., think of John Crowe Ransom or Allen
Tate’s various rants about scientific theory, the economics of
the South, etc., none of which either of them really knew much about.

My point is that straying into other disciplines is inherent in the
practice of literary criticism itself.  However, Acephalus is
absolutely right that it leads to an immense amount of BS - Spivak,
Bhabha, all of the other familiar bullshit artists of the
academy.  There isn’t a good solution to this, except that
critics have to make sure that they actually immerse themselves in the
topics they write about.  I.e., they should immerse themselves to
the point where they can actually talk intelligently with a person of
the field they are straying into without sounding like too much of an
idiot or alien from outer space (literary critics sound this way when
they talk about Lacan to psychologists, for whom Lacan is an absolute
nobody).  This means that literary critics should also have a
certain degree of humility when they stray into other fields - i.e.,
not assume that because they’re trained in Derrida, etc., that
they automatically have access to a “critical
understanding” of economics, psychology, sociology, etc.,
unavailable to people in those fields.

Since many of the points I would've welcomed into my response had already been wined, dined, and spirited away to Canada, what follows ain't what it could've been but ain't all bad:
I think Blah has a point that the debate is largely evidentiary, but
I don’t think we can simply determine the state of the field with
a quick count of how many interdisciplinary projects are “done
well” and how many are “done poorly.” Consider
Randall Knoper’s [“American Literary Realism and Nervous ‘Reflexion’"](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american\_literature/v074/74.4knoper.html),
in which he argues that “Scholarship has not attended to realist
writers’ interest in sciences of the brain and nervous system or
explored the effect of rapid developments in neurology and brain
biology on these writers’ conceptions of mimesis.”
I’d consider Knopper’s a legitimate interdisciplinary
project, not only on its face but also because it unseats the results
of what I’d consider an illegitimate interdisciplinary project:
“My history here of the intersection between literature and
neuroscience in the late nineteenth century is offered partly as a
rethinking of American literary realism, in order to put back into the
cultural configuration that includes literary realism the physiological
psychology that was more or less dashed from view in the early
twentieth century by behaviorism and psychoanalysis.” Knopper
aims to correct 60 years of psychoanalytically-inflected
interpretations of realists’ mimetic claims.  Do I need, as
Jonathan suggests, credentials/expertise in _fin de siecle_
neuroscience to evaluate Knopper’s claims?  Perhaps. 
But I don’t need credentials/expertise to recognize that
Knopper’s discussion of pre-Freudian theories of
“unconscious cerebration” is productive of facts about the
realist movement; whereas a psychoanalytic account would be productive
of a psychoanalytic account of what critics now think the realist
movement was _really_ about.  In short, some
interdisciplinary work produces information about the object or objects
studied; other interdisciplinary work produces information about, well,
about the ways in which a given theoretical apparatus produces
information.  A Freudian interpretation of a C.P. Gilman novel
won’t tell you a lick about the novel itself, but it’ll
tell you more than you’d like to know about the conclusions
Freudians draw when confronted by a C.P. Gilman novel. 

I second Sean’s claim that the teleological nature of
“theoretical ecclectism” is largely to blame for the worst
examples of “interdisciplinary” work.  To draw from _American Literature_ again, Herbert Spencer himself would blush at the number of teleological references Sharon Harris stuffs into [“‘A New Era in Female History’: Nineteenth-Century U.S. Women Writers."](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american\_literature/v074/74.3harris.html)
All the “complementary” work she discusses
“advances” the field; but it can be advanced further still
if scholars “looked at women’s implication in and
resistence to nineteenth-century imperialism, colonization, and empire
building.” She’s no doubt correct that more work needs to
address, say, popular and literary responses to the Spanish-American
War; but consider the pretext for her admonishment: “Look! 
There’s a new interpretative apparatus in my field!  It must
be built upon the last!  We should adopt it!  What?  We
haven’t adopted it yet?  Why not?  Adopt already! 
ADOPT!” The assumption behind her claim is that postcolonial
theory should be brought to bear on the study of nineteenth-century
U.S. women writers _because it exists_.  Not because
it’s methodologically sound, mind you, but because it’s
there; and if it’s there it’s meant to be there; and if
it’s meant to be there, it must be an advancement. 
Harris’ (otherwise smart and informative) article demonstrates
how deeply buried an evaluative determination about the appropriation,
applicability and actual use of methodologies from other disciplines
is, not to mention how powerful whatever it is that binds theoretical
ecclectism to old school intellectual teleology is.  (Think I
could chock-a-block more _being_ into that sentence?  Next time I criticize someone’s prose feel free to shout “kettle Kettle KETTLE!")

I’m interested in that “whatever it is” I mention
above because I’m not entirely sure I understand, um, what it
is.  I don’t know why the uncritical adoption of a
methodology originating outside literary studies is so damn viral
within it.  It’s as if the enthusiam your Intro. to
Philosophy professor created about whatever philosophical system he or
she tabled that week has become a professional mandate.  Just as
the Kantians of Week 9 would embrace Hegel in Week 10 without having
the background necessary to understand the implications of dispensing
with the old or adopting the new affiliation, so too do many
self-proclaimed “interdisciplinary critics” adopt
methodologies they’re unable to defend and unfit to practice only
to discard them in favor of another methodology they’re unable to
defend and unfit to practice.  

So I wrote all that, pasted it into an email, let it simmer in my inbox
for a while, and realized it still doesn’t say what I want it to
say.  But I’ll put it out there anyway because it says a lot
of what I want to say.  Only not particularly well _and_ incompletely.

 **UPDATE:**  All parties involved in the initial discussion have since posted again.  Ain't that exciting?
