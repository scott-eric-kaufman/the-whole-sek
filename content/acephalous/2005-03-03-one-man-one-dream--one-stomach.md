## One Man, One Dream... One Stomach

Who wants to see [_Crazy Legs Conti_](http://crazylegsconti.com)?  The [International Federation of Competitive Eating](http://ifoce.com)'s efforts to mainstream the sport are paying dividends.  First Takeru Kobayashi's three-peat in Nathan's Annual Hot Dog Eating Contest attracts national attention, and now the [13th](http://www.ifoce.com/rankings.php) best competitive eater in the country--a man whose only victories came in the 2002 Big Easy Eat-Off and the IFOCE's official pancake-eating competition--is the subject of a documentary that's bound to bring the sport the same national prominence _Spellbound_ brought to the world of competitive spelling.  

"The thrill of victory..."

Some--foremost among them [Alan Young](http://web.ionsys.com/~remedy/All%!c(MISSING)ompetition%!s(MISSING)teeped%!i(MISSING)n%!m(MISSING)oral%!a(MISSING)mbivalence.htm)--believe there's something disconcerting about the inevitable popularity of competitive eating.  He finds it troubling that "there is a federation dedicated ot the promotion of this activity.  Competitive eating is morally problematic in a world where the hungry vastly outnumber the comfortably full."  But does Mr. Young stop there?  No, it's not the _eating_ of competitive eating that bothers him... it's the _competitiveness_.  "In fact, all competitive practices are steeped in moral ambivalence.  Winning a contest has little to do with moral achievement."   Not that he doesn't have a point--the introduction of a competitive element into things that ought not be competitive, like sports, games, and the real world--can cause a debilitating sense of loss in the morally-sound and aptly-named "losers."  Defeat is defeating... but winning makes a person feel like a "winner."  The Toronto Star really found itself a winner in Mr. Young.  I'd applaud its balls-out approach to selling papers, but the complement would undoubtedly fall flat on  Canadian ears--after all, hiring writers with brains instead of ones who've been brained would be so capitalistic, so crass, so competitive and, well, so _American_.\*

\*Full disclosure: I'm friends with a member of the IFOCE.  For the record,  [Leon "Justice" Feingold](http://www.ifoce.com/eaters.php?action=detail&sn=34) is a morally responsible human being.  Not at all the sort of amoral monster Mr. Young describes.  How can you dislike a man who  "has solid perfomances in matzo balls"?  (Few sentences parse funnier.)
