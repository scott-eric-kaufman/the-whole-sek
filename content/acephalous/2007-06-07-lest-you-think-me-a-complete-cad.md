...I should note that while I won mere approval, Adam [placed an article in an important journal](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2007/06/big-other-now-sees-me.html), which is worthy (enough) of an independent congratulatory post.  I raise my (imaginary) stein to you, Mr. Kotsko.  Good show, my man, good show.

I'd like to digress a bit because I heard you're into Sci-Fi...

For all the Kubrick (and IPhone) buffs out there:

A new spoof video making use of 2001: A Space Odyssey recently came out, and there's a mild amount of interest in the site itself: [http://www.myiphonerevolution.com](http://www.myiphonerevolution.com)

The video spoof itself is fun, but it would appear that there's an even more compelling reason to check the site out...

The guys who made the site are now calling for a contest for people to make their own viral videos!

I can't wait to see what people can come up with.

I realize I've been remiss in not thanking you for this post -- so, thank you.

Also, you should really check out this viral video thing.
