Any car rental companies in the Corona and/or Ontario area that would
 like to shame Hertz are more than welcome to contact me via Twitter [@scottekaufman](https://twitter.com/@scottekaufman), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/scotterickaufman), or scotterickaufman (at) gmail (dot) com. I will return your call within the hour.

**UPDATE:**  Nothing as yet, really, so it's time to go Full Jew:

Maybe if enough people "like" and "share" the following, some 
important person will notice their blackberry's been barking at them for
 hours  now.

Hi [Hertz](https://www.facebook.com/hertz?directed\_target\_id=0)!
  Remember me? I'm the deaf guy your Ontario, CA employees mocked this  
morning. I spent the better part of the day talking my way up from one  
middle-manager to another and was PROMISED that I'd get a call "later"  
from someone with the authority to 1) answer my very simple, basic  
question and 2) explain to me why Hertz employees are encouraged to  
behave as they do. (Do you WANT to drive away customers? Because I don't
  see that being a successful long-term business model.)

Point  being, I'm supposed to pick up my SUV tomorrow morning, but as
 I told  every rung on your corporate ladder, I refuse to honor my 
reservation if  the people who willfully and maliciously dishonored me 
today are  working the counter. I've asked for assurances that they 
wouldn't be,  but have heard nothing. I've asked for an explanation as 
to why they  were allowed to do so in the first place, but I've heard 
nothing.

Basically, I've heard nothing except "later," and now "later" is  
creeping into "tomorrow." Should you ever again desire the business of  
the communities to which I belong -- deaf and hearing alike -- I  
strongly recommend that someone with the ability to address my concerns 
 contacts me sooner rather than "later."
