## If I were Stephen Greenblatt, this would be one of <em>those</em> anecdotes. [Updated]

There's a very British ambiguous sign on my bathroom door:

[![Manchester day one 014](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0133eca6a7d6970b-500wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0133eca6a7d6970b-popup)

[](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0133eca6a7d6970b-popup)My sentiments exactly: if your fire alarm's so sensitive that steam sets it off, you have a crap fire alarm.  After a hot shower this morning, though, I discovered that British steam does in fact activate things.  In my case, it activated a love letter to a woman named "Christy" that some previous occupant had written on the bathroom mirror:

[![Manchester day one 009](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01347fd69b50970c-500wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01347fd69b50970c-popup)   
Not entirely clear there, I know, but if you look down from the light, you can spot the curves of the heart and the first letter of "Christy."  The whole thing reads "I [heart] you more Christy B," and the relative "more" suggests that I've intruded on a conversation in my own hotel room.  

Per the title, were I Stephen Greenblatt circa 1985, I'm sure I could do something astounding with this travel anecdote; since I'm me, I was merely a little freaked out to exit the shower and be confronted by someone else's love letter.

**Update.**Now my phone line's dead, which can mean only one thing: I'm being haunted by a very pathetic ghost.  He snuck into the bathroom and declared his love for "Christy," and now he's cut the phones.  I suppose I should be very frightened, but this room is as quaint as it is small.  The worst he could do to me is, I don't know, turn off the kettle so I can't make hot tea.

Was there any suspicious crud in the shower stall?

Wow.  I never knew another country's steam could have such special properties.  I now want to experience steam from around the world.

Where would Britain be without steam? 

I hope you enjoy the old place. My favourite (telling spelling) sign is: "Bicycles chained to these railings will be removed."

The cultural difference that made me laugh the hardest when I was in England was that the soda cans warned, "Best served chilled." Only the British would need to be told that.

Look out for that British steam!  It has different physical properties from the US variety...

There's a very complicated explanation, but suffice it to say that it _boils_ down to using the SI units...

(swidt?)
