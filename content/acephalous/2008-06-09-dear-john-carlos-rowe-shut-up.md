## Dear John Carlos Rowe: SHUT UP!

Some of us don't have tenure yet.  This is completely uncalled for:
In _Connecticut Yankee_, Twain warns the reader that the United States is already following the lead of the European imperial powers, a message he would repeat with growing volubility in his anti-imperialist writings from 1898 to 1905, **_most of which require little interpretation_**.  (_Literary Culture and U.S. Imperialism_, 139, emphasis mine.)

You are an evil liar, John Carlos Rowe.  You may have total recall.  You may be right charming.  I may even respect you mightily.  That changes nothing.  This is beyond the pale.  Don't believe me?  Ask anyone without tenure and brace yourself for a brutal what for.  Fact:

_**Everything**_ requires _**loads**_ of interpretation.  _**All of it**_.  (_**Even that**_.)  

Just because you have tenure doesn't mean you can give up the gig.  Some of us still have to slog through six sets a night.

OMG!! I did not think academics spoke to each other in such a way!! I have always been led to believe that when we academics do not agree with another we write a paper and publish it!

I am currently deep in constructing my graduate thesis proposal and I ran across your link. Okay you made me laugh! I do believe that sometimes academics think that everything said and written is so important! We all tend to forget that the academic discourse really is not that important in the scheem of all the worlds problems and the crisis that we as Americans are facing!

Thanks for giving me an early morning chuckle!!
