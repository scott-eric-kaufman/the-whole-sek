[_[X-posted](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/syllabus\_bleg\_poetry\_social\_crisis/)._]

As her name suggests, The Little Womedievalist lives in the sparsely
populated academic “ghetto” known as “medieval studies.” (A wonderful
place to visit, but I didn’t want to live there.) Thing is, when
medievalists tip-toe into the 15
th
 Century, they’re often
paralyzed by the unfamiliar literary landscape.  “Whither my rigid
poetic forms?  And feudalism!  What have you people done with
feudalism?” Medievalists are confused, nay, _mortified_ by the shiny baubles and the steam which periodically issues from them.  

So sometimes they need us soon-to-be-unemployed/forever-unemployable
modern-types after all, like when they want to write a syllabus on “The
Poetry of Crisis.” Below the fold you’ll find The Little
Womedievalist’s skeletal syllibi.  Lots of war, lots of plague.  The
word “pandemic” appears no less than _seventeen_ times.

She’d appreciate any advice that’ll help her “flesh it out.”  (O how quickly our dead metaphors are enlivened!)

“Introduction” from The Penguin Book of First World War Poetry, ed. and
intro by Jon Silkin (on reserve). [Though we won’t be covering all of

the critical questions and issues we want to ask about the poems we
will be reading during weeks 4 and 5.]

**Weeks 4 & 5 (War, Rebellion, Unrest, Protest)**

Michael Drayton, “The Battle of Agincourt”  (ERP 261)

Advise away!  C’mon!  You _know_ you love nothing more than
poking holes in other people’s syllabi.  Normally all that effort goes
for naught.  Here, you have a chance to make a difference.  Go for it! 
What are you waiting for?  Act now before your influence expires!

What a wonderful idea for a course! I \*wouldn't\* have gone and criticized anything here, but since you ASKED, here are some suggestions, mostly on the Renaissance end.

"Late Massacre in Piedmont" - gah. Not a great sonnet. I'd recommend either of Milton's two sonnets on Cromwell instead (and if you wanted to work in "When I Consider" or "Methought I Saw" under the personal crisis category, so much the better. (Just trying to make my boy Johnny M. look good, here.)

For Donne, I'd probably do a couple of the Hymns or other devotional verse rather than/in addition to the Holy Sonnets: "Hymn to God My God in My Sickness" and "Hymn to Christ at the Author's Last Going into Germany," esp.

And how about Lovelace, "To Lucasta, Going to the Wars"?

And for "formal crises," Herbert's "Jordan (1)" or "Jordan (2)" are both good.

On a non-Early Modern note: what about Auden? His "September 1, 1939" got emailed around a lot in the wake of 9/11, although obviously it's about a quite different war, and "Stop All the Clocks" would also be good for the section on mortality.

Lowell also seems like he should be in here. "For the Union Dead," perhaps?

And in addition to Sassoon, you might consider Rupert Brooke. His poems haven't aged well (and were probably always overrated), but they might be useful for just that reason--as a response to war that doesn't seem as useful or authentic to us any more.

Okay, that's enough from ME. Good luck--and I'd love to see the final syllabus, whenever it might be complete.

For modern disaster, Carolyn Forche has a sexy anthology called something like "Against Forgetting" that pretty much covers everything bad the 20th c had to offer. Her own stuff on El Salvador in \_The Country Between Us\_ is very important too (although I grow exhausted trying to imagine teaching the nuances of mid-70s El Salvador to post-9/11 college students).

For Irish potato famine, Chris Morash has a good anthology, as well as an earlier book on styles of poetic commemoration of the famine that would be a great cheat-sheet to teaching some of the stuff. Eavan Boland has some stuff on the long view of Ireland's tragic side in \_The Lost Land\_. 

For Depression-era disasters that led to labor movements, Muriel Rukeyser's "Book of the Dead" is pretty much indispensable.

Ooh, what an excellent idea for a syllabus.  First, I just wanted to say: way cool, Little Womedievalist!

Second, what about:  

 - Wulfstan's "Sermo Lupi" for the war/rebellion/unrest section  

 - Steinbeck's _Grapes of Wrath_ (I know, obvious and high school-y, but can you do the Great Depression/Dust Bowl without it?)

Third...I work on 15th century texts and I'm pretty sure I'm a medievalist.  Then again, I was sure until today.  Maybe I don't live in the ghetto after all!  Woo-hoo! :)

Get ready for the obvious, because a few famous poems came to mind that would be wonderfully suited.

First of all, Langston Hughes' "Harlem," for social and political crises. ("What happens to a dream deferred? [...] _Does it explode?_)

Also, for crises of conscience, "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" by Eliot. ("Should I, after tea and cakes and ices / Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?")

On the French Revolution: Wordsworth's "...Tintern Abbey." 

So, like I said, famous poems, but not less affecting for it. Though much is taken, much abides. 

Thanks for putting out the call! This was fun.

Oh, for heaven's sake, Wikipedia, when time is short and anthologies scarce, don't mislead me.

The Wordsworth poem is "The French Revolution, As It Appeared..." and not "Tintern Abbey."
