At the request of a reader who found it difficult to get in touch with me, I have added my email address back to the "[About Scott Eric Kaufman](http://acephalous.typepad.com/about.html)" page.  I'd removed it a while back when some foolhardy souls were signing me up for every single conservative listserv out there in the hopes that maybe if I read _[WorldNetDaily](http://www.wnd.com/)_ on a regular basis, I might be persuaded by what passes for argument over there.  [Never](http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=109113) [gonna](http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=108899) [happen](http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=108895).

Should you want to contact me, I can be reached by email at ****scotterickaufman (at) gmail (dot) com.  

You are also welcome to [add me as a friend on _Facebook_](http://www.facebook.com/scotterickaufman) or [join the official _Acephalous_ fan page](http://www.facebook.com/scotterickaufman#/group.php?gid=4683279156&ref=ts) on same.  (I have no idea what purpose the latter serves, but I'm sure I'll find a use for it someday.)  Finally, you can try to add me on _Friendster_ or _MySpace_, but you'll fail because I don't have accounts with either.

So ends the most boring post in the history of this blog.
