## PEDs for PH.Ds (or What I Knowingly Knew and When I Knew It or Not)

I testified before Congress today about the rumors that I've been using performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in order to complete my dissertation this quarter.  I spoke as [clearly and directly](http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/02/clemens\_makes\_bid\_for\_golden\_d.php) as my conscience and Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination allowed:
My relationship with myself is close enough to know that if I would have
known that I had done the Adderall, which I now know that I didn't know that I did, and if I was knowingly
knowing that I had taken the Adderall, I would have talked to myself about the subject. I'd have come to me to ask me whether I knew or would know the effects of it.

I wouldn't have used the Adderall to finish my dissertation if I'd knowingly known I'd be called before Congress to testify about when I knew what I know.  Had I _knowingly_ knew nothing, I wouldn't have chosen to abuse the Adderall I never knowingly abused.  Since I only _unknowingly_ knew, I can say with absolute certainty that I neither knew nor know nothing about whether I abused the Adderall knowingly or not.  

I don't even know whether I finished the dissertation while abusing the Adderall or if I abused the Adderall while finishing the dissertation or whether I finished the Adderall while not finishing the dissertation.  Could go either (or any) way.

Is it possible that someone put some flaxseed oil in your Obama milkshake?  Think plausible deniability.

You'll laugh out of the other side of your mouth when you're stripped of your Nobel Prize.
