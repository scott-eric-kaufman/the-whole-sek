I want to keep the preface short and snappy because I'll be linking to it in the sidebar someday, but for the record, I can't believe how much I write (do it daily and it just _accumulates_) nor how much happened to me last year.  For some reason, I thought last year was largely drama-free, and it was . . . except for all the drama.  (I'll save my meta-thoughts about Proust and journals for another day.)

That last one is sad. Condolences. We have 5 of the beasts. Luckily ours are immortal and we won't have to be gutted one day.

Is this arranged in rank-order of funniness?  Because if so I'll note that, funny though the 'Jew-in-Queue? Shoo!' post is, I laughed more at 'Dawh we is Underscrewed'.
