As those of you on Facebook already know, a couple days ago I noted that "after months of recommending I befriend strangers, Facebook now thinks I know people I actually know."  New algorithms and what-not.  But here's the kicker: not only does this new algorithm identify people I actually know, _it definitively pins down the identity of my stalkers_:

[![Ohmymy](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156fca0ac8970c-500pi "Ohmymy")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156fca0ac8970c-pi)   

This time with arrows:

[![Ohmymy02](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011570bf4b0a970b-500pi "Ohmymy02")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011570bf4b0a970b-pi)

Wow.

That is the best, bar none, argument for joining Facebook that I've ever seen. 

I think a minimalist approach to this is best: just the fact that you've noted the material sends a sufficient message. Unless there's been more activity over the last two years and we should be forming a commenters' posse, in which case, sign me up!

Christ. I can already tell that this isn't going to end well. Husband, respect the stalker and tame the donut.

This is going to be great for our rap album. Before you do anything rash, we need to lay down a couple of tracks that can be leaked on the internet. That way, when the news reports come out, we'll already be googlable.

Casper, Casper…isn't this the guy who I advised you not to keep engaging with, because he was getting more and more angry at you and his options for expressing that were diminishing?  Or was that some different internet lunatic that you just had to try to talk sense into?

Tomemos, I don't think so.  The conversation happened with him over the course of an hour one night; the legally actionable harassment that followed lasted for months, extending out from the university into local and state politicians, with him throwing every last ounce of shit he had in the hopes that something would stick.  Putz politicians being putzes, some of it did, for a while, and required tedious explanation on my part.  Didn't matter that he lobbed these charges anonymously, some idiots saw the hand grenade and assumed I'd thrown it.  I've been told I have a clear case of harassment against him should I ever be able to identify him definitively, and now through some algorithmic magic involving, I assume, Spencer Ackerman blogging at FireDogLake, I've got him nailed.

'Listen to your wife' is always good advice, and particularly so in this case.

On the other hand, if you're hoping for more personal misery so as to have a good stock for future blog posts, then going after the goon might be worth contemplating.

Did he have an account on Facebook called John Caspar or did Facebook magically unearth his name out of nowhere?

No, no, no ---- are you waving a red flag in front a bull here? You don't want to draw attention down from somebody you already have a restraining order against. And you aren't thinking that facebook will release its top-secret, proprietary algorithms so that you can prove to the police you are being stalked and harassed, are you? 

Do like I did when my creepy ex or creepy department chair showed up in my suggested friend pile: click on the little X by him on the far right side and just have done with it.

Wait, you already have a restraining order against the man? I thought you were in the dark about the particulars of his identity until you saw this on FB. -- does this mean you were able to get a restraining order against "The person posting on FDL as The Ghost of ..."? Or if not, what does the FB identification add?

Well, I definitely remember giving you that advice about someone who was throwing the kitchen sink at you, and who got more incensed every time you posted about him.  I remember, actually, that when I posted that advice on an entry, the entry disappeared later that day, which I thought might have been a sign that you were following my advice.  But maybe it was just a technical error, or maybe I'm misremembering this whole thing.  Do you remember this at all?

Anyway.  If that was John Casper, my advice stands.  If it wasn't, then that is just more evidence that the confrontational approach works to get crazies to harass you.

Whether or not you have a good harassment case is not the issue.  The issue is, how can you keep this guy out of your life?  Even if you believe that intervening in someone's life can change their behavior—pretty dubious, I'd say—it seems clear that calling attention to John Casper isn't going to do it.  If he didn't want attention, and a fight, he wouldn't have launched his crusade in the first place.

Security consultant Gavin de Becker, in his book _The Gift of Fear_, says that as a rule of thumb, every time we engage a stalker, we buy ourselves another six weeks of contact.  He also says that, in many stalker cases, the stalked begins to have something in common with the stalker: neither wants to let things drop.  The stalked becomes committed to making the stalker pay, changing the stalker's behavior, etc.  But as de Becker points out, changing a harasser's behavior is nearly impossible, whereas changing the way that behavior affects us—by not reacting to it—is, if not easy, much more doable.

I recommend de Becker's book, by the way—to anyone, but to you especially.

What would be neat is if you could finally, finally convince Facebook to add an "Add as Enemy" button.

SEK: I've responded to all your emails, dunno why you're not seeing my replies.  I'll try from a different account, a bit later.

_Did he have an account on Facebook called John Caspar or did Facebook magically unearth his name out of nowhere?_ 

He has a Facebook account where he's linked to a few of the prominent liberal bloggers --- you can guess who --- so his name just magically appeared because Facebook thinks we could be friends.  

As for what I'm doing, well, nothing for the moment.  I tried, but never successfully scored, a restraining order against him because I couldn't identify which "John Casper" he was.  He lorded this fact over me, basically taunting me for being unable to figure out which extremely white "John Casper" in Wisconsin he was: "HA HA!  I can harass you and you can't do jack shit about it!  HA HA!"  

He did that shit for a solid month straight.  RAGE.  But that was a long time ago, so what's really gratifying here is the knowledge that were he to pull a similar stunt again, I could nail his ass to the wall in a heartbeat.
