*   I am not the [Director of Health Care Ministries at the Church at Pinnacle Hills](http://www.betweensundays.com/?p=516).   I don't believe [the Christmas Truce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas\_truce) really happened.   Nor do I believe the guy who purchased the letter claiming otherwise is [the same](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas\_truce#Christmas\_Truce\_Letter) [Chris de Burgh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris\_de\_Burgh) whose song "Say Goodbye To It All" [.[mp3](http://acephalous.typepad.com/ChrisDeBurgh-SayGoodbyetoitall.mp3)] haunted my childhood.   (I don't recommend you listen to that song.  It's beyond awful.  My rebellion was so pathetic as to barely register as rebellious.)
*   I am not this handsomely-named guy [writing at HNN](http://www.hnn.us/articles/47143.html).  I haven't written a [biography of Rosalynn Carter](http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/kauros.html), nor do I know whether Carter's experience in the White House is in any way analogous to Hillary Clinton's.  However, I do agree with my namesake on one front: Clinton's accomplishments in seven years of service approximate what Obama's mustered in a mere two, and I think that critically undermines Clinton's claims that her "experience" trumps his.  (Not that this'll [satisfy Ari](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/02/09/id-like-your-help-please/).)

I don't know why you wouldn't believe in the Christmas Truce: it's a reasonably well-documented historical moment. Given the difficulty of documenting _anything_ (unofficial) in wartime, it would have to have been a substantial event for so many oral testimonies to have survived.

I admit that I'm biased on this, because my first exposure to the story was [John McCutcheon's "Christmas in the Trenches"](http://folkmusic.com/record/r\_live.htm#Christmas), so it's pretty deeply ingrained on my soul. Unlike your namesake, however, I don't believe it says _anything_ about the mystery of Christ.

I know it's been a while since we've seen each other, but I found [this through a Google image search](http://www.mindonfire.com/images/scott.png) for "Scott Kaufman."

I remember you being...hairier, I think.  Also, you wore less lipstick.

What Ahistoricality said, including the John McCutcheon part.  Why do you hate Christmas so?
