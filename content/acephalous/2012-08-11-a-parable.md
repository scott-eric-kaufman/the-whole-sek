_It's fourth down and seven with two outs in the bottom of the ninth of the Super Bowl of Sport. COACH ROMNEY calls a timeout._

**COACH ROMNEY:** Brees, I'm going to have to take you out.

**DREW BREES:** Why Coach? I'm just about throw a strike-out on the winning drive!

**COACH ROMNEY:** I know you throw your throws at the appropriate height, but this is just too important. We need to be winning this sport.

**DREW BREES:** But I _am_ winning it!

**COACH ROMNEY:** I mean we need to be _[winning](http://www.vulture.com/2011/03/charlie\_sheen\_glossary.html)_ it. (_Sends BREES to the bench and signals to the bullpen. Enter TIM TEBOW_.) I trust you know what to do with this.

**TIM TEBOW:** Run it to left outfield for a touchdown!

**COACH ROMNEY:** Exactly. Let's go win this sport!

**TIM TEBOW:** Jesus Christ!

**JESUS CHRIST:** I want no part in this.

**COACH ROMNEY:** Of course you do. You're our new power forward!

**JESUS CHRIST:** __Jesus Christ.

**TIM TEBOW:** Jesus Christ!

_How will the World Series of Sport end? I don't know either. But I guarantee it'll be entertaining._

BTW, I'm no Charlie Sheen fan, but if \*someone\* (SNL?) doesn't cast him as R-Money before this is all over, Western Civilization is lost.
