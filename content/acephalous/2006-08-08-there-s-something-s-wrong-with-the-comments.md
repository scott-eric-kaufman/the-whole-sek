For example, I can't leave any.  I don't know what's up with TypePad, but I've already complained.  Twice.  (By which I mean, "an hour.")  ("If they're lucky.")  ("And I'm bored.")  ("Which I am.")  Suffice it to say, they've blocked my number.  So I'm putting my response to y'all's links and responses on hold until I can, you know, respond to them.
