“Please don’t shoot yourself in the face!”

“You think I won’t shoot myself in the face? Because I will!”

“I know you like to [shoot people in the face](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry\_Whittington) but please don’t!”

“I’m gonna!”

“Why would you?”

“You left me no choice!”

“This is my fault?”

“[Your commercial](http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/08/priorities-ad-ties-romney-to-lost-health-insurance-131276.html) made me look like a bureaucrat with the sensitivity of a serial killer!”

“Shooting yourself in the face will change that how?”

“It’ll show that I care!”

“So it’s like ‘Bam!’ You care!”

“Damn right! Oh Bam! I care!”

“O Bam! A care?”

“What did you just say? [Shit](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79482.html)!”

That's only the most important one. No reason for TypePad not to break it.
