## Do [conservatives] dare to eat a peach?

Two groups of people are annoyed that the administration collaborated with the _Huffington Post_’s [Nico Pitney](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tag/iran-liveblogging) on a question about Iran: [seasoned](http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0609/A\_question\_from\_Huffington\_Post.html) [pool](http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0609/Obama\_calls\_on\_HuffPost\_for\_Iran\_question.html) [reporters](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/roughsketch/2009/06/the\_president\_packs\_the\_press.html) invested in the pecking order who believe Pitney jumped the line, and [partisan](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZWU0YTZlNjcxN2EyZTVjMmFiZDAwMzk3OGJhMmQ4ZjM=) [hacks](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/06/24/obamateurism-of-the-day-63/) whose concern for Iran disappears the moment an [opportunity](http://wizbangblog.com/content/2009/06/24/wapos-dana-milbank-blasts-the-obama-show.php) [to denounce](http://cayankee.blogs.com/cayankee/2009/06/the-obama-news-conference-desperate-to-control-coverage-obama-plants-questions.html) [the](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2009/06/pitney-asked-his-arranged-question.html) [media](http://michellemalkin.com/2009/06/23/obama-hand-holds-huffington-post-blogger/) [arrives](http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/wp-content/themes/instapundit\_iran/images/permalink.gif).

As to the former, they are, to paraphrase [Tim Crouse](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812968204/diesekoschmar-20),
journalistic Prufrocks who measure their lives in handouts, and Pitney
had the audacity to receive more sooner than this collection of easy
tools thought prudent. More significant, or at least more revelatory,
is the response of those who have spent the past week full of high
sentence, but a bit obtuse on the subject of Obama’s refusal to condemn
Iran. They pressed Obama to use the word “condemn” itself, because any
condemnation that doesn’t sets off their [Neville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neville\_Chamberlain) detectors. No mere objection, they argue, no matter how strong, can rise to the level of a condemnation.

Now, in their mad rush to demonstrate the pervasiveness of liberal
bias, they ignore the rather obvious symbolism the Obama administration
employed here. At a moment in which the Iranian regime is doing its
damnedest to prevent information about the situation on the ground from
leaking, Obama grants an Iranian dissident the primacy of place in a
news conference that will be broadcast the world over. Moreover, he
calls attention to the fact that he’s breaking protocol _in order to give voice to the very people the Iranian regime wants silenced_.

With the whole world watching, Obama took a moment to humiliate
Ahmadinejad and Khamenei. But because conservatives are compelled to
follow their tedious argument of insidious intent to its tendentious
conclusion, what should be a story about the regime being humiliated on
the world stage becomes yet another media pseudo-scandal.
