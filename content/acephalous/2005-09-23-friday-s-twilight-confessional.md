## Friday's Twilight Confessional

I confess that the [Ninth Ward](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/23/AR2005092301437.html) once terrified me and that my friends who lived there knew it did.  I confess to concocting excuses to meet them somewhere other than the Ninth Ward.  

I confess that last night I had countless nightmares about my parents or friends being [caught in their cars on the Interstate 10](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/22/AR2005092200536.html) as they fled from Rita.  I confess that the sleeplessness these nightmares caused had a deleterious effect on my ability to welcome and introduce my students to [Literary Journalism 20](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj20/).  (I also confess that a massive overcompensation effort is already underway.)

I confess that whenever I think "the situation cannot deteriorate further" [it invariably does](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/23/AR2005092300505.html) and that I feel an irrational irresponsibility for it.

I confess that I am even more tired of thinking and talking and [writing](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/differences\_wit.html) about [hurricanes](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/hurricanes/index.html) today than I have ever been tired of thinking and talking and writing about anything that is not my dissertation.  I confess that this thinking and talking and writing about hurricanes has lowered the odds of my finishing the Jack London chapter by Monday to a pathetic 23 percent.

I confess that this confession began as a comment on [Kotsko](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/)'s "[Friday Afternoon Confessional](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2005/09/friday-afternoon-confessional-jared.html)" and that despite my atheism I have found confessing cathartic.  (I also confess that I did not know that outside of Aristotelian literary theory "cathartic" refers to "the evacuation of the bowels."  I confess I find the metaphorical leap disturbing.)  

I confess that I have searched the archives of Adam's [Weblog](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/) so that I might learn more about his faith because faith confuses me.  I confess that while I wish I could experience faith I am more frequently of the opinion of 19th Century philosopher and arch-evolutionist Ernst Haeckel, who in _The Riddle of the Universe_ (1899) said that modern theology "adores a personal God as an invisible—properly speaking, gaseous—being, yet makes him think, speak and act in human fashion [and] gives us the paradoxial picture of a 'gaseous vertebrate.'"  (I confess that my monism and materialism often depress me ... but that the alternatives depress me even more.)

I confess I want to end this confession with a bang but must settle for a whimper ... because I confess the delirium with which I taught this morning is nothing next to how nebulous my thoughts are now.  Finally, I confess that said bang concerned what I need in my _nécessaire_ and why I find [this portrait of a "confessant"](http://www.artrussia.ru/magazine/120902.jpg) compelling.

My close friend lived in the Ninth Ward and made it out safely, only having been mugged once (and she [accidently] beat up her mugger).  But I think she was mugged in the Bywater or whatever.

I've always hoped that the Friday Confessional would disseminate itself beyond "my" site.

I fear you're going to find my remarks on faith (assuming you do find such remarks) to be rather confusing and contradictory.
