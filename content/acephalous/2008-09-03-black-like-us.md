If [this story](http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-09-01-diversity\_N.htm)
is correct, and of the 1,790 delegates to the Republican convention
only 36 are black, then the Liberal Media of the United States of
Hollywood gave face-time to _44 percent_ of the black Republican delegation during Giuliani’s speech.

That is to say, in an effort to demonstrate the blinding whiteness of the Republican Party, the evil MSM (a.k.a. CNN and MSNBC) cut to the faces of _.08 percent_ of Republican delegates during the fifteen (or so) minutes Giuliani spoke.\*

I think conservatives can rest their case.

\*Which reminds me of a joke David Cross made when he performed at the
Irvine Spectrum Center: “I love that they call it the ‘Spectrum
Center.’ It contains all the colors of the rainbow from white to … also
white.”

You neglected your decimal point there. The media actually cut to 0.8%!o(MISSING)f the delegates.

See? The MSM is 100 times more reasonable than you thought.

Blame yourselves, Democrats. You're the ones who came up with the notion that diversity is about skin color, not ideas.
