I would appreciate it if everyone would hate on:

1.  [Mr. Bady](http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/) for sharing [this](http://slacktivist.typepad.com/slacktivist/2008/09/manuel-mets-sus.html).
2.  Mr. Manuel and Mr. McCain for making it possible.

Let's say that a woman earned an average of $3.70 per hour over the course of her long blue-collar career. That included 40 years of working at least 5 days of menial labor each week. She kept that money in a bank, and now after 7 years of retirement, she has a little nest egg and Social Security. 

Because of problems in paying the mortgage or any of a thousand family emergencies, she needs money. She gets caught up in an on-line scam. There goes 40 years of sweat and her semi-secure future. The linked author empathizes with everyone but our hypothetical woman. 

Is it the story of the Great White Hunter on an African Safari or is it the story of Robin Hood? Is there such a thing as a vigilante when national and international police agencies will NEVER catch the scammer? I find it hard to believe that you can take the law into your own hands when there is no enforceable law.  

P.S. That Pudd'nhead Wilson book you have out is overdue by a week. That'll be $1,800.00 for late fees, fines and the new bailout surcharge. Don't make us have to send out Rocco again. Warmest Regards, The UCI Library System

As the linked blogger, I want to respond. However, I don't want to leave my trash scattered all over SEK's front yard, so I've posted that comment and my response over on my own blog. Plus, anything I can do to lure some of the UCI library's hatred away from his presence is probably a good thing, right?
