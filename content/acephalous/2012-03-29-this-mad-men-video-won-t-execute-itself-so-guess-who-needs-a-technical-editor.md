I could've done this no problem on my now defunct computer, but on this new one, with these new programs, I'm basically incapable of doing anything that doesn't transform the Windows equivalent of this:

In a giant red X which resembles, well:

And because I don't have a team of dirty Italians to help me take him down, I wonder whether﻿ I haven't acquired myself a video editor capable of making this short﻿–and I must say inspired cultural connection–and teaching me how to make it work like it ought﻿ to. Because right now it looks like this:




 

Smooth up the transitions, make the words hit their marks, and we'll have ourselves a brand new meme, all the way back from olden times, before anyone was aware of Internet traditions.

So technically, you'd earn nothing but good will, but karma's karma, no?
