## A Sign More Revision May Be Necessary

Shortly after five this afternoon, I sat at my desk re-revising Saturday's talk.  I  remember being satisfied with my re-wording of the final sentence of a paragraph, but unsure how to effect a transition to the next.  

I leaned back, considered my options ... and promptly fell asleep.  

Friends, the situation is dire.  My own talk lulls me to sleep.  I'm the most receptive audience alive for my material, yet even I can't resist its soporific spell.  I have no choice but to "jazz it up."  Cue [the music](http://acephalous.typepad.com/the\_pogues\_-\_1st\_peel\_session\_041784\_-\_02\_-\_danny\_boy.mp3) [.mp3] and start the show:

				 Big-Tooth belongs to the Folk, the moderately advanced of the novel's three populations _and he is awesome_:

The Fire People, the most culturally advanced of the groups "were
less different from [the Folk] than were [the Folk] from the Tree
People. Certainly, all three kinds were related, and not so remotely
related at that" _and were always ganging up on Big-Tooth_:

They would attack when he least suspected it:

And they never came alone:

'Cause they knew Big-Tooth could take 'em in a fair fight:

But the Fire People weren't interested in "fair."  They preferred the advantage of numbers:

So Big-Tooth would flee to fight another day:

Still soporific?  I think this is much better, but as the deadline for AV  requests was in July, I'm going to have to pull some strings to pull it off ... and I'm not sure I can handle that much pulling.  But you do what you must for your art, right?

I am completely and utterly confused. (but wide awake, so perhaps it works.)

And I like ducks! --- maybe I should steal that pic.

Definitely keep the cats and the ducks. 

Okay keep the LARPers too.
