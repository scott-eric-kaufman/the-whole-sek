The [comments](http://www.haloscan.com/comments/farlio/5744657638484919703/) on [Farley’s post](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/02/aye.html) about grade inflation and student effort had convinced me not to read [the __ article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/18/education/18college.html) that inspired them.  Then [Shahar excerpted](http://pervegalit.wordpress.com/2009/02/19/student-entitlement/) a different part of the article and I changed my mind:

A recent study by researchers _at the University of California, Irvine_,
found that a third of students surveyed said that they expected B’s
just for attending lectures, and 40 percent said they deserved a B for
completing the required reading.

Did that prepositional phrase modify the researchers (they are _at_ UCI) or where they did their study (_at_ UCI)? 
I couldn’t tell from the excerpt.  So I read the article.  It didn’t
say.  So I read the study it cited.  It didn’t say outright—but _it hinted_.  The ethnic diversity of its sample breaks down like this:

51.2%!
(MISSING)
East or Southeast Asian

18.9%!
(MISSING)
Caucasian

10.7%!
(MISSING)
Latino

1.1%!
(MISSING)
African American

The ethnic diversity of a [closely related fine public university in a similar location](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/about/) breaks down like this:

51%!
(MISSING)
Asian / Pacific Islander

24%!
(MISSING)
White

12%!
(MISSING)
Latino

2%!
(MISSING)
African American

Participants in the study were recruited through handbills “posted at the Social Sciences Human Subjects Laboratory.”  [Where do I teach](http://www.classrooms.uci.edu/GAC/SSL162.html)?  This means that [while](http://www.metafilter.com/79283/Is-it-time-to-move-beyond-grades) [everyone](http://joannejacobs.com/2009/02/19/great-expectations/) [else](http://chrisblattman.blogspot.com/2009/02/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-bs.html)
can speak hypothetically about whether their students resemble those in
the study, I must come to terms with the fact that sixty-percent of _**actual students actually sitting in my actual classes**_ believe that if they “explain to [_me_] that [they are] trying hard, [they] think [_I_] should give [them] some consideration with respect to [their] course grade.”  I must accept that fifty-percent of them** __ **believe that they deserve a B if they “have completed most [_of the mandatory_] reading for [_my_] class” or “have attended most [_of the mandatory_] classes for [_my_] course.”  I must deal with the fact that twenty-five percent of them “would think poorly of [_me if I_] didn’t respond the same day to an e-mail [they] sent.”

I could learn to deal with that.  But I’m not sure I can live in a world in which _sixteen-percent_ **** of my students think that I “should not be annoyed with [them] if [they] receive an important call during class.”

I'm shocked that these students have such poor ideas about how to game the system.  Most profs couldn't care less whether your attendance is spotty if you ace the midterm and final, but the opposite is not true.  And cramming for two tests is a lot easier than dragging yourself into class every day.

I wouldn't worry about it. I bet most of the students who responded to the survey were only copying from the kid at the next desk anyhow.

Some of us are not so easily fooled: a class which involved just a few tests and in which the material covered in class wasn't necessary would be.... well, typical in the psych department, but quite unusual in history or literature.

The study was completed last year. Why report on it now? Because it's a perfect opportunity to confect a morality play pertaining to the "economic crisis" (ie, depression) the US faces. Predictably, people will be horrified. What about "personal responsibility"? And of course what this means is that the fact that such a response from students is entirely in keeping with the logic of the culture which surrounds them will be lost. Let's go back to Theodor Adorno for an insight:

 "What has become alien to men is the human component of culture, its closest part, which upholds them against the world. They make common cause with the world against themselves, and the most alienated condition of all, the omnipresence of commodities, their own conversion into appendages of machinery, is for them a mirage of closeness. "

The root of the problem, then, is not ungrateful or cynical students gaming a bankrupt system, but the society which makes such activity seem necessary. IN a world modeled after the market-- which is, in a word, false-- is such falsity surprising?
