(_Quick note: if you think someone is being self-congratulatory when he conjures up an image of himself with floaties, you may want want to have your tone-o-meter examined.  Just saying._)

I’ve a long history of [wading](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/on-kc-johnsons-.html) into [hostile](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/more-on-kc-john.html) [waters](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/07/more-on-the-men.html) [without floaties](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/refined\_white\_s.html) and I’ve no intention to stop doing so, but if I ever did, it’d be because of statements like “[I see no difference presently between the terms democrat and progressive](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13228#comment-533553).”  Or claims that almost-imperceptibly-left-of-center candidates are [socialist, communists, Marxists, &c.](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13200#comment-528920)
On the entire internet, this conceptual sloppiness is the only thing
that ever threatens my equilibrium.  Stupidity I can handle.  Ignornace
doesn’t bother.  Willfully ignoring what I’ve said will only earn you
my titular [faux-Hulk](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13200#comment-528856).  But play fast and loose with categories and you’ll piss me off so much I’ll have no choice but to ignore you.

Revising my dissertation, I think I’ve come to understand why: in my
“professional” life, that’s all I do.  I define, re-define, pre-define,
counter-define, retroactively define, retroactively re-define,
retroactively pre-define, retroactively counter-define, &c.  The
dissertation has taught me to put items in proper boxes _because almost no one will be able to tell when you don’t_. 
Items and boxes entail a responsibility people who put Obama in the
Marxist box (or Ayers in the Leninist box and Obama in the Ayers box)
don’t understand, except unlike shifting London from the Darwin to the
Spencer box, the actions of irresponsible bloviators have a measurable
impact on our lives.  Stuffing [Palin in the feminist box](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13228)
allows a host of anti-feminists in as well, as evidenced by the past
week of Republicans in deep dudgeon over the “sexist” attacks on the VP
candidate.

My metaphor, on the other hand, teeters on actual sexism, so I’ll
stop while I’m behind.  Wait, can’t stop there either.  I don’t mean to
say that there were no sexist attacks on Clinton, or that there haven’t
been sexist attacks on Palin.  I’m simply saying the hypocrites who
crow about “sexist” attacks on Palin care not one whit about sexism _per se_
— that is, had McCain not tapped Palin, conservatives would’ve avoid
women’s issues for the forty-fourth Presidential election in a row.

Let's see: I float my cursor over the links and see proteinwisdom.com over and over.  Why are you bothering, Scott?  Do you have liberal's disease?  How much evidence do you need in order to conclude that it's a worthless blog with an intellectually dishonest poster and a host of commenters who think that "yah he's socialist, he's a commie" is the height of argument?

For the sake of sanity you have to be willing to give up on certain people who have proven, over and over, that they don't want to think.  At this point, that includes everyone remaining in the Republican party.  Sure, their actions have to be dealt with, just as we have to deal with the next hurricane that rolls up to Louisiana, but you don't have to waste brain cells trying to fit their confused mush of garble into proper boxes.  You can't make them be coherent, because they don't think.

  Bottom line.

  Almost half of O!'s supporters think that judges should  ignore the Constitution, and go by what they "feel".

  Great idea!

  See you in the Socialist Republic of the United States in a few years.

  I guess I was lucky enough to have graduated before the proggs hi-jacked our schools. Before history, economics, and civics were banished to the hinterlands.

  Why?

  Because any one of those three would let our children know just what a bunch of power tripping dolts are trying to take over this country, and how specious their arguments are. Where in the Constitution does it say that government can tell you _what to eat?_ And you proggs will destroy everything this country has ever stood for.

  FACTS! But they have no bearing on the progg reality. It's all "How do you feeeeeeel?"

  Be careful what you wish for, it's liable to come true.

  I see equality of opportunity, you seem to see equality of misery - OH! EXCUSE ME! Equality of outcome. I have screwed up many times in my life, _but it's nobody's problem but mine! I can stand on my own two feet, and will, no matter how much I screw up. "Oh! Please save me, Mr. Government!_"

  Absolutely ridiculous, and an idea that flies in the face of history.

  Oh! But I forgot! The proggs _this time_ will get it RIGHT! Because they are so much smarter than any of the billions of people who have lived before them. 

  Forget Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Hitler, and all the others who have killed hundreds of MILLIONS of people.

  You are so much smarter. History has no bearing here, right? WE ARE THE PINNACLE OF HUMANITY!

  Baloney. You are a bunch of egotistical clowns who think that you are smarter than anyone else.

  Well, you ain't. And if you get what you think you want, you will regret your "holier than thou" attitude.

  You guys are _so much smarter than they were!_  

 This time, you'll get it right, and only have to kill a few hundred thousand people who refuse to accept your fascist state.

   Happy ground hog day, stupid.

  Oh. And BTW.

  The reason sarah Palin scares the bejeebus out of the left is that she is exactly the woman that they have been braying about. 

  Unfortunately, her political orientation does not please the "feministas" (or should I say "Pisses them off because she is not a whiner?) who have been begging for a strong and intelligent woman like her. To bad she believes in taking care of herself and her family.

  She doesn't fit the progg template, and in trying to destroy her, the idiots have driven way, way, many people into McCain/Palin's arms.

  Get your lawyers ready. A thousand lawyers, and a progg judge might give you a slim chance of stealing this election.

JD and The Lost Dog are my sock puppets, I have to confess; I wanted everyone to see exactly what kind of people hang out at proteinwisdom.  I may have overdone it a little bit though.  Too stereotyped, do you think?
