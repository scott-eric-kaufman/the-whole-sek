## "I have no literary interests; something else: I am made of literature."

So wrote Kafka on LF 304 and BrF 444.  No, I don’t know what those mean either.  Princeton only posted Stanley Corngold’s [introduction](http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8791.html) to _Franz Kafka: The Office Writings_,
so the citations function as cryptic references to private files
collected, collated, duplicated and made available to people in the
employ of a vast bureaucracy.\* (Apt, ain’t it?) Corngold likes to pair
the titular quotation with nonce word from Br 384 and L 333: _Schriftstellersein_, which he translates here as “the being of a writer,” but [elsewhere](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/daed.2007.136.2.79?cookieSet=1) [.pdf] as “the condition of being a writer."\*\*  

His intention, here as at that elsewhere, is to create a continuum between Kafka’s _Schriftstellersein_ and his _Beamtensein_,
or “official self,” that is, between the literature he scratched out
between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. and the sanctioned documents he produced at
the Workmen’s Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. 
Intuitively, this seems as sound as “Petition of the Toy Producers’
Association” sounds like it could adorn one of his short stories. 
There’s a catch: 

Kafka didn’t write “Petition of the Toy Producers’ Association,” but “Petition of the Toy Producers’ Association _in Katharinaberg, Erzgebirge_,”
a title whose specificity ruins its effect.  It’s a document Kafka
never distilled, never labored over as he did his literary work.  Not
that he wasn’t an able lawyer: on 26 November 1912, he won a settlement
of 4,500 kronen on behalf of the Institute, but he did so on a
“maddening trip to Kratzau” (_LF_ 64).  Why “maddening”?  Because it’d interrupted the proper composition of “The Metamorphosis”:

This kind of story should be written with no more than
one interruption, in two ten-hour sessions; then it would have its
natural spontaneous flow . . . . But I haven’t got twice ten hours at
my disposal.  So one has to try to do the best one can, since the very
best has been denied to one. (_LF_ 64)

Obviously, Kafka’s emphasis is formal, not rhetorical here--the _flow_
of the story shaped by experience of its composition--but that’s my
point: when Kafka stood before the District Court of Kratzau in
November 1912, he read a document he’d written to persuade the Court to
settle in his favor.  It’s no more literary than the fifty-three
letters he’d written Felice Bauer in November and December 1912 to
persuade her that he would visit, couldn’t visit, wouldn’t visit, must
visit, will visit never mind won’t visit her that Christmas.  (That’s
undecidability in action, folks.\*\*\*) Not that it isn’t important.  As
an historicist, I value the documents in the same way I value the
letters.  But I don’t understand the desire for equivalence here.  

Kafka may’ve written _about_ and _on behalf of_
bureaucracies, and there’s no small amount of interest in the
intersection, but that’s no reason to collapse one into the other. 
This isn’t like David Foster Wallace’s [notes for _The Oxford American Writer’s Thesaurus_](http://blog.oup.com/2008/11/writers-thesaurus/),
which are aimed at writers composed in his signature stylistic quirk. 
Or is it?  Talk me down, people, lest I flatten every last bit of word _by_ a genius _into_.  [That way lies madness](http://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/2008/11/04/41138/).

Sometimes I play coy.  So shoot me, but then consult--if you can brave the German--_Briefe an Felice_, ed. Erich Heller and Jurgen Born.  (Cowards can try their hand at _Letters to Felice_, trans. James Stern and Elizabeth Duckworth.)

A distinction of interest to hardcore Heideggerians, no doubt, but me not so much.

Not really.

I happen (bravely) to have Briefe handy. There's a bit of context (which I also remember the introduction to The Basic Kafka mentioning). A graphologist (at his boarding house) suggested, based on his handwriting, a bunch of things that (if my German suffices) Kafka balks at. Including the idea that he might have "an interest in art". His answer is, essentially, that he doesn't have an _interest in_ literature (i.e., art), he is _composed of_ literature. He is an artist and can be nothing else. Now, he may just be posturing, but if he is right then the argument that that petition is a work of art hold. When he wrote it, he could have been nothing other than an artist.

Perhaps it is Kafka's desire for equivalence that is most interesting here.

shouldn't that be "a historicist"?

I just ran across a great line in a [NYT review of Bolaño's _2666_](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/books/review/Lethem-t.html?pagewanted=all)

"a passion for literature walks a razor’s edge between catastrophic irrelevance and sublime calling."
