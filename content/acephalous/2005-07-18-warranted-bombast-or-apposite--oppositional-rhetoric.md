## Warranted Bombast? Or, Apposite & Oppositional Rhetoric

I’m a fan of [_American Literary Scholarship_](http://www.dukeupress.edu/als).  So much so I have a [complete set](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/home/home\_1.jpg)
(atop the shelves on the left).  When the latest edition arrived,
I scanned it 1) to check if someone else’s written my
dissertation yet and 2) to ensure that my notion of where the
field’s headed is more accurate than not.  (For those
interested: my dissertation’s still mine and only a minor
course-correction’s needed.) I’ve read all the sections
relevent to my work and I have but one complaint: the rhetoric.  

I’ll focus on Michael J. Kiskis’ otherwise excellent
round-up of “Late-19th-Century Literature,” but this
inflated rhetoric peppers the entire volume.  Kiskis’ review
opens thus:

The scholarship produced during 2003 is a complex mix of
perspectives and materials: in the host of essays and books we see
evidence not only of the end of the _academic apartheid_ that
relegated women and minority writers to the margins but also a greater
awareness of the intricate relationship between genre and challenges of
aesthetic and political intention and result. (275, emphasis mine)

Now, I should say that the presence of that rhetorical bombast
doesn’t diminish the intelligence or comprehensiveness of
Kiskis’ review.  That said, doesn’t the appellation
“academic apartheid” 

1) trivialize the consequences of historical apartheid
and, in so doing, participate in the same logic of marginalization it
wants to denounce? 

2) needlessly needle those critics who choose to work on canonical or semi-canonical authors?

3) create the impression that the field, as currently constituted, is almost perfect?

Three sentences later, Kiskis condescends again: “We are growing out of separate spheres; we are finding our way to an _adult appreciation_
of complex and compelling literary and cultural meaning”
(275).  Earlier critics apparently lacked the maturity necessary
to cultivate an “adult appreciation” of “literary and
cultural meaning.” The insult’s implied but easily
deduced.  

Now, I’m compelled to note that I’m satisfied with the
direction of the field, as the course Kiskis charts is one in which
ever more emphasis is placed on the historical context of literary
works.  However, even though I belong to Kiskis’ intended
audience, I still find his self-congratulatory magniloquence as shrill
as it is unnecessary.
