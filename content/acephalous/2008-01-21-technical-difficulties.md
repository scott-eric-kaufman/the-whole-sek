## Technical Difficulties

Anytime I try to go online I'm informed that "UCI has received a complaint regarding an alleged case of copyright infringement which specifies [my] IP address."  

The problem concerns Vista—which I'm forced to run on my new desktop, since I no longer "own" the copy of XP installed on my laptop—a couple of items I (legally) downloaded ages ago, and some security settings or eLicense controls (depending on who you ask).  

As I'm having to borrow the internet cable from someone currently using it to communicate with her students, until I resolve this issue (tomorrow) my online presence will be hit-or-miss.  (I'll be [doing](http://crookedtimber.org/2008/01/19/a-goldberg-conjecture/#comment-224933) [the](http://crookedtimber.org/2008/01/19/a-goldberg-conjecture/#comment-225119) [hitting](http://crookedtimber.org/2008/01/19/a-goldberg-conjecture/#comment-225146) _thank you very much_.)

But!

I hope to have this all resolved very shortly (tomorrow) and begin posting Very Seriously Intellectual items about funny books.  I'm team-teaching a unit on Alan Moore's _Watchmen_ the next two weeks for a course on the rhetoric of heroism.  You're to be my test audience.\*  

More shortly (tomorrow).

\*Awkward phrasing, I know, but far better than what I first wrote: "You'll get the dry runs."  This is what happens when you don't post for five days.  All dissertation and no play makes SEK a poor writer.

(shakes head) if it's not one thing, it's another, heh...

So, you got a teaching gig? Awesome. Does that mean you're Doctor Acephalous already? And, if you are, and were to walk in commencement, then where would you put the silly hat? 

Inquiring minds want to know.

I see we have [similar associations](http://www.roughtheory.org/content/scratchpad-the-greatest-difficulty-no-kidding/) (er... referring to the image, not the post that contains it...)...

No teaching gig or doctorate, Sisyphus -- I'm guest-lecturing at the wife's "Rhetoric of Heroism" class. _Sigh_.  Soon enough, though, soon enough.

N.P., _Indeed_!  That's one of those phrases that epitomizes all that is wrong with catchy phrases -- they come to replace thought with _procrastination_, instead of transforming the latter _into_ the former.  (Or somesuch.)

"dry runs" sounds painful, but "test audience"...well, I'll bring caffeine.

Did you see the recent call for abstracts on 'Watchmen and Philosophy'?

Scott: have you considered recording your own version of 'Nobody Knows the Troubles I Seen'?

Nobody in Norway would dream of teaching a course on Watchmen. On the other hand, we have universal healthcare and sane politicians... but I would have liked to do a course on Alan Moore.

I know it's always tedious to have an evangelist at the party, but perhaps you should drop windows and go for [this](http://www.ubuntu.com/) instead. If you find that frightening, try [this.](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/01/21/wubi-install-ubuntu.html)
