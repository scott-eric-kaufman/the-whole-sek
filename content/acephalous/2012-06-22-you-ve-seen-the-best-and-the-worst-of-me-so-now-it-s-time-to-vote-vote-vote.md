## You've seen the best and the worst of me, so now it's time to ¡VOTE VOTE VOTE!

It occurs to me that I haven't done a "Best of _Acephalous_" collection [since 2008](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/05/the-best-of-acephalous-2008.html), which means that all my best material from 2009 to 2011 is just sitting there on the Internet, lonely and unappreciated. As I'm not wont to abandon perfectly decent material to the unknown algorithms lording over the most skidded of Google's rows, I think it's about time for me—by which I mean _you—_to figure out the best material I produced between 2009 and 2011. I've even made alluring icons to represent whatever you believe to be my best.

For 2009, [which begins here](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/index.html) and tracks the year after I earned my dissertation, I'm going with this:

[![You're a winner dr sek](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017615bb814c970c-500wi "You're a winner dr sek")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/06/the-best-of-acephalous-2009.html)

**[UPDATE: You can see a list of the "winners" by clicking on the image above or, if you're very lazy, [this link](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/06/the-best-of-acephalous-2009.html).]**

For 2010, [which begins here](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/01/index.html) and tracks my first year working full time while trying to hit the job market, I've come up with this:

[![Spring in academia](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef016767c606d6970b-500wi "Spring in academia")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef016767c606d6970b-popup)

My chances are so good! It's springtime! Just look at that tree! So for 2011, [which begins here](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/index.html) and must have gone better from a professional standpoint, I concocted this:

[![Welcome to the desert of the real](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017615bb85ec970c-500wi "Welcome to the desert of the real")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017615bb85ec970c-popup)

Or, like most candidates, I died a little inside. But pity me not! Just vote! Vote! Vote! Vote!

(Otherwise I'll have to re-read everything I've written over the past three years and will, inevitably, annoy myself by revising and tweaking ever single post. Save me the trouble, my friend, and enjoy your journey through my archives.)

I have to admit I'm a little nervous about what 2012's moniker will be. We're getting bleak...

I'm already scouting images of former nuclear test sites that contain bare skeletons, barren trees and the dessicated corpse of a beloved childhood character. You know, just to tie the whole thing together.

Chernobyl, maybe?  Lots of lovely overgrown, verdant landscapes.

Wouldn't be out of place, that's for certain.
