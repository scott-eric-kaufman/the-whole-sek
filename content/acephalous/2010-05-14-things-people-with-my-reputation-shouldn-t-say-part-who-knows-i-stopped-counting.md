In the unlikely event that you wondered why I haven't posted anything since Monday, it's not because I'm [in trouble](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/05/theres-a-proper-time-and-place-for-everything-but-right-now-and-in-here-is-neither.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef013480a549c4970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef013480a549c4970c) for [this nonsense](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/05/theres-a-proper-time-and-place-for-everything-but-right-now-and-in-here-is-neither.html), but because I've been grading, grading, grading, and shuttling 1) my wife and 2) the sooner-than-later [President of my professional organization](http://www.michaelberube.com/) around the Los Angeles basin.  All of which has been entertaining and edifying in the extreme, but not that good for the blog.  However, because I feel compelled to put something up here (and lack the energy to revise any of my drafts into something worth posting), I present to you the absolute worst way I could've told Bérubé that I was in my office and that I'd meet him in front of the library in five minutes:
**MICHAEL:** I'll be done digging in Richard Rorty's archives and finding incredible items that I reserve the right to inform my readers of myself at my discretion so don't reveal them in this post.

**SCOTT:** Sounds good!  I'm in [Murray Krieger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray\_Krieger), but will finish up in a second and meet you in front of the library.

That being [Murray Krieger] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kriegerhall.jpg)_[Hall]()_, whose top floor houses my office, but honestly?  I commend Bérubé for thinking highly enough of me not to connect those dots and accuse me of the awful things I sorta admitted to be in the middle of doing.

Hey, just because I've got a dirty mind doesn't mean I need to share ....

The construction of buildings that resemble something out the original Rollerball move, say an entity of the Energy Corporation, just should not be allowed.

I assume everyone that works in or around the building must dress the same, too?

Cheers!
