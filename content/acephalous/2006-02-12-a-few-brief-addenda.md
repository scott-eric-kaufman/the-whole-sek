## A Few Brief Addenda

Because the previous post may present an unsavory impression of Y.T.  I offer these addenda:

*   I'm not an anti-feminist in the contemporary or medieval sense.  Sure I try to force The Little Womedievalist to do the dishes all the time . . . but that's only because my fingernails have been "spongy" since the cancer and when they dry the tend to crack.  Down the middle.  Which _is_ as painful as you imagine . . . only more so. *   I'm no liar.  If a certain hostess of a certain annual Halloween Party were to stoop to admit to frequenting these parts she would confirm that I was mauled by a feline of unusual size . . . and that I bled all over everything I wore and touched and entered the general vicinity of.
*   Not that I want to sound overeager to prove my honesty . . . but I am in the unique position of being able to refer you to a [Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist](http://barry-siegel.com/) for more information about [my infamous morning](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my\_morning.html).  I've been investigated by the best.  And if you send him an email he'll tell you I'm 100 percent kosher.  I don't mean "Jewish" there even though I could.  If you want proof of my election I can upload an .mp3 of my Haftorah portion.  You heard me.  Don't pretend you didn't.  I _will_ upload audio files of my bar mitzvah to prove myself trustworthy.  (I feel obliged to note that despite being thirteen I gave a rousing reading of significance of [Sukkot](http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday5.htm) and the erection of the Tabernacle . . . and I didn't even laugh when I said the word "erection."  _Now_ if you want to brand me a liar . . .)

Was this the promised 'infuriating' second part?  Because you'll have to do a lot better than this to infuriate me, I don't mind telling you.  A _lot_ better.

Adam, the infuriating material was (it appears safely) buried beneath in the previous post.  The only way this would qualify would be if I'd written the opposite of what I had, i.e. that I had, in fact, invented it all . . . scratch that: that "I," in fact, were someone else's invention.  Possibly a whole team of someone elses.  I _could_ be the product of a think-tank, or public opinion polls _a la_ that co-authored Stephenson novel whose title currently escapes.  Then again, that wouldn't "infuriating" so much as "interesting," as in "if there's a whole team behind 'him,' it's interesting how 'he' isn't somehow, you know, better . . ."

Scott, gonna have to call your bluff on this one.  I'm fairly sure you were being facetious, but if not, I'm going to have to request that you upload that Haftorah Mp3.  My IPod catalog is short on Jewish rites of passage tunes, and this would be great for the treadmill.

Rousing rendition of significance of Sukkot, eh?

Either your memory is far more impressive than my own or you frequent temple more than I do.  I too became a (portly, vocally challenged, socially inept) Jewish man at the late age of 13, but my memory of this is, to the dismay of my parents, rather scant.

Mike, you should know bettter.  The first rule of Jew Club is: Never make a bet you're not [guaranteed to win](http://acephalous.typepad.com/haftorah.mp3).

But by such a _great_ song.  That makes up for it, no?

An appropriate response would be a link to The Who's We Won't Get Fooled Again, which is sadly absent from my collection.

Good song, Scott.  Not great.  Good.  But after perusing this link:  [http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/04/coerced\_congeni.html](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/04/coerced\_congeni.html)

...I see that our music tastes are very similar.
