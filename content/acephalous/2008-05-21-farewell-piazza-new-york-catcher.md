The home-brew video leaves much to desire—complete with a bad, but creative, misread of "well he may" as "Willie May," which [cluelessness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie\_Mays) I chalk up to the British being, well, [_British_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket)—but the song is catchy and apropos on this, [the day](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/21/sports/baseball/21piazza.html?em&ex=1211515200&en=c5d86dca51390949&ei=5087%!A(MISSING)) [the man himself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike\_Piazza) retired, so I slap it up anyway:

You're right that the video poster got it wrong, but you did get the pun, yeah? For anyone who didn't: "Well he may"=the Willie Mays statue at the San Francisco ballpark, where the song takes place.  I was stunned that a Scottish band could make a pun like that.

Grits aren't Dakotan, cricket isn't Scottish. They do have a team, but so does pretty much everywhere (including the USA), and they don't have 'proper' Test status. I think that most Scots are pretty content with that fact. And I credit them with the pun.

Funnily enough, I have frequent disagreements with my (North American) partner about whether or not words like 'piazza' and 'catcher' rhyme. Is she just mad or is this a general accent thing? This all originated with my amusement at the way she says 'pitta' -- pee-da compared to a British pih-ta -- and suggesting a restaurant chain called St. Pitta. I still can't believe she struck it down.

In case it wasn't clear: I think they rhyme.
