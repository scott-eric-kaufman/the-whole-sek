## In Memoriam: Jim Zwick

When I was writing my Silas Weir Mitchell chapter, I happened across Jim Zwick's comprehensive website on Twain and anti-imperialism.  So it should come as no surprise that when I started writing my Twain chapter, I sought out the [two](http://www.jimzwick.net/confronting\_imperialism.html) [books](http://www.jimzwick.net/weapons\_satire.html) Zwick had written on Clemens and anti-imperialism.  He and I exchanged a few emails and he was aggressively generous, sending me copies of a numerous documents I was having trouble laying hands on.  

Tonight I read Shelley Fisher Fishkin's email to the Americanist listserv informing us that he had [passed away](http://www.legacy.com/HartfordCourant/DeathNotices.asp?Page=Lifestory&PersonId=102231213).  I never met him, and I only exchanged a handful of emails with him, but let me say this: 

He was generous when he didn't have to be.

It may sound banal, but when you think about it, what better epitaph could a scholar wish for?

Very sorry to hear this.  He sounds way too young.

Jim Zwick was a scholar of the early years of the US Empire.  He researched the efforts of the great Mark Twain in promoting the mass-based American Anti-Imperialist League.  He was a good friend to my family and a friend of the Philippines.  Three things we surely miss in the US: Jim Zwick, Mark Twain and a popular anti-imperialist movement. Jim's example of combining scholarship with anti-imperialism should motivate us all.  Robin

I too often communicated with Prof. Zwick and I am proud to have done so. As a World War 2 veteran and now an anti-war activist I appreciate his articles depicting the days when U.S. imperialism took root after defeating Spain and taking over their colonies. Needless to say, we have been at war ever since somewhere in Asia.

I have just now found out who ran a website I returned to often - boondocksnet.com.  I was saddened to learn that the reason I cannot find it is the owner - Jim Zwick - passed away.

I was hoping someone might direct me to where I could access his many 3D pictures.  I use to peruse them for many hours at a time.  I hope his work has been carried on by someone somewhere.  My email is twobytwoarts@gmail.com if anyone has any information.

Thanks
