I might hazard a guess that you're perhaps having a week like mine... ;-P  Hang in there...  :-)

Then he almost fell flat on his face on the floor  

When he encountered more letters galore!  

Letters that he'd never dreamed of before!

The most appropriate quote from _On Beyond Zebra!_ seems to be:

"I've a letter called FLUNN. And the FLUNN is for Flunnel  

A softish nice fellow who hides in a tunnel.  

He only comes out of his hole, I'm afraid,  

When the right kind of softish nice music is played  

On a kind of a hunting horn called the o'Grunth.  

And to learn how to play it takes month after month  

Of practising, practising. Isn't much fun-th.  

And, besides, it's quite heavy. Weighs almost a tun-th.  

That's why few people bother to play the o'Grunth  

So the Flunnel's been out of his tunnel just one-th"

Lovely! Thanks for making a hard day of unrewarding labor a little more amusing. 

P.S. My Ma and Pa _thought_ they wanted to read my master's thesis, until they actually tried to do so and... got bored. Sigh.

Thanks Scott.

With only minor alterations (to G and L), I'm afraid to say that having landed the job, none of these have substantially changed.  But from isolative despondency comes either great productivity or unfortunate drinking habits.

UCI must have a really weird grading scale.

Funny!  But I don't get 'K'.  What am I missing? I thought that entry would fall under 'F', but you already had one there. - Tim

Odd that the "K" is so controversial -- certain members of the Kaufman household were also baffled by it -- but all I mean by it is the old copy-room standby:

"What are you doing?"

"Copying sample essays.  Here's the _A_, the _B_..."

"Which one is that?"

"The _K_."

If you like, I can pick on another letter.  For instance, I thought that O should have ended with -uck or -it or something of that nature; you know, so that the _[BLEEP]_s in P would actually seem like censorship.
