**[UPDATE #2 HERE](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/update\_on\_the\_s.html).**

**[UPDATE #1 HERE](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/refined\_white\_s.html).** 

That is the title of the letter "The Ghost of Adolph Rupp" sent to
members of the UCI community.  Seems I am now a white supremacist. 
That said, as someone who writes and comments under his own name, I'm
not particularly worried.  I comported myself on that thread as I
always do.  For the record:

I am _not_ a white supremacist, nor am I an _enabler_ of white supremacy.  I _am_ interested in the historical and rhetorical context of race in American culture.  (I've taught [two](http://www.ags.uci.edu/%!E(MISSING)skaufman/teaching/saved%!a(MISSING)s%!h(MISSING)tml/english%!C(MISSING)%!f(MISSING)all%20syllabus.htm) [courses](http://www.ags.uci.edu/%!E(MISSING)skaufman/teaching/saved%!a(MISSING)s%!h(MISSING)tml/english%!C(MISSING)%!s(MISSING)pring%20syllabus.htm) on the subject.)  And I _am_ interested
in the context of online rhetoric.  This particular thread fascinated
me because it intersects with many of my scholarly interests.  

But it will probably be the last time I attempt a discussion of
these interests online, because you never know when the person across
from you will decide it's time to notify your superiors that they have
a white supremacist among them.  (Even though they don't.)  

Although it will cause me personal inconvenience, I do hope the
people who received this email take it seriously.  Accusations of
hate-speech and race-based discrimination should be investigated, so
that when the complaints are _legitimate_ they can be dealt with
accordingly.  Just because someone took the time to craft an
inaccurate, slanderous letter painting me as white supremacist does not
mean that all such letters will be inaccurate and slanderous. 

Here is the text of his letter:  

"Refined white supremacy in a UCI Lecturer's blog comments"

The UCI lecturer's name is 
Scott Eric Kaufman. 

[http://www.ags.uci.edu/~skaufman/contact.html](http://www.ags.uci.edu/%!E(MISSING)skaufman/contact.html%!C(MISSING)2%!A(MISSING)0)

 

I informed 
Mr. Kaufman yesterday that I would be contacting UCI and I invited him to 
suggest names of people who he wanted included. Mr. Kaufman declined to respond, 
but he is copied on this email. 

Over the 
course of several days, Mr. Kaufman was vigorous in his defense that it was 
appropriate that **ABC affiliate** post an excerpt of this with a 
link:

_"_

_Death 
of A House Negro_
](http://sixmeatbuffet.com/archives/2007/06/03/death-of-a-house-negro/)  

_First Hogzilla II, now this?_

_Not to convert this 
place into the Dead Meat Buffet but an enormous amount of meat died this weekend 
and we’re all the better for it. It goes without saying that the term “house 
negro” gets bandied about with great frequency against anyone of seemingly 
African descent when they are on the Right. Be you Clarence Thomas, Condoleeza 
Rice, Michael Steele, or J.C. Watts, you can expect a Harry Belafonte, a Danny 
Glover, or yes - even a Steve Gilliard to call you out for being the race 
traitor that you are. The sell-out, Oreo cookies who do Whitey’s bidding and put 
a black face on racist policies that would otherwise be rightly called out for 
what they are. Uncle Thomas and Aunt Thomasinas alike._

_But really, who is 
doing whose bidding in those situations? Can Howard Dean call Condoleeza his “do 
right answer mammy who be smart”? Can James Carville call out Clarence for 
collard greens?_

_Which brings us to 
today’s marquee morbidity. The tragic, untimely death of Donk House Negro and 
all around bigot Steve Gilliard. Who knew that boiling bacon grease in a spoon 
and mainlining it into the neck vein was bad for your health?_

_Most people will 
remember him as the happy-go-lucky poster of this photo of Michael 
Steele:_

 

_How to 
win a seat at the Democrat’s table._

_The rest won’t remember 
him at all. The way it should be._

_Naturally, The Left is_

[
_draw big lips and

 _on black Republicans because they believe in individual 
responsibility or \*gasp\* lowering taxes._ 

_It won’t be hard to

The New York Times had a 
different opinion of Mr. Gilliard [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/06/us/06gilliard.html?\_r=1&oref=slogin](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/06/us/06gilliard.html?\_r=1&oref=slogin)

Mr. Kaufman reserved most of his attacks 
for a blogger, patiotboy, who had succinctly summarized the serious problems 
with an **ABC affiliate** hosting white supremacist language that 
was **explicity intended** to inflict injury and 
humiliation:

And Lynnster, Smantix isn’t 
working for an affiliate of a national television network. I have no hope of 
changing his behavior." 

 

Mr. Kaufman launched 
his support of white supremacist language on an **ABC affiliate** 
in his comments in a Thursday 7 June 2007 thread at patriotboy's blog. 
Patriotboy titled this thread: _"Getting Serious for a Moment."_ [http://www.patriotboy.blogspot.com/](http://www.patriotboy.blogspot.com/)

Mr. Kaufman commented under 
the pseudonym _"SEK."_  __Mr. Kaufman

 buttressed his enabling of white 
supremacist language by identifying himself as an "_academic."_ Mr. 
Kaufman frequently invited readers to his web site. His site unambiguoulsy 
identifies him as a UCI lecturer.  Mr. Kaufman repeatedly criticized all who 
disagreed with him, because _"we"_ did not properly understand the 
**_"context"_** of white supremacist language posted on an 
**ABC affiliate's** blog. Mr. Kaufman ignored numerous reminders 
that **ABC** and its **affiliates** transmit over 
**publicly owned** airwaves. Mr. Kaufman ignored reminders of Janet 
Jackson's "_wardrobe malfunction,"_ and Don Imus' characterizations of 
the Rutgers' Women's Basketball team. If Mr. Kaufman had not been so completely 
dismissive of so many who tried to point out that it was he, who was missing the 
wider _"context,"_ I never would have felt compelled to contact so many 
at UCI. Mr. Kaufman refuses to acknowledge that he has inserted himself in the 
_"context"_ of other acamedicians who have **enabled** white 
supremacy, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin\_Heidegger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin\_Heidegger)

.  

Mr. Kaufman assumes a 
middle ground with respect to the transmission of white supremacist language 
that does not exist. He is either actively educating against the massive 
ignorance that undergirds all "_white supremacy,"_ or he is 
**enabling** tolerance of it.  It's a zero-sum game and I think I 
am being kind to Mr. Kaufman, a Ph.D. graduate student, by referring to him only 
as an _enabler_. 

Dr. Quanbeck, among other 
things, I am requesting that you (and others copied on this) consider that Mr. 
Kaufman has already initiated a process which will pull UCI in his 
"_context."_ That's why I copied UCI's Development Office. I doubt that 
they are anxious to hear Mr. Kaufman's name on a fundraising call. I doubt Mr. 
Kaufman considered their _"context"_ when he lobbied so aggressively in 
favor of posting white supremacist language on an **ABC 
affiliates's** website.  

I have also copied Congresswoman Maxine 
Waters' Chief of Staff, [Mikael Moore](mailto:mikael.moore@mail.house.gov). I am sorry to admit 
that I was largely ignorant of what a rare gift Congresswoman Waters is to our 
great nation, until I began reading Jane Hamsher's blog, FireDogLake. I have 
also faxed a copy of this email to Alice A. Huffman, the President of the 
California Office of the **NAACP**. I have also copied the 
_California Universities Consortium,_ because they are committed to 
advancing diversity in California education. I am inviting everyone copied on 
this to share their assessment of Mr. Kaufman's understanding of 
"_context_" with Mr. Kaufman. It is my sincere hope that this 
"_sharing_" takes place  individually and institutionally.

I have also copied **UCI's student 
newspaper.** I hope they see fit to report on Mr. Kaufman's advocacy 
for white supremacist language displayed on an ABC affiliate. Another issue is 
that Mr. Kaufman appears to have a lot of time available for blogging. I suspect 
that a large portion of Mr. Kaufman's funding comes directly from the 
taxpayers.  I think a very wide spectrum of UCI students will be very interested 
in his understanding of "context."  I raised issues very similar to these with 
Mr. Kaufman on the thread and he repeatedly and explicity 
welcomed them.    

I also copied _"Ethics at UCI."_ 

Below, I have quoted some 
of Mr. Kaufman's routinely banal comments, but I would urge everyone to read 
his comments in their entirety. Bold is mine:

_"I'm interested in this 
affair for_ 
[
_other, 
call them "academic" reasons_
](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/panel\_podcast.html)
." [...]

_"Yes, random people can read it; 
however, random people should do their due diligence, as it is incumbent upon 
them to understand a statement before responding to it. (And yes, 
**context** is a vital part of understanding.)"_

I wrote this to Mr. 
Kaufman: _"You're enabling an incredibly vile example of refined white 
supremacy."_   

He responded: _"...Just because the **context** is invisible to you does not mean that white supremacy has been 
enabled." [...]_

Mr. Kaufman is also 
sickeningly quick to cast himself as the victim of _"bigotry_:" 

_"And is you bringing up 
that I'm from the South an attempt to score points with the members of this 
crowd who believe the citizens of Louisiana are sub-human dreck? What's with the 
odd bigotry against Southerners here?" [...]_

Here Mr. Kaufman criticizes 
me for not being more tolerant of an **ABC affiliate** posting and 
linking white supremacist language. __

_"I think I've made_ 
[
_my 
position clear here from the beginning_
](http://www.haloscan.com/comments/patriotboy/3947160929673603317/#422811)
_. In fact, before I was drawn 
into this idiotic pissing context with Ghost, I stated precisely_ 
[
_what 
horses I had in the race_
](http://www.haloscan.com/comments/patriotboy/3947160929673603317/#422830)
_. I have no position here to 
nuance, or to shift from, other than the simple fact that there was a 
miscommunication in context. The General admits as much. Why you can't let it 
go, Ghost, is beyond me." [...]_

This was Mr. Kaufman's 
first response **after** I informed him that I would be sharing his 
comments with UCI. 

_"And why, exactly, are 
you going to do this? Have I engaged in any sort of harassment? Have I in any 
way, shape, or form endorsed Smantix's vile obituary? As I stated from the 
beginning, I have an interest how online interactions are framed. People in my 
department know that. People at the university know that. You can re-inform them 
of it if you'd like."_

Later, he wrote this: 

_"You're going to inform 
my institution that I'm interested in the context of online interactions? They 
already know that. I presented on_ 
[
_this 
very topic_
](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/another\_mla\_pan.html)
 _at the largest academic conference for English professors a mere six months ago. 
Last month, I participated in_ 
[
_a 
roundtable on the same at UC Davis_
](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/the\_most\_import.html)
_. People already know I'm 
interested in the context of online interactions. I'm confused as to what you 
think you'd accomplish here. [...]_

_So what you intend, 
then, is to re-inform people in my department of what they already know? You can 
see why I'm confused." [...]_

_That said, I find the threat **childish,** but if you 
really want to follow through with it, I can't stop you. I'm sure people in my 
department will take the word of a dead basketball coach very, very seriously. 
(Or wait, will you drop the veil of pseudonymity and complain under your own 
name? If you do, I'll take the high ground and not reveal your identity. I'm no 
tattler.)_ 

Bold is mine. 

If anyone finds my concerns about Mr. Walker's position _"childish,"_ please email me. 

Dr. Quanbech, aside from your Office, I simply plucked email addresses very 
randomly off of UCI departments that I thought might be most sensitive to the 
**grave injury** that white supremacist language represents to the 
United States and the world**.** I would hope that those copied on 
this would feel very free to copy others on this email. . 

A sub-topic of my discussions with Mr. Kaufman included comments about 
_"refined"_ white supremacy versus other forms of it.  Again Mr. Kaufman 
was unwilling or unable to admit how much more lethal white supremacist 
language is when wielded by people who are highly proficient with respect to the 
use of language, or those that are credentialed by society, as teachers are. 

I would invite all copied on this to consider that the only lesson Mr. 
Kaufman may learn out of this is to not reveal his identity or place of work. 
I certainly hope that this can bring about some kind of _"conversion,"_ 
for Mr. Kaufman. In my opinion, he owes an apology to the family of Steve 
Gilliard. I would hope that Mr. Kaufman would find some way to make 
**substantial restitution** to people who have been injured by the 
kind of of refined white supremacist language that he wants posted on an 
**ABC affiliate**. There's no shortage of victims and I have found 
that apologies untethered by restitution tend to be ephemeral.

Oh geez.

"The Ghost of Adolph Rupp" now has to live the rest of his life knowing he actually took the time to send the laborious details of an online disagreement to someone's bosses.  He really, seriously spent precious moments of his time on earth to do this.

Hmm.  Maybe "pity" is the only appropriate response for me to have to him.

As do I.  Still, there's a stain attached to someone who acquires multiple mentally unsound stalkers.  People wonder whether they're really the issue, or whether it's you.

If they take it seriously, it won't take them long to decide his complaint is absurd.  This guy's bluster shows that he's taking it incredibly unseriously.  He cares more about the chance to make a stink than anything else.

Perhaps it's inappropriate to fixate only on the comedy here, but the throw-away link to Wikipedia's entry on Heidegger is hilarity itself.

Yikes. Thought I'd de-lurk to voice support ... call me naive, but the viciousness of all this is surprising, as is the effort taken in pursuit of the prize of your personal and professional destruction. I hope you're right that the letter-writing campaign doesn't make any waves.

This may seem a bit convoluted, but perhaps not quite as convoluted as the letter in question. Consider this: what you have here is a conservative student doing what he believes to be a parody of the 'hand-wringing liberal,' in hopes of making trouble for an instructor he considers to be far too liberal.

The first 'false note' that jumped out for me was: "I am sorry to admit that I was largely ignorant of what a rare gift Congresswoman Waters is to our great nation, until I began reading Jane Hamsher's blog, FireDogLake." (All that needs is a 'BWAHAHA' after it.)

If UCI has a College Republicans chapter, I wouldn't be surprised to find this fellow on the membership rolls.

"In law, defamation is the communication of a statement that makes a false claim, expressly stated or implied to be factual, that may harm the reputation of an individual, business, product, group, government or nation."

This letter's repeated description of your comments as "support of white supremacist language" not only makes false implications, but is expressly false - at no point do you support the language, merely the choice to link to it.  This isn't even a matter of misinterpretation or misunderstanding as it was in the Gilbert incident.  This is a deliberate misrepresentation of your position.

I sincerely hope that this letter will be recognized as defamation by its recipients.  However, given the large number of alleged recipients and the alarmist tone of the letter, I have to admit I'm slightly concerned.  In the event that you should suffer any harm as a result of this letter, I think you most likely have a legal case against "the Ghost of Adolph Rupp."  Even though the letter was sent pseudonymously, he has an IP address.  Your willingness not to "tattle" is admirable, but there are legal protections against defamation designed to protect you and others from these exact situations.

Was the letter actually sent pseudonymously?  If so, are people really going to read it?  I would think that this kind of accusation at least requires a real name. 

So I wonder whether you've deleted the guy's real name off the letter, Scott.  You write "If you do, I'll take the high ground and not reveal your identity. I'm no tattler."  Well, in cases of extreme stupidity / calculated provocation such as this letter represents, I have an interest in finding out whether it is amateur (stupidity) or professional (provocation).  Should I file a FOIA request for a copy of this public communication?  Or can you tell us in general what kind of person turns up when you Google the name.

Rich, he sent the letter under his own name.  I've chosen not to reprint it because, well, because of the principle of the thing.  I own my words, he doesn't, and that matters.

They that have power to hurt and will do none,  

That do not do the thing, they most do show,  

Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,  

Unmovèd, cold, and to temptation slow,  

They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,  

And husband nature's riches from expense;  

They are the lords and owners of their faces,  

Others, but stewards of their excellence.  

The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,  

Though to itself, it only live and die,  

But if that flower with base infection meet,  

The basest weed outbraves his dignity.  

    For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;  

    Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.

Given the mention of Imus, [this might be interesting too.](http://www.sportsjournalists.com/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=941044bbfea27bb40c8c6ebd5669b7a0&topic=39936.msg1111598#msg1111598)

Scott, this is ridiculous, and I just wanted to voice my support for you.  I was involved in a similar situation back in '98, when a professor at my undergraduate institution, denied tenure, started sending me harassing emails.  When I responded angrily (and vulgarly), he threatened to send my email to the chair of my graduate department.  To cover my ass, I sent a preemptive email to my chair that, while defending myself, made me look like an idiot for being involved in such a pissing contest.  So personally, I'd ignore all this unless someone at UCI makes it an issue.  

And I do think you have the foundation of a defamation suit here.  Claiming that you enable white supremacy is like claiming that the ACLU enables the Klan.

Are these people from PatriotBoy blog the embodiment of the BORG?

Be assimilated or you will be fired.

Be assimilated or you will be reported to your superiors.

This is unacceptable behavior. This is extortionist blackmail. Agree with the BORG or be fucked with.

Scott, I for the most part, disagreed with your point of view on that whole kerfuffle, but this is just ridiculous.  That guy needs to take a sedative or 20.

I hope this doesn't have any negative career repercussions for you

SEK: I disagreed with your argument at the General's blog. However I certainly do not support what Adolphus is threatening to do to you. I hope this issue resolves itself in a mature manner, but do know that his doing this may constitute harrassment. 

In short: Sue
