## The Pros and Cons Scholarly Appellations

**Pro:**
Everyone likes "Mike."

**Con:** 
No one wants to quote "Mike" in a scholarly monograph.

**Pro:**
"Jimmy" evokes kind faces (Stewart) and eager earnestness (Olsen).

**Con:**
No one wants to quote "Jimmy" in a scholarly monograph.

**Pro:**
We all surreptitiously hum along to "Mandy" when we hear it.

**Con:**
No one wants to quote "Mandy" in a scholarly monography.

Exceptions obviously abound—Chuck and Jenny spring to mind—but for the most part, endearing childhood nicknames look odd in scholarship.  Perhaps this perceived awkwardness is nothing more than a manifestation of my anxiety about not being taken seriously, so I'm reluctant to quote people whose names seem unserious.  Not sure.

However, I say with certainty that should you ever read a scholarly work by "Scottie Eric Kaufman," I didn't write it.  (I heartily endorse the opposite tendency, such as the affixing of "-ford" to the end of otherwise ordinary names, so that they seem more serious.  "Scottford Eric Kaufman" has a nice, stentorian ring to it.)

An important qualification -- "ford" only works with monosyllabic appelations.  Adamford clearly doesn't work.

I'm not as sure on this one, but I also think that the one syllable has to end with a consonant.  Example: Stuford.

For multisyllabic appelations, use "-fjord."

Try going to one word: "Scoffman."

Or, better yet, "Scoffman Fjord [(and his Unitar)"](http://itsgreatshakes.blogspot.com/2005/07/willie-joe-and-his-unitar-unitar.html)

Since classiness seems little more than sounding like a European town, I suggest that Adam henceforth be taken very, very seriously when referred to as "Adamshire."  (Or, alternately, "Adam-on-Kotskoshire.")

I guess by using an abridgment of my first name, I join the elite fraternity inhabited by Fred Pfeil, Jenny Davidson, and Judy Kutulas.  Possibly Carrie Shanafelt too, although that might be the name she was born with; Bill V. Mullen was christened "Bill" and not William.
