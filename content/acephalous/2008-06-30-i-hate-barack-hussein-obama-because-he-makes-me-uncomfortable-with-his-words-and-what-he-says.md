## I hate Barack Hussein Obama because he makes me uncomfortable with his words and what he says

(_Hearing Obama's remark about respecting those who "__make us uncomfortable with their words" got me thinking:_ _what would happen if [my irate former student](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/and\_yet\_i\_still.html) got his hands on [Roget's regnant tome](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/all\_scribes\_uti.html) and started [bloviating about Obama on the Internet](http://www.marchosis.com/showthread.php?p=4028)?_)

First in the foremost if you are stimulated by new ideas because you are the kind of person like me and you can think for yourself rather than simply accept what Obama says as ultimate truth I think you will find this post importantly of interest to you.  

I guess I should start by saying that what Obama thinks is not what he says and even what he says he thinks only provides cover for an incoherent agenda of sorts.  Even if we overlook the logistical impossibilities of such ideas as the ones Obama has profligated the underlying premise of all of them is flawed and you can tell this is the ontological truth of the matter because of the insults he employs like raucous scoundrel and pugnacious.

But if you look soberly and carefully at the evidence all around you on the television you will obviously see Obama's grandisonant effusions are not pedantic treatises expressing theories or extravaganzas dealing in fables or fancies they are substantial sober outpouring from the very soul of demagogism.  

Now stay with me for a moment here because I am making a point.  Specifically that there may be nothing we can do to prevent Obama from making good on his word to destabilize and undermine the already volatile social fabric he purportedly aims to save.

When we compare this disturbing conclusions I have drawn from the premises presented we can only conclude that the comforting picture purveyed by his conspirators and feel what is called by experts cognitive dissonance from it.  Our only recourse is to kick ass and take down names.

If his attempts to perpetuate what we all know is a corrupt system have spurred us to challenge his uncouth libidinous assumptions about merit then Obama may have accomplished a useful thing because if we are to set our sights on eternity then we must be guided by a healthy and progressive ideology not by the salacious ornithological ideologies Obama promotes.

It is possible that Obama does not realize this because he has been imbibed by so much of the propaganda of quislingism and if that is the case as I believe it to be then I tremulantly recommend we halt the malmish adulation heaped upon wretched misfits.  If anything Obama has hair in his brain and even though we all are to some extent as hairy Obama sets the bar on the curve that much higher up the mountain.

Does Obama have trouble living with himself knowing that he gets perfervid about unilateralism because whenever that question is asked Obama and his conspirators run and hide.  I suspect that that is precisely what they are going to do now so as to avoid hearing me say that Obama's bloodthirsty _ipse dixits_ leave the current power structure untouched while simultaneously killing countless children through the starvation of disease. 

ARE THE CHILDREN HIS ENEMIES?  

As you know doubt realize by now that is a particularly timely question because in fact I just half an hour ago heard someone express the opinion that Obama may be reasonably cunning with words and what he says even though he is nerdy with everything else.

Obama believes that ageism resonates with the body's natural alpha waves but unfortunately as long as he believes such absurdities he will continue to commit atrocities.  

Let us not sink to his level and let us combat plagiarism by exercising our right to speak out and denounce his publicitiy stunts as totally unrepresentative of the valuves of this society and let me conclude by stating that Obama's brain must work very differently from mine because it is black.

You can quote me on that.

Are you going to be writing about Obama all through the election?  Cause I think that hearing about him is depressing.  He's already denounced Clark and MoveOn, for nothing.  Sure, whatever it takes to get the job done, but come on.  When Clinton sister souljah'd Sister Souljah, he wasn't attacking one of his foremost political supporters.  I still am moderately glad that Obama won the primary over Hillary -- only because that way, we might stop alternating the Presidency between a Bush and a Clinton -- but really he's managing to come out below my already low expectations.

_Are you going to be writing about Obama all through the election?_ 

What would you rather me write about?  Banks' Culture novels, which I'm reading as per your recommendation?  (Though not from the start, because I can't find a copy, but I think _The Player of Games_ is the second one in the series.)

Yeah, sure.  I'd be interested to hear about _The Player of Games_ from someone who may have actually read a few other bildungsroman.

I denounce MoveOn for their mountains and mountains of spam. You have one crazy night in college, you drunkenly sign one on-line petition, and now you're getting more emails from Eli Pariser than you are ones reminding you that "Your gun is set to get bigger and bigger."

Ditto Todd on the mountains of MoveOn spam.  And if we don't support Obama (especially when he's being non-ideological), we'll be stuck with the conservative-in-maverick-sheep's-clothing-guy. - NM

Muammar Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi (Formally known as the Lybian head of state) thinks that Obama is a Muslim, somewhere in an article on the MEMRI site. Now if I could only find the link... 

But what would he know?

Ah, here it is.

"There are elections in America now. Along came a black citizen of Kenyan African origins, a Muslim, who had studied in an Islamic school in Indonesia. His name is Obama."

But hey, he could be blowing smoke....

He's blowing smoke.  I'm not sure why -- I mean, he might even _believe_ it, but so does [this guy](http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/kovach/080626), and I don't think they have much in common outside of "crazy."

It's sad to me that the story has to be "Guys? Obama clearly isn't a Muslim, where did you get that crazy shit?" instead of "Guys? Who the \*\*\*\* cares what religion Obama is?"

"salacious ornithological ideologies"?

Is the writer aware that ornithology is the scientific study of birds? I had no idea that the study of avians could be considered remotely salacious -- that's a new one. Oh, well. I guess one of the great things about the USA is that we are all entitle to spout our opinions and ideas, no matter how uniformed or ignorant we might be. But you might want to check definitions before you use those multisyllabic words.

I think the recent rash of [hilariously bad](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/06/16/well-that-settles-it-obamas-gonna-lose/#comment-25379) blog comments may actually be in the top 10 things about Obama winning the election. You can't write material this good. My favorite part is "multisyllabic," what's yours?
