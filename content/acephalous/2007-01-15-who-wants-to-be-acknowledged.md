You wrote over 100 pages because that's just the way dissertating works: you write a lot more than goes into the final project. 

I'm guessing that, by "soon," you mean well within the next couple of weeks? I'd love to have a look at what you're working on, but I don't think I could give you comments before the end of the month . . . .
