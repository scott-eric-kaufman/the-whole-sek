_SEK went to the supermarket to pick up tuna fish for his elderly cat who now only eats food that also contains tuna. As tuna is on sale, he purchases twenty cans of it and is on the checkout line in front of POLITE DRUNK MAN._

**POLITE DRUNK MAN:** You don’t eat all them cans, now?

**SEK:** Wasn’t planning on it.

**POLITE DRUNK MAN:** TV say they full of Menicillin.

**SEK:** Mercury?

**POLITE DRUNK MAN:** Menicillin, bad for the children, real bad.

**SEK:** I promise not to share it with any kids.

**POLITE DRUNK MAN:** Menicillin’s terrible, make ‘em have miscarriages.

**SEK:** The kids?

**POLITE DRUNK MAN:** Ain’t even get a chance to be kids, they born miscarried, or with arms.

**SEK:** I’ll keep that in mind.

**POLITE DRUNK MAN:** Dead babies with arms, that’s what Menicillin do. Best watch out.

**SEK:** I will, promise.
