## Liberal Fascism?  Try <em>Conservative</em> Fascism (Very Seriously Thoughtful, Dripping with Unprecedented Care and Detail)

In the wake of the success of fellow Jew Jonah Goldberg, I've decided to quote-mine my way into a publishing deal with a reputable firm.  My thesis: Bush is not only _a_ fascist, he is the direct ideological heir to _the_ fascist, Benito Mussolini.  We begin (where else?) in Iraq: 
"Italian Oil Group Fight Iraqui Grant," _New York Times_, 30 September 1930

The stakes are the rich and as yet unexploited oil fields of Iraq, and the contestants are the present holders of an exclusive concession ... and an entirely new international oil group in which the guiding genius is understood to be Benito Mussolini.

The troops?  As of 9/11, they'll be there indefinitely:

"Long Occupation Indicated," _New York Times_, 12 September 1923

ROME, Sept. 11 -- All present indications are that it will be a long time before the Italian troups evacuate.

It is obvious that bringing the ... murders to justice must be a long and difficult if not impossible task.  Two weeks have elapsed since the crime was committed ... It is considered doubtful whether the ... If the real murderers are not found it is improbable that the Italian troops will ever evacuate.

Like Bush, Mussolini believed the free market can do anything the government do, only better and more efficiently:

"Mussolini Greets Business Congress, Tells the Delegates Paternalism Must Go and Capitalism Will Stay," _New York Times_, 19 March 1923

"It is my conviction," said Signor Mussolini in his address, "that the State must renounce its economic functions, especially those of a monopolistic character, for which it cannot provide.  The Government must give free play to private enterprise, and must forego any measures of State control and State paternalism.  Such measures may satisfy the demagogy and ambitions of Socialists, but as shown by experience, will in the long run turn out to be absolutely fatal to the interests and economic development of any country."

"I do not believe the complex of forces which is known by the name of capitalism is about to end, as has for so long been announced by several extreme Socialist thinkers.  Events have shown that all systems which interfere with initiative and individual impulse fail more or less in a short lapse of time.

Like any neoconservative, inchoate or not, Mussolini wanted to privatize everything in sight:

"Mussolini Starts Drastic Reforms," _New York Times_, 3 November 1922

[T]he State will sell or lease to private enterprises all the State monopolies ... These include the parcel post, the telegraph, and the railways.

He and Bush share a hatred of the Ivory Tower and a desire to defund the elitists who live in it:

[T]he State will abolish ... all universities[.]

And the poor are, of course, lazy.  Something must be done about them:

In any case [the State] will oblige the unemployed to go to the places where they can be usefully employed[.]

Perhaps the army can usefully employ them?  If not, there's always the _other_ army, a.k.a. "Mussolini's Blackwater":

"Fascisti to Create Formidable Army," _New York Times_, 11 September 1930

"The reform," said General Teruzzi, "while it harks back to the origins and voluntary tradition of the corps, will inspire morale of the highest order, an augmenting of military efficiency, of perfect cohesion and of strict collaboration between the militia and the army."

Gen. Teruzzi chose to announce these reforms on 9/11 for an important reason.  Like Bush, Teruzzi and Mussolini know what the final page will say when history was written.  If anyone dares suggest otherwise, the _fascisti_ knew how to deal with the liberal media:

"Fascisti Leader Wins Duel With Communist Editor," _NY Times_, 27 October 1921

Etore Ciccotti, communist editor of Il Paese, was seriously wounded today in a duel with Professor Benito Mussolini, leader of the Fascisti.  Swords were used.  [...]  

It ended in the fourteenth bout, when the physicians pronounced Ciccotti to be in a serious condition and unable to continue the encounter.  [...]  A dispatch to The London Times from Milan says that it is believe that the duel between Signor Ciccotti and Signor Mussolini will be resumed tomorrow with pistols.

"Mussolini Victor in a Duel," _NY Times_, 15 May 1922.

Professor Benito Mussolini, leader of the Fascisti, who bears more than 100 wounds received in battle, engaged in a duel yesterday with Signor Missiroli, editor of the Turin Secolo, over differences arising from articles appearing in their respective newspapers.

Ciccotti and Missiroli got off easy:

"Anti-Fascisti Lose Teeth," _New York Times_, 16 February 1923

A new and grotesque method of asserting their authority [has] been adopted by the Fascisti at Fiume.

Entering apartments, they forced residents to utter the national cry, "Hail, Hail Italy!"  Those who refused to obey has some of their sound teeth pulled out.

That's either O.G. waterboarding or special rendition for teeth.  Whatever.  Doesn't matter.  What was Mussolini to do, _not_ act on actionable intelligence?

"Mussolini Busy Rounding up Reds," _New York Times_, 7 February 1923

The rumored discovery of a secret order from the Moscow International executive to Italian Reds to the effect that the Mussolini government must be overthrown and the Fascisti party disbanded by every means, has caused the government to adopt most drastic measures.  Wholesale arrests of Reds are proceeding in the most important cities [and] a prominent leader of the Reds was found in possession of sterling and checks amounting to several thousand lire.

The Ticking Nuke, people.  _The Ticking Nuke_.  What choice did he have?  Like Bush, he had none but one:

Invade Iraq.  What did Mussolini do?  He invaded Ethiopia.  Big mistake.  In this sense, Bush is a _better_ conservative fascist ... but I'll save that discussion for the book.

As you can tell from my very serious, thoughtful post, my argument about Conservative Fascism ("From Mussolini to The Invisible Hands of Compassionate Conservatism and Fetuses") is one which has never been made in such detail or with such care as I will make it.  I plan to erect a website [devoted to singing its praises](http://liberalfascism.nationalreview.com/post/?q=M2M2ZWUyZGIzNDFhZjE2NzVlM2VjMDQxMjRkYzdmYzA=&p=1) and a blog in which I'll do nothing but shamelessly [reprint](http://liberalfascism.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTcyODA3NjA5NTcxMWYwNzc2ZDEyMzQ3NzU4MTkxZTU=) [embarrassingly](http://liberalfascism.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZmEyM2RkODQ5YWFhNzg5ODJjMjJjMzUwNGQyZDJiOTY=) [sycophantic](http://liberalfascism.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTFiYjkyMzU5ZjM3YWFjODI4NmZlNTQ4ODdhMTQ4Y2E=) [letters](http://liberalfascism.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZjA4N2U2ZmQ1NjJhYzhjZWIwNjc4MGExMzgzYzM2NmM=).  

Because you _know_ you've Hit It Big Time when your words resonate with those ideologically disposed to agree with them.

Dammit, if I could leave my dissertation as a long series of tentatively-linked block quotes, I'd be done by now.

Doesn't make for much of a dissertation, but it can score you a book contract! 

(Full disclosure: I meant to save this as a draft, so it's more "notes" than "post," since I intended on including more connective tissue.  Really, the whole thing's just a justification for the crack about special rendition for teeth.  Sigh.)

A friend of mine tried to write her dissertation this way.  She was eventually told "No!" rather sternly by her committee and forced to rewrite it the old fashioned way, with paragraphs and arguments.  Still, in the course of doing so she managed to score a rather plum job.

Really, though, why are you collecting random NYT articles from the 1920s about Italian fascism?  Are these meant to be raw materials for funyuns?  Because that seems like a mistake.

Very Good, sir. The parallels between Bush and Mussolini are quite obvious. However to modern 'conservatives' we "liberals" are not worth the amount of violence as we just roll over and play dead in front of the Fascisti.
