Vote Team Acephalous for "[Most Humorous Post](http://wampum.wabanaki.net/vault/2006/03/002518.html#comments)."  

_"Didn't I already do that?"_

Yes, you did.  But that was for the _semi-_finals.  Now that I'm a finalist, you'll need to do it again.

_"Why would I do that?"_

First, because  you're my friend.  My _best_ friend.  

Second, because the more attention this little blog gets the better the chance that [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/quick\_hits.html) will happen again.  'Cause I'm clearly only in this for the money.  
_  
"Well, why haven't you responded to my detailed and worthy of a substantial response and/or been reading/commenting on my blog lately you favor-asking fiend?"_

I _already_ explained why.  I'm _beyond_ busy at the moment.  Or have you not noticed that all my posts seem to be about Silar Weir Mitchell lately?  I will become a human being again shortly.

If I vote for you, will you install better vending machines in the hallways?Will you promise more assemblies and pep rallies?And what is your position on the suggested Prom theme of "A Flight of Fancy"?

And did you vote for me when I was nominated in THREE categories for a Koufax and thus perhaps save me from my current, ignonimous situation of having not made the finals in any of them?  Hmm?  Well, didja didja do?

No, I didn't think so.  Best friend my arse.

Hey!  That was NOT an invitation to roger me roundly so keep your hands to yourself.

But I will add you to my blogroll since you have me on yours.  Quid pro quo, or something along those lines.  Kind of what they do in Congress, only without the indictments.
