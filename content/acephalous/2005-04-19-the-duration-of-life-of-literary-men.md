## The Duration of Life of Literary Men

According to William Guy in the September, 1859 edition of _The Quarterly Journal of the Statistical Society_, determining the duration of the life of literary men is more difficult than composing "A Summary View of the Duration of Life in the upper and middle ranks of society."  Why?  Because literary men, 
both in prose and verse, are of every rank and profession .... In treating, therefore, of the duration of life of literary men, I must be understood to be speaking of a mixed class, consisting on the one hand, of those who have no one distinct and defined professional calling, but who make literature one of their pursuits, and the duration of whose life is consequently affected by the habits of composition in very various degress; and, on the other hand, of those with whom literature is a distinct profession.

Guy collected from the 1815 to 1852 editions of _Chalmers' Biographical Dictionary_ a compendium of the ages at which 942 "men more or less devoted to literary pursuits, and of more or less celebrity in different walks of literature" perished.  He compiled [these](https://www.typepad.com/t/app/control/files?\_\_mode=show\_link&file=dead%!p(MISSING)oets%!t(MISSING)able.gif) [three](https://www.typepad.com/t/app/control/files?\_\_mode=show\_link&file=dead%!p(MISSING)oets%!t(MISSING)able%!g(MISSING)if) [tables](https://www.typepad.com/t/app/control/files?\_\_mode=show\_link&file=dead%!p(MISSING)oets%!t(MISSING)able%!g(MISSING)if).  His conclusions?  

*   "It is quite possible that the poetical temperament, as it is commonly called, may be a phase of constitutional weakness, and a cause of early death."
*   "That schoolmasters who devote themselves to literary pursuits should rank next above poets, but decidedly below the other classes in the Table, will not excite surprise when it is borne in mind that in addition to such influence as literary habits themselves may exercise in undermining health and shortening life, the schoolmaster is exposed to the serious drawback of confinement with his pupils during many hours of the day in an atmosphere rarely of the purest.

I am comforted by the fact that the average age of schoolmasters who survive to 26 is 63.91.  That beats the English aristocracy by 12.3 years, although all those revolts, wars, beheadings, etc. no doubt weighed down their mean.  But none of this answers the question of why this schoolmaster's 102-103 degree fever refuses to break.  The answer?  This schoolmaster has pneumonia and has been barred by his doctor from teaching until his fever swells no more.  Were I thinking as profoundly as I'm sweating, thoughts about the deleterious scholarly miasma in which I currently wade would follow, but it appears I have some serious sweating to do...

If that's the case, your social life won't be all that social for a while then.  Sure, it'll be a living, but it won't be a life.  I just posted this elsewhere, but it could stand to be read by this audience too:

Now that I've been diagnosed with pneumonia and am prohibited from leaving the house or human interaction until the fever breaks, I have a question:

What do people do with oodles of free time? I've been doing nothing for a couple of hours now and I can feel the boredom creep slowly from all sides. Normally I steal five minutes for the RLPA here, twenty minutes for my blog there, but now I'm pretty much limited to "things I can do from the couch," which means watch television, eat soup, and type and read when I can see straight.

What else is there to do? Or is this the onset of cabin fever? Wait...the Mets are on soon! Huzzah! Three hours covered, the rest of another sleepless night to go.

Is the little womedievalist locked out of the apartment too?  What about Finnegan, Rachael, Virgil, and the Mund?  Or is this strictly a people pneumonia?

The little womedievalist is under doctor's orders not to touch anything I've touched, drink after me, etc., and I'm under orders to stay away from her, because my pneumonia and her asthma would be a deadly cocktail.  So I'll be sleeping on the couch, which is where I want to sleep right now; one minute I feel buried under a ton of snow, barely able to breathe or stop shivering, the next I'm in Tahiti.

In July.

In a parka.

I'm not what you'd call "a happy camper" right now.  I finally, FINALLY get back on my feet.  I'm teaching again, writing again, researching again...I'm everythinging again and then I catch pneumonia?  In Southern California?  In April?

It's because God hates you. Now have some more soup and get used to daytime TV. O-prah, O-prah, O-prah...
