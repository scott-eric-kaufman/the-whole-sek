Someone ought to remind mainstream conservatives that the Jason "Molotov" Mitchell responsible for "[O.T.P. (One Term President)](http://biggovernment.com/bparks/2010/03/03/comedy-rap-video-slams-obama-as-o-t-p-one-term-president/)" is the same guy who produced and starred in this video last month:

[Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/EmWdExg4kic)

You know, _for the record_.  

Also for the record: WOLVERINE! have better flow than [the Young Cons](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/06/the-young-cons-believe-the-bible-is-relatively-silent-on-issues-relating-to-supplyside-economics.html), but as Ackerman [notes](http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2010/03/03/you-only-get-half-a-bar/), they also clearly write from the fringe, as their song repeatedly addresses the first black president as “boy”; has a lyric in which a rapper imagining herself as a soldier in Iraq declares herself “sick of smelling like a mosque after Ramadan”; and then features a birther talking about how Obama isn’t an American. But I'm sure the fact that mainstream conservatives are attracted to the increasingly bizarre elements of their movement has nothing to do with [the rhetoric they use](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2010/02/rhetoric-amounts-to-more-than-what-you.html).

I've been avoiding clicking on that video at four or five other places now. I _did_ experience the full thrill of the OTP joint (that's the word, right? Probably not. Whatever. Word.), though: I thought the way they start out in the voice of a disappointed Obama voter is, if you'll pardon the expression, rhetorically interesting, since I'm quite certain that there's almost no overlap between Obama voters, independent or otherwise, and the Riefenstaal-manques producing agitprop art for the Tea Party wing.

Delightful bonus detail: at the end of that video (about 3:04), Martin Luther King Jr. gets dragged in (now that he's dead, King often supports conservative causes). Except Mitchell seems to be quoting from a typo or misreading: it's actually "the moral ARC of the universe" that "bends toward justice," not "the moral ARM." Because only one of those really makes any sense.

Latinist, you think that is the delightful bonus detail? My favorite bit is him showing a picture of Jesus, with "Abolishing the Old Testament" at the bottom of the screen, while saying "unless I missed something." He managed to point out exactly what he was missing, without actually noticing himself. That's rather brilliant. I mean, that's like lighting a fire, while standing in it, and saying "unless there's a fire somewhere, I'm not moving."

P.T. Smith, when I saw that I thought that there was no way anyone could be that dense, and that this has to be some sort of false flag operation working to denigrate these views to Christians.  &lt;/wishfulthinking&gt;

OK, OK, I watched it. Here's what I don't get: "stay on the right side of history" implies that the trend of history is, as King put it, moving in the right direction. But his argument rests on the idea that the Western tradition (because that's the only history that matters) has _always_ punished homosexuality, and _change is bad_.

Scott,

I just want to say that your ability to seek out and watch or read all varieties of conservative crap is admirable, as I could not get through more than 50 seconds of that video before turning it off and ramming my head into a wall.  You are performing some kind of public service, watching all this so that we don't have to.

Pay no attention to the ancient Greeks behind the curtain.

It's the idea of a homosexuality as a historic threat to christian civilization, I'd wager. The ancient Greeks were kinda equivocal about this stuff too, and more to the point, they weren't christians, so what could they know?

Actually, the Athenians behind the curtain were women: the gynaeceum was separated from men's living space, and respectable women rarely appeared in public without being veiled. Hellas being what it was, other city cultures varied.

I found it infuriating that this guy was slandering a century-dead African leader and claiming that there was some law requiring everyone to let him swive them.  Lying about African people? A proud tradition in America.

Actually ... that one's not entirely false.  OK, the way that he presents it is almost entirely inaccurate, but the slander part is generally recognized by historians.

Mwanga II came to power as Kabaka (king) of Buganda in 1884, at a time when Muslims, Catholics and Protestants were all vying for converts and political influence or control within the kingdom.  His father, Mutesa, had executed a number of Muslim converts over accusations of disloyalty.  Mwanga saw the primary threat to his authority coming from Christian converts, but while he executed or in other ways punished some Christians, he promoted others to high office.

The twenty-two executed young men were pages within the royal court.  While Mitchell is just making shit up in his "passed legislation" line, there was the general understanding that advances of the King could not be reasonably refused.  Over the course of his reign Mwanga took sixteen wives, but he was also known for taking young men as sexual partners.  This was seen as a vice both in Ganda culture and among the converts, but his power as Kabaka gave him license to behave in ways that would violate standard social norms.  The refusal of the Catholic pages to submit to his advances, as well as their proximity to him as members of the court, were among the factor that spurred his execution of them in a rage over what he perceived to be Christian disloyalty.  Ugandans today primarily remember the Uganda Martyrs for their execution as Christians/Catholics, rather than anything to do with sexual politics.

Ron Kassimir has a good recent survey of this history and the classic account is by John Rowe:

Ronald Kassimir, "Complex Martyrs: Symbols of Catholic Church Formation and Political Differentiation in Uganda." African Affairs, Vol. 90, No. 360 (1991), pp. 357-382.

J. A. Rowe, "The Purge of Christians at Mwanga's Court: A Reassessment of This Episode in Buganda History." The Journal of African History, Vol. 5, No. 1 (1964), pp. 55-72.

So, in simpler terms: a king wanted something from a subject, didn't get what he wanted, got pissed, killed said subject.

Yeah, that sounds about right for the history of kings.

Thanks for that, JPool. 

Real history is not kind to ideologues.

P. T. Smith,  

Yeah, though of course it's a moral economy/politics of legitimacy kind of thing — Holly Hanson has argued that the big change in the late-nineteenth century was from a basically patrimonial relationship between rulers and subject in Buganda to one conditioned primarily by violence, which in turn encouraged factional conflicts.  

So in simpler terms, [historians aren't very good at simpler terms](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2010/03/04/lessons-of-history-2/).

Ahist, no problem.

I fail to see the difference between rounding up gay people and killing them, and having a bill that condemns gay people to death.  Either way, death is the deterrent for the "behavior."

And, upon looking further, I find no reference to Mwanga's evil homosexual regime anywhere except on blogs citing such things without any evidence...but, far be it for me to assume that the guy in the video would take two seconds to understand Ugandan history and not tread lightly on the absurdity of religious colonialism that had ravaged that country prior to and following Mwanga's rule.

Score fifty for logical fallacies on this video...

Well, I have a couple of things to chime in about on what that lovely video had to say.  JPool was right about Mwanga, but what needs to also be pointed out was that Mwanga wasn't executed by anyone, but rather exiled and eventually became a convert himself--he died in 1903 (quite a few years off of 1886).  The June 3rd date refers to a catholic saint that was burned alive for his beliefs.  (You know, I really hate it when facts get in the way of brainwashing people.)
