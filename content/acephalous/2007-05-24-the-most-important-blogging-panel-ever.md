## The Most Important Blogging Panel Ever*

I wanted to wait until the promised podcast of yesterday's event was up, but since Brad's already posted [his notes](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/05/marginal\_notes\_\_1.html), I thought I'd enter into the fray.\*\*  Some random points, as I am very tired, very busy, and very tired:

*   As I was waiting to fly to Sacramento on Southwest, Delta paged "San Jose customer Scott Kaufman to Gate 8."  After the third time—and despite being painfully confused—I walked to the Delta counter.  The attendant told me that I'd been bumped to a later flight.  I told them I was flying Southwest, but they didn't appear to be listening.  They wanted me to sign something.  I tried to explain the confusion.  Finally, I walked away.  (Tomorrow, this will be the topic of a "You Finish the Post" Contest, in which I narrate the first half of the conversation, and you provide the humorous _esprit de l'escalier_.
*    I learned that I'll be sharing a panel with [this guy](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/) and [this guy](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/) come November.  You should attend!  I'll be [the zebra](http://www.dorriolds.com/pages/illustration/referee.jpg) sitting between them.
*   Brad and I learned not to fear [The Ogged](http://www.unfogged.com/), for The Ogged is a gentle soul who, when he cuts, does so politely.  (And, despite being Iranian, only with words.)
*   Speaking (again) of Brad, I might have been an economist if I'd had him as a professor.  His quiet hilarity is a quality I gravitated toward as an undergraduate. *   Speaking of which—and this and the previous bullet will be verified when the podcast's published—Eric Rauchway is also much more soft-spoken and funny than I imagined.  (His colleague, Ari Kelman, is equally funny, but not quite so quiet.)  (Apologies for the double parenthetical, but I feel the need to add: I'm not trying to reconstruct what they said that was funny because you'll be able to witness it for yourself soon enough.)

\*Which I'll describe in more detail on a day which doesn't involve hours in airports and/or above California.

\*\*In today's bit of web-meta, when the podcast hits the 'Net, pay close attention to the Brad first scribbling, then typing as Tedra and I speak.  Not only is he composing a post about a blogging panel during the panel itself, he's reenacting the very history of letters he discusses in his talk.

You're already on another blogging panel?  This is begging for a _Spinal Tap_ mockumentary treatment.  You know: Scott figures that he can get more points in if he divides his talk into 11 "minutes" rather than 10 minutes; Scott shows off "The Blank Overhead", a projection accidentally erased that now serves as a meditation on where all our ideas come from; Scott in his latter days must speak at a blogging panel in the local Elks Lodge along with Kaye Grogan and as headliner the Fafblog guy, who doesn't show (with an advertisement showing "Tonight: THE MEDIUM LOBSTER, Kaye Grogan, also Scot Kaufmann"), finally, it is announced that Scott is big in Japan and gets to go on a final triumphant tour along with a translator and a quick study guide for Sailor Moon.

_reenacting the very history of letters_

Is the post going to be titled "Oxen of the Sun"?

Adam has consented to join a panel about (presumably) academic blogging?  The mind boggles.

But Ben, that was always implicit, wasn't it?  A post about the uselessness of academic blogging is still a post about academic blogging.  Without a certified pessimist as well as an optimist, this couldn't be a proper subject for cultural dispute.

Scott, when you make it big in Japan, be sure to have [these](http://altjapan.typepad.com/my\_weblog/2007/05/better\_stronger.html) [guys](http://patrickmacias.blogs.com/er/2007/05/funky\_mental\_da.html) show you around.

Early on, I made a commitment to myself that I wouldn't do anything CV-able that related to blogging.  Then I saw that there was a loophole: I could do CV-able things that were _anti-_blogging!

I'm a little unclear as to how I could suddenly discover this overlooked loophole to a rule that I myself made up, but that's how it played out.

Rich, as I said at the talk on Wednesday, I find it alternately elating and depressing that I can't land a panel related to, say, _my dissertation_, but that people can't seem to get enough of me talking about blogging about writing it.

Clever, Adam, clever.  

Mike, as soon as Eric Rauchway tells me where it is, I'll 1) watch it in horror and 2) post a link.

Constructivist, when I make it Big In Japan, I'll be disappointed by anything less adventurous than _Lost in Translation_.  I demand _adventure_ when I travel.  (As Adam will find out when I pelt him with paint balls from a makeshift blind.)

You won't be disappointed, then.  Seriously, _Lost in Translation_ is super low-key by Macias and Co.'s standards.  I wouldn't know from personal experience with them, not being in Tokyo and all, but I do like their blogs.
