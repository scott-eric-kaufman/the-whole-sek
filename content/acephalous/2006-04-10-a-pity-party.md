(_Two men enter a room.  In the center is a couch with a rumpled blanket on it._ _A toppled stack of CDs lies in front of it.__Visible covers read "Disintegr...," "...iders from Mars," "Joy Divi...," and "...e Bunnymen."  Next to the couch is a table on which the remains of three cartons of ice cream sit.  A wooden dining room chair faces the corner.  On the television set is a frozen image of [a demented bunny](http://acephalous.typepad.com/Frank\_DVD\_Cap017.jpg).  The men inspect the room._)
**Man #1:** Hmm . . .

**Man#2:** Huh?

(_Man #1 focuses the attention of Man #2 on the couch.  Man #2 picks up the "blanket."_)
**Man #2:** This is no blanket.  (_hands Man #1 a black crewneck_)  This isn't either!  (_hands Man #1 a pair of black slacks_)  Or this!  (_hands Man #1 a black sweater_)  Or this!  (_hands Man #1 a pair of black suspenders_)  Or this!  (_hand Man #1 two black socks_)

**Man #1:** Now I'm no expert in the paranormal . . . _but_ I believe what we have here is a case of spontaneous solopsistic implosion.

**Man #2:** An SSI?  Really?

**Man #1:** _Just_ _look at this place._

**Man #2:** (_just looks at this place_)  Point taken.

Like you, I believe in the form and the community. And yet, I'm dreadfully afraid that I'll do something just like this just as inadvertently. 

You've got my whole-hearted sympathies!

You have mine as well.  You serve the form well, and your community is always behind you.  You have blogospheric friends. You may not see us, but we are here, ready to send you friendly comments, pings, and trackbacks when you need us. Whatever the TTLB may say, you're the tops in the ecosystem you have built in the past year.

Thanks y'all.  Hope you don't mind my changing the post on you.  Too much unadulterated self-pity makes a body feel, well, silly and self-pitying.  (For those who didn't read the original post, what I said, as reflected here in the comments, is that I said something I shouldn't have, got in trouble for it, but still believe in both the form and the community thusly represented here.)
