While proofing one of the articles I'm finishing today, I checked up on "underscore"  in the _OED_.  What I found disturbs me:
**1952 S. KAUFFMANN** _Philanderer_ (1954) iv. 58 He could feel the stupidity of what he was writing being underscored by the stupidity of what was being written in the rooms next door.

There are so many things in there to dispirit me, I barely know where to begin.

That has nothing to do with you, Scott -- that guy has two "f"s _and_ two "n"s.  Whereas iirc, you have three or four ns.

I hope it's OK that I post my comment of support here.  Be well, my friend.

But what an awesome sentence! It doesn't make me want to read the book -- particularly after googling it and finding some much less snappy sentences -- but even so, don't we all have days like that?
