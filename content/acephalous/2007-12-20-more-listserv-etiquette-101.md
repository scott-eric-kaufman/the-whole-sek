## More Listserv Etiquette 101

I thought I'd [made this plain](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/09/what-they-see-w.html).  

Miriam [had my back](http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the\_little\_professor/2007/10/how-to-ask-ques.html).  

The material'd been covered.  

We'd moved to the next chapter. 

Yet I had to read this tonight:
Does anyone know if Marx wrote anything substantial on capital-_qua_-capital?  (I'm not so concerned with his writing on money, although if something about it seems relevant to capital, I'd be happy to hear about that too.)  If so, in what text might I find this?  Thanks so much for extending your not inconsiderable expertise to suborn my project.  I'll consider slapping your name in my acknowledgments page for fifteen seconds before deciding I'm a self-made man who never needed your help anyway.

Thanks!

All y'all who ask the obvious of experts, let me whisper some sweet somethings in your ear:  
Were I an evil telepathic narcissist, you'd think yourself the dynamite of my PROJECTED FUSE.

Were I an angry giant robot, I'd evaporate your people with my devastating RAY STAR. 

Were I some folk who had tell of Internets, all my YAHOOS would ASK JEEVES who OGLED the cripplingly obvious answer to your question and we would laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh at your inability to locate the most basic of source material and the gall required to broadcast your shortcomings to everyone who knows you because it would be funny.

Well, you know, it all depends on what you mean by _substantial._

As with your first-linked post, excellent mocking.  SEK, you're the chief excecutive mocker of the internet, the king of all mockers, and the first dictator among Menckenesque mockers.  We need more like you.  I'll see what I can do. - TL

Suborn?  Does that word not mean what I think it means?  Or is the idea that anyone who would write this request wouldn't know what it means?

Would that I had Karl, would that I had.

And I slipped "suborn" in there, Rich, for that very reason.  What this person's written seems criminal, doesn't it?

So you're saying listserves are _not_ designed to do gradstudents' coursework for them?

I'm not how much I trust myself either.
