Granted, blogging is an exercise in solipsism.  

Granted, blogging about blogging is a narcissistic indulgence.

Granted, the repetition of a word as ugly as "blog" clogs paragraphs, each one a log jammed down the craw of some unsuspecting tributary.

Therefore, the following posts will be pompous, sound vainglorious and look beastly.  

You have been warned.

There are blog blogs. These are things we blog about that we blog. There are blog _un_blogs. That is to say, there are things that we blog that we don't blog _about_. But there are also unblog unblogs. There are things we don't blog about us not blogging.

Well, we blog what we know, and we all know blogs. I related my post on Bataille and Weil to blogs largely in an effort to help my readers to give a damn. Blogs are, you know, the one thing all bloggers have in common.

Rev up the blog, and start the dialogue.

Hey, that rhymes.

No one ever said I was a poet.
