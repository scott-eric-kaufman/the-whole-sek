## S'long as I'm Speaking Comics ...

I stumbled across this the other night, and it's been featured in my nightmares ever since:

[![Joker\_close\_up](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/18/joker\_close\_up.png "Joker\_close\_up")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/18/joker\_close\_up.png)

I'm not the only one who finds that deeply disturbing, am I?  The portrait's both compelling handsome and profoundly unsettling.  The scars to the cheeks remark equally of STD and the fell deaths of organized criminals.  Simply put, my dreams are haunted now [not by words](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/every-other-blo.html#comment-79583701), but by him, with his face. 

(I do have an item half-written about the literate dreaming of words, and will post it as soon as I've thought it through more.)

I think that face has its [origins](http://www.dreamwill.net/images/kakihara\_toon.jpg).

First Onibaba, now this.

Ah, the Joker...The least funny comic book character ever. I saw this image a couple of months ago, and it was definitely unsettling..."Wince-worthy".

Is it just the scarring that bothers you, or is it the smearing of the lipstick --- _something_ red --- far outside the boundaries of his mouth? I find it fascinating and compelling, but then again my eye has been trained by women's fashion magazines and Diane Arbus.

I think what bothers me is that the smeared lipstick covers the scars, as if some version of Jake's link has been "covered" by something which calls attention to thing it covers.  Like zit cream which no one tells you exacerbates the redness.  (Not that I'm trapped in junior high or anything.)

That said, the Necromancer's absolutely correct: the Joker was never funny, and when the writers let his failures in the humor department be known, he was a far more interesting character.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have the Creep.  Feel like shit and fond of puking, I am.  Stupid the Creep.
