## Glenn Beck is punk rock.

(_One last political post before I start pulling from the backlog of comics-related 
material I've written this week._)

I have a confession: I have never watched or listened to Glenn Beck 
for any sustained period of time. I’d read transcriptions of his 
rambling monologues and seen parodies of his lunatic shtick, but until 
today, I’d avoided prolonged exposure to the Glenn Beck Experience. 
Would that I could still say the same. As a public service to anyone 
else out there who might be tempted to try and understand his appeal, I 
offer the following transcript of the horrors I witnessed condensed down
 to their rhetorical appeals:

Good evening, America, I am you. Do you know what you 
hate? Let me tell you:

You hate it when people tell you what to think. Do you want to be told 
what to think? Let me tell you:

You don’t. You hate it when people tell you what to think. You’re 
an independent thinker, and what do all independent thinkers hate? Let 
me tell you:

You hate to be told what to think, because you're an independent 
thinker. How should you feel about being told what to think? Let me 
tell you:

You should feel insulted by these people who are telling you what to 
think. What does being talked down to by Washington elites make you 
feel like? Let me tell you:

Being talked down to by Washington elites makes you feel like a 
child. How should you feel when Washington elites treat you like a 
child? Let me tell you:

You should be outraged that Washington elites are trying to tell you 
how to live your life. How should you live your life? Let me tell you:

You should live your life with freedom, because you're an 
independent thinker. What should you do when condescending Washington 
elites treat you and other independents just like you like children? 
Let me tell you:

You should buy my book, because you're an independent thinker, and 
my book tells independent thinkers what they think.

To be honest, I expected something more. I assumed Jon Stewart’s 
parody of Beck was a parody, but I was wrong—the _Glenn Beck_ shows 
demonstrates that a significant number of American adults have the 
intellectual maturity of a punk apologist insisting that until you 
listen their favorite band, you’ll never learn to think for yourself. I
 honestly expected Beck to possess more rhetorical savvy than a teenage 
version of myself, but if you replace “America” with “the Replacements,”
 the resemblance is uncanny.

(_Before you say anything: I understand that I’m so late to the 
party that I shouldn’t even bother posting this, but I’ll risk 
inevitable redundancy in order to register the magnitude of my shock_.)

I described Beck just yesterday as primal scream therapy for bigots. And back when nice but somewhat unhappy people were doing primal scream therapy, I hated it already. he's amazingly labile, based on the little bits I know of, or pretends to be. And he also does that bad boy thing, like he's an adorable bratty 12 year old defying the teacher the other kids wished they could.

Conservatives never could have had any success without the creeps and bigots and morons, but until this year they kept them under control. (Though actually, they're still under control: this is a conservative coup d'etat by the Koch brothers, Dick Armey, and probably Grover Norquist.)

The supposedly sane conservatives are feigning regret at the moment, but they should have known what they were doing. They're worried that the conservative movement will be harmed, but it could be a lot bigger than just that.

Until you listen to my favorite band, Weasel Penis Orange, you don't even know what punk rock really is, you only think you do.
