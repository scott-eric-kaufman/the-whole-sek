The man you're about meet is named Oliver Crangle.  Mr. Crangle is a dealer in petulance and poison.  He's arbitrarily chosen four o'clock as his personal _Götterdämmerung_, and we are about to watch the metamorphosis of a twisted fanatic, poisoned by the gangrene of prejudice, to the status of someone who wrongly considers himself an avenging angel, upright and omniscient, dedicated and fearsome, despite being a twisted fanatic, poisoned by the gangrene of prejudice.  Whatever your clocks say, it's four o'clock—and wherever you are, it happens to be _The Twilight Zone_.

School superintendent?  This call is about a teacher in your employ.  His name is ... William J. Farwell.  The man is morally objectionable.  What?  Never mind who this is.  I happen to be giving you facts, and these facts are what are at issue.  You best check on him.  Immediately.

Nut!

_Crangle places a nut in Pete's bowl, then paces the room, first visibly agitated, then clearly enthused.  He consults [**Wikipedia**](http://www.wikipedia.org/)._

That's it!

That's it!  Four o'clock!  That's when we'll make it occur.  At that moment, that precise moment, we shall destroy evil.  This is both my charge and my obligation, to destroy evil.  And we shall do it at four o'clock!  I'm not quite sure of the method yet.  It will be the expiration of immorality.

_Enter Crangle's landlord, Mrs. Williams, who has recently received numerous  complaints about Crangle's vigorous support for Ron Paul from the proprieters of [**Obsidian Wings**](http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian\_wings/), [**Political Animal**](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/), and [**Instapundit**](http://instapundit.com/)._

Is that what you do all day?  Threaten people online about Ron Paul?

I don't threaten people, I compile them, investigate them, analyze them, categorize them, and then I judge them.  If they're impure and evil they must be punished.  If they are misled, or naïve, or unsophisticated, I point them the right way.  I will not countenance evil, I absolutely will not countenance evil.  There's nothing complicated about that.  They're evil.  All those little bugs out there, bacteria, that's what they are, those little—

That's it!  That's precisely it!  I knew I would get the clue.  Little people!  That's what I'll do.  I'll turn all the _evil_ people into _little_ ones.  I'll make every evil man two feet tall.  At four o'clock every evil man and woman will be precisely two feet tall.  They'll all be _two feet tall_!

Nut! _Fades to black.  Return to capture Crangle editing the **Wikipedia** page on the Gettysburg Address._

_There is a knock at the door.  Crangle crosses the room and FBI Agent Wood enters._

You dialed the Bureau an email about something big happening?
  

![image](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2155/1972938350\_2d7a5ab5d8.jpg?v=0)

I did, I did.  All the evil people in the world have banded together, Communists, subversives, thieves.  Now you see, I've spent many years, doing this kind of work, I've made a complete study of evil.  I listen to the radio, I watch television, I cut out newspaper clippings, I write emails to employers, I send them text messages late at night.

There's a most efficient method right there, texting these terrible people constantly late at night, waking them up, writing my charges, then doing it again.  Very frustrating for them.  They go out of their mind with fury.  They don't like to be woken up late at night.   

_Agent Wood squirms in annoyance._

To the point, to the point, it is now precisely three twenty-seven.  In exactly thirty-three minutes, all the evil people in the world will become half—no, a third their present size.  All the uncaught murderers and the tyrants, all the bullies, the wrong-doers, all of them, every one.  All the evil people will be little ones.

How do you go about doing this, shrinking people?
  

![image](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2330/1972938376\_4469feed93.jpg?v=0)

Why, I merely will it.  That's all.  In the past, several other methods of stopping evil from spreading occurred to me.  How does evil spread?  By public transport, so I had in mind removing all the stiffness from propellers, you understand, props hanging limp like empty banana skins; then it occurred to me I might change all the wheels in the world from round to square, or perhaps, triangular, so they'd stub in the asphault and stop.

_Exeunt Agent Wood with urgency.  Thirty minutes pass._

It's happening right now, everyone, all the evil ones, they're all turning into tiny little gnomes. _Nothing happens.  Fade to black.  It is now tomorrow morning.  Crangle picks up the Internet and begins dialing another email._

I'd like to speak to Mr. O'Connor please.  Hello, is this Mr. O'Connor?  You have a man working for you, a young man named Alfred Brewster, been with you a year and a half?  The man's a Commuist.  That's right, a subversive, a menace to our society, he should be discharged immediately.  Nevermind how I know, I just know.  I'm going to check back with you in a few days, and if he has not been discharged, I'm taking this whole matter to your superior.

Indeed, Pete, indeed.  At four o'clock, an evil man made his bed but did not lie in it; a pot called a kettle black but no one noticed; and a stone-thrower threw a stone in his glass house to no effect.  They say on the internet, no one knows you're a dog, but you don't have to be a dog to yap like one.  You can look for this one under "F" for "Failed," "J" for "Justice" and "T" for "Troll"—in _The Twilight Zone._
