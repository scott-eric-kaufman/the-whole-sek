_Dear Stan Slanders,_ 

_I spent this morning reading over my buddy's excellent first chapter.  It was very good.  I think he is smart.  But his chapter begins with an argument.  He assumes his readers will be interested in that argument because, well, because he is.  I know my buddy wants people to read his chapter, but I don't know how to tell him that most people find arguments boring.  What should I do?_

_Best,_

**Stan Slanders Replies:**

Thanks for sharing, A.C.E.P.H.A.L.O.U.S.  I've enclosed a check for $7.50 American (or $8,987.64 Canadian).  Maybe we _can_ save a couple Canadian scholars from the roaming Quebecois hordes.  Your question, however, demands a thoughtful response, but this'll have to suffice:

Of the many ways to open an academic essay, clearly the most traditional (among undergraduates) is to recapitulate in words the opening scenes of Stanley Kubrick's _2001: A Space Odyssey_.  Inform your reader that they're witnessing [The Dawn of Man](http://digilander.libero.it/stanleykubrick/2001/images/dawn01.jpg).  Talk about this (figurative) primitive human society--_e.g._ America before the advent of academic feminism or Western Culture before the fall of imperialism--and show some (figurative) [ape-men](http://digilander.libero.it/stanleykubrick/2001/images/2001-carne.jpg) fiddling around with some (figurative) bones.  Discuss how [violent](http://digilander.libero.it/stanleykubrick/2001/images/dawn06.jpg) these (figurative) ape-men became after the arrival of something [strange](http://www.sippe-w.de/assets/images/2001-mono2.gif), [unusual](http://home.millsaps.edu/~mcelvrs/BF.jpg) or [otherwise discomfiting](http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~ssen/Snapshots1.jpg).  Cue _Also Sprach Zarathustra_.  Show how the new thing provokes a [frenzied](http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2000/02/03/2001\_1.jpg) [rage](http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2000/02/03/2001\_2.gif) from the (figurative) ape-men.  Loose the [bone](http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2000/02/03/2001\_3.gif)!  Seamlessly jump-cut to a (figurative) [spaceship](http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2000/02/03/2001\_4.gif) following the same graceful trajectory and you have written the mother of all introductions.  (Essays introduced in this manner are often [difficult](http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/2001/icons/brainroom.jpg) to conclude.  Final paragraphs alternately [baffle](http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/filmprog/images/2004tricky/film\_pic01.jpg), [entrance](http://www.celtoslavica.de/chiaroscuro/films/2001/4j.jpg) and [stupify](http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/2001/icons/stargate.jpg) readers.)

Yours in Academic Vice, Virtue and Vitriol,

Stan Slanders

I totally agree with Stan Slanders's advice.  In fact, Slanders is in agreement with another well-known writer, who states, "a hideous green pseudopod crawls toward the cordon of troops and suddenly sshhlop! wipes out an entire observation post with a deluge of some disgusting orange mucus in which the unfortunate men are \*digested\*.  Pirate/Osmo's mission is to establish liaison with the Adenoid."

As always, an insightful comment from Zim.  In fact, I think what you've posted has been within all our minds; I appreciate someone having the guts to finally come out and say it.

I disagree with Mr. Wanker about the merits of Zim's post.  While Zim himself is a fair-minded, independent, well-meaning thinker, his message contains an unconscious (dare I say it) racism that would repulse a Goebbels.  Why describe Pirate/Osmo in strictly neutral language while using much more vivid, colorful imagery to characterize the Adenoid, to wit:  "hideous green psuedopod," "disgusting orange mucus"?

At last, I am putting the finishing touches on the 110th revision of my Ellison/Myrdal chapter.  NOW it is going to be perfect.  I am not going to let my adviser change a word...not a word!!

Invader Zim, I'm only going to say this once: Put down the Pynchon and step away from the blow.  You don't need it, nor is it appropos to what I've written here.  (Except for the blow.  It's obviously irritating the Adenoid and probably has something to do with those final sequences of _2001: A Space Odyssey_.  Or not.  The first posters advertised it as ["The Ultimate Trip"](http://images.allposters.com/images/PF/PF\_980782.jpg).)
