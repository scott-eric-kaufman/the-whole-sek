## Alito Cattivo; or, the Rare (But Still Only Quasi-)Political Post

This morning [I mocked myself](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/happy\_halloween.html#comment-10768224) for being unable to learn languages or play musical instruments:
The Little Womedievalist is not just beautiful, she's also extremely
talented. She's one of those people who pick up languages (she's up to
sixteen now and is learning Latin as we speak) in a day and play
fourteen musical instruments. I, on the other hand, played high school
baseball and soccer and now blog. 

The comparison looks worse if it's direct: I took four years of
Latin (which I have largely forgotten) as an undergraduate, only speak
English fluently and once "played" the bass guitar for a year before
realizing that rhythm sections are best peopled by people with rhythm.
You don't know the depths of my unworthiness.

I fudged that account to deepen the self-deprication.  I know Italian.  I can read it and do a deaf approximation of speaking it.  (By which I mean: The only time I ever wore my hearing aids regularly was when I spent three months in Italy.  But because I didn't spend eight years in Italian speech therapy, I'm sure I sounded like some arrogant American to those Italians I desperately tried to communicate with.  _C'est la vie._   I also know French.   You would too if you'd grown up in Louisiana and sat through eight years of it.  Which, if you don't know, they make you do in Louisiana.  It's a required subject from elementary through high school.  But I digress.)  I want to talk politics here, because [my President has nominated a man named "Alito"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/31/AR2005103100180.html) to be the next [Associate Justice of the Supreme Court](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/31/AR2005103100227.html).  

I lived in Italy for three months, so I'm an expert.  (The wife lived in Italy for almost three years.  She verifies my translation.)  The thing is, the Italians I know only ever say "alito" when paired with "cattivo," which means (_drums rolling_) "bad breath."  From what I can tell, "alito" itself is nearly an archaism, one which has survived solely because of its embedment in that particular colloquialism.  What does it say about President Bush that the name of his nominee's cognate to h_alito_sis?  (Get it‽  Get it‽)  (Before you ask, I did indeed deploy the [interrobang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang).  Wouldn't you‽)  (Where's my [language hat](http://languagehat.com/) when I need it?)  (What is with these parenthesis?)  (If every sentence I write is parenthetical, do I even have a point?)  (Or am I endlessly digressing?)  (Or should I refrain from posting while under the influence of strong cold medicine imbibed in doses double the recommendations?)  

Back to the point: When one's ethnic heritage amounts to foul emenations from an unwashed mouth, perhaps one ought to consider changing one's name.  If confirmed, he will ride this bench _for life_.  He may be [Scalito](http://www.law.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/Preview&c=LawArticle&cid=1130499501705) but I doubt even his ostensible intellectual forebear wants to bench up next to [Mr. The Sweet Tang of Vomit Mouth](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,173968,00.html).  The answer lurks in the ethnic heritage the New York Times [tried to sick away](http://confederateyankee.mu.nu/archives/130147.php).  [Alito](http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/050719/19alito.htm) represents diversity!  He is an [ethnic Catholic](http://volokh.com/archives/archive\_2005\_10\_30-2005\_11\_05.shtml#1130797431).  One hundred years ago he wouldn't have been considered a white person.  (Neither would an Irishman like Ted Kennedy.)  Bush wants to create a public free of the prejudices it no longer holds.  He wants to bring attention to the slow march of Racial Harmony.  "Look," he says, "[I've nominated a candidate](http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/10/31/scotus.bush/index.html) who your great-great-grandparents would've called a nigg ... would not have invited in for crumpets.  Look at all our progress?  Aren't we the bees' knees?  I think we are.  If you don't, then the terrorists have already won."

I believe the next few weeks will see this sparkling example of all that is hard-core Caucasian trumpeted as a "minority candidate."  We shall see.  For tonight, I will hide my face from the foul wind and phantoms flickering across my monitor and slather it—my face, not my monitor—with as much Vaporub as my nigh burning eyes can handle.

There are currently five Catholics on the Supreme Court:

So maybe those anti-Papist great-great grandparents were right all along - Rome was silently plotting to take over America.

For the love of God, nobody tell Jack Chick that the Catholics have a majority on the S.C. now. He's already foaming-at-the-mouth insane enough as is. I'd link to examples but it's 1:30 and I'm tired. Suffice to say there's anti-Catholic hilarity aplenty in the wonderful world of Chick tracts; I leave it to the reader as an exercise to find some.

On the contrary: _everyone_ tell Jack Chick that &c.
