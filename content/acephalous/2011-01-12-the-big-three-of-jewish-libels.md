Via [the incomparable Carl Pyrdum](http://www.gotmedieval.com/2011/01/libels-blood-and-otherwise-a-quick-primer.html):

My only worry is that in all this hubbub, the indexical value of “blood  libel” is being overlooked.  The reason why we need a special phrase  like “blood libel” to denote lies told about what Jews do with the blood  of baby Christians is the sheer number of libels which Jews have had to  contend over the years.

He gets to the "ass libel" and the "leper libel" soon enough.   (No, [neither of us is kidding](http://books.google.com/books?id=tVbzRfhBwCEC&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206&dq=%!l(MISSING)eper+libel%!&(MISSING)source=bl&ots=TalN3JH84O&sig=--8Z3jf2uakirTtSHGwFWjOZMAg&hl=en&ei=UkcuTbT2D5G4sQObqMmPBw&sa=X&oi=book\_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%!l(MISSING)eper%!l(MISSING)ibel%!&(MISSING)f=false).)
