**SEK:** Time to put this quarter to bed!

[![Demoted\_virgil](../../images/acephalous/6a00d8341c2df453ef01287654ce7a970c-500wi "Demoted\_virgil")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01287654ce7a970c-pi) 

Remember that time when I ate all my food but had a hairball and threw it all up? Me neither. 

**SEK:** No, I actually do, [demoted-Virgil](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/12/on-cats-wrists-david-foster-wallace-buffy-alums-muslims-pork-chops-and-beer.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a739e89d970b#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a739e89d970b), as it was only an hour ago. I also remember giving you kitty-laxative, which means we have to wait to feed you for a while.

It disturbs me that I will not be eating right this very second.

**SEK:** I can see that, but you still need to wait a few hours before you can eat.

BUT I'M HUNGRY NOW!

**SEK:** I can see that, but you're still going to have to wait. Now, where was I? That's right. I was putting the quarter to—

BUT I'M HUNGRY NOW!

**SEK:** Why don't you play with your brother somewhere that is else? (_SEK picks Virgil up and relocates him to the living room. He then returns to the office and closes the door behind him._) As I was saying, it's time to put this quarter to bed! Just need to log into the Electronic Educational Environment (**EEE**) and start inputting grades.

[![Demoted\_virgil2](../../images/acephalous/6a00d8341c2df453ef01287654d22d970c-500wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01287654d22d970c-pi)  

(_muffled_) BUT I'M HUNGRY NOW!

**SEK:** Much better. (_SEK finishes tallying his students' grades on Class Communities Assignments and presses "Save."_)

**EEE:** You have been automatically logged out of me.

**SEK:** Why?

**EEE:** Because.

**SEK:** Motherfuck!

**EEE:** [Not even with your discs](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=not%20even%20with%20your%20dick).

**SEK:** What?

[![Demoted\_virgil2](../../images/acephalous/6a00d8341c2df453ef01287654d32f970c-500wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01287654d32f970c-pi)  

(_muffled_) BUT I'M HUNGRY NOW!

**SEK:** Are you talking shit?

**EEE:** Are you accusing me of talking shit?

(_muffled_) BUT I'M HUNGRY NOW!
 

**SEK:** What if I am? What are you going to do about it?

**EEE:** I'm going to log you out again is what! 

_EEE logs SEK out again._

**SEK:** Motherfuck!  __ 

_SEK's cellphone rings and he answers it._ 

**SEK:** Hello? What? No, I'm not selling school furniture. No, I didn't place an ad there. What? Yes, that _is_ my old telephone number, but I'm not selling fifty lab tables treated with Wilsonart® Chemsurf® chemical-laminate. Sorry I can't help. 

_Turns off cellphone._

**SEK:** Now, where was I again? That's right, I was about to re-input the Class Community Assignments into my electronic gradebook.

_SEK's cellphone rings and he answers it._

**SEK:** Hello? What? No, seriously, I'm _sure_ I'm not selling fifty lab tables treated with Wilsonart® Chemsurf® chemical-laminate. If had any tables, believe you me, I'd—

(_muffled_) BUT I'M HUNGRY NOW!
 

**SEK:** (_becoming visibly agitated_) Why would I lie about that? If I had the tables, I'd sell them to—no, seriously, if you want to give me the money, I won't turn it down, but you won't be receiving any tables in return, because I don't—no, I'm most definitely _not_ threatening to defraud you of—

_SEK's cellphone goes dead._

**SEK:** _Mother_—

_A
loud crash, as if millions of dinner-plates suddenly cried out in
terror and were suddenly shattered, is heard behind the office door_.

**SEK:** _What the_—

**I AM VIRGIL SCOURGE OF COUNTER-TOPS AND ENEMY OF CERAMIC PLATES AND I HAVE FOUND YOU WANTING! NOW FEED ME OR ELSE!**

**SEK:** Or else what?

_Another
loud crash. SEK rushes out of the office and into the kitchen. The
remains of a fine and noble plate are scattered across the floor. The
Scourge is nowhere in sight._ 

**SEK:** VIRGIL!

_Virgil casually walks up from behind SEK, peeks around his leg, and innocently surveys the damage in the kitchen._

[![Demoted\_virgil](../../images/acephalous/6a00d8341c2df453ef01287654dd16970c-500wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01287654dd16970c-pi) 
 
How did that happen? By the way, remember that time when I ate all my food but had a hairball and threw it all up? Because I don't and now I'm hungry again so could you feed me please?

_SEK's cellphone rings. As he turns to answer it, Virgil jumps back on the counter._

**SEK:** Hello? _For the last time,_ I'm _sure_ I'm not selling fifty lab tables treated with Wilsonart® Chem—

**I AM VIRGIL SCOURGE OF COUNTER-TOPS AND ENEMY OF CERAMIC PLATES AND I HAVE FOUND YOU WANTING! NOW FEED ME OR ELSE!**

_The kitchen explodes. As does the cellphone. EEE logs SEK out (just because it can). As the stage fades to black, a man_—_not SEK, but some much less manly one_—_begins to weep uncontrollably._

Try month-old twins sometime.  And I'm a sub for a class where the Professor first left nothing then, under pressure from the administration, left an indecipherable mass of something.

_And a borderline personality disorder._

As you well know, the two ain't mutually exclusive.

_Kittens!!!!!!! Awwwww. Why would you be playing with the stupid internet grading thingy when you could be feeding them?_

That's easy!  Because of this:

Virgil has aspirations, and I live to see them go unfulfilled.

Either I'm paranoid or the world's conforming to my paranoid expectations, because earlier today I decided to catch up on my professional reading, and one of the articles I read was called “Post-Keynesianism without modernity,” published in the latest (at least on this side of the pond) _Cambridge Journal of Economics_, and you know who wrote it?

Colin Danby. 

I'm not sure whether this Colin Danby is that Colin Danby, but even so, I suddenly feel the need to stop reading blogs and start in on that pile of unread journals in the den...

It is my misfortune to have a phone number that used to belong to [major auto-repair chain].  Despite it being my number for 3 years now, I still get woken up early most weekends by people wanting to schedule work.  To belabor the obvious, people who think looking up phone numbers in a very old phone book is a good idea are often to dumb to get that numbers can change.  The easiest solution is to tell them that of course they can come in at noon, as there is no wait whatsoever.
