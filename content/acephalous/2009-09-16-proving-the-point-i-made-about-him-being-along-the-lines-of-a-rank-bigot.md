## Proving the point I made about him being along the lines of a rank bigot . . .

. . . Dan Riehl twits along the lines of this tonight:

[![Assphallus](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a573892a970b-500wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a573892a970b-pi) 

Someone, it seems, neglected to tell him that the default insult for the likes of those along the lines of _Acephalous_ is to say that he are "headless" and thus "dumbly."  But, however, instead of if going for the quasi-intelligent _pro forma_ insult, Riehl pulled on a full-homophobe . . . which is, of course, the very thing I [went after him in the first place for the line of which for](http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous\_conservative/2009/09/a-912-experience-dangerous-times.html) that would be, you know.

Please everyone congratulate him into it!

I'm surprised that Republicans go with "intertubes," since the term was inspired by much-mocked (and now disgraced) Republican senator Ted Stevens.  Maybe they don't realize that?

"duh!@Acephalous"?  Does that mean that Riehl is saying that it should have already been obvious that he was a rank bigot before his last post?  

I guess he does have a point there.

Ass phallus?!  Hahahahahahaha!!  That's great... what, did it take him all night to come up with that one.  I can imagine it was inspired around the eight Budweiser.  That's probably the part of his post that he thinks is witty.
