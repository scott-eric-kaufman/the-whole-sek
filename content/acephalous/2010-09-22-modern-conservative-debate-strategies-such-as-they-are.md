“Comedian” [Tim Slagle](http://twitter.com/timslagle) wrote a [post](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/tslagle/2010/09/22/petas-rock-star-chinese-are-sub-species/) slagging Morrissey for calling the Chinese a “[subspecies](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/sep/03/morrissey-china-subspecies-racism)”  for “their” treatment of animals.  I’m with Slagle on the condemnation,  though I’m not as surprised as he seems to be that Morrissey would say  or write something controversial.  It’s not like he’s written [a song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFSt\_7xmxag&feature=related) from the perspective of a young man flirting with organized racism or [another](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsq3H\_6XuFA) in which he imagined putting Thatcher to the guillotine or anything.   In short, color me unsurprised that Morrissey’s courting controversy as a  means of bringing attention to a cause—the unethical treatment of  animals in China—he’s only supported since he was eleven.  Is his remark  vile?  Of course it is.  That’s not the point.

The point is that Slagle, [is a terrible writer](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/11/what-is-it-with-students-and-with-commas.html),  and also that, his particular form of cultural illiteracy is, a sign of  things to come.  I’m not bagging on the man because he clearly knows  nothing about Morrissey, or because he thinks being a woman is an insult  (“his current diet … is obviously too high in soy-estrogen”), or even  because of his aforementioned problem with, the written word.  His brand  of cultural ignorance bothers me because Wikipedia exists.  Claiming  that a band that broke up [in 1987](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Smiths#Strangeways.2C\_Here\_We\_Come\_and\_break-up) “put out several gloomy pop albums in the late eighties and early  nineties” is not only factually incorrect, it suggests a mind as  incurious as it is lazy and ignorant.  Simply put, cultural critics  should know something about the culture they criticize, as well as a  little something about the ones they find it politically convenient to  defend.  For example: Buddhism did not originate in China and is not a “cult.”  That  Slagle defends the Chinese against Morrissey’s racist remarks with a  demonstration of his ignorance about all things Chinese would be amusing  were “the reverse _tu quoque_” a little less common.

As you know, the classic _tu quoque_ works like this:

**Person X:** It should be illegal to put babies on spikes.  
 **Person Y:** But I just saw you put a baby on a spike!

In this example, Person Y tries to undermine the argument of Person X  by calling him a hypocrite.  This is, obviously, a fallacy.  But in a  world in which people [stand by SASQUATCH ISRAEL](http://www.sadlyno.com/archives/33231.html), the only way to improve a fallacious argument is, it seems, to double down on it. The reverse _tu quoque_, then, goes something like this:

**Person X:** It should be illegal to put babies on spikes.  
 **Person Y:** (_putting a baby on a spike_) But I just saw you put a baby on a spike!

In this example, Person Y tries to undermine the argument of Person X by calling him a hypocrite _while doing the very thing he claims to want undermined_.  Because it requires a demonstrable act of self-refutation, the reverse _tu quoque_ should only be attempted by the brave, and even then only when speaking to the stupid.  Because the rest of us?  We see 
through
 it.  Not that that will stop people from using it, especially when, as is the case over there, [it seems to be an editorial imperative](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/03/john-noltes-outraged-on-behalf-of-topless-women-everywhere.html).

The Eddie Izzard material vastly improved my enjoyment of this post.

That is all.

I tried to link to that, but all the clips I could find had cut that bit out and spliced all the European history material together.
