Acephalous, CA:  Residents of the quiet Los Angeles suburb of Acephalous were stunned to learn that a barrel containing the murdered bodies of 38 fish had been found by children playing in an abandoned building on the corner of Academia and The CFP Follies.  All 38 are believed to be known associates of the Cultural Logic of Brad Pitt Cartel.  Authorities have not yet released the cause of death, but preliminary reports indicate they were shot with a large-caliber handgun sometime around 1:17 p.m. on the afternoon of May 8th.  Although no suspects are in custody, APD Police Chief Roger Wilco believes the case will be resolved quickly.  "This is a small town.  Everybody knows everybody else," he said.  "Sooner or later something will turn up."

You can tell I'm from Jersey because I don't believe in the letter "r."
