What is it about airplanes that turns average Americans into readers?  As I made my rounds on the flight from Ronald Reagan National to George Bush Intercontinental I noticed people reading [Stephen King](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)1880418592%!F(MISSING)qid%!D(MISSING)1136342293%!F(MISSING)sr%!D(MISSING)8-8%!F(MISSING)ref%!D(MISSING)pd\_bbs\_8)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1), [Brian Greene](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0375708111)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1), [Robert Jordan](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0312873077)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) and even [Joan Didion](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)140004314X)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1).  On the flight from George Bush Intercontinental to John Wayne Airport I noted two fellow flyers reading Kenneth Davis' [_Don't Know Much About History_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0060083824)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) with more than a hint of self-satisfaction, one bored soul flipping the pages of Doris Kearns Goodwin's [_Team of Rivals_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0684824906)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) with obvious disdain and one man sighing (with pleasure? in exasperation?) as he cut a swath through [_Freakonomics_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)006073132X)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1).  

How should one react to this crass manifestation of reading for pleasure?  Praise people for not staring at the back of a seat for hours on end?  Castigate them for not being able to afford a soon-to-be-ubiquitous personal DVD player?  Or mock them for choosing to cram works of contested quality into the few airborne hours of their lives?  

To my mind, the only reasonable response consists of buying more things to jumpstart the American economy so more people will fly more frequently and therefore read more frequently thus enriching our economy _and_ raising the general informedness of The People.  Then and only then can we be certain the words "President Jeb" will never pass our lips.  

Political literacy may begin in the home.  

It is certainly maintained in the pressurized cabin.

You should avoid eye contact and speak in soothing tones.  They're probably nervous fliers hyped up on terror alerts and beltless security checks who're just looking for distraction.

I've been selling used books for a living for almost 20 years.  I've tried hundreds of times to sell "Freefall" (nonfiction about the 767 that ran out of gas over Gimli Ontario) to airport bound people and have only succeeded twice.  I live in hope that one flight I'll end up sitting next to someone with that kind of a sense of humour.
