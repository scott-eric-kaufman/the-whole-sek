**I. Violence  
**

Last night at approximately 3 a.m., I'd swathed my head with [these puppies](http://www.sennheiserusa.com/newsite/productdetail.asp?transid=004974) and was about fifteen seconds into this clip:

[](http://www.youtube.com/v/sHdDpuV40uo&hl=en&fs=1)[](http://www.youtube.com/v/sHdDpuV40uo&hl=en&fs=1)[](http://www.youtube.com/v/sHdDpuV40uo&hl=en&fs=1)


When three sleeping cats simultaneously popcorned three feet straight up then stared at the door.  I doffed my headphones and ran to the door to stop the mad rapist or sullen murder who'd attempted to break it down and scared my cats.  I put my eye to the peephole and saw a woman across the way sprawled out on the walkway.  Tears streamed down her face.  Between my peephole and her door stood a man of no small stature. 

He loomed over her. 

She mumbled language while he glowered.  I stood behind my door voyeuring.  Didn't know what to do.  So I ran—in the way people with crippling chest congestion run, _i.e._ hilariously—back to the bedroom and woke the wife.  We dashed back to the front door and peered through our peephole but they were gone.  

At least she was.  

I could feel him pacing on the landing between the first and second floors.  

I'm not sure what happened.  She could've been drunk and he could've been on the side of angels.  That seems the likeliest scenario, given that there was no yelling after she hit the floor.  (I don't know from before, what with the headphones and all.)  I thought about going over there today and saying something about if they needed to move things at 3 a.m. I'm usually up and am more than happy to orchestrate other people lifting heavy objects.

Then I thought better of it.  I'm really not sure what to do and/or what I should've done.  

**II. Heat  
**

Cats can't taste heat.  Nor does it have any effect on their digestion.  How do I know?  

Last night [this little man](http://acephalous.typepad.com/finnegan.jpg) ran off with some buffalo wings drenched in _[sriracha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sriracha)_.  He neither mewled like a cat in pain nor had any other issues later.  From this I surmise cats' tongues can't tell from [Scoville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville\_scale).  Lard their food with [capsaicin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin) and they'll not mind a wit so long as there's lard in there.  (Or so I hope.  I don't want to clean that up.  Would you?)

Similarly, birds--at least, parrots--are unaffected by pepper oils.

The above is in fact the evolutionary purpose of pepper oils. Mammals will digest pepper seeds, and birds will excrete them whole to germinate, so it's advantageous to the pepper plant to keep the mammals away.

Cats probably don't eat peppers in the wild, which might explain it if they aren't affected.

Sriracha is for me the emblem of why I was happy to return to California.  In March 1989, I visited Berkeley to check out computer science grad school.  A friend put me up (in downtown Oakland), and one day we went out to lunch in the south-of-campus zone....the cheap greasy Vietnamese eats with sriracha (plus Taqueria de Berkeley on Kittredge) showed me I was not mistaken in deciding to return.

Thank God for [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abie%!E(MISSING)2%99s\_Irish\_Rose).  I'd never understood that joke either---and now I know why.

And I figured the cats + peppers = nada had something to do with the curviness of digestive tracts, but it's nice to see my folk biology validated by actual science.

Important scientific note:   

Cats are not birds.  

Also, cats are in fact mammals.

Also, perhaps your cat simply enjoys spicy food.  I know I do.  Perhaps I am your cat.

May I kindly request you limit urine excretion to the pre-approved micturition areas, then?

Wikipedia is a cavern of wonders.  Not that I approve of dramatic representations of Jews and Gentiles getting married.  It might lead to it happening in real life.

Oy.  For the Jewish half of this, post-mid-century, your parents bring out the big guns.  At least, mine did.  "If you don't marry a Jewish girl, then Hitler wins."  I hadn't been exposed to Godwin's Law at that point, but I still felt somehow that this argument was a bit unreasonable.

Scott once told me the term for a gentile guy who marries a Jewish woman, but I've forgotten what it is.  It might have been _shegetz_, although [wikipedia's entry on the word](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shegetz) ('...literally translates as "rascal", "scoundrel" or "varmint" ...') makes it sound pretty negative.  Except for varmint.  I like the thought of being called a varmint.

Also: I'm trying to imagine the English equivalent of Rich's parental emotional half-nelson.  Possibly 'if you don't marry an English girl, then William the Conqueror wins.'  Except that William the Conqueror _did_ win.  (And Rachel is an English girl).  I suppose, conceivably: 'if you don't marry an _Anglo Saxon_ girl, then William the Conqueror wins.'

I don't think that there really is an English equivalent, thankfully.  I could see, perhaps, somebody English dating a German woman and his parents telling him "if you marry her, then Hitler wins", but the total effect would be a lot more risible.

Speaking of which, I remember when one of my elder brothers went on a hike through Europe (during college, I think).  He apparently dated a German woman for a while during his trip, or something, because we got a phone call at our house for him from her.  I remember her weeping over the phone to me about how sorry she was about what people in Germany had done to the Jews.  I mean, sheesh.  I could easily imagine what my brother had gotten out of it, but I was only something like 14 at the time, and I thought I was a little young to be involved in her kink.

Neil Gaiman had a great scene in _Sandman_ that was similar, come to think of it.  Hob Gadling, the immortal, is going on and on to his girlfriend about how guilty the English really are for the slave trade.  She says "this is the first time you've dated a black woman, isn't it" and when he says yes, and how do you know, she says something about how if he had she would already have told him off about it.  Of course, the scene is saved from banality by her not knowing that he's an immortal who really did get rich off of slavery, and that his guilt is actually personal.

I should add that I only hang-out (virtually) with people like Scott and Rich so that I can truthfully preface my frequent, vilely antisemitic comments with 'look, some of my best friends are Jews, but ...'
