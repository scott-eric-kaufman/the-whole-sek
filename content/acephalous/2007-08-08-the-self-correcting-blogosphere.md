Two days ago, I told a [story](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/how-to-remove-a.html) about having to have a toilet seat removed from my head by the jaws of life.  I mentioned that the people who removed it knew my father, because he was also on the rescue squad.

Two days later, the mysterious "alkau" [fleshed out](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/how-to-remove-a.html#comment-78713952) my story.  Since this happened in Alberta, these firefighters didn't know my father.  He was only a paramedic when we lived in New Jersey.  I thought this happened in New Jersey.  I must've been confusing this with the time the firefighters were called to my parents' house [eight] days after I was born ... when my dad was on call.  Can you imagine that?  There you are, playing cards with the other paramedics, and a call squawks in: "Fire reported at [your address]."  I wasn't even a week old before my knack for getting myself into "situations" outed itself.  

Back to the topic at hand: I didn't _lie_ when I implied this happened in New Jersey.  Nor did the mysterious "alkau" lie when she said my head had been extricated by the jaws-of-life.  But, as the equally mysterious "jlkau" [informs us](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/how-to-remove-a.html#comment-78751680), she was mistaken.  Seems trained rescue personnel would not use something with "[an incredible 195,126 lbs. of cutting force](http://www.airshore.com/Main/Products,424,424,0.aspx)" anywhere near the head of a small child unless he were trapped in the crushed hulk of a burning vehicle.

This blog is now made of truth.

As long as the truth is told.....the house fire was on New Year's Eve...so that would make you 8 days old and your father was at the scene of an accident, but the rest is true, you always had a way of getting into trouble. It is also true that the Rescue Squad did know what happened in Alberta and for awhile you were called "potty head", which made you laugh because you thought you were soooooo funny.
