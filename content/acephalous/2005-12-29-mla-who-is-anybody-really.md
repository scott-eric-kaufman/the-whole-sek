## MLA: Who Is Anybody Really?

People I don't know know me.  I met someone who didn't feel comfortable revealing her online handle to me but she's obviously familiar with my work.  I don't think she's lying either, since she introduced herself to me.  It also brings up an interesting question:

Are some ordinary names actually handles?  Is "Adam Kotsko" _really_ Adam Kotsko?  Is he actually Tom Smith or Jason Jones?  I ask because as I tried to coordinate the conversation I was currently having with ones I've had in comment sections past it occured to me that real-sounding names are neither more nor less likely to be real than obvious pseudonyms.  So whoever you are online, Early Afternoon Interlocutor, know that you have blown the stitches of my world.  (Not that it didn't need it.)

"ben wolfson", as I've stated more than a few times at unfogged, is a pseudonym.

Real-sounding names make much better pseudonyms than fake-sounding names, because you never get morons telling you to put your real name to your words if you really believe them.

My online name is my real name. Sometimes I wonder about the wisdom of using my real name online. When it comes down to it, though, I feel comfortable attaching my real name to my words, even when I'm being bitchy and irrational (which unfortunately occurs more than I'd like). 

Oh, I also use "Tripmaster" occasionally as a handle (on forums and such), but it would take all of five minutes to trace the name back to me.

Sometimes initials can be pseudonyms, too.

I was adopted, so I have a built-in pseudonym.

I think it's dishonest to go by a seemingly real name that isn't, unless you're careful to make sure everybody who reads you knows it. Typically it's an unintentional and innoccuous dishonesty, but it's still dishonest because it misleads and in particular because you ought to know it misleads.

You seem to be running into and attending talks by bloggers. How largely does the blogosphere loom at the MLA? And is it a sort of inside secret of those who blog and read blogs, or is it something that pretty much anybody is liable to mention?
