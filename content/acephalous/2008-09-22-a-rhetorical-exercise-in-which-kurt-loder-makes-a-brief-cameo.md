## A rhetorical exercise in which Kurt Loder makes a brief cameo*

So a guy [writes a song](http://web.archive.org/web/19970614024604/http://www.mtv.com/news/gallery/s/wirsmashing970502.html):
At one point I found myself going, "I can't write a song about Batman,
I'm in an alternative band." And I thought this is stupid, if I can
write a song about Batman and it serves the purpose . . . and connects with something that
is unique and original, then, why not? . . . I was trying to represent Batman.

The director of the video says this:
But [the guy] really wanted to explore Batman's brain.

The result is this:

How did Corgan propose getting inside Batman's head?  _By getting inside Batman's head_.  Given that the video was for [_Batman on Ice_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\_&\_Robin\_(film))—a.k.a. _The Curious Case of [the Governor](http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00018/ed\_imgRSNN1921XX\_18681a.jpg) and [Mr. Nipples](http://picturepoetry.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/batman-nipples.jpg)_—I'm not sure there's much _there_ in there to be filled out.  This is Batman as camp, so [the lyrics](http://209.85.173.104/search?q=cache:mFlGKOFNbfEJ:www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/smashingpumpkins/theendisthebeginningistheend.html+smashing+pumpkins+the+end+is+the+beginning&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=7&gl=us&client=firefox-a) contain all the psychological depth and insight of [the television series](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RqxHQOG7w).  And yet:

Ain't it funny how the film the song advertises influences our take on the lyrics?\*\*  The camp of Schumacher's _Batman & Robin_ is buried beneath the literalism of Zack Snyder's adaptation of _Watchmen_.  And where did fans first see this preview?  Before _The Dark Knight_.  (A film whose complexities a Doctor of Philosophy of English [affirms](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/07/the-dark-knight.html).)  Where am I headed with this?  

An exercise in visual rhetoric for my upcoming course.  (About which more momentarily.)  They'll already have seen _Batman Begins_ and read _Watchmen_, so they should be able to handle the tone and source material aspect of the conversation.

\*The MTV News item I quote here begins with Kurt Loder saying: "The band also gets to shoot a tie-in video for the song, and Chris Connelly stopped by the set to ask the question, 'Have you guys sold out, or what?'"  Cut to the report.  Upon returning, Kurt Loder says: "Joining the Pumpkins on the 'Batman' soundtrack will be R. Kelly, Jewel, and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony among others."  I officially miss Kurt Loder now.

\*\*Yes, I know it's been remixed, and that plays a part in it, but bear with me here.

I'm not sure that I'm willing to let go of that just yet, nor am I sure that it obviates your point to be aware of it. The first version is a screechy self-parody (of good music, anyway; I don't know from Smashing Pumpkins, myself) rhetorically (in a broad sense of rhetoric) appropriate to the movie; the second version is a self-important drama-fest, also very appropriate to the movie (as I understand it: Watchmen is one of the 80s classics I still haven't read\*). 

Also, I think the fact that the lyrics are plural just makes it that much more appropriate for the second movie.

\* I have _got_ to figure out some way to get more interesting readings into my courses. History and influence of _manga_, maybe.

The lyrics are typically terrible --- if anyone's responsible for how awful emo became, it's Corgan.  The music?  Sonically wonderful, noisy-beautiful, whatever.  And Corgan's voice, bad as it is, was good-bad.  But Lord Almighty, if you paid attention the lyrics, you learned more about Cupids and vampires than you ever wanted to.  Not Led Zeppelin laughable, but pretty damn close.  

That said, you really ought to read _Watchmen_.  In fact . . . check your email.

Actually, I think that the music in the Watchman version were also on B&R; they just were not released as a single. The inclusion of them in Watchman does not speak well for the rest of the film.

ASK, I'm conflicted as to how I feel about augurs of _Watchmen_.  On the one hand, Alan Moore distancing himself from it is _pro forma_ at this point; on the other, Zack Snyder's a visual literalist, and the interview I read with Dave Gibbons indicated that the film is, in fact, slavish in its devotion to his panels.  But I don't know whether that's a good thing --- it's a better thing than what happened with _300_, but that's mostly because Miller's book was crap before he got his hands on it.  I was talking to [_a recent UCI Ph.D._] who said his only problem with the trailer was that it indicated Snyder wouldn't take characterization too seriously . . . but he did cast Billy Crudup, who I really like, and who (outside of Night Owl) is the only character whose depth has any, um, _depth_ to it, so I'm not sure about that.

Put another way, this is a rare instance in which I think ignoring medium and being slavish devoted to source material might work out well.  This is only because Gibbons' contributions to the book were so vital, so a lot of the storytelling load we'd expect in exposition is handled by the staging of scenes --- the placement of a particular photograph, the out-of-focus reaction shot, &c. --- all of which should translate well on film.  But this is (maybe) just wishful thinking on my part, really.

Well, the use of the song is ironic. I _really_ don't care for the song at all, and using it to advertise _Watchmen_ was like slathering on more sauce than necessary. When I heard it in the trailer, I was waiting for Don LaFontaine to announce "In a world filled with _darkness_ and _chaos_..."

I'd rather read the book than watch the movie. If all Zack Snyder is going to do is animate the panels of the book with his signature _slow_-fast-_slow_ motion style and green screen effects, why watch the movie? How is seeing it on the big screen going to be different than (or supplementary to?) reading it? It looks like another attempt by studios to cash in on a comic book with a fan base guaranteed to purchase tickets. 

I'd have to see more footage, but more importantly I have to read the damn book.
