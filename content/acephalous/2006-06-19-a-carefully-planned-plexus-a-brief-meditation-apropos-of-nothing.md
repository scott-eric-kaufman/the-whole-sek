## A Carefully Planned Plexus—A Brief Meditation, Apropos of Nothing

After alluding to an episode in Beverly Cleary's _[Beezus and Ramona](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/038070918X/diesekoschmar-20)_ last night, I couldn't help but think about how much more clearly I remember novels I read as a child.  (For most of my time in Jerseyland, the Randolph Public Library consisted of seven shelves in a converted cottage no larger than a small bedroom.  But I don't think I remember those books the more for repetition.)  Ramona hiding in the basement chomping one bite from an apple before chunking the rest because "the first bite tastes best" pops into my head anytime someone mentions "the law of diminishing returns."  

I'm still inclined to think that "every iteration of an action can be as satisfying as the first so long as one reconstitutes the original context."  The "law" of diminishing returns can be circumvented because the strength of my commitment to the idea that it can be originated in my childhood.  Narratives encountered early function as the civil engineers of our mental lives.  They determine the depth and direction of the channels of all future thought.  They design the flood-controls and mourn their inevitable failure.  Such massive works we recognize with little enough effort.  But the scene from Ramona reminds me to sweat the small stuff too.  It's part of a carefully planned plexus of tributaries that screams contingency to conceal its design.  I will always consider vanquishable the law of diminishing returns.

But I'm _still_ not going to post another installment of "Fuck Act Theory" tonight lest I demonstrate my childhood and pet theory about it _in extremis_.
