## 271 notes (two hundred and seventy-one) from a novel I don't remember reading.*

Before I could return _[The Damnation of Theron Ware](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1605896969/diesekoschmar-20)_ to [my beloved](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/cashier.html) [library](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/unbelievable-up.html), I had to remove all the notes I'd stuck to its pages. It took me a while:

[![Note\_wheel](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168ff420c970c-320wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168ff420c970c-pi)

The resulting note wheel is as lovely as it is meaningless, because I remember absolutely nothing about _The Damnation of Theron Ware._ From my notes, I can _almost_ reconstruct why I read it:

Theron enjoys the "primitive" pleasures of Catholic picnics; contrast to earlier (235-6) image of it as orderly machine; no, from sociological & intellectual perspective it's orderly, from internal is 
primitive

If only I knew the antecedent of "it" I might be able to reconstruct my reason for reading the book. Am I the only one for whom [the Five Year Rule](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/a\_very\_unfunny\_.html) applies? (And do I _really_ want that question answered?)

(_x-posted_.)

Notation borrowed from a letter Joyce wrote to his mother after arriving in Paris: "Your order for 3s 4d of Tuesday last was very welcome as I had been without food for 42 hours (forty-two)." How's that for passive-aggression?

_Notation borrowed from_

Not to quibble (well ok, to quibble), would not the parallel notation be "271 notes (two-hundred and seventy-one)"?

[_Yes, it would.  Updated and corrected.  Thanks._]

It is kind of fun having a note -- one which seemed illuminating when you wrote it -- and no clear idea of what the source material is or how it sheds light on that material. Lots of room for extrapolation.

Nice color, maybe you can use it to hang on your door this Christmas.

So I guess you're not going to be giving a ringing endorsement of this novel then? The notes look pretty, at least.

I kind of like it. Arrange the notes in proper order and you may earn enough to pay your overdue student activities fees, or perhaps elicit an order from home, allowing you a snippy thank you.

_Nice color, maybe you can use it to hang on your door this Christmas._

I'm still Jewish, Ma.  (Nominally, at least.)

_It is kind of fun having a note -- one which seemed illuminating when you wrote it -- and no clear idea of what the source material is or how it sheds light on that material. Lots of room for extrapolation._

Sort of fun.  More frustrating.  When I re-read _Gravity's Rainbow_, I'm always flabbergasted by how stupid I was the last time I read it (as indicated by the "quality" of the marginalia).

_So I guess you're not going to be giving a ringing endorsement of this novel then?_ 

It's a late C19th realist novel.  You won't see me ring  many endorsements for any of those, period.  

_Arrange the notes in proper order and you may earn enough to pay your overdue student activities fees, or perhaps elicit an order from home, allowing you a snippy thank you._

Wait, poetry pays now?  Are times that hard?  Or do I just need to find myself a patron?

_When I re-read Gravity's Rainbow, I'm always flabbergasted by how stupid I was the last time I read it (as indicated by the "quality" of the marginalia)_

See, I've had similar experiences -- with that very novel and with others -- but the response I get to it is ideally not flabbergasm at my younger self's stupidity, but recollection of how I've enjoyed the process of coming to understand the book. (I'm kind of invested in this since I started keeping my "marginalia" online -- for instance my [10-year-old notes](http://readin.com/books/hamlet/) on reading _The Hamlet_ for the first time contain a whole lot that is obvious and silly; but also I can look at them and remember the flash of revelation I got in part III when I figured out what was going on with Isaac -- even if the details of the story have currently escaped me.)

Oddly, I can do that with some Faulkner too: I remember the first time I figured out what happened at the end of _Light in August_, as well as the first time I thought about the air in _Absalom, Absalom!_  But that's because I taught one and wrote a seminar paper on the latter.  Had I merely been reading them -- say, for pleasure -- they'd be long gone by now.  What's especially frustrating is how quickly encyclopedic knowledge of a text vanishes.  Right now, I can tell you what happens on most every page of _Watchmen_.  Two weeks from now, I'll be hunting and pecking again.  

But as to _Gravity's Rainbow_, there are two things to say: first, that novels as large and surprising as that one are impossible to acquire encyclopedic knowledge of -- that's why they're such a joy to re-read.  Second, I'm on my third copy of _Gravity's Rainbow_, so I can read my old marginalia from the summer after high school; the second semester of my freshman year; the summer after my sophomore year; the spring term my junior year; the entirety of my senior year, as it was the subject of [my senior thesis](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/the\_wayback\_mac.html) (and coincidentally, that post I linked to has itself been annotated, by me, a couple years after the fact); and the Winter Quarter of 2002, when I read it in Katherine Hayles's "Big Books" seminar.  All of which is only to say, your idea of keeping notes online is far, far cheaper than my decision to repurchase the same book again and again and again.

I've had a much worse experience with marginalia.  An ex returned my copy of Pale Fire with numerous scribblings in the margins.  The first time I read through them I would have this occasional twinge of panicky despair when I realized she'd picked up on things I'd completely missed.  Damned smart girls.  The only consolation is that I can gloat over how superior my penmanship is to hers.
