Few would dispute the claim that Michael Herr's [_Dispatches_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0679735259)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) stands somewhere near the summit of journalistic achievement.  You have your [Capote boosters](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=external-search%!F(MISSING)search-type=ss%!i(MISSING)ndex=blended%!k(MISSING)eyword=truman%!c(MISSING)apote)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1), your [Mitchell partisans](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=external-search%!F(MISSING)search-type=ss%!i(MISSING)ndex=blended%!k(MISSING)eyword=joseph%!m(MISSING)itchell)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) and your rabid [Joan Didion](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=external-search%!F(MISSING)search-type=ss%!i(MISSING)ndex=blended%!k(MISSING)eyword=joan%!d(MISSING)idion)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) fans . . . but even they would admit that while Herr lacks their beloved's body of work, _Dispatches_ alone earns Herr the right to be mentioned in the same breath.  Unless you ask Herr, who now insists that _Dispatches_ is a novel with all the trappings one expects from fiction in which the author writes "what he knows."  The vivid characters are composites, the dramatic moments were invented &c.  I'm tempted to dismiss his claims to having invented these characters as part of what had been (before the memoir craze of recent years) a structural bias against the literariness of literary journalists, the best of whom only _filter_ the brilliance of others.  Who wants to filter genius?  More to the point: Who can't?  _Anyone_ can filter.  Only geniuses are geniuses.  

Such seems the reasoning behind Herr's '80s argument and his subsequent struggle to have _Dispatches_ declared fiction.  I don't buy it.  My main objection is that it dehumanizes the grunts he lived with in Vietnam.  My secondary one is that it suggests that Vietnam couldn't do to kids what everyone knows it did.  Some of the more sensational scenes in _Dispatches_ do seem invented . . . but so do commonplace accounts of daily life during the Vietnam War.  In short: Herr wants credit for what historical context created.  I don't want to give it to him.  At least not for _Dispatches_.  But I'll give it up for [_Full Metal Jacket_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)B00005LC3Y)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1).  

"Wasn't _Full Metal Jacket_ was based on Gustav Hasford's [_The Short-Timers_](http://www.gustavhasford.com/short.htm)?"  

I admit: The first half of the fim was lifted verbatim from "[The Spirit of the Bayonet](http://www.gustavhasford.com/timers.htm)" section.  But the second half of the film contains numerous reworkings of material from _Dispatches_ and, more importantly, doesn't end with Cowboy's death like "[Grunts](http://www.gustavhasford.com/grunts.htm)" did.  The novel concludes with Joker killing Cowboy  after he's been mortally injured by a sniper.  Then they return to base.  In the film the Lusthog squad tracks down the sniper.  Rafterman shoots her down . . . but let me step back and let the ironies compound.

In the screenplay for the film Herr creates a composite of Hasford's "Joker" and Michael-Herr-working-journalist-in-Vietnam.  Hasford's Joker is a combat correspondent like Herr . . . only Joker went through BT and is actually a Marine.  Herr was a combat correspondent for _Esquire._ But when Herr adapted Hasford's novel he had Joker experience much of what Herr did and wrote about in _Dispatches_.  He grafted _Dispatches_ onto _The Short-Timers_.  Thus we see _Dispatches_' most memorable dialogue crop up in _Full Metal Jacket_.  To wit:
**DOORGUNNER:** Anyone who runs is a V.C. Anyone who stands still is a well-disciplined V.C. You guys oughtta do a story about me sometime. **** 

**JOKER:** Why should we do a story about you?

**DOORGUNNER:** 'Cause I'm so fucking good! That ain't no shit neither. I've done got me one hundred and fifty-seven dead gooks killed. And fifty water buffaloes, too. Them're all certified.

**JOKER:** Any women or children? **** 

**DOORGUNNER:** Sometimes. **** 

**JOKER:** How can you shoot women and children? **** 

**DOORGUNNER:** Easy. You just don't lead 'em so much. Ain't war hell?

That exchange is a "famous story" Herr reported in _Dispatches_.  A "famous story" transferred from the mouth of an anonymous doorgunner and anonymous reporter to an anonymous doorgunner and Private Joker.  And that's but one example of many such incorporations.  My general point here is that in _Full Metal Jacket_ we see Herr attempt to transform his journalism into fiction by "writing what he knows."  And "what he knows" is what went on in Vietnam . . . because he was there and reported on it in _Dispatches_.  I could elaborate on the paradox Herr would have us accept in order to claim the title "novelist" but instead I want to point to his crowning achievement in _Full Metal Jacket_.  Which brings me back to the film's final scene:  

The sniper corners Joker.  Joker's rifle jams.  His photographer sidekick Rafterman shoots the sniper then celebrates his first confirmed kill.  Only the sniper isn't dead.  She's alive . . . and just a kid.  The unit stands in a circle around and watches as she prays.  They argue about whether she deserves the mercy of a quick death.  Joker shoots her in the face.  

What interests me about this scene—which contra the above description is brilliant beyond words—isn't that it's not in _The Short-Timers_.  What interests me about it is that it is in _Dispatches._ Only the soldiers aren't soliders but journalists.  And the dead Vietnamese isn't a sniper or a woman but a body.  In _Dispatches_ Herr watches the reporters look at the dead body and _the photographers shoot pictures of it._ I don't want to belabor the analogy but it obviously meant something to Herr.  The photographers shoot the dead in _Dispatches_ but in _Full Metal Jacket_ the photographer fails to kill.  Rafterman can intervene but it's up to Joke-Herr to finish the kill.  (Terrible pun but one which neatly captures my point.)  I could continue with a full bore literary analysis of what Herr has done here . . . but I don't know how I would do so without psychologizing this decision.  I'm much more comfortable pointing to an obvious moment of creative struggle than I am outlining why it ended as it did.  I don't know why Herr did this _but I know that he did._

That scene in Dispatchers reminds me of so much of Stephen Crane's  _When A Man Falls_.  Except Herr, unlike Crane, acknowledges himself within the crowd of voyeurs.  In the acknowledgement of the deeper meaning in this moment and by feeling the force of it, he manages to remove himself slightly from the dehumanizing aspect of it.  Yet at the same time this deepens his responsibility and challenges his ability to act out of compassion.    

Maybe he had Joker mercy kill the sniper in the movie because Herr couldn't in Vietnam.  He felt powerless to effect change there, only fictionally (and perhaps this is why he reveres the medium so much more) was he able to control the outcome- rather than just observe and report it.

Jamie, I love that connection and wish I had thought of it myself.  Why I didn't . . . I don't know.  But it does seem like a rewriting of an inaugural moment in literary journalism.  Back to grading, then I'll respond to this more substantially.

Well, I love both Scott's analysis above--wish you said ALL of it in class--and I very much appreciate the connection Jamie makes to Crane vignette. Yeah, I wish I made that connection in class. Jamie, you will have to just interrupt us when you think of such good ideas. 

I, too, now return to reading midterm projects...

Scott, first time commenter, long time reader.  Thank you for posting this.  Full Metal Jacket is one of the few films during which I almost vommited.  But the experience of it was so compelling (I saw it on the July 4, 1987) that I went back and saw it with my Dad, who as a holocaust survivor had seen his fair share of war.  He thought it was a great film because of the constant sense of the unexpected, of moral ambiguity and betrayal.  And thank you for all the literary references: i had heard of The Short-Timers connection but not the others.

Alain, I'm always happy to see people delurk.  Way I figure, if you're here, why not mock and/or praise and/or shower me with expensive presents?  That said, I'm not sure it's clear in the post that some of what I linked to were chapters from _The Short-Timers_.  The only other book up there (besides Jamie's suggestion of the Crane) is _Dispatches_.  Sorry about the confusion. 

(Also, this is the first time I've ever had a Pulitzer Prize winner post on my blog.  Hooray for me!)
