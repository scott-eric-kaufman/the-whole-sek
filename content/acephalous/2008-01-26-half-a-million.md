Just noticed: [as of sometime recently](http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&s=sm4aceph), if I had a penny for every unique visitor, I would be 
$500
 **$5,000** richer.  I want to be 
$500
 **$5,000** richer.  Please insert pennies in the tip jar.\*  Be honest.  (Don't make me audit you.  You know I hate math.\*\*)

\*
Not actual tip jar.  Please refrain from chucking pennies at your monitor.

Because [math hates me](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/01/half-a-million.html#comment-98724116).

Dude, I see why you hate math. It must cost you a lot of money. 500,000 visitors / 100 pennies/dollar = $5,000.

Edited to reflect that the proof was in the pudding.

If they Paypal you only a penny, Paypal will take the whole thing as their fee.
