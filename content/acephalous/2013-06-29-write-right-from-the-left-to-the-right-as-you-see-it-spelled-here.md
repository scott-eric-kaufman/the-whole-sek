## “Write right from the left to the right as you see it spelled here.”

Given that I’m moving back to Louisiana, it only seems fair that I 
pass its literacy test before being granted the right to vote. 
Unfortunately, [it seems I’m illiterate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the\_vault/2013/06/28/voting\_rights\_and\_the\_supreme\_court\_the\_impossible\_literacy\_test\_louisiana.html):

1. Draw a line around the number or letter of this sentence.

How does one draw a line _around_ something? I thought lines were those infinitely extendable things with no curvature. How I am supposed to draw a _line_ around the number of this sentence? I have an idea!

[![linearound](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/linearound.jpg "linearound")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/linearound.jpg)

Wait — that’s three lines. Fuck. Maybe I should try to draw it around _the_ letter
 of this sentence? Not that I know what that’d be. Do they mean “the” 
letter of the question or “the” letter of “this sentence.” Given that 
both the question and “this sentence” have more than one letter, I’m not
 exactly sure what they’re asking me to do. Maybe this?

[![linearound2](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/linearound2.jpg "linearound2")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/linearound2.jpg)

Granted that’s _nine_ lines now, but they’re now “around” both “the” “letter” _and_ “the” number _and_ “the” word “number” in the question _as well as_ the words “this sentence.” I may not be right but I can hardly be wrong. Moving on:

22. Place a cross over the tenth letter in this line, a 
line under the first space in this sentence, and circle around the last 
the in the second line of this sentence.

 __ I got a little confused over whether they meant the first space in this sentence or “this sentence,” but I made up for it:

[![linearound3](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/linearound31.jpg "linearound3")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/linearound31.jpg)

They didn’t _ask_ me to draw Bad Ass Jesus struggling to get off the cross, but they didn’t _not_ ask me to either. I’m sure they’ll appreciate it. What’s next?

29. Write every other word in this first line and print 
every third word in same line, (original type smaller and first line 
ended at comma) but capitalize the fifth word that you write.

That’s it — I’m fucking illiterate. I don’t even know what the 
difference between “writing” and “printing” is. You win Louisiana! I 
won’t be casting any votes that matter anyway. Just _once_ I’d love to live in a state where they do.

As soon as I read the first question...

Damn -- I've been on a bit of an internet diet, and didn't realize earlier when you said you were moving to LA, you meant Louisiana and not Los Angeles. Maybe I'm illiterate too. 

As for #22, when they say "this line," do they mean that sentence (the last 's' in 'cross'), or the actual second line of the paragraph where it says "this line," which would be the 'h' in 'this'?

And has Bobby Jindal done this test?

No, not Los Angeles. I'm about as anti-Los Angeles as someone who's lived this close to it for more than a decade can be. Fucking hate the "city," which starts in north LA County and sprawls to an end somewhere south of San Diego. Give me defined boundaries and uncultivated greenery, please.

_As for #22, when they say "this line," do they mean that sentence (the last 's' in 'cross'), or the actual second line of the paragraph where it says "this line," which would be the 'h' in 'this'?_

It depends on if the applicant is white or black.

_And has Bobby Jindal done this test?_

Probably not in 10 minutes. It'd be entertaining to see him try.

Did you make it to the [big Kubrick exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art](http://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/stanley-kubrick) before skedaddling?
