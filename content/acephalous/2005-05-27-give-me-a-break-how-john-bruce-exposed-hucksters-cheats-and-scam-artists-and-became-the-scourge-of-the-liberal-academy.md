## Give Me a Break: How John Bruce Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Academy

A few weeks back, I mentioned having been [banned](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/you\_are\_banned.html) from commenting on a certain blog because I had confused its owner.  Then on [another blog](http://objector.typepad.com/objections/2005/05/mischievous\_pos.html) the banner accused me of stalking him.  I confessed, saying:
Busted! When you check your counter again--T-minus thirty seconds and
countin'--you'll see that since I've written this, I've reloaded your
blog another 17 (SEVENTEEN!) times. Ten minutes from now, I'll have
reloaded it another 37 (THIRTY-SEVEN!) times. Ten minutes from then,
and you'll have another 101 (ONE HUNDRED AND ONE! OH MY!) reloads. On a
Sunday morning (OH MY!). From my cell-phone. During services at [Higher Heights Full Gospel Baptist Church Ministies](http://www.usachurch.com/louisiana/houma/churches/church\_188105.htm).  While being threatened with _e_-ternal damnation for my _de_-plorable _de_-pravities, my _de_-pletory _de_-precations, and don't you forget, my sons, nor you, my daughters, my _de_-testable _de_-pedence on the fruits of my bounty of sin (OH MY!)...

"It's unfathomable," you think, "that anyone could believe that something other than the honest, heartfelt confession of a stalker."  You're an idiot...but not alone.  In response to the afore-linked [post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/you\_are\_banned.html) on my banishment, John Bruce graced my comments with some of his trademark "apt and memorable locution," writing:
Your little ["clique and claque"](http://www.cartalk.com/) routine might seem harmless to you, but I already got [Jonathan Goodwin](http://jgoodwin.net/)'s Bradley Foundation summer grant frozen.  Don't you remember what I wrote the [other day](http://mthollywood.blogspot.com/2005\_05\_01\_mthollywood\_archive.html#111582766131215092)?  Don't mock me because 1) I've got a "little man," 2) I don't "get" irony, or 3) I think _boulet_
is the coolest word ever. If you want to mock me, do it because 1) my
opinion of myself is so inflated I believe I could be responsible for
Jonathan Goodwin losing his summer grant, 2) because I attack people
for, among other things, "mix[ing] UK and US spelling" even though I
mix UK and US rules on the correct placement of commas and periods
relative to quotation marks--like I did in the very same post in which
I [criticized](http://mthollywood.blogspot.com/2005\_05\_01\_mthollywood\_archive.html#111608877535814701)
Miriam Jones for "mix[ing] UK and US spelling," something I'd think
ironic if I could identify irony when it isn't putting its boot to my
neck, demanding I scream its name (and even sometimes when it is)--or
3) because I can't stop talking about how many hits I get, you know,
because I spend hours watching that hit-counter click higher and
higher, even though it's probably more people popping on by to have a
laugh at my expense.

Damn!  His elocution _is_ apt to the motherfuckin' memorable extreme.  But today he dropped another apt and memorable elocutionary bomb.  Check this shit out:
Likewise, the frequent commenter on The Valve A. Cephalous had a
similar reaction a couple of weeks ago -- same thing, 20 or 30 visits a
day. Both the Linguistics prof and the Androgynous Cephalous would
leave multiple furious comments on many posts -- it goes back to my
suggestion that if someone's mad, maybe it's because someone else has a
point. The A.Cephalous got so weird, it started posting with other
people's names, and I had to ban it. Both A.Cephalous and the
Linguistics prof were spending far more time on my site than I was. _That_, it seems to me, is excessive and obsessive behavior.

Damn!  What can I say?  He's like "hahahaha n00b ur so liek 'im liek wftpwned and saddddddd liek cuz i no i sux'" and I'm like "lol d00d u r teh sux" and he's like "im lmao n00b cuz u cant c ur teh sux."  And he's right.  I shouldn't have deceived him by posting as "not the real X," nor should I have tried to be a one man denial-of-service attack, cuz shit d00d thats liek so uncouth, so vry, vry uncouth.  

In all seriousness, when someone's intellectual horizons are as limited as John Bruce's I'm almost tempted to start a charitable foundation.  People could donate canned goods, old clothes and irony...but then I remember that if I do that, he'll glue on his [John Stossel 'stache](http://web2.unt.edu/news/media/stossel.JPG), scream "GIVE ME A BREAK" and start demanding the canned goods, old clothes and irony I've collected on his behalf.

Interesting and possibly relevant in this regard is a new study in the Journal of Neuroscience, available at [http://www.newsday.com/news/health/ny-hssarc0524,1,5234771.story?ctrack=1&cset=true:](http://www.newsday.com/news/health/ny-hssarc0524,1,5234771.story?ctrack=1&cset=true:)

"The study tested 25 people with damage to the frontal lobe, 16 with damage in the region to the back of the brain and 17 normal volunteers. Rigged to scanning devices, the subjects were presented with a series of sarcastic comments.

For instance: Joe came to work and fell asleep. His boss walks by. "Don't work too hard, Joe," he says. Both normal volunteers and people with damage to the back of the brain understood that the boss was being sarcastic.

But Shamay-Tsoory said that people with damage to the right frontal lobe didn't get the irony of the comment, and, in fact, failed to understand that the boss was not happy with his lethargic employee."

Just a theory.
