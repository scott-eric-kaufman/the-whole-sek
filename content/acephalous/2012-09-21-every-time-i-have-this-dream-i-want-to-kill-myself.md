Translation: watching it made [my qualifying exams pass before my eyes](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/what-are-qualif.html), or [possibly trying to file](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/i-tried-to-file.html), or maybe just the entirety of grad school. It was horrifying.
