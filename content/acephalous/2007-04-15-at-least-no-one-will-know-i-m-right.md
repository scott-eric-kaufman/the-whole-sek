## At Least No One Will Know I'm Right

There must be a name for the urge that compels people to write things like [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/04/on\_the\_impossib.html).  (_Rekordbeheben_?)  Whatever it is, it ought to be modified to account for its blog-amplification.  (_Internettagebuchrekordbeheben_?)  We write these responses not with the expectation that they'll be read, but like the crank who believes [he'll one day be taken seriously](http://gentlemansc.blogspot.com/2007/03/i-love-me-some-kook.html).  The pathetic quality of these at-the-moon complaints is palpable, even in the moment of composition.  Yet so strong is our desire to undo the injustice visited upon us by idiots, we succumb.  

Every.

Single.

Time.

My money is on some combination of catharsis and blind faith in Google-aided vindication.  But I've been wrong before ...

No, Scott, you must have faith!  Faith in Jo.  Jo is the graduate student who may exist 200 years from now, 1000 years from now -- whenever you like.  Jo exists in a time when late 20th century records are the earliest known archived electronic mass discussions.  Jo is writing a dissertation.  (Or whatever they call them in this future time.)

And Jo is very interested in these squabbles -- just as you are in those of Silas whoever.  Jo sees every sparrow fall.  It's true that you may not be as influential or well-known as Silas whoever, but by Jo's time, all the well-known figures from this era have been studied.  Or maybe he's just chosen this as a case study or part of a survey or something.

At any rate, Jo will figure out, carefully, who was wrong and who was right, on the way to making whatever unknoweable larger point Jo was going to make.  None of the justifications, the explications of what you meant, are in vain.

Will Jo be able to read the emails, um, some guy/gal named "Greg"/"Gregorina" has sent asking me to take down the previous post, because of how poorly it reflects on him/her?  Because unless Jo can, I'm tempted just to start sending stuff now.  You wouldn't happen to know Jo's email? brainmail? mindmail? address now, would you?

Let's be reasonable, Scott; mindmail doesn't exist.  Rather, Jo will receive these missives like so: first, some Web archiver like the Wayback Machine will archive them.  (Some shadowy government organization is no doubt archiving all our Emails too, but those records are likely to be deleted when they become embarassing.)  Then somebody -- most likely to be some techno-libertarian "Long Now" person, though they may be an archivist who gets a government grant -- decides to put the Internet archive on really long term storage, gold disks or something similar.  Then civilization endures, at least to the point where gold disks survive and get loaded into Jo's future database.

So, Jo probably won't be able to read Emails.  I don't know -- you could take down that post, but that means that Jo would miss out on it.  Do you really want to do that to him/her/it/them?  Please balance "Greg/Gregorina's" needs against Jo's.  After all, I don't know whether "Greg/Gregorina" even sounds like a real person.

Scott, my sense as a completely distanced outsider and uninterested if not disinterested observer is that the diminishing returns problem is upon you and many at LS.  It hasn't gotten to the point the East Coast/West Coast rap thing got to (no longer inspiring creative attempts to outdo/diss each other but death threats and deaths), but, hey, it still could, given time and opportunity.  My probably unwanted advice is the same Amasa Delano didn't get when a sailor on the _San Dominick_ gave him a homemade version of the Gordian Knot and implored him to "cut it quick."  You all have more than got your lion cub claws sharpened by your years of "exchanges," so you're ready for the wild and don't need to continue practicing on each other any more.  You can save it for your journal articles and review essays like Zizek and Laclau (wtf happened between them, anyway?).

There are better ways to amuse/annoy yourself online.

Very constructive advice from the Constructivist there... 

You will notice that I have stopped participating in the LS / Valve fray. The reasons that you name are very important to this decision. Also essential is the fact that I broke bread with many of these guys at MLA 2006. Once you've broken bread with Holbo (and spiked his drink with a dropper-full of your own urine when he wasn't looking) suddenly you no longer feel the need to be so antagonistic on here.

The Constructivist, I always dislike those kinds of even-handed interventions.  Scott didn't go picking a fight; he wrote a perfectly reasonable piece on Foucault/Scull, for which he was flamed.  It's perfectly fine to tell Scott that it's not worth Scott's time or energy to respond, if you're the kind of person who advises others on how to spend their time or energy (I am).  But that's different than what you should be telling the person who repeatedly starts these things, if you're going to be bothering to tell anyone anything.

Also, it's not "many at LS".  It seems like one or two specific people at this point.  Let's not blame all of LS for one or two people (that goes for what Joseph wrote in the other thread, too, although he seemed more in jest.)

Scott,  

While I do love the faux German neologisms, I think faux a French one would be more appropriate, maybe some pun a la differance or something.  

cheers,  

Nate

Scott, my apologies for the advice--obviously it's your call and I should STFU and just stop reading the rare post I find boring and pointless from you.  

(BTW, Rich, I wasn't trying to be even-handed--it's obvious Scott's right and Craig's wrong.  Given how senseless Craig's been on this matter, I don't see why I should offer him any friendly advice, especially b/c I don't read him regularly, much less have a history of commenting.  Sorry for overgeneralizing the V/LS thing--and for not telegraphing my EC/WC rap joke better.)

No problem, Constructivist.  It's fine advice, just in this case, I couldn't take it.
