## The end of an era: no more cheap political rhetoric from me, no sir.

Midway through the 346 comments on [that thread](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/07/welcome-to-googles-postracial-america.html), I realized that whatever it was that was happening there, it has nothing to do with why I do this.  An email exchange with [Andrew](http://www.blographia-literaria.com/) sealed the deal: whatever academic blogging will become, it should not be so brazenly political.  The larger world can be engaged without directly engaging the larger world.  I want my spaces to be free not from dissent so much as formula: no one benefits from a common increase in the rigidity of all opinions.  

I will still venture into unfriendly wilds with abandon, but I will no longer invite the jungle in for drinks.  I can interact with everyone who participated on that thread individually, which goes to show that the internet may be less like a classroom and more like office hours.  Maybe I ought to start treating it as such.  What does this mean?  

1.  _[Acephalous](http://acephalous.typepad.com)_ will no longer tackle politics unless they directly relate to something in which I possess some expertise.  (Granted, that would not have stopped me from commenting on Gates, what with me having [focused issues of race and community](http://web.archive.org/web/20060830044703/www.ags.uci.edu/%!E(MISSING)skaufman/teaching/saved+as+html/english+28C+fall+2002+syllabus.htm) leading up to the dissertation, but the general principle is solid nonetheless.)
2.  My contributions to _[Edge of the American West](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/)_ will focus on the relationship of literary history to history history.  All jokes about trolling and trawling to the contrary, that is why they hired me in the first place.
3.  More from me on _[The Valve](http://thevalve.org/)_.  I'm its editor and it's my field and it's time to put these post-dissertation doubts to rest.  I need to do what I was trained to do instead of worrying about whether everyone will see that my degree was undeserved.
4.  I'll embrace my new gig, which is . . . roll some drums . . . at _[Feministe](http://www.feministe.us/)_.  A few weeks back I sent Jill an email in which I admitted to spending Monday mornings sifting through Sunday's shameless self-promotions and having to fight the urge to post a number of those links at one of my places so as to not to be tacky.  Starting this week, I'll be collating them over there.  (Not sure exactly how that'll work yet, but I'm working on it.)  I'll link to it from here, because I can't overstate how much those Mondays have changed me.  I'll delve into the how and the why over there come Monday.

I'm terrible at mission statements, but figure that if ever there's a time to make one, it's when your desk is pointed a different direction in a new city full of unfamiliar but not unpleasant smells.  

That time is now.

[_Thanks, happy_.]

That's ... that's a beautiful manifesto. I resolve not to sully your space. This is me resolving not to sully your space. You should see how I have my jaw set just so to where if you saw me you'd really sense a True Resolve.

Good luck at the Feministe place. What could go wrong?

oh. Your link for "that thread" is wack. Also the last sentence has that you're/your thing and it sort of dings the poetry.

...and by this time next year, you'll have spread to consume my _entire_ list of RSS subscriptions, I suppose?  Like some horrid alien fungus, I suppose, if horrid alien fungi were great writers.

Perhaps some of them are!

In all seriousness, however, I care much less _about what_ you write than _that_ you write.  (As long as it involves comic books reasonably frequently, of course.)  Here's to the new, apolitical SEK!

_I will still venture into unfriendly wilds with abandon, but I will no longer invite the jungle in for drinks._ 

It's your blog, Scott. I'm not convinced, though, that the jungle understands the distinction you're making, or will honor your boundaries. The analysis and commentary you were doing had value to your readers, though the resulting discussions may not have been up to your classroom standards. (I'm not being snide: you're clearly a great classroom teacher. But you're not grading us, so we have less pressure to conform or even try.)

Good luck!  Mission statements are tough since blogging works less on the mysterious logic of discovery and more on the outraged brain fart.

As Ahistoricality said, it's your blog, Scott.  The jungle won't understand _exactly_ where your boundaries are, but the mission statement's thrust is clear enough for most of the flora and fauna.  For starters.

_That thread_ can stand as the elephant (er, _another_ elephant).  Per the parable, each of us can be a wise man (or woman), interpreting it as we will.

_no one benefits from a common increase in the rigidity of all opinions._ Agreed, but most would benefit from an increase in adherence to my opinions. Haha. I admire your courage in treading as you have, but, as with nude bike riding, it's enough for me to know it exists. I don't have to watch, let alone participate. Therefore, I pledge that I will keep reading this delightful blog until I stop.

_Good luck at the Feministe place. What could go wrong?_

Only everything, but as it's a different everything, I thought I'd clean the slate here.  That said, your presence isn't sullying, nor am I asking you to leave . . . I just don't want to play host to you and Rich's politicking.  

_Here's to the new, apolitical SEK!_

I said "political," but what I really meant was, "not dominated by the news cycle."  Having circumstance force me out of the news cycle for a week made me realize how much it'd come to dominate my thoughts, and I didn't like that.  I'm still going to be covering material that's political, as per the Gates comment, but I'm not going to be covering it because everything on CNN must be addressed.  

Because, in all honesty, I found myself spending more and more time trying to find novel, intelligent approaches to topics everyone else was also writing about, and that's just not a productive use of my time.  (As I noted in the previous post, I have papers to revise, job folders to improve, and books to write.  If I spend all my spare mental space on what network suits deem important, I'm never going to get all that done.)

_As long as it involves comic books reasonably frequently, of course._

You'll be one of the few readers that I don't drive away in the next couple of months.

_I'm not convinced, though, that the jungle understands the distinction you're making, or will honor your boundaries._

Even if they don't understand the distinction, I'm absolutely positive they'll honor my boundaries.  There's happyfeet up there this very moment, actively honoring it.  

_The analysis and commentary you were doing had value to your readers, though the resulting discussions may not have been up to your classroom standards._

I appreciate that, Ahistoricality, and don't think you're being snide.  But it's not a matter of it being up to my classroom standards so much as it being so wholly different from my classroom that I don't know how to deal with it productively, nor, at the moment, do I have the time to figure out how to.

 _The jungle won't understand exactly where your boundaries are_

My reference to "the jungle" was rhetorically oblique: I'm thinking less of a place or the inhabitants of a place than what it takes on my part to interact with it and them.  So, no judgment on my part there, as in, I'm not calling everyone to my right "primitive," I'm simply saying that interacting with said folks can get "woolly," and needs to be done more carefully than I can do now if it's to be productive.

_That thread can stand as the elephant._

The one that we're all holding a different part of, or the one that's not in the room?  

_I pledge that I will keep reading this delightful blog until I stop._ 

And I pledge to be as delightful as possible for as long as possible, so you never have to.

_Mission statements are tough since blogging works less on the mysterious logic of discovery and more on the outraged brain fart._

Mine never were, though.  Actually, some were, but those are the ones I deleted.  I never write angry, because when I do, I stop being funny and can't be cutting.  So not posting about whatever everyone else is posting about will be a simple matter of stopping myself from sitting down, figuring out what everyone else is posting about, finding a novel entry-point into the conversation, &c.  For example, here's what I was going to post yesterday:

**It depresses me that this bit I wrote about the Birthers last week—but didn't post because it would soon be irrelevant—is still relevant.**

Members of the John Birth Society understand the importance of small details like [the placement of a comma](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/06/02/the-value-of-grammar/).  But because Birthers are born hypocrites whose courage lacks the conviction of a bad check, the paranoid scrutiny they apply to official state records never extends to the singular document they claim to defend . . .  Article 2, Section 1, Clause 5 of which clearly states that the last legitimate President of these United States was Zachary Taylor:

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States**, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution,** shall be eligible to the Office of President[.]

All praise those insidious commas and the clause they bracket.  Because Old Rough and Ready (1784-1850) was the last President born before the Constitution was adopted, every President since---and [one before](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John\_Tyler)---failed to meet the requirement of having been born a citizen (natural or otherwise) before 1787.

At which point I continued illiterately parsing that clause when I realized that I could be expending that same close-reading energy on something like, say, my book manuscript.

I've seen spiders and wasps talking politics too, but they were much more civil.

_I said "political," but what I really meant was, "not dominated by the news cycle."_

Yeah, I [did more or less the same step-back](http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com/2006/07/1001-ahistorical-posts.html) three years ago, with a six month return to regular political blogging for the election, but I've really felt much calmer about things when I don't have to have something to say. I don't troll the carnivals for material, abandon a few of the RSS feeds that were more for tracking topics than real information, and just post when I really feel like it.

_I've seen spiders and wasps talking politics too, but they were much more civil._ 

[this is what I do at my blog now:] [Robber Flys](http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com/2009/07/picture-bulky-darter.html) and [spiders](http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com/2007/10/pictures-spiders-and-bug.html) and [wasps](http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com/2009/06/picture-wasp-on-glass.html), oh my!

Well, I like the cut of your jib and would be likely to continue faithfully reading your blog even if you were to start writing obsessively about Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Especially if you started writing obsessively about Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in point of fact.  The first three seasons, though, before Cordelia left.

ohnoes. It's Monday and there are no delvings to be found at the feministe place. I looked and looked. Something has gone awry. It's just like in that one tv show where they had all these plans all put together but then the plans got messed up.

The news story selected just had clusterfark written all over it. At least Crowley helped Gates down the White House steps. 

But your book manuscript probably deserves more attention.
