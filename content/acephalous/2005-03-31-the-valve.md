Call it the Return of the Little Magazine.  An impressive list of contributors including Mark Bauerlein and Sean McCann.  From John Holbo's introduction:
_How many members of the MLA? 30,000? That a nation can support a
standing army of literary critics is a wondrous fact, and quite
explicable with reference to the volume of freshman papers, etc. that
must be marked. The number is inexplicable with reference to any
critical project. Yes, we need new scholarship (don't bother me with
more false dichotomies, please.) The point is: no one has a clear (or
even unclear) sense of what work in the humanities presently needs
approximately 30,000 hands to complete. I don't mean we should
therefore hang our heads in shame, although being a member of a
standing army of literary critics must be a semi-comic fate, at least
on occasion. But the utter lack of any justification for 30,000
literary critics assiduously beavering away explicating, interpreting,
erecting new frameworks, [interrogating the boundaries](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2005/02/it\_is\_the\_witti.html), etc., has consequences. Notably, when a book or article is up for publication and the hurdle is set, '
if_
it has real scholarly value', we discover this condition is just not as
intelligible as we would like, conditions being what they are. It isn't
true that literary scholars _value_ the output of 30,000 other literary scholars. They just don't, and that is quite sensible of them, really.

So stop reading what I've written.  Go to [The Valve](http://www.thevalve.org/).
