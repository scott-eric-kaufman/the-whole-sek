## Isn't it just a testament to the power of filmic cliché?

By "it," I mean this clip that's been [linked everywhere today](http://kottke.org/10/12/the-year-in-film-2010):





I don't mean to sound like a jaded film theorist, but the only reason this works is that so many films rely on the same basic cinematographic and emotional principles.  You could splice some David Lynch in there, but only if you decontextualized scenes he intended to be ironic.

Not, I should add, that it doesn't take talent to recognize and splice it all together...

Eh. I'm the worst possible person to comment on this, since I haven't seen anything in a theater since Frog/Princess, but it seemed like more of a stretch than other similar attempts at cliche-shaming I've seen. There are times when the cliches of clipping force cuts and inclusions that don't work, and the themes are so broad, and there's so many of them, that I'm not really sure they've found anything interesting.

I don't think there's anything that interesting here, either: it's just well-executed.  What I mean is, and I'm saying this over at LGM too, so I probably should've explained it better, but ... these are all films working with an explicitly American cinematographic vocabulary.  You couldn't shove Fellini or his heirs in there, for example, but you could Kurosawa, because so much of American action vocabulary's indebted to him.

Completely unrelatedly, have you read Tezuka's _Ayako_?  It's a fairly brilliant combination of American naturalist novel and typical Tezuka conspiracy-mongering.  I'm only half-way through at the moment, but so far, it's brilliant.

I see a lot of non-Hollywood movies in there, some that haven't even been released yet. It disgustingly makes 2010 seem like the kick-ass year of great releases that it wasn't. I don't think this remix works because every single one of those movies follow the same basic cinematographic and emotional principles but because the artist here searched for the most cliche element in each movie that would fit the bland Hollywood teaser trailer outline here. You could splice some decontexualized Lynch in there, but only the safest Lynch. No bizarreness from _Inland Empire_ would fit, for instance.

No. I got "Ode to Kirihito" relatively recently, which combines conspiracy, horror, literal bestiality, and deep Christianity. Not sure about naturalism, but it's an intense ride.

But this is the paradox of genre! I'm not sure how one could improve Bakhtin here--the language one uses must be recognizable, acceptable, socially valid, before any performative innovations could be discerned, or before they would even count as innovations.

Leelee Sobieski was in a movie this year?

Amid the murk of this "ultramodern" digital narrative, one tends to forget that the real skill in creating a film, novel, or poem is musical and requires presenting a series of pictures, scenes, and words with a recognizable, internal rhythm, a heartbeat if you like, that is related to, but separate from our own.  The beat here is synthesized or pre-canned.  The images also come prepackaged from film.  The splicing of film snippets is an extension of the music.  The visual reinforces the audio and vice versa.  

Koyaanisquati 1982 is a much better example of a similar form.  It is probably the model for this sort of thing. That film was creative in that it used an original score by Phillip Glass to support images of the deterioration of our planet.  It was original and informative, never boring.  This construction takes similar techniques and promotes the year's films for better or for worse.  I leave it to you whether you think this is worth doing.
