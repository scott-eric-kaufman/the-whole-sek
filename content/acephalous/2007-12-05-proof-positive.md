... that headlessness and academic despair go [hand-in-hand](http://peromniasaecula.blogspot.com/2007/12/coping-with-academic-rejection.html).

(Thanks to Dr. Nokes—who I rudely referred to by Christian name over there—for [the tip](http://unlocked-wordhoard.blogspot.com/2007/12/special-weird-medieval-treat.html).)

I don't mind if folks call me by my Christian name ... but in real life, I go by my middle name. I use my full name publically because I used to get e-mails intended for David Nokes (a Jane Austen scholar) and J. Richard Nokes (a guy who wrote Naval histories).

Nor do I raise a ruckus when people think my name Noakes, Snokes, or Nakes ... but I draw the line when Nakes occasionally morphs on my junk mail into "Naked."
