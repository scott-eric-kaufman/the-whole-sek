## Jews don't celebrate April Fool's ... what do you think the rest of the year's for?

It's come to my attention that the reason that I've been having difficulty sending and receiving attachments these past three quarters is that my students' Rhetoric-in-Practice projects are so large that I've exceded my allotted space requirements for my Gmail account. This has caused me no end of problems, for which I apologize. However, if you received a text, phone call, tweet, or email from me tonight apologizing for this indiscretion, know that it was sincere, and that I'll do my best to make amends, as best I can, in the coming months.

If you choose to believe otherwise–that my intent was malicious–all I can say is look at the life I've lived the past eight years, then stare into my eyes and declare that I've reason to have done this to myself.

Between this and the previous social media post I'm feeling (a) a tremendous amount of sympathy and (b) like this blog is getting harder to follow without a scorecard -- that is, you're referring to events in your life which have not been previously discussed on this blog, as if they should be familiar.

That isn't a complaint (really, it isn't), one of the nicest things about having a blog is the ability to write something and stick it up in a public place where it can be referred to later. But it does occasionally make for a slightly vertiginous reading experience.
