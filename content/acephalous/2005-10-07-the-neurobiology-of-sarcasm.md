## The Neurobiology of Sarcasm

Appropos of nothing, this evening I want to discuss an article from the May 2005 issue of the journal _Neuropsychology_.  Shamay-Tsoory, Tomer and Aharon-Peretz's "The Neuroanatomical Basis of Undestanding Sarcasm and Its Relationship to Social Cognition" posits that the ability to understand and produce sarcasm emerge the ventromedial (VM) regions of the frontal lobes.  To prove their thesis, the Israeli neuropsychologists lassoed "patients with well-defined, localized, acquired cortical legions" and subjected them to a battery of tests requiring them to identify sarcastic utterances.  These patients were presented with the following stories:
_Sarcastic Version Item_

Joe came to work, and instead of beginning to work, he sat down to rest.  His boss noticed his behavior and said, "Joe, don't work too hard!"

_Neurtral Version Item_

Joe came to work and immediately began to work.  His boss noticed his behavior and said, "Joe, don't work too hard!"

The patients were then asked a factual question ("Did Joe work too hard?") and an attitude question ("Did the manager believe Joe was working hard?").  If the subject answered the factual question correctly and the attitude question incorrectly, the research team would shake their heads, bite their pencils and note with great regret the subject's executive dysfunctions.  Then they did math:
Significant differences were found between the PFC, PC, and HC groups, χ
2
(2, 
N
 = 58) = 9.212, 
p
 &lt;.01; between the PFC and PC groups, χ
2
(1, 
N
 = 41) = 4.533, 
p
 &lt;.033; and between the PFC and HC groups, χ
2
(2, 
N
 = 42) = 7.135, 
p
 &lt;.008; but not between the PC and the HC groups, χ
2
(1, 
N
 = 33) = 0.313, 
ns
.

I don't know what that means, but because they knew I wouldn't be suitably impressed by one paragraph full of numbers and formulae, they decided they best provide another:
The differences between groups was reconfirmed by means of the Kruskal-Wallis 
H
, χ
2
(5, 
N
 = 58) = 15.481, 
p
 &lt;.008. Analysis of error frequencies using chi-square indicated significant differences between all groups, χ
2
(5, 
N
 = 58) = 13.709, 
p
 &lt;.018. In addition, the right prefrontal lesion group was significantly different from the HCs, χ
2
(1, 
N
 = 23) = 10.729, 
p
 &lt;.001; right posterior group, χ
2
(1, 
N
 = 13) = 3.899, 
p
 &lt;.048; and left posterior group, χ
2
(1, 
N
 = 15) = 7.824, 
p
 &lt;.005, but not from the bilateral frontal group, χ
2
(1, 
N
 = 19) = 2.328, 
ns
. The bilateral PFC patients were significantly different from the HCs, χ
2
(1, 
N
 = 30) = 4.455, 
p
 &lt;.053.

I know what _that_ means however.  It signifies they knew I knew the means and standard deviations were as follows: VM = 1.45 (
SD
 = 1.4); DL = 0.857 (
SD
 = 1.86); MIX = 1.42 (
SD
 = 1.9); PC = 0.19 (
SD
 = 0.4); and HCs = 0.11 (
SD
 = 0.33).  They only wanted to be sure that I knew that they knew that I knew that they knew.  Because they're thorough.  

After all the complicated math and arcane analysis of the one-tailed partial correlation between the sizes of the lesions and the impaired comprehension of sarcasm in patients, the Israeli researchers came to the conclusion that the common sequelae of orbitofrontal (VM) damage was not limited to social irresponsibility alone (as Bechara, Tranel, Damasio & Damasio, 1996 had concluded).  Perish the thought.  The other common sequelae of orbitofrontal damage consisted of the inability to locate contradistinctions between literal language and the social contexts in which it is deployed as a result of damage to the left hemisphere (which processes literal meaning), the frontal lobes of the right hemisphere (which processes intentional, emotional and social contexutalization of utterances) or the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex, all of which work in concert to bind the literal to the contextual meaning to produce an accurate assessment of sarcastic utterances.

Am I intimating that some people may have suffered damage to their ventromedial prefrontal cortex while playing with their model trains?  Of course not.  Brain lesions sometimes form absent any identifiable blunt trauma.  But one can easily imagine the inability to differentiate a sarcastic utterance from an hysterical "[tantrum](http://mthollywood.blogspot.com/2005/10/two-questions-for-scott-eric-scott.html)" as evidence of damage to the ventromedial cortex.  Proof of this fact will come in the form of a response to this entry which characterizes its author as having composed it in a state of homicidal rage.
