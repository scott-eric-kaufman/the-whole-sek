## <em>The Decoration of Hou—</em>

There _must_ be a better online version of Wharton's [_The Decoration of Houses_](http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/DLDecArts.DecHouseWhar) than the one I just linked to.  I have a difficult time dealing with interfaces seemingly designed to frustrate both the subject doing the interfacing and the object being interfaced.  I can barely read it, and half the time I turn a page, the next one never loads.  It seems both Scott and the Server are unhappy.  

I'm _this_ close to moving on entirely, despite the fact that the discussions of "conditions" and "conditioning" in the book seem perfectly geared to my topic.  Does the book not know I only have nine days to finish this chapter?  Does it not realize that I'm only futzing with it because the copy I interlibrary-loaned four weeks ago still hasn't arrived?  Does it not care?
