## Sometimes Even the Paranoid ...

_Scott opens his car door, adjusts the seat and sits down.  He puts the key in the ignition and Ramona (the car) wheezes to life.  He hears the generic jazz of a NPR segue fading out._
**Announcer:** We're here talking to Scott Kaufman ...

**Scott:** (_looks around_)  Who we are? 

**Announcer:** ... about the most important issue affecting student-athletes today ...

**Scott:** (_seriously freaked_)  Who we are what?

**Announcer:** ... the legacy of Title IX on the thirty-fifth anniversary of its passing.  Thanks for talking to us, Mr. Kaufman ...

**Scott:** (_clearly delusional_) ****You're welcome?

**Announcer:** So how has Title IX changed the way colleges recruit your students ...

**Scott:** (_clinically lost_) ****I don't have students.

**Other Scott:** Our ability to place female student-athletes in top programs ...

(_Note: Scott Kaufman_—that _Scott Kaufman_—_is the athletic director at Princeton High School.  But Scott Kaufman_—this _Scott Kaufman_—_thought the episode too weird for words._)

I had an NPR moment like that once!  Sort of.  I turned on the car and the radio was quiet for a second, and then one of the Morning Edition announcers said "Welcome back, Susan!" and for half a second I thought I was going insane.  (Turned out that Susan Stanberg was filling in for someone and they were just being nice to her, but the timing was eerie.)

"Scott Kaufman—-that Scott Kaufman—-is the athletic director at Princeton High School."

And yet the two of you are never seen together in the same room at the same time ... hmmm ...

Susan, another one of those moments:

The year's 1994, and I'm a huge fan of Pavement's _Slanted and Enchanted_.  So I'm standing at the record store the day _Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain_ is released.  I buy it, pop in it my CD player, and hear some guitars tuning.  _Then_ "Alright, ready Scott?"  

FUCK YEAH I AM WAIT WHAT?  

It's obviously Malkmus talking to [Scott "Spiral Stairs" Kannberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott\_Kannberg), but I was blessedly confused for a moment there.

Mikhail, don't worry, once the USSR Russia rises to world prominence again, all the little children in Iowa will be named Mikhail (by government mandate, because in Soviet United States, you don't name children, &c.).

Adam, I'd be able to afford patches for the pajamas I blog in if I were the athletic director of anything ... and damn it, my pajamas need patching!

I've never had an NPR moment, but a Miriam Burstein was out stalking Rush Limbaugh a few years ago.  This was vaguely worrisome, especially when Free Republic linked to my blog (me: "No! No! _Not_ the same person!").  

There's also a Miriam E. Burstein with an MA in English from Columbia University, c. 1940s.

There's a very famous right-wing historian and TV pundit over this side of the Atlantic called Professor Andrew Roberts.  Does a lot of stuff on the BBC.  I once (as, very occasionally, I do) did a brief thing for BBC Radio 5, on the then-latest Harry Potter novel, for an agreed fee of something like £80(plus as much Green Room carton orange juice as it pleased me to drink).  BBC accounts then got me confused with the other Roberts and sent me a cheque not for £80 but for a very hefty sum of money indeed, presumably for all the TV work he had been doing.  I sent it back, of course, but with a curiously heavy heart.  Still, it amused me to think of the eminent other Professor getting his cheque and going 'eighty quid? For all the TV stuff I've done for them?  Grrr!' and shaking his fist at the envelope.  Possibly.

You need to tell bob ciotta about this so he can go and meet Scott Kaufman when he is home in Princton.  He would get a kick out of it. I wonder what that Scott looks like. It is safe to say he will not look like an American-Indain-Irish-Jewish man!!
