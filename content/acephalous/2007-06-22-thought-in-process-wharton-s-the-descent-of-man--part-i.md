Indicative of my current juvenile acuity: while reading a discussion
of male homosexuality in Victorian culture I laughed aloud when I encountered the
name of the person whose work had been cited: Dr. [Harry Cocks](http://www.bbk.ac.uk/hca/staff/harrycocks). 
I initially thought it a prank of some sort, but as you can see from
the link, that's the man's name.  His work seems high quality, but
when I read his name, I snorted like a seventh grader.  (For which I apologize.)  Needless to
say, I'm _not_ in an intellectual place today.  So, I'm borrowing a page from my friend Wally's [book](http://waxbanks.typepad.com/blog/2006/11/sunday\_warning\_.html) and begin this post by saying:

No idea where this is going.

Edith Wharton's "[The Descent of Man](http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=WhaDesc.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=1&division=div1)" (from the collection of the same name) compels us to consider it in light of the _other_ book entitled [_The Descent of Man_](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2300),
written by Charles Darwin.  It won't surprise you to learn that there's
no shortage of irony in the title.  Parsing that irony is no mean task,
but such is my aim.  (The page numbers refer to those found on the page
linked above.  Haven't checked whether they actually match those in _Scribner's_.)

The story opens with Professor Linyard returning from a holiday on
which he has "eloped with an idea" (313).  Eloping is a most grievous
sins in a society in which matches are made with an eye toward
improvement.  It suggests something illicit has occurred, and Wharton's
language backs this up:
As the express train whirled him away from the somewhat inelastic
circle of Mrs. Linyard's affections, his idea seemed to be sitting
opposite him, and their eyes met every moment or two in a glance of
joyous complicity; yet when a friend of the family presently joined him
and began to talk about college matters, the idea slipped out of sight
in a flash, and the Professor would have had no difficulty in proving
that he was alone. (313)

The
playfulness aside, metaphorical eloping stirs similar feelings of
impropriety in Dr. Linyard as actual, otherwise he wouldn't air his
anxious little fantasy—not even or, perhaps, especially to himself. 
The time he vacationed alone (but for his idea) he describes in
explicitly romantic language:
There, during the long cool August days, lying full length on the
pine-needles and gazing up into the sky, he would meet the eyes of his
companion bending over him like a nearer heaven. (313)

Does the story's title reflect upon the intersection of Darwin's theories of sexual selection (discussed at length in _The Descent of Man_)
and the society in which such romantic narratives play out?  Linyard,
after all, is discussing the desirability of his idea as a companion. 
His interest in his own domestic affairs is similarly informed by the
evolutionarily-influenced sociological theory:
He took as it were a sociological view of his case, and modestly
regarded himself as a brick in that foundation on which the state is
supposed to rest. Perhaps if Mrs. Linyard had cared about entomology,
or had taken sides in the war over the transmission of acquired
characteristics, he might have had a less impersonal notion of
marriage; but he was unconscious of any deficiency in their relation,
and if consulted would probably have declared that he didn't want any
woman bothering with his beetles. His real life had always lain in the
universe of thought, in that enchanted region which, to those who have
lingered there, comes to have so much more color and substance than
the painted curtain hanging before it. (313)

If
only Mrs. Linyard were more interested in his ideas—if only marital
congress could happen in his "universe of thought" in which ideas about
sexual desire replace the desires themselves—then he would feel guilty
about cheating on her with them.  Had she only "taken sides in the war
over the transmission of acquired characteristics," he would be in a
position to feel humanizing guilt.  The irony will become apparent when
the nature of the idea is (shortly) revealed.  

This idea will differ from those which had previously paid the
bills.  But the synthetic nature of those works is revealing.  Just as
Darwin tried to cross the bridge between intellection and evolution in
humans, Linyard invests his time writing of "The Ethical Reactions of
the [Infusoria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusoria)"
and "The Unconscious Cerebration of the Amoeba."  Both fictional
monographs place human-defining rationality not merely in lower
species, but in the lowest, as amoeba are unicellular.  Linyard's work
is an exaggeration of actual attempts to place humanity in the
evolutionary taxonomy by demonstrating that the traits which had
historically set him above it can be found within it.  

More shortly, since if anyone even wants to read it, the odds of them reading it straight through run from slim to none.
