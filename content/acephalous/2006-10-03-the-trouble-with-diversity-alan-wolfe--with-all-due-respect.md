Today in Slate, Alan Wolfe writes [a classic “with all due respect” review](http://www.slate.com/id/2150826) of [_The Trouble With Diversity_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/080507841X/diesekoschmar-20):

Michaels pictures himself as the tough guy willing to take on the hard
issues of class while everyone else opts for warm and fuzzy bromides
promising cultural and racial diversity. Indeed, he argues, so
prevalent is this superficial desire to bring everyone together that
Americans apply ideas of tolerance and acceptance to areas where they
do not belong, especially the area of religion. “Only someone who
doesn’t believe in any religion can take the view that all religions
may plausibly be considered equal and that their differences can be
appreciated,” Michaels writes.  (I am one of the people he has in mind
here.) Like his colleague Stanley Fish, he insists that “if you believe
that Jesus is the way and I don’t believe Jesus is the way, one of us
must be wrong.” Believers, including nonbelievers, have no choice but
to fight it out. Convincing each other is futile; converting each other
is our only option.

With all due respect, Michaels has no idea what he is talking about.

Wolfe continues:

He writes about religion without distinguishing between
religions. Hence, you would never know that some religions do indeed
look for converts, while others actually place barriers in front of
those who would join. Nor do all religions assign the same priority to
belief as evangelical Christians do; observance, for some, is more
important than belief, and so long as a society allows them to keep
their strict observance, they can easily live together with others of
different convictions. And even those who believe that Jesus is the way
have come to accept that others can find God in other ways. Since
Nostra Aetate (1965), the Vatican has worked assiduously to recognize
the validity of Judaism to Jews, and the great bulk of American
evangelicals, for all their talk of witnessing the faith, do not
routinely tell their Hindu co-workers that they will burn in hell. In a
world in which intermarriage is a fact of life and switching
congregations hardly worthy of notice, religious diversity is an
inescapable fact, not a logical impossibility.

With all due respect, I think Wolfe misses Michaels’ point here.  It’s not that believers _should_
“fight it out,” but that their beliefs should have a normative force
which flies in the face of religious diversity.  As he writes:

The point about the Ten Commandments, as Neuhaus reminds
us, is that they are commandments: “They are not, as has been said, Ten
Suggestions or Ten Significant Moral Insights, to be more or less
appreciated according to one’s subjective disposition.” What it means
to be a believer in the Ten Commandments is to believe that it is in
fact wrong to do the things they enjoin against, and that anybody who
does not believe in the Ten Commandments is mistaken, and that anyone
who does not follow them is behaving wrongly. (186)

As Michaels demonstrates, once these _beliefs_ have been subsumed by _identity_,
confusion follows.  Beliefs anchored in incompatible worldviews
shouldn’t partake of a live-and-let-live philosophy; when they do, you
end with nonsensical notions like “people are _prejudiced_ against fundamentalist Christians.”  No, they aren’t.  Some people _disagree_ with fundamentalist Christians, but that’s a _disagreement_; it is _not_, as some fundamentalists would have it, an irrational _prejudice_ like racism.  When treated as such, it leads to the idea that some _beliefs_
ought to be respected simply because people hold them.  If you want to
see ID taught in high school biology classes and I don’t, you can claim
I’m _prejudiced_ against you, when in fact I merely _disagree_.  Confuse this fact too often, and you’ll have school boards in Kansas debating teaching Creationism again…

...wait, _what?_
