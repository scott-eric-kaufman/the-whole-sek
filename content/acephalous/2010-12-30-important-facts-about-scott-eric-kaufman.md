(_If you ventured here from that odious place, you may want [to read this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/12/the-donalde-rings-in-the-new-year.html) before you leave a comment I'll delete._)

Because I have someone—likely a former student using a pseudonym or a random troll—by the name of "Eric Oden" signing me for mailing lists (Military.com and American Intercontinental University Online in the past hour) and creating an alternative email address that looks like mine and then doing generally untoward things (like making false promises to people on Craigslist).   To that end, I thought I'd at least put this information out there for anyone who searches for my name:

My email address is scotterickaufman (@) gmail (.) com.  If someone claiming to be me contacts you from any other address—no matter how similar it is to that one—it is not me and you can either ignore it or forward it to my actual email address so I can keep it for my records.

[This link](http://www.facebook.com/scotterickaufman) takes you to my Facebook account.  (Feel free to friend me if you so desire.)  Should someone claiming to be me contact you from any other account—no matter how similar it is to that one—it is not me and you can either ignore it or forward it to my actual email address so I can keep it for my records.

[This link](http://twitter.com/#!/scottekaufman) takes you to the Twitter account I only ever use to alert readers to new blog posts.  Should someone claiming to be me contact you from any other account—no matter how similar it is to that one—it is not me and you can either ignore it or forward it to my actual email address so I can keep it for my records.

Sorry to write such a boring post, but because I just received an irate email about never showing up in Pomona to inspect a truck that "I" had expressed a strong interest in purchasing, I'm thinking prudence is my best option here.

I totally know an Eric Oden, I will immediately start sending him harassing messages on Facebook.

Wow, what an amazingly douchey thing for someone to do to you.

I'm cheering the "douchey" dude who obviously thinks SEK's an asshole. 

Happy New Year to that!

More of Donald Douglas and his situational ethics... No objective standards for right and wrong... His cheering bad behavior over the internet (as long as it's not happening to him, of course) is pretty nihilistic... which should surprise just about nobody who knows him. Cheering the perps and screwing the victims (as long as he disagrees with them politically, of course)... The morals of Dr Douglas in a nutshell...

You're a creepy dude, Douglas...

Capitalism requires information and trust in order to function.  Professor Douglas encourages market sabotage: manipulating a instruments and institutions of the market (and misdirecting consumers). 

Diabolically clever.  Brilliant ploy.  

Is he some sort of _sub rosa_ Red?
