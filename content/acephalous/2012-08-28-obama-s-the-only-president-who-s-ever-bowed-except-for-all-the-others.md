## Obama’s the only President who’s ever bowed, except for all the others.

A Republican PAC full of former Navy Seals, Special Operations for America, [will be releasing an ad entitled “Bow to Nobody” at the RNC](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2012/08/27/Exclusive-Next-SEAL-Ad-Excoriates-Obama-for-Bowing-to-Foreign-Leaders):

Ryan Zinke, the former Navy SEAL who started the super 
PAC, spoke  exclusively with Breitbart News today. “The ad itself 
accurately  portrays where this President is,” said Zinke. “It 
accurately portrays  his core belief that America should not lead. This 
president is shaping  America to be one of the followers, to relinquish 
our role as a world  leader. I didn’t fight 23 years as a Navy SEAL to 
watch America bow to  anybody.”

He continued, “It’s not just the king of Saudi Arabia. My friends  
from WWII that fought in the Pacific theater—when they see the  
president bow to the emperor of Japan, I’ve seen veterans cry[.]”

When asked whether it was inappropriate for former SEALs to speak 
out,  as some on the left have alleged, Zinke answered, “If the veterans
 can’t  speak out, who can? I think it’s a duty of every veteran and 
every  citizen to be actively involved in our political process, 
especially  when the president sets out to negotiate away our rights 
under the  Constitution. There have been other veterans—TR, **Eisenhower**, JFK—they’ve been active in speaking out and shaping the policy and politics  of our country[.]”

For reasons that will become abundantly clear, that emphasis is mine.
 Zinke’s logic is that he shouldn’t fight to protect American freedom if
 the President is going to go bowing around the world willy-nilly. 
Moreover, he feels entitled to take this stand because other former 
military men, including the man who was once the Supreme Commander of 
the Allied Forces in Europe, Dwight D. Eisenhower, remained “active in 
speaking out and shaping the policy of our country[.]” Implicit in 
Zinke’s claim is that someone like President Eisenhower would never 
diminish the office of the Presidency by bowing to foreign leaders. One 
problem: conservatives already floated this notion that [the](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/11/14/obamateurism-of-the-day-156/) [President](http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2009/11/024948.php) [never](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15516) [ever](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/bowing-before-monarchs-and-tyrants.html) [bows](http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009/11/obamas\_botched\_bow.html) so I already know a little something about President Eisenhower: _the man could not stop bowing_. Hi there, Pope John XXIII!

By Zinke’s logic, I believe that last bow means _we have all been French since 2 September 1959_.
 Eisenhower clearly demonstrated by that bow that the American President
 is a subordinate of the French, which means that for the past 50 years 
America has been a French territory with pretensions of sovereignty. _Mon Dieu_!
