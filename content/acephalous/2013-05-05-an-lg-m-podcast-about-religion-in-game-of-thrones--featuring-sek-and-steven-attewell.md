How  do y'all feel about pool parties? Not attending them, mind you, but  hearing other people having them in the background of a podcast you're  listening to? Because I think they should make you feel _better_ about yourself, because here you are, listening to an intelligent podcast that makes your brain smarter, whereas the people at the pool party are just drinking and laughing in the Southern California sun. They'll come home drunk, sun-burned and utterly ignorant about what the Talmud has to say about those who collect shit-tons of _mitzvot_. Enjoy!
