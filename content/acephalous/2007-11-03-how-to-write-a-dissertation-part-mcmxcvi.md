**Option #1:**
Spend weeks skimming seventeen volumes of [Mark Twain's letters](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520237722/diesekoschmar-20) for references to Darwin, Lamarck, evolution or social development.  Collect all relevant references into a single file.  Collate according to potential usefulness.  Accidentally delete one or twenty of them.  Copy them again.  Feel confusion.  Know that you had that one reference.  Remember that it was right there.  _Right there_.  

Skim letters again for the phrase "unfortunate development."  Picture where you were and what it was like when you wrote it down.  Think: "It was overcast that day ... which was when I looked at Volume IV!"  Skim Volume IV.  

Fail.  

Cry.  

Leave library.  

Drink.

**Option #2:**
Put off starting Twain chapter for a month.  Feel pure bliss when the [Mark Twain Project](http://www.marktwainproject.org/) launched this week.  Search Mark Twain's letters for "Darwin," "Lamarck," "evolution" and "social development."  Save relevant letters to "My Citations."  Feel "Happiness!"

Drink.

**Option J:**
[Not an option](http://digamma.net/btfwiki/index.php/Option\_J).

Scott, when you were first putting together your thesis proposal, did you ever think that evolution in nineteenth century thought might be a bit large a subject to tackle with the hope of ever actually finishing your thesis?  I mean, I am agog and in awe at your attempt to tackle such a project, but it just seems a bit... humongous for a dissertation.

Andrew, 

I didn't, but then again, no one ever does.  What I mean is, I thought I'd isolated a local problem, and further sequestered it by limiting its provenance to 1895-1910 ... but that didn't work out.  However, your comment has struck a nerve, and is something I need to think more about.  Expect a post shortly.
