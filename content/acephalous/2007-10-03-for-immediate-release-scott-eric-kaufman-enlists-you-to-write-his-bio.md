## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Scott Eric Kaufman Enlists You to Write His Bio

 * Originally posted at http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/for-immediate-r.html

**IRVINE** — Scott Eric Kaufman has been asked by the scholar chairing his [panel](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/07/american-litera.html) on Saturday to write a brief introduction for himself.  However, Kaufman hates writing short biographies, because every word he writes about himself seems to consist of 49 percent _braggadocio,_ 49 percent false humility and 2 percent error.  He believes the readers of his blog, _Acephalous_, could write him a biography which contains no _braggadocio_, actual humility and even more hilarious error.  

All are welcome to apply.  If none of his readers take him up on his offer, he has pledged to embarrass them permanently when they least suspect it.  Earlier victims rave about the quality embarrassment he provides: 

"I didn't—I _couldn't_—leave the house for months," raved one visibly shaken woman.

"How am I ever going to look my wife in the eye again?" raved a trampled man.

"I thought I'd recovered," raved an old-souled young man.  "But then I saw the fabric softener, and it all came rushing back."

"The nightmares—they never said, never told me," raved a drooling senex.  "I still see the looks on their, in my dreams—when I sleep, when I close my—I see their faces, and I—their faces, then I ..."

I believe "braggadocio" is an English word, not requiring italics.

This is one of those cases in which it's impossible to tell.  I mean, it _looks_ so Italian.

Or wait, Vance, was that your suggestion for my bio?  Because that'd be awesome:

Our other panelist is Scott Eric Kaufman, from the University of California, Irvine.  I believe "braggadocio" is an English word, not requiring italics.

We have a winner!

"For the first time in my life -- and the life of an immortal is very long -- I knew what it was to feel shame," said Priapus, a local man who, due to state budgetary cutbacks, was forced to share a gym locker with Kaufman in the third grade.  "You can forget how long a semester really is," he added, before beating his giant penis against he ground, setting off several nearby car alarms.

Why are you making \_us\_ do it when you could just use [this](http://watchout4snakes.com/creativitytools/RandomParagraph/RandomParagraph.aspx) again?

See:

Scott eric kaufman pretends behind biography. How will biography orientate scott eric kaufman? A resting conductor tones biography past a crystal. The justified synthesis rejects scott eric kaufman on top of the style. The literate phoenix suspects. Biography refunds scott eric kaufman with the rolled socialist.

Heh.  Well, I was going to suggest that you do whatever I do when I'm asked for a mini-biography for some kind of local poetry thing.  I write or say "My name is Rich, and I write poems."  But that would require that we figure out what you actually _do_.  

Which is really kind of difficult.  You can't say "My name is Scott, and I write dissertations."  Because there is only one, and someday, strange as that may be to think of, you may finish writing it.

OK, two things: First, noone likes threats.  OK, some people like them, but we don't have that sort of relationship here (maybe someday, but not yet).

Second, the fabric softener thing could've worked if I hadn't still been distracted by the clunky construction of the "old souled young man."

BUT, because I like you, AND because you've made my last couple writing semsesters significantly less painful through the power of prolific posting and schaden freude, I offer the following:

"SEK is a terminal graduate student in English at the University of California, Irvine.  His dissertation examines the representation of evolutionary thought in early twentieth century American literature, with particular attention to the way that non-Darwinian theories of evolution animated both narrative and conceptual literary representations.

"He also publishes the often self-indulgent and occasionally hillarious academic blog, 'Acephalous,' which alternates between research notes, considerations of the ennui of graduate student life, musings on baseball and other aspects of popular culture, short humorous essays, and intentional provocations involving commentary on various blog-fights (which SEK may or may not have been previously involved in), attempts to attract both earnest partisans and internet crazies to comment on his site and/or harass him in his virtual life, and subsequent efforts to elevate the entire affair into some sort of performance art or virtual happening."

Perhaps, with the promise of enough drinks afterwards, you can convince the chair to finish the introduction with, "Ladies and gentlemen, I give you..."

He's just this guy, see.

Wait, that's about a guy with 2 heads, so let's edit.

He's just this guy, see, which goes to show that two heads aren't always better than none.

I believe "braggadocio" is a long word, which may or may not require italics. 

Is the biography meant to be read or heard? Does the intended audience understand English? Am I too late? Still, with these unanswered and important questions rattling around in my brain, I press on (in English):

Scott Eric Kaufman is the product of millions of years of evolution. So are you, I suspect. He no longer oozes from point "A" to point "B," unless drunk or flu-stricken, and he can breath air (a necessarily precise mixture of nitrogen, oxygen and some other gases, maybe something blue). These evolutionary gains have treated Scott kindly, allowing him the ability to think, read and write. All things being equal, though, he'd rather have had a second head. END COMMUNICATION.      

This is my thanks for allowing me to post on your blog subject to only a minimal amount of harm. Ciao!
