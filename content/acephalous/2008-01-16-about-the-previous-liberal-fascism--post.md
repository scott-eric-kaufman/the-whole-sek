## About the Previous <em>Liberal Fascism</em> "Post" ...

 * Originally posted at http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/01/about-the-previ.html

Wasn't meant to be one.  Was what professional bloggers call a "draft."  Now that I think about it, that _is_ what "professional" bloggers call a "post": blustery quotations, predictable sarcasm and no original thought.  I'm no professional blogger.  But [Jonah Goldberg](http://liberalfascism.nationalreview.com/) is!  

You no doubt wonder why I [continue](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/i-recognize-i-c.html) to bother with this intellectual fraud.  Has something to do with finishing the dissertation, with all the crossing of _t_'s and dotting of _i_'s I've performed these past few months.  Bothers me someone could write something so crassly opportunistic and demand it be taken seriously.  Bothers me more some people [will oblige](http://pajamasmedia.com/xpress/michaelledeen/2008/01/14/fascism\_liberal\_and\_otherwise.php).

Goldberg bathes in the adulation of those who know no better.  Attend to the plaudits of the proud anti-intellectual!  Witness the alexipharmic email he [published this evening](http://liberalfascism.nationalreview.com/post/?q=M2ZmNGY2NDYzNmFmYTQzZjE3ZDZmYjQyY2YzNWE5NmI=)!
You're a guy looking at two fish saying, "They're the same thing:
fish." [[Michael Ledeen](http://pajamasmedia.com/xpress/michaelledeen/)]'s the specialist in ichthyology saying, "Nice try, but
please.  But this is a carp and the other is a haddock.  The differences
may be enumerated thusly ... "

That carp are freshwater fish and haddock saltwater matters not!  

"Both are fish," Goldberg opines, "and should be treated as such.  All that is required to raise either is a saltwater tank and some fish food.  What do you mean, have I raised them myself?  _They're both fish.  All they need is fish-food and saltwater._ Are you some kind of expert or something?" 

When informed that his interlocutor _is_ an expert, instead of demurring, Goldberg takes comfort in the ignorance of his readers.  _They_ know carp and haddock are both fish.  _They_ know all carp and haddock (being fish) need is fish-food and saltwater.  

"What," they demand, "could an ichthyologist possibly add to the conversation?"

To which the ichthyologist rejoins, "Fewer dead fish.  Better smelling tank.  Cleaner filters.  Edible food."  

Only expertise renders his opinion suspect.  Experts distinguish when they should simplify.  Imagine the headlines in Goldberg's ideal republic:
"Anti-Anti-Fascists Lose Teeth," _New York Times_, 16 February 2008

A new and grotesque method of asserting their authority [has] been adopted by the Anti-Fascisti at [The Corner](http://corner.nationalreview.com/).

Entering apartments, they force residents to utter the national
cry, "All Fish Are Fish, Are Fish, Are Fish!"  Those who refuse to obey have some of their
sound teeth pulled out.

Would that my dissertation could "rise" to Adam Bellow's "high" standards ...

I love watching someone of moderately above-average intelligence, who has chosen a career path so as to prove to the world he is superduper intelligent (!), get all worked up when a down-to-earth, laid-back, TV-watching, conservative pundit (who's never even thought of reading Proust!!) manages to make a lot more money, gain a lot more fans, and somehow in the process, come up with some impressive lines of argument. Don't worry. You're not the only one. It's pretty much the whole of the lefty academic blogosphere. In any case, keep it up! I'm having a blast!

Dude, who said I was of moderately above-average intelligence?  You haven't been reading this blog long, have you?  (I mean, not that I don't fit your stereotype, what with me not being laid-back, never watching TV or reading funny books, and spending all my time reading Proust, but still, you're right, I don't make much in the way of money.)

P.S.  Tell Werner "Howdy!"  (And make sure to include the exclamation point.  It's important.)

See, to me what's important is to know which Herzog is commenting: _Ulysses_-Herzog, or Saulbellow-Herzog.

In my land, my dear fellow, we have a pub-fight mantra.  It goes: _leave it!  He's not **wurf** it!_.

I was wondering why Herzog [young Bellow's handle?] thought that Goldberg was of moderately above average intelligence. What a careless reader I am! He never said such a thing at all.

In the lot more money,lot more fans category, Goldberg still has a long way to go to catch up with our girl Britney, who's also ten times as laid-back, down-to-earth, and TV watching. Can't argue with success!

Britney's heterosexual, and unlike Goldberg, fertile too. Get on it, Jonah!

I know this is blogwhoring, but I wonder why Goldberg is giving friendly interviews to [antisemites.](http://jjcohen.blogspot.com/2008/01/kerfuffle-wading-on-liberal-fascisms.html)

What's awesome, Herzog, is that you display the same diligence in making an argument that Jonah does: namely, none. You care to respond to any of the points made here--for example, Jonah's laziness about Herbert Spenser--or any number of the posts [here](http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/) by someone--and I know expertise makes you people gag--who's, wait for it, an EXPERT in fascism?

Didn't Herzog forget to mention Goldberg's mother?  I mean, you can't really suggest that Goldberg's success is the fruit of his down-to-earth, laid-back, TV-watching, conservatism when it was his mother who provided him the earth for downing, the back for laying, and the TV for watching, can you?  I mean, Jonah didn't become the fat, smarmy moron he is today on his own merit or anything.  Without Lucianne, Jonah would be nothing.

I realize Herzog is likely just doing a hit and run here, but perhaps you'd care to defend [your boy](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2005/08/jonah-goldberg-smarter-than-jessica.html) here. He's a real peach.

Goldberg is a ninny, but Scott, is he really saying something more offensive than WB Michaels, who basically makes the same argument in \*Our America\* (that is, the argument that the Progressives were a pack of racists)?

Oh no, LB.  The problem with blog discussions is that initial context controls development to a high degree.  If you start with Goldberg, you can't then branch to a reasonable discussion about WBM, even if a reasonable discussion about WBM was clearly possible with the same group of people.  In this case the context operates through the "basically makes the same argument" phrase, which will alternately make people deride WBM for the manifest ridiculousness of Goldberg and make people defend WBM against any connection with the manifest ridiculousness of Goldberg.  But nothing in WBM is really about Goldberg.

Rich, I think it's OK as long as we limit the discussion to the _differences_ between Goldberg and WBM -- or at least their arguments -- therefore preserving the context.

Racist does not equal fascist. They'd have to be racist, violent and nationalistic, at least, and I don't remember that being the case (not an Americanist). Therefore WBM's argument can stand, but Goldberg's doesn't really advance.

Yeah, I've made this point [elsewhere](http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=471#comment-4718), but if all Goldberg were doing was pointing out that progressivism produced its share of horror shows then no reasonable person, leftist or otherwise, would argue with him in any context.  What he seems to doing instead is using eugenics as a launching pad for arguing that bussing and affirmative action are the modern version of the creation and liquidation of the Łódź ghetto.  Among other things this is an interesting version of the contemporary conservative rallying cry, "Let's refight the 70s!"

Hey, I have a Ph.D. in philosophy from a top 5 US university--I say this not so you'll bow to my wisdom, but so you'll know I'm just like you!--and I think that the line (not said in this post, but all across the blogosphere in various places), "REAL SCHOLARS DO THEIR OWN RESEARCH!" is something of a double standard. I wrote my dissertation on Kant, and other ethicists have come to me asking what Kant means with so-and-so, explain Kant's derivation of the categorical imperative to me, etc. I never thought they weren't real scholars. So for Goldberg to ask people about Herbert Spencer--well, I don't think that's crazy. Academics do it all the time, so why can't Goldberg? I haven't read his book, though; does he have a whole chapter about Herbert Spencer? 

Incidentally, sek, I wrote a dissertation that was rather revisionary about one part of Kant's corpus; in fact, I think everybody but me is wrong about this part of Kant's thought. Yet I can see how, if someone asked me about it, and I told him what I thought, and he said, "no one else has said it like this" and I said "well, that's because everyone else is wrong" ... well, I can see why he'd be suspicious.

I think that the problem was that Goldberg didn't seem to  be willing to read anything by Spencer at all, or even very much about him. It seems to me that he could have skimmed through a few library books in an afternoon and have found a source saying what he wanted. I do that kind of thing all the time on topics of peripheral interest.

In your case, Bobcat, I'd guess that people were looking for a sharp guy up to date with the literature, not trying to save 3 or 4 hours of work.

There's tons of stuff about the various relationships between Fascists, syndicalists, anarchists, communists, left-wing-social democrats, and progressive reformers. Some of it is eye-opening, especially vis-a-vis racism. But Goldberg's books is a hack job customized for use in contemporary political debates, and he defines fascism so broadly that practically everyone in the twentieth century was a fascist except the most doctrinaire Hayekians and Miseans.

Hi John,

Thanks for the response. Sometimes they wanted me to save 3-4 hours of work, but only where the reference to Kant wasn't really necessary for their point -- it was really because they knew Kant had street cred with philosophers and wanted to see whether they could include him as for or against their project.

Bobcat,  

There is no polite way to to refuse, but I tend to think that you should not help these people.  This is partly because in this case they're missing the entire intellectual point (to my mind the point of reading Kant is the exercize of reading Kant), but also because, at a certain point, you're essentially abetting someone else's intellectual dishonesty.

SEK -

I have posted a review of this sorry excuse for a book at Amazon, and hope you don't mind that I appropriated your description for my title.  Attributed, of course.

[http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IZJNOKCSQ31T/ref=cm\_cr\_pr\_cmt?%!F(MISSING)encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0385511841#wasThisHelpful](http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IZJNOKCSQ31T/ref=cm\_cr\_pr\_cmt?%!F(MISSING)encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0385511841#wasThisHelpful)

I notice some twit responded that you go by your middle name and somehow that is evidence of something. Or maybe it's Spencer who goes by his middle name?  Or ... huh?

Hope you get around to posting a review.  It should be dynamite.
