It's [the first day of class](http://www.avclub.com/articles/framing-can-turn-you-from-a-witness-to-the-murdere,102221/), and I'm starting really basic. As in _really basic_. That's where the best courses begin.

Attendance and participation are both mandatory. I want to see 
comments from familiar faces in these new strange places. Because if it 
weren't for you, I wouldn't have this new gig. Engaging with you lot 
made me want to investigate this mode of writing, so you owe me. __ 

_You owe me._

Now go make me look good in front of my new bosses. What? _Really_?

Fineâ€”I also want to say _thank you_ for all the encouragement over the years. I wouldn't have this opportunity if it weren't for you.
