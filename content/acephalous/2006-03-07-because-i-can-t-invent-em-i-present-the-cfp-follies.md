Exhibit A:
**Call for Papers: Revenge Fiction. Proposed Special Session for MLA '06** (_Philadelphia, 12/27-12/30/06_).

What is the place of revenge in the history of the novel?  What formal opportunities and challenges does it present?  What cultural work do revenge narratives do? 500-word abstracts by March 15.  E-mail submissions to _Daniel Hack_ (preferably not as attachments).

The latter emphasis is both mine and awesome.  One day I'll send out a CFP asking for papers dealing with either Scotland or German mercantilism . . .
