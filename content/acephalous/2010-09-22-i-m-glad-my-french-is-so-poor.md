Were it better, I might be tempted to read [gorgeous, adult-themed French comics](http://www.humano.com/) in the original instead of the hilariously poor translations available online.  For example, I would've missed [this](http://www.humano.com/album/35519):

[![Clockwerx translated](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f4777188970b-500wi "Clockwerx translated")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f4777188970b-popup)   
This tub!  It is cursed and jiggles!  Other examples abound, obviously, but none quite capture the tone-deafness of crowd-sourced translations quite as well as this one.

Just sounds like slang to me, not that it isnt funny.
