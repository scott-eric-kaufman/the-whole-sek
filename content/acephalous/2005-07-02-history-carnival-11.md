Another three weeks, another mention of Y.T. in the newest [History Carnival](http://branemrys.blogspot.com/2005/06/history-carnival-xi.html).  Before I know it this attention'll head to my head and swell it all out of proportion.  (Full disclosure: it already has.)  But I'm not only included in the current History Carnival, nay, never, I'm _spotlighted_ in the "Host's Discussion Pick."  [Siris](http://branemrys.blogspot.com/), said host, says "So I'm very interested in the form these questions take elsewhere, and would like to see more discussion of it," which I believe means he wants more people to discuss me.  Because I'm living a Very Special Life, one worthy of discussion.  And study.  And remuneration.  _Serious_ remuneration.  So alright already!  Start discussing and studying my many virtues!
