I just learned Octavia Butler died on Friday.  

I'm in shock.  

Not faux-shock, mind you, but shock-shock.  She's my first favorite author to die on me.  I've never thought about what that means before . . . but it's sinking in.  

I don't like it.

It's extraordinary and horrible: the former because it came so completely out of the blue, the latter because (quite apart from everything else) she was so obviously right in the middle of a golden period when she died ... her most recent books really are some of her best.

I keep having to pinch myself.

I met her once, when she was shortlisted for the 2001 Arthur C Clarke award and flew over to London for the ceremony.  Such a lovely person; such a great writer.  I don't use 'great' lightly, either.

It's a great shame. Maybe we should listen to [Blöödhag's](http://www.bloodhag.com/index.html) song about her as a strange memorial?

Same here.  I'm completely shocked and saddened by this news.
