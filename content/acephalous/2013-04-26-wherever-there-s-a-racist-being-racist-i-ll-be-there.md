## Wherever there's a racist being racist, I'll be there.

As someone who writes about race and also teaches at the University of California, Irvine, I take full responsibility for [this egregious recording](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-uc-irvine-blackface-video-20130426,0,1660301.story). Clearly, I'm a horrible teacher because students I never taught wore blackface on the Internet.

So say the emails that poured in after a prominent conservative 
blogger tweeted my email address in connection with this local scandal. 
But as I scanned subject lines while deleting said emails, I noticed 
that I'm not the only one to blame. Irvine also has an [African American Studies program](http://www.humanities.uci.edu/afam/) that failed to prevent this racist display from happening. And a department of [Asian American studies](http://www.humanities.uci.edu/aas/) that neglected to inform an Asian American student that racism is bad. The [Women's Studies department](http://www.hnet.uci.edu/womensstudies/) also did nothing to prevent this performance of antebellum proportions from occurring on its campus (because abortion).

Point being, despite all these programs and departments dedicated to 
creating a more compassionate body politic, there are still students on 
the Irvine campus who are racist. Therefore, per these emails and the 
dictates of logic, the aforementioned departments should be shut down. 
They're disappointing the corporate charter. The only real solution to 
fighting racism is to stop fighting it.

Then it'll just go away.

**UPDATE:** I forgot to mention [how humorless these "studies" people are](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/update\_africana.html), and how their humorlessness is responsible for everything wrong with America.

I've never ceased to be amazed at the two-conflicting-ideas-simultaneously trick: There is still racism so attempts to alleviate racism must be stopped; minority/womens studies programs are dangerously divisive and trivially ineffective; criticizing us publicly for the obvious implications of our ideas is dangerous and demeaning, but publishing the addresses of progressives for private harassment is just the natural effect of free speech in the marketplace of ideas. 

I know, because I'm human, that I have elements of hypocrisy in my words and actions, but if it ever gets that absurd, I hope somebody will strike me sharply with a large flat object.

_I've never ceased to be amazed at the two-conflicting-ideas-simultaneously trick_

It makes perfect sense, because of logic. Do you not understand logic? Of course you don't, you're a liberal. I bet you study Asian stuff!

While the tactical deployment of illogic is indeed a theme in certain Asian civilizations (e.g. the Zen koan, Laozi's "governing a state is like cooking a small fish", et c., ad naus.), it is specifically a \*refutation\* of logic, a parodic paradox if you will. 

In other words, these people are dumb no matter what perspective you take....

Racism will continue until racism is the 50' burning cross in the living room. There for all to see, but never mentioned. To reach this goal, we must enable racists and racism whenever possible.

QED.
