## Gays are like ninjas that way.

[Beyerstein](http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise\_/2009/05/thune-no-gay-justice-.html) and [Benen](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009\_05/018065.php) rightly point out that Jeff Session’s [magnanimous decision](http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/sessions-would-consider-gay-nominee-2009-05-06.html)
not to automatically disqualify a gay nominee is an intellectually
dishonest ruse designed to preserve the intellectual dishonesty of his
fellow Republicans.  “We could imagine seating a gay judge, but their
position on gay issues would align them with the far left and we think
a moderate justice would better serve the needs of the American
people.”  Not that they’d ever say that—but of course they would.  I
yield the floor to the [gentlemen](http://chambliss.senate.gov/)
from Georgia: “It’s something I’d have to think through with respect to
whatever issues might be forthcoming that the court may have to
consider.”  More interesting than the predictable hypocrisy of bigots
are the reponses from Session’s compatriots:

“It’s not been part of the calculus for me,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

“I have never, frankly, thought about that situation,” said Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.), the GOP standard-bearer in the 2008 presidential
election.

“I’ve never thought about it,” said Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.).

Why did it never cross their minds that a gay person might aspire to
a position on the highest court of the land?  Most would say it has
something to do with them being incapable of sympathizing with a good
chunk of their constituency.  They wouldn’t be wrong.  But I like to
think this befuddlement a sign that the rainbow cloaks and resplendent
daggers of the great homosexual conspiracy learned how to hide in plain
sight.  Instead of months of comminuted innuendo that amount to the
fear that someone might someday marry his dog, conservatives will
stroll blithely down the corridors of power completely unaware that a
certain piece of legislation might be good for the gays _until it’s too late to do anything about it._

Thanks for the link. I hope Obama does pick a gay nominee because it will split the GOP wide open. Knuckle-dragging homophobia will doom the GOP and the smarter Republicans know it. So, the Murkowski/McCain faction is walking a fine line--either they can break with their colleagues in an attempt to preserve the long term viability of the Republican brand, or they can stand by and risk being (correctly) perceived as apologists for bigotry.

Broken link to "http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/chambliss.senate.gov/" -- is this supposed to be to chambliss.senate.gov or what?

SEK: If you can see my email address, I'd appreciate a message, I have a different topic I would like to discuss in private.
