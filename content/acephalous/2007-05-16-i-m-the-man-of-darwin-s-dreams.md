On 21 September 1838, Darwin transcribes the following into his "M" notebook:
Was witty in a dream in a confused manner.  Thought that a person was hung & came to life, & then made many jokes about not having run away & having faced death, like a hero, & then I had some confused idea of showing [the] scar behind (instead of front) (having changed hanging into his head cut off) as kind of wit showing he had honourable wounds.  All this was kind of wit.  I changed I believe from hanging to head cut off.  There was the feeling of banter and joking because the whole train of Dr. Monro['s] experiment about hanging came before me showing [the] impossibility of person recovering from hanging on account of blood, but all these ideas came one after other, without ever comparing them.  I neither doubted them or believed them.  Believing consists in the comparison of ideas, connected with judgment.

I like that I make an appearance in the "M" notebook, as it's the one in which Darwin tracks the moral and social consequences of the transmutation theory he's concurrently working out in the "D" notebook.  In terms of world-historical import, I suppose the fact that he knew natural selection would have far-reaching implications is of paramount importance ... but what I most appreciate (outside my appearance as a heroic wit) is that Darwin believed the content of his dreams__significant enough to record alongside his thoughts on Malthus' _Essay on the Principle of Population_, Comte's _Positive Philosophy_, and Hume's _Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding_.  

This proves that were he alive today, Darwin would have a LiveJournal ... in which _he would write about me_.  I can sleep easy tonight.
