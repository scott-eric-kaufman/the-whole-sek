## Untitled Thomas Pynchon

This information shot across my radar a few weeks back, but I didn’t
believe it until today.\*  You can now pre-order your very own [Untitled Thomas Pynchon (Hardback)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159420120X/diesekoschmar-20/).   

I’m not sure what to make of Amazon’s description (or its purported source):

Spanning the period between the Chicago World’s Fair of
1893 and the years just after World War I, this novel moves from the
labor troubles in Colorado to turn-of-the-century New York, to London
and Gottingen, Venice and Vienna, the Balkans, Central Asia, Siberia at
the time of the mysterious Tunguska Event, Mexico during the
Revolution, postwar Paris, silent-era Hollywood, and one or two places
not strictly speaking on the map at all.

With a worldwide disaster looming just a few years ahead, it is a
time of unrestrained corporate greed, false religiosity, moronic
fecklessness, and evil intent in high places. No reference to the
present day is intended or should be inferred.

The sizable cast of characters includes anarchists, balloonists,
gamblers, corporate tycoons, drug enthusiasts, innocents and decadents,
mathematicians, mad scientists, shamans, psychics, and stage magicians,
spies, detectives, adventuresses, and hired guns. There are cameo
appearances by Nikola Tesla, Bela Lugosi, and Groucho Marx.

As an era of certainty comes crashing down around their ears and an
unpredictable future commences, these folks are mostly just trying to
pursue their lives. Sometimes they manage to catch up; sometimes it’s
their lives that pursue them.

Meanwhile, the author is up to his usual business. Characters stop
what they’re doing to sing what are for the most part stupid songs.
Strange sexual practices take place. Obscure languages are spoken, not
always idiomatically. Contrary-to-the-fact occurrences occur. If it is
not the world, it is what the world might be with a minor adjustment or
two. According to some, this is one of the main purposes of fiction.

Let the reader decide, let the reader beware. Good luck.

\*I was burned by _Time_ in 1997.  Some fool wrote a feature about the publication of [_Mason & Dixon_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312423209/diesekoschmar-20), [_The Gospel According to the Son_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345434080/diesekoschmar-20), and the “forthcoming” Salinger novel.

I've never understood this -- why would anyone pre-order something like a forthcoming Pynchon novel?  Because they think that it'll never appear in bookstores and they won't get to read it otherwise?  Because they think they'll get it early?  It seems inherently scamariffic.

For one, because Amazon ships books a few days before they hit the shelves, and since some people subscribe to Amazon Prime, that means they receive pre-ordered books three, sometimes four days before they hit the shelves.  (And with the same mark-down in price that Barnes & Noble slaps on new flat-backs.)  Plus, I want to be the first one done.  Given the date of its release and my December commitments, that may not be possible ... which is why I fully intend to use some of my new publishing contacts to see if I can't land me a review galley.
