Turns out [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/gender\_citation.html) was my 1,000
th
 post, and some comment or another was my 15,000
th
 comment.  

I'd keep track, but I can't, what with it involving math.  So congratulations to me!  I've as many posts and comments in my three years o' blogging as [Unfogged](http://www.unfogged.com/) has in a week.  

I am become important, indeed.

(_None of today's posts were supposed to be posted today.  I blame TypePad, but I'm sure it's my own exhaustion/incompetence which is responsible.  I'll reply to comments tomorrow, as I'm plum tuckered tonight._)

"I'm plum tuckered"

I'd have spelled that with a b, plumb. My wild guess at etymology would trace it to plumb (meaning straight or true, as of a wall or post) from the latin plumbum, the elmemnt lead, as in plumb bob. Thus, plumb tuckered would be truly tuckered. But that's all speculation. maybe it means purply tired.
