## Leonard Cohen's "How to Speak Poetry," How He Spoke Poetry, and How Poetry Shouldn't Be Spoken

In the comments to Ogged's [post](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week\_2007\_07\_29.html#007277) on Ezra Pound, DS [links](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/comments\_7277.html#602539) to something I once spent years looking for: Leonard Cohen's prose-poem "[How to Speak Poetry](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/leonard-cohen-how-to-spea.html)."  Of course, Google returns thirty copies of it, mocking my then-futile search to acquire a copy of the collection it's from, [_Death of a Lady's Man_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670261475/diesekoschmar-20) (1979).  (Not to be confused with his 1978 collaboration with Phil Spector, _Death of a Ladies'  Man_.  I love the humility of the book's singular.)  All of the copies online (until now) contain the same typos and odd paragraph breaks, which nicely parallels the copy I found in 1995: hand-written, riddled with misspellings, and slightly altered to apply to one local poet in particular.  So I clean it up the copy I found on Google with some reservation.  You can read the whole thing at the link above, but for my current purposes, a few excerpts will suffice:
The word butterfly is
merely data. It is not an opportunity for you to hover, soar, befriend
flowers, symbolize beauty and frailty, or in any way impersonate a
butterfly. Do not act out words. Never act out words. Never try to
leave the floor when you talk about flying. Never close your eyes and
jerk your head to one side when you
talk about death. Do not fix your burning eyes on me when you speak
about love.

Sound advice, since most poets are poets, not actors—only, some poets _are_ actors.  For the second time in three days, I'll link to "[Innisfree](http://students.depaul.edu/~tstukel/atd12.htm)."  Does Cohen want to deprive the world of Yeats' oracular chanting?
Speak the words with the exact precision with which you would check out
a laundry list. Do not become emotional about the lace blouse. Do not
get a hard-on when you say panties. Do not get all shivery just because of the towel. The sheets should not
provoke a dreamy expression about the eyes. There is no need to weep
into the handkerchief. The socks are not there to remind you of strange
and distant voyages. It is just your laundry. It is just your clothes.
Don't peep through them. Just wear them.

No.  Cohen can brook the _performance_ of poetry, he simply has no patience for poets whose performance consists of a pale representation of their poems:  "The word butterfly is not a real butterfly."  Cohen rails against the obviousness of reference, against the poet who shoots his audience a seductive look when he speaks of seduction, who mistakes the words for what they represent.  

His dictum against the obviousness of reference extends to the obviousness of response: "Do not get a hard-on when you say panties."  Inspiring the audience to erection is the point, otherwise the performance degrades into expression—another uninteresting whinge about which no one beside the poet cares. 

Anyone who listens to Cohen must choose which Cohen performs "How to Speak Poetry" in his or her head.  Will it be the thin, flat voice of the '60s and '70s or the gruff majesty of the '80s and '90s?  Time for visual aids.  Do you hear this one:




Or this one, chosen _not_ because it's a striptease, but because it's a striptease from [_Exotica_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305428107/diesekoschmar-20) and I never miss an opportunity to [praise](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/10/the\_trouble\_wit\_1.html) Atom Egoyan:




Does it make a difference so long as it is read without affect?  Can it even be read with affect?  I ask because so much spoken poetry reminds me of [this](http://todgoldberg.typepad.com/tod\_goldberg/2007/07/the-dulcet-tone.html):

Some people read poetry, which I think we can all agree, is a form of torture we should really be employing on enemy combatants. Remember when we were trying to get Noriega out of his compound and we blasted heavy metal as an enticement for him to give up—and let me tell you, you want me out of my compound, all you need to do is get some White Lion on the loudspeaker and my shit will be making time for the exit like it was my job—and yet inside he stayed? I'm telling you, get some black clad-clove-smoking-Tori Amos fan out there reading his free verse in poet voice and we could solve the Gaza Strip issue in five lines:

    

_And the WORDS were like a RASH upon my FECES

      

AND the feces were like a burning BUSH and Bush was like my FECES

      

Upon the alter of OIL and THE MAN and the Man was like A RASH

      
And I am a TOOL of LIFE and LIFE is a TOOL that smells of my fetid waste

      

WASTE. WASTE. I am a waste. A BURNING BUSH. The hypodermic push of my ..._ Oh, sorry, looks like the Palestinians and the Israelis have figured it all out. I'm off to the hooka lounge.

Cohen certainly never sounded so craven, despite gazing more deeply into his navel than most of his contemporaries.  "How to Speak Poetry" is far too measured to bear the treatment of Tod Goldberg's hypothetical emoter.  Were this a different sort of blog, and were bandwidth permitting, I would love nothing more than for people to submit slammed versions of Cohen's prose-poem.  Who could pass up the opportunity to hear the tale of the fucking flower-befriending butterfly, hovering the fuck hither, the fuck thither, so fucking fragile, so fucking symbolic, like a bush, a burning bush, a fucking burning Bush, burning in the effigy, in the effigy of sympathy, for the fucking efficacy, of the inefficacy, of the inefficiency, of the bush, the burning Bush ...  

I take it back.  That would be horrific.  Even in parody, some things bruise the soul.

Since '71, I have kept with me the Caedmon disc (TC 1326, For Stereo or Monaural Phonographs) of T.S.Eliot reading The Waste Land (complete) b/w nine other of his Greatest Hits. And from time to time, I have tormented family and friends with the thing. Of course, if I'm feeling truly sadistic, there's always Caedmon TC 1155 at hand: Ezra Pound reading a few Cantos ...

_With usura, with usura hath no man a house of cut stone ..._ 

And a wider dissemination of Cohen's advice would be helpful. That and outlawing Poetry Slams.

Leonard Cohen reminds me of Bob Dylan, in the sense that every version of his songs by other people is superior to his own versions (with a few exceptions in Dylan's case, but I've not seen any exceptions yet in Cohens).

And if you want to parody Cohen, you'll have to get in line. The Austin Lounge Lizards' [LEONARD COHEN'S DAY JOB](http://www.leonardcohenfiles.com/lizards.html) is pretty devastating (and sung in the later style).

Marc, I've heard the Eliot, but if I remember correctly, he's reading it in the '40s, which would be like hearing Cohen sing "Suzanne" now.  Torture, indeed.

Ahistoricality, you won't find me parodying Cohen, although the man himself does now.  "The Future" is a far cry from anything off _New Skin for the Old Ceremony_.  The same goes for the Dylan comparison: better to hear Jeff Buckley sing "Hallelujah" than Cohen at this point, but I don't think anyone other than Cohen can make "The Stranger Song" dance.  And now that I think about it, most of what makes the covers of his mid- and late-period material superior is the lack of 1) synthesizers and 2) annoying female backing vocals.  Strip Cohen's "Everybody Knows" down and it's every bit as good as Concrete Blonde's cover.  

Adam, the sound of poetry slamming is comparable to the sound the body of an investment banker working on the fiftieth floor makes upon impact.  Disgustingly squishy yet crunchy, like God cracking the knuckles of His Soapy Hands.

After breathing into a brown paper bag for several minutes, I still cannot process that remark. I am reduced to muttering, "Damned kids today ... "

[Although Buckley's version of "Hallelujah" is fine, I prefer Rufus Wainwright's cover. ]

He sings flat and he sings loud and he sounds like he's having fun: that's great in a jam session, and it's enough for other people to figure out a singable melody, but it's never going to be more than a rough first draft of music to me. Why does someone hyperventilate [every time I make that point](http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com/2005/08/thursday-lyrics-dont-think-twice-its.html) about Dylan? Never mind, don't answer that. Dylan is one of those cultural figures about whom I formed my own opinion and whose "artistry" is simply beyond my simple comprehension.

I will, of course, horor your simple request. But, if I may, perhaps you'd allow me to share a little story with you. 

One night, working at a club in New York, Louis Armstrong had just climbed down off the stand after a particularly brilliant set when a fashionably-dressed woman came up to him in the bar and said, "You were just brilliant tonight, Mr. Armstrong, but I was wondering if you could tell me, what is jazz?"

Dabbing at his damp forehead with a monogrammed handkerchief, Satchmo just smiled and said, "Lady, if you have to ask, you'll never know."

Cohen, like Dylan, is an acquired taste.  The fact that there are some amazing covers of his work (I'll throw my vote in with John Cale's version of "Hallelujah," though Rufus Wainwright's is great too.) doesn't take anything away from the power of the originals, particularly for the earlier work.  Other people's voices can sound more pleasant singing "Suzanne", but I don't think anyone could achieve the same transcendent mix of regret and lack of regret that Cohen does.  Scott gets the orchestration point about middle/late work right, though some of those songs are also just crap.

Poetry slams are like any open mic: long streches of the tedious and the unlistenable, sprinkled with moments of charm and magic.

_Anyway_, back to the original point of this post, I think Cohen is engaging in the "fallacy of the excluded middle": there's a huge stylistic gap between laundry lists and fluttering butterflies. Even with a single author, if they've got any range at all, some poems will sing with minimal presentations, and some invite playing along. We've been reading "Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats" to the Little Anachronism (yes, we're going to see _that_ musical and we wanted to prep the little one so we don't have to spend the whole time explaining stuff), and somehow I just can't see those poems and "The Wasteland" being effectively read in the same style. 

Obviously, Cohen really didn't acknowledge the existence (or at least the emotional reality) of anything other than the "artistic" emotions and modes, the ironic, the angsty, the incomprehensibly metaphorical, in other words, the serious. Given that, his screed makes sense, but it's a parody of itself, frankly.

And yet, somehow, Eliot accomplished it. (See recording mentioned above; "Macavity: The Mystery Cat," Side 2, Track 9.)

_Cohen, like Dylan, is an acquired taste._

I guess.  I liked both of them the first time I heard them, which would have been age 10 for Dylan and age 16 for Cohen.  I don't think they're in the same league—Cohen has some amazing songs, but also some boring and indulgent ones; he doesn't do bitter sneering nearly as well as Dylan; and his verse structure changes hardly at all.  I'd say Dylan's voice is better, as well, though Cohen singing "Suzanne" or "First We Take Manhattan" is as good as it gets.

Ahistoricality, the reason people get upset when you say that the covers of Dylan songs are better than his own versions, is that equating a singer's quality with the traditional purity and range of his or her voice is a form of small-mindedness that we're tired of hearing.  Honestly, you aren't saying anything that I didn't hear from my friends in 5th grade.  I find the Byrds' version of "Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man" vapid and meaningless, lacking any of the feeling that Dylan's rich voice conveys.  It's a short step from to saying that Dylan sings "poorly" (I followed your link), to saying that Celine Dion is a great artist because of her remarkable range.

(That doesn't explain the "breathing into a bag" reaction, since your opinion is so common; I stopped being shocked years ago that people don't like Dylan's voice, but I've never stopped being disdainful.)

It's not Dylan's voice that bothers me, as such. There are singers of (roughly) equally poor timbre and purity whose singing I find quite pleasurable (John Prine and Malvina Reynolds are the first who come to mind). And my favorite versions of Dylan and Cohen covers are picked for energy, not shimmering quality (though I'll admit that Joan Baez has both, most of the time).

Actually, I'd say that my problem with Dylan is very similar to my problem with Celine Dion: I honestly don't feel anything when I hear him sing, most of the time, and I get the impression that he doesn't care. If that makes me a philistine, so be it. Whatever he's selling, it just doesn't speak to me. 

That said, I do think that he wrote some fantastic lyrics back in the day, and so did Cohen, but they both got way too full of the idea that anything that dropped out of their brains was "art."

While I don't think you have to read poetry as if it's the difference between life and death, I don't think you have to read it in such a way that it gives actual pain to your listeners.  Have you ever heard the recordings of Robert Frost?  He sounded pretty much like Jonathan Winters, to the point that, when I heard those recordings in high school (about a gazillion years ago when Jonathan Winters was still on television), I very nearly fell under my desk.

I just came across this because [http://www.eaglesfans.com/info/articles/songwriting\_heart\_of\_the\_matter.htm&gt;Don](&lt;a) Henley recommended that lyricists should read "How to Speak Poetry". I was shocked by how counterintuitive the advice was. It seems dishonest to tell people you have strong feelings about something but then act as if you don't as you render the message out loud before an audience. That would strike me as apathy, not respect for the audience, as he alludes with that labored mountain climbing analogy. Performing arts are entertainment, mountain climber meetings are not, and if it were, I would like the presenter to mime out how he compromised that big rock. 

The vast majority of artistically and commercially successful musicians "act" to some degree, often to great degree, including Henley, so I'm shocked to see that this prose essay is so highly regarded, especially given it's wordiness, indirectness and vulgarity.

Sure, Celine Dion is not a great artist by virtue of an amazing range, but it also doesn't help that she doesn't write her own music or that she tastelessly hams up the music she's given. Music is a performance art, and the more elements that can be successfully coordinated to achieve whatever the aim, the better.

Maybe Cohen just sucked as a performer and wanted to convince others the lower the bar to his level.
