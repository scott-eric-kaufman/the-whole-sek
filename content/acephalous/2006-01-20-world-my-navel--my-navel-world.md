## World, My Navel.  My Navel, World.

Looking over what I've written these past many months I notice I've fallen into a comfortable rut of public consumables and quasi-private communications.  A canny manipulator would claim this had been the plan all along: you come for the satire and general vituperation but stay for the desperate pleas of a random but individualized dissertator.  

Tonight I embrace the oscillation: 

Earlier Adam [confessed](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2006/01/friday-afternoon-confessional-david.html) he "sometimes gets sick of listening to music all the
time."  I'll match his confession with one of my own: I _never_ listen to music anymore.  Not really.  When I cook.  Or do the dishes.  Or have the radio on in the car.  Or when it cheaply manipulates my emotions while watching something.  (I'm looking at you,  [Mr. Braff](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=external-search%!F(MISSING)search-type=ss%!i(MISSING)ndex=dvd%!k(MISSING)eyword=scrubs)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1).)  I still want to listen to music . . . only I find it difficult to find the right accompaniment to what I'm reading or writing.  

Once upon a time I could pair my literature with my music with ease.  I would read [Thomas Pynchon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=external-search%!F(MISSING)search-type=ss%!i(MISSING)ndex=books%!k(MISSING)eyword=thomas%!p(MISSING)ynchon)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) and listen to [Lotion](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=external-search%!F(MISSING)search-type=ss%!i(MISSING)ndex=music%!k(MISSING)eyword=lotion)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) or couple [James Joyce](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=external-search%!F(MISSING)search-type=ss%!i(MISSING)ndex=books%!k(MISSING)eyword=james%!j(MISSING)oyce%!)(MISSING)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) and [The Levellers](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=external-search%!F(MISSING)search-type=ss%!i(MISSING)ndex=music%!k(MISSING)eyword=the%!l(MISSING)evellers)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1).  A perfect fit?  The Pynchon [truly truly](http://www.themodernword.com/pynchon/pynchon\_music\_lotion.html).  The Joyce and every other novel I read and every other band I obsessed over were paired according to a logic predicated on nothing more than Kaufmanian contiguity.  I read X while listening to Y and the two are now bound by Krazy Glue in my memory.  Since I don't make many memories anymore which don't involve my desk and books and chair and daily writing routine I no longer create even random associations. 

In its place I become slave to a tune.  What tune?  Whichever one stuck in my head while I cooked or washed dishes or drove somewhere or watched something.  If my iPod could do more than tamp down [Adam](http://adamroberts.com/)'s manuscript I wouldn't be in this mess.  But it has lost the will to play.  So I'm stuck with random hooks setting up house in my head.  

Or doing dishing constantly.  Or having the gorgeous soundtrack to [_Battlestar Galictica_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)B0009Q0F5U)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) on heavy rotation.  (Were it not for the artificial drama it adds to the most mundane activities—_Can he finish morning ablution before that Cylon RIGHT BEHIND HIM strikes!_—I probably would.  Who wouldn't want to listen the [Gayatri Mantra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayatri\_Mantra) _in Sanskrit_ all the time?  Especially when so beautifully rendered.  But still.)  The only alternative is to interrupt my vigorous wall-staring with the latest [Wilco](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)B000BCE90O)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) . . . but that would lead to some unwholesome associations.

Who wants to associate breathtaking music with the suffocation of dissertating?  I certainly don't.  But what choice do I have?  Blog under musical influence?  If I listen while I blog my sense of my words will be scattered by the lyrics in my head.  I have a quiet style any accompaniment will ruin.  (Stop laughing.  I do too have a _quiet_ style.)  

I know the real solution is to find appropriate music for writing about S.W. Mitchell and evolutionarily-influenced historical romances about the Revolutionary War.  I don't think they ever released the soundtrack to [_Johnny Tremain_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=redirect%!F(MISSING)link\_code%!D(MISSING)ur2%!t(MISSING)ag%!D(MISSING)diesekoschmar-20%!c(MISSING)amp%!D(MISSING)1789%!c(MISSING)reative%!D(MISSING)9325%!p(MISSING)ath%!D(MISSING)http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)B000BCE90O%3EWilco%!C(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)a%!E(MISSING)%2360%!B(MISSING)img%!s(MISSING)rc%!D(MISSING)%2334%!B(MISSING)http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.assoc-amazon.com%!F(MISSING)e%!F(MISSING)ir%!F(MISSING)t%!D(MISSING)diesekoschmar-20%!a(MISSING)mp%!B(MISSING)l%!D(MISSING)ur2%!a(MISSING)mp%!B(MISSING)o%!D(MISSING)1%2334%!B(MISSING)%!w(MISSING)idth%!D(MISSING)%2334%!B(MISSING)1%2334%!B(MISSING)%!h(MISSING)eight%!D(MISSING)%2334%!B(MISSING)1%2334%!B(MISSING)%!b(MISSING)order%!D(MISSING)%2334%!B(MISSING)0%2334%!B(MISSING)%!a(MISSING)lt%!D(MISSING)%2334%!B(MISSING)%2334%!B(MISSING)%!s(MISSING)tyle%!D(MISSING)%2334%!B(MISSING)border%!A(MISSING)none%21important%!B(MISSING)%!m(MISSING)argin%!A(MISSING)0px%21important%!B(MISSING)%2334%!B(MISSING)%2F%2362%!B(MISSING))![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1).  Not that all those drums and fifes and bugles would bear repeated listenings . . .

This sounds so familiar. I hardly ever listen to music anymore: it's hard to find anything that isn't either terrifically distracting without being entirely insipid.

And I like to listen to an entire CD several times, read through the liner notes, get a feel for it. Who has \*time\* for that kind of thing anymore?

Le sigh.

So, it seems that somewhere along the way you fell victim to Battlestar Galactica.  It's a sad day when one of the 'original' shows on television is a re-take of a show from the seventies.  Oh well, I guess you can join the cult.

A musicologist friend said to me recently that, having finished two journal papers, a conference paper, a lecture series and designing and writing an entire new undergraduate paper, she was really looking forward to listening to some music. It was (she said) almost as bad as when she was doing her doctorate: three years without listening to any music at all...

And yet we do notice that the undergraduates seem unable to work without music playing. Have they learned a new way of partitioning their attention?

Personally, I can't do it. Nor do I see the point. If it's good music, my attention is taken by it. If it's bad music, my attention is taken up by disliking it. If it's mediocre music, why waste neural cycles on it?

TheInnerSanctum, I'm not above liking a perfectly executed show which just happens to a remake of a total crap show...and the new _BS_ comes damn close to being perfectly executed as anything I've seen on television, well, ever.  The acting's superb.  As is the writing.  As is the soundtrack (mentioned above).  As is the concept.  If you haven't watched the remake because memories of the original frighten you off, I highly recommend a mind wipe and watching it _tabula rasa_.  You'll be impressed, I assure you.

AW, I'm with you on "experiencing a newly purchased CD," and haven't done so _in years_.  With two Wilco exceptions, that is.  To be honest, the only albums I can kind of sort of work to are the last two Wilco albums, but that's really only because I've listened to them so often I can hear them without paying attention to the lyrics.  (I know, I know: First _Battlestar Galatica_, now Wilco.  How much more predictable can I get?)

Jamie, I haven't tried Rilo Kiley while cleaning (and, in a sure sign of the impending demise of my hipness, had them pegged in my head as Rilo _Kelly_), but if that'll help leave vacuum-cleaner tracks in my carpet, I'm game.  Also, I can't help but admire the desire to produce music, since the last time I had that I was single, lonely and prone to sing along to Grant Lee Buffalo albums with the lights dimmed low.  

Michael, I'm increasingly convinced that multitasking is a myth, especially since I used to do it all the time, but now realize how terribly I engaged all my tasks when I "handled them" simultaneously.  Cleaning and driving I'll buy.  Writing and reading, I'm not so sure.  Especially not writing, because, as you say, you don't want to waste neural cycles when all of them should be revved for the task at hand.

What, Scott, you don't like writing to free jazz?  Squonking saxophones - what could be better for those neural pathways?

I don't know about all this.  Cranky old me.  I \*need\* music on all the time.  Right now: disc two of a Joe Meek box set, a creepy little 50s number called "Angela Jones" by the creepily named Michael Cox.  So while I'm typing this, part of me is inhabiting Meek's odd Twin-Peaks-avant-le-lettre aural geography.  I'm in a pretty pink prom dress, but nobody knows I just -- I know! -- killed my best friend Janey so I could steal her boyfriend Bobby.  All that and I can still type!

I do think the right soundtrack is important.  When I'm writing my dissertation, it's gotta be hip-hop.  I need the beats, the thick blobbing of verbiage -- but I also need to chain smoke and pound Dr. Pepper, so I'm not a good model for the life of the mind.  I can safely say, though, that British garage act The So Solid Crew has been a faithful accompaniment to the three chapters I've written so far.  Along with Wu Tang's \*W\* and De La Soul's \*3 Feet High and Rising\* and Jay-Z's \*Black Album.  Maybe my dissertation will include a sountrack album.  And now with iTunes, I have 15,476 songs, or 39.8 days worth of music, at my fingertips.  You never know when the formal complexity of a Judee Sill song will give you the insight into how Frank Stafford's poetry works.  Or something like that.  

Reading is another story.  Here's the story.  When I was reading for my general exams, which involved a wide variety of texts from Old English to now, I remember sitting in my boxers one morning in the 98 degree summer heat, with Japan's The Ruins blaring from my speakers, reading \*Wuthering Heights\*.  That put the KONG in incongruous, all right.  But it worked.  Somehow the sheer violence of the music brought out the brutality of the novel, while the heat made Maryse Conde's Caribbean revision of the novel finally seem feasible to me.  

Sure, music requires attention.  But what's also great about music is that it's a clear rabbit/duck phenomenon.  Put De La Soul on your headphones, kick back, and enjoy the loppy complexity.  Put it on in the background, take out your 600 bar napkins with notes, and start typing a chapter about Toni Morrison.  Without music in the background, I'll just be distracted by rattling pipes, screaming kids, barking dogs, rattling kids, barking pipes, screaming dogs, and other environmental hazzards.  I also find that I can shake my ass in my desk chair while typing -- and keep the beat.  Take that, people with tenure-track jobs and completed dissertations!

I can sympathize with about the getting hooks stuck in your head.  I'm very prone to Ohrwurmer (the German name for this phenomenon; don't the Germans have a name for EVERYTHING?).  What makes it even more maddening is that it's often not even an entire song, but just a small portion of it.  For instance, I have a line-up of two second snippets of 70s songs due to those infomercials for those song collections.  

Oh, and Battlestar Galactica rocks.

Wikipedia claims it's a calque from German, but chauvinism makes me insist it was the other way 'round!

Funnily enough, I've been 'rediscovering' music recently - last night, for the first time in what feels like years, I lay in bed and just \*listened\* to Billie. I generally wake up to [Radio 3](www.bbc.co.uk/radio3) and have that playing sporadically during the day, while doing dishes or cooking, but am finding where I used to find Bach an inspiration - his precise, methodological yet breathtaking music almost a golden mean to aspire to while dissertating - I work better in silence nowadays, much for the same reasons you've stated. I find academic reading almost an impossibility with music now (this is tragic for someone who truly believes in the concept of the reading soundtrack). While writing, only sometimes, and it has to be on the scale of a symphony, otherwise I feels it detracts from the flow. 

Every now and then when I sing around the house, I find it a bit startling that I can. Needless to say, I'm waiting for this dissertation to give me my life back.
