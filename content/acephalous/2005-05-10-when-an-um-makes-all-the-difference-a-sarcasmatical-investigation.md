## When An "Um" Makes All the Difference: A Sarcasmatical Investigation

 * Originally posted at http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/when_an_um_make.html

On a day in which I have referenced Jeff Foxworthy and written, at length, about Paris Hilton, I am the last person who should complain about looking stupid.  However, somewhere else in the Wide World of Blog I [replied](http://www.haloscan.com/comments/jwb1323/111574423007838943/#135095) to a particularly [juvenile comment](http://www.haloscan.com/comments/jwb1323/111574423007838943/#135092) about the location of my lips relative to someone else's posterior with sarcastic faux-beffuddlement:
Um, I know you are but what am I?

All the weight of the sarcasm falls upon that "um," without which I appear to be responding to a juvenile statement with an equally juvenile statement _but without a hint of the superiority_.  So where has my "um" gotten off to?  Why do I look like a mere participant in a puerile pissing contest instead of a smug and superior participant in a puerile pissing contest?  How can I live with an inflated sense of self-worth if no one can see it in all its puffed and ruffled glory?  

The answer, of course, is I will have to redouble my efforts to make a public ass of myself.  This will involve responding to more of [John Bruce](http://mthollywood.blogspot.com/)'s outlandish claims, including 

1.  [John Holbo](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/) and [three elite Mexican gun-runners](http://www.keithboykin.com/upload/Halloween18.jpg) are responsible for the the inner city crack-cocaine epidemic of the 1980s.
2.  [Adam Kotsko](http://adamkotsko.com/weblog/) [never](http://scottcounty.a-p.com/current\_scott/Progress%!p(MISSING)hotos/Burning%!h(MISSING)ouse%!o(MISSING)n%!t(MISSING)h.jpg) [remembers](http://www.engine35.com/training/burnfeb04/DSC\_0065.jpg) [to](http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/gallery/kilauea/erupt/24ds331\_L.jpg) [turn](http://www.raytownfire.com/images/house\_ablaze.jpg) [off](http://www.cs-music.com/features/photos/house-on-fire.jpeg) [the](http://www.huntertownfire.com/Downloads/WallPaper/1024x768/House%!F(MISSING)ire.jpg) [iron](http://www.farmlandfire.com/pictures/training%!h(MISSING)ouse%!f(MISSING)ire%!j(MISSING)pg).
3.  I'm a [woman](http://www.culture.gr/2/21/211/21103m/00/lk03m023.jpg).

I have a tough time ahead, so if you or anyone you know ever thinks about praying, ask them to pray a little prayer for me.  And tell them not to be sarcastic, as I hear He can't brook it any more than John Bruce.

I'm afraid that John Bruce is entirely blind to irony and sarcasm.  He's a bit like one of those people who suffer brain damage in a car accident and can no longer perceive anything on the left side of their field of vision.

The problem right now is that you're giving him the one thing that he desperately wants but doesn't have except for that humorless Stephen M. guy - an audience.

If only I weren't constitutionally incapable of backing away from an argument; then again, responding to him supplies me with much-needed amusement...esp. since I found an article in the latest issue of one of the Americanist journals called "Jack London and Evolution: From Spencer to Huxley."  Virtually no overlap, if you can believe it, and his assumptions are useful to me, wrapped up as they are by his ninth endnote: Richard Hofstadter, _Social Darwinism in American Thought_...

I love how, after spending a couple days involved in discussion at The Valve, while not spending a lot of time there before, I am suddenly one of the Valve's many cultists.

Stephen,

Apparently he's not blind to irony and sarcasm, he sees it, recognizes it, but because it's inconvenient to his argument, he chooses to ignore it.  Today's example: "There always seems to be an alternate reading, an escape clause. I have no idea if Jonathan had such a grant and actually lost it, or if he's making some kind of ironic comment here that he finds satisfying, but nevertheless doesn't mean what it appears to mean."  That's some mean strain of the stupids he's contracted.  I'm also now a "useful idiot," which is odd given how tiny and insignificant my contributions to society'll be _even if_ I become the most important writer on turn-of-the-century American literature and culture the world has ever known.  

Adam,

The Bruce has spoken.  All you can do now, as the kids say, is "deal."

Having a "little man" is great, but not when it flunked out of Special Ed.

When I read passages like this, I'm tempted to believe the jokes on us:  "First he says (to Conscientious Objector): 'We have despised each other enough. Let there be commerce between us." But as soon as CO takes this as some kind of a conciliatory gesture, Holbo makes sure you can't assume that; "By 'let there be commerce between us' I just meant a caravan from one of my posts has reached your blog. Each post can have three. I want the gold and science bonus. I'm trying to discover writing. Admittedly your blog is rather small, but commerce with blogs from different civilizations is worth more.'"

There's no way he can be _that_ stupid, what with the conversation having turned to Civilization III and all.  I'd comment more about his stupendous stupidity, but I've no more stupid-word with which to smart-, clever- or witty-comment about his stupid-post, stupid-comment, stupid-self.

I noticed something today: The quality of my writing here on a given day is inversely proportional to the quality of my dissertating on a given day.  Go figure.

For the last couple of weeks, the quality of my dissertating has royally sucked, alas.

I'm hijacking your CFP Follies thread by posting this monstrosity that recently came into my inbox.  Argh!  The morons in our discipline!  Almost as bad as the morons outside of our discipline (aka Bruce):

Call for articles about The Michael Jackson Trial  

For special issue of the international journal 'Social Semiotics'

\*    How does Michael Jackson's trial, and the associated media spectacle,  

mobilises ideas about gender, race, class, the body, queer, sexuality,  

power, childhood/adulthood, fandom and celebrity?  

\*    What does the reporting tell us about phenomena such as the U.S.  

televised trial, the media event, the use of chat shows and the role of  

personal testimony?  

\*    What are the socio-political contexts and implications of this major  

media spectacle?

The Michael Jackson ³pedophilia² trial has become a staple of global media.  

This new phase of the pop superstar/icon's biography draws attention to the  

volatile mix of race, sexuality, gender and celebrity status that has marked  

media coverage of a range of late-twentieth century "scandals", such as the  

OJ Simpson Trial, Princess Diana, Monica Lewinsky, Mike Tyson, etc.  We are  

interested in using the Michael Jackson trial to investigate the particular  

ways in which his star persona has become the site where a number of  

cultural anxieties about power, childhood, racialized sexuality, and  

masculinity. We are also interested in drawing parallels between this trial  

and other media spectacles, as Marjorie Garber and other scholars have  

termed these phenomena.  We are interested in exploring the reasons the  

Michael Jackson media spectacle has resonated across cultural and national  

borders, the forms of media practices it has enabled and also the particular  

ways in which coverage of this celebrity scandal provides insight to  

contemporary cultural formations.

Jenny Kitzinger is editing a special issue of the journal 'Social Semiotics'  

and is inviting contributions around these and other questions. (Further  

details about the journal are below)

If you are interested please send us a brief outline (no more than one page  

by 20th May. We will then select from these abstracts to invite submission  

of full articles. Articles should be between 4,000 and 8,000 words.

All articles will be subject to peer review.
