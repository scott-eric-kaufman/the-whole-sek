The next week will witness _Acephalous_ reach two milestones: my 1,500th post and my 500,000th visitor.  

But one milestone's already been achieved: namely, my 10,000th comment.  To celebrate my 10,000th comment, I'm reprinting my first.  It was written by "Some Gay Guy" and reads [thus](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/03/your\_daily\_quee.html#comment-4208145):

_Barrett argues that Rodman
intrigues the public because he draws attention to himself "not only on
the basketball court but at the site of sexual energy itself with its
perilous crush of racial, gendered, domestic, and commercial
prohibitions and imperatives."_

Since when is Newport Beach a "site of sexual energy"?

Incidentally, let me say as a fag that I do indeed feel guilty every
time I have casual fag sex. Like all men, I am a rutting, filthy swine,
mired in what I know to be moral squalor and yet pathetically unable to
control my vile appetites, and I demand acknowledgment as such! 

Do you think that's publishable? I'm feeling some heat from my advisor ...

My [second comment](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/03/your\_daily\_quee.html#comment-4208189)'s also worth a read.

So what happened to Some Gay Guy (also commenting as Some Guy)?  Did he get a new pseudonym, or did he, well, cruise to some more happening location?  I remember a comment of his about the difference between the Beautiful and the Sublime that was memorable.

Some Gay Guy's still around, although he doesn't comment anymore.  He got tired of typing, so now when he wants to respond, he stops by my apartment instead.  Not the most economical of systems, mind you, but I think it's an excuse to get out of the house.

Your place is where the party's _at_, clearly, Scott.
