## Stupid Ol' The Tough, Derailing a Post on Joan Didion and Student "Appreciation" of Irony

Even though the Tough has existed for less than 15 minutes, I already hate him, denounce him, and wish him uncreated.  

The most difficult class I teach as Senior Instructor of Literary Journalism--and yes, those are airs--is the one in which I foolishly attempt to convince students who don't know from irony what on God's Green Earth is happening in a [Joan Didion](http://www.nybooks.com/images/levines/didion\_joan-19840510.2.gif) article.  I decided to lighten the ironical load this quarter, eschewing the subtle irony of "Some Dreamers of the Golden Dream" in favor of the hammer of "Comrade Laski, C.P.U.S.A. (M.-L.)."  Here's how the conversation typically progresses:  
 **Me:**  So, class, what's irony?  
**Class:** (_in unison_) I-ron-y is when Chand-ler from _Friends_ says "Could you **_be_** any more in-tell-i-gent."  
**Me:** Alright, that's sarcasm, but let's build on that...

So, as I was saying, the hammer: 
The world Michael Laski had constructed for himself was one of labyrinthine intricacy and immaculate clarity, a world made meaningful not only by high purpose but by external and internal threats, intrigues and apparatus, an immutably ordered world in which things mattered. (65)

Actually, that's not the hammer.  This is the hammer:
He was born twenty-six years ago in Brooklyn, moved as a child to Los Angeles, dropped out of U.C.L.A. his sophomore year to organize for the Retail Clerks, and now, as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party U.S.A. (Marxist-Leninist), a splinter group of Stalinist-Maoists who divide their energies between Watts and Harlem, he is rigidly committed to an immutable complex of doctrine, including the notion thats that the traditional American Communist Party is a "revisionist bourgeois clique," that the Progressive Labor Party, the Trotskyites, and the "revisionist clique headed by Gus Hall" prove themselves opportunistic bourgeois lackeys by making their peace appeal not to the "workers" but to the liberal imperialists; and that H. Rap Brown is the tool, if not the conscious agent, of the ruling imperialist class. (61-62)

Typing that out...imagining for a second that those might be my words...makes me aware of how my pretensions to writing are only a vacuous but succoring fiction...something I tell myself to justify my existence.  Didion simply diminishes, demolishes Comrade Laski clause by clause by clause...as these ellipses indicate, _there's a way in which_ I can analyze it or appreciate it...and I'm inclined, as always, to appreciation.  I'm _this_ close to whipping out _Slouching Toward Bethlehem_, so that I might share the highlights of the titular essay, but I'll refrain.  Because I want to save it.  Sometimes pure, unadulterated admiration of another's prose is the healthiest thing imaginable for a struggling writer...and sometimes it isn't.  But it's far more satisfying that re-re-re-reading the intellectual excrement I've managed to dissertate today.
