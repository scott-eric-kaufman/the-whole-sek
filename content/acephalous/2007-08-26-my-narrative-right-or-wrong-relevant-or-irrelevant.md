## My Narrative, Right or Wrong (Relevant or Irrelevant)

Glenn Reynolds [peers](http://instapundit.com/archives2/008526.php) into the depths of media bias and sighs at the cite before him:
Media credibility takes another hit: Fishbowl DC's [...]
contest wasn't on the up-and-up, [reports](http://machinist.salon.com/feature/2007/08/22/fishbowl\_bots/) Farhad Manjoo. "What's
surprising is not that anyone cheated—online polls are about as
trustworthy as Soviet Bloc elections—but how brazen, and how easy,
the cheating was," he writes. Friends of this year's two [...]
winners built software "bots" that voted thousands of times for each of
them on the Mediabistro site.

"I once had a girlfriend who quit journalism and went into P.R. because she said public-relations work was 'more ethical,'" he writes.  I'm inclined to agree.  That an online poll by a media site was so easily rigged is more evidence of pervasive, perfidious liberal bias.  As Michael Silence writes, that the "[media [is] caught cheating](http://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence/archives/2007/08/media\_caught\_ch.shtml)" is another hit to its credibility, further evidence of its liberal bias.  

One problem with this scenario: [I'm _not_ the media](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/comments\_7228.html#597045).  You heard me right: I actively participated in the rigging of an online poll ... concerning [the "hottest" media type in D.C.](http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlDC/hottest\_media\_types/).  I am become Liberal Media. I aided [Capps](http://www.grammarpolice.net/) and [Andrews](http://outtamindouttasite.typepad.com/outtasite/).  I admit it.  Other people aided their friends.  They admit it.  So I can only ask:
_This_ is what elicits Reynolds' patented "sigh"?

Then I remember:
It's all about _The Narrative_.  

Must remind readers of _The Narrative_.  

Can't let people forget _The Narrative_.

_The Narrative_ may not obtain—it may even be hilariously irrelevant, as here—but it's still _The Narrative_.  Its fires must be stoked, its hunger must be slaked, its every need must be fulfilled, lest it wither before the face of its fundamental untruth.   This reminds me of the old joke: 
How do you get to be a popular blogger?  

Hit the bottom of the barrel, then keep on going.

There are a lot of things about this story that _are_ sigh-worthy: that random bloggers are more technically savvy than the people who run commercial news sights, that commercial news sites are running hottness contests about journalists, and that auto-vote bots are newsworthy in 2007, and that Glenn Reynolds is still considered an important blogger. You could add the absurdity of the Salon writer asking Ogged for his real name to that list: what a wanker.
