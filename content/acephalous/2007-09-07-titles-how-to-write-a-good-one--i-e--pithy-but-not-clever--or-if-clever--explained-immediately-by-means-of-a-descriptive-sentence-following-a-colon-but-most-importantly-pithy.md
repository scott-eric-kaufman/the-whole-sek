## Titles: How to Write a Good One; <em>i.e.</em> Pithy, but not "Clever"; or if "Clever," Explained Immediately, by means of a Descriptive Sentence following a Colon; but, Most Importantly, Pithy

So I've finally named my dissertation:
**Maximal Diversity: Non-Darwinian Evolutionary Theory in Realist and Naturalist Fiction, 1895-1910**

I know what you're thinking: "Scott, including the word 'diversity' in the title is a _wee_ disingenuous, no?"  

Not in the least.  My dissertation was birthed by a single sentence from Stephen Jay Gould's [_The Structure of Evolutionary Theory_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674006135/diesekoschmar-20) (2002):
As the Darwinian centennial of 1909 neared, [Vernon] Kellogg decided to write a volume providing a fair hearing for all varieties of Darwinism, and all alternative views in a decade of maximal agnosticism and diversity in evolutionary theories. (163)

That sentence stuck with me.  When I started reading literary criticism on the period, I noticed that much of it assumed Darwinian theory had been applied globally.  So I went to the library, checked out Kellogg's book, _Darwinism Today_ (1907), and here I am ... the proud owner of a dissertation with the word "diversity" in the title.  

I'm shocked I haven't been hired already.

Actually, I really like "maximal agnosticism" but that has nothing to do with your dissertation.

It's nice to have a title, though I never really cottoned to the vague/pithy+colon form, myself.

Not only is the title very good, but you just wrote your paragraph explaining it (with minor revisions) in your intro (or preface, if you want to preserve the intro from such gestures, which I recommend).

What's the difference between an intro and a preface? (Our department lets either/both slide if you're scrambling to file before a job.) 

And do you really think search committees would hire based only on whether your \_title\_ is about diversity?

Wait, I've gotta go update something right now...

A preface, I once read, is where you get to review your own work. Also where acknowledgements go.

An introduction, I've always thought, was an integral part of the work itself: laying out the structure and parameters for the reader before diving into the substantive chapters.

That's just me, though.

Speaking from personal experience only, the preface was the place for the stuff that didn't fit anywhere else but I wanted to keep in (including acknowledgements).  Plus it was the last thing I revised, even after the conclusion (which was a tacked-on thing with endy-type-stuff I couldn't fit in the last chapter) and the intro (which was how ahistoricality described, although not as good).

It _is_ nice to have a title -- it makes the work seem more substantial, like I'm finishing some identifiable _thing_ instead of a generic dissertation.

As for the introduction/preface distinction, I'm all ears, as my introduction has the unpleasant task of outlining turn-of-the-last-century evolutionary theory to people likely to be wholly unfamiliar with it (in ways, say, Edith Wharton wasn't).

Without seeing the whole work (or whatever portion is drafted at this point) I'm kind of shooting in the dark, but I'd probably put the full-bore explanation of evolutionary theory in the first chapter, and present only a very brief version of it in the introduction. A brief version of _everything_ goes in the introduction, by way of letting your reader know what's to come on the thrill-ride ahead. 

This is a useful exercise, because you will forever be giving brief versions of your research -- in job talks, in seminars, in cocktail parties, in bars, mornings after....

Yes, I find the last one to be the toughest, especially as I'm asking them to sign IRB and consent forms for inclusion into my research at the same time.

Ahistoricality, I'm right there with you, as I'm currently slaving away on my abstract.  A pain -- more annoying than anything I've written in months -- but a useful one.  (But still, a pain.)  I'll address this in more detail later, as I've a post planned on it, but the main thing isn't that I'm introducing one evolutionary theory, but that I'm introducing two main and seven minor strands, as well as differentiating all of them from the non-biological evolutionisms of, for example, Herbert Spencer.  None of the claims I'll make will make sense without that ... but as I type, I'm not sure that's true.  I think it's just that I haven't tried to write it that way yet.  Ugh.  More work ... I mean, _Huzzah!_  More work!

_two main and seven minor strands...._

Wow.

I admit, my immediate reaction is to wonder whether you might be cutting things a _bit_ too fine, but I also know that heated scientific discussions (and their metaphors) have a way of proliferating schools until some dominant narratives develop. 

It might help if you think of the abstract less as a summary or distillation and more as a marketing tool. It's the paragraph that you'd want under your name in an annotated  bibliography, the one that's going to tell your wavering readers (if they're reading the abstract, then they're not really sure if they want to read the book!) what questions they will find answered and whose oxes are gored in the process. By definition, it can't be a complete or thorough summary: it's supposed to be titillating, with promises of excitement and satisfactions to come.

Or you do what I did, and write one sentence per chapter, then edit, and it's a dry-as-dust pseudo-outline.

When I was revising my thesis into a book, the series editor was emphatic that I had to abandon the "Cute Phrase: Explanatory Subtitle" model. Her argument was that she wanted people to find the book in searches and know what it was about as quickly as possible.  Mind you, since then (when I followed her advice, of course) I have felt a bit regretful, plus the result may be precise but it's also bland and forgettable.

Random piece of titling lore: avoid "non-"s.  I have no idea if this is a good piece of advice, but it is simple enough that I have remembered it, and it has a certain plausibility.  Congratulations regardless.
