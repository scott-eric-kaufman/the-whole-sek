. . . after deleting _Acephalous_ from _An Und Für Sich_'s roster, Kotsko & Company have decided to start posting [pictures of people I know](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2007/02/caption-competition.html).  Fear has been struck deep into my heart, but I'm not sure how to retaliate.  If you happen to have any pictures of the [Weblog](http://www.adamkotsko.com/) folk or any of their familiars lying around, I'd love to see them.  In the meantime, consider this:

You were never on that blogroll. 

Kornbluh's ratemyprof made me realize, again, that I would hate to be a woman in academia. They said, "She's hot. That's all I have to say." Then again the rest were really positive and no one said you were hot, just committed. Maybe it would be nice to have one course evaluation come back saying "You're very attractive." Maybe not.

One of my TA evaluations had a kiss-mark on it.

One of my old TA evaluations was a death-threat.

FYI: It is very easy to find pictures of me and 'mine'. Myspace?

Aha!  I thought I was.  Well then, it was an attempt to win back my love after not including me on that blogroll.

I've never looked at Anna's ratemyprof before, but I love this comment:

She's cute and somewhat of a dix, but tries too hard to sound intelligent which hampers her ability to clearly state what it is she is trying to get across. She wants her students to discuss in class but offers no real revelance to discuss about.

"Dix"?  "Offers no real revelance"?  I wonder whether this isn't a case of, I don't know, sour grapes?  I mean, can't these kids see how transparent their ratings are?  (What worries me is that other people can't.)

And I would look you up on Myspace, but I don't do Myspace. Actually, I just tried -- logged in via bugmenot -- but I think it sent you an email instead of taking me to your page.  So ignore that email.  It was me, not The Ugababe or whatever.

There is only one extant picture of me on the Internet.

Let me guess: it's on Anthony's Myspace?

No, I've agreed to never reveal Adam's visage.

I did get that email, it weirded me out. Still, you can get pictures of me by typing in my damn name too. It's not that hard!
