No, you won’t find—especially when he’s [reading his own work](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Pound.html).  Be warned, however, as he does do the police in different voices.  His reading of [Hugh Selwyn Mauberley](http://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/authors/Pound/1939/Pound-Ezra\_04\_EP-Ode-Pour-LElection-de-Son-Sepulchre\_Harvard\_1939.mp3) in 1939 sounds like his answer to [Joyce’s reading](http://www.finneganswake.org/joyce1.mp3) of _Finnegans Wake_,
right down to the exaggerated (and, in Pound’s case, affected) Irish
accent.  Listen to how Joyce reads the line “a man and his bride
embraced between them” and tell me he doesn’t ham it up.  (You can
try.  I won’t listen.) The Joyce reading is from the ALP section of the
_Wake_, and the text he reads is transcribed [here](http://www.finneganswake.org/joycereading.htm).

SEK: Thanks for this post! Despite your preference for Pound, listening to Joyce was a joy. This miracle that is the internet continues to amaze. Wow. - TL

Pound's reading manner was more of a Yeats rip-off.

Although, man, can you imagine seeing Yeats read and thinking "Whoa! That guy's really COOL!"? (Bitterness talking: When I went to a Halloween party dressed as Yeats, a guy asked "What are you supposed to be? A nerd?")
