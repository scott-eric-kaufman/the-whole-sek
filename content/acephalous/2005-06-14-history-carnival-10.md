The [History Carnival #10](http://cliopolitical.blogspot.com/2005/06/history-carnival-10.html) is up on [Spinning Clio](http://cliopolitical.blogspot.com/) and Y.T. gets two nods.  Sort of.  "Scott Kaufman" is credited with "peek[ing] under Clio's blouse" for [this post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/ultrafreudian\_p.html) over here.  "Scott Eric Kaufman" is credited with initiating a discussion about "oversimplified historical causation" for [this post](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/crypto\_communisto\_conflagration\_100\_guaranteed\_or\_happenstance\_and\_identity/) over at the Valve.  I believe the good folks at Spinning Clio have done me the favor of not associating one with the other.  I only hope the folks they point over here don't read this post.  Then the game'd be all up.  

[NOTE TO SPOUSES: The History Carnival has a section called "Welcome To...Medieval Times!"  Much good for spouses to read there.]

Heh, I meant to do that, yeah that's the ticket.  By the way, Barista also got two mentions.

I appreciate the consideration.  I wouldn't want to associate myself with myself either, what with all the trash I write...
