That was an awesome wedding. That backyard was the site of many a wonderful moment in my life, but that day was certainly the best. 

Congratulations to you both.

Congratulations.

The wedding itself was very nice, but I still think the idea of getting married outdoors in Louisiana in July is just a little crazy...

I especially dig the medieval spelling of 'because'.  That Chaucer was a crazy old cat.
