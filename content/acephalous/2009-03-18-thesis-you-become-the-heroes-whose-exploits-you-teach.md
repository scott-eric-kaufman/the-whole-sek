_It is 6:45 a.m.  A not-quite-awake-yet SEK exits his third-floor apartment to teach.  As he plants his left foot on the ground floor, he notices THE MAN with an over-large screwdriver trying to pry the
screen off a window._

**SEK:** Need some help?

**THE MAN:** I've got it under control.

**SEK:** (_suspiciously_) What's going on?

**THE MAN:** Lost my keys. (_shrugs innocently_) I live here.

**SEK:** (_drowsily_) No you don't.

_THE MAN with the Costco-sized screwdriver locks eyes with him.  For the first time SEK understands what sleep deprivation may have wrought . . . but the thought twinkles out of consciousness as quickly as it had entered when a door on the floor above slams shut.  THE MAN and SEK look at the landing above and listen to the footsteps._

**MAN:** (_sheepish-yet-somehow-still-threateningly_) Seems I got the wrong apartment.  I live (_points in a direction roundaboutly away_) over there.

_THE MAN ambles menacingly away and SEK resumes walking to class.  Seconds later it dawns on SEK that he may have confronted AN ARMED BURGLAR because he'd been half-asleep._

**SEK:** 
(
_aloud_
) He may have just done **_what_** now?

It seems your luck may be improving.  Pre-PhD SEK would have gotten shot and then discover students having sex in his hospital room, but only after the ambulance charges him for a ride because his health insurance was accidentally canceled by the library.

So, things are looking up!

Why not as _he notices THE MAN with an over-large screwdriver trying to pry the SCREEN off a window_

**SCREEN** Help me SEK! Help me! You're my only hope!

**MAN** Can it, scrappy; only one of us is walking out of here alive, and it won't be me!

**SEK** Huh?

'SEK was grateful for the weighty heft of the cricket bat in his right hand -- so long as he carried _that_, no punk-ass thief was going to mess with him.  "Silly mid _on_ muthafucker," he cried, launching himself at the cowering crook.'

I like Adam's response. Whether true or not or whatever, aesthetically you should have turned to another beat once he said he lived "over there." Or maybe you were just too sleepy. . . .

It's like you people _want_ me to be stabbed.  (Or lie about it, which is the same thing.)  (Only to you.)  (And my credibility.)

Are you sure he wasn't working for the psycho-parent who threatened to beat you up?
