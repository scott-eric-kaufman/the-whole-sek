## Queering Early America; or Ask an Irresponsible Question, Get an Answer You Don't Deserve

Earlier I complained about a call over an academic listserv that asked how to broach the topic of sexual orientation in pre-Civil War American literature.  My complaint, you'll remember, concerned the state of the profession when someone has been hired to teach a course he or she isn't qualified to teach; and how some "scholars" attempt to impose an ahistorical theoretical framework on a particular historical moment with which they're only passingly familiar.  Well, as the title indicates, this particular "scholar"'s theory-induced laziness has been rewarded, amply, with the sort of thoughtful and knowledgable answer this particular "scholar"  should've been able to produce _prior_ to being hired.  To wit:
I think the best way to do it is to move away from our current culture's concept of sexual orientation altogether and look at it instead from a viewpoint of a different culture's differing forms of male-male and female-female intimacy, some of which were sexual and some of which might have been but we can't tell and some of which were not.  Here's a hodge podge of historical and literary sources:

Caleb Crain's \_American Sympathy\_ has material on Charles Brockden Brown's intimate male friendships.

E. Anthony Rotundo, \_American Manhood\_, treats 19th century middle class male-male romantic friendships.  Also see his "Romantic Friendship: Male Intimacy and Middle-Class Youth in the Northern United States, 1800-1900," Journal of Social History, 23;1 (1989), which became part of his book.

Jonathan Ned Katz, \_Love Stories\_, discusses Lincoln and other male-male intimate relationships in the 19th century,  There's also his \_Gay American History\_ and \_Gay/Lesbian Almanac\_ which have lots of primary materials.

Caleb Crain, "Lovers of Human Flesh: Homosexuality and Cannibalism in Melville's Novels," American Literature, 66;1 (March 1994) has a long discussion of Typee; James Creech, \_Closet Writing/Gay Reading\_ discusses Melville's \_Pierre.\_, and there is, of course, Moby Dick.  
Robert K. Martin's \_The Homosexual Tradition in American Poetry\_ discusses Whitman and lesser known pre-Civil War writers such as Fitz-Greene Halleck.  See also Martin's \_Hero, Captain, Stranger\_ on Typee.

There is, obviously, lots of material on Whitman.  I've had great success teaching the 1855 edition of \_Leaves of Grass\_ and comparing its treatment of male-male homoeroticism to the 1860 version of the Calamus poems.  See also Martin's "Knights-Errant and Gothic Seducers: The Representation of Male Friendship in Mid-Nineteenth-Century America," in Martin Duberman, Martha Vicinus & George Chauncey, Jr., \_Hidden from History: Reclaiming the Gay and Lesbian Past\_.

John D'Emilio and Estelle Freedman, \_Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America\_ has a good amount of historical material on same-sex intimacy in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Jonathan Goldberg, "Bradford's 'Ancient Members' and 'A Case of Buggery...Amongst Them,'" in Andrew Parker, Mary Russo, Doris Sommer, and Patricia Yaeger, \_Nationalisms and Sexualities\_ discusses the power dynamics of male-male intimacy among the Pilgrims as depicted in \_Of Plymouth Plantation\_.  See also Michael Warner "New English Sodom" re the Puritans, in \_American Literature\_ (1993, I believe) and his essay "Thoreau's Bottom," Raritan, 11:3 (1992 Winter)William and Mary Quarterly's January 2003 issue is entitled "Sexuality in Early America."

Mary Chapman and Glenn Hendler, \_Sentimental Men: Masculinity and the Politics of Affect in American Culture" has a number of essays that you might find useful.

Merrill D. Smith, ed., \_Sex and Sexuality in Early America\_ has both literary and historical essays on male-male and female-female intimacy.

There's also a wealth of material on female-female romantic friendships, passing women, lesbian criticism of Emily Dickinson.  Carroll Smith-Rosenberg's "The Female World of Love and Ritual," although rightfully critiqued in certain ways, is still quite useful and accessible.  Mary Beth Norton's \_Founding Mothers and Fathers\_ has a good chapter on T.

God bless you, Robert Kaplan, God bless you.

Excellent points, Acephalous.  This blog has come a long way from when it merely dealt with issues such as which is better, the old or new "Battlestar Galactica."  Now it's darn close to filling the vacuum left by the late, great "Invisible Adjunct."

Excellent points, Mr. Cephalous.  I find you to be in agreement on this with Walter Benn Michaels, who wrote, "The emergence of racial pluralism is thus simultaneous with the emergence of cultural pluralism, which is to say that, by understanding identity as the privileged object of social contest, pluralism makes race and culture structurally equivalent and formally interchangeable."  Further, as Louis Hartz stated even more succinctly, "The strange agonies the Southerners endured trying to break out of the grip of Locke and the way the nation greeted their effort, stand as a permanent testimony to the power of that idea."

Señor Skein, don't you have qualifying exams to be studying for?  How can you justify spending all these, um, minutes arguing with yourself when you know that a certain New Deal Modernist will be tearing you another one in less than 14 days?  Not that I don't admire your gumption, mind you.  Then again, I'm a little light in the "have a head" department, so I'm not sure I'd take my admiration with much more than some spilled salt...
