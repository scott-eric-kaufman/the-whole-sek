[This](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/09/fyi-for-visitors-from-uniwatch.html) is beginning to [get tiresome](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=20946#comment-990145).  If you want to come at me, come at me.  I'll argue with you!  Just ask anyone who's ever met me (and a whole host of folks who haven't).

It was witless, not cowardly. Nobody fears the wrath of an assclown.

Assclowns think they're to be feared, though.  Despite a lifetime's worth of evidence to the contrary, they think they're forces to be reckoned with.

Impersonation is the sincerest form of assclownery.

I dunno, SEK.   I have frequently been an assclown on the internet myself and I've no delusions of being feared.  Some of us just get something out of being an assclown.

God, I really hope there aren't assclowns who think they're intimidating.  That'd make me rethink whether or not I'd like to be associated with them.

I'm still waiting for my "Why Lukács and Althusser are a Fruitcakes" write-up!

Well, let's see, if Greenwald is on any meds, did he get off of them? Simply revert to old form? 

Although the fellow wasn't a chronic anti-Semite when he was doing that, and whoever this is appears to be so. So probably not Greenwald. Also there was no Greenwaldian link or story to cheer-lead on, so that should remove him from the suspect pool rather nicely. Apologies to Glenn for even thinking that. 

This may be unlikely, but swap any unhinged IP addresses between folks and who knows what will be found. Probably assclowns, like you say...
