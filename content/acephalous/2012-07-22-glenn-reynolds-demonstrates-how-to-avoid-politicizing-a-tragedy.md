As everyone who pays attention to political blogging knows, tragedies  are too tragic to politicize. Discussing gun control in the wake of a  tragic shooting is despicable political opportunism. Discussing the _discussion_ of gun control in the wake of a tragic shooting, however, isn’t  politically opportunistic because it’s a morally neutral, second-order  discussion about a discussion. It’s a meta-discussion about the  propriety of having a political discussion in the wake of a tragic  shooting, meaning it’s an apolitical discussion whose participants are  immune to the charge that they’re violating decorum by politicizing a  tragedy. For example, here’s Glenn Reynolds’s [first post about Aurora](http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/147021/):

A TRULY AWFUL [mass shooting in Denver.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9414264/Batman-cinema-shooting-14-people-shot-dead-and-50-injured-in-Denver.html) At the Batman premiere.

UPDATE:  More [here.](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/07/20/After-Shooting-Tragedy-Aurora-Chick-fil-A-Gives-Free-Meals-To-Police-Working-Case)

It doesn’t exploit the tragedy by using it to score cheap political  points, so no one could accuse him of political opportunism. But here’s  his [second post](http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/147027/) on the tragic shooting:

POLITICAL OPPORTUNISM:  [CNN’s Piers Morgan, First to Use Colorado Tragedy to Assault Second Amendment Rights.](http://pjmedia.com/tatler/2012/07/20/cnns-piers-morgan-first-to-use-colorado-tragedy-to-assault-second-amendment-rights/) I’m sure he won’t be the last.

Others may blame [Hollywood.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/2461820/Our-attitude-to-violence-is-beyond-a-joke-as-new-Batman-film-The-Dark-Knight-shows.html) In both cases, it’s a mix of opportunism and a desire not to confront   the existence of evil.  Well, okay, in Piers Morgan’s case, it’s not   much of a mix, really.

UPDATE:  [Left Blames Aurora Shooting On Rush Limbaugh.](http://twitchy.com/2012/07/20/left-blames-aurora-shooting-on-rush-limbaugh/) Of course they do.  Hey, never let a tragedy go to waste, when you might use it to smear an opponent.

Every time something like this happens, [they roll out the blood libels.] (http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703667904576071913818696964.html?mod=WSJ\_Opinion\_LEADTop)

Because conservative bloggers have established that it’s not  political opportunism to discuss political opportunism, this technically  doesn’t qualify as an exploitation of the tragic shooting, because  pointing out other people’s political opportunism isn’t politically  opportunistic—even though the people doing the pointing are  ideologically opposed to the people they’re pointing at. Every  conservative blogger knows that. Reynold’s [next post](http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/147033/) qualifies as non-opportunistic for the same reason:

FIRST, ABC NEWS CONNECTS THE COLORADO SHOOTING WITH THE TEA PARTY, [now Brian Ross says oops, sorry about that.](http://mrctv.org/videos/brian-ross-admits-he-was-wrong-says-shooting-suspect-not-connected-tea-party)

Reaction:  [“Brian Ross must be fired by the end of the day.”](http://www.jammiewf.com/2012/abc-news-hey-sorry-about-that-tea-party-conection-to-co-shooter/)

What’s pathetic is that _every time,_ they so clearly want to   blame tragedies like this on the Tea Party.  I don’t generally like   these calls for firings, and Ross was no doubt just reading what a   producer sent him, but . . .  They know how to be exquisitely sensitive   and non-prejudgey when it might be a Muslim or some other protected   minority, so maybe the only way to encourage them to show better   judgment the rest of the time is to cost _some_ people their jobs.  Who was the producer?  Meanwhile, I look forward to the libel suit. . . .

STILL MORE:  Prof. Stephen Clark writes:  “Yes, but ‘subculture’    suggests a smaller group than it actually is.   The condescension   implicit in these repeated attempts by the likes of Ross is widely   shared.  And though observed frequently, these acts highlight one of the   great cultural divides yet to be fully examined.  Academics like Haidt   have only scratched the surface by shining a light on the divide.”

There’s nothing politically opportunistic about this post—despite its  implicit defense of the Tea Party and explicit criticism of progressive  thought. There’s also nothing politically opportunistic about [the next post](http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/147039/):

And what   made Ross make a beeline straight for the Tea Party website in the first   place?”  Reckless disregard?

No apology by tonight, and the demand goes to $5   million.  Oh, and guys, be sure to preserve all records, browser   histories, etc. for litigation. . . .

YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT _IS_ RECKLESS DISREGARD JUST PUTTING BRIAN ROSS ON THE AIR:  I had forgotten [this libel case involving Brian Ross](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/20/us/wayne-newton-libel-award-is-cut-to-5-million-by-judge.html) until reader Rich Andrews sent the link.  Key bit:

Judge Crocker said Wednesday that he was convinced the  NBC News  reporters, Brian Ross and Ira Silverman, had ”serious  subjective doubts  as to the truth of the broadcasts” but went ahead  anyway.

Frankly, at this point, just hiring the guy should send your libel   insurance carriers into a frenzy.  And would you want to be deposed   about _why_ you went ahead and hired him, after such a record of untrustworthiness? . . .

UPDATE:  How bad is Brian Ross?  [Even Wonkette is calling for him to be fired:](http://wonkette.com/478865/abc-news-should-fire-brian-ross-and-other-notes-on-being-terrible)

Jesus fucking Christ on a hotplate. Brian Ross and his  BLOTTER  INVESTIGATIVE TEAM googled for a few minutes and didn’t bother  trying to  confirm anything and wow, huh, look at that, _he was wrong._ . . .

Tea Party people on the Internet are furious over this, and they have   every right to be, because it’s an egregious, early error that will   color the impressions of people no matter how frequently or aggressively   it’s retracted. Can Brian Ross! Put him in the goddamn street. He is   constantly wrong, at reporting on national television.

Would you write a libel policy for an outlet that employed him?

Some people   would nonetheless be chastened by such an experience.  Ross not so much,   apparently.

JOURNALISM PROF. JOSEPH CAMPBELL:  [Slow to learn: Lesson for journos in Brian Ross’ egregious error on ABC.](http://mediamythalert.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/slow-to-learn-lesson-for-journos-in-brian-ross-egregious-error-on-abc/)

Brian Ross’ appalling error linking the Tea Party  movement to the  suspected Batman-movie shooter in Colorado demonstrates  anew how slow  journalists can be in grasping an elementary lesson of  disaster  coverage: Resist temptation to report more than you can  immediately  verify.

In the hours just after a disaster, journalists tend to be especially   prone to error and imprecision, as Ross, the chief investigative   correspondents for ABC News, amply demonstrated in declaring today on   Good Morning America:

“There is a Jim Holmes of Aurora, Colorado, page on the Tea Party   site as well, talking about him joining the Tea Party last year.

“Now, we don’t know if this is the same Jim Holmes,” Ross added, “but it is a Jim Holmes of Aurora, Colo.”

The suspect arrested in the shootings early today at a movie theater   in Aurora, Colorado, is named James Holmes. But he is not the “Jim   Holmes” to whom Ross referred, and the suspected killer has no known   connections to the grassroots Tea Party movement, which advocates   restraints in government spending. . . .  Whatever the reason, his error   on a television program that attracts 4.5 million viewers was   inexcusable — and eminently preventable.

In the swirling uncertainty that invariably marks the hours after a   disaster, journalists are well-served to show deliberation and   restraint, to be mindful that error and distortion often blight the   first reports of dramatic events.

Plus, the emptiness of ABC’s apology.

JAMES TARANTO:  [With Extreme Prejudice:  How ABC News “investigates” a horrific crime.](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444464304577539020532654912.html?mod=WSJ\_Opinion\_MIDDLETopOpinion)

At this point it’s been twenty four hours since Glenn Reynolds  learned about the tragic shooting. During those twenty four hours, he  wrote fourteen posts and thirteen updates about the tragic shooting.  Despite the fact that thirteen of the posts and twelve of the updates  concern Brian Ross’s remarks about the Tea Party, Glenn Reynolds  believes that none of those thirteen posts or twelve updates exploit the  tragic shooting because he’s only discussing the discussion, not the  tragedy itself. That warrants repeating:

Even though Glenn Reynolds writes _thirteen posts_ and _twelve updates_ about  Brian Ross in the twenty four hours following the tragic shooting, he  believes he is not being politically opportunistic because he’s  discussing the discussion, not the tragedy itself. This is because Glenn  Reynolds is using Brian Ross’s remarks about the Tea Party, not the  tragic shooting itself, to further a campaign to have Brian Ross fired  for his remarks about the Tea Party. This is _not_ political  opportunism, even if it’s meant to prevent political opponents of the  Tea Party from saying anything about guns or gun control in the hours  after a tragic shooting, because Glenn Reynolds is discussing the  discussion, not the tragedy itself.

Only—_no_. The evidence above speaks for itself. Glenn  Reynolds clearly exploited Brian Ross’s remarks about the Tea Party as a  means of forwarding his anti-gun control position. His belief—shared by  many conservative bloggers—that second-order  exploitations of a tragedy don’t qualify as exploitative is simply  wrong. So too is his belief—again shared by many conservative  bloggers—that one oppositional political remark about a tragedy grants  them license to write endlessly about that remark without having to  worry about appearing politically opportunistic. Any statement made in  the furtherance of a political agenda qualifies as a a political  statement, and given both the content and volume of Reynolds’ posts and  updates in the wake of the tragic shooting, it’s fair to say that not  only has Reynolds politicized this tragedy, he’s done so in a manner  that deserves scorn.

He should be embarrassed by his response to this tragedy, not because  it’s political—politicizing a tragedy isn’t inherently despicable—but  because of the breathlessness of the exploitation. He clearly _enjoys_ having the opportunity to exploit a tragedy to further his political  agenda, because he believes himself shielded against moral scolds by his  sophistic insistence that discussing a discussion isn’t political. It  is. What makes him despicable isn’t his incorrect belief that he’s  operating apolitically so much as the self-satisfied smirk on his face  when he claims he is.

**UPDATE:** Has any man ever been so [doggedly commited](http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/147156/) to the cause of self-satire?

REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS OF [this month’s massacre in Chicago.](http://legalinsurrection.com/2012/07/remembering-chicagos-victims/) “A mass murder like Aurora, Colorado, naturally grabs the headlines   and attention, as it should.  A presidential recognition of the murders   is appropriate.  Yet more than twice as many people have been murdered   this month in the president’s hometown of Chicago than were killed in   the Aurora shooting.  They are just statistics for whom there will be no   presidential visits or flags flown at half staff.”

Well, since Chicago already has very strict gun control, these deaths can’t be turned to political use.

No, I think not.
