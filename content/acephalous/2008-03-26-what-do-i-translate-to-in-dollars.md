Were I a currency speculator, I'd wager [my price](http://citizense.blogspot.com/2008/03/miminum-of-300000-sek-in-prize-money-at.html) to be about [86 percent higher](http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%!A(MISSING)en-US%!A(MISSING)official&hs=mjM&q=300000%!F(MISSING)3500&btnG=Search) than my worth in dollars ... or 86 percent lower than [my debt in dollars](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/03/even-more-of-th.html) ... or is my debt in dollars inflated by 86 percent the price of me?

Now you know why I'm not in currency speculation.Â  (As if you needed [further proof](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/01/half-a-million.html#comment-98724116).)
