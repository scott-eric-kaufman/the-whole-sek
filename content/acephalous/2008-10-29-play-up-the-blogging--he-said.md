"I'm surprised you didn't focus on the blogs," he said.

"Talk about your readership," he said.

"Tell them about the publicity you can bring their department," he said.

"Focus on what you bring no other candidate does," he said.

"Impress them with numbers for your service column," he said.

"Do [[what y'all said I should do](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/10/my-wretched-cov.html#comments)]," he said.

And to think I almost left the blogging off entirely.  Seems now that I've finished my dissertation, my advisor doesn't mind my knack for self-promotion quite so much.  My crass suggestion that I list every major news outlet that's interviewed and quoted me about academic blogging?  

"You've got bona fides," he might well've said.

"Everett, my beard itches," I might well've replied:

But only with the reference to the singing and dancing, not the lynching or unspeakable what-not.

Hmmmm, I wonder about that advice.  I think play up the visibility/access that blogging has made possible for you, but every hiring committee should have at least 2 younger faculty on it who already know your name from this blog who can do that for you with their colleagues.  For those who haven't heard of you, better to illustrate the effects of the blogging.  Just my 2 cents.  We're not doing any hiring this year and next year looks worse.
