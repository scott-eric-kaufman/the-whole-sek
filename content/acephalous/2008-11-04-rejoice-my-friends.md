Looks like this blog will be back in business tomorrow.  

No more typing through crossed fingers.

No more anxiety masquerading as intellect.

No more speaking out mouth-sides.  

Come tomorrow this blog will be about literature again.  

(Unless I've jinxed it.  In which case blame me.  Because here at The Jews we care about customer satisfaction.  The Jews are here for all your scapegoating needs!  Got buboes?  The Jews filled your well with baby blood!  Got economic depression?  The Jews filled their banks with your gold!  The Jews.  THEY DID IT!)

It's the opposite transition for me.  (Or maybe the same one?  Hmm.)  Obama's victory means that this is the critical time when i need to get to work.  And maybe even start a blog.  About work.
