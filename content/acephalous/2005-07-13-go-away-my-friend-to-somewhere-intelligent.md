Loyal Readers, I urge you not to read this humble web-of-logs tonight.  Those who do will learn nothing that will aid in the Opening of Academic Essays.  Nor will they acquire knowledge--in the form of Irrelevent Personal Information transmitted in the form of Amusingly Innaccurate Etymological and Citational Histories of Obscure Words--about the Trauma that was Sherwood Middle and Woodlawn High School.  Reading the Ramblings of He Who Is A. Cephalous will inform you of nothing of the sort tonight.  Instead, I recommend you avoid this blog and read the [devilishly and unfairly researched responses](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/theorys\_empire\_ersatz\_theoretical\_ecumenicalism\_criticism\_qua\_criticism/#comments) to the comments and criticisms of his essay on the Institutional History of Theory.  Maybe when you read them, [the Venerable Michael Berube](http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/comments/678/) will have tossed his pennies in the Mix.  Glory be!

Seriously, Glory F. Be.   Or Glory F.'in Be.  Someone please teach me--or, as they say in Louisiana, "learn me"--how to cuss correctly.  'Cause I'm cussin' for emphasis, not profanity, and I don't know whether I ought to conjugate that "F." for the verb it actually is or leave it all gerundive-like.  Because I'm so simultaneously postmodernly High and Low that I can make the Lowest of the Lowest gestures and still demand the Most Tightwad and Pantywaist of Grammatical Niceties!

Bow down before me, Gentle Reader, and read No More.  For it is Nonsense deserving of Captial Letters!
