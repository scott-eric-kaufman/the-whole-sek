## UPDATE: African-American Studies Scholar Responds

Early this afternoon, I received a second response concerning the Casper Affair.  It's from one of the (many) African-American Studies scholars who received one of Casper's (many) emails.  I secured permission to reprint his response sans name, as he wishes to remain anonymous for the time being.

Dear Mr. Kaufman,

I apologize for not responding sooner, but in one of the umpteen emails describing your racial insensitivitiy you said you wanted us to respond seriously. So I read your _Acephalous_ website and I looked at your picture, and I'll be damned if I can tell whether you're a white, black, Asian or any other kind of supremacist. Son, _you have no head_.  Was the head you don't have a white head?  Was it a black one?  How am I supposed to decide whether you a _white_ supremacist.  For all I know, you could be my nigger.

I did search for this Casper person accusing you, and I hate to tell you, but the guy who called you a racist is _a dead klansman_. Friendly my black ass. I once read all these Southerners were gentlemen, and by all accounts they was plenty polite at their lynchings: "Is that rope tight enough, nigger?" "Are you having problems breathing, nigger?" They was plenty polite, alright. So on account of me not knowing whether you my nigger or not, and on account of the fact that you being accused of being a racist by the ghost of Otis Jebediah Cracker, IV, I have determined that it is only right and prudent that these and all future allegations be laughed out of my inbox, and your life, with a press of the delete key. I would guess my esteemed colleagues have already done the same.

P.S. If you my nigger, feel free to respond.  If you _ain't_ my nigger, you must append a lengthy contextualization of these words which just I wrote you. Can't just quote all my "niggers" back to me thinking my dumb dark brain will understand my own damn context, and I don't want to spend all next weekend writing myself letters or finding dead klansman to write them for me.

Next time someone cracks wise about humorless, oversensitive identitarian thinkers, you know where to link.

Well, there's some hidden context in that SEK seems to imply that the identity of the writer will allow a parsing sympathetic to his cause.  I take it as a matter of faith, but, well, it'll be nice when the author speaks in her own name.  That's just consistent with SEK's comments on speaking in name versus anonymously.

Still, that caveat notwithstanding, this was just almost funny enough to justify the whole sordid affair.  At least I hope so.  Hang in there, SEK.

That was masterfully done. 

So the dude going by Casper is merely some guy using the name of a former KKK nut (but I repeat myself) to accuse you of white supremacy. 

Now that's Chutzpa. And dripping with irony.
