On an entirely unrelated note, everyone who ever went through "that phase" should read McSweeney's [Exerpts from the Diary of an Aspiring Death-Metal Frontman](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2005/7/8singal.html).  You really should.  You can't spend your entire life laughing at everybody else.  Sometimes it's healthy to realize how shallow your depths once were.
