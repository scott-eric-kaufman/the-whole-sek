In addition to its many signposts, _Fingerprints_ (1892) goes out of its way to cater to the colorblind:
For the sake of those who are deficient in the colour sense and therefore hardly able, if at all, to distinguish even the blue numerals in Figs. 20, 21, I give an eleventh example, Plate 15, Fig. 22, printed all in black. (95)

I'm not sure how many readers of my dissertation will be colorblind, but now I'm tempted to print half of it in blue just to have an excuse to add redundant bits in black.Â  The beast will be 1,000 pages long if it's 100.
