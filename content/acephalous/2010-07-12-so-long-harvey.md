## So long, Harvey

Harvey Pekar wasn’t included on [the
 list of people I’m officially allowed to mourn](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/03/an-annoying-anonymous-person-writes-why-is-it-any-time-anyone-hipsters-or-academics-are-supposed-to-like-dies.html), but that doesn’t 
mean I won’t mourn [his
 passing](http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2010/07/cleveland\_comic-book\_legend\_ha.html) anyway. I first came to _American Splendor_ too 
early—when I started reading _Love and Rockets_ and _Cerebus_
 in 1993—and then too late—after the release of the film _American 
Splendor_ in 2003—so while I understood it, I never truly “got” his 
appeal. I appreciated his ear for language, but as a teenager thought 
what it captured unworthy of print, and as a literary scholar had 
encountered many similarly talented ears and was, therefore, less 
impressed by it than I should have been. But when I read the news of 
his passing earlier today, I realized something:

I knew Harvey Pekar.

I didn’t _know him_ know him, but like all of his readers, I 
knew him as well as you know me. Pekar was a proto-blogger, if you 
will, because he turned his life into something worthy of public 
consumption. _Our Cancer Year_ is a grueling read not because 
all cancer entails struggle, but because the patient stricken with it is
 someone whose failed dreams, stunted career, and intimate thoughts are 
familiar to us. We may not have known Harvey Pekar, but we knew “Harvey
 Pekar,” and unlike artists for whom the distance between characters and
 self is meticulously kept, in this case it really is just a matter of 
quotation marks.

Rest in peace, Harvey. Lord knows you deserve some.

As a mid-grade hospital employee/comics dork he was on my official list. Goodbye, Harv.

A sad passing. I just picked up a GN he recently worked on -- _The Beats_. A snazzy little project that will probably be overlooked next to the fame of _American Splendor_, but nonetheless a reflection of Pekar's gritty genius.

It's a shame about Harvey. It's a greater shame that Vertigo discontinued the American Splendor minis that they were putting out. For the first time his comics were getting into mom and pop comic shops that wouldn't have carried his self-published works. I taught one of those stories in a composition course to great effect.
