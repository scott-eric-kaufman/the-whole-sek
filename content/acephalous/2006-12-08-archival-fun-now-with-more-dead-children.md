From the _New York Times_, 31 August 1898:

**
BURIED ALIVE BY PLAYMATES
**

————

**Bernard Owens of Troy a Victim of Mock Spanish-American War.**

TROY, N.Y., Aug. 30.—Bernard Owens, aged eight, was accidentally killed yesterday afternoon by playmates.  With some other boys he had organized companies, representing the Americans and Spaniards.  They attacked each other in a sham battle.  

Young Owens fell.  Picked up as dead, he was buried in a quickly dug grave under several feet of earth.  Subsequently he was forgotten and this morning, when the body was recovered, he was really dead.

The alarming realism of turn-of-the-last-century play aside, the questioning of Owens' playmates must have been something else:

				**Detective:** So Bernard—

**Young Jimmy:** —Bucky.  He's Bucky.

**Detective:** Bucky?  What?  Oh, [I see](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky\_O%!N(MISSING)eill) ... so _Bucky_ was killed at the Battle of San Juan Hill?

**Young Jimmy:** Yessir.

**Detective:** Then you and Stan (_points to Stan_) thought to bury Bucky alive?

**Young Jimmy and Young Stan:** (_in unison_) Yessir.

**Detective:** And then you left to eat dinner?

**Young Jimmy and Young Stan:** (_in unison_) Yessir.

**Detective:** And then you came back the next day and found him dead?

**Young Jimmy's Mom:** (_sobbing_) What's to become of my Jimmy!  Please, officer, you can't arrest him!  He's all I got!  

**Detective:** Don't worry, pretty lady, this one's (_puts hand on Jimmy's head and musses his hair_) not going anywhere.  Just havin' some harmless fun, you were, right boys? 

**Young Jimmy and Young Stan:** (_nod silently in unison_)

**Detective:** Next time you two rascals bury someone alive—and
you listen close now, as I don't aim to be coming back here in two
weeks and finding another dead kid, you hear?  Next time you bury
someone alive, _don't return to the scene of the crime_.  I know you want to, but you can't, hear, 'less you want them to catch you and break this sweet thing's (_points to Young Jimmy's Mom_) heart?  Clear?

**Young Jimmy and Young Stan:** (_nod vigorously in unison_) Yessir!

**Detective:** Good. (_turns to Young Jimmy's Mom_) Now, what was that you said about your famous homemade apple pie?

**Young Jimmy's Mom:** You must be mistaken, Officer!  Why, apples ain't even in sea—oh, yes, of course, I see.  Come on in then ...

Indeed.  (Although I'm not quite _singing_, nor would you want me to.)
