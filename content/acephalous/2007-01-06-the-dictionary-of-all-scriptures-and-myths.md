## The Dictionary of All Scriptures and Myths

No more laughing at [Casaubon's hubris](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0517527634/diesekoschmar-20)—as of today, the necessity of his failure loses its necessariness.  But for his untimely demise, he could have succeeded, as G.A. Gaskell's [_Dictionary of All Scriptures and Myths_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0517527634/diesekoschmar-20) demonstrates.  From the dust jacket:

This classic reference guide to more than 5000 words and phrases of the Sacred Language is now available for the many thousands who have been searching for a complete, authoritative dictionary on the symbolism and terms of world religions.

Every Scripture and every Myth is defined with a clarity that defies misunderstanding.  And perhaps even more important, here for the first time is a dictionary that treats the definition of the Scriptures according to the intentions of the original writers.

Nowhere else can you find a book that deals as broadly and as completely with religious concepts as literature.  And for each term, the DICTIONARY OF ALL SCRIPTURES AND MYTHS brings you:

*   _Clear explanations of the symbolism of ancient and modern religious words and phrases_
*   _Numerous quotations from authoritative sources_
*   _Thoughtful descriptions of the meaning of the terms and how they are used in Myths and Scriptures_
*   _Complete cross reference_

The discovery of a metaphorical language underlying all sacred Scriptures of the world prompted Mr. Gaskell to write this dictionary which gives a more complete knowledge of man's inner nature and the purpose of his life on earth than was heretofore possible.

For the first time ever, I resisted the urge to interleave complete, authoritative Sarcasm into the body of the quotation.  Nowhere else will I defy my inner nature and the purpose of my life with such complete Restraint than in this authoritative post.  Why?

Its (many) problematic assumptions aside, Gaskell's compendium of [COMPLETE WORLD KNOWLEDGE](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594482225/diesekoschmar-20) oozes erudition.  The dust jacket again:
For instance under the phrase "Image of God," Mr. Gaskell quotes from the Bible, T. Aquinas, Harnack's _History of Dogma_, G.T. Ladd's _Philosophy of Religion_, C. Taylor's _Sayings of the Jewish Fathers_, and many more sources.

Reading
that list and pondering its many more sources—among them, A. Jukes, J.
Bunyan, G. Milmine, I. Myer and the illustrious M.B. Eddy—you wouldn't
particularly think this erudition would be all that much to fun to
acquire secondhand.  

You'd be wrong.

Absent from these descriptions is any hint of the joy to be derived
from the skimming of this tome.  All those literary scholars might be
completely wrong about the entertainment value of Casaubon's dessicated
monument to Christian syncretism.  To draw the comparison more
directly, Gaskell's readers will be entranced, Dorothea-like, not by
the material or the manner of its revelation, but by the
correspondences a mind overstuffed with information invariably
produces.  For example:
**DESERTS, VAST AND UNKNOWN :—**

**Symbolic of primordial chaos****—the infinite expanse of  
    formless matter.**

   
 "Pwan-koo is described as
appearing from the vast unknown deserts.  He was four times taller than
man, had horns on his head, and teeth protruding from his mouth."—Kidd,
_China_, p.100.

    The Logos proceeds from the Chaos or Depth.  The statement about
height, refers to the fact that the measure of a man, or ego,
comprehends the five planes of his being, upon four of which he has not
yet become fully conscious.  The "horns" symbolize victory: they are
the sign of the One who conquers the conditions of the planes.  The
"Lamb" or "Ram," "slain from the world's foundation," possesses the
same symbol.  The "teeth" symbolize power of expression,—the potential
becoming the actual,—the force of that which is uttered in the Divine
Fiat or Spoken Word.

    
_See_ ABYSS, CHAOS, DEEP, FANG, FOUR TIMES, HEAVEN AND EARTH, HEIGHT (OSIRIS), HORNS, LAMB OF GOD, MEASURE, PWANKOO, STEM, TEETH, TUSK

"Deserts, Vast and Unknown" brims over with what Gaskell calls
"undermeanings."  Without them, the universality his dictionary reveals
to have been revealed would evaporate.  It is these "undermeanings"
that prove him to be, as Dorothea said of Casaubon, "a man whose
learning almost amounted to a proof of whatever he believed."  

(_To be continued..._)

Well, yeah, a man's reach should definitely exceed his grasp, and I'm temperamentally attracted to the _idea_ of ambitious summas of all kinds. Accordingly, I find myself drawn to Gaskell's hypertrophic panopticism (as he might say). Alas, God (or the devil) is always in the details, and while watching someone making these bold speculative connections is fun for a time, the connections are never, in the root sense, _necessary_, i.e., you could replace them with another equally plausible set of connections. After a while the whole Big-Picture thing just strikes me as an exercise in misplaced ingenuity, rather like passing gas through a keyhole. Or as Dr. Johnson said in another context, "It is not done well, but you are surprised to find it done at all."

That book sounds like a lot of fun.  I wonder if you might class Graves' _The White Goddess_ in the same genre.

Didn't Mircea Eliade already definitively achieve this?
