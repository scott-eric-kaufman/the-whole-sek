## I'm Sorry, but Please, Blame Feedburner; also, a General RSS Query

Earlier this afternoon, I turned off Feedburner's del.icio.us links feed.  I'm not even sure how I'd turned it on, actually, but I'd noticed that whenever I added something to del.icio.us it ended up in my feed.  So I figured out how to turn it off and did.  Then—like [Judd Nelson](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000A98ZP/diesekoschmar-20) before the credits sapped the power from his fist of symbolic rebellion—Feedburner re-sent every del.icio.us link I'd ever saved.  So, sorry for cluttering your RSS readers with junk you didn't want (and I didn't want to send) in the first place.  Won't happen again.

Also, what do you think of the "preview" function on  Feedburner?  It looks cleaner in my RSS reader, but if you prefer being able to read the entire post, I can switch back.  After all, I don't need to read my feed ...
