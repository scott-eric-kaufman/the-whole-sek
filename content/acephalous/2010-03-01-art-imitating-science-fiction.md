Via [Warren Ellis](http://ubergrid.tumblr.com/post/331406251/wurzeltod-metamorphose-by-frederic-fontenoy), Frederic Fontenoy's _Metamorphose_, a series of photographs that come disturbingly close to approximating what Octavia Butler's Clayarks (the human-headed quadrupeds from [the Patternist novels](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446698903/diesekoschmar-20) who move with cat-like speed and agility) look like in motion:

Indeed. More [here](http://www.fredericfontenoy.com/Site/Metamorphose.html). Reminds me of Bill Brandt, though he didn't push it to quite this science-fictional extent.

You're not kidding, Vance.  [I mean](http://www.fredericfontenoy.com/Site/Metamorphose\_files/00029ok.jpg), [seriously](http://www.fredericfontenoy.com/Site/Metamorphose\_files/00012ok.jpg), [Jesus Christ](http://www.fredericfontenoy.com/Site/Metamorphose\_files/00011ok.jpg).

The technique may be [slit-scan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slit-scan\_photography) photography, an intentional application of the shutter effect seen e.g. in [this Lartigue shot](http://www.cracow-life.com/poland/jacques-henri-lartigue).

Vance, thanks for that link: I'd never heard of slit-scan technique before, but it's apparently used quite frequently.

_Reminds me of Francis Bacon..._

...which would be why I find it so compelling, given my love of Bacon.  (Speaking of which, apparently I never posted that really piece I wrote about Bacon; moreover, I can't find it in my draft folder either, so maybe I never wrote, but only thought about writing it?  Good Christ, but I'm an idiot sometimes.)

You can ROOOAAAARR! all you like, becausre you're apparently plenty intimidating.  I had someone post a comment to the effect of "Holy shit, Adam Roberts posted a comment on a blog by some random bloke on the internet, I could never write if I knew he was reading it," then _immediately_ email asking to delete it, on account of he it could be misconstrued to be insulting to me, when all he meant is that he was surprised/scared to find you here.

Adam doesn't scare me. But then I haven't read any of his books. ... _(begins to get nervous)_ ... Yet! I mean, I haven't read them yet.
