[_cross-posted to [The Valve](http://www.thevalve.org/go/)_]

Two long posts, both concerning theory, both beginning with a
quotation of a previous discussion.  Serendipity?  The constitutional
inability to resist having the last word?  Doesn’t matter.  Also
unimportant: the experiment I concocted whereby I would post this here
and ask Mark to post it on [Long Sunday](http://www.long-sunday.net/)
to see whether the two crowds would treat the material differently in
some meaningful way.  But I digress.  (Despite not even having started
yet.) Ahem: [I accused](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/political\_spirituality/#4230) Mark Kaplan of reading [Foucault’s account of historical interest](http://www.long-sunday.net/long\_sunday/2005/06/foucault\_and\_ir.html) naively.  I quoted this bit as proof:

So, for example, the sexual practices of ancient Greece –
were these not, for Foucault, partly a way of thinking his way outside
modern notions of ‘sexuality’ and the historically ingrained ‘regime’
supporting them.

And followed with this assessment:

I think Mark’s severely underestimating Foucault’s
congenital pessimism, both about historical change and, more
importantly, the idea that we can understand the discourses which
saturate our lives in the moment that we live them.

He responded, quite rightly, that I glossed over Foucault’s notion of
“the critical ontology of the self,” the practice he identifies with
Kant’s _Aufklärung_, which my _Oxford Duden German Dictionary_
tells me means something along the lines of “clearing up,” “solution,”
“elucidation,” “explanation,” “a reconnaissance plane” or “the
Enlightentment.” Some of these things are not like the others.  I’ve
wondered why the English translation of the essay—"What is
Enlightenment?"—failed to capture the reference there both in Kant’s
German ("_Was ist Aufklärung?_") and Foucault’s French ("_Qu’est-ce que les Lumières?_"). 
Might this slight tick in the English be indicative of some abstractive
impulse at the heart of Anglo-American Theory?  (Yes, I _capitalized_
it, but for reasons which will eventually become apparent.) I’m not too
inclined (yet) to attribute such a thing to American Theory because
Kant’s work, as well as Foucault’s gloss of it, speaks directly to the
problem of philosophical thought reflecting on the present moment:

				I have been seeking, on the one hand, to emphasize the
extent to which a type of philosophical interrogation—one that
simultaneously problematizes man’s relation to the present, man’s
historical mode of being, and the constitution of the self as an
autonomous subject—is rooted in the Enlightenment. On the other hand, I
have been seeking to stress that the thread that may connect us with
the Enlightenment is not faithfulness to doctrinal elements, but rather
the permanent reactivation of an attitude—that is, of a philosophical
ethos that could be described as a permanent critique of our historical
era.

This permanent critique of our historical era should entail “the
analysis of ourselves as beings who are historically determined, _to a certain extent_, by the Enlightenment” and “‘the contemporary limits of the necessary,’” _i.e._ “what is _not or is no longer_
indispensible for the constitution of ourselves as autonomous
subjects.” All that emphasis are belong to us.  We, er, I’ve empahsized
those passages not because I’m being excessively pedantic about hedging
key philosophical claims: I’ve emphasized them because in the process
of declaring the need for a new philosophical project Foucault
qualifies away the most contested elements of his early thought: the
extent to which any _individual_ discourse factors into the
formation of autonomous subjects.  I’ll return to this momentarily, but
first let me touch his distinction between “the Enlightenment” and
“Humanism.”

The first is a complex historical event.  The second is the “_theme or set of themes_
that have reappeared on several occasions over time in European
societies; these themes, always tied to value judgments, have obviously
_varied greatly in their content as well as in the values they have preserved_.”
Again, Foucault qualifies at the very moment his argument demands
clarification.  (Or a reconnaisance plane.) Humanism sounds like a
Foucauldian discoure: it is both Christian _and_ opposes Christianity; hostile and critical towards scientific inquiry _and_
supportive and optimistic of it.  Humanism has been present, he argues
by dint of list, in Marxism, existentialism, personalism, National
Socialism and Stalinism.  And the Enlightenment, of course.  But even
though he easily identifies all the places in which it has been
present, he lists none of its definitive characteristics, none of the
ways in which it informed any of these larger movements in which it was
a “theme or set of themes.” _Not even in the Enlightenment:_ “An
analysis of their complex relations in the course of the last two
centuries would be a worthwhile project an important one if we are to
bring _some measure_ of clarity to the consciousness that we have of ourselves and of our past.”

Foucault’s assertions here align perfectly with Mark’s claim about it:
at this late stage of his career, Foucault’s invested in a “critical
ontology of the self” which will “not seek to identify the universal
structures of all knowledge or of all possible moral action, but will
seek to treat the instances of discourse that articulate what we think,
say, and do as so many historical events.” This project applies the
“archeological” method Foucault earlier established to what I’ll call
“the historical present.” Are there limits to our ability to assess the
historical present the same way we assess the historical past?  Of
course there are: “This philosophical ethos may be characterized as a
limit-attitude.” The inability of an individual to identify precisely
the discourses of which he or she is constituted would put a damper on
this whole endeavour.  But Foucault anticipates this criticism (born,
as it is, from his own thought):

To this, two responses. It is true that we have to give up
hope of ever acceding to a point of view that could give us access to
any complete and definitive knowledge of what may constitute our
historical limits. And from this point of view the theoretical and
practical experience that we have of our limits and of _the possibility of moving beyond them_ is _always limited and determined_; thus we are always in the position of beginning again.

Here again Foucault the Elder bucks against Foucault the Younger,
claiming that the best we can muster is an infinite “beginning again.”
We cannot transcend our limits, or even ever be fully cognizant of
them.  Therefore, even if we try to transcend them, not only would we
never be entirely sure what it is we’d be trying to transcend; we’d be
damn sure (according to Foucault) that we wouldn’t be able to do
anything even if we did.  Foucault the Younger understands the
implications of his own thoughts.  Foucault the Elder plasters over
these pessimisms by saying, “Well, we should have this limit-attitude,
yes, and we should be aware of the futility of our project, alright,
and if we do this we can overcome what it is I just now said we can
never overcome, understand?” (In this vein I understand his attraction
to _Anti-Oedipus:_
Deleuze & Guattari explode the piñata and admire the falling
confetti and, um, then they’re all liberated, see?) In other words, the
way I read Foucault the Elder has been determined by my understanding
of Foucault the Younger.  

But before I proceed—John’s an inspiration—I need you to know there are
a few things I’m absolutely, positively not doing: first, I’m not
denigrating Foucault’s life-long commitment to the ideals of leftist
intellectual dissidents, nor am I suggesting that his public political
commitments were in any way insincere; second, I’m not saying that
Foucault didn’t believe there to be an integral relation between his
scholarship and “the real world” or what-not, as anyone who has glanced
as his bibliography—_Madness and Civilization_, _Pierre Riviere_, _The Birth of the Clinic_, and _Discipline and Punish_
were nothing if not the work of a scholar with a social conscience and
a deeply ingrained desire not to speak to it.  That said, the
implications of his own work point to the futility of such
interventions, _especially political ones_.  I’ll post “Part II”
of this as soon as I write it.  It will outline why Foucault the
Younger would’ve laughed at Foucault the Elder and discuss how one
particular group of scholars, the self-proclaimed New Historicists,
sought to overcome the deterministic bent of Foucauldian thought.  

[Couple of last thoughts: This may be a bat-shit account of Foucault. 
If it is, call me out on it.  I’ve only ever read him for my own
edification, so there’s a chance I might be coloring outside the
lines.  Second: I reserve the right to edit this up the Great Chain if
it is bat-shit.  Who knows which higher mammal it’ll be come tomorrow
morn.  Stay tuned!]
