## Obama's Delegates Count, Admit Clinton Staffers

CHAPPAQUA, NEW YORK — Late Wednesday night Clinton insiders acknowledged her campaign had changed tack and decided the delegates Obama has won do actually [matter](http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/2/11/121758/950/294/454307).  According to one source, Clinton is willing to concede that the states whose delegates are bound to Obama should be counted.  

"The way I see it," confessed one senior Clinton campaign adviser, "it would be political suicide for her to deny Obama's delegates their rightful seats at the convention.  She'll let them sit."

However, other sources within the Clinton camp acknowledge that in addition to trying to seat Michigan and Florida delegates, senior staffers have launched a brazen and fundamental challenge to the legitimacy of Obama's delegates.  

Speaking on the condition of anonymity, one staffer admitted, "We all want all the delegates to count, but only in the right and proper proportion.  Hillary's a phenomenal candidate and white.  Obama's also compelling.  We simply want to make sure the numbers match the voters' true and earnest opinions."

To this end, senior Clinton advisers demanded that, in addition to seating Michigan and Florida delegates, those delegates who pledged their support to Obama have all three-fifths of their vote counted.

"We are and remain committed to counting three-fifths of all of Obama's pledged and super-delegates," said Clinton at a rally in Ohio.  "No vote should be uncounted, no matter how fractional."

Damn! This one had me going through the scroll-down! I predict troubles coming out of this one (it's February; mercury's in retrograde; it's time for SEK to start a big internet dustup again.)

Ooooph.  I wasn't ready for the three-fifths part.  Well done.

Sisyphus, you had me afraid to turn on the internet this morning ... fortunately, I buried my lede so deep most people didn't stick around for it.  Ha!  (On me, since I want people to think I'm funny.)

Well, maybe by predicting it I made it not happen; it always works when I comment on the weather, for example.

So the implication here is that the first wifely wo(begone)-medievalist who comes along and clicks the "sincere fool" link--the one who leaves the first mis-placed comment after the post has been made--is the most sincere of fools, right? (Why do I feel as if I've just been thrown into a looking-glass ass-backward, proudly Probama, yet wondering if there is a "just keep scrolling" button?!?)
