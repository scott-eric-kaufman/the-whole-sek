## Professional Bedrooms

Ogged [linked](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week\_2007\_07\_01.html) to [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/sports/01cage.html?ex=1341028800&en=e5292f3a8d589ae2&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink) _New York Times_ article about the unusual living arrangements of the Angels' Reggie Willits:

[![01cage1600](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/01/01cage1600.jpg "01cage1600")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/01/01cage1600.jpg)

I initially [defended](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/comments\_7074.html#578244) Willits' decision to transform his bedroom into a batting cage on the grounds that it allows him to spend more time with his spouse than the average professional athlete.  When the thread turned to divorce rates in academia, I discovered the actual reason for my defense.

Here's my desk:

[![The\_desk](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/01/the\_desk.jpg "The\_desk")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/01/the\_desk.jpg)

Here's the bookshelf to my left:

[![Work\_area\_2](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/01/work\_area\_2.jpg "Work\_area\_2")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/01/work\_area\_2.jpg)

There's another bookshelf behind me, still another to my right.  Yet
were I to turn around, like as not I'd see something like this:

[![Bed](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/01/bed.jpg "Bed")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/01/bed.jpg)

Because my office is conveniently located in my bedroom.  The
Willits' arrangement seems natural because professional athletes share
academics' engulfing commitment to their trade.  A batting cage in the
bedroom is no different than an office, inasmuch as both reflect how
all-consuming both careers are.  That said, in a perfect world, I'd
have both__a batting cage _and_ an office in my bedroom, what with the former being my preferred means of relieving the stress produced in the latter.

If only that were modified into a [golf net and putting area](http://mlyhlss.blogspot.com/2007/06/take-your-blog-to-course-us-womens-open.html), you'd have my dream office....

Mmmm, look, bookshelves! Delicious. 

What's wrong with having, you know, separate rooms for separate stuff? At least you could have the batting cage/office/putting green out in the _living room,_ leaving the bedroom free for its true purpose:

watching Tivo'd episodes of The Wire.

 Er, having to pay for them?

You own the _Chicago Manual of Style_ in hardback?  And you keep it hard by your computer?   Hummmm, hooom.

Actually, that could be a new tag: 'which book is nearest, as the crow flies (or flying bookworm moves) to your computer _right now_?'  In my case it's an old paperback copy of  [Hobson-Jobson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobson-Jobson) that I happen to own, because I've just been writing a story set in India in 1910 and wanted to look a few things up.  I couldn't say that Hobson-Jobson is usually the book closest to my computer.

... though I look again at the photo above and see that it's not the _Chicago Manual of Style IN HARDBACK_ that's nearest to your computer, but that dark hbk at right angles to the machine.  I take it to be _The MHRA Style Manual IN HARDBACK_, or perhaps _The MLA Style Manual IN HARDBACK_.

Sisyphus, Dave's correct.  I'd love to have a separate room for everything but, you know, am still a graduate student.  That said, I _like_ having my office in my bedroom.  Facilitates napping.

Adam, the book closest to my machine's Kim Stanley Robinson's _The Years of Rice and Salt_, but that's not because I'm reading it.  It's the perfect height to place the book I'm actually working on atop -- you know, so it stays open without breaking its spine.  And doesn't _everyone_ have _Chicago_ in hardback?\*

\*No, probably not.  I keep it close because I'm anal retentive about citation formating; and yes, I use _Chicago_ instead of _MLA_, because I think it's more elegant.

Ahhh/Awww,  

You're trying to win Style points with us historians.

I'm very proud of myself--I just took all of the books _out_ of the bedroom.

Of course, they're just about everywhere else in the house.  Still in boxes, unfortunately.

There's a big stack of books next to the desk, but the one closest to the computer is _Lectures Delivered Before the Young Men's Christian Association, 1848-49_.  Thrilling reading, I know.

 _That said, in a perfect world,_ 

So you'd have a perfect world, and a whole freaking  _batting cage,_ and you wouldn't also dream up the money for a mansion, or at least a house with some spare rooms and a bowling alley in the basement?

Interesting. 

I'd have a Sherlock-Holmes style Edwardian library. Mmm. Lots of mahogany, club chairs by a fire, maybe even a butler. 

Or a moat. Either or.
