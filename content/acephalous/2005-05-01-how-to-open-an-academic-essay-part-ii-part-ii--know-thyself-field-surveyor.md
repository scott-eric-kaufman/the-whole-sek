In considering the relationship between the introductory paragraph of an academic essay and the logic of the argument that follows--and I _am_ asserting that such a relationship exists and that, therefore, some combinations of intro. and argument are more felicitous than others--I think it might be instructive to think about how the introductions I've written affect the material which follows them.  To continue yesterday's inadequate analysis of the State of the Field intro., I dip into my archives and produce one of the approximately 17,491 introductory paragraphs I've written for the first chapter of my dissertation.  Comments on its shortcomings follow:
In his [review](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern\_fiction\_studies/v051/51.1clymer.html) of three recent books
on American literary naturalism in the latest _Modern Fiction Studies_, Jeffory Clymer wonders whether “the
withdrawal from organizing interpretations around naturalism per se
may…represent a critical exhaustion with reconciling the genre’s
inconsistencies.”[](#\_ftn1) These inconsistencies, Clymer argues,
undermine “certain strands of Foucauldian New Historicism” by “demonstrating
how brittle, monolithic, and ultimately unrevealing [they] can be.”[](#\_ftn2) The brittle quality of these monolithic
accounts of naturalism result, Clymer implies, from the genre’s foundational
inconsistency: its desire to depict a deterministic world in which the
individual is governed by nature and its frequent, didactic appeals to
individualism and human freedom. From a
philosophical perspective, as John Conder ably demonstrated in _Naturalism in American Fiction: The Classic
Phase_ (1984), pessimistic determinism and an optimistic belief in free will
and the possibility of moral improvement are reconcilable positions. Employing Hobbes’ notion that freedom works
within inscribed terms and Bergson’s notion of a durational self, Conder
reconciles determinism and individualism by arguing that the former produces
the latter. Though philosophically
sound, Conder’s argument relies on individual Americans naturalists developing _in toto_ theories that would catapult
Bergson to international celebrity when they were first published in 1907. In this dissertation I will focus on the
theories of human and social development available to American literary
naturalists at the time they were writing. Produced by the “evolution vogue” following the publication of _On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural
Selection_ (1859), these models embraced or refused Darwin’s advances with wildly different
degrees of enthusiasm or opprobrium. Over the next 50 years, these systems would develop in an echo chamber,
the cacophony of each contributing to the cacophony of the whole. Deafened by too many incompatible
propositions voiced so intelligently and authoritatively, _fin de siècle_ authors cherry-picked individual propositions from
larger theoretical schemes. Each author
created his or her own idiosyncratic combination of essentialist, determinist,
individualist and developmental principles drawn from the representative set of
evolutionary concerns. The necessarily
idiosyncratic nature of these selections, as well as their rationale, has been
obscured by the presentism of the historians and historians of science whose
work granted literary scholars access to the Gilded Age and Progressive Era’s
intellectual milieu.

This introduction, like Dawes', opens with a subtle assertion about the timeliness of the article to follow.  Weathered hat in humble hands, eyes sounding the floor for evidence of structural uncomformities, this intro. says, nay, shucks "Smart people like Jeffory Clymer are publishing about the problems I address in important academic journals like _Modern Fiction Studies_."  Then, with a boldness born of short summary, it raises its eyes, puffs its chest and says "But even smart people publishing in important journals sometimes miss The Big Picture."  Clymer is correct, I claim, only insofar....  I count Only Insofar kin to the State of the Field.  Because the State of the Field implies that the critics and scholars who've traversed the Field before you are correct Only Insofar as the contingencies on which your argument stakes it claim have been ignored.  But not all State of the Field introductions employ the Only Insofar logic.  

Another popular variation is Kill All Fathers, in which you survey the State of the Field, find its current inhabitants unfit to waste the air you breath and start a conflagration.  Your readers are reminded of Dresden in '45 or Cambodia in '69, '70, and pretty much the rest Nixon Administration.  They witness this orgy of intellectual genocide and then find it difficult to take you very seriously.  In the following, the introductory paragraph strangles some fathers.  The footnote desecrates their graves.  To wit:  
The development of the evolutionary “modern synthesis” and the preeminence of Richard Hofstadter’s _Social Darwinism in American Thought_ (1944) have combined to frustrate attempts to assess the impact of evolutionary theory on American political and social thought in the first decade of the 20
th
 century. Because Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and George Simpson incorporated Darwin’s mechanism of speciation into the “modern synthesis”—the synthesis of Darwin’s theory of natural selection and Gregor Mendel’s theory of genetic inheritance—the social and political theories of evolutionary thinkers who challenged Darwin have largely been forgotten. Following Hofstadter, generations of social and literary historians have discussed social Darwinism as if it were the only application of evolutionary thought to social policy popular between 1890 and 1910. It wasn’t.\*  
-----  
\* I am not alone in my reevaluation of the effect Darwinism had on American politics. Many historians have taken issue with Richard Hofstadter’s claim, in _Social Darwinism in American Thought_ (1944), that social Darwinism dominated the manifestations of Darwinian thought in American politics. In _Social Darwinism: Science and Myth in Anglo-American Social Thought_ (1979), Robert Bannister argues that social Darwinists were not nearly
as prominent as reform Darwinists, among whom he numbers Oliver Wendell
Holmes, who “argued that evolutionary theory supported combination and
group solidarity over individualism” (11). Following John Dewey,
Bannister claims that classical liberals “rarely laced their prose with
appeals to Darwinism …. Rather, they were suspicious if not downright
frightened by the implications of the new theory. Such was even the
case with Herbert Spencer and his American disciples—the stereotypical
textbook social Darwinists—whose world view remained essentially
pre-Darwinian” (1). Furthermore, “New Liberals, socialists, and other
advocates of positive government appealed openly and with far greater
regularity to Darwinism to support their causes” (1). See also Donald
Bellomy, “Social Darwinism Revisted,” (Philadelphia, 1978); Burton J.
Bledstein, _Perspectives in American History_ 1 (1984): 1-129; Hamilton Cravens, _The Triumph of Evolution__The Culture of Professionalism_ (New York, 1976).

Here I present the State of the Field as roughly equivalent to the current State of the Union.  This seems like an effective way to "intervene in a critical discourse."  After all, attacking the inadequacies of All Fathers clear-cuts a swath of territory in which your argument can range free.  Unfortunately, this development enrages All Fathers, and they respond with protestations of your inadequate schooling, your relative inexperience and your attitude.  As often as not, these protestations hit home.  This is because Killing All Fathers occurs during the earliest stages of intellectual development--speaking both generally and as regards particular projects--and should be avoided unless you want to communicate your intellectual immaturity to the profession at large.  True to form, I stole this intro. from the file "dissertation 1.0."  That would be the first draft I ever wrote of my initial dissertation chapter.  The example of Only Insofar above comes from "dissertation 1.38."  That would be the 38th draft of my first chapter.  The 36 interim drafts occupied my energies for the better part of a year.  A year in which I researched tirelessly; learned what I had only assumed and unlearned what I had assumed incorrectly; and, in a manner of speaking, stopped being a critic and started being a scholar.

I should add that I still think I'm right and Hofstadter wrong. Only I now know that can be communicated without debasing his intellectual legacy.  Over the course of the dissertation I will demonstrate with careful arguments, calculated gambles and a wealth of archival material that Hofstadter's thesis is correct, you guessed it, _only insofar..._

I think you're right and Hofstadter is wrong too.  Bannister's book was a real eye opener for me.  I think your dissertation topic is a great one, too, btw.  Am eager to see the results.
