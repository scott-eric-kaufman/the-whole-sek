## Everyone Reads Nietzsche Now; or, You Think I'm Antitheoretical?

[Adam](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2005/09/reservations.html) wants to know what Nietzsche argued.  I want to know how Americans mangled his thought during the "Nietzsche vogue" of 1897-1908.  (Those dates aren't as random as they seem, but I lack sufficient energy to justify my bracketing.)  A Polaroid of this fissure between intellectuals (like Adam) and intellectual historians (like Yours Truly) looks something like this: intellectuals are more interested in the causes than their effects, whereas intellectual historians are more interested in the effects than their causes.  So how _did_ Americans mangle Nietzsche during his very own vogue?  Arthur Allin's review of Alexander Tille's _Von Nietzsche bis Darwin_ (1897) in _The Journal of American Psychology_ neatly captures both the common misinterpretations and the shrill tone with which they were voiced:

Nietzsche, the erratic, the eccentric, the
aphoristic and the modern oracular Zarathurstrian, is for [Tille] the
high-water mark of the tide which has been rising so steadily since Darwin’s days. Spencer, Leslie Stephen, Wundt, Huxley,
Fiske, Williams, Bebel and others are shown to be so many landscapes on the
road to Nietzsche. The trend of thought
is, of course, biological and evolutionary. The _Abermensch_, the
Beyond-Man, is the continued goal. A
race of laughing lions is coming, strong men full of deeds and vigor. The cry is not Repent! but the true Metanoia,
change of life and conduct; not so much humility and penance, as Grecian valor
and Roman _virtus_. A high aristocratic _Herrenclasse_, the product of natural selection is his ideal. Consumptives must not marry. Only the fittest must survive.

I do see "evolutionary" elements in Nietzsche's thought, but they are more Lamarckian than Darwinian.  Which is to say -- surprisingly, based on your account, it would appear that the earliest American interpreters of Nietzsche managed to misunderstand a complex German thinker whose works were available only in shitty translations and whose sister (and literary executor) was systematically misrepresenting his ideas.

could you perhaps explain a little how nietzsche was closer to lamarck than darwin (other than the explicit remark in gay science against schopenhaur's discredit of the former - p114 in kaufmann)? does this 'hegelian' split dismiss (in fact defend) nietzsche in one of his 'racist' moods? does nietzsche himself not maintain this tension-thought between, say, ontogeny and phylogeny, refusing to synthesize?

Actually, the will to power is not in accord with an evolutionist view of the world at all; Nietzsche not only criticizes Darwin’s theory for being an “incomprehensibly one-sided doctrine” (TGS 349) but refutes it. The world is not advancing, ages and epochs have not become stronger, but weaker. In Twilight of the Idols, the Renaissance is seen as the last great age, an age that was strong, noble and prodigal; out of such positive forces, it created great values. The modern age in contrast is weaker, decadent, and pitiable; out of such negative forces, it created pitiable virtues. In aphorism 349 from TGS, he states further that the “struggle for existence is only an exception, a temporary restriction of the will to life. The great and small struggle always revolves around superiority, around growth and expansion, around power – in accordance with the will to power which is the will of life.” 

A similar critique is made years later in Twilight of the Idols in section 14 of Skirmishes of an Untimely Man, “Anti-Darwin”: “Supposing, however, that this struggle exists – and it does indeed occur – its outcome is the reverse of that desired by the school of Darwin, of that which one ought perhaps to desire with them: namely, the defeat of the stronger, the more privileged, the fortunate exceptions. Species do not grow more perfect: the weaker dominate the strong again and again – the reason being they are the great majority, and they are also cleverer. . .”

And in On the Genealogy of Morals he notes that “one should not overlook this fact: the strong are naturally inclined to separate as the weak are to congregate; if the former unite together, it is only with the aim of an aggressive collective action and collective satisfaction of their will to power, and with much resistance from the individual conscience; the latter, on the contrary, enjoy precisely this coming together – their instinct is just as much satisfied by this as the instinct of the born “masters” . . . is fundamentally irritated and disquieted by such organization” (3, 18).

Those Nietzsche defined as most weak, the priestly caste and their ilk, are precisely those who overpowered and defeated the nobles, those he defined as the strongest, most admirable, or, to use Darwin’s terminology, “the fittest”. So, it is hardly the “fittest” who survive in this world, but the most “clever” – the “fittest” actually perish more readily as such ages like the Renaissance reveal, for weaker ages, like ours, not stronger, follow after. 

To exercise the will to power one doesn’t have to be one of the “fittest”; the will to power is something Nietzsche sees as a basic human function which everyone exercises – the ‘slave’ just as the ‘master’ exercises will to power, but in distinctly different ways. How one exercises one’s power is of vital importance for Nietzsche; despite common misconceptions, he does not advocate cruelty or the exertion of force over those who are weaker – observations are often mistaken for principles which Nietzsche advocates. The concept of agon (or contest) which he developed from the Greeks calls for ‘fighting’ only with one’s equals – no honest and self-respecting nobleman, knight, or sportsman would experience joy or feel stronger through defeating a weaker opponent; they would find it embarrassing and pathetic. In fact, Nietzsche finds the act of tyranny or exercising force over others a sign of a lack of power: “the state in which we hurt others is rarely as agreeable, in an unadulterated way, as that in which we benefit others; it is a sign that we are still lacking power, or it shows a sense of frustration in the face of this poverty; it is accompanied by new dangers and uncertainties for what power we do possess, and clouds our horizon with the prospect of revenge, scorn, punishment, and failure” (TGS, 13). 

It is precisely such feelings Nietzsche wants humans to overcome, for only through moving beyond the desire for revenge, which he calls the bridge to the highest hope (the movement beyond), will man overcome what is worst in himself, what is human, all-too-human, and move closer towards that which is greatest in himself, to the Overhuman to use Graham Parkes’ new, more accurate translation of Ubermensch. “Beauty” Zarathustra declares, “is unattainable to all violent wills” (TSZ, “Of the Sublime Men”), and, in one sense, what Nietzsche desires is that men make themselves ‘beautiful’, that they make art works of their lives and of the world. . .
