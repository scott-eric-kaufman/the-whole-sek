## Thirteen Things One Ought Not To Do On A Final Paper

1.  Turn in two pages of clearly deficient work and eight blank ones in order to establish the basis for your change-of-grade appeal.
2.  Definitively prove that you've attended a grand total of three classes by writing the single most wrong-headed paragraph I've ever read.
3.  Decide that "seven to ten pages" means "four unfathomably foul ones."
4.  Pretend to have read what was required of you while admonishing [Janet Malcolm](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679731830/diesekoschmar-20) for criticizing Truman Capote's [_In Cold Blood_] (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679745653/diesekoschmar-20) in her book about Joe McGinnis' [_Fatal Vision_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0451165667)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1)
5.  Cite a blurb from the back cover of [_The Perfect Storm_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060977477/diesekoschmar-20).
6.  Misattribute it to the author.
7.  Misspell the author's name.
8.  And the title of the book.
9.  And the word "and."
10.   As "nads."
11.  Neglected to have been written your essay in English which resembling language.12.  Not bothering to be edited what you turn up to a instructor that will graded your papers.
13.  Beg me to award you an "A" despite having committed seven of the aforementioned unmentionables.

No actual students were harmed in the mocking of this post.  Any resemblence to students alive, dead or dead drunk in some shameful  Panama City hovel  is either stated or implied.

I say ask not what one ought do, but what one ought _to_ do.

I should add that I personally post things an average of seven times before I've weeded out all my typos and the like, if I ever do. But I am blessed to have no readership.

Plausible deniability _is_ a wonderful thing, but I just punted that.  I do, however, have an _excuse_:

Contamination.

Hey, cut the kid some slack.  It was final's week, after all.  Actually, what's most alarming is not the ignorance with which it seems the paper was written, but the nerve it obviously took to hand something like that in and expect a letter grade.  It seems he/she shouldn't have even turned anything in.

Zach, if I were you, I'd wouldn't be sympathizing so much as _begging_ . . . that I don't punk _you_ with one of _their_ grades.  

'Cause you know I will . . . _just to see you cry_.

Do you recall Zach's A- incident from last quarter Scott?  I would strongly suggest there be no 'punking' of his grades.  Firmly advise even.

Two words: Instruction Manuals.  I don't mean to scare you, but some instruction manuals are written by individuals who primarily speak English.  Hmmm...Perhaps your mystery author has a goal in sight.

The thing that keeps startling me are the students who are - as far as I can tell, sincerely - shocked that I'm giving them a low grade.  I always find this unnerving, because it implies that they are turning in similar work for other classes, and \*not\* receiving low grades for it.

**Things one ought not to do as a salaried academic**: submit a proposal to Routledge presenting oneself as ideally based to write a student-oriented introductory study of the work and thought of Fredric Jameson, for their 'Routledge Critical Thinkers' series, in which the name of the chap _is spelled incorrectly_.  'Frederick'.  Right there at the top of the proposal.  I mean, undergraduates have their excuses, in this TV-saturated txt-mssging culture.  But I was a full-time professional academic.  I'd been reading Jameson for many many years, in detail, with lots of scribbly marginalia and everything.  And yet I'd never in all that time _clocked the way the guy's first name was spelled._

Jinkies, for all _I_ know, it's been 'Skot Gerald Kaufman' all along, and I've just ... you know ... assumed ...

In the category of "additions to the list":

It also seems to a bad idea to submit a paper heavily plagiarized with material from a sample paper distributed by the instructor -- and indeed _written by the instructor_.

In the category of "embarrassing things I've submitted (though as an undergrad and not to Routledge)":

One should not misspell **_one's own name_**; or as my professor remarked, it was, at the very least, "an inauspicious beginning."

Though on a similar note: students have more than once had a hard time remembering whether my first name is Rodney or Robert. And of course consulting the syllabus is a bit too much work...

I had a student a couple years back who plagiarized her final paper by randomly and indiscriminately interweaving two articles we had read earlier that semester. Two articles we had read earlier that semester _on the same day_. Two articles we had read earlier that semester, on the same day, under the stipulation that they were arguing from _opposite sides_ of the debate. The result was a submission in which the body of the paper argued against both the thesis and the conclusion.

"presenting oneself as ideally based to write a student-oriented introductory study of the work...in which the name of the chap is spelled incorrectly. '"

Well that's exactly what we're talking about, right? That's where students are at. Anyway, it's a lazy editor who turns down and author because he or she needs editing.

I've had students misspell my name several times.  Not too cool.  I've also had a student submit a plagiarized paper with a different last name in the header.

Another reason the academic path is looking less and less likely for me: the grading.  What you guys have to read... \*shudder\*  As a born-proofread/editor, I think reading some of those essays would give me an aneurysm.  

I must say, though, that Mike's "I would add to this list: submit a paper with a receipt from essayrelief.com \*stapled\* to its final page." is my favorite.  I sincerely hope they didn't try to defend themselves against a plagiarism investigation.

No, BN, he did not attempt any sort of defense.  Iron clad incriminating evidence has a way of taking the wind out of a defendant's sails.

I would think you could go for the "absurdist joke" defense, along the lines of "If I were going to plagairize a paper, would I really leave a receipt stapled to it?  No, I just mocked up the receipt as a joke."  Then again, if you were fast on your feet enough to pull that one off, you wouldn't need to copy someone else's paper.

1. This doesn't have to do with misspelling names, but where I went to school there was one dept. that had both a Prof. Wolf and a Prof. Fox. It was not at all unusual for students to drop off their papers in the other prof.'s mailbox.

2. My roommate TA'd for the Dept. of Science, Tech. & Society-- known as "STS" for short.  Except by one student, who several times in an email referred to it as the "TITS" Dept.
