The worst cold I’ve ever had?  The one that left me perched before a roomful of students, [unable to make words](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/10/post.html)?  I shared it with the wife.  So she’s spent her favorite holiday curled up on the couch “watching” [her favorite holiday special](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0019KAQEU/diesekoschmar-20) when she’s ripped from sleep by hack, cough or [Sukhee Kang](http://www.sukheekangformayor.com/accompl.htm).  (_Four calls so far today_!)  Like all decent people and ([irate dinosaurs](http://www.qwantz.com/archive/000874.html)), she abhors the sexification of Halloween:

Because the only thing she loves more than me is [one-third of Europe dead](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/syllabus\_bleg\_p.html), I dedicate [this Google failure](http://images.google.com/images?um=1&hl=en&safe=off&q=%!s(MISSING)exy+plague+doctor%!&(MISSING)btnG=Search+Images) to her.  It’s comforting to know [some things](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Doktorschnabel\_430px.jpg) remain sacred.
