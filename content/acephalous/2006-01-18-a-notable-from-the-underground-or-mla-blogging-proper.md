## A Notable From the Underground; or, MLA-Blogging Proper

So deep tubs . . . depressing.  Forget I even mentioned them.  Because as I went about my browsing business tonight I checked out [Scott McLemee](http://www.mclemee.com/id4.html)'s [latest _Intellectual Affairs_ column](http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2006/01/18/mclemee) and found the following:
The next gathering, also for lunch, took place a week later, during the
convention of the Modern Language Association. Looking around the
table, I drew up a quick census. One guest worked on British novels of
the Victorian era. Another writes about contemporary postcolonial
fiction and poetry. We had two Americanists, but of somewhat different
specialist species; besides, one was a tenured professor, while the
other is just starting his dissertation. And, finally, there was, once
again, a philosopher. (Actually it was the same philosopher, visiting
from Singapore and in town for a while.)

Guess which one is me?  A few unnecessary hints: 

1.  I'm not a Victorianist.
2.  I don't work on postcolonial fiction and poetry.
3.  I'm not tenured.
4.  I don't live in Singapore.
5.  I'm an Americanist.

So which one am I?  And can you guess what kind of burrito-wrap-thingy I ordered?  I'll give you a hint: 

It's named after a character in _Clue_ who is himself named after a condiment.  

Am I mysterious or what?  (The answer's obviously "or what."  But read Scott's column.  It communicates more eloquently than I've been able to mustard the sense of immediate connection and community blogging fostered at the MLA this past December.)

I thought that you were going to be depressed over how you were described as "just starting" your dissertation.

Wait ... wait ... were you the Victorianist?

As the Victorianist in question, I can wholeheartedly testify to Scott's innocence.  Scott was _not_ in the library with a candlestick when the crime took place.

Rich, [Scott cleared that up](http://www.mclemee.com/id4.html):

That's because (1) he sometimes makes it sound like he's just getting started and (2) he is but a kid, or so it would seem to an incipient coot such as myself.

See?  It's because _I look so young_ that he assumed I must just be starting.  I'll take _that_ backhanded complement any day of the week.  Plus, I do always sound like I've just always started it, since, well, I don't feel I inhabit the material yet.  Plus, there's so much material that I'm always finding something or other I hadn't stumbled across before.  That said, I'll have it finished by the end of March, I tell you, _the end of March_.

Adam, as Miriam pointed out, I'm not the Victorianist, nor did I have the candlestick, rake or garden hose in the foyer or the conservatory.  That philosopher from Singapore, on the other hand . . .

Warmer, Adam, warmer . . . what are you, _Stoned_?  Wait, that's not until Monday.
