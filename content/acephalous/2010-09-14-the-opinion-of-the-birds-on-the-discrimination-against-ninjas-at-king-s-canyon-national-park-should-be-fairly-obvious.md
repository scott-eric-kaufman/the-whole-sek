Wow, someone really hates you.  It's weird because usually academicish blogs don't tend to attract this kind of trolling.

Scott, I think you left the spam filter off....

Guessing that the seven proxies comment is a [joke](http://encyclopediadramatica.com/7\_Proxies) from someone mocking the troll. If not, though, you should still be able to [backtrace it](http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/1cd2fbc0e7/because-i-back-traced-it-the-you-dun-goofed-up-remix).

Huh. I actually didn't know the origin of "I'm aware of ..." until now. Learn something new every day.

[Ain't it awesome](http://encyclopediadramatica.com/I\_am\_aware\_of\_all\_internet\_traditions)?  That said, the link to the original post and comment are broken.  I suppose I could fix it, though...
