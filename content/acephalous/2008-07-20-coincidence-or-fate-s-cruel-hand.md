## Coincidence or fate's cruel hand?

Of the [339 miles](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=&saddr=Kingwood,+TX&daddr=Kingston,+MS&sll=30.70324,-93.17143&sspn=2.158326,4.812012&doflg=ptm&ie=UTF8&z=8) and countless cities between Kingwood, Texas and Kingston, Mississippi, where should my car overheat and die?  Where else but in my hometown of Baton Rouge.  

On the one hand, breaking down within a few miles of my sister's apartment is convenient.  On the other—[for reasons alluded to in the eighth stanza](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/07/dear-university.html#comment-122778334)—the car suiciding here is suspicious and frightening.

If you don't hear from me within 48 hours, call the police and express vague concerns about the location of my spectacularly murdered corpse.

Good god.  I'd better start flipping through rhymezone.com or something.  Maybe write a stanza or two predictively.  What's a rhyme for decapitate?

He disappeared on his trip; they thought he was late,  

But his hometown buddies didn't think he's so great,  

His graduation will forever wait,  

You can't defend your diss as a decapitate

Yeah, it's clumsy using a verb as a noun and all.  But I'll have plenty of time to polish it up later.  Thanks for letting me chronicle your myth-story, Scott!  Of course, the chronicler in this case is not exactly Homer, but the chronicled is not exactly Odysseus, so perhaps it matches.

In all seriousness, though, that's too bad.  My sympathies.  And of course I don't think that foul play actually had anything to do with it, but having your car die is still bad.
