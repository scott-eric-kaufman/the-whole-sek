_(since many leftists are proudly “dropping out” again)_

Only eight words, but sooooo many layers of ideological baggage.

(First, nice to see you're still reading.  Haven't noticed you in my logs of late.  Then again, maybe I just drove you away again.)  That's certainly true, but we've had this conversation before, no?  I still think I'm doing what I think best, you still think you're doing what you think best; that said, in the context of that post, I think there's ample room for us to have that argument and still be happy about the outcome.  Maybe?  

By which I mean, I'm specifically saying that we should avoid the "get on the bus" mentality characteristic of so many proceduralists, _i.e._ that we ought to create a culture of dissent wherein we can accomplish short term goals while working toward long-term ones.

Around and around and around Scott goes,   

where he next stops, no one knows. 

:-) 

And if you keep it up with the Theory thing, my work Net Police will ban you. And that would be a bad thing.

I'm posting this here because I couldn't post it over at Slant Truth.  

_I’m sending all these not because I'm self-important (although, really, who am I kidding?) but because they're evidence that people don't actually want to discuss so much as they declaim.  Oh, and I would post the comments I left on the site which shall not be named, but I'm apparently not something enough for its proprietor, since not a single comment I've ever made has made it past the comment moderator.  I wish I could say it was an accident, or chalk it up to me being a pig, but at this point I can only say it must be something else.  Ugh.  I think I'm going to crawl into a shell for a while.  By the by, you may enjoy the links in tonight's post:[http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/you\_too\_you\_you.](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/you\_too\_you\_you.) html_

No, I didn't answer your questions (except for the ones I did, anyway).  

...Why?  Why are they an indication that people aren't interested in discussion?  Because they don't discuss something with you?  Because--as seems to be a statistical likelihood--they get tired of a non-conversation too early to give your comments the loving attention they deserve?  I don't think _I'm_ all that interested in discussing anything with you, not after this.  

Speaking just for myself here, I talk about these things all the time.  I tend to have much more interesting--and contentious--discussions off-blog, with people who've had similar experiences with stupid questions.  I don't have to explain various words, and I don't have to dredge up horrible memories in order to get people to understand exactly what I'm referring to.  And the potential progressive value of "education" is something that we connect to on a personal level, it being something we've had to do individually in order to (for example) stay employed.  

The second question you linked to is one that no one of us can answer altogether, one that no one of us should be expected to.  Of course I can't give you an all-context taxonomy for what's offensive when and how.  Try me.  I'll respond to you as thoughtfully as I responded to the guy who wanted to know all about transsexual nipple resizing today.  

And please stop laboring under the misconception that answering stupid and/or ignorant questions from well-meaning and/or abusive strangers isn't something that every outsider does every day.  I've never met one who didn't.  I guess my work will be done when I do.

piny, as I mentioned in the email earlier, I wasn't refering to your not answering my questions or addressing my concerns, but those commenters like OhioBoy who continue to repeat the same ignorant arguments again and again, despite the fact that you've addressed the problems with them, I've addressed the problems with them, practically _everyone_'s addressed the problems with with, &c.  I was venting my general frustration about how some people not only don't listen but proudly and willfully refuse to do so.  It's frustrating, and I apologize if, in my frustration, I seem to have ridden roughshod over those I respect.

Frank, as I just said, I responded to that already over there and am not inclined to repeat it here, no matter how germane it is to this conversation or that other one.  It's just inappropriate, frankly.
