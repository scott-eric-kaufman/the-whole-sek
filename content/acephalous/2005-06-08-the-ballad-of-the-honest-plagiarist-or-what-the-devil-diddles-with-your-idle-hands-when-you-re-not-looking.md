## The Ballad of the Honest Plagiarist, or What the Devil Diddles With Your Idle Hands When You're Not Looking

Most of the people who read this blog, as well as what I write over on [the Valve](http://www.thevalve.org/go), don't have the luxury of teaching literary journalism.  To them I hurl hurtful words about how rewarding teaching literary journalism is _and_ how refreshing reading drafts of student articles meant not to impress but entertain is.  (The grading grammar hangover, as the syntax of that previous sentence makes abundantly clear, still bedevils literary journalism instructors.)  After a quarter spent teaching the middle- to high-brow techniques commonly employed by literary journalists, I'm faced with a situation in which commenting on student papers involves little more than line-editing, pointing to the techniques the students should've already gleaned from articles already read and the occasional finger-wagging when a student's "research" underwhelms.  (Before accusations of academic sinecure start flying around, carefully consider the phrase "little more than line-editing.")  This quarter I pushed back the _first draft_ of the required writing component of the course to Week 9, the quarter's penultimate week, with the thought that the more time the students concentrate on reading, the better the final articles will be.  

Boy.  Howdy.

These first drafts floored me.  While still suffering from many of the problems that all young literary journalists must overcome, these first drafts are far suprior to any first drafts past students have produced.  Not only that, some of these first drafts are better than many of the final drafts past students have produced.  In the past, I've had first drafts due in Week 7, the thought being that the more revisions the better.  But there's a trade-off: because the students already writing in Weeks 5, 6 and 7, they're not paying as much attention to the assigned reading as they otherwise might.  (I suspect that, up-swept in the rush to produce their first drafts, they may do very little of the assigned reading.)  This quarter, they focused on reading, analyzing and discussing articles until Week 8 and what I've discovered is this: those 4 or 5 extra weeks of dedicated reading make all the difference in the world.  These students are impressively intuitive because, technically speaking, they fucking get it. 

Why then do you suppose that so many undergraduate papers for literature classes are so patently awful?  The commonplace complaint of English professors--the students don't read criticism and therefore don't know how to produce it--always rings hollow.  The Balkanization of the profession ensures that even a student well-versed in criticism is unlikely to produce what a particular professor considers a competent critical analysis.  What these students need is some way to read hundreds of superior student essays, to mine them not for ideas--that's plagiarism, and plagiarism, as we all know, is the devil's third favorite past-time after putting idle hands to use and masturbation--but for proficiency.  English undergraduates write terrible papers because they don't fucking get it.  They can't because they're never exposed to what good undergraduate English essays look like; or they know what an abstract model of a good undergraduate English essay looks like but have never seen or produced one themselves.  So why not provide students throughout the quarter with examples of excellent essays.  Start a farm for superior essays on _Huck Finn_, teach the essays alongside the book, then write a prompt that makes it impossible for the students to plagiarize any of the essays you've provided (or encourage them to learn about citation and allow them citational privileges).  Maybe then they'll fucking get it.  

[Note: I intended this to turn into an amusing diatribe in favor of plagiarism--packed to perfection with slips down slopes dewy with rubbing alcohol into pits lined with razors--but actually convinced myself that this might not be an entirely untenable idea.  How's about them apples?]

I think you've hit the nail on the head; undergraduates in most classes are being graded for producing an artificial genre - the undergraduate paper.  This genre is still very much a product of 1950s New Criticism - i.e., close reading with thin or non-existent historical research and little awareness of the critical debates going on in the present time.  It doesn't correspond to what professors as scholars actually produce in their own published work, which is why most graduate students have to re-learn how to write in their first semester.  My solution when I was teaching 28A,B,C was eventually just to pass around sample passages from student papers and discuss what analytical techniques work, which ones don't, etc.  But it would be far better to have compilations of polished papers.

\*You\* may be able to stop \*your\* students plagiarising those essays, but if in electronic format they'll soon get uploaded to one of the cheat sites so that everyone elses can.  Anecdote ahoy! A few years ago I was a TA for first year sociology at a reasonably prestigious English university, I set up a website for my students with hints, tips and reading suggestions.  I also included a (middling) essay of mine from when I did a similar course as an undergraduate along with comments as to its strengths and weaknesses.  The URL to this website I gave to my students on the introductory material I handed out to them.  It was not linked from anywhere else and not Googlible.  You can guess how this ends.  Recently, doing a vanity search on Google, I find that a number of cheat sites are willing to sell my own essay back to me.

Making the location or access to a paper stockpile evidently doesn't work to prevent them from being plagiarized.  How about instead making them as easy to find as possible?  Make it so that your collection pops up as close to the top of a search as you can, and let the fools that would claim your work as their own suffer when their professors already know the source.

Have you read Gerald Graff's "Clueless in Academe"?  While not talking about literary journalism, he makes much the same arguments as you do:  Students don't know how to argue about ideas because they don't get to see models of successful arguments.

I recently returned to school after a long hiatus and completed my English B.A.  The professor for my capstone course thoughtfully included several student essays from previous classes in the course packet, and I can't understate how grateful I was for those model essays.  The essays gave me a concrete sense of what kind of work was possible and, more importantly, what kind of work was acceptable.  This probably kept my anxiety to a minimum, too -- I remember reading the model essays and thinking, "I can do better than that."

I suppose the model essays weren't generally helpful in this case, though.  I spoke to my professor at the end of the semester, and he didn't even try to conceal his disappointment with most of the work the class had turned in.  But the conversation then turned to his impending retirement, and that cheered him up right away.

Providing model essays is of course a common technique in comp classes, and my students are very grateful when I spend some time on them. I see no reason why it can't work for English majors, too. I feel in general that the amount of time we spend on teacching writing in literature courses is totally inadequate, if it happens at all.

One anti-plagiarism technique that I'm rather tempted to induldge in is the fake paper, e.g. [this"&gt;http://flyingmoose.org/tolksarc/homework.htm"&gt;this](&lt;a) synopsis of Tolkien.

Thanks for pointing me in the direction of this post. I think I'm going to try out the sample paper idea. I used the technique to prepare my Master's students for their 3 day M.A. quals, and I found that their performance on a mock exam was much higher than those of different students who actually took the exam but had never seen a sample response and discussed it.
