Sometimes the historical record tells us nothing about what happened.  Case in point: the "panic" incited by Orson Welle's 1938 radio play of _War of the Worlds_.  [Some](http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/nether\_fictoid7.htm) claim that the panic is an institutional artifact, the result of Hadley Cantril's attempt to legitimize social psychology.  That claim's misleading, however, as Cantril's 1940 study--_The Invasion from Mars: a Study in the Psychology of Panic_--was written under the aegis of the already extant Princeton Radio Project.  The PRP, funded by a Rockefeller grant [which may have been a series of laundered CIA disbursements](http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/oss/foundingfathers.htm), opened its doors in 1937 and many of its members--apparently everyone except [Adorno](http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=10&q=http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Adorno.html&e=9888)--became ranking officials in the intelligence community after America entered WWII.

So the odds of Cantril perpetuating the "panic myth" to establish social psychology as a science are slim.  Why would someone with access to the halls of power need to establish his credentials?  Nevermind.  

My mind swarms with visions of Creationists and ID proponents lobbying the administration for intellectual responsibility.  But that's fundamentalists demanding the scientific community recognize the legitimacy of their "science" through political channels.  They're lobbying the administration; Cantril and his fellow PRP'ers were sought out by the government because of the accepted legitimacy of their work.  If Cantril has nothing to gain professionally by disseminating the "panic myth"--_i.e._ if it's not invented whole-cloth--then we're left to debate the degree of "panic" involved.  Here's what we know:

1.  people didn't jump off buildings
2.  people didn't stand armed on front porches
3.  people did overwhelm the telephone circuits
4.  people did try to verify the truth of the claims (esp. in New Jersey)
5.  people did believe that the nation's response to the program had been widespread panic

What this means isn't that the "panic" didn't occur, only that it fell somewhere between someone actually yelling "FIRE!" in a crowded theater (400 victims hoaxed) and the latest outbreak of mad-cow disease (all beef-eating Americans).  What all three situations do point to is the power of adient motives.  

Adient motives influence people to believe with little evidence or logic what would normally be rejected as erroneous by common sense.  The adient factors involved in the "panic" Welles caused would be, naturally, the general culture of unbelievability cultivated by the news filtering in from Europe.  As Rabbi Jonah B. Wise, of the Central Synagogue on 652 Lexington Avenue, said in his sermon the week after the "panic":
Hitler has made a Frankenstein of himself and of Germany.  Last Sunday night people in the whole of the United States were running away in panic fear from Adolph Hitler.

His counterpart at the Congregation Rodeph Sholom of 7 West Eighty-third Street, Rabbi Louis I. Newman, concurred:
The gullibility which masses of people showed concerning the radio broadcast gives a clear indication of the reasons why myths regarding races and religions are so easily believed.

What this means is that, in the end, both the panic and dissemination of the "panic myth" is all Hitler's fault.  It's directly his fault because the outlandishness of the news from Europe primed people to believe anything they heard on the radio; it's indirectly his fault because Jewish leaders jumped on the "panic myth" in order to convince the American people of the even more outlandish events that were being reported, albeit piecemeal, but weren't being believed.  

And because the Communications Commision (apparently not yet Federal) banned the use of "flash" and "bulletin" in all non-hard-news radio programs, we can also blame Hitler for the _Flesh Gordon_ Riots of '40 and '41.
