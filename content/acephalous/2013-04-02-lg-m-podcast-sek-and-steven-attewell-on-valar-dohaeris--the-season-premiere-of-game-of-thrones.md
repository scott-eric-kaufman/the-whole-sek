In this podcast, Steven Attewell, author of the indispensable [_Race for the Iron Throne_ blog](http://racefortheironthrone.wordpress.com/) and [general internet celebrity](youtu.be/NvCDa0Y1QPQ#t=03m42s), joins Yours Truly for a rousing discussing of "Valar Dohaeris" that was in no way ruined by me [posting everything I had to say about the episode three hours earlier](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/04/game-of-thrones-valar-dohaeris-indeed-but-who-where-to-what-end). Because it turns out that, in the presence of experts, the smartest people are the best listeners. All spoilers are prefaced by a damned fool loudly declaiming against them and I'm responsible for 99 percent of the salty language, for which I apologize in advance but will not be endeavoring to amend. Enjoy!
