That I love The National should [surprise no one](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/the\_national/), but that's not why I'm being frivolous on a Friday night and linking to their recent performance of "Mr. November" at Lollapalooza.  I link because of the incidental jollity contained within and created by this unspectacular performance of a weaker track off their last album.  The performance is captured from the crowd by [R. Todd Morason](http://www.youtube.com/user/RTMorasonMD):





The first memorable moment occurs at the 1:29 mark, when lead singer Matt Berninger drunkenly staggers over and begins to serenade a young girl seated on the left stage terrace.  As soon as he notices her, he cleans up the lyric "I won't fuck you over, I'm Mr. November" for her delicate ears.  Her mother snaps a picture and [writes up the experience](http://www.canyouseethesunset.com/article/lollapalooza-kidzapalooza-recap-day-3/).  Having two bits of demonstrable proof of so unlikely event means we are living in the future.

Berninger then ambles off the stage entirely and into the crowd (2:10), at which point Morason loses him.   __ He turns his phone to the large screens flanking the stage in an attempt to find him but fails (2:25), then pans right to survey the crowd again only to discover Berninger's about to run into him (2:33).  The whole scene seems choreographed, right down to the crowd becoming a communal road crew and passing Berninger's wire above their heads.\*

What began as a slightly off-key performance of a mediocre song becomes the sort of spectacle we all wish every concert will be as the lights dim and the first note sounds.

\*Videos like this make me think the shaky cam's days as a hallmark of televisual realism are numbered.  The autocorrection function in cheap new cameras steadies all hands to the point where, in ten years, people will wonder why they let cinematographers continue rolling while in the midst of epileptic fits.

Never heard of them (either I don't pay enough attention or it's one of those bands that don't make it out of the US) but I can see why you like them based on that performance.

I've never actually seen them live, but for some reason all the videos I've seen of them live online haven't really made me want to see them.  Hard to tell, I suppose filtered through low quality video/sound, but Matt's voice just never seems right when I hear online.  Maybe he's doubling it a lot on the recordings or something

1) I would be annoyed if I paid for this performance. A wobbly walk through the crowd is not professional. Are his vocals so pedestrian that this performance creates a similar reaction to the studio track? I find the presumably employed, mature adults who get off on the opportunity to sing with this fellow very entertaining.     

2) These amateur videos are incredible, but when you are standing behind the dozens of people filming them you cannot see a damn thing.
