It will surprise no one who read [my previous post](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/08/its-here-its-finally-here-today-i-can-be-a-proud-white-man-again) to learn that the folks at _Big Hollywood_ loved _The Expendables_ exactly as much as they <strike>are ideologically required to</strike> anticipated.  Still, John Nolte’s [review](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jjmnolte/2010/08/14/the-expendables-reminds-us-why-matt-damon-sucks/) is a teleological marvel.  What he _likes_ about the film is

> the simple straight-forward plot, all the B-movie mayhem  you could possibly ask for, and two unapologetic hours of  masculinity—which may be two hours more than we’ve seen in all of the  last decade put together.  These boys smoke cigars, drink beer while  piloting airplanes, and return us to those glorious pre-Oprah days when  stoicism was still a virtue and real men didn’t gush about their  inner-emotional lives like 13 year-old girls drunk on Dr. Pepper at a  slumber party.

Maybe someone should tell him that the reason flat characters don’t “gush” about “their inner-emotional lives” is because _they don’t have them_.  Maybe I should.  I suppose I will.  Please, Mr. Nolte, continue:

> Sylverster Stallone’s glorious throwback to the brawny 80s is also _about_ something, and it’s not Bourne-ian self-discovery. It’s about something  that actually matters. And in this age of nihilism when believing in  anything bigger than self is considered old-fashioned, unsophisticated  and naïve, that’s both refreshing and important.

If you insist on italicizing the word “about,” you might want to  indicate what that “something” that it’s about actually is.  Sorry, I’m  being rude. Mr. Nolte, you may continue:

> The story opens with a well-crafted action sequence  involving Somalia pirates that not only establishes how deadly competent  our guys are, but also that they’re not cold-blooded killers.  These  are men with a moral code and one of their own breaking that code will  be the root cause of deadly complications and a couple over the top  action sequences to come.

So these are mercenaries who only ever fight the good fight?  If I may, Mr. Nolte, let me recommend my friend Adam Roberts’s [post on _Iron Man_](http://punkadiddle.blogspot.com/2010/05/iron-man-2008.html), in which he notes that that film adheres to

> the dream narrative of US military involvement in the  Middle East: one American is able to go to Afghanistan, kill only the  bad Afghans, leave all the good Afghani men women and children alive and  leap away into the sky.

That “dream narrative” isn’t the product of a moral code, but simply a  denial of the reality of reality.  But I should let you finish:

> The plot gets a nudge courtesy of a self-referential  Meeting of The Titans. Ever in search of a job, Barney meets with  “Church” (Bruce Willis), a CIA spook in need of some housecleaning that  won’t make headlines and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a long-time rival.  Cinematically this is far from a great scene—

First, stop [pretending to be German](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/thesis-writing-formal-essays-turns-certain-people-into-germans.html).   Second, I think you’re starting to realize that you didn’t even like  the film.  You call it a “B-movie,” rate its action scenes as “over the  top,” and now you’re criticizing how it films _a conversation_.  What did you think of the dialogue?

> [T]hese aren’t men who talk a whole lot, and when they do  it’s usually in the form of affectionate crowd-pleasing insults that  might not move the plot or add character dimension, but once again  Stallone (who co-wrote the screenplay with Dave Callahan) knows his  audience.

I definitely think you  hated this film.  I mean, you’re _praising_ dialogue that neither advanced the plot or added depth to the  characters because, to your mind, Stallone’s audience consist of people  who prefer pointless banter.  I can’t even tell whether you’re insulting  them more than your own intelligence here or vice versa.  Wait, I have a  test:

> There’s also a kind of validation that comes with the  price of admission, especially for those of us who couldn’t figure out  why in the hell anyone would call metro-sexuals angsting over calling  evil what it is and apologizing for America an action movie.
> 
> “The Expendables” proves us right.
> 
> Matt Damon sucks and the eighties freaking ruled.

I’m still not sure, but I will say this: your intelligence deserves  to be insulted, because the reason you’re saying “Matt Damon sucks” is  that he starred in movies with “Bourne-ian self-discovery,” whereas _The Expendables_ “freaking ruled” because it was of the 1980s.  Guess what?  So’s [_The Bourne Identity_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bourne_Identity_%28novel%29) (1980) and, of course, [_The Bourne Identity_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bourne_Identity_%281998_film%29) (1988).

Hate to burst your bubble, Mr. Nolte, but your precious ’80s were a  bit smarter and more “inner-emotional” than you’ve chosen to remember  them as.

Could we please just agree that we've had enough Michael Cera- and Seth Rogan-esque heroes?  Whiny neurotic men just don't do it for me anymore.

So what you're saying is you're _glad Scott Pilgrim_ tanked, even though it was directed (apparently quite well) by the talented Edgar Wright?  I see.  I haven't seen either film yet, but I'd prefer to support the careers of people 1) under 60 and 2) with actual new ideas (or an intimate knowledge of what a mashup is, and how to make it work).

"Could we please just agree that we've had enough Michael Cera- and Seth Rogan-esque heroes?"

Here's a counter-offer: no.

"Whiny neurotic men just don't do it for me anymore."

You're more into well-oiled, masculine, strapping older men flexing their big muscles through their tank tops while firing giant machine guns? I think I see what you're saying.

After posting it, I felt bad for that cheap shot in my second paragraph.  I don't know anything about Matthew Merlino and don't mean to project onto him my irritation with the attitude expressed by John Nolte.  (Similarly, Scott, Matt didn't say he wanted _Pilgrim_ to fail.)  There's nothing wrong with expressing a preference against a particular type of character.

The Matt Damon/Bourne-bashing betrays the shallowness of the BG consideration of the issue. Bourne is a loyal and effective soldier betrayed by elements of his own out-of-control government, one which has taken to carrying out private vendettas and wasting taxpayer money on dead-end, pie-in-the-sky projects. Bourne never has moral qualms about his actions, and wants to be left alone: he's a perfect libertarian, and their failure to recognize this is just one more piece of evidence that they don't understand themselves, much less anything else.

I don't know anything about Matthew either, and I haven't seen any of these movies (nor will I).  But any sentence that begins "Can we please just agree" just shouldn't lead to another one that complains about whiny neurotic men.  Form and content shouldn't clash like that, or, you know, someone has to burn down the sentence with a flamethrower that he lights from his cigar as he stoically ignores the pain of having to read it.

Wow.  It's like I tweaked someone's nipple.  Didn't realize the Michael Cera love went this deep.

First off, Rich, you're being a little tone deaf.  Then again, there's not enough of my initial post to get any real sense of tone.  Needless to say, I'm not whining.  

Second, Scott, no, I didn't care if \*Scott Pilgrim\* succeeded or didn't.  It looks like a retreat of other Michael Cera movies, only this time with Real Live Special Effects.  Do I need to see another awkward man-child chase after a hipster girl?  Not really, not after \*300 Days of Summer\* or \*Chasing Amy\* or \*Nick & Nora\* or or or.  The fact that the plot plays like a video game doesn't help it in my books, because as you know, I'm a pretty big snob when it comes to comics, video games, etc.  

Finally, you can defend the whiny man-child hero.  I'll take Bogart or Brando.

Matthew, when people object to what you write, you should consider whether they might be objecting to your mode of expression rather than the content.  Most people do not mind hearing that someone else doesn't like a particular actor.  On the other hand, it tends to stick in people's craw when you say that they should "please just agree" to agree with your position, whether you're talking art, politics, or what have you.

I can't tell whether you saw _500 Days of Summer_ and _Nick & Nora_ or not.  I didn't, because the reviews weren't good and no one recommended I see them, which I find is a good way to save my money and keep from getting annoyed.  Did you see them expecting to enjoy them?  Or expecting not to enjoy them?  Or did you not see them but are annoyed with the trend anyway?  Nothing wrong with that—I'm annoyed by the incessant trend of remakes—but I don't find it productive to simply ask for people to stop liking them; if I'm going to talk about them at all I'd rather give an argument for why they're bad, rather than gripe about a personal preference.

I've stopped enjoying Anthony Lane's criticism because all he does is harp on modern pop cinema (often the really easy targets, _Speed Racer_, e.g.) and complain that it's not as good as the old stuff.  That's a pretty shoddy way to make a living, but at least he gets paid for it; I don't know what would make one do it for free.  There ain't going to be no more new Bogart or Brando movies, so I would find some new stuff you like—or blog about the old—rather than just going around stating contrary preferences without elaboration.

Tomemos -- like I said, I clearly tweaked someone's nipples.  I really don't really too much about Michael Cera.  I pick on him because it's fun.  But it's interesting to see the response, to see how much some people have invested in such a limited actor.

I mean, I guess I can understand.  I used to defend Scarlett Johansson a lot, before simply accepting that, although she's wildly talented, she has no idea how to choose the right roles (or how to turn Woody Allen down).  

In the end, though, I was watching Altman's \*3 Women\* tonight, and I remembered just how different a great movie from any of this trite crap, whether it's Sly Stallone or Michael Cera.

If you think that action movies are all terrible now that "real men ... gush about their inner-emotional lives", doesn't this compel you to think that _Die Hard_ was where action movies started to go wrong? And isn't that a patently absurd thing to think?

Ah yes, the oldest trick in the book: "I totally don't care, but I got you to reveal that _you_ care, and _I just think that's interesting._  Checkmate!!"

If you were really confident in the greatness of your favorite cinema, you wouldn't feel compelled to compare it to every summer film that comes along.  No one was expecting Edgar Wright to dethrone Altman, so your interest in putting them in the ring together shows me that you're a lot less secure in your personal canon than you like to project.  _I just think that's interesting._

Don't know about you, but I'm about equally into "well-oiled, masculine, strapping older men flexing their big muscles through their tank tops while firing giant machine guns" as I am into Michael Cera- and Seth Rogan-esque whiny neurotic men. 

On Saturda mornings I have a greasy breakfast, go to the gym, and then I go back hometo be whiny and neurotic for the rest of the afternoon. And by God I'm proud of it.

No, Tomemos, you're inventing some intentionality where none exists.  I had no intention of showing that anyone cared about Michael Cera or the whiny man-child hero.  Which is why I so confidently asked, "Can we all just agree, et cetera?"  I was actually surprised by this reaction.  It's one thing to enjoy Cera in \*Arrested Development\* (he's a child, after all); it's another to put up with the same character in every one of his films, and the same character in so many other films.  

And yeah, of course I'm insecure about my "canon," as you put it.  Not because I'm not confident that it's superior, but because artistic superiority means nothing today.  We don't teach it, we don't appreciate it, we don't write about it, we don't read about it.  It's an endangered species.  And when we get smart people arguing over the relative merits of a Stallone or Cera picture, well, I think we're in trouble.

While I find the "ubi sunt" tone annoying too, I wouldn't say Matthew has been trolling.  Just moaning.

Over here ([http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/movie-talk-sylvester-stallone-blames-batman.html),](http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/movie-talk-sylvester-stallone-blames-batman.html),) you can see Stalone blame the decline of the 80s muscle-and-gun genre on Tim Burton's Batman. The terms he employs are hilarious. 

"He went on to say, 'The action movies changed radically when it became possible to Velcro your muscles on,' a clear dig at how the trim Keaton was encased in a sculpted Batsuit for the film. Stallone joked, 'I wish I had thought of Velcro muscles myself... I didn't have to go to the gym for all those years.'"

He then goes on to make a distinction between how Burton made action films less about the actor and more about the style of the film. What strikes me as significant about Stallone's values is that he underplays the art of film making (direction, custom design) for the mere physicality of the actor. However, it also seems significant that Stalone's discourse suggests a language of masculinity and self-improvement that sees the strong male action hero attacked by directors, geeks, and other collaborators whose existence are necessary for any film to be made, let alone an action film.

It's so interesting how the term "troll" is used to police thought on these threads.  You know, it's hard to be a troll when I've been commenting on Scott's blog for, I dunno, seven years now?  Sometimes I agree with him, sometimes I disagree.  But when I disagree under my real name, and not my blog name (Luther Blissett), I get called a troll.  It goes to show how much uniformity of thought people basically desire.

And no, it's not a "kids these days" complaint.  I \*am\* one of the kids these days.  No, it's more a complaint about what the previous generation of intellectuals did to the standards of taste.  I'm a rebel against old fogies who "deconstructed" the canon.  

And JPool, sorry if the nipple tweaking gets you down.  In any case, I touched a nerve by not joining the Michael Cera whiny man-child lovefest.

Matthew, I found out who you were after my first comment, and for the record I find your repetitive smugness just as monotonous and annoying regardless of the persona you use.  Maybe if I point out that, in this "Michael Cera lovefest," **not one person has praised Michael Cera**, you'll realize that people are objecting to your superciliousness rather than the content of your opinions, as I said before.  But most likely you'll keep chortling to yourself about how you touched a nipple.

It's impossible for just one person to have the blog name Luther Blissett.  I'm disappointed if it hasn't been a group name locally.

Tomemos, like I wrote before, there's not enough text here to garner any sense of tone. My initial comment simply asked if, whatever our feelings about Sly Stallone's nonsense are, we could agree that we want some sort of hero that's, well, heroic.

The answer to that question was uniformly "no." Which, while not an outright defense of Cera (which Scott certainly did undertake by accusing me of hoping \*Scott Pilgrim\* bombed), is a defense of the characters he has embodied.

And it's sort of hard to be the supercilious one in a thread in which commenters are feeling quite brave for attacking a moronic right-wing blog post about a Sly Stallone flick. I mean, come on, I thought it was a contest of smug superiority!

Finally, Rich, I have no idea what you're talking about. "Luther Blissett" is a group name, and I never claimed ownership. But the "Luther Blissett" who has commented here and at The Valve and at Crooked Timber and at the Chronicle and elsewhere is me and me alone. Sorry if you think that's impossible, but it is so.

Just because you're young doesn't mean you're not perpetrating a declensionist argument that has no basis in reality. Just because you're a regular doesn't mean that you're not trolling this discussion. Just because we find your statements here to be inane in the extreme doesn't mean that a competently-made argument against the prevailing sentiment won't get treated seriously, as it usually is. I don't always agree with you as Blisset, either - for the most part our comments pass by each other without ever touching on the same topics - but under that name you're usually a better writer and interlocutor.

Matthew,
You get called a troll when you behave trollishly: ascribing positions to people that they haven't espoused; not responding to people's points directly, but rather insiting that their response reveals something about them; redirecting discussion of any particular work to a generalized complaint about the culture. None of these moves result in productive dialog but instead seem designed to insult/piss off the people you're writing to.

If you want to be a cultural reactionary, that's fine (I mean, I'll fight you on the barricades, but in that ineffectual post-structuralist "yes, and"/"no, but" way), but you still have to actually make arguments for your critical judgements and not just insist that those who might disagree who you are ... something or other.

""Luther Blissett" is a group name, and I never claimed ownership. But the "Luther Blissett" who has commented here and at The Valve and at Crooked Timber and at the Chronicle and elsewhere is me and me alone."

I wasn't saying that it is impossible for a single person to have used the Luther Blissett pseudonym in a group of related blogs over a long period of time. I was saying that I was disappointed if this were so.

I'm disappointed because, again, this is self-contradictory rhetoric. Luther Blissett is a group name, and no single person can claim ownership of it. But claiming ownership (well, authorship) is what you're doing, within a context that may be limited to a number of years and a group of blogs, but that is still the entire context that you expect us to have seen comments by LB in.

Are you really sure that you are the sole and only LB within this context? If someone else had once gone to the Valve, or somewhere, and posted a comment as LB, would you have noticed? Complained and said that you were the true LB in this parish?

This identity crisis reminds me of Martin Guerre, which also gave me an idea:

Michael Cera in a Martin Guerre remake updated for the Iraq/Afghanistan/facebook/hipster set.

This is ridiculous. I began by addressing the core concern of the post Scott was fisking: the hero in Hollywood film. Scott was going after an easy target, while clearly holding up Scott Pilgrim as some sort of antidote. So I wanted to suggest that, while Stallone heroes are worthless, the Cera hero is equally played out. No trolling there. Just disagreeing, and asking Scott to question his own assumptions of value before knocking those of the Big Hollywood thugs. Physician, heal thyself and all that. It was the stupid personal attacks - and accusations of trolling are nothing but personal attacks - that shifted the conversation off topic, as you all circled your wagons to avoid thinking critically about your own sacred cow.

_Scott was going after an easy target, while clearly holding up Scott Pilgrim as some sort of antidote._

I was, but not because of Michael Cera. I specifically mentioned Edgar Wright because, as director and the writing partner of Simon Pegg, his films (Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz) have consistently been playing with genre conventions instead of into them (as The Expendables does). In short, I was saying that we can have summer fare that revels in its obsolescence, or material that at least attempts to be interesting. I said we ought to support the latter, which has nothing to do with Michael Cera except for the decision to cast him in this role. (And honestly, casting a young, disaffected Canadian to play a young, disaffected Canadian doesn't seem like much of a stretch to me. This is the kind of role in which Cera's shtick works because, if it's true to the books, his ironic distance is persistently undermined.)

Scott, two points:

1. The Big Hollywood reviews don't really big up the issue of genre or convention. So to argue with them on that point seems misguided. Instead, they address the issue of the figure of the hero. I brought up Michael Cera not as an actor but as a certain kind of hero -- and my problem with that kind of hero is mostly the fact that it's being overdone by the same actors over and over again. I meant "Michael Cera" as a metonymic reference to that sort of hero. Personally, I have a plague on both houses position here: the Sly Stallone and Michael Cera heroes are equally worthless. I feel like they are two sides of the same coin: stereotypical physical presence with no emotional depth, and stereotypical emotional messiness with no physical presence.

2. This whole "playing with conventions" defense troubles me as well. It's what I heard so many times with *500 Days of Summer* -- "See, it's not another cliched rom-com; it's a self-referential, arch rom-com." Except that rom-coms since the 40s have been arch, and merely playing with conventions is not enough to make an effective piece of art. Lady Gaga plays with conventions, but she's still terrible.

"I feel like they are two sides of the same coin: stereotypical physical presence with no emotional depth, and stereotypical emotional messiness with no physical presence."

Now I think that is a valid critique, although I have not seen many Michael Cera movies. You can combine them to get The Hurt Locker, but this is fairly rare; more commonly, you get a lopsided combination, as in Inception, for example. Competently produced, balanced enough to be decent, etc. Not a masterpiece, but most of us do not have tastes as critical as this readership's.

I rather liked Inception, but I belong to the tribe of semi-casual watchers who can only understand why a movie affected them the way it did after a great deal of retrospection and introspection. I do believe that an emotional movie can stand on its own much more effectively than an action movie, but good movies often require a combination of both.

In other words, most people here will probably agree that you can make an excellent movie with a near total emphasis on emotion and character, while you cannot make an excellent movie by ignoring those factors. Compare Citizen Kane to Transformers 2 (An unfair comparison, but I cannot think of any movies that fit into the latter category and have stood the test of time. Telling).

It seems to me (despite how admittedly untrained and lowly my critical mind may be) that you object to a movie that has no action and relatively weak characterization more than you do to one that has no characterization and decent action, which is a fair complaint. An action movie, after all, can still delight us with big booms and macho catchphrases, although we forget about it the very next day.
