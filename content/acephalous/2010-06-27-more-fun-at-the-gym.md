(_SCOTT and NICE CLUELESS GUY are on treadmills watching the Germany-England match_)
**NICE CLUELESS GUY:** Germany's winning, must make you happy, "Kaufman."

**SCOTT:** (_who hasn't been on a treadmill but for a month_)  I ... was ... rooting ... for ... England.

**NICE CLUELESS GUY:** But isn't "Kaufman" a German name?

**SCOTT:** German ... Jew.

**NICE CLUELESS GUY:** So why aren't you supporting Germany?

**SCOTT:** German ... _Jew._

**NICE CLUELESS GUY:** So why aren't you—

**SCOTT:** Hitler?

**NICE CLUELESS GUY:** Right ... right ... you gonna put this on your blog?

**SCOTT:** I ... wouldn't ... do ... that.

**NICE CLUELESS GUY:** Because if you do, could you call me "Nice Clueless Guy," so my wife recognizes me?

To be fair, I supported Germany, and I'm Jewish. I guess I have an especially soft spot for the underdog (or the team that popular image would paint as the underdog).
