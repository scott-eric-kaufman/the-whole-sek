## Save Academic Freedom: Tell UCLAProfs.com To Turn It Up A Notch!

Hard-core conservatives like myself are appalled, I say, _appalled_ by how many patently liberal professors [Andrew Jones](http://www.uclaprofs.com/) doesn't condemn.  A quick study of the English department demonstrates how insufficient Jones' list is.  He ignores, for example, [Blake Allemendinger](http://www.english.ucla.edu/faculty/allmendi/), who wrote a book with the word "labor" in the title.  What of [Christopher _C._ Baswell](http://www.english.ucla.edu/faculty/baswell/), so invidious a liberal he _withholds_ his interests for fear of conservative backlash but _includes_ his middle initial in his name.  Who does he think he is?  John _F._ Kennedy?  We know he wants to be.

Then there's [Lynn Batten](http://www.english.ucla.edu/faculty/batten/).  A woman.  Need I say more?  [Ali Behdad](http://www.english.ucla.edu/faculty/behdad/)?  _Ali?_  Anti-semite.  [King-Kok Cheung](http://www.english.ucla.edu/faculty/cheung/) is 1) a foreigner, 2) a graduate of _UC Berkeley_ and 3) interested in _gender_.  _Gender_.  Why not call this "English" Department what it is?  The Department of Destroying the Nuclear Family.  

I thought I had found an ally in [Michael Colacurcio](http://www.english.ucla.edu/faculty/colacurc/), author of "A Poise of the Spirit," until I saw he had also written _Doctrine and Difference_.  _Doctrine_?  Fine.  But _Difference_?  That sounds like multiculturalism to my American ears.  I'm sure he and [Alicia Gaspar de Alba](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/chavez/gaspar.html) stay up all night discussing "Chicano/a Art" and giggle like little brown girls during [Cristina](http://www.univision.com/content/channel.jhtml?schid=7501)'s commercial breaks.

What about [Rachel Lee](http://www.english.ucla.edu/faculty/rlee/index.html)?  Dual appointment with English and _Women_'s Studies.  How do you spell "me-search"?  At UCLA you can also spell it [M-C-H-E-A-C-H-E-R-N](http://www.english.ucla.edu/faculty/mceacher/) or [M-C-H-U-G-H](http://www.english.ucla.edu/faculty/mchughla/).  "They will never take our [FREEDOM](http://www.alyon.org/generale/theatre/cinema/affiches\_cinema/b/blo-bru/braveheart(2).jpg)"?  Not if these two Scottish "rebels" have their druthers.  But Ms. Lesbian Lee and the Department's Scottish Feministas haven't cornered the radical leftist market on attacking the sanctity of marriage.  

[Anne Mellor](http://www.english.ucla.edu/faculty/mellor/index.html) wrote an entire book on _Women's Political Writing in England_.  Were there not enough men to study, Ms. Mellor?  Or could they not stand the stench of your tangled, unwashed pits?  [Jinqi Ling](http://www.english.ucla.edu/faculty/jling/), an illegal immigrant, writes Marxist propaganda in classic diversity double-speak: _Ideology and Form in Asian American Literature_?  Go back to China, Ms. Ling!  No _American_ wants to hear about your precious Chairman Mao.

I could attack this den of anti-American activists for the rest of my life, but the wife says the brisket's done.  Little Nancy and Sally are setting the table as I speak.  How do you think all those queers, foreigners and women would respond to _that_?   

Bet they wouldn't even know where to start.

$50 for full, detailed lecture notes and all professor-distributed materials, for one class!?  Count me in, I'm transferring!

Oh. My. God.  I can't explain how hard you just made me laugh on so many levels.

Dammit, Scott! You made me scare the cat. And now my face hurts.

Couldn't you at least \*warn\* people when you're about to deploy satire like that?

"Tangled...pits?"  It's so, so, so visceral!  Great stuff!

It's worse than you think. Lynn Batten is male. In fact, his full name is CHARLES Lynn Batten. Unpacking the significance of his preference for an androgynous moniker is left as an exercise for the reader.

This is unrelated to the post, but why do my trackbacks always show up twice on your blog? 

Yes, I am anal enough to be bothered by multiple trackbacks showing up at _your_ blog.

Sigh. Are middle initials no longer sacred?
