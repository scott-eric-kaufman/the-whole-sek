"God, why did you create so many fucking idiots?"

Given that I also write for _The Onion_, I feel I should point out that [this article](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/03/06/russell-crowe-film-noah-edited-to-appease-christians-upset-by-historical-inaccuracies/) is _not_ from _The Onion_. But if we were better people — did less of that awful sinning against the Lord and stuff — we could live in a world where it would be.
