## <em>Finally</em>, a Reason to Criticize Hermione Lee

On page 69, we learn:
[Egerton Winthrop] was the third wheel of the Wharton marriage for many years, and one of her most important intellectual advisers.

Edith married Teddy Wharton in 1885.  How to explain this, then, from page 127:
For a few years in the early 1890s ... [Ogden Codman] was a third wheel to the marriage.

That's _four_ wheels, people.  That car/carriage/car is raring to roll.  So much for Lee's damn near-perfect work of scholarship.  But blooped or smoked, a hit's a hit.

When was Winthrop a wheel?  Is it possible that he and Codman never overlapped -- so that there were never more than three?

Sorry, I seem to be congenitally unclear of late: Winthrop was a wheel from 1885 (when they were married) "for many years," which adds up to "well into the next century."  There was certainly overlap.  I should add, though, that while there may have been some times of three, others of four, never were there _five_ wheels, which is odd, given the origin of the expression.  (Spare tire on carriages, from what I can glean.)

_She waas 'as easy as an old shoe' -- a shoe that too many feet had worn. Her elasticity was the result of tension in too many different directions. Alice Haskett -- Alice Varick -- Alice Waythorn -- she had been each in turn, and had left hanging to each name a little of her privacy, a little of her personality, a little of the inmost self where the unknown god abides._

Edith Wharton, _The Other Two_. Here the twice-divorced Alice is serving tea to her husbands, former and current, on the same afternoon.
