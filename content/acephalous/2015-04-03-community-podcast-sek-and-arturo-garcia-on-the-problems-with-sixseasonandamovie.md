So my soon-to-be-former _Raw Story_cohort Arturo Garcia and I decided we had things to say about the sixth season of _Community_, and what better place to say them then in a podcast?\* It contains spoilers for all episodes up to the fourth as well as rampant speculation as to how the season would conclude in an ideal world.

\*I say "soon-to-be-former" because I got a new gig as a staff writer/assistant editor at _Salon_and my thinking is, "life-altering announcements are always best made in footnotes." I start in mid-April and will have more details about what I'll be doing there in the next few weeks.
