From _The New York Times_ [article](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/04/07/opinion/20080407\_TRADING\_GRAPHIC.html#step1) on Wall Street hand signals:

![Working](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/2008/04/07/working.jpg "Working")

Off Wall Street, that gesture signifies something else entirely, _i.e._ what most of us think about what passes for work on Wall Street.

(And Andre, the answer to [your question](http://acephalous.typepad.com/outkast\_gasoline\_dreams.mp3) [.mp3] is, evidently, [no](http://acephalous.typepad.com/gasoline.jpg).Â  Don't worry though, they're still all about burning the American Dream.)

If there were an award for excellent use of an OutKast song in a goofy joke, I'd nominate SEK.
