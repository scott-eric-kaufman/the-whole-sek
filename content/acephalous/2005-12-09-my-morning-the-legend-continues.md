## My Morning: The Legend Continues

I can't write or talk about "my morning" anymore.  I can't say why . . . but don't let that stop you from speculating wildly.  Have wheelchair-bound clowns sporting Hitler costumes kidnapped me?  Did I awake this morning from uneasy dreams to find myself transformed into a gigantic insect who can no longer type or speak?  I'm not at liberty to say.

That said, I can thank you all for your support and encouragement.  I haven't had a stretch this rough in a long time and y'all have helped me through me it.

I wish I could say that I can't imagine how you could possibly be made out to have comported yourself at all  inappropriately in this situation, but I have spent some time in the university environment and thus, unfortunately, can imagine it.  I hope you can take solace in the fact that many of us have encountered the same logic that I imagine you faced--well intentioned but wrong-headed.  Then again, I don't know the specifics and don't wish to malign your university's administration unfairly.  But I can imagine...

P.S. Well, if you didn't awake from uneasy dreams to find yourself metamorphosed, you may well have been traduced.  Either way, you'd have quite a day ahead of you.

As much as it pains me to make a Philip Roth reference, but this seems like something straight out of 'Human Stain.'

What an unfortunate situation. I don't believe you acted inappropriately, and I hope that the university's administration realize that as well.

Aha.  None dare call it censorship, I'm sure.  (I mean, it's not as if you identified the individuals concerned, or gave enough information for such identification to be made ...)

What you guys in the States need is some sort of, I don't know, Bill of Rights or something.  Something that, like, guarantees freedom of speech.  If I were you I'd get right on that.
