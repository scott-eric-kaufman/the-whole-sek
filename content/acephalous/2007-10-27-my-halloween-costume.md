You going to a guitar tech convention for Halloween?

Wouldn't _you_ like to know?  (As if they all aren't equally grungy.)

And Karl, that's an ... interesting costume.  Let me guess: a Mexican wrestler run over by a Pampers truck?

Karl is obviously dressed as one of the persons in the intro and outro to [this video](http://www.channel101.com/shows/view.php?media\_id=1537).

_a Mexican wrestler run over by a Pampers truck?_

Precisely.

SEK, you were the drummer kicked out of Pearl Jam so he could pursue his dream of being a famous asshole?

Karl, clever use of the onesie there, but that's going to be awfully hot and hard to drink through.

Serious, the answer's a lot more prosaic. It's a tribute to a \*very\* twee, er, masque I went to with a colleague (and our spouses) a few weekends ago at a gallery in Chelsea. Look to myspace 'goddess' (a band) for a sense of what I saw. It was their guitarist who wore the onesie. So I pulled a tribute to the experience and its horrors (with the assistance of a $.50 onesie from a stoop sale) for a costume karaoke party. At that point in the evening, I was wearing the onesie over someone else's mask. As for drinking while wearing it: the mouthhole (is that a very dirty word?) had tectonic'd to the side, again, by that point in the evening. I had all too little trouble drinking....

See? Boring.

If I weren't so friggin busy, wife and I were planning on going as Kinski and Herzog on Halloween proper. Next year I suppose.
