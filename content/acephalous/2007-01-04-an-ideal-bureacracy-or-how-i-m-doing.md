			My Dearest Dextral, 

Imagine my surprise when I learned what you were doing!  If upon mature deliberation you decide the misery of forgiving your underlings for their alarming [account of  Mr. Kaufman's recent troubles](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/12/why\_should\_i\_su.html) is something you must bear alone, know now that I approve of your fortitude.  

One of my women once spoke so prematurely.  Last word reached our civilized shores, her punishment more than adequately accorded with the severity of her indiscretion.  Mr. Chathworth tells me it involved _tigers!_  I titter at the thought of her grisly evisceration!

Most Sweet Sinistral, 
No one had informed me of your doings, either!  I informed Mr. Kaufman when first I heard the results of his trial.  Had I but known what you knew, we could have spared him much unrest.  In the future we must confer before relating news whose destiny is to disturb.  Perhaps we should consider our legs forfeit to a tiger?

Beloved Dextral, 
I am rather fond of my legs, as is Mr. Chathworth, who says they are the second finest in the closet in which we neck like parrots stretching for the nut. Were it not for his attentions I would admit of my gross error and bow on bended knee before Mr. Kaufman.  Begging his forgiveness, the closet in which Chathworth and I neck is most regal, truly worthy of the beknighted knickers which cascade down his legs and rumple around those most delicious ankles.  When I grasp his tight bu—

Silly Sinistral, 
I abhor interrupting so sweet a voice as yours, but Chathworth and his quality posterior are of no issue here.  We must recompense poor Mr. Kaufman for—

Dex, 
Much as it pains me to say, you must move on.  Chathworth is mine.  If you cannot accept his choi—

Sin, 
This is not about accepting anyone's decision.  This is about telling Mr. Kaufman that a clerical error forced us to write him a most terrible missive, one whose implications we would have foreseen had we but communicated more openly beforehand.  

We should have examined his medical record and realized that the medication responsible for arousing our suspicions was prescribed by one of our own.  He deserves word of his being as robust as the bull-ox your delicate Mr. Chathworth so dotes on ...

What a relief! And what a clever post!

I'm still making you a care package though. Why?  Because I \_care\_.

Ah, a clerical error! merely the usual natural variation within some poorly understood old bureaucratic category. Per Kafka: Glaubet und wartet! (But the misfiling of [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/04/business/04drug.html) momentarily unsettled.)

There was a young man whose middle name was Eric  

Who had mishaps with matters cleric

Thumped on his hexed skull  

And his consolations, alphanumeric
