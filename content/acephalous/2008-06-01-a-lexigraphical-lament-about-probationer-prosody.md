All scribes utilize lexicons.  [_Roget's_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0060185759%!F(MISSING))![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1)
regnant tome monopolizes the matriculant market.  Neophytes congregate
in monograph outlets to procure a reprint.  They disembark at their
domicile and allocate Peter Roget's linguistical treatise a bearing on
a transversal above their desktop computer.  There it hunkers until a
pedagogue implores them to formulate a polemic.  Then the prentice
wordsmith extracts it.  The pupil employs it to ameliorate his
pedestrian prose.  With hubris he asseverates the eminence of his
phraseological aptitude:

"My profiency with palaver is unparalleled.  Scrutinize my incomparable prose if you don't accredit me!"

The ensuing evening his educator ensconces himself at his trestle to
assess his august pupil's critique.   After he appraises it he thrusts
his extremities on his coutenance.  He again cognizes that graduands
should not be sanctioned to retain Roget's opus because proprietorship
of aforementioned reprehensible receptacle of lexical surrogates
elicits maximal keening from all preceptors.  

"Why!" the mentor declaims at his articulatory apex.  "Why must charges importune their prose with exorbitant diction?"
