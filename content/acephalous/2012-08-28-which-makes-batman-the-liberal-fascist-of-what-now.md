For a split-second, [I liked Grant Morrison a little](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/10/all-star-superman.html), then I realized he'd made me jealous of [Jonah Goldberg](www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385511841/diesekoschmar-20), and [hated him all the more](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/05/annals-of-fauxprundity-grant-morrison-is-writing-a-story-for-you-to-read.html):

[![liberal fascism vicious man-monster](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/liberal-fascism-vicious-man-monster.jpg "liberal fascism vicious man-monster")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/liberal-fascism-vicious-man-monster.jpg)

This exchange occuers in the third issue of _Batman Incorporated_, which unfortunately doesn't end the "[Is Batman a conservative](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/07/the-dark-knight-rises-is-not-a-conservative-film)?"
 debate by having the Batman repeatedly punch this Goldberg-proxy in the
 face. That said, Bulldog may not actually be a Goldberg-proxy, since we
 all know he's a "monster-man," not a "man-monster."

**ACTUALLY:** Given that that's Bruce Wayne in disguise in 
the green there and he's chosen his own rogue's gallery, I suppose it's 
safe to say the Batman is, at the very least, implicitly punching the 
Goldberg-proxy in the face repeatedly. Damn it, now I'm tempted to like 
Morrison again.

In a certain sense I like that conservatives recognize that Batman is such an awesome character that they feel the need to claim him for their ideology. It's kind of hard to blame them. And for the most part I chalk that need up to their tribalism and their conclusions up to confirmation bias. But in the end I obviously wish they would take seriously some of the values Batman stands for.
