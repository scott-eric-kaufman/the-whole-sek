## An Unnamed Meme: Minds Stuffed with Stuff (Useful & Otherwise)

Normally, my life only surfaces on this blog after being twisted by [some](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/disadventure.html) [formal](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/01/minimum\_number\_.html) [constraint](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/sample\_student\_.html) designed to transform tragedy into hilarity.  The Neurophilosopher [tagged me](http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2006/10/04/ive-been-tagged/) with a meme general enough to accomodate a number of things I would've posted were this one of those blogs, so I'm running with it:

				**The Trivial**

*   Yesterday, I had lunch with [Kevin Drum](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/).  The hostess seated us next to [Danny Bonaduce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny\_Bonaduce).  When I pointed this out, Kevin didn't recognize the name.
*   Ninety percent of what I know falls under the category of "Useless Information."  Headquartered near The [Corey Ian Haim](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000433/) Collection of the Foibles of Former Child Stars is The Center for the Study of the Positioning of [David Wright](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David\_Wright\_%!b(MISSING)aseball\_player%!)(MISSING)
Relative to the Third Base Line.  Thanks to a generous grant from The
Society to Prevent Panic Attacks and Binge-Drinking, the Center has
collated an entire season's worth of data and is set to release its
findings in a report tentatively titled "By Far Too Far: He Should Move
Two Feet to His Right." *   This desire for trivial information extends to my academic work.Instead of focusing on major figures of actual artistic merit, I have
chosen to write about the Coreys of the Gilded Age and Progressive
Era.  Popular authors like [Silas Weir Mitchell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silas\_Weir\_Mitchell), [Winston Churchill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston\_Churchill\_%!n(MISSING)ovelist%!)(MISSING) and [Thomas Dixon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas\_Dixon\_%!m(MISSING)inister%!)(MISSING)
wrote pedantic historical novels in a style I'll call "stilted" when
I'm feeling generous and much, much worse when I'm not.  Admirable
though the desire to work on noncanonical literature may be, I suggest
others distinguish works _justly_ from those _unjustly_ forgotten before devoting three years to studying them.

**The Not Entirely Unintellectual**

*   I believe that minds work best when crammed full of on-going narratives.  Not _quality_ narratives—at
least not necessarily so—but a brain full of bookmarks helps keep a
mind healthy.  What do I mean?  What happened on the last episode of [_House_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FVQLIO/diesekoschmar-20)?  [_Battlestar Galactica_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000GFLEAO/diesekoschmar-20)?  The last issue of [_Y - The Last Man_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000IMEZ9W/diesekoschmar-20)?  [_The Runaways_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/078512358X/diesekoschmar-20)?You see where I'm headed here: earlier print cultures forced people to
track hundreds of characters as they danced through serial
entertainment.  Movies are events—forceful but quickly forgotten.  They
aren't _lived with_ the way serials are.  I throw my body on the
couch and my brain kicks into overdrive: "Where are we?  What happened
to him?  Her?  How did he react?  How did she?  Why are we here?"Question piles upon question until I've sorted through everything and
form a reasonable approximation of the present _in media res_ moment
constituted by the splash page or opening credits.  With a novel, the
involvment is intense but fleeting.  Even the longest novel is only
inhabited for a few days tops.  You can re-read it, but re-reading
brings a different set of critical faculties into play than does the _up-to-now_ reconstruction
a serial demands.  Plus, those moments when you distinctly remember
Greg House slugging it out with a fifty-foot tall cybernetic Godzilla?_Priceless_.
*   [_Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060958324/diesekoschmar-20)
was the first book I took myself too seriously for reading.  I made a
show of my profundity by ostentaciously reading it at Coffee Call, café
intelligent women were known to frequent.  Of course, intelligent women
didn't actually frequent it ... and if they had, none worthy of the
adjective would've flown to the Pirsig fan.  They would have laughed.The women most likely—statistically speaking—to have laughed at this
preening high school junior worked at the chocolateer across the
mall-way.  Future biographers (and lonely, pretentious bachelors)
should take note: one such women would eventually marry me.
*   I considered _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_ the
first "intellectual" book I'd ever read despite having spent every
Christmas break since I'd had two digits to my age re-reading _Moby Dick_.You need no longer imagine the depths of my stupidity.  My routine, for
those interested, consisted of looking out my window to see whether it
was raining again (it was); sticking my hand out the front door to see
whether the rain stung (it did); trying to squeeze in a few hours of
Nintendo before the downpour killed the power (inevitable); filching a
bag of Christmas-colored, sprinkle-covered chocolate chips from the
cookie jar (easy); lighting enough candles to read by but not so many
as to set off the smoke detectors (tricky); and reading _Moby Dick_ to
the sound of driving rain, by the Goldilocks o' candle light and with a
bowl of stolen holiday confections on my lap (priceless).

**The Entirely Unintellectual**

*   I won't be posting tomorrow because I'll be watching the Mets
fulfill my wildest dreams ... by which I mean 1) clinching a spot in
the next round of the playoffs or 2) not clinching so that I might
watch them clinch it on Sunday.*   Two nights ago, I was up until 4 a.m. reading _The Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience_, _Current Opinion in Neurobiology_ and
the like.  Tonight, I notice the clock says 1:45 a.m. and I'm watching
stuff about mounting next generation subwoofers in the center console
and building a mobile office in a trunk.  As much as I hate to say it,
I'm a fan of the "How Things Work" genre.  Give me an hour on the
Discovery Channel about how analgesics work and I'm a happy man.  You
want to [deconstruct the house of the future](http://science.discovery.com/convergence/deconstruction/future/future.html)?  I'm your man. *   By which I mean, I'll watch professionals do anything.  Hire a
carpenter and I'll stand over his shoulder making him uncomfortable.The plumber?  He better not mind showing me how to do whatever the hell
he's doing under there.  Sure, it's a tight fit ... but that doesn't
mean he can't give a blow-by-blow account of what's happening. 

Who am I tagging?  No one.  I want someone to surprise me.  At least
one person, but six would be great.  So one of you lurkers take up the
task and send me a trackback.  I'll gladly share my traffic to get to
know y'all better.

Psst! Check your spelling in the second sentence. 

You probably didn't come across [the few bits and pieces](http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/lo/people/gregor/cop\_529.pdf) I've had published in one of the neuroscience journals you've been reading. But then that doesn't really matter. They're 6 years old now, so they're hardly current any more. In fact, it was so long ago, that I hardly remember which bits I wrote myself!

In my defense, I hadn't meant to publish that, but save it as a draft.  _C'est la vie_.  I hadn't run across that article, as I've been focusing on 2003-2006 material.  (Not that I'm necessarily the best person to judge, mind you: it takes me hours to read through and make sense of the articles.)  I'll check out yours tonight or tomorrow, as I'm going to misbehave and spend the day personally collecting data for The Center for the Study of the Positioning of David Wright Relative to the Third Base Line.

I wrote up a response to this but it was deemed by the GF _declassé_ (sp?), on account of I apparently felt it was appropriate to provide a kind of rudimentary statistical analysis of the set of women with whom I've copulated or otherwise been intimate. She's not wrong, it was total bullshit. (I'm dating _up_, along a number of axes. Mustn't mess this one up.) Don't want you to think this post is just...dangling there, unanswered.

When I learn the importance of taste and restraint I'll finally post it and diddle the Trackback organ, no question. But as per 'taste' and 'restraint' concerns I won't use the word 'diddle' when I do.

I eagerly await your unwise diddlings.
