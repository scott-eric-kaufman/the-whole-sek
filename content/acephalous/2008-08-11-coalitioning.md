## Coalitioning?

So I’m
mini-hiatus bound — dissertation to be “finished” this week, whatever
that means — but I’ve run face-first into a vocabularian’s nightmare. 
I need to talk about disparate political interests uniting under a
common banner _a la_ the Republican Party, but because I can’t
slip into German I’m hard-pressed to find a verb that adequately
accounts for “the processual quality of coming together for pragmatic
political reasons.”

The word I need is “coalitioning,” but that’s not a word so much as a monstrosity.  The root of “coalition” is “coalesce,” _i.e._
“to cause to grow together, to unite, combine.”  Only “coalesce”
doesn’t connote the unhardy politics of “coalition” my argument
requires.

I think I’m stuck re-verbing a previously nouned verb to get my
point across.  Next thing you know, I’ll be redeconstructionating the
phallologodiscursive elementalariness of _das Ding_ and then why haven’t you shot me already yet?

Suggestions as to how I might forestall death please?

I think that you ought to give up on this Quixotic one-word dream of yours and embrace the luxurious convenience known as the verb phrase.  I would suggest something like "forming a strategic political alliance."  The advantage of "alliance" as the last word is that you could then move it into verb form in later sentences, having already specified what sort of alliance/coalition you are describing.

Big-Tenting?

Cynically Merging?

Israeli-style political maneuvering?

I think JPool's right: you need more than a single verb.

The term "coalition building" is actually in common usage in exactly this sense.  The -ing kind of gives you the processual aspect.  Somehow I think you must have already considered and rejected this solution for some reason, because it is a fairly obvious one.

How about describing them as "disparate political interests uniting under a common banner"?

Don't mean to be cute, but I'm not much of a writer, really, and so I usually have the best luck just saying exactly what I mean...

Laclau and Mouffe call it "articulating," as in the articulation of a set of train cars into a train.  But when they write of articulation, they are more talking about the discursive formation of such a coalition.  But I like their idea because articulation always makes me think of trains and I love the sound of trains.

See _The Federalist_, specifically #10 (breaking and controlling the violence of faction by expanding the sphere).

Aggregation, aggregating?

FTR, "coalition building" fit the bill.  Of course, now I'm obsessing over whether I ought to hyphenate it, but if it's not one mini-crisis, it's another, no?
