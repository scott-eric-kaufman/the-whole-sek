What can I say?  I want to be like [Mike](http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php).

On to the show!  I can't contest Matt's claim that the introduction to _Theory's Empire_ declares the timeliness, nay! necessity of an anti-_Norton_ anthology with a bombast the articles it introduces can't support.  But what about the introduction to _The Norton_?  Are its sins of inflation as grievous as _Theory's Empire_'s?  On the first page, students learn:
[Theory] entails a mode of questioning and analysis that goes beyond the earlier New Critical research into the "literariness" of literature.  Because of the effects of post-structuralism, cultural studies, and the new social movements, especially the women's and civil rights movements, theory now entails skepticism toward systems, institutions, and norms; a readiness to take critical stands and to engage in resistance; an interest in blind spots, contradictions, and distortions (often discovered to be ineradicable); and a habit of linking local and personal practices to the larger economic, political, historical, and ethical forces of culture.

Observe how the uncredited author (I'll call him/her "Andy") of the preface forces the students to make a distinction: on the one hand, there are the limited claims of the New Critics who focus solely on the "literariness of literature."  Apparently Andy never read _[I'll Take My Stand](http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA01/White/anthology/agrarian.html)_, the New Critical/Agrarian manifesto whose authors aren't interested in the literariness of literature so much as attacking "apologists of industrialism."  Denude the early anti-capitalist dimension to early New Critical thought and the rationale behind their theories concerning coherent aesthetic experiences seem awful small-minded.  That said, I won't claim the agrarian movement imagined itself to be progressive; then again, many of their complaints about the excesses of capitalism can still circulate in theoretical debates today:
The word science has acquired a certain sanctitude. It is out of order
to quarrel with science in the abstract, or even with the applied
sciences when their applications are made subject to criticism and
intelligence. The capitalization of the applied sciences has now become
extravagant and uncritical; it has enslaved our human energies to a
degree now clearly felt to be burdensome. The apologists of
industrialism do not like to meet this charge directly; so they often
take refuge in saying that they are devoted simply to science! They are
really devoted to the applied sciences and to practical production.
Therefore, it is necessary to employ a certain skepticism even at the
expense of the Cult of Science, and to say, it is an Americanism, which
look innocent and disinterested, but really is not either.

As a younger lad I fought to connect this strain of agrarian anti-industrialism to the contemporary critiques of capitalism.  Although I never quite accomplished that feat, to this day I wonder what those who oppose capitalism on theoretical grounds imagine will happen were they their opposition magically transformed into something, I don't know, remotely efficacious.  Would their vision of unalienated labor resemble that of the New Critics Andy casually dismisses in a clause?  In other words: if forced to articulate a positive program, what would it look like?  

It bothers me that literary critics can establish careers on an oppositional position without ever having to think through the implications of their arguments.  It reminds me too much of Socialists, Communists and Stalinists in the 1920s who, unlike the anti-Stalinist Socialists, chose to ignore evidence of the purges so that they might continue to fight the good fight in the hallways of Harvard and Columbia.  That's unfair.  (And also intrudes on David Horowitz's lunatic territory.  However, I have a point; he has a jeremiad.)  My point is simply that much of what passes for "Theory" in literature departments stake a wholly oppositional claim, one which never demands a positive platform, because for more than 25 years they haven't been forced to think through what their position entails.  [They should be](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/theorys\_empire\_ersatz\_theoretical\_ecumenicalism\_criticism\_qua\_criticism/).

I've been on the verge of "the other hand" for some time now.  Here it is:

On the other hand, after aligning contemporary "theory" with the women's and civil rights movements that everyone with a smattering of history (_i.e._ not our students) knows preceded it by at least a decade, Andy announces theory's sole ownership of "skepticism towards systems, institutions, and norms."  It's also cornered the market on critical stands and engagements in resistance.  What Andy's done is deny the New Critics their day in the oppositional sun and trumpeted the power of theory.  But wait!  I'm a liar!  I havent' even reached the introduction yet: all of this information and obfuscation's actually in the Preface!

Tomorrow I will stop lying and discuss the introduction, which merits its own discussion.  My point here, as I think will become increasingly clear on the morrow, is that Matt's correct: there's a real problem with the introduction to _Theory's Empire_.  But though I agree, I will expand his argument to encompass the genre of introductions, and I'll demand he read the essays in _Theory's Empire_ instead of the terrible introduction.  I will insist that he carefully read my contribution to the event (linked to above, around, and all over the place), and ask him whether he thinks I'm being unfair to the claims of theorists.  

(I will then apologize to Matt for forcing him to read a really long essay by demanding he do so in a public venue.  Then I'll concede that my tactics were cheap but I really think he should see whether I'm attacking Theory _qua_, um, theory?  Theory?)
