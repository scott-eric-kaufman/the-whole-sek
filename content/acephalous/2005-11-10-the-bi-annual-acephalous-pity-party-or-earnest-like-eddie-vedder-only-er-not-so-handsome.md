## The Bi-Annual Acephalous Pity Party; or, Earnest like Eddie Vedder only, er, Not So Handsome

So you've exhausted your funding.  After the Spring quarter of this year, despite the fact that you're a dedicated teacher who _wants_ to teach, you will find yourself without a position in the institution you've dedicated the past 5 years of your life to.  More to the point, you'll find yourself unable to continue refining [the program](http://www.humanities.uci.edu/litjourn/) you've invested the past two years of your life in.  Not that the program's chair doesn't want you to.  He'd love nothing more to employ you so that he doesn't have to fret over the new students and instructors every year.  He feels more comfortable with you teaching and advising the new teachers . . . so comfortable, in fact, that he can focus without guilt on his upper division classes because he knows you have the lower division classes covered.  But here's the thing:

Normative time to finishing a dissertation is six years.  If I'm still here in the Fall of 2006, that'll be my seventh year in the program.  Normally, I'm not the type to complain.  After all, I spent the Fall, Winter and Spring quarters of last year as a T.A. for 1) my advisor (Fall), 2) the chair of the Literary Journalism department (Winter) and 3) my own section Intro. to Literary Journalism (Spring) . . . all the while spending my "days off" at the hospital undergoing chemotherapy.  See what I mean?  I toughed it out.  I didn't tell anyone a damn thing or take a leave of absence . . . and now I realize I should have.  

I should have told everyone every damn thing.  

I should have taken a leave of absence.  

Do you know how much work you can accomplish when on the days you don't teach you're dosed with an ever-changing array of chemicals which kill cancer cells but also convince your immune system to summer in Tahiti?  

None.  

Maybe not "none," but certainly "less than expected."  In retrospect, as my advisor (who has been nothing short of gracious about the entire affair) informed me, I should've taken a leave of absence.  I should've extended the time in which I work on my dissertation while teaching another year.  Now I face the prospect of a year without teaching . . . a year in which I'll do nothing but research and live off the wife's slim salary.  (Money's not an object.  To call me "frugal" would be an understatement.  I'm a Jew, er, "Jew."  We have savings.)  What I fear isn't the lack of income but the lack of intellectual stimulation.  I fear that if I'm not forced to bandy my ideas in something resembling a public sphere that they'll cement themselves in their current, untested forms.  So here's the radical proposition I'm considering:

I have a number of regular readers whose intelligence I respect immensely.  A few of you have already stepped to the plate and offered to read my dissertation—and for that I am most grateful—but I want to open this up to all interested parties.  Come December 1st, I'll have three chapters completed.  I would be forever in your debt if you'd read and criticize them.  I need outside impetus to finish this thing, to not wallow in the fallows of my compromised immune system—Two _different_ colds and bronchitis in a two week span?—and get my work done.  I'd love your feedback, but I can't do much more than ask.  

That said, as soon as I cough this shit out of my lungs I'll be my normal acerbic self again.  Have no worries.  As soon as I stop coughing I'll amuse you again.  I promise.

Although this is obvious and something you probably already know, you might want to screen very carefully who gets to read those chapters.  There are a lot of intellectually-dishonest wing-nuts out there.

But as you know, I'll be happy to read anything you write (especially since you've already read a good chunk of my diss.)

I could read a chapter or three.  I also recommend trying to get on conference panels where you could try out the ideas for the remaining chapter(s).  Doing a 15 page precis of a chapter makes writing the chapter itself a whole lot easier.  

BTW: Can't you get any adjunct teaching around your area?  I'm like you: I need to teach in order to think and write.  That's why I'm stupidly teaching as part of my fellowship, adjuncting at a local university, going on the job market, applying for jobs at private high schools, and trying to finish my Morrison chapter.  Fun fun.

I'd love to read a few chapters of your dissertation and comment on them. You should realize, though, that in a year and a half from now, when I find myself in this same situation, I expect you to do the same :). 

I want to second Stephens advice as well. It wasn't that long ago that I read an article at the Chronicle of Higher Education about a new professor that emailed her dissertation to a grad student (supposedly for the student's research), and the grad student PLAGAIRIZED THE ENTIRE THING for his own dissertation. 

I'd say that there are a lot of intellectually dishonest people of all stripes out there.

I somehow don't think that Scott has much to worry about in terms of plagairism -- rarely has a not-yet-written thesis been so Googlable, I'm guessing.

I'll read the thing too, if you want.  I'd be tempted to pull a Kevin and ask you to read some of my poetry in exchange, but I think that is a trend that you don't want to start.

I'd be happy to be one of your readers, Scott.
