## Your Daily Irony*

My comments on [my article](http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/11/01/kaufman) on _Inside Higher Ed_ didn't muster past moderation.  I can only assume my vicious indictments of my own position—I tore myself a few new ones and then some—are responsible for this stolid display of commonsense.  But I wish my responses to [Jason](http://www.middlebrow.net/), [A.G.](http://moodeuce.blogspot.com/), [Drew](http://off-center.tatuskofam.com/) and [Jonathan](http://www.froginawell.net/japan/) had hit daylight, as I didn't save them and can't remember what I'd written.  I suppose I _could_ write something else entirely ...

\*This implies I do this daily.  I don't.  My life is rather unironic.

I still like your point about learning to write for an audience. I feel like I'm writing my dissertation to the void right now.

No, no, no, you're not writing it into a void anymore.  I've been enjoying your blow-by-blow account your introduction, and am drafting a post in response to some of the issues you've raised ... I'm just waiting until you're finished to hit "Publish."

You might try contacting the powers-that-be at IHE: I've had messages get stuck in their moderation queue that they managed to liberate. It's possible that your responses are indeed gone forever, but give them one more chance....

We'll now I'm more motivated to finish the intro and put it up, even in its rough and ugly form. I would welcome your feedback. Especially since we're writing about some of the same people, though I don't really focus on evolutionary theory.

I'd say the chance your comment was rejected -- as opposed to just being eaten by a technical glitch perhaps -- is incredibly slight. Unless you, like, threatened to kill someone.

This is my personal estimate of the situation and does not reflect the opinions of Inside Higher Ed, its editors, advertisers, or whatnot. But c'mon, it's clear that the bar for comments is pretty low. Let a hundred flowers bloom, etc. 

There are demented old fuckwits who, if not for posting in the IHE comments section five times a day, would be out in public, behind the wheels of automobiles, running over people they thought looked like Ward Churchill. I'd prefer to think we are saving lives.

Now _this_ is brilliant. You have made me suddenly appreciate news site comment sections.

you have to admit though that Ward Churchill does look a bit like a person who would be worth running over? politics aside, that haircut he had going during the late weeks of his CU controversy did not make him too many friends...

Nice article, if only to confirm the archival curiosity that is the blog. Does seem to offer a modicum of hope about the format -- then again, people actually read your  blog. ;)
