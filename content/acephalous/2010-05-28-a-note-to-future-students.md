Yeah, I had a student do this once. Then when he got a D he came and moaned about it. Had a sob story about needing to pass or his acceptance to law school would be rescinded or something. Kids these days.

It's odd to watch the pass from professors "knowing" you did the paper in one night to actually knowing and being able to comment on. I never had Facebook so the closest I came was in a thesis on utopias in comics, senior year, when the profs in the English department knew my work habits.

I hand the paper in, ragged and bloodshot. 

Prof: So, how did it turn out?  

Me: I'm not sure...I didn't turn out how I originally planned, but I think it works.  

Prof: That's why we proofread  

(beat, we look each other in the eye, then both break out laughing.)

I feel old.

In my time, it was sending an e-mail at 4am to my advisor. 

I only did it once. I learned my lesson. Afterwards, I would work until 5 am, set the alarm at 9, send the message, and go back to sleep.

I should've added: that's a former student, not a current one.  I just happened to be up at 3 a.m. to witness his confession.

I have had exactly this experience with students.  I find it more funny than anything else.

Sadly, it seemed almost axiomatic in college that the closer to the deadline that I started a paper, and the more caffiene-addled cold sweat frenzy in which I wrote it, the better the grade.

This was not a happy discover for my psyche or my kidneys.

Oh god, yes. There were the papers I agonized over for weeks and got lukewarm responses to, and then there was the one on Marx I started 3 hours before it was due and got glowing praise about how insightful it was. (Probably because I didn't have time to do any real thinking, and just wrote things similar to what the professor said in class. "Insight" means "agrees with me", apparently.) This is probably why I mostly stuck with classes with problem sets instead of papers.

I never, ever, ever put something in a paper just because I thought it was what the professor wanted to hear. I wouldn't think to do something like that. But I have heard this kind of thing from lots of people, including people I respect. I guess I always got sufficiently socialized (reprogrammed?) into the topic during the course of a semester that I came to believe that, within the context of that class, such statements were accurate representations of what was correct. Maybe that's the same thing? It seems like Onymous is confessing to a sin of insincerity for which I feel no similar guilt. But I don't mind changing my mind later on...

As for the inverse relation between grade and effort... I also noticed it in my own undergraduate coursework. The more I relaxed and blew off the class, then wrote madly for one night (for one paper in Interpersonal Communication, 27 pages in 8 hours), the better the grade, while I would do actual research and sweat out questions and weigh evidence in my lit courses, and get killed by the professor.

Now that I'm teaching, I've found that I'm much more successful in teaching topics about which I know very little. I can blithely state "the truth" on some topic in clear and easily recalled language, with absolute, authoritative statements. When I'm teaching about a topic that I'm very familiar with, I hedge all my statements, offer counter evidence, carefully and creatively treat each little argument with great attention, such that the students end up being thoroughly confused.

I like to delude myself that I wasn't getting better grades on the cold-sweat papers just because I was flattering the professors, but hell -- it's not like I can _remember_ writing any of them.

(Caffiene is a hell of a drug.)

JPRS, the second one is the one that sounds like a better teaching style...

Well, I got an email the other night from a student asking about topic selections; she had the wrong period, she had no idea of anything more specific than that, the paper's due this Thursday, and she's writing it in a foreign language (she's Korean, like most of my students), which makes it roughly equivalent (probably 3 days before would be closer, but she's also probably cram studying for nine other classes, with all exams happening in the next 3 days or so). 

I do tend not to accept the Friend requests from current students, though once they've graduated, it's okay. Thing is, over here they tend to gossip a LOT more about their "foreign profs."

And, Nutellaontoast, the second one sounds better to us, but I suspect a lot of people prefer the former. :(
