## Se Concevoir Autrement Que L'on N'est; ou C'est Vrai! C'est Vrai! Je Parle Francais Un Peu!

[_Note to you know who you are: I eventually tie this back the work of Gene Wolfe._]

That title smoothly translates as "to conceive oneself other than one is" and is the foundation of a _fin de siècle_ philosophical fad known as _bovarysme_.  Most students of the humanities encounter _bovarysme_ (if they encounter it at all) in T.S. Eliot's "Shakespeare and the Stoicism of Seneca."  Eliot argues that Othello "succeeds in turning
himself into a pathetic figure, by adopting an _aesthetic_ 
rather than a moral attitude, dramatising himself against his
environment."  He doesn't "believe that any writer has ever exposed this
_bovarysme_, the human will to see things as they are not, more clearly
than Shakespeare."  Hannah Arendt would disagree.  In _Eichmann in Jerusalem_ (1963) she notes how rare it is
to find documents in which such bald words as
"extermination," "liquidation," or "killing" occur. The prescribed code
names for killing were "final solution," "evacuation" (_Aussiedlung_ ), and "special treatment" (_Sonderbehandlung_).

This language sounds euphemistic for good reason.  Because we _want_ Nazis to be responsible for the Holocaust we _must_ read them as being euphemisms.  If they aren't euphemisms—if the average Nazi _believed_ that he was implementing "the final solution" instead of ordering an "extermination"—then their culpability can be questioned.  The state _bovarysme_ describes is one of complete mystification.  The victims of the so-called will-to-illusion never see the despoiled forest for the haggard trees.  Or even the haggard trees.  They see fields of blooming poppies just begging for a good hard frolicking.  They see puppies prancing with kittens cavorting with bunnies bouncing alongside wee little chicks.  Such people aren't (and can't be) culpable in the way we want Eichmann culpable.  

The extent of self-deception exonerates the _bovaryste_ of serial euphemism.  What prevents _bovarysme_ from being incorporated into a more thoroughgoing conception of ideology?  The mystification of the _bovaryste_ may be as powerful as any ideological mystification this side of the faded and flagging Iron Curtain, but it lacks the systemic kick of old school ideological interpellation (sans Lacan).  What fascinates me about this particular fashionable philosophical position is that it appeals to anyone who wants to fool themselves so thoroughly as to forget they've ever fooled themselves of anything.  They believe the lie not because they want to _but because they've forgotten they lied to themselves._ Why do I mention this tonight?  Do I have some political point I'm desperate to make?

No.  I mention it because Jonathan and Rich were having [a fascinating discussion about the merits of Gene Wolfe](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/on\_terrible\_neo.html#comments) and I wanted to feel like a contributer to this blog.  Since I haven't read the novels they're discussing in [more than five years](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/a\_very\_unfunny\_.html) I felt I could best contribute by pointing out the aspect of Wolfe's _The Fifth Head of Cerberus_ I found most fascinating aligns neatly with a turn-of-the-century philosophical fad I also find fascinating.  Kind of anti-climatic ain't it?

Do you mean "(sans Althusser)"?

I suppose I meant "(sans Lacan by way of sans Althusser)," but I'm a sucker for assonance...and there _is_ a way in which interpellation minus Lacan approximates commonplace ideological mystification.  Plus I'd already said "mystification" twice and desperately needed another word and, having run plum out of 'em, I grasped for interpellation and qualifed.  I suppose "san Althusser" could work, but there's something plainer and more inaccurate about the sweet musicality of "sans Lacan."

That said, you didn't correct me on my French, which means those eight years _weren't wasted_ thank-you-very-much-Madame-LaFleur!

I was particularly impressed with the pleonastic "ne" (or "n'" as it appears here).
