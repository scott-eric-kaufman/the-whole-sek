[Irony is delicious](http://patterico.com/2008/09/10/nyt-story-mentioning-obama-ayers-and-chicago-annenberg-challenge-all-lost-in-a-sea-of-lipstick-coverage/).  WLS is upset because one manufactured scandal drowned out the _The New York Times_’s coverage of the most important [unreported](http://patterico.com/2008/08/25/bill-ayers-friends/) [story](http://patterico.com/2008/09/09/quote-of-the-day-bill-ayers/) ever.  If [you’re](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13178) [of the](http://globallabor.blogspot.com/) [opinion](http://patterico.com/2008/08/21/a-very-interesting-and-potentially-devastating-story-about-obama-and-terrorist-bill-ayers-is-beginning-to-percolate/) that the McCain campaign is overstuffed with tactical geniuses
dedicated to sitting on the sordid tale of the Annenberg Challenge
until closer to the election, listen up, because I’m about to tell a
story.

		

					[]()
			

It begins, as Tom Maguire [writes](http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/obama-ayers-and-the-annenberg-challenge-cover-up/2/),
“[a]t a White House event with Bill Clinton [where] philanthropist
Walter Annenberg announced that he was making a $500 million grant to
cities across the nation to put towards public school reform.”  The
intrigue and perfidy originate, as does everything currently wrong with
the country, with Bill Clinton and a leftist billionaire cast in the
Soros mold.  Bill Ayers, former WU terrorist and Annenberg’s
brother-in-ideology, requested and received $50 million for urban
enrichment programs which would, in accordance with the core beliefs of
all involved, function as [leftist indoctrination camps](http://patterico.com/2008/09/10/nyt-story-mentioning-obama-ayers-and-chicago-annenberg-challenge-all-lost-in-a-sea-of-lipstick-coverage/). 
While much is known and reviled about Ayers and his personal choice to
chair the Chicago Annenberg Challenge’s board, Barack Obama, relatively
little attention has been paid to their benefactor—the man who
personally approved Ayers’s $150 million plan to put the _Che_ back in
_Chicago_—Walter Annenberg.

Annenberg arrived on the national scene when he and his father,
Philadelphia publisher Moses “Moe” Annenberg, were charged with evading
$3,258,809 in income taxes.  Although based in Philadelphia, the
Annenberg clan’s ties with the Chicago political machine were already
well-established: his co-defendants included “James M. Ragen Sr.,
Chicago, former general manager of Nation-wide News Service, Inc.;
James M. Ragen Jr., Chicago, son of the Nation-wide general manager;
Charles W. Bidwill, Chicago, head of a printing company and owner of
the Chicago Cardinals, professional football club; [and] Herbert S.
Kamin, Chicago.”[[1]](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/breaking-news-o.html/#1)

His father was successfully prosecuted, but Walter avoided
jail-time.  He spent the better part of the next decade in a manner
befitting a billionaire wastrel: rubbing shoulders with the Hollywood
elite.[[2]](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/breaking-news-o.html/#2)
When he assumed control of his father’s publishing empire after Moses’s
death in 1952, Annenberg used those Hollywood connections to start a
little magazine called _TV Guide_.

Under his stewardship, Triangle Publications waged war against conservative American values from the pages of _Seventeen_ to the stages of _American Bandstand_.  As the 1952 election neared, he   hosted countless fundraisers for the first “[eggheaded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egghead)”
political neophyte from Illinois whose Presidential aspirations were
dashed by a humble war hero: Adlai Stevenson.  At an exclusive Malibu
Beach estate, the _Los Angeles Times_ reported, Annenberg
convened “[m]ore than 40 State and national Republican Party leaders
[for] dinner with Sen. Nixon, who flew [there] from Denver to meet with
them.”[[3]](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/breaking-news-o.html/#3).

_That doesn’t sound_—never mind.  Even hard-core communist sympathizers can have a day of clarity.  Annenberg’s solstice of sanity
ended with a winter chill.  As the end of Eisenhower’s second term
neared, the Kennedy clan courted the powerful publisher’s for support
in the 1960 elections: “Vice-President and Mrs. Nixon were hosts at a
small dinner party in their Forest Lane home last night to Mr. and Mrs.
Norman Chandler and Mr. and Mrs. Otis Chandler[;] Mr. and Mrs. Walter
Annenberg; [and] British Ambassador Sir Harold Caccia.”[[4]](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/breaking-news-o.html/#4).

_Now wait one minute_—why’s the financial backer of Ayer’s
“enrichment” camps dining with Nixon and British Ambassadors on the eve
of an election?  Soviet [COINTELPRO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO)? We’re talking about the man who green-lit Howard K. Smith’s 1959 hit-piece, “The Political Obiturary of Richard M. Nixon”:

[T]wo stations, WNHC-TV in New Haven and WFIL-TV in
Philadelphia . . . blacked out not only the original telecast but even
a reference to the program in a straight news report 24 hours later[.] 
The owner of the outlets, Walter Annenberg . . . could have readily
added an editorial footnote disagreeing with the program without going
to the extreme measure of total suppression.[[5]](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/breaking-news-o.html/#5)

_The fuck_?  This is the same Arab-loving Annenberg whose papers slandered the Israelis at the outset of the [Six-Day War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day\_War), claiming the deaths of three Israel soldiers on November 11

th

 had been faked as a pretext to send 4,000 heavily-armed soldiers into a town of 3,000, [as-Samu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Es\_Samu), in order to secure water for the nearby settlements of Ma’on and Asa’el.  As M.S. Handler wrote in _The New York Times_: “Walter Annenberg, publisher of _The Philadelphia Inquirer_, was reported by his   newspaper to have contributed $1 million.”[[6]](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/breaking-news-o.html/#6) His own newspaper reported that he donated an inflation-adjusted **$6,928,926.20 million** to the United Jewish Appeal’s Israel Emergency Fund—_what_?

_Shut up_.  Annenberg approved Ayers’s grant application.  He hears
capitalism’s death-rattle.  He thinks the New Deal proves Marx correct
about socialism being a stepping stone to capitalism.  He and his
friends finance the overthrow of the American government.  Remember
Norman Chandler, Annenberg’s co-conspirator in the communist plot to
infiltrate Nixon’s dining room?  Raping the American way of life _to death_
is the first thing he thinks about in the morning and the last thing he
thinks about night.  Like Annenberg, he hires inexperienced college
kids to run multi-billion dollar enterprises into the ground:

Norman Chandler, chairman and chief executive officer
[of Times Mirror Co.], announced Wednesday [that] Walter H. Annenberg,
president of Triangle Publications, Inc., was elected a director of
Times Mirror at the company’s board meeting . . . Annenberg is also a
director of Campbell Soup Co., the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. and Girard
Trust Bank.[[7]](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/breaking-news-o.html/#7)

_Just hold those horses_—Obama’s an acolyte of an anti-American
_terrorist_ funded by Annenberg.  Annenberg supports terrorism.  He’s not
a close personal friend of GOP elite.

A Nixon spokesman described [them] as the two families’   closest and most personal friends.

According to _The New York Times_ article about the plan to secure a truce between rival factions the heathen way—_i.e._
by exploiting the sacred bond of marriage for crass political ends—the
“two families” in question were the Husseins and al-Sauds.

Former President Eisenhower’s only grandson, Dwight
David Eisenhower, and President-elect Richard M. Nixon’s younger
daughter, Julie, were married yesterday . . .

But Annenberg wasn’t there.  He was out aiding and abetting peace-loving—

. . . at a dignified ceremony with Quaker touches.

They were superficial!

Julie, who considers herself a Quaker, asked Dr. Peale
and her bridegroom to use the Quaker “thee” and “thou” throughout the
service.

SUPERFICIAL!  Besides, what has this got to do with the man behind the terrorist behind Obama?

Guests included Walter Annen—

UNDER DURESS so he could experience FREEDOM first-hand!

—berg, the Philadelphia Publisher at whose—

—MARXIST INDOCTRINATION FACILITY WHERE AYERS TAUGHT OBAMA HOW TO BEHEAD AMERI—

—at whose Palm Springs, California house Mr. Nixon—

—WAS THREATENED WITH CASTRATION IF HE DIDN’T RENOUNCE FREED—

—during the recent Republican Governors’ Conference.[[8]](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/breaking-news-o.html/#8)

DON’T POINT THOSE CITATIONS AT ME!  ANNENBERG IS AYERS IS OBAMA!  HE IS   AN EMBODIMENT OF HATRED OF THE AMERICAN DRE—

Walter Annenberg’s 200-acre Palm Springs enclosure includes   his own 18-hole golf course.[[9]](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/breaking-news-o.html/#9)

HE WOULD’VE STRANGLED SAINT RONALD WITH HIS BARE HANDS IF HE HAD THE CHANCE!

I wonder if there's any way to harness the energy released when people's heads explode?

Let's see: I'll do my usual thing with Scott's political posts of "float over the links".  Patterico, patterico, proteinwisdom, yawn ... looks like Scott is blowing up barrels with artillery shells again ... wait, globallabor.blogspot.com?  Which is when I click through and see Steve Diamond, the guy who claims to be a union advisor yet writes nothing but piece after piece about how Obama is controlled by the Authoritarian Left.  Cool!  It's like seeing Hitchens when he first found out that the Clintons were going into politics.  Or [Bill Nierenberg](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article4690900.ece) when he was inventing global warming denialism in 1983.

_He thinks the New Deal proves Marx correct about socialism being a stepping stone to capitalism._

There's something wrong with this sentence, but I'm not _entirely_ sure what.

Ahistoricality, I believe that Cronenberg (1981) explores issues related to this suggestion.

The problem is that it's not Annenberg's character at issue here.  It's Obama's.  And it's quite easy to tar Obama with Ayers's criminal actions.  (I mean, Ayers would have been jailed for a long time had the FBI not fucked up their investigation of the WU.)

Clearly, Ayers has changed; it's been years since he helped build bombs and blew shit up.  But Obama is gonna catch a beating for his association with Ayers.  We can complain that Ayers is funded now by conservative quadrillionaires, but I can already see the populace falling asleep before that justification is half articulated.  

Sadly, the only way to stop this sort of bullshit politics is the tu quoque.  So we have to find McCain saying "lipstick on a pig" to excuse Obama, or we have to point to Obama to excuse Palin's lack of experience.  The only way the Ayers story will stop snowballing is if we can attach McCain to some similarly dastardly character.

Nah, the Ayers story is already stopped, Luther.  The way these things work, you get one chance to introduce the smear.  If it doesn't snowball after that, the media view it as already having been introduced, and that's it.  Ayers is now old news.

That's why McCain has been going after increasingly obvious lies such as the "Obama wants to teach kindergardeners about sex" one.  They already shot their best material.  They can't go back to it now.

Rich: Basically true, though it obviously resets every four years or something because Alan Keyes tried the exact same sex ed lie against Obama in the Senate race.

Yeah, Tomemos, it's once per race, or more accurately once per media universe (i.e. you can use it locally, then statewide, then nationally).  The only source of stories for the media is what the campaigns put out, but they have this dim ancestral memory of when they used to break stories, so they only go after new ones that their buddies haven't already talked about.
