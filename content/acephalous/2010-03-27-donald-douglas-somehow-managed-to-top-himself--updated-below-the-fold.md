## Donald Douglas somehow managed to top himself. [<em>Updated below the fold.</em>]

But honestly, because he’s proven it’s possible to be gainfully 
employed in academia _and_ functionally illiterate, I can’t even 
manage a few moments of _schadenfreude_.  Remember that [post](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/03/shorter-jeff-goldstein)
 I wrote yesterday?  The one in which I clearly indicated that I’d 
condensed a thread’s worth of insults into a nonsensical stream of _ad
 hominem_?

Donald Douglas not only thinks Jeff Goldstein wrote it, he [considers
 it](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/raping-lady-liberty.html) to be a “deliciously devastating slam.”  I’ll take the 
compliment on its face—the art of collage _is_ an art—but the 
fact that someone employed by an institution of higher learning found 
that paragraph compelling is, I think we can all agree, probably the 
most embarrassing thing someone employed by an institution of higher 
learning could ever do. The only reasonable response to such a brazen 
display of idiocy is to take a screen-shot of it and put it on the 
internet forever:

**Update.** Somehow,
 I always forget that when it comes to missing the point, Douglas will 
never be topped.  He composed a "[refutation](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/scott-eric-kaufman-self-hating-skankwad.html)"
 of this post in which he admits his error as only he can:

The gist of the attack is that somehow I'm functionally 
illiterate:

_Because he’s proven it’s possible to be gainfully employed in 
academia and functionally illiterate, I can’t even manage a few moments
 of schadenfreude_.

Sure, to be fair to Skanky Little Scotty, my bad. I could have sworn 
that was Jeff's comments at the post, "[Shorter
 Jeff Goldstein](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/03/shorter-jeff-goldstein/)." Chalk one up for the Big Bad Boys at Lawyers, Gays
 and Marriage, where academic giants like Robert Fuckwad Farley [stiff
 good-faith conservatives for a thousand bucks](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2008/10/moral-abomination-of-robert-farley.html) while sucking back a 
few whiskey sours.

As a Cautious Man [noted](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/03/donald-douglas-somehow-managed-to-top-himself/comment-page-1#comment-38578)
 earlier, someone [is
 not aware of all internet traditions](http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2003/02/shorter-steven-den-beste-as-part-of-my.html); he is, however, attempting to
 start one of his own.  It lacks a catchy name like "Shorter," but that 
doesn't mean it doesn't deserve a place in the Hall of Internet 
Traditions.  It goes something like this:

1.  You demonstrate that Douglas has no idea what he's talking about.
2.  He responds by [correcting
 a typo](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/02/you-want-a-cylinder-of-fish-bits-because-i-can-bring-it).

I'm not kidding.  He responded to a post in which I demonstrated that
 he has _problems with basic comprehension_ by writing:
Little Scotty's schtick is to attack 
conservatives for bad writing and alleged "functional illiteracy" while 
 demonstrating—once again!—actual functional illiteracy.

His
 proof?  I mistyped "version" as "verion" in the "Shorter" post.  I hate
 to be pedantic, but since winding Douglas up is damn entertaining, I 
will: making a typographical error isn't evidence of "functional 
illiteracy," which Wikipedia [defines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional\_illiteracy) as
 "a term used to describe reading and writing skills that are inadequate
 to cope with the demands of everyday life," _e.g._ "reading blog 
posts if you're a blogger."  You're a blogger who _by his own 
admission_ is incapable of reading blog posts, meaning that by the 
power vested in me by Wikipedia, I am within my rights to hereby declare
 you to be "a functionally illiterate blogger."  See how that works?  
Of
 course you don't.  You think that because Goldstein uses variations of 
the word "fuck," it's reasonable for someone to assume that the 
paragraph in the original post was written by him.  By that logic, 
Goldstein also wrote what you said about Farley above—which would mean 
that you, sir, are a plagiarist.

I note that the liberals who are offended by the cartoon in question are a "nihilist insurgency." Because if you don't believe in the sanctity of cartoon rape, you believe in nothing.

Is ’self-said’ a word? I’ve heard of ’self-made’ and ’self-styled’ and ’so-called’ and ‘wannabee’ and ’self-proclaimed’ and ‘has-been’ and ‘one-time.’

SEK, I think you need to add something to your new meme:  

1. You demonstrate that Douglas has no idea what he’s talking about.  

2. He responds by correcting a typo _and issuing an illiterate neologism_  

Fixed.

(For the record) I found the paragraph in question to be quite compelling, a more-than-competently-executed example of distilled adaptation.  Like Paul Dini Batman.
