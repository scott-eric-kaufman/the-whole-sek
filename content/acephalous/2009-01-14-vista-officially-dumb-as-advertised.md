## Vista: officially dumb as advertised.

I initially agreed with Adam on Vista being [better than advertised](http://heteronomy.wordpress.com/2009/01/07/in-which-i-take-a-controversial-opinion/), but as I was lesson-planning Tuesday it started grinding to a halt.  It couldn't handle PowerPoint presentations.  (Not that I'm a fan of that either, but when you teach visual rhetoric, PowerPoint is preferable to the hold-on-while-I-forward-to-this-scene-style of wait-a-minute-I-wrote-down-19:23-style of where-did-it-go-style of teaching.)  Today it couldn't handle anything.  So I installed one of those programs that diagnoses what's wrong with your computer and discovered that Vista had _saved 45 gigs worth of backups of downloaded Windows updates._  

Heaven forfend we have to download them again.  Best to keep them all there _just in case_.  (And before anyone says it, I'm fiddling around with Ubuntu on my jerry-rigged laptop-thing.)

I'm happy to offer free Ubuntu help, if you need it.

If Vista isn't stable enough for my employer to roll out to company machines, then it isn't stable enough for my home use. Still on XP in both places. 

Microshaft finally ticked off a large enough segment of its user base, so Windows 7 is under development. 

[sarcasm] I can't imagine why. [/sarcasm]

So presumably Windows 95 was Windows 4.  Are we counting XP and Vista as 5 and 6?  It's hard to tell where you'd draw the full-number line among 95, 98, and XP, but wasn't XP the one that finally eliminated a real DOS mode?

_but wasn't XP the one that finally eliminated a real DOS mode_

Hmmm. Don't know. I used a command line pretty frequently when I ran XP, and still do on my system I run virtually. Does that count as a "real DOS mode"?

Don't forget Windows 2000 which is very stable and I'm still running on my last PC. I finally just said fuck it abot 4 years ago and have gone to macs. My rocket scientist wife still avoids the mac b/c of some unix thing I don't understand, but NASA uses Vista and 2000. Of course they treat PCs like I treat yellow pads, sort of like handy things to keep around until they get full or lost.

I share with Adam a belief that Windows 95/8 ran on a DOS kernel, while Windows XP simply allows you to use a DOS-style command line by running a DOS emulator in a virtual machine, but the relevant Wikipedia articles are a little confusing.

Windows 4 was 95. 4.5 was 98, ME was a mistake. Windows 2000 is Windows NT 4.0. XP is 5.0, Vista is 6.0.

_  I look at that and flashback to points in my life, sort of like hearing a tune from my youth. MS is pretty deep in my consciousness.
