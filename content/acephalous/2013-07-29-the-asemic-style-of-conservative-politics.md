As outlined in [the book of the same name](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006L7RJ6O/diesekoschmar-20),
 the paranoid style of American politics requires a philosophical rigor 
that contemporary conservatives simply lack. There’s a baroque grandeur 
to the pattern of perceived slights that’s admirable in its own way — as
 if a master archer decided to “paint” a [pointillist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointillism)
 self-portrait one arrow at a time. The style of contemporary 
conservatives is equally absurd, but it lacks the pointless beauty of 
paranoia — it’s akin to child who tosses a handful of bird shot into a 
lake and finds in the resulting ripples a fair resemblance of himself. 
By insisting his reflection is the result of his “artistry,” he 
communicates that he fundamentally misunderstands the nature of 
causality.

Put differently: if he pissed on a mirror he’d crow about the transmogrifying powers of his urine.

Because he’s not paranoid — _he’s an idiot_. He’s out there kicking a watch to prove to David Hume that God designed the world to exist. [At _The National Review_](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/354638/dueling-book-reviews-daniels-vs-obama-stanley-kurtz),
 for example, Stanley Kurtz recounts reading a book by James Kloppenberg
 in which Mike Kruglik “recalls that Obama had a special interest in the
 work of the radical historian Howard Zinn” _in 1985_. I had to 
add the date because Kurtz didn’t want to sully Kloppenberg’s account of
 Kruglik’s twenty-eight year old recollection of Obama’s “special 
interest” with its proper context. Had he done so, Paul Mirengoff of _Powerline_ wouldn’t have been able to draw attention to “[The Obama-Zinn Connection](http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2013/07/the-obama-zinn-connection.php),”
 nor would he have been able to transform Obama’s “special interest” 
into overt “fan[dom],” and if he couldn’t call Obama a “fan” of Zinn, he
 couldn’t link to _The National Review_‘s “[summar[y]](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/354614/mitch-daniels-was-right-editors)” of “Zinn’s errors and distortions.”

This isn’t paranoia — grandiose or otherwise — it’s the 
self-fulfilling stupidity of three kids kicking a turtle they’ve 
mistaken for a watch who think they’re proving God and Samuel Johnson 
right. They’re not exactly sure how they’ve done 
so, but they’re damn sure that they have _because it looks just like them_.

I dig watching someone write the fuck out of words.

Is the Obama-Zinn connection all that different of a desperate grab than the Obama-Ayers connection? Their being on the same board for the Woods Fund all the sudden translated into Obama being guilty by association for Weathermen activities. When he was a kid.
