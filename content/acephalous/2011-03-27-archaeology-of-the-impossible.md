## Archaeology of the Impossible

Given that I have all of _four days_ to wrap up the Winter quarter and vault into the Spring, lesson-planning's taken the bulk of my time of late.  I'm thinking, as per the tentative title of this post, of delving into meta-fictional accounts of the origin of comic "heroism" this quarter, and have come up with the following (largely other-side-of-the-pond) syllabus:

**"The Origin of Batman" (excerpt from _Batman_ 47) - Bob Kane**

You begin with the almost-begin: this is the first time Joe Chill's mentioned, by which I mean implicated, in the death of Wayne's parents.  There's an earlier reference to their murder in _Detective Comics_ 39 (November 1939), but it's abridged in a way that makes the story itself unrecognizable.  (Which is, yes, the very opposite of the point I make below about Morrison's _All-Star Superman_, but that's because you can't already assume an audience is familiar with a story before it's ever been told.)

**_Batman:  Year One_ (comic) - Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli**

See what I did  there?  In terms of comparative styles, now I can introduce _Asterios  Polyp_.  To wit, Mazzucchelli in _Year One_:

[![Batman year one](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3812052970b-500wi "Batman year one")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3812052970b-popup)   
Compared to Mazzucchelli in _Asterios Polyp_:

[![Asterios polyp](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3812356970b-500wi "Asterios polyp")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3812356970b-popup)   
Those aren't as different as I thought they'd be.  ("I have a hole in my cape," you can almost imagine Mazzucchelli's distraught Wayne saying.)  But outside the cleanliness of the lines, there's little to make you believe that the person responsible for the first image would later be responsible for the second ... and that's a belief I'm going to try to disabuse my students of.

**_Batman Begins_ (film) - Christopher Nolan**

Because you think I'm capable of teaching this course without bringing up Nolan's film?  [I didn't think so](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/batman-begins-works-because-christopher-nolan-decided-to-spend-the-first-hour-and-twenty-minutes-denying-the-audience-what-it.html).

**_Planetary/Batman_ (comic)  - Warren Ellis**

This'll be the fourth re-telling of the Batman origin  myth, only this time [endlessly looped](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/teaching-rhetoric-via-warren-ellis-planetary-batman-night-on-earth.html).  The point, rhetorically speaking, in having them encounter four versions of the same story is 1) to emphasize that there's some inherent appeal there, but 2) to demonstrate that even if a story has inherent appeal, the manner in which a given rhetor presents it actually matters.  The raw stuff is all well and good, but the power's in the telling.

**_Planetary_ #1 -10 (comic) -  Warren Ellis**

They're billed as "the archeologists of the impossible," after all,  and Ellis's engagement with both the history of the genre and its conventions could hardly find a more suitable course to be taught in.

**_All-Star Superman_ (comic) - Grant Morrison**

I'm thinking of teaching only [
the first page of the first issue
](http://acephalous.typepad.com/files/all-star-superman-01.jpg), as it's the most brilliantly compact origin story  ever, and after that Morrison's metafictional games might be a bit too much for students to handle.  There's a genius to its concision, _i.e._ the manner in which it boils down a story everyone already knows to its barest bones, and then presents them to a knowing audience in a way that is, quite frankly, moving.  (Sorry, sorry, I couldn't help myself.)

**_The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_,  Volume One (comic) - Alan Moore**

Introducing students to old-school, public-domain heroism ... plus  plenty of opportunities to talk with my largely Asian-American classes about how "The Yellow Peril" is  depicted.

**_Hellboy: Seed of Destruction_ (comic) - Mike Mignola**

Being an origin story that involved someone other than Batman, so the students can reevaluate their premises about mythos in American culture at the end of the quarter, etc. etc.

**_Hellboy_ (film) - Guillermo Del Toro**

Etc. etc.  That's quite a bit of material for a composition class, and textually speaking—_i.e._ despite it being all film and comics—it's historically and allusively dense to boot.  But it seems doable.   That said, if there's anything very obvious I'm missing, feel free to point it out ... until Tuesday, because believe it or not, that's when the Spring quarter starts.

My course-director/co-author asked me why I didn't just devote the whole quarter to Batman, to which I could only reply, "Then I'd be 'the Batman guy,'" and I'm not ready to go there yet.

You make me wish I was still taking classes or have the ability to just drop into one that sounds interesting.

I was just looking at this in more depth...does it make a difference that Mignola didn't write Seed of Destruction (though he did create the character)? When I went back and read Seed and compared the writing to the ones Mignola wrote, I was startled by how clumsy the earlier book was, not to mention the whole Hellboy character.
