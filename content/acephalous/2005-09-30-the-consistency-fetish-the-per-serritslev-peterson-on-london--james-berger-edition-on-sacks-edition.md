Per Serritslev Peterson’s “Jack London’s Medusa of Truth” (_Philosophy and Literature_
26.1) challenges our ideas about the notoriously eclectic and
idiosyncratic philosophical thought of Jack London, a.k.a. “The Boy
Socialist,” a.k.a. “The Adolescent Nietzschean,” a.k.a. “The College
Spencerian,” a.k.a. “The Middle-Aged Nietzschean Socialist,” a.k.a.
“The Forty Year-Old Jungian.” Despite bouncing from one
hermetically-sealed-but-internally-coherent philosophical system to
another for the majority of his short life, Peterson insists that
London’s critics misconstrue the nature of his philosophical questing. 
So he gathers London’s little truthlets and declares

London as philosopher 1) was a Nietzschean dialectician who
mastered and negotiated the juxtaposition of conflicting ideas,
perspectives, and values in life (the Medusa-Maya dichotomy being a
crucial case in point); and who consequently, 2) possessed
philosophical authenticity and integrity, or what Nietzsche terms
“intellectual conscience."

I generally applaud counter-intuitive readings.  When Peterson
identifies his as being such a beast, stating that his “contentions
must appear highly questionable in contemporary American academe,” he
implicates his article in the storied tradition which, as just noted, I
generally applaud.  However, the second clause of that sentence baffles
me: “seeing that very few London scholars or critics take the
novelist’s philosophy seriously.” Most London scholars not only take
one of his philosophical positions seriously, they construct elaborate
channels through which they can safely navigate three or four of them. 
Peterson’s argument is counter-intuitive in an artificial and synthetic
fashion...and in this sense resembles those London himself favored.  In
short, then, Peterson’s consistency fetish neatly doubles London’s own;
furthermore, it blinds him to the inconsistencies of his work much as
London’s blinded him to the inconsistencies in his.  That said,
Peterson’s performance easily outshines London’s clunky stabs at
synthesis; it is, to be frank, a bravura performance on Peterson’s
part.  _But I still don’t buy a word of it._

Then there’s the case of James Berger, a man I treated unfairly in [a brief post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/scholarly\_swing.html)
about what I (mistakenly) believed to be an (unintentionally)
infelicitous pair of sentences.  In “Falling Towers and Postmodern Wild
Children: Oliver Sacks, Don DeLillo and Turns Against Language” (_PMLA_
120.2), Berger discusses the work of Oliver Sacks as a singular body of
thought, consistent throughout, be he writing for a popular audience in
_The New York Review of Books_ or the scientific community in _Neurology_. 
(Now, I admit that Sacks is not the best example, since as I’ve skimmed
some of his scientific writing he seems more consistent than someone
like Steven Pinker.  But bear with me, since I’m not here to bury
Berger, but praise him.) For Berger, Sacks’ theory of a pre-linguistic
subjectivity--accessible through interaction with highly acculturated
aesthetic objects like symphonies and modernist poetry--exists in equal
measure in his popular and scientific thought.  

I would argue that a savvy rhetorician like Sacks would recognize the
ideological investments of his audience and pitch his presentations to
them: hence his references to patients cured by Beethoven, pains
ameliorated by Mahler and people reborn through Brahms.  I doubt those
staples of NPR appear as frequently in his scientific papers like, say,
“Cycad Neurotoxins, Consumption of Flying Foxes, and ALS-PDC Disease in
Guam.” Those references say as much about the audience a popular
science writer like Sacks keys his performance to please as it does
about his own thought on the matter.  (Or not.  This is why Sacks is a
bad example of this general phenomenon.) Here’s the thing: Berger’s
argument would be strenghtened were he to turn from what _Sacks_ believes to what Sacks’ _audience_
believes.  He need not worry about Sacks, or whether Sacks’ scientific
work jives with his popular, because the rhetoric of his popular
work--in which he appeals to an idea of a pre-linguistic subjectivity
accessible through highly acculturated aesthetic objects--proves
Berger’s point more powerfully by dint of its popularity.  He need not
focus on Sacks’ personal beliefs to deliver his argument convincingly.
