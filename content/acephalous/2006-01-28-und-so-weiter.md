**Unfortunate:** Deciding to post [this](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/mo/) yesterday.

**Unusual:**Â  Desiring and purchasing of a package of "Sticky Donuts" from Albertson's this morning.

**Unreal:** Seeing a van like [this one](http://www.ridejudge.com/rideDetails.asp?RideID=23289) _only hot pink_ parked in Albertson's lot.

**Surreal:** Realizing the old man with his face pressed against the passenger-side window peering into the van was [Etienne Balibar](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=external-search%!F(MISSING)search-type=ss%!i(MISSING)ndex=books%!k(MISSING)eyword=etienne%!b(MISSING)alibar)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1).

I can post again.

Obviously.

Not that I have anything all that interesting to say . . . 

. . . except that I wish I had asked Etienne what he found so interesting about that pink monstrosity.  I'm sure he would've cracked something obscenely quotable, since he seems incapable of saying much else.

:D No, this was a good follow-up to the "lame" post.

Have to read that thing you wrote in the Valve. Not today, though.

Well, John _did_ suggest that we should post something to cleanse the post-Moretti palate.  But yeah, you did hit a nerve there.  Several nerves.  Make that the nervous system.

SD, no need to read that novel over there.  It's 135 comments overbrimming with misunderstanding.  As Miriam notes, it's a sad spectacle, full of singed nerves, systems, and what-not.  That said, when Sean's article's actually available, I anticipate mass executions.  Protests.  Clowns on bicycles and LSD dropped . . . you know, the usual.
