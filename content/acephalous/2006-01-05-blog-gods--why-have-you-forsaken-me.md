## Blog Gods!  Why Have You Forsaken Me?

The three-thousand words I had written about Walter Benn Michaels' accusation that Holbo and I are as intellectually vacuous as Lindsay Waters have disappeared into the digital ether.  

I will rewrite that post tomorrow.  

Tonight I will mourn what was unwritten.

Please, please do.  I want to imagine the job drop.  The "But they are on the same side!  How could one of them be criticizing another?  WBM was Waters' target, and if WBM is \*not\* a signifier for HolboMcCannAnalyticPhilosophy, then there may be \*more than one side\*!"  Then the gibbering.  Then the realization that there may be nearly as many sides as there are thinkers.  Then more gibbering.

I do not know what you used to write, but whatever it is, it is terrible for software should never eat 300 words, much less 3000. None the less I will qoute DeLong for the benefit of those of you who use \*shudder\*  Word or something running on a Windows platform to compose your posts;

Dad?

Yes?

Can you help me with the computer?

What's wrong?... Oh, spinning beachball of death I see.... What are you trying to do?

Print.

Print a document from Microsoft Word?

Uh-huh.

Did you save it before you tried to print?

I'm not sure.

What's the first rule of using Microsoft Word?

That it does not like me. That it is not my friend?

And so before doing anything major to your document, you?

Save.

Before you print?

Save.

Before you print preview?

Save.

Before you globally change margins?

Save.

Before you reformat all the paragraphs?

Save.

Before you save?

Save--there's something wrong there, Dad.

OK. I'm going to have to kill Word. Let's hope you saved your document...

McCann is analytic?  I just thought he was a lit crit guy who read Derrida poorly on the apocalyptic.

Anyway, have fun "gettin' em".  Those silly Higher Eclectic assholes will really have to pick their job off the floor when you show the many different sides of analytic philosophy that they had no idea existed!  Because their dumber than Rich!  Who is smarter than them!  Yay!!!!!

Christ is this shit boring.  Shouldn't we be liberating a McDonald's or something?   Or at least making a spreadsheet of the abuses of McDonald's?  Or getting a haircut (I could sure use one!)?

What everyone fails to realize is how intellectually vacuous _everyone_ is in WBM's eyes.  We are all turds before the Lord, so to speak.  (And I _like_ WBM.  It's just tough to be on the receiving end of his wit.)

Richie, 

You're talking to me, right? In part? You keep saying this, that the WBM/Holbo exchange is going to make my/our head(s) explode. But it's really not surprising to me, that WBM and Holbo don't line up shoulder to shoulder on the battlefield of ideas. Not jaw (or job) dropping, sorry. 

Go ahead and port my comments over here if you need to, and I'll explain them yet again, but, I promise you, it's not going to come out the way that you're anticipating. WBM and Holbo have some features in common, especially through the lens of the Waters piece, but no, they're not coming from the same direction. 

BTW, while I am continually upset about the mistreatment of theorists and "theory" over on the Valve, I am one of the least side-taking literary academics you are likely to run-across. Seriously. I have a theoretical mindset, but my approach is entirely (too) New Critical, formalist, close. (I recently was accused, in a reader's report, of being in fact a sort of latter-day New Critic.) I am interested in marxist theory (tres passe), and think through things from a quasi-marxist angle. But trust me, your charge isn't going to stick, that I see the world in black and white.

Scott, yes, that's the sense that one gets from reading WBM's new one, I'm sorry to say. There's a way that one can become a bit too overpowering in one's argument - until the reader (this reader) begins to feel bulldozed, feel like he's not coming to things on his own anymore. 

Sort of, of course, Fishian.

All right, CR, I'm glad that you don't see them as lining up on the battlefield, although you certainly had a strange way of expressing it.  If you want to consider the whole thing closed, fine with me.

Good.  And I will add that I hope to someday see your real work, not in a "so I can make fun of it" sense but because I think that your approach actually sounds interesting.

You'll forgive me, I hope, for considering this non-post intellectually vacuous.

But I too mourn the loss of your 3000 words.  Is it OK, then, if I pick up the King Kong discussion instead?

I'm a little confused--did you mention that there is a Lindsey Water's piece in the Chronicle or a Chronicle piece about Lindsey Waters or quoting LW? If so, is there a way to read this without subscribing?

Jodi,

It's the [same Waters' article](http://chronicle.com/free/v52/i17/17b00601.htm) everyone was discussing before.  It became something of a touchstone in, well, almost every MLA panel I attended.  I'll have a reconstituted version of Walter's complaint about Waters, Holbo and myself up sometime tonight.

Anthony,

One of these days I'm going to have learn how to do a screen capture and then capture that scene from _Say Anything_ in which Cusack yells "YOU MUST CHILL!  YOU!  MUST!  CHILL!"  Because sometimes people really, really need to chill.  Not the best mindset from which to liberate The Golden Arches from...wait a second, who _did_ you want to liberate McDonald's from anyway?

CR and Rich,

Nice to see that worked itself out.  I always knew the sandbox was big enough for the all of us.

Isn't it just ctrl+print screen?

I think that this weekend should be the "carnival" in which all discussions are suspended, then the entire Internet can reboot Monday morning.

Anthony, if it is, I'm a moron.  Since I'm _not_ a moron, it can't be Ctrl+Prnt Scrn.  Not that I'm going to test this out.  My fragile ego can't stand that heat.  Would run screaming like a ninny from the kitchen.

Adam, I'm not sure that'll go over well: "I'm sorry people, but we're shutting down the Internet for the weekend.  Don't worry, though, it'll be back on Monday.  We _promise_."
