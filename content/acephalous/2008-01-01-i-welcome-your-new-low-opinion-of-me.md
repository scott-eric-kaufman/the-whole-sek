## I Welcome Your New Low Opinion of Me

Desperate for distraction, I spent some time this afternoon Googling my childhood.  The care with which it has been preserved is startling.  I found the whole thing.  I was surprised at how accurate some of my memories are.  

The cartoon about teen secret-agent race-car drivers with [the catchy theme song by John Lennon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2szxhTNdKKY&feature=related)?  

Accurate.  

The terrible show about [kid singers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids\_Incorporated) starring my first ever crush?  

Accurate.  

I wonder what ever happened to her.  Click on the link and—_Jesus_, _no_, _that can't be right_.  There has been a mistake on the Internet.  Someone has made a mistake on the Internet.  My first crush was [cute and blonde](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v515/bloodylamer/bastardly-photos/0505/album7/stacy\_ferguson01210601.jpg), nothing like that _thing_ responsible for the decline of Western Civilization.  How could they have the same humps?    

Can't be right.  

Just can't.  

I mean, [how would that even happen](http://socialitelife.buzznet.com/images/fergie2-1.jpg)?

Man, Pole Position--that used to come on around 06 or 0630 Sunday mornings, so my dad would tape it (probably on Beta) for us so we could watch at a reasonable hour. :D

Both _Pole Position_ and _Kids Incorporated_ were late Saturday morning fare, and since I played soccer and games started at 4 a.m., the only Saturday morning cartoons I could watch were the lame late ones.  (Except for _The Littles_, which deserved a "prime-time" 8 a.m. screening.)  (And I watched _Gummi Bears_, but only because they were re-run during the week.)

_I mean, how would that even happen?_

Plus meth.  Everyone looks better after meth.  I also feel that [high-waisted de-bibbed overalls](http://gofugyourself.typepad.com/go\_fug\_yourself/2007/06/celebrity\_terro\_1.html) have something to do with it.  They just _have_ to.

On the other hand, a five year age difference (I fall just about mid-way between you and Jonathan Dressner, give and take a month) means that our childhoods do not connect in their nostalgia nodules.  Except that I also watched _Gummi Bears_.  

I mean, come on, bouncy colorful drugtastic bears?  Who can say no to that?

What you fail to remember is the fact that you have a sister 10 years younger then you and so you continued to watch some kid's shows longer then your friendsdid. This was in the days of only one TV in the house.  So, she seldom watched Sesame Street and you were big enough to watch shows she didn't want to.  Not that you were spoiled or anything!

We had the same childhood and the same impulses! Only being a female I looked up my childhood crush from Sat mornings not too long ago to see where he was. Oblivion it seems. Oh well.  Listening to Pole Position brought back the memories. Yes, and the Littles too.

Oh, jeez, you've blown my mind--Fergie? On Kids Incorporated? No, no, no...

Having commented here so seldom, I wonder whether I'm revealing too much of myself too soon when I note that I remember—without having to look it up—that Mario Lopez was the (a?) drummer in that same "band."

Also, _Gummi Bears_ rocks and so does Acephalous. Glad to read that Rachel's doing well.

Should've kept reading. I'm very sorry.
