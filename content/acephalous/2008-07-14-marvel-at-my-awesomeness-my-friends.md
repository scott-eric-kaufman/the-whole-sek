## Marvel at my awesomeness, my friends

When I was left off the "The Top 100 Liberal Arts Professor Blogs," I didn't mind.  I'm not a professor, so crying because someone didn't include _Acephalous_ on a list of "Professor Blogs" would be beside the point.  So when I stopped crying, I wondered whether the category "Professor Blogs" included _all_ professors, or just _full_ professors.  Could an assistant or associate be included?  What about lecturers and adjuncts?   

As it turns out, my wrangling was for naught.  The list was [designed to attract traffic to a disreputable site shilling for online universities](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/im\_sure\_the\_valve\_was\_101st\_on\_the\_list/#21410).  But the commentary it generated has merit inasmuch as it included people praising me.  Not-half-bad-herself [Sharon](http://www.earlymodernweb.org.uk/) [wrote](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/im\_sure\_the\_valve\_was\_101st\_on\_the\_list/#21406): 
A list that excludes _Acephalous_ is basically worthless.

To which far-better-novelist [Adam](http://www.adamroberts.com/) [replied](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/im\_sure\_the\_valve\_was\_101st\_on\_the\_list/#21411):
Hear hear!  All hail the Glorious Leader!

Sharon later [lit into the list](http://www.earlymodernweb.org.uk/emn/index.php/archives/2008/07/time-for-a-good-demolition-job/) more exhaustively, prompting Ralph Luker to compose a list of [the 82 best history blogs](http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/52237.html).  As you might expect, given the breathtaking gloriousness that is this blog, _Acephalous_ came in first place.  You are reading _the best history blog on the internet_, but if reading losers is your bag, feel free to slum at some of the blogs not written by your Glorious Leader:

Yeah -- first place given that you had the forethought to make the first letter of the blog's name "A" and the second "c".

Wait a minute--you're a _history_ blogger?  And here I thought you were a lit-crit type.  No wonder I never understand what you're talking about...I'm making category mistakes all over the place!  And The Little Professor is too?  This interdisciplinarity thing must be contagious.

(Clearly making lists is the easy part; it's drawing lines that's challenging.)

Rich, it's not polite to explain other people's jokes.  What happened to civility!?!

_Clearly making lists is the easy part; it's drawing lines that's challenging._

Rohan, I tried to do that with my own blogroll once, but caved in the end and went with "Smart People" as a description.  Would that universities could have a "Department of Smart People"!

Rohan, people have been calling me a history blogger for eons. (Er, in internet time.)  I'm just going with the flow at this point.

Strikes me that there's a mistake there, since my blog's spirit name is aaaaäinthemedievalmiddle....

Geez, not only am I not an also-ran, I'm not even in the race. Maybe I should start writing more about Afghanistan, Guantanamo, Iran or Heath Ledger. On second though, f\*\*k it...Just going to keep enjoying the summer and let it all sort itself out in the fall. I actually think that's McCain's strategy, too...

Gotta say, though, you deserve top billing somewhere. Might as well be for your historical "sensibilities".

I felt the same way when I was left off the first list and included on the second.  I plan to move up by getting 79 people to make excellent history blogs with names that start with GP.

Now you've done it. Somebody's going to come along and make a blog starting with 2 a's to start it (or even 'ab') and it's back down the list for you, bub.
