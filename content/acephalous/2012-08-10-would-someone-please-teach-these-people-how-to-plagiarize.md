## Would someone please teach these people how to plagiarize?

Every quarter I tell my students a joke. I tell them that I’ll let  them plagiarize so long as they paraphrase their source material and  attribute the original idea to its author or put it between quotation  marks and identify where they found it. They usually stare at me agog  for a seconds before what I’ve said sinks in. But it usually sinks in.  It’s a shame I didn’t teach Fareed Zakaria, who’s not only a plagiarist,  but [one of the most stunningly untalented plagiarists I’ve ever encountered](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-sleeper/fareed-zakaria-plagiarism\_b\_1765903.html).  Another thing I tell my students is that if they’re going to plagiarize  well, they need to find source materials specific to the argument they  want to parrot, which means that they can’t just type “visual rhetoric  Blowup” into Google because the first few links will direct them [to stuff](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/blowing-up-slowly.html) [I’ve written](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/the-disturbing-wrongness-of-antonionis-blowup.html).  Only an idiot would quote my only words back to me. I encourage them to  find obscure material—like academic essays on Antonioni or Italian New  Wave—and pluck their attributed paraphrases or quotations from there. So  what’s so stunning about Zakaria’s plagiarism?

He plagiarized from one of Jill Lepore’s articles in _The New Yorker. **The New Yorker**_.  I know most people only read it for the cartoons, but I promise you  that Google has access to the words as well as the pictures. But  Zakaria’s even dumber than that. He plagiarized from a recent _New Yorker_ article _in the pages of **Time** magazine_. It’d be one thing to plagiarize a recent _New Yorker_ article  in an essay that only one person, your professor, will ever read. It’s  dumber thing entirely to publish material lifted from one national  publication in _another national publication_. He should have known that anyone interested in [the material he quoted](https://www.google.com/search?q=%!T(MISSING)o+check+it+is+the+duty+of+every+self-respecting%!C(MISSING)+law-abiding+man.%!)(MISSING) would pop onto Google and see that it appears in two different places  in a very nearly identical context. But wait! It gets even better!

It seems as if Lepore herself might have [a problem with plagiarism](https://twitter.com/evgenymorozov/status/234023201972310016), which if true means it’s possible that Zakaria second-order plagiarized _the work of an undergraduate at Harvard_. And we let this man talk to president and kings? To coin a phrase: Why oh why can’t we have a better press corps?

Thanks, SEK. The first thing I thought when I saw this story was that he was stealing from a pretty high profile source. This also seems like a perfect illustration of how a lower middlebrow publication steals from an upper middlebrow publication. 

I wonder how this will affect his work on CNN?

_I wonder how this will affect his work on CNN?_ 

I'm not sure he survives this. He's been put in time-out for a month, and I have a feeling he's going to be like one of those children whose drug-addled parents lock in the closet in May and only remember doing so in August.

It doesn't make sense. They must both have taken it from some other source.

Stunningly stupid. I'm crushed that one of my favorite journalists did this, and said as much over at my place: [http://piedtype.com/2012/08/12/dirtiest-word-in-journalism-plagiarist/](http://piedtype.com/2012/08/12/dirtiest-word-in-journalism-plagiarist/)  

Time and CNN may eventually forgive him; I won't.
