I attempt [to get back on the horse](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/10/titles-of-posts-about-breasts-that.html):
First, the infinite monkey theorem isn't a scientific aphorism, it's a probabilistic theory with a [mathematical proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite\_monkey\_theorem#Direct\_proof); second, for someone as knowledgeable as [Ben] Shapiro in what he would call _The Art of Writing Prose Such That The Mellifluousness Of Which It Is In Possession Cannot Be Contested_, that is one 
ugly
 sentence. If he wants to write about typing monkeys, he needs to read his Borges . . .
