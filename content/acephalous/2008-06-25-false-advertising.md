## False advertising

I’ve been thinking quite a bit about book covers lately — less because I’ll produce anything worthy of one than how _dreadful_ the covers of most academic books are.  You’d think the book-designing _avant-garde_ would
be thrilled to work with people unconcerned with sales or money, yet
the best cover I’ve seen in ages still falls prey to [put-a-giant-fingerprint on-a-book-about-fingerprints](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674010027/diesekoschmar-20) logic.

That said, it could be worse:

Had I access to my old laptop and its surplus of image manipulation software, you’d be treated to covers of novels entitled _POISONED!_ featuring drowned bodies.  

Or [something like this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/treasure.jpg).  (Only better.)
