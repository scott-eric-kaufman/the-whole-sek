I think it's clever today.  I'll no doubt hate it tomorrow.  What do you think?

Also, I've been screwing around with it all day to no avail, but maybe you can help.  Know how make the center column larger than 500 pixels in typepad?  I'm loath to convert it to an advanced template, because I don't have the time to screw around with it, but I'd like to squeeze a few more than three words per line, if possible, while retaining the centered banner (which I can't have if I do the fluid layout.

Oh tell me about it. I'm so fickle when it comes to the look of my site. Love it one day, hate it the next. I like it, though. Did you notice that your name is cut off on the lower right-hand side? 

As for changing the center column, you need to modify your css file ([http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/styles.css).](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/styles.css).)

Near the end of the file you will see ".layout-three-column #beta." Underneath you will see "width: 500px;." Simply change the number to your desired width. You may have to alter the width of your sidebars as well though. So if it looks funky let me know and I'll look through your code again and find what you need to alter.

Nope, doesn't work for me.  Don't like the gray-on-gray color scheme; the banner is too wide for my monitor, which remains set at 800 x 600; the headless statue really should be there; having the stamp with the A next to the Cephalous is going to have half of new readers thinking the blog name is Cephalous -- which sounds a whole lot more pretentious than Acephalous.

Rich doesn't like it, so I do. Actually, that's not the appropriate causality, but it sounds fun. And I think it looks good.

Rich, I was about to say "But I made sure it wasn't wider than 800 pixels!  I made the banner 770 and the sidebars are 30 each!"  Then I thought about it.  Yes, it's too wide for the screen.  Damn it!  I can change the grey-on-grey color scheme, however.  (Already done!)  

Hmm...so I suppose my banner conceit was too-clever by half then.  It was supposed to the be a faux-snapshot of a the upper-left hadn corner of a letter, with the "A" stamp, the "Cephalous" and then my name cut off.  Oh well, back to the drawing board.  (Can you tell how productive a weekend I've had writing?)  

Kevin, what's odd is that I've only been antsy to change since I hit my one-year anniversary; but since then, I've been looking for some way to keep the color scheme but ditch the format.  Unforunately, that's easier said than done.  Thanks for the advice on the width, but now I need more: is there any way I can make the site fluid but have my banner always centered about the center column?  Because I can't seem to figure out how to do that.  I've ever fired up Dreamweaver and looked at the code...but, well, I'm not as good at doing that as I used to be.  (And my wife the web-designer has some all-consuming paleography project due on Monday.)

Thanks, Rodney.  I do need to fix the banner width, but I may stick with the letter conceit for a day or two and see what happens.  I'm really more concerned about the central column, however, since it makes it look like I write a hell of a lot more than I feel like I do.  (Then again, I have one of those 1920 x 1200 laptop monitors, so it looks like the blog's floating in a sea of black.)

P.S.  I, too, miss the headless man.  Maybe I can put him on the stamp and spell "Acephalous" out in the "return address"?

Can you guess what I'm going to say? For the sidebars, the orange or whatever on black is ok, but dark text on light background for the posts and comments would be much easier on the eyes.

I miss the creepy headless statue.  And there's a disharmony between the banner and the rest.  The middle column especially seems to be floating away, unanchored to the rest.

But I like the bookshelves.  And I like the idea of a 'decorated capital' whether on a stamp or not.

I want the headless statue back.  Or you could replace it with one of those gross medical photos of Acephalic births.

I'd also like a picture of Dog the Bounty Hunter.

I'll work more on the format tomorrow.  I only now realized I had the "stamp" on the wrong side of the "envelope," which should tell you about the headspace I'm in.  

For Jonathan's benefit, I've increased the intensity of the colors.  I'm not happy with any of the light-colored-columns and dark lettering combinations.  I'll keep trying.

My efforts at transforming my headless avatar into a stamp have failed; for that I need the photoshop wizardry of the Little Womedievalist.  (I have, however, re-placed him to his former position.)

I'm thinking, though, that I hate the constrictedness of this format.  I blog to be effusive...and it's difficult to imagine myself being so with such tight margins.  So I may ditch the "envelope" thing and try to create some banner which can work right-justified and blend with the ends.

Sort of like [this one](http://www.urop.uci.edu/).  How _did_ she do that?  I haven't a clue.  I'd ask her, but she's still in well-nigh panic mode about matters paleographical, so it'll have to wait.

It's as I suspected: 

Stuff ain't funny when it's cramped.  I'm certainly going to have to rethink this format tomorrow.  It's ugh-a-rrific tonight.

Getting rid of the big yellow letters is a must.  Also, what's up with the centre-formatting in these comments?

Holy Moses!  I've turned into Alphonse Van Worden/Le Colonel Chambert!  I can't seem to stop commenting on my own posts.  Please, someone, help me.  Write me a chapter...or two.  Three if you're feelin' generous.

Alright.  Big Yellow Letters have been retired.  As for the center-formatting, well, if I want to have a centered banner, I have to have everything in the center column squeezed into 500 pixels.  (Haven't tried to screw around with Kevin's recommendations yet, but will tomorrow.)  I think I'm going to have to create a masthead that fades to black on the right in order to have fluid columns again.  I can't take this four-words-per-line thing.  It's as if they _want_ us to be short, sweet and stupid.
