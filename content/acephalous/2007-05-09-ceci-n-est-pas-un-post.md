You can tell, because the comments aren't open.  (Deposit comments on this un-post [here](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/cue\_blogwide\_st.html#comments).)  This is merely a reminder that, as [the strike](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/cue\_blogwide\_st.html) draws to a close, the 500th comment is still up for grabs.   Remember, you can have me write about _anything_ you so desire, so long as you're the 500th commenter.  I'll post my criterion for inclusion in the final count when I announce the winner.  

In the meantime, Timothy [suggests](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/cue\_blogwide\_st.html#comment-69011516) you post a link to the strike on some conservative blog.  Because that would look like link-spamming, I won't endorse it ... however, if you want to write a little diatribe about how much you hate Jesus/Bush/Republicans/pants, post it in the comments then link to that.
