So I’m not cracked to be thinking [this Yglesias post](http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/06/the\_pure\_line.php) was a poem, considering [how it rendered in Google Reader](http://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/mypoet.jpg).
The first two lines are easy enough to improve — drop the “that” and
“and energy to,” or maybe “time and … to” — but the third and fourth
are a mess, but one with potential. I’d love to find a way to squeeze
the bureaucratize of “official gatherings of descendants of Thomas
Jefferson” into a single line, but alas, I’m doomed to failure.

So not a _well-crafted_ poem, but a poem nonetheless.  

Only not.  

(And yes, I need new glasses.)
