Because he claims to have studied literature:





Or maybe not. Maybe he’s [this](http://faithandheritage.com/?author=28)
 “Southern gentleman and blogger,” also named Scott Terry and also from 
North Carolina, who is “working toward a degree in Philosophy and 
English, likes long walks on  short beaches, fishing and breaking 
liberal talking-points into tiny  pieces (then spreading nasty rumors 
about those pieces!).” [Because they seem to have quite a bit in common](http://faithandheritage.com/2011/06/a-young-mans-reading-list/). Both, for example, are very concerned about “standing up for our [_sic_]
 heritage as Christian white men.” Even if that’s a different Scott 
Terry, I will say this about the self-professed “Southern gentleman”: 
it’s about damn dime someone created “a conceptual ladder” that prevents
 Christians from “betraying [their] God and Father” on “[a]ll of [their]
 positions, from abortion to alien abduction.”
