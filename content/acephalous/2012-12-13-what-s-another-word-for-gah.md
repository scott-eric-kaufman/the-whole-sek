I just read your [Lexicographical Lament](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/all\_scribes\_uti.html). It kind of reminded me of reading Hombi Bhabha, but there's one problem -- it's too easy to follow. If there aren't 4-7 subjects with a different number of predicates and multiple impacted clauses _per sentence_, it ain't academese.

Agreed, lots of big words, not enough sentences that require complex parsing to understand the point they're trying to make.
