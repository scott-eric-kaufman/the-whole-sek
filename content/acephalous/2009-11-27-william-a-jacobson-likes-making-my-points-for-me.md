			Which is unfortunate, because I'm about to call him illiterate. He [claims](http://legalinsurrection.blogspot.com/2009/11/race-card-player-has-lot-to-learn.html)
that I argued that Sarah Palin and her supporters are "racist because
there were so few non-whites pictured in the available photos." I did
nothing of the sort. My claim, as you can tell by [the words I used to write it](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/11/you-only-noticed-im-white-because-youre.html),
was that the "images she and her people have decided should represent
her mass-appeal on a mock-presidential bid launch" demonstrates that
"her own handlers consider her appeal limited to white people." I even _emphasized_
that first statement in the post, which as we all know is the online
equivalent of burying it under a rock behind the fire-pit in someone
else's backyard. ("Officer, you can search my property, absolutely, but
I assure you that you won't find any claims here.") You would think
that a law professor would be able to recognize an argument when he saw
one, but apparently not, which is why he provides evidence that
bolsters mine. He quotes a reporter from MSNBC:  
"I
can tell you this crowd today was very, very diverse, a lot of people
from different races, ages, all coming to see Palin and wanting get a
glimpse of who this lady is that says that she's going rogue."If this is true—and for the moment, I grant that it is—then Palin and her handlers _are deliberately not posting pictures of the many non-white people who attend her events_.
That, Mr. Jacobson, is the sort of evidence that someone like me would
use in support of my claim that the pictures posted to her page are
designed to appeal to a specific audience. Because I don't trust you
with logic, I will draw the obvious inference for you: Palin's people
are excluding photographs of the non-white people who attend her
appearances because those photographs aren't intended to appeal to a
non-white audience.  

_Which was my original point_.  

You do realize that you're helping me out here, Mr. Jacobson, don't you?  

He
also claims that I "maliciously and falsely referred to one
conservative blogger as a 'noted racist.'" But—no doubt for some reason
other than it demonstrates that Riehl's a racist—he doesn't reproduce [the link](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/11/dan-riehl-still-a-racist-only-now-a-homophobic-one.html)
that I included to a post demonstrating that Riehl is, in fact, a
racist. He also makes the classic debating mistake of assuming facts
not in evidence when he claims that I only did so "because this is the
internet, and no one is held accountable," his assumption being that
were I to meet Riehl on the street, I wouldn't call him a racist. Of
course, being that these words are also on the internet, I can't prove
to his satisfaction that I wouldn't; however, in a different context,
he would point out the fact that because I'm an academic who hangs out
with [folks like this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/update\_africana.html), I spend all day calling _everybody_ I pass on the street a racist, and since Riehl belongs to that category—how about a little freshman logic, Mr. Jacobson?  
SEK calls all people who are on the street a racist.  
Dan Riehl is a person on the street.  
Therefore, SEK calls Dan Riehl a racist.I
would say that syllogism puts him in a bind, but I think we can safely
assume that someone who believed my earlier posts were intended "to
smear the crowds at Palin book signings" probably never took freshman
logic, and thus isn't even aware that he's in one.

Racism used to be so ugly. Now it's like something you find everywhere and it's of an increasingly unalarming nature. This is a good thing I guess.

Well, no doubt it's "unalarming" to people who were never alarmed by it in the first place. The only difference now is that those people feel emboldened to _show_ that they aren't alarmed by it, and actually, that really is a good thing. Obama's election has functioned as a kind of truth serum on some people to an extent, and it's good for black people in particular to see that. It makes things like the "I'm colorblind" dodge that much more transparent.

But no I'm not alarmed by Mr. Riehl saying that people should all hang together. I'm a lot certain he wasn't trying to organize a lynch mob.

Just cause Obama's black doesn't mean he's not a crappy president, you know.

That's correct: he just wanted see the black President and a largely black organization hanging together.

_I'm a lot certain he wasn't trying to organize a lynch mob._

As am I.  However, there's certainly something off about a person whose brain spits out hanging language when he tries to criticize black people.

_Just cause Obama's black doesn't mean he's not a crappy president, you know._

Absolutely.  On this, Howard Dean and I agree.

_It makes things like the "I'm colorblind" dodge that much more transparent._

And yet brokered more often now than before the election, mostly by people who, like Darleen, insist that the real racists are all non-white.  Even more bizarrely, they want to claim that because their ideological opponents voted for a black man, they and their ideological compatriots can't possibly be racist.  There's some strange slippage going on there.

The "hang together" locution is pretty well-established and isn't really about hanging anybody at all, actually. I just... I think we need a different word for that than racism.

Nobody got oppressed by what Mr. Riehl said I don't think.

It's tough to optimize the balance between two opposites, in this case, appealing to racists while appearing to be non-racist.  It's a balance every wingnut national politician has to find.

Local wingnut candidates are under no such pressures.

Sarah Palin is a greasy backwoods strumpet.
