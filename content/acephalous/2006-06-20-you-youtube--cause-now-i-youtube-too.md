## You YouTube?  'Cause Now I YouTube Too.

For the first time in my life "next September" won't involve sitting in or standing before a classroom.  I've taken all the deep breaths I can short of hyperventilating and am _still_ a little unsettled by the thought.  'Cause quarter-century habits die hard.  Expect little intellectual from these parts until I catch my breath.  

Here's some entertainment instead.  I browsed YouTube for the first time tonight and learned stuff:

1.  Tom Waits [doesn't want to grow up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzKiqk2iynY), but in about 5 minutes he'll be [so full of bourbon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpYftnVxRQ0) he can't stand up and someone'll convince him [to endorse meat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYOMPU18QjA).
2.  The Replacements [are young bastards](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0p0NjsciOY).  Children by the million scream for [Alex Chilton](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aCOpLa9m4c) but slum along with [Paul on The Skyway](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxls3Zs\_BHY).
3.  Leonard Cohen [renews his neurotic affiliation with Canada](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW18n-nStzU), proves he's as [beautiful man as he is a loser](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqu3U05tkAw) and [told you when he came in 1967 he was a stranger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLq7Aqd\_H7g).
4.  Neko [implores you to hold on](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIW69l-iT0o).  [Maybe the sparrow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVjcsRO6N7s) can explain why she reminds me of [Johnette](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioXHtONNKSU).
5.  Will _someone_ please give Mr. Tweedy [a shot in the arm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrZ0-AzOxqw)? 6.  Wanna play in the Bronx?  You'll have to [cut your hair](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCsEBEO-guw) before they'll [bring on the major leagues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D6xXYe5QOY). 7.  I will get tenure.  I have my very own [official ironman rally song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqmcINr4JKA).  If that fails, well, I'm not afraid to use [my valuable hunting knife](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A8LyAqtaa0).  'Course then I'll have to start a new life.  But I say you take these things [head on](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SheTnX1cHqQ) or not at all.

You know, the Canadian was right... The Arcade Fire can't help but rock it something fierce when performing live. There are also some great John Renbourn covers that will allow me to figure out the man's fingering on so many of the songs I've been wanting to see for years...even if they're played by some fifty-year-old guy in glasses, sitting on his bed of uninspired reproduction. (I have to wonder...does YouTube have any covers/instructional videos for Leo Kottke tunes?) Yup...There goes my summer.
