From _The English Journal_ 39, no. 4 (April, 1950):
**_Literary Anthology_**_  

by Albert W. Dowling_

Variety is here arrayed  
From Edgar Guest to Count de Sade;

From Socrates to Herbert Read,  
From Samuel Pepys to André Gide;

Both Sigmund Freud and Mary Lamb:  
All tastes—from caviar to Spam.

Each sample edited and shorn;  
Each passage bloodless, lifeless, torn.

Too scant of essence, too much froth;  
Too many cooks, too little broth.

_A Poem Having Nothing Whatsoever to do with **Anna Nicole Smith**; also, Who Pronounces It Like That?_

You still lose points for posting that name. I hope you can forgive yourself! :P

Wasn't it in _A Wrinkle In Time that a character describes himself as the "happiest sadist," and insists that if pronounced right, the two words should rhyme?_

One of my teachers pronounced it that way, and for a while I wanted my rap name to be "Marky-de-Shade" but I was run aground when I figured out why nobody understood that it was a pun.  I'm pretty comfortable with my current rap name ("Scientific American").
