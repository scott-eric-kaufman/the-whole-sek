Teaching composition exclusively leads to (1) a greater appreciation
for the pedestrian complexity of correctly subordinated clauses and (2)
a bone-tiredness for the unmerited praise of student peer reviews.  As
someone with a penchant for paragraph-length sentences, I find (1)
wholly salutary; but (2) irks me endlessly.  Why?  In one of my
undergraduate History of the English Language course, the professor
handed out slips of paper on which he had written a single sentence and
told everyone to decipher what it meant, because he wanted us to
present the sentence and the paraphrase to the class in ten minutes. 
My sentence read:

Another thing there is that fixeth a grievous scandal
upon that nation in matter of philargyrie, or love of money, and it is
this: There hath been in London, and repairing to it, for these many
years together, a knot of Scotish bankers, collybists, or
coine-coursers, of traffickers in merchandise to and againe, and of men
of other professions, who by hook and crook, _fas et nefas_,
slight and might, (all being as fish their net could catch), having
feathered their nests to some purpose, look so idolatrously upon their
Dagon of wealth, and so closely, (like the earth’s dull center), hug
all unto themselves, that for no respect of vertue, honour, kindred,
patriotism, or whatever else, (be it never so recommendable), will they
depart from so much as one single peny, whose emission doth not,
without any hazard of loss, in a very short time superlucrate beyond
all conscience an additionall increase to the heap of that stock which
they so much adore; which churlish and tenacious humor hath made many
that were not acquainted with any else of that country, to imagine all
their compatriots infected with the same leprosie of a wretched
peevishness, whereof those _quomodocunquizing_ clusterfists and
rapacious varlets have given of late such cannibal-like proofs, by
their inhumanity and obdurate carriage towards some, (whose
shoe-strings they are not worthy to unty), that were it not that a more
able pen than mine will assuredly not faile to jerk them on all sides,
in case, by their better demeanour for the future, they endeavour not
to wipe off the blot wherewith their native country, by their sordid
avarice and miserable baseness, hath been so foully stained, I would at
this very instant blaze them out in their names and surnames,
notwithstanding the vizard of Presbyterian zeal wherewith they maske
themselves, that like so many wolves, foxes, or Athenian Timons, they
might in all times coming be debarred the benefit of any honest
conversation.

That would be from the [_EKΣKYBAΛAYPON_](http://books.google.com/books?dq=Thomas+Urquhart&client=firefox-a&pg=PA177&id=eU0JAAAAQAAJ#PPA177,M1)
of Thomas Urquhart, best known for his translations of Rabelais.\* In
Urquhart, Rabelais found less a translator than a kindred spirit; but
in Urquhart’s prose, I found an unparaphraseable wall of words, before
which I stood befuddled but impressed.  Granted, I _should_
have been impressed, so the analogy to peer reviews is imperfect; but
my comprehension and subsequent paraphrase of Urquhart amounted to what
I abhor in peer reviews: salivation at the sight of a dependent clause
containing multiple polysyllabes and a “Good!” slapped in the
margins—as if knowing big words and including them complex sentences
means someone’s saying anything meaningful.  But now that I teach
composition exclusively, I see similar instances of unmerited praise [_everywhere_](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/29/RVF916KM93.DTL&feed=rss.books):

When most former major leaguers write memoirs, you
wonder why they bothered; with Ron Darling—Yale graduate, former New
York Met and Oakland A, and current Mets broadcaster—you wonder why it
took him so long. What other former athlete could write a sentence like
this even with assistance from a professional writer (Daniel Paisner):
“This right here [[his legendary college pitching duel against St. Johns star Frank Viola](http://books.google.com/books?id=5\_9o-afj1nwC&dq=angell+%!g(MISSING)ame+time%!&(MISSING)printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=xsjKgts5xb&sig=i93Xsi5qRw6MFlkr1HaE80iFBxM&hl=en&ei=3tLPSZexF5fItAO4-9ygAw&sa=X&oi=book\_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA213,M1)\*\*]
was one of the great epiphanies for me as a competitive athlete, only
it took a while for it to resonate.” Most former pitchers can’t
resonate even with help.

Just so you know, my love of _béisbol_ [knows no limits](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/a-modernist-lineup-.html); moreover, my love of the Mets generally, and [Ron Darling](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/don\_delillo\_scr.html?cid=14896293#comment-14896293) in particular—both as a player _and_ announcer—is unimpeachable.  But for the _San Fransisco Chronicle_
to praise a Yale graduate who double-majored in French and Southeast
Asian history and who speaks both Chinese and French fluently—to praise
him (if it _was_ him and _not_ his co-writer) for using
the words “epiphany” and “resonate” makes me want to quodlibetificate
into demission this clusterheaded intelligentry, the miserable baseness
of whose expectations ought to debar them from the profession of
letters.

A fun [letter to the editor](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/opinion/l29reading.html?\_r=1&ref=opinion) of the NY _Times_ today, in the course of criticizing multiple-choice reading comprehension tests for elementary school students, relates this amusing story: "To make this point 40 years ago, my colleague in teacher education at Queens College would distribute the London sports page to our prospective teachers and assess their comprehension of the articles about cricket. They all failed, although they were bright, successful college seniors." -- not exactly parallel to your professor's exercise maybe.

_Verily._

Indeed!  (Now we sound like Instapundit.  Thanks a lot.)

_Are you a New York native, then?_

The northern part of New Jersey that considers itself part of New York until I was 10, Louisiana until I was 21.  Needless to say, my accent would've been hilarious if it hadn't been Brokaw'd by years of speech therapy.

_not exactly parallel to your professor's exercise maybe._

You know, I had a sentence in there explaining what the point of the exercise was, but took out after realizing I'm not even sure that was the point.  My student-thunk conjecture was that he wanted to boost our confidence, because we were reading works in which 25 percent of the words were archaic but understood the gist of anyway.  Then I realized that that would've been a pointless enterprise, so now I have no idea why he had us do that.  Other students got bits of Chaucer or _Beowulf_, and really, the odds of an undergraduate getting the gist of Anglo-Saxon without some preparation are slim to absolutely, positively none.

There is a theory that if an instructor gives students an assignment early in the semester that is too hard for them to do well, it actually has a positive effect on student learning: I think it's supposed to shock them out of their complacency, of something like that.....

Sorry, but I read it and it says:

"There are a bunch of cheap Scots in London.  They are so annoyingly cheap that we should shun them."

What am I missing?

You're missing that it's a single sentence, which was the most important thing.  To wit:  

"Man, I hate me some cheap-ass Scottish bankers, cause they suck."

Hans, what JPool said, with a helping of "Even though SEK had studied Latin for two years and read Rabelais, Foster Wallace and _Mason & Dixon_ when he encountered that sentence, he still couldn't parse it in the short time provided."  I could now, maybe, er, I mean, _of course_, but then?  Not a chance.

_There is a theory that if an instructor gives students an assignment early in the semester that is too hard for them to do well, it actually has a positive effect on student learning: I think it's supposed to shock them out of their complacency, of something like that..._

Is there?  I know the theory of culling the herd by assigning massive amounts of reading early on, but I suppose there'd be a benefit to giving them what seems like an impossible task early, then repeating the exercise later to demonstrate all they've learned . . . in fact, that sounds like a fantastic idea.  Codifies the course, demonstrates the usefulness of what may've seemed like busy-work.  I like it!  Now, to see how it to implement it . . .

_Is there?_

Yeah, but I can't find the reference quickly. Ironically, doing the exact opposite -- giving an easy test at the beginning of the semester -- is a good way to raise your student ratings.

The before-and-after thing is cute, too: good luck with it!
