## Impulse Control Issues; or, the Sum Total of Fun Had Today

It seems turning a forty-five page chapter into an eight page talk is easier than I thought it would be.  Remove the questionable material—the argument you're still not altogether satisfied with, the claims you think a little too bold, &c.—and you're left with about twenty pages of solid material to choose from.  

Of that twenty pages, about five of them contain material that won't work without the expunged bits ... which leaves you with about fifteen pages to re-sculpt into something talk worthy.  

Tomorrow begins the process of [repeatedly reading the thing aloud](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/01/painstakingly\_c.html) in order to slough some dross and smooth the rougher bits.  

However, what I really want to talk about is [The Nightmarish Frog Thing](http://www.progressiveruin.com/2007\_09\_23\_archive.html#2874922224739409073).  

Hold on—that's not right.  

What I _really_ want to talk about is [disbanding all theology departments everywhere](http://itself.wordpress.com/2007/10/02/theology-in-the-university/#comment-1694).  

Wait—that's not right either.  

What I _**really**_ want to talk about is this brilliant [mash-up](http://www.beaucoupkevin.com/2007/10/josh-started-it-and-then-it-was-all.html) of the old Batman series and Frank Miller's ridiculous [_All Star Batman and Robin_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All\_Star\_Batman\_and\_Robin); in particular, I want to talk about this one:

My apologies.  That's _still_ not right.  

What I 
_**really**_
 want to talk about is [this picture](http://allordinary2.blogspot.com/2007/10/lucky-we-kept-all-those-records.html) Laura took, and the five minutes of Photoshop fun it provided me.  So, without further ado, I present Leonard Cohen's _Songs of Love and Hate_, via LOL:

That's the sum total of fun I had today.  All five minutes of it.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to start reading something aloud until I can no longer stand the sound of it.

The quotes in the mashups are all from _Dark Night Returns_, not (as far as I know) from the work you mentioned.  Right?  Am I missing something?

The link that took me there identified as _ASBR_ -- which, admittedly, I haven't read -- but it's interesting how stilted even good Miller can sound out of context.
