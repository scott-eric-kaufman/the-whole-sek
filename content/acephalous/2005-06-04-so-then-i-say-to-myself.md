"So self, you think recapitulating an incredibly funny but ultimately puerile prank from 1885 is the best thing to do shortly after acquiring a large public venue for your scholarly ruminations?  You think _now_ is the really the best time to write about heaving bosoms and all that other Cleland-esque nonsense?"

To which I replied, "Yo."  

Was I trying to get under my skin?  "If you have something to say to me, say it already," I said.

To which I replied, "Yo."

My faux-taciturn resolve was starting to piss me off.  I couldn't believe what I was saying.  Was I actually dismissing myself with a stern, masculine and monosyllabic "yo"?  Had the years of proximity to the John Wayne Memorial Airport finally rubbed off?  I had to find out.  "Say 'yo' again and see what happens," I braved.

"Yo."

"This is your last chance," I said as I tried not to over-think my next play.  If I moved quickly enough I could blind-side me, but then I asked myself, "Would John Wayne sucker-punch himself?"  Then I remembered that I've never seen a John Wayne movie, and that the closest thing I've ever seen to a western is HBO's _Deadwood_.  You can guess what came next.  

"Say it again, cocksucker."  Then I went beserk.  Not me, the other me, the strong silent one, the one who doesn't overthink things.  I was all over myself.  I kept on swinging until I nearly passed out.  I could hear myself mocking me with that calm, collected "yo," followed by a vicious hook, "yo," another hook, "yo," another, "yo."  Next thing I know, I've knocked myself silly.  When I finally come to, I look at myself and I realize I wasn't myself at all.  I had mistaken me for a [Japanese robot](http://japantoday.com/e/?content=news&cat=2&id=339372) designed by Idaku Ishii which can, theoretically, hit a baseball traveling 187 m.ph.  

"Damn," I thought I said to myself, but apparently said aloud.

"Yo."  

Blackness.  

I hope I recover soon.
