			...but in the [series of photographs](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/gallery/2009/12/best-boss-ever-michael-steele-the-rnc-interns.php?img=1) of Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele and his interns that [shani-o linked to](http://www.postbourgie.com/2009/12/11/posted-without-comment-12/) this afternoon, we have:  

1.  Steele and a white guy
2.  Steele and a white guy
3.  Steele and a white guy
4.  Steele and a white woman
5.  Steele and a white woman
6.  Steele and an Asian-American guy
7.  Steele and a white guy
8.  Steele and a white woman
9.  Steele and a white woman
10.  Steele and six white guys, five white women, and one black guy
11.  Steele and a white guy
12.  Steele and a white guy
13.  Steele and a white guy
14.  Steele and a white woman
15.  Steele and a white guy
16.  Steele and a white woman
17.  Steele and a white guy
Of
the 28 interns Steele posed with, a full **93 percent** of them are
specularly (and most are spectacularly) white. This isn't to say that
the Republican National Committee has a racist internship program;
after all, the "diversity" of his interns is also a reflection of the
diversity of [the applicant pool](http://www.gop.com/index.php/housekeeping/Internships/).
Given the lengths to which the GOP goes to appear more inclusive than
it actually is, I'm inclined to think those may have been the only
non-white people who applied.

Maybe it's sexual preference diversity they're going for.

They're not just pictures, each is a thousand words screaming at me.

A little bit of a cheap shot, no?  I mean, we all know the demographics here.  African-Americans overwhelmingly vote Democratic, how many do you think are going to be Republican party activists?  I don't think that's a sign of a preference for tokenism, rather, in a world where diversity is seen as a good thing, they have no choice but to practice tokenism.  Obviously, the need for all of this is caused by a number of actual policy preferences, a bad track record on civil rights issues, etc...  But making fun of the lack of black people who apply to be interns at the RNC isn't exactly engaging on those issues.
