Welcome to the show.  Weeks of anticipation have led to this.  Hearts will be broken.  Dreams crushed.  This will be one for the ages, folks.  It looks like we're underway.  

Fair catch called for.  We'll be right back.  

They want to pass.  Man in the slot.  The defense will have to tighten up.  They bring pressure from the corners.  He has all day back there.  What poise.  He scrambles.  Has a man open.  Launches a frozen rope.  That'll move the chains.  Here's the snap.  He feels pressure on his left.  He telegraphed that one.  There's a flag.  Some extracurricular activity after the whistle.  Choice words were exchanged.  The zebras try to sort it out.  We'll be right back.

That'll cost them.  First and a mile.  Hike.  They need to look deep.  A man is open.  He has a step.  Right in the numbers.  That is pocket presence.  Here's the snap.  Mishandled the exchange.  No fun on the bottom of the pile.  He's up with it.  Differential is so important now.  Their ratio is good.  They strip with the arms.  We'll be right back.

They want to establish the ground game.  He's had a great year.  Here's the snap.  He tries to turn the corner.  He hits the hole.  Great blocking at the point of attack.  He was overdue.  Now they want to pound it on the ground.  They won't have much success if they play one-dimensional.  Pump fake.  Looks like he's short.  Three and out.  He sends out the kicking team.

Fair catch is called for.  We'll be right back.

It is all about controlling the tempo.  They want smash-mouth.  Look how he grinds it out.  Great second effort.  He runs downhill.  They need to dominate the line.  There is some confusion in the secondary.  Safety calls time.  We'll be right back.

Here's the snap.  Cuts back against the grain.  Punches through.  You could have driven a truck though it.  I like the way he hits the hole.  This thing will be won or lost in the trenches.  There's 1,000 lbs. of beef down there.  They want to pound it on the ground.  Big things happen when you keep your legs moving.  The front four have to tighten up.  They need to make a stand here.  They show blitz.  Audible.  They're going to air it out.  Looks to his left.  Great coverage.  He hears footsteps.  Tries to run.  Has daylight.  Wow!  They put the lumber on him.  Really rang his bell.  He's slow getting up.  I hate to speculate but . . . we'll be right back.

What I don't understand is ... when they, you know, _pick up the ball_, which, like, _they keep doing_, why doesn't the ref blow his whistle for handball?
