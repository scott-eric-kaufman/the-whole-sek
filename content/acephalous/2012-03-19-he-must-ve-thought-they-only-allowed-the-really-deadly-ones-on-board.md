_SEK is standing in the security line at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Behind him are three young men with shave heads and many muscles._

**MARINE #1:**Yo! Marines?

**MARINE #2:**ARE AWESOME!

**MARINE #3:**Every member of the other armed forces is a giant weeping vagina compared to–

**ALL THREE:**MARINES!

_SEK ascertains that these strapping young men must be Marines. He proceeds through the checkpoint with no problem, so too do the first two MARINES._

**TSA AGENT:**(_to the third MARINE_) Sir, can I ask you to step aside?

**MARINE #3:**(_looking perplexed_) Me?

**TSA AGENT:**Yes sir.

_The TSA AGENT pulls a Paul Hogan “[Now THIS is a knife](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_vW54lAtldI)” from the third MARINE’s carry-on._

**MARINE #3:**You can’t take that! It’s my _graduation_blade!

_SEK would tell you what happened next, but loitering around security checkpoints while sporting a beard is a bad idea even if you’re a Jew._

Put that in a movie and it would be a sign of the script writer's failure of imagination.

Real people have the habit of being hilariously clichéd. But! I sometimes think that makes for better dialogue. I mean, take Omar out of _The Wire_ and the dialogue's not nearly as interesting, but it still resonates from the years Simon spent researching _Homicide_.
