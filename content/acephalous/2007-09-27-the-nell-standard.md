(_Swiped in its entirety, and without shame, from [here](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the\_nell\_standard/)_.)

Upon reading Miriam's [response](http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the\_little\_professor/2007/09/death-gloom-etc.html) to yesterday's [post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/09/read-happy-book.html), it occurs to me that Collins [proposes](http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0914/p09s02-coop.html) a novel standard of literary value.

1.  Convene the PTA on the docks.
2.  Call up to the clipper's captain: "Does Little Nell yet live?"
3.  If "yes," deem the book acceptable.Â  If "no," start the bonfire.

Swiped without shame?  You know, Scott, Iain Banks writes literary work as Iain Banks, and SF as Iain M. Banks.  I always thought that would be hard to beat in some way, but maybe not.  I'm not sure why i thought of that, just now.

Rich, the _Valve_ piece was by 'Smurov'; this is by 'Smu R. Ov'.  Completely different personae.
