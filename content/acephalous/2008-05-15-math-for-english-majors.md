## Math for English Majors

In the University of California system, your Spring Quarter fees cover you through the summer.  The fees cover health insurance.  The second I file my dissertation I'm no longer a graduate student and lose my health insurance.  So I can:

1.  File in June, be done with the dissertation, but have no health insurance.
2.  Finish the dissertation by June, file in September, and spend the summer insured.

I'm working with the math here, but it consists entirely of numbers.  Suggestions?

#2 seems like the obvious choice. Several  considerations, however:

1) will you be charged tuition for the semester in which you file?  

2) if you \*actually\* finish in June, you should spent the Summer doing other things  

3) if #2, when will the degree be conferred? this might affect getting a job stuff  

4) do you do a defense? what's your committee's schedule (including outside readers if you have to defend before them, too)

I agree that #2 seems like the better choice.  What's the down side?

If there is a down side, would you qualify for COBRA?  It would be expensive, but less so than self-insurance.

Also, what about the Little Womedievalist?  Could you be covered under her insurance?

Hey, I was just going to ask you all about your graduation plans ... are you walking in the ceremony? When's the big party? And can you really photoshop a mortarboard onto the headless Lenin statue?

Just FYI, as many of our undergrads know, "walking in graduation" and "finishing the degree" are two very separate entities... and one of my friends walked last spring with a completely finished dissertation; when she didn't make finalist for any of her VAP positions and was offered some TAships in the writing program, she sat on the revisions and just didn't file that year. Nobody official said anything about it or anything. She was all done with everything and had a final printed-out version and everything, she just didn't walk it over to the library yet. 

So I would vote for #2, unless the plan of hanging on the Little Womedievalist's coattails works out. 

On the other hand, the longer you wait, the longer the malevolent forces of the universe could send you another situation with THE LIBRARY or other bureaucratic snafu.

Karl:

_will you be charged tuition for the semester in which you file?_

I will ... but since they don't charge grad students for Summer work, I've already paid it.

_if you \*actually\* finish in June, you should spent the Summer doing other things_

Yes, like revising my slop into something publishable ... which, given recent events, is much more pressing than I thought.  I mean, really, as I told Sisyphus, my dissertation's "there" in a "done dissertation" sense, but it's not "_there_" yet.

_if #2, when will the degree be conferred? this might affect getting a job stuff_

The position I've lined up only requires I be done before the Fall quarter begins, which I will be if I file in the Summer. 

_do you do a defense?_

NO!  But I wish I did, since there's nothing ever in the entirety of my existence I'm more prepared to defend.  Seriously, at this point, I _want_ to defend it, because I'll probably never be more qualified to defend anything else in my entire life.

Morfydd:

_What's the downside?_

Actually, that's why I posted this so open-endedly.  I can't see any, and just wanted to make sure I wasn't overlooking something obvious.

_If there is a down side, would you qualify for COBRA? It would be expensive, but less so than self-insurance._

COBRA's an option, yes, but it's an expensive one.  Basically, I'd be working to pay for coverage, whereas in an ideal world I'd do more than break even.  

_Also, what about the Little Womedievalist? Could you be covered under her insurance?_

Sadly, I wouldn't qualify.  The UAW's made strides since I've been here, but spousal coverage still ain't included in the package.  (I spent a few years on the other side of this, trying to get her insured, but to no avail.  Given the budget cuts the past few years, and well, there's no shot of pushing it through.)

Sisyphus:

_Hey, I was just going to ask you all about your graduation plans ... are you walking in the ceremony? When's the big party? And can you really photoshop a mortarboard onto the headless Lenin statue?_

I wasn't planning on walking until my mother informed me of THE GREAT FINANCIAL WINDFALL\* it'd entail.  So now I think I'll walk.  As for what I'll wear ... I'm going out as I came in, _i.e._ headless and stupid, so yes, I'll Lenin up the place.

_So I would vote for #2, unless the plan of hanging on the Little Womedievalist's coattails works out._

I'm actually going for both, I think.  Keeping the insurance, heading on the market this year, but having SECRET FAITH that the wife with her SUPERIOR SKILLS and EXPERT KNOWLEDGE will provide me coattails enough to ride on.

\*Jews.  They value education.  Who knew?

I defended at the end of last summer, and that worked out for me.  I probably could have gotten done by the end of spring quarter if I had to, but with no job as of April, I decided hiding out in school for the summer was not such a bad option.  There were no consequences for me to finishing in September rather than June, since the position I did end up with started in October.  Insurance-wise, I got GradMed for the month or so inbetween.

Another issue that is perhaps important: Does the university consider you to be the resident of your apartment, or is The Little Womedievalist included?  In other words, if you're no longer a student, will you both get booted out?

You don't even have to defend your dissertation?  Why oh why have you been writing / revising it all this time?

You neglected the most compelling advantage of #1, though, that being that whatever malevolent force that haunts your life in an evident attempt to keep you from ever finishing your diss will have less time to work.  I can hardly wait to see what will happen to the "all done" dissertation.  Something like the global paper-eating microbe in Lem's _Memoirs Found in a Bathtub_ perhaps.

I only have one comment here .... MATH**S**!  MATH**SSS**!! Math**s** with **AN 'S' ON THE END!!!** as God and Nature intended.

Now you may think that a ridiculous British foible.  But over here in Britain we also have, amongst other things, a National Health Service, which means that gobsmacking, oppressive and genuinely evil questions like this don't plague our lives.  So some British foibles have their merits.

"Math" without the "s" is easier to pronounce.

To make sure that the file containing your dissertation is not destroyed in the interim, you should put it on Bit Torrent (perhaps an encrypted version) and request that all your readers seed it.

I can't believe you don't have to do a defense.

Fortunately, the apartment's in the wife's name, so we won't be booted when I finish.  

_You don't even have to defend your dissertation? Why oh why have you been writing / revising it all this time?_

Because I keep getting notes from my advisor that I need to change this, that over there, and this thing, what's it doing in here?  

_I only have one comment here .... MATHS!_ 

I meant to write maths, but hadn't had anything but oatmeals to eat that day and was a little light-headed.

_To make sure that the file containing your dissertation is not destroyed in the interim, you should put it on Bit Torrent (perhaps an encrypted version) and request that all your readers seed it._

You know, after I lost the revised version of my first chapter, I did something very much like this.  I keep current copies of it on a secret server with no connection to my computers, so even if they're all infected with something or other, I'll still be able to retrieve my dissertation.  

Yes, I'm _that_ paranoid.

_I can't believe you don't have to do a defense._

I'd _love_ to defend.  It's just a quirk of the system here that I don't.

Unless you're an incompetent, or one of your committee members has an ax to grind, a thesis defense should be a cakewalk: at that point, you are the world expert on your topic and the only way they should be able to trip you up is by asking you about things -- theories, implications, topics -- that aren't actually part of the dissertation. I have heard horror stories of both incompetence and grinding axes, though.

In my case I got out without one because the requirement was added on after I came into the department, so I was grandfathered out of it. Plus I was already working full-time, fifteen hundred miles from campus.

Ahistoricality: well, yeah, I knew all that going into mine, which is probably precisely why I felt I looked like an idiot. I sort of wish I HAD prepared more than, you know, spending 4 years writing a diss.

_I have heard horror stories of both incompetence and grinding axes, though._

My oral qualifying examination would be a case in point.  I did horribly.  One day I'll tell that story.  (If I haven't already.  I don't think I have.)  But the dissertation defense would be different, I think, because I know my material.  I think the only thing likely to trip me up would be the broad questions about other criticism of the novels and stories I'm working on.  I've a terrible memory for names, and in most cases, it's been so long since I did the "deep background" that I've dust-binned everyone who didn't make it into the dissertation itself.

Or, with all the revisions, not remembering what is and isn't in the current versions -- but I could speak intelligently about all parties involved, so that wouldn't be an issue.  

_I am willing to attack your dissertation so that you can defend it._

I might take you up on that offer.  Sort of like a public stoning, only in slow-motion, and captured forever ...

Me, too. It's the one time in my graduate career that I'm absolutely sure my advisor went to the wall for me. (though I was, without a doubt, one of the most marginal students ever to finish; I suspect I set a new standard for "adequate" which stands to this day.) But the dissertation was another matter entirely: not as interesting or as thoughtful as yours, by a long shot, but I was going places none of my advisors ever had and I knew my stuff.

Four? Just four? No wonder you had trouble with the defense. I didn't feel ready until I'd been working on it for at least six, and didn't actually finish until I had nine years of dissertating under my belt.

Money be damned: you'd better walk or I will think less of you.  Don't pull this "oh, I'm too cool and take my education too for granted to actually go through the ceremonial recognition of my completing my doctorate" nonsense.

On the insurance/summer question, don't be stupid.  Get your entire committee to sign off on the thing as soon as you're done in June, then just don't submit the paperwork to the grad school office (or wherever) until the end of August.  Take a couple weeks and go on vacation somewhere after the committee signs off, then sure, spend the summer sending one or two chapters out to journals somewhere.

_It's the one time in my graduate career that I'm absolutely sure my advisor went to the wall for me._

Same here.  In the end, I couldn't even remember the author of a book I'd written a tome on not two quarters previous, so I think they could tell my brain was shot.

_But the dissertation was another matter entirely: not as interesting or as thoughtful as yours, by a long shot, but I was going places none of my advisors ever had and I knew my stuff._

I don't think my dissertation's going to be that interesting; or, at the very least, the introduction's going to more interesting than the chapters, for reasons I'll explain at some future date.  (Some connections are sounder the bigger they are, so the close-readings in the chapters sort of work against me, I think.)

But yes, I certainly know my material better than, well, maybe two or three other people on the planet?  

_Will I have to read it, or can I just say that it sucks like analytic philosophy and neoclassical economics?_

I'd _prefer_ you read it, but I won't insist.  

_you'd better walk or I will think less of you. Don't pull this "oh, I'm too cool and take my education too for granted to actually go through the ceremonial recognition of my completing my doctorate" nonsense._

Scott's Mom hearts Dr. B.  The only sound argument is that it's not for me, it's for everybody else, and I appreciate that.  I _still_ don't want to have to sit around hearing someone read the phone-book -- the analogy verges on the literal here -- but I'll do it.

Don't forget the wonders of modern technology: bring a camera and take silly pictures of each other while waiting for your name to be called, text each other on your phone ... or live blog it for the website! Forget the stupid beach ball everyone confiscates; bring a Gameboy or whatever the latest minigamer thing is. 

Or, go old school and just bring a flask. Time is what you make of it, and if after all that education you can't even cause trouble and amuse yourself, then you have no Inner Resources. Heh.
