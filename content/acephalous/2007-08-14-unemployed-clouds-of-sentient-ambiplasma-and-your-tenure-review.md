## Unemployed Clouds of Sentient Ambiplasma and Your Tenure Review

Every other blog I read linked to John Tierney's "[Our Lives, Controlled from Some Guy's Couch](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/14/science/14tier.html?ei=5087%!A(MISSING)&em=&en=2599cf4760a9fc47&ex=1187236800&pagewanted=all)" today.  The article and the work it describes dutifully scream the strained lyric required of all academic appropriations of popular culture: __
_SCIENCE FICTION MAY BE SCIENCE FACT!_

Don't get me wrong.  In all probability, we _do_ exist only in the damp basement of some posthuman slob's parent's housicle, orbiting a dilapidated artificial planetoid in a once posh sector of subspace.\*  And in all probability, the housicle dangles from an asteroid which only exists on the backup server of a quantum computer floating in the depths of a gas giant orbiting a dying sun, under the care of a shiftless cloud of sentient ambiplasma.\*\*

This is a given.

Much more interesting are the comments of Jonathon Von Post, which appear on [all](http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/2007/08/do\_we\_live\_in\_a\_computer\_simul.php#comment-533807) [the](http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/13/even-if-life-is-but-a-computer-simulation/#comment-23079) [blogs](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/01/aaronson\_on\_the\_basics\_of\_quan.html#c007066) which link to the Tierney.  Von Post complains that the article's subject, [Nick Bostrom](http://www.nickbostrom.com/), fails to note that he, Von Post, beat him, Bostrom, to the we-are-simulated-by-positron-electron-entities a-googol-years-in-the-future punch.  I'm not able to evalute his claim, since the article in question, ""Human Destiny and the End of Time," published in _Quantum Science Fiction_ in 1991, isn't available online.  But Von Post's crusade for acknowledgment, however superficially narcissistic it may seem, is a compelling reminder of a couple of things:

1.  In academia, precedence matters.
2.  There's no official means of establishing it.

Given that this is the case, I'm led to these thoughts:

1.  If _Quantum Science Fiction_ was online and linkable, Von Post's claims could easily be verified.
2.  If _all_ scholarship was available online, our judgments wouldn't be influenced by who turned out to be the better popularizer. 

I admit that Von Post sounds like a crank and behaves like a troll.  Still, there's a chance his embitterment is justified, that he was steamrolled by a duplicitous colleague or ignored by an unethical careerist.  A freely available, easily searchable scholarly database could put such issues to rest.  If establishing precedence were but a Google Toolbar away, how much festering animus could be lanced clean?  

I don't know, but I'd love to.

\*When s/he thinks about us on hir thog, hir co-thogger rolls eleven eyes and wonders, not for the first time, whether he should do hir a favor and unplug us already: "S/he slithers around the basement in that hideous sweatpant for 3,971 hours a day and it's not healthy.  S/he'll be dead before s/he's twenty-two centuries if s/he keeps this up."  

\*\*Its psylog (pronounced "slog" by the mouthed) is currently devoted to Lindsay Lohan's recent legal troubles, from which it's two simulated realities removed.  This should come as no surprise.  It _really_ loved _Mean Girls_, and 
thinks
 knows "Linds," as it calls her, will still be the next Glenn Close.

I don't know if I have enough annoyance left after considering current events to be annoyed by this, but it's the kind of thing that usually annoys me.

1.  "Wow, we might all be simulated -- in fact, if anything \*can\* happen, it \*will\*, so we probably are!"  People who don't read SF don't know how tired this is.  It's like how every literary writer all of a sudden rediscovers the alternate history novel.

2.  Von Post is really claiming to be scooped on this idea, based on a publication in Quantum Science Fiction?  In 1991?  Oh, please.  If he was publishing as an academic, it has to be in something other than Quantum Science Fiction.  If he was publishing as SF or SF criticism, it has to be something earlier than 1991.

3.  If someone asked an actual SF critic, such as, say, Adam Roberts -- or read his history of SF -- they'd probably realize that there is no particular difference between the idea that it's likely that we're being run in a undetectable future simulation and the idea that the universe is in the mind of God.  This is just yet another SF reworking of a religious trope.

4.  Who knows whether they talk about the actual detectability of simulations, beyond the "if we try to simulate everything within a simulation, our computer will crash" nonsense.  (If you can simulate a universe, you can probably simulate someone in that universe running a simulation -- by altering the "clock speed", which is undetecteable by people within the simulation, if nothing else.)

5.  You'd think that when people revisit this chestnut they'd talk a bit more about the actual example of simulation failure that we live with all the time -- dreams.  One's brain simulates reality in dreams very badly.  For instance, I used to have dreams in which I would try to read some book or message -- but my dreaming brain evidently can't make up a message quickly enough, so I would be unable to read it, figure out that this was because I was dreaming, and be annoyed within the dream.

6.  This reminds me that I was going to write something about _Polystom_, which addresses many of these issues, and haven't yet.  That's annoying too.

Rich has covered the ground admirably (and Scott the precedence issues as well). 

I will merely note my despair that such lame excuses for new ideas get so much attention.

The amazing thing to me is that Bostrom's article actually got published in a journal...  standards for what counts as philosophical scholarship must be pretty low these days.  Given that, I don't understand why Jonathon Vos Post would want to claim precedent.  (Since the basic idea has obviously been around for decades and has no doubt been independently rediscovered by scores of high-school nerds pondering their computers, any claims of precedent by Bostrom would have to be specifically for the analysis, such as it is, that he brings to the subject.)

Rich:

_People who don't read SF don't know how tired this is._

Didn't Descartes cover this territory with his "Evil Genius"?

_If he was publishing as an academic, it has to be in something other than Quantum Science Fiction.  If he was publishing as SF or SF criticism, it has to be something earlier than 1991._

That was my first response: _QSF_ doesn't sound peer-reviewed.  Then I realized he posted an article _and_ a short story based upon it in the same issue.  Can't claim precedence when it ain't peer-reviewed.  

_This is just yet another SF reworking of a religious trope._

I think the article references Berkeley, but as per above, I think the man in question's Descartes.

_I used to have dreams in which I would try to read some book or message -- but my dreaming brain evidently can't make up a message quickly enough, so I would be unable to read it, figure out that this was because I was dreaming, and be annoyed within the dream._

I frequently have the can't-read-this dreams, but they never lead to I-must-be-dreaming revelations.  Instead, they imbue the following day with high-octane frustration: "I spent all night feeling stupid, and now I feel stupid too."

_Who knows whether they talk about the actual detectability of simulations, beyond the "if we try to simulate everything within a simulation, our computer will crash" nonsense._

Also, the fact that the computer simulating our reality never crashes.  As if Microsoft won't still be around in the year 92,391 B.O.M.

Ahistoricality:

_I will merely note my despair that such lame excuses for new ideas get so much attention._

Agreed.  Why, exactly, is this considered "cutting edge"?  Because it's sort of like _The Matrix_, which is only 10 years old!

Kurt:

_The amazing thing to me is that Bostrom's article actually got published in a journal... standards for what counts as philosophical scholarship must be pretty low these days._

That the (purported) precedent for this rehashed Cartesianism is a science fiction _magazine_ is telling.

Interesting.  I think that you could actually figure a good deal about a literate person by their reaction to this kind of dream-problem.  When I look at a book in a dream, I can't see it as English text -- I can't imagine a text fast enough, or "quote" a text from memory, but perhaps someone with really good imagination or memory could.  (Could an experienced writer write a new text fast enough while dreaming so that they could read it?)  I also can't imagine it to be in some strange alphabet that I can't read, because my visual imagination isn't good enough.  Finally, I never really seem to think that I might just be unable to read for some reason -- it's too much a part of my persona.  So the only thing left is that I must be dreaming.  It works a lot like what I'd imagine as a certain kind of simulation failure.

The end effect is that now my dreams avoid any kind of written material, which is odd -- you spend all day reading, and then it has to have no place in your dreams.  I'd guess that many people have self-censoring dreams that avoid parts of reality that they can't convincingly imagine.

I can't remember ever dreaming about reading, successfully or otherwise. That's odd, because I certainly spend enough time doing it. 

I've never dreamed about blogging, either. 

Tonight should be interesting....

I don't know what this means, but I often read in my dreams, and, at least in the context of the dream, the words all make sense.
