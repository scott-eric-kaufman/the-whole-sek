## On Evaluative Criticism, Part the First of an Interminable Series; or, Emetic Prose and the People Who Emit It

In the seminar room, graduate students set aside their typical standards of literary dress and don the scholarly robes they're expected to wear.  They leave whatever criteria compels them to purchase books for reasons of pure enjoyment outside the seminar room when they enter it.  Why?  Because evaluative criticism has no place in contemporary scholarship.  In [my second entry](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/welcome\_readers.html) on Pinter's Nobel selection, I complained that "if [the selection committee has] been influenced by his recent poetry then they've
compromised their standards and have degraded the legacies of previous
award winners."  My reasoning behind this statement is fairly simple and straightforward: his politically convenient poetry barely qualifies as poetry.  It's heartfelt, yes, but so is the work of the fifteen year old "[playwright](http://acephalous.typepad.com/)" who penned this dialogue:
So many changes happening at once.  I don't see how we survived it.  Turn on the television and what do you see?  Massacre and slander coming from the next generation.  The point, if you want the point of it.  Well, I don't have one.  That's the problem, I find the strangest little paradoxes of life, but no useful meaning of or for them.

Comma splice?  Check.  Wildly inappropriate conjunctive phrase?  Check.  Super-sincerely felt emotion expressed via a pompous faux-philosophical soliloquy?  Check.  It contains all the familiar elements of a life and its concerns vomited on the page.  The "poetry" Pinter's produced since he announced his retirement has that familiar emetic feel.  So one answer to  [Rich's complaint](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/welcome\_readers.html#comment-10340933)—that "contemporary literary studies is so far away from considering issues of
quality that [there are not] any grounds for complaint that the Nobel
choosing process is political"—would be that poetry which excites vomition should not be rewarded with a Nobel Prize.  Why does it does it have that effect?  Sheer dreadfulness.  

The rhyme scheme?  Terrible.  The rhythm?  Uninterestingly inconsistent.  The propagandistic intent?  Brazenly transparent.  Combine aesthetic inaudicity with patent proselytical intent and what you have resembles neither art nor skillful propaganda so much as an adolescent discharge of undigested emotion.  Does this constitute evaluative criticism?  It certainly does.  I find it interesting that the ear for language Pinter possessed in the '50s and '60s has turned tin since his retirement.  I had always considered that particular skill permanently acquired.  Pinter proved me wrong.  Whatever it is about his political commitments that has caused his ear such atrophy interests me intellectually, but it doesn't validate his latter-day ejecta aesthetically.  It gives them the gravitas due all talent squandered, but it doesn't compel me to read a whit more than I absolutely have to.  

All of which is only to say that I can't identity the antecedent of "it" in the previous sentences, and that the more I attempt to the more tangled my thought becomes.  I do not believe, as some suggest, that any account of my reaction would necessarily constitute an _ex post facto_ justification for whatever gut reaction I've had.  There's a reason my gut reacts as surely as there's one my knee sometimes jerks.  What "it" is will require more thought than I can currently spare.  So I implore you, dear readers, to spare me some thinking and tell me why you have such reactions, so that I might read your comment, delete it and claim its logic as my own. 

[_I meant to cover so much more ground tonight.  A discussion of why so many scholas in English departments begin their careers as medievalists but retire contemporary Americanists, for example.  Another discussion about the manner in which my students react to David Quammen's article "Strawberries Under Ice" will also have to wait.  All these matters intertwine, I assure you.  Only I have to leave the tangle to tomorrow_.]

Well, I know that I should never comment when half asleep.  Still, I'll give it a shot.

There's some missing step from your account above.  It starts with the declaration that "evaluative criticism has no place in contemporary scholarship."  Then it goes into "poetry which excites vomition should not be rewarded with a Nobel Prize."  But how do you know that it universally excites vomition?  (Well, I think it probably does, but stay with me.  This is a thought experiment.)  You've said why it excites vomition in Scott (rhyme, rhythm, intent, combination of all these).  But without scholarship, do you have any reason why you can say that it should do so for the Nobel committee?

I can see several reasons that appear generalizeable.  Let's start with intent, with leads into aesthetic considerations.  Umberto Eco, in \_The Open Work\_, wrote an essay concerning kitsch.  He defined it, if I remember correctly, as art that tries to force the viewer to feel a particular emotion.  Poems like Pinter's \_American Football\_ would seem to meet that criterion.  Perhaps kitschiness is sort of a universally perceivable quality.

Or the rhyme and rhythm concerns might lead to a more technical generalization.  Something on the order of: poetry in English has rules based on the structure and content of the language, and all/most people who know English will be similarly annoyed by inept rule-breakings.

But these don't seem to go far enough either.  Why should literate people dislike kitsch?  Why should people have similar "ears" for poetry?

It seems to me like such statements can only be justified if you posit some essential similarity between people.  Otherwise you're really left just saying, I dislike this.

Well, I've rambled about this before, but I can think of a few reasons why people might have similar artistic judgements.  They fall into the general categories of the biological, the sociological, and the cultural.  Now I really am getting too un-awake to finish this, but it seems to me that a lot of one's ability to become annoyed at overtly political artistic judgements depends on which of these you believe is responsible for judgements being more than purely personal.  The cultural end shades into politics, so that it you think that the only reason that everyone likes a certain type of poetry is because they share a certain type of high-culture education, for instance, it's hard to say why people shouldn't say that they like Pinter particularly because he breaks these rules.

I see the evaluative dimension of criticism as a matter of rhetorical appeal to an imagined reader of a work.  I.e., in writing an appreciative analysis, you try to convince the reader a) that the work is based upon some sort of worthwhile and interesting project and b) that it fulfills this project.  Conversely, a critical reading attacks both of these things, revealing a banal intention or an incompetent attempt to actualize it.  This appeal will be based on the assumption that your reader can be persuaded into having the same aesthetic reaction that you do (it doesn't assume that this same aesthetic reaction already exists, merely that it potentially could).  It will also be based upon scholarship - in the sense of careful attentiveness to the work and its context.  I think that this kind of appeal is implicit in virtually every literary interpretation.

Rich, what you're hinting at at the end of your comment is much like what Hume set down in "On the Standards of Taste."  Basically, Hume argues that practice makes perfect.  The more art you experience, the more times you experience the same piece of art, the more reliable your taste.  But as Rich asks, more reliable to whom?  

So let's turn to review writing, which is the one place where evaluative criticism endures.  Where we're talking Pitchfork.com or the LRB, the review is fairly basic: put the work in some context, make one's criteria clear, and discuss the extent to which the work fulfills its own potential as well as one's expectations.  The bottom line here is the record review: should I buy it or not?  Should I read it or not?  Should I go see it at the Googleplex or not?

So what do we mean when we say that a critic's taste is reliable?  Isn't it at some level that, beyond the evaluative criteria, the reader of the review catches a glimpse of the work under review?  Through selective framing, contextualizing, and quotation, evaluative criticism goes beyond "thumbs up" and "thumbs down" and, at its best, transmits an intense dose of the reviewed object to the reader.  This is why a good portion of the best reviews are descriptive: they latch onto a key aspect of the object and re-present it to us with that focus.  Which is to say, in the act of descriptive, great reviews are creative or generative.  

I'm using "review" and "evaluative criticism" here interchangeably, perhaps because the two have more in common than either does with academic scholarship.  But then there's another genre of nonfiction writing that often gets grouped in with the evaluative, but only because, I believe, it too is unlike academic work.  It's what we might call "the writer's criticism."  Think of W.G. Sebald's discussions of art and literature in his works.  Or Iain Sinclair's.  Or Bruce Chatwin's.  Or Coetzee's.  Or Anne Carson's.  

Here, we aren't simply getting evaluations or "thick descriptions."  What we get from writers' criticism is the thrill of watching one great mind in pursuit of another great mind, of one style wooing another style.  Creative writing programs catch a lot of shit these days for producing "workshop lit," but at least in my undergraduate creative writing experience, I found it liberating to be invited to write about poets and novelists in a non-thesis-driven, non-scholarly way.  This is the joy we find in reading Pater or, more recently, Ashbery on poets, O'Hara on painters.  This is the joy even in reading Nate Mackey's essays, which mix the scholarly with the ecstatic.  

The question remains, though: does evaluative or "creative" nonfiction have a place in the academy?  I think it depends on how we view English as a discipline.  If we want it to mirror the sciences, then scholars of English must produce new knowledge.  If we want it to mirror the arts, then scholars of English should display in their criticism the same delicacy and sensitivity and taste as the best artists unveil in their art.  Or, simply put: when we read literary criticism, are we reading for form or content?  For the thrill of a mind at work or for usable information and accurate interpretations?  

Or is this a false binary, one that points at the real problem?

Or is this another stupid rhetorical question, desperately trying to achieve a sense of ending so that I can gracefully exit from this blog comment?

Stephan: "your reader can be persuaded into having the same aesthetic reaction that you do (it doesn't assume that this same aesthetic reaction already exists, merely that it potentially could)".  What distinguishes this form of criticism from propaganda?  It doesn't really seem that different from convincing the reader that they really want to buy a particular toothpaste or support a particular political party.  For those reasons, I wouldn't see any reason under this theory to criticize the Nobel committee for giving the nod to Pinter except \*ineptness\*; if only they had wooed us with some amazing description of how great Pinter's poetry was, the "actual quality" of the poetry would be immaterial, for there is no such thing.

The first half of Luther's comment is concerned with description that permits the readers to decide whether they are likely to think the work a good buy.  This would appear to avoid the implicit problem of assuming that your readers have similar tastes: you describe the work intensely and the description will appear attractive to some but not others.  But I think that this doesn't address the part of the review that is actually evaluative -- doesn't a descriptive criticism also exist?  And I think that the description within a review, if closely examined, will be likely to have evaluative aesthetic theories or judgements embedded in it. 

The second part is also interesting, but I'm running out of time now.  Someone more familiar with the academic environment should comment.

What I think about this can be presented through a sort of inverse version of the story about the blind men and the elephant.  In this version, you have a number of scientists all suffering from elephantiasis of the hands, so that their hand-waving keeps them from seeing what's really going on.

First up is a biologist.  "We know that the capacity to aquire language is biological.  There are areas of the human brain devoted to it, and a lot of observations of the manner in which babies learn it quickly.  Language clearly provides a benefit to people who can use it with others; there would be no mystery about why such a part of the brain would evolve.  Next, I think that we can consider literary quality to be, essentially, skillful use of language.  Therefore, it appears probable that the reason that people who like literature like similar kinds of things is that the language centers of their brains are similar.  That would mean that literature truly is universal; if you brought someone to sufficient familiarity with a language and the cultural meanings of words used in that langauge, they should be able to distinguish between good and bad literature in that language."

The linguist is next, and decides to use the virtue of brevity.  "Um, deep structure."

The sociologist is next.  "No one finds it surprising that a society has a system of manners and of other group assumptions that permit the society to function.  So why shouldn't they have shared assumptions about literature?  It doesn't really matter what they are, as long as they help to bind the society together, provide various narratives of meaning, and incidentally provide status to certain artists and critics.  There is also an element of class differentiation between high-culture and low-culture literary values.  If this is true, we should expect that societies may differ from each other in their literary values, but that each society has one or more related, defineable ideas about which types and forms of literature are good.  Insofar as languages become identified with the most powerful societies using those languages, each language builds up its own literary values."

The historian chips in at this point.  "I basically agree with the sociologist, but that isn't complete.  If you look at the actual way in which our current literary values were formed, you'll see various stages of influence from the literature of past societies: from Greece, Rome, the Middle East, and so on.  And in recent history various societies have influenced each other's literary values strongly according to which seemed to have the prestige of being technologically or economically advanced over others.  Therefore there should be no surprise that there is now an essentially global system of literary values."

At this point the literary studies person says something about how there really are no literary values.  I won't attempt a parody of the sort above; everyone here should be able to mentally write a better one than I could make.

One could extend this to more sub-specialties, but I think that those are the basic lines.

Now, it should be possible, at least in theory, to design experiments to distinguish the results of the predictions of these theories from another.  I am completely unfamiliar with what kinds of things have actually been done.

But it seems to me that reflective people must implicitly believe one of the types of theories above to be able to say anything about literary quality that doesn't reduce to "I like this" or "I don't like this".  The alternative is to have a conservative's theory of literary value: criteria were handed down, and all right-thinking people agree with them, and that is that.

Rich,

There is of course an element of "salesmanship" in literary evaluation.  However, the appeal is an attempt to make the reader see a pattern in the work, or in the work's relation to its context, that he or she may not have seen before.  This is something that critics do all the time - especially when new styles of work arise that challenge readers' expectations and seem, at first glance, like nonsense.  I.e., imagine trying to teach Finnegans Wake to an undergraduate class.  There probably isn't going to be much of an underlying agreement in taste here.  You have to persuade the class first that the work isn't utter nonsense, that there's a pattern behind it and a reason why Joyce wrote it the way he did.

The same thing happens in the evaluation of popular art.  Within a given genre, a fan will understand the difference between good and bad work.  This understanding will be based upon his or her knowledge of the genre and of whether a writer has done interesting things given the genre's conventions.

The problem with your account of a universal appreciation for literary style, even your historian's one, is that it neglects the extent to which defining literary value is constantly a matter of contestation, especially in modern societies.  I.e., at this point in your conversation, your sociologist should point to Bourdieu's "The Rules of Art" and argue that the literary field constantly changes as artists (and critics) try to outdo each other, to promote new or previously ignored works and demote others.

Obviously one could try to make an argument about Pinter's poetry in this way.  I don't think it would be a very convincing argument, though.  It would probably, at some point, turn into an appeal to the reader's political sensibilities: i.e., "This poem tries to say something about the bellicose mentality that underlies both football and the Gulf War.  If you think the Gulf War is a bad idea, you should like this poem."

Stephan, I don't think that your description of the class being taught how to appreciate Joyce necessarily conflicts with any of the possible explanations.  As Luther wrote in his reference to Hume, there appears to be an element in appreciation of practise makes perfect.  Even the biologist would say that people without brain damage have the capacity to learn language, but that they need to practise in order to develop actual skill with language.  Perhaps there are some forms of literary art that you can't appreciate until you have built up to a certain degree of understanding of complexity.  As for the "attempt to make the reader see a pattern in the work", isn't this really a different form of criticism than the evaluative?  Formal and historicizing methods abound and are not generally challenged in the same way.

Good point about Bordieu.  Unfortunately I don't really know what I'm doing well enough to do more than sketch the surface of these ideas.

I could imagine making an argument for Pinter's poetry under several of these theories, and whether you would think that the political element was invalid or not would depend on which one you believed.  Let's say that I wrote about how forceful the poetry was, how scornful of "literary" values, how it rejoices in what Scott calls its emeticism and dares to be about something.  The sociologist would point to this as an implicit appeal to inverse classism, hence implicitly "political".  Then the lack of sterotypically esthetic value of the poems becomes a deliberate mirror of mass culture, the criticism of the poems becomes a mirror of the manipulation of mass culture by elites, who simultaneously use it for their own purposes (the English department is keep going by all those incoming students who need to be taught) and denigrate it to keep it in its place.  Is the problem that no such convenient narrative was supplied, or that it is inherently wrong?

I guess the classic example of anti-art being canonized as art are Duchamp's ready-mades.  The only real problem about making evaluative arguments defending anti-art is that you can only do it so many times.  I.e., once too many artists put toilet bowls or piles of poop in the galleries, it ceases to be interesting and becomes cliche.

Anyhow, I think that if the Nobel Prize committee were to make an aesthetic argument about Pinter's \_American Football\_, they would have an easier time with it if it were, say, a Dadaist poem written in the 1920s.  By now, however, this kind of argument would be much more difficult to make persuasively, although probably not impossible (as you say, there's no limit to critical ingenuity, although I hope there are limits to readers' credulity).  The poem just seems too predictable in the ways in which it is iconoclastic, which is just to say that Pinter doesn't really have his finger on developments in poetry (in contrast to the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, when he very much understood the field of avant-garde drama and crafted his plays as a contribution to it).
