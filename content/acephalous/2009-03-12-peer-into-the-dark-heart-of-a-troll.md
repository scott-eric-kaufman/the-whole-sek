In the comments to [this post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/like-what-i-did-with-the-dark-knight-only-this-time-about-the-fourth-issue-of-watchmenin-making-comics-scott-mccloud-argue.html), Paul [argued](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/like-what-i-did-with-the-dark-knight-only-this-time-about-the-fourth-issue-of-watchmenin-making-comics-scott-mccloud-argue.html?cid=148283761#comment-148283761):

The reader's attention when
reading a comic book is NOT drawn to the center of the panel, but
rather to the text and the portions of the image immediately
surrounding the text (Lachey et. al 1997). Do your homework before you
start spouting such nonsense! 
  

I searched for the reference.  Couldn't find it.  Why not?  I'll let Paul [explain](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/like-what-i-did-with-the-dark-knight-only-this-time-about-the-fourth-issue-of-watchmenin-making-comics-scott-mccloud-argue.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef011168f00a78970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef011168f00a78970c):

			

I'm
sure you don't have anything riding on this "argument," but I'm bored
at work and wanted to drop in and tell you that, on reflection, I see
that you're correct about pretty much all of it. 

(Certainly correct about using McCloud over Lachey et. al since that
was an invented citation. Hey, what can I say. All's fair in love and
being a troll?)


I ought to be more annoyed, as I did spend some time trying to dig up an invented citation.  But had Paul not trolled me, I would've been denied this opportunity to [speak with thunder](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/like-what-i-did-with-the-dark-knight-only-this-time-about-the-fourth-issue-of-watchmenin-making-comics-scott-mccloud-argue.html?cid=148974905#comment-148974905).  So all is fair.  (Just don't do it again.)

If you wanted to be persnickety, you might advise him that the period does not come after et, but after al.  Shortened for et alia.
