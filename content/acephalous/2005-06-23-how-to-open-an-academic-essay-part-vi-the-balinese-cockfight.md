[Episodes I, II, II/II, III, IV and V have been  [catalogued](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/how\_to\_open\_an\_academic\_essay/index.html) for your convenience.  Now I present the promised [installment](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/how\_to\_open\_an\_\_1.html) on The Balinese Cockfight.]

The origins of the cockfight in literary studies are shrouded in
mystery.  No mention of the cockfight appears in Stephen
Greenblatt’s formulaic introduction to “The Forms of Power
and the Power of Forms in the Renaissance” (_Genre_ 15: 1-2).  (Of that other New Historical tic, the one _not_
involving dead chickens, i.e. the chiasmus, the same cannot be said.)
The first appearance of the cockfight as “meta-social
commentary” occurs in Houston Baker’s [“To Move without Moving: An Analaysis of Creativity and Commerce in Ralph Ellison’s Trueblood Episode](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0030-8129%!(NOVERB)
