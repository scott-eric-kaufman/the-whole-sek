			The Other Scott already [noted](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2010/02/hack-of-day.html) Glenn Reynolds's tendentious [link](http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/93802/) and Steven Taylor's pithy [rebuttal](http://www.poliblogger.com/?p=17753)
of its underlying "logic," but I wanted to focus on the quotation from
Reynolds's reader in the update, because it points to a fundamental
disconnect between the rhetoric of the right and the left:  
I'm
guessing the "she's a socialist" part won't get talked about much in
the MSM. But if she had been a conservative it'd lead every evening
news cast for two months.The crucial difference between
this mass-shooting and other recent ones is that, for example, Nidal
Hasan didn't consider himself a liberal, nor did he devote himself to
liberal causes—he was, it seems, someone with pretensions to Islamic
jihad. Scott Roeder, however, shot George Tiller in the service of a _mainstream conservative cause_.
The difference, obviously, is not in the media's furtherance of a
narrative, but in the non-incidental relation of particular ideologies
with acts of violence.  

Conservatives complain 1) when liberals
ask that any brown person with a funny name not be labeled a jihadist
until evidence of such is unearthed, and 2) when mainstream news
outlets link the murder of prominent abortion doctors to conservative
causes. They fail to see the lack of equivalence: liberals don't
espouse jihad against the United States, but conservatives do inspire
those on their fringes to engage in _politically motivated violence_.
The politics of the George Tiller murder are an indictment against
conservative rhetoric because that rhetoric made Tiller a target;
whereas the personal politics of Amy Bishop are utterly irrelevant in
the absence of a vocal and sustained opposition to the existence of the
university and the tenure system among liberals.  

That
conservatives are working a false equivalence is made evident by
Reynolds's pathological desire to find evidence that will allow him to
turn this tragedy into mere political gamesmanship. Unlike his acolyte
Althouse, whose affected contrarianism runs so vast and deep she'll
write anything if she thinks one rube will do a double-take reading it,
Reynolds plays politics to win. He wants to own the narrative, and
because his platform trickles up into all the right places, he mostly
has a legitimate claim to it. In this case, he hikes over to
RateMyProfessor.com—a site that allows angry students to vent
anonymously after they receive grades they deserve—and finds a comment
in which an undergraduate calls her a "[socialist](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=392617&page=1)" and before you know it, [all the](http://gatewaypundit.firstthings.com/2010/02/socialist-alabama-professor-shot-3-colleagues-dead-shot-her-brother-dead-robbed-auto-dealership-with-shotgun-was-linked-to-attempted-harvard-bombing/) [usual suspects](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/socialist-serial-killer-amy-bishop.html) are employing "socialist" as an [anarthrous occupational nominal premodifier](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%!E(MISSING)myl/languagelog/archives/001628.html), _e.g._
"socialist Alabama professor," "socialist serial killer," etc. On the
strength, then, of a single comment by an upset undergraduate,
conservative hacks are folding socialism into what they imagine her
profession to be—be it a professor or a serial killer—in an attempt to
create the impression of equivalence between ideology and act where
none actually exists.  

At least not yet. (The day still being young and all.)

I don't think you can link mainstream conservative anti-abortion discourse to Tiller's violence any more than Jonah Greenberg can link any policy that increases the federal government to Nazi violence.

Ouch. I walked right into that one, didn't I?

_I don't think you can link mainstream conservative anti-abortion discourse to Tiller's violence..._

I don't think chocolate has anything to do with my weight: I'm sure it's the Diet Coke. 

Seriously, though, let's set some definitions. Would you consider "Abortion is murder" to be a mainstream anti-abortion theme, message, etc.?

Successful species should share their genes with less successful species?  From there it gets hazy and trends toward eugenics and bestiality...It's an odd discipline.  Between the eugenics and sheep f\*cking, it sort of sounds like what modern conservative intellectuals are doing to America.

Oh, and Scott, watch out.  Patrick has called the dogs on you again.  Prepare to be denounced by JD!

Millions of Americans oppose abortion, yet somehow don't resort to violence.  And yet, you blame the message for the acts of a deranged individual.  What about recruiting stations that have been attacked, and people killed?  Do you blame those who oppose the war (I'll get a double dose of blame as I oppose the war and abortion.  Lucky me.)

Place the blame where it belongs: with the person responsible.  Your comments are intellectually lazy.

"In history, the fetish of single cause is all too often only the insidious form of search for the responsible person -- hence a value judgment. The judge expresses it as: 'Who is right, and who is wrong?' The scholar is content to ask: 'Why?' and he accepts the fact that the answer may not be simple. Whether as a prejudice of common sense, a postulate of logicians, or a habit of prosecuting attorneys, the monism of cause can be, for history, only an impediment. History seeks for causal wave-trains and is not afraid, since life shows them to be so, to find them multiple. " -- Marc Bloch, The Historian's Craft, p. 193-194.

Some folks seem to be going out of their way to make sure that Hasan's religion (Islam) doesn't get mentioned. His leftist or rightist "cred" isn't even on their radar.

Denying that the slogan 'abortion is murder' encourages vigilante justice assumes either that wingnuts can't complete a syllogism or that they aren't tough on crime. Neither assumption seems consistent with the principle of charity.  Something similar could be said about the Marxist slogan 'property is theft', except that American Marxists are notoriously soft on crime.

Wait, I had a point but got distracted.

What to say in response to this piece of garbage?

Only thing to do is to take it apart piece by piece, I guess, kind of like a garbage picker.

\*The crucial difference between this mass-shooting and other recent ones is that, for example, Nidal Hasan didn't consider himself a liberal, nor did he devote himself to liberal causes—he was, it seems, someone with pretensions to Islamic jihad. Scott Roeder, however, shot George Tiller in the service of a mainstream conservative cause.\*

I'm sorry, the removal of U.S. troops from Iraq and Afg. is not a `mainstream liberal cause'?

It is about as mainstream as you can get; Nidal or whatever, chose to use violent methods to pursue that end.

do mainstream `liberals' (what you Americans call socialists) approve of the actions of the major.  Of course not.  do cons. approve of the actions of Roeder.  No, of course they don't.

but then, do mainstream cons. call abortionists `murderers' or `genocidalists'?  Please, if you have evidence of this, provide links.  do mainstream liberals accuse American soldiers of war crimes?  I'd ask you to ask John Murtha, but unfortunately he's dead.

\*The difference, obviously, is not in the media's furtherance of a narrative, but in the non-incidental relation of particular ideologies with acts of violence.\*

Which, is this were true, would see that mainstream `liberals' ideologies have more to do with a jihadi violence than does mainstream cons'tism with the act of Scott Roeder.

\*Conservatives complain 1) when liberals ask that any brown person with a funny name not be labeled a jihadist until evidence of such is unearthed, and 2) when mainstream news outlets link the murder of prominent abortion doctors to conservative causes.\*

Yes, you see that all the time: Conservatives complaining, whining, crying all the time when brown people with funny names are not automatically labelled terrorists!!!!!  It's a very common complaint... which is why, just after 9/11, Bush the younger turned around and said, `Condileeza?  What a funny name!  You're obviously brown and a terrorist!'

Oh wait, wasn't that the proprietor of this web log?

\*They fail to see the lack of equivalence: liberals don't espouse jihad against the United States, but conservatives do inspire those on their fringes to engage in politically motivated violence.\*

but again, mainstream `liberals' anti-anti-terrorism rhetoric is obviously more related to the attacks of major Nidal and of the 9.11 terrorists than anything mainstream conservatives have said.

\*That conservatives are working a false equivalence is made evident by Reynolds's pathological desire to find evidence that will allow him to turn this tragedy into mere political gamesmanship. Unlike his acolyte Althouse, whose affected contrarianism runs so vast and deep she'll write anything if she thinks one rube will do a double-take reading it, Reynolds plays politics to win.\*

Oh no!  the Rubes are doing double takes!  run for the hills!

You are right, in one regard, there is no equivalence.

Maintream `liberals' rhetoric and alliances give aid and comfort to fascist jihadis, a very large mass movement, while mainstream conservative give no such aid to anti-abortionist freaks... who are a very marginal no. compared to Islamic fascists. 

the rest blah, blah, blah...

numbskulls.

_Maintream `liberals' rhetoric and alliances give aid and comfort to fascist jihadis, a very large mass movement_

This may be the funniest sentence fragment ever written.  In 17 words, I count one lie, one thing factually untrue, and one pairing of words so internally inconsistent that it's very use shows the person using it is an incomparable douchebag or an historical illiterate.

Option C is, of course, both
