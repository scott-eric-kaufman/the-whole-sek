## Contemporary literature deserves better trolls.

When the _Huffington Post_ decided to byline Anis Shivani as "Writer," they were sorta onto something, because he's certainly not a "Reader."  By [his lights](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anis-shivani/the-15-most-overrated-con\_b\_672974.html#s123718), John Ashbery is "[m]ore responsible than anyone else for turning late twentieth-century  American poetry into a hermetic, self-enclosed, utterly private affair."  Which would be true, only it isn't, as confessional poets like Anne Sexton had long ago already planted a flag there.  But I'm not sure "Writer" fits him either, at least not as evidenced by his broadside against Amy Tan:

Helped deflect Asian-American writing's oppositional energies by  promoting convenient multicultural myths.  Her facile multicultural  template has had vast implications for the entire culture industry.   Flattened politics and history to private angst in depiction of minority  assimilation.  Empowered other immigrant writers to make mountains out  of the molehills of their minor adjustment struggles.

I think "Over-Writer" might have made for a more accurate byline.  (As I always tell my students, 99 percent of the time people write the word "facile," it's because their understanding of the topic is as superficial as the one they're dismissing.)  (Except when [I use it](http://www.google.com/search?q=site%!A(MISSING)http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)acephalous.typepad.com+facile&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a), because I'm a one-percenter, damn it.)  Consider his description of Jonathan Safran Foer's literary sins:

Always quick to jump on to the bandwagon of the moment.  Debuted with harmless multiculturalism for the perennially bored in _Everything Is Illuminated_,  with cute lovable foreigners and the slacker generation digging  lovableness; a more pretentious "magical realist" novel was never  written.

Anyone who believes _Everything Is Illuminated_ is the most pretentious magic realist novel ever written hasn't read many magic realist novels.

Not sure what you're on about with Sexton. Ashbery was her elder by a year. He won the Yale Younger Poets prize in 1956, while her first book was accepted for publication in 1959.

But more seriously, claims of the form "Avant-gardist X destroyed her art form by being too obscure/private/difficult" fail because there's no plausible causal mechanism that can preserve X's responsibility. If Ashbery was so terrible, why would anyone have imitated him?

Agreed. This was an atrocious little list. 

This is the sort of thing you write when your book of short stories on a vanity press ( [http://amzn.to/cFILeB](http://amzn.to/cFILeB) ) isn't getting any attention. You drum up some attention by beating on a drum and swearing loudly. 

He's clearly wrong on Foer, Diaz, Lahiri. But what is the point of bringing up Jorie Graham, Sharon Olds, John Ashberry on a list that also has Amy Tan (who is not taken very seriously at all to begin with -- and not at all "overrated")? It's simply incoherent. 

If he were a Facebook Friend, I would unfriend him.  

If I were Twitter's God, I would untrend him.

_Not sure what you're on about with Sexton. Ashbery was her elder by a year. He won the Yale Younger Poets prize in 1956, while her first book was accepted for publication in 1959._

He was a self-professed child of surrealism, and not closely associated with the school of confessional poetry (unless, as may have happened with Shivani, you confuse him John _Berryman_).  

_If Ashbery was so terrible, why would anyone have imitated him?_

The dictators who run MFA programs, according to the article.

_He's clearly wrong on Foer, Diaz, Lahiri. But what is the point of bringing up Jorie Graham, Sharon Olds, John Ashberry on a list that also has Amy Tan (who is not taken very seriously at all to begin with -- and not at all "overrated")?_

Hit the high-brow, hit the low-brow, and maybe someone will assume your work is in between?  Wait, let me look at that link again ... 

In these eleven stories of novelistic breadth and ambition, global tensions and harmonies come alive as rarely seen in contemporary fiction.

So as it turns out, _no_.

OK, I misguessed why you brought in Sexton -- you meant that it's "the confessionals" who are "responsible" for making our poetry "hermetic, self-enclosed, utterly private". I thought Shivani was dragging in Ashbery as a representative "difficult" poet, for a different sense of hermeticism -- poetry (supposedly) intelligible only to its author or to initiates.

_your book of short stories on a vanity press_

Is it a vanity press?  It doesn't look like that to me, unless we're using the phrase in totally difference senses.  A small press isn't even slightly the same thing.

I actually think this piece is quite spot on.

If you actually read Shivani's take on Ashbery, you'll see (a) he compares him unfavorably to Berryman, who he says, quite rightly, is more a truly visionary poet than Ashbery (and here he's going after Harold Bloom's and Helen Vendler's very popular notion that Ammons and Ashbery are the visionary heirs to the throne of Whitman), and (b) Shivani likes Ashbery's earlier work and quite rightly argues that Ashbery has been writing the same poem for 30 years.  

He goes after Amy Tan as a representative of a certain kind of very popular multiculturalism in which nothing's at stake.  His take on Tan, like his take on Olds and Gluck, suggest a coherent critical stance: all three pose as social or political voices of the minority or the voiceless, but all three exploit politics while taking no risks or making anyone feel terribly uncomfortable with themselves.  

Now, I don't know if I'd have gone after Tan.  Maxine Hong Kingston or Leslie Silko is probably a better example of this phenomenon, 'tho Silko at least pretends to take a radical poliical stance even as she markets her work to white middle class female book clubs.

He's spot on about Jorie Graham.  Her first three or four books are excellent, but since \*Regions of Unlikeness\*, she has crawled up her own asshole, equating the loss of her dog to the Holocaust and ultimately assuming that every piece of content of her consciousness is equivalent.  This is what Shivani means when he criticizes her faux-philosophical poetry.

As far as Foer goes, sure, it's not the most pretentious magical realist novel, but it's probably the most overrated pretentious magical realist novel. 

Back to Ashbery -- you're misreading what he means by turning poetry into a hermetic, self-enclosed private affair.  He's not talking about vanity or self-centeredness (which he attacks in Louise Gluck).  He's talking about the transformation of poetry into a self-enclosed block of non-referential language.  And here again he's completely right.  Ashbery is not the only influence, but he's the most popular, the one that has given the most license to young poets to write such verse.  And again, since \*The Tennis Court Oath\*, Ashbery hasn't taken any artistic risks, leaving it up to the next generation of Language Poets to suffer stupid attacks on their poetry while he finds crossover success in the mainstream (especially as his poetry backed down from the radical fragmentation of the \*Oath\* and he found a kind of airbrushed sheen for his parataxis.

And by the way, it's "Ashbery," not "Ashberry."

Vance:

It was the "utterly private" bit that sent me unthralling to the confessional poets, but I can see how that'd be applicable to someone like Ashbery too (though I never find him as willfully private as, say, Plath's references to Nazis).

GeoX:

It's difficult to tell with outfits that encourage submissions, run contests you have to pay to participate in, and highly recommend you purchase multiple copies of your own book from them.  I say that seriously: smaller outfits have been forced into the sort of gimmickry that once was limited to tried-and-true vanity, or outright scam presses.

Matthew:

If he'd actually written this:

If you actually read Shivani's take on Ashbery, you'll see (a) he compares him unfavorably to Berryman, who he says, quite rightly, is more a truly visionary poet than Ashbery (and here he's going after Harold Bloom's and Helen Vendler's very popular notion that Ammons and Ashbery are the visionary heirs to the throne of Whitman), and (b) Shivani likes Ashbery's earlier work and quite rightly argues that Ashbery has been writing the same poem for 30 years.

I'd see something more than a subjective assessment at work there.  But then he writes, about Vollmann:

Encapsulates ethical vacuity of American fiction after the collapse of 1970s postmodernism.

Because when I think of the _Seven Dreams_ series's brutal critique of clash of civilizations that was the repopulating of the North American continent by white people, the first words that come to mind are "ethical vacuity."  It's the sorta thing you might say about Vollmann if you've only ever read about him.  He's one of the most troubled and problematic novelists/journalists of the past half-century, but to claim that his ethics are vacuous is akin to dismissing the power of _Light in August_ because of how Faulkner struggles with his own racism therein.

James and Sean:

I am, apparently, not a percenter at all (nor do I want to be).

In general, it's really frustrating that people who write about authors being "overrated" tend to pay no attention to how they are, in fact, rated by mainstream critics. I mean Amy Tan is very widely thought of as an overly sappy middlebrow novelist, no? I've never read her, so I can't comment on the accuracy of that assessment, but it's ridiculous to pretend that Shivani's position is a daring, revolutionary one. Similarly, unqualified praise of Vollmann is pretty rare, and Shivani is far from the first person to point out that his books are rather long and dense.

Going back to your first point in the post, calling someone a "writer" reminds me of the History Channel's habit, when discussing Nostradamus or ancient astronauts or similar infuriating crap, of interviewing people who are identified below their names with credentials such as "author" or "Nostradamus expert," when they might as well just come out and say "crackpot."
