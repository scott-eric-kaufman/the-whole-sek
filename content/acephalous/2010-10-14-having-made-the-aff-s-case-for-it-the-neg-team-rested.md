To say Christine O’Donnell knows nothing about the responsibilities of a Senator to, for example, be able to name [_any_ Supreme Court decision she might deem objectionable](http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/odonnells-palin-moment/) is to state an already oft-stated obvious.  Less obvious, but much more  telling about her qualifications, were 1) the awkward, and often  illogical, segues between her desultory answers to questions and the  talking points she’d been told to deliver, and 2) the ignorance of her  and her staff about the basic mechanics of governing Delaware.  To treat  the second item first:

On the [_Chris Coons Fact Check_ blog](http://debate.christine2010.com/) created expressly for this debate is a post entitled “[Debate Fact Check: Chris Coons Says He Cares About Education](http://debate.christine2010.com/debate-fact-check-chris-coons-says-he-cares-about-education/),” the punchline of which “but his [latest 304-page document](http://www2.nccde.org/finance/Document/BudgetSummaryDocuments/FY2011%!C(MISSING)ABS%!s(MISSING)maller.pdf) about New Castle County’s priorities doesn’t mention the word ‘teacher’  even once.”  A quick survey of the document reveals that to be true;  however, it also fails to mention “errant behaviorists,” “cephalopod  psychologists,” “Italian sweater girls” or _anyone else whose employment or behavior is not overseen by the New Castle County Council_.\*  You would think someone running to represent Delaware would know that its educational system is [administered at the state and local levels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware#Education), and that the county’s only responsibility concerns the management of crossing guards.\*

But you would be wrong.

To address the first item, now, her ignorance of whose responsibility  it is to mention the word “teacher” is especially galling when you  consider that one of her debate strategies was to mention the word  “local” every chance she got, _e.g._

**O’DONNELL:** I believe that the local—I  was talking about what a local school taught and that should be  taught—that should be decided on the local community.  Local schools  should make that decision.

You can hear her coaching in that quotation: “If they mention  ‘evolution,’ don’t look scare away fiscal conservatives by claiming  science is a liberal plot to force us into homosexual relations with  monkeys.  Just repeat the word ‘local’ and the right people will feel  shiny and empowered.”  She employed the same tactic when addressing a  situation in which locally empowered people had already done what they  were empowered to do:

**O’DONNELL:** However, where the question  has come between what is protected free speech and what is not protected  free speech, the Supreme Court has always ruled that the community, the  local community has the right to decide.  And then the issue with the  “9/11 mosque,” that’s exactly where the battle is being fought, by the  community members who are impacted by that.

Even though she’s already been informed that “the local community”  had already exercised its “right to decide,” she believes that “the  local community” should continue exercising it until that second “e” can  flex into an “o” and purge Ground Zero from all things Islam.  That she  transforms “local” into “communities should keep deciding until they  decide in favor of my preferred answer” demonstrates that, like many a  conservative before her, the word is an invitation to an imposition  disguised in the rhetoric of Athenian democracy.

One particularly sad aspect of her performance is how brief she could  keep a talking point in her head, and how she apparently felt the need  to use it before it slipped her mind, _e.g._ 

**O’DONNELL:** At a time when he brags about  balancing the budget by raising our taxes, cutting policemen pay, this  is how he chooses to spend our tax dollars. We’ve got to ask, do we want  to send this gentleman to Washington, D.C.?  I would say no. He’s a  career politician who has proven he knows how to play the I’ll scratch  your back, you scratch mine game.

Two minutes later:

**O’DONNELL:** You’ve been criticized for  saying that you brought the county to Triple A bond rating. You  inherited that good rating. And how would you justify cutting the tax  exception for low income seniors and disabled seniors, cutting our  policeman pay when you wastefully spent so much money on appeasing the  special interest groups? You simply can’t justify that. That is a career  politician. That is cronyism. We don’t need any more of that in  Washington.

Then _nothing_ about it until her prepared closing statement.  Shortly thereafter, she remembered that she needed to implant the image  of Coons standing next to Obama in the minds of the audience:

**O’DONNELL:** When Barack Obama is standing  with you on a campaign trail this Friday, are you going to tell him  that you disagree with him on his immigration reform efforts?

Thirty seconds later:

**O’DONNELL:** Again, I would ask you, are  you going to tell President Obama that, that you disagree with him and  you think that illegal aliens should be deported.

That Coons already admitted he would inform the President of their disagreement is irrelevant to O’Donnell because **The Words Must Be Repeated**.   As a former debater, I can’t help but cringe with glee after watching  her a disastrous performance, but I’ll suppress the urge to yell “Chum  overboard!” because I’m an adult now. Which is why I’ll now stop  torturing the poor woman. Her performance speaks for itself and I’ll not  be a party to the unspeakable things it’s saying about her.

\*You would think that, in part, because you read as much in the  document that “doesn’t mention the word ‘teacher’ even once,” which her  staffers were too busy searching for the word “teacher” to read.

Glad to know we can agree on some political issues.  I still can not believe she is running and may get elected even knowing the fact that she knows nothing.  On the education issue, you may be interested in the Houston School Board is trying to find a way to better prepare their students for college. The top students seem to leave the system in 6th grade if they can afford to.  What they need is someone like you to help design a program based on your incoming Freshmen required course.  Perhaps then more will finish college and actually learn something that would prevent the elections of people who really do not know enough to help run our country!
