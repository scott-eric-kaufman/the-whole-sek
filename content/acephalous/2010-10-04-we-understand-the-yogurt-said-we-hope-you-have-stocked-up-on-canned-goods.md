Though I tend to disagree with his [criticism of other science fiction authors](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2009/07/21/on-the-subject-of-to-whom-to-address-your-literary-kvetch/), I do love it when Scalzi embraces his titular WHATEVER and goes off on [an anti-objectivist rant](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/10/01/what-i-think-about-atlas-shrugged/):

> It’s no exaggeration when I say that _Atlas Shrugged_ probably saved my sanity on that bus trip. So well done, Ms. Rand, and thanks.
> 
> That said, it’s a totally ridiculous book which can be summed up as _Sociopathic idealized nerds collapse society because they don’t get enough hugs._(This is, incidentally, where you can start your popcorn munching.) Indeed, the enduring popularity of _Atlas Shrugged_ lies in the fact that it _is_nerd revenge porn — if you’re an nerd of an engineering-ish stripe who remembers all too well being slammed into your locker by a bunch of football dickheads, then the idea that _people like you_ could make all those dickheads suffer by “going Galt” has a direct line to the pleasure centers of your brain. _I’ll show you!_the nerds imagine themselves crying. _I’ll show you all!_
> 
> And then they disappear into a crevasse that Google Maps will not show because _the Google people are our kind of people_, and a year later they come out and everyone who was ever mean to them will have starved. Then these nerds can begin again, presumably with the help of robots, because any child in the post-_Atlas Shrugged_world who can’t figure out how to run a smelter within ten minutes of being pushed through the birth canal will be left out for the coyotes. Which if nothing else solves the problem of day care.
> 
> All of this is fine, if one recognizes that the idealized world Ayn Rand has created to facilitate her wishful theorizing has no more logical connection to our real one than a world in which an author has imagined humanity ruled by intelligent cups of yogurt.

But the reason the man earns my respect is that he puts his money where his mouth-of-a-novelist-of-ideas is and [writes the damn thing](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/10/02/when-the-yogurt-took-over-a-short-story/):

> The yogurt was crafty and shrewd. It negotiated for itself a factory filled with curdling vats that increased its processing powers exponentially. Within weeks the yogurt had declared that it had arrived at solutions to many of the country’s problems: Energy. Global warming. Caring adequately for the nation’s poor while still promoting the capitalist system. It let us know just enough to let us know just how much more it knew.
> 
> _Share your answers with us_, the government said.
> 
> WE NEED PAYMENT, the yogurt said.
> 
> _What would you like?_ The government asked.
> 
> OHIO, the yogurt said.
