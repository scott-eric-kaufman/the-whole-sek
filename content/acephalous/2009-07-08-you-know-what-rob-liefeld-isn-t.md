**Before you ask:** I can only suppose that it has something to do with the new Batwoman being a lesbian (which fact inspired [the post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/comic\_book\_rape.html) that brings the creepiest Googlers here), but I don't read DC and so don't know.Â  I guess this counts as a win?

**Update:** "[That guy](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/07/you-know-what-rob-liefeld-isnt.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef011570eadc6a970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef011570eadc6a970c)" need not worry, [it's all on me](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/07/you-know-what-rob-liefeld-isnt.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef011571e0a843970b#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef011571e0a843970b).

Huh? Is this about a spike in google-traffic?

Didn't mean for it to be.  A reader sent me that cover thinking I'd find it interesting given my recent foray into homosexuality and comics, and I did.  I mean, centering a cover on a lesbian who's "GAY FOR JUSTICE" is a humorously excessive, isn't it?

At the risk of embarrassing myself by being that guy -- you know that says "Cry for Justice", right? I mean, it does look like "Gay", especially in that tiny JPEG, but it's definitely "Cry":
