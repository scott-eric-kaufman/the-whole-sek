## Easy Erudition, Anyone?

[_X-posted_ _to the Valve_]

So I'm reading Jonathan Arac's [_Critical Genealogies: Historical Situations for Postmodern Literary Studies_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1583481125/diesekoschmar-20) this afternoon and am flat dumbstruck by the erudition displayed therein.  After dashing through the complete works of [Harold Bloom](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=/gp/search%!F(MISSING)%!i(MISSING)ndex=books%!k(MISSING)eywords=Harold%!B(MISSING)loom%!\(MISSING)_encoding=UTF8)—which is akin to dashing through the Western canon once-removed, no mean feat in itself—he surveys the response to what he calls the "theory boom" in American literary studies.  He possesses an intimate familiarity with _everything_, passing judgments on Bloom's wavering allegiances here, the adoption of M.H. Abram's notion of "heterocosm" there, Geoffrey Hartman's Nietzschian rhetoric yonder ... and so on _ad infinitum_.  

I don't dip my quill in Latin ink just to be pretentious, either.  The man seems to have had the requisite infinity needed to read what he's read.  I don't have that kind of time.  I suppose I have to accept the fact that I'll never title a chapter "The History of Romanticism in Contemporary Criticism."  I could cry.  Or write a PSA:
Parents, start your children reading contemporary criticism young.  If they haven't read the complete Keats and W.J. Bate's _[John Keats](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674478258/diesekoschmar-20)_ by five, their first tenure review may well be their last.

The best I can do is read Arac's chapter _about_ the history of Romanticism in contemporary criticism and hope I remember enough to pass for someone reasonably well-read.  Only throwing it in the memory well isn't enough.

It has to float.  

Or I have to find some way to fake it.  The intellectual equivalent of what us Southerners call "floaties."  Because honestly, how does one fake dizzying erudition?  Slap a quote from here, there and one from there, here?  Rewrite the books no one remembers reading or _even having written_ anymore?  Wait a minute, that baby's buoyant.  You know, if Arac's book weren't written so damn well, I'd probably be rewriting right now.  Sentence-by-sentence.  Learning what he means by revising how he says it.  By the time I finished, I'd know what he knew but has long forgotten _and_ have myself a manuscript with what credit card companies call a "pre-approved stamp of approval."  

Plagiarism is the only option, people.  There's no way we can read that much.  Come to think of it, there's no way _he_ could've read that much.  I'm tempted to say that everything ever written isn't a footnote _to_ Plato but a plagiarism _of_ him.  The continuity of the Western tradition must be the result of a massive fraud.  No other explanation fits.  

Maybe now I can sleep without the nagging feeling I ought to be dousing the midnight oil with pages from Frye's _[Anatomy of Criticism](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691069999/diesekoschmar-20)_ ...

Cf. the preface (is that it?) to Don Quixote.

Sorry, fella, the only massively erudite person I've ever known -- Alan Watson in Athens Georgia -- was very much "the real thing".  Watson knows about twenty languages, and has clear and fresh interpretations of anything from Aesop's fables to Portugese slave law to Tiberian religious cults.  A brilliant systematic brain, and a charming, compassionate outlook without a trace of snobbishness.  Watson sometimes gets reviewed with the same objection you make: "one need not need to prove that he is a fraud, because no single person could have mastered so many disparate texts".  Just as there are only a couple brilliant musicians or a few chess Grandmasters in every generation, there are maybe five or six truly gifted academics at any given time.  Putting them on the same level with the rest of us is every bit as wrong as accusing Michael Jordan of "faking" when he was in his prime.

Oh, and what are the rest of us doing?  Keeping the seats warm?

George, I think you've misunderstood me.  _Pace_ Alex, I think most of us are seat-warmers, not that genuinely erudite people don't exist.  

That said, I don't think the language thing is tied to it.  That's a different skill-set.  My wife, who's not yet erudite--but one day will be--is one of those language/music people.  She knows seventeen languages, I think.  (I have a hard time keeping track since some of them, like Provencal and Anglo-Saxon, she doesn't have many opportunities to speak.  But being able to travel anywhere in Europe except the Basque region is kind of awesome.)

Wow, I've never been paced before...Scott, you've disarmed me.
