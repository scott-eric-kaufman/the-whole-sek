## You Can Only Hope To Contain Me

Because you can't stop a man when hypergraphia grips him.  Briefly:

*   If you're into dissertation pangs, _[Acephalous](http://acephalous.typepad.com/)_ is where you'll find me writing about them. *   If literary theory tickles your fancy, you can find me on [_The Valve_](http://thevalve.org/).
*   If you like the historical arcana and/or the political posts, feel free to join me, Ari and Eric on [_The Edge of the American West_](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/the-guy-from-that-place-you-know-the-one-that-thing-happened-to/). 

As I [mention here](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/loose-the-screaming-flying-babies/#comment-11432), I think this move makes sense.  Feel free to disagree.  But before you do, consider this: whenever I write about politics here, I feel like I'm violating the spirit of the place.  [_Insert Ivory Tower crack_]  This seems to me the best way to keep all my readers satisfied.

But I've been wrong before.

_all my readers_

It's sweet that you pretend not to know that it's always been only me and a bucket of pseudonyms.

What? I want my snarkery in an easy one-stop package, a full-service blog where they clean windows and check your  oil while filling the tank. How can you not combine the dissertation madness with the chewy goodness of political punditry? Especially when finishing the dissertation soon means you'd largely be shutting down this site. 

And Ari: Hi, me! Good to see me again.

Ari Roberts here, popping by to say to Scott: more blogs!  Yes!  More and more!  _More_ I say!  Scott ... three or four more, on top of these, and I'd say you'll really have something.

You need to have a separate personal blog, too, for your life.  Also if we could get more detail on your bowel movements, preferably on yet another blog, everyone in the world would be happier.

Oh, great: _another_ blog to read. With multiple authors, no less. 

For what it's worth, I've never felt like any of your political posts were out of line with the rest of what you do here. It's such a wide mix, because it's _your_ blog; anyone who has a problem with that doesn't grok.
