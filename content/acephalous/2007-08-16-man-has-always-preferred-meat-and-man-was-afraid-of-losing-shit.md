(_This is a guest post by renowned poet and playwright [Antonin Artaud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonin\_Artaud)_.)

Hello.    
Who am I?    
I am always Antonin Artaud.  

As I write this   
you will imagine   
my present body   
BURSTING INTO SHARDS,   
then remade under   
the heinous auspices   
of my new body   
and you will never forget me.  

I am on [my space](http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=175883032&blogID=269574576)  
in a means  
DISSECTED  
by my space  
or on it.

But it could   
just as well  
not be me  
not be linked to me  
but to them.

Alongside their appetite  
for living  
is the enthroned appetite  
for food  
to transform   
into shit  
which they fear  
they will lose.

I will not lose your shit.

But there is a thing  
which is a something   
the only one thing  
which is a something  
which I feel  
because it wants  
TO GET OUT.

It is your shit   
and I will not lose it.

I will empower it  
with magnets  
and hold it down  
by sordid influence  
and by  
SITTING.

Others "sustain emphatically  
that [I] the discursive tropes   
of metaphor and metonymy  
in [my] praxis of  
CINEMATIC NARRATION  
in order to attain  
a poetic deferment  
of meaning."

Others are wrong.  
Their shit will be lost.

_Nouveau message._

What is a [DEPOSIT](http://antoninartaud.org/guestbook.mv?parm\_func=view)  
I am asked.  
Hello I love your  
[HONDA](http://antoninartaud.org/guestbook.mv?parm\_func=view)  
they declare.

I should buy   

PHENTERMINE
  
and   
[PLAY DATING](http://antoninartaud.org/guestbook.mv?parm\_func=view)  
and   
my mind will  
be a [VOID](http://antoninartaud.org/guestbook.mv?parm\_func=view).

BUT SHRUG.

ANT FARM.

BUT SHRUG ANT FARM.

I never fell for this guy. Intrigued, yes. But never head-over-heels.

Me neither.  It was finding the "dissertation" published on MySpace that inspired me tonight.  I've been looking at the alternative venues for scholarly publication -- trying to find the bottom of the bottom of the barrel -- and came across it earlier.  I'm not speaking to the quality of the publication so much as its means of publication.  Granted, I don't think much of that particular publication, but it's not bat-shit insane, merely formulaic.  Sadly, there's something to be said for that.

Also, I've been giggling all night repeating "but shrug ant farm" to myself.  I don't know why, but that phrase gives me the everlasting giggles.  (Once you alter the emphases, of course.)

Oh Artaud  

I have always loved your work  

THE SOLAR ANUS   

Fuck  

That was no Artaud, but Bataille  

You poseur  

You were never so surreal  

as that master [_Acephale
