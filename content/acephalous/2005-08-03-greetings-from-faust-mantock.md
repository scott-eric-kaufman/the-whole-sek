[Note: entries time-stamped around now are never a good sign]

Via the lingusitics blog [Seredipity](http://serendipity.lascribe.net/blogologie/2005/08/nom-de-blog/?lp\_lang\_view=en): a [pen-name generator](http://www.up.univ-mrs.fr/cgi-veronis/alcofribas?nom=Scott+Eric+Kaufman&Generer=G%!E(MISSING)9n%!E(MISSING)9rer).  Instead of turning your name into actual words, it transforms it into word-like words.  More fun below the fold.

For example, "Scott Eric Kaufman" becomes:
Triston Facuackem  
Francisco Ettumak  
Macknair Efuctost

If I exclude my middle name the selection's even better:
Faust Mantock  
Mack Tanofuts  
Kata Monfucts  
Fon Amucktat  
Tamas Fuckon  
Stu Matonfack

The
"c" and "k" in my name seems to incline the generator to the vaguely
pornographic.  The Little Womedievalist, on the other hand:
Angell Women  
Manon Welleg  
Engel Walmon  
Allow Gemenn

Had she taken on my name when we married, she could've been an African caricature:
Kane Fumamang  
Kenna Famamgu  
Muna Kefamang  
Fem Gamananku

That was fun.  _To the Dissertation-Mobile!_

They were a bit befuddled by "Schryer."  Here's what they came up with:

Cynth PHERESSER  

Psyche RENTHERS  

Cressy PHRENTHE  

Cherry PSENTESH  

Perry HESENTSCH  

Chessy RENERPHT  

Nessy PHTRERCHE  

Henry PHRETSCES  

Hester RENCHYPS  

Ness PYTHERCHRE

I guess "Psyche Renthers" sounds kind of cool, if I wanted a woman's pen-name.  Most of the rest I can't pronounce.
