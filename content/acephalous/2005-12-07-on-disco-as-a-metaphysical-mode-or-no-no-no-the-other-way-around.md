## On Disco as a Metaphysical Mode; or, No No No, the Other Way Around

The year is 1997.  The place is Louisiana State University.  The dippy fellow with the faded Mets cap and frazzled look following [Pat McGee](http://www.english.lsu.edu/dept/fac/prof/pmcgee/970699585) to his office is Yours Truly.  I wanted to talk to him about why I'd received a B on a paper I'd written about Irish nationalism in [_A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0142437344%!F(MISSING)qid%!D(MISSING)1134006757)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1).  As we walked down the hall, he asked "What criticism have you read?"  I mumbled my appreciation for [William Gass](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0801484898)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) (whose work I had learned of via [the most confusing editorial assignment in the history of American literature](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0140187081)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1)) and [Camille Paglia](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0679735798)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) (whose work I did _not_ learn about while reading [_Playboy_](http://privat.ub.uib.no/BUBSY/playboy.htm) for the articles).  To which he responded:

"I meant criticism about Joyce's novel."

Now you see why I earned a B on that particular essay.  The point of encumbering you with this trivia?[[1]](#1)  Today I learned that the Queen of Off the Cuff Cultural Studies has resumed writing her column for [Salon](http://www.salon.com) with (predictably) [a review](http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2005/12/02/madonna/) of Madonna's latest album.  The atrophy of her once prodigious talent saddens me.  The article actually contains the following sentences:
That's not what we got—though you'd never know it from the gushing
reviews, which applauded the CD for achieving Madonna's purported aim
of making people dance. My blood boiled at this insulting reduction of
dance music to gymnastics—mere recreational aerobics. I for one do _not_ dance to dance music; disco for me is a lofty metaphysical mode that induces contemplation.

The woman I once thought one of the best minds of my time said "disco for me is a lofty metaphysical mode that induces contemplation."  What?  I can barely parse that sentence, much less make sense of its absurd implications.  How can something which is external to you be a mode you experience internally?  Maybe something can inspire contemplation of matters metaphysical, but I'm unable to see how something can be a metaphysical mode.  By definition, metaphysical modes have a difficult time being.  Part and parcel of the whole metaphysical gig, I thought.  Paglia apparently disagrees . . . and chose to voice her disagreement in one of the worst sentences ever written.  But not the worst.  One commenter topped her in a lucid reply entitled "[Camille Paglia is a tight ass](http://letters.salon.com/ent/feature/2005/12/02/madonna/permalink/d46ffab5da8ec57f6735ef4ec7d34867.html)":
This lady should loosen her sphincter and shake her ass . . .

. . . but preferably not in that order.

[[1]]()  According to the [_OED_](http://www.oed.com/), "encumber" means "to hamper, embarrass _with_ a clog or burden."  I'm not sure whether it's the emphasis on the word "with," the incongruous nature of clogs and burdens or the idea of someone embarrassing me _with_ a clog _or_ a burden, but I haven't spit on my keyboard in quite some time, so I thought I'd share.

There are also musical modes, the Myxolydian for instance, which Paglia might have been reaching for a reference to.

Well, I've been thinking about this for 24 hours now and have decided that I ought to post the only possible metaphysical connection that I can come up with in relation to disco: my mind/spirit leaves my body whenever I hear it.  In other words, I go metaphysical.  

And I came of age in the midst of the disco era. I am so sorry that I cannot do better than that.  There just really isn't any "there" there.
