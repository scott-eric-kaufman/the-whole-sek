			**SEK'S NEIGHBOR:** (_standing beneath a tree, yelling into SEK's window_) HEY, ARE THESE YOUR STICKS?

**SEK:** (_under his breath_) Don't say "they're probably the tree's," don't say "they're probably the tree's," don't say "they're probably the tree's."

**SEK:** (_out his window_) THEY'RE PROBABLY THE TREE'S!

**SEK'S NEIGHBOR:** SO THEY'RE NOT YOURS? I CAN THROW THEM AWAY?

**SEK:** YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH THEM!

**SEK'S NEIGHBOR:** SO I CAN THROW THEM AWAY?

**SEK:** SURE!

**SEK'S NEIGHBOR:** BECAUSE I'M GOING TO THROW THEM AWAY!

**SEK:** GO AHEAD!

 **SEK'S NEIGHBOR:** IN THE TRASH!

**SEK:** GOOD JOB!

 **SEK'S NEIGHBOR:** THANKS!

**SEK:** YOU'RE WELCOME!

 **SEK'S NEIGHBOR:** GOOD TALK!
