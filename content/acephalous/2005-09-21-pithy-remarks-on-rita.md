As a friend (and current Louisiana resident) wrote this afternoon:

[Once](http://technorati.com/tag/%!C(MISSING)%!h(MISSING)urricane%!k(MISSING)atrina%!C(MISSING)%!#(MISSING)taglink) is a [catastrophe](http://technorati.com/tag/katrina#taglink).  [Twice](http://technorati.com/tag/rita#taglink) looks like [a grudge](http://technorati.com/tag/%!h(MISSING)urricane+rita%!#(MISSING)taglink).

**Update**: The Washington Post informs us that "[Rita Upgraded to 'Monster' Category 5 Hurricane](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/21/AR2005092100297.html)." ([CNN confirms](http://www.cnn.com/2005/WEATHER/09/21/rita/index.html).)  Has the National Hurricane Center always applied such adjectives to hurricanes?  Can one Category 5 be "beastly" and another "indifferent"?  Or are all Category 5 hurricanes "Monster" by definition?  (I kid, frankly, because I don't like the alternative emotional responses.)

For the record, I'm experimenting with tags right now to see how useful they could be for my literary journalism course blog.  A set of tags specific to the course could be an excellent way for myself (and my students) to quickly organize information.
