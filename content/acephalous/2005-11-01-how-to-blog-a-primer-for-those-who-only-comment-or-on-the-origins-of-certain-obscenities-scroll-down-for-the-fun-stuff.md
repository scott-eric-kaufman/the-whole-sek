[_Ramblings of a Sudafed Stein_]

First and foremost, if you hope to have an audience outside your circle of friends, you must have one thought per day about a thing other people care about.  Like today I sat down and thought how wonderful it would be to think about adjectives this afternoon.  What does prose look like with them?  What does it look like without them?  Why do we gender the relative distribution of adjectives?  Why do too many make sentences sound "feminine" and not enough make sentences sound "masculine"?  What is it about precision that reflects upon our respective genitalia?  

Then I sit.  You may wonder why I specify that since I have probably been sitting the entire time.  Which I have.  So I add in the interest of wily womanish precision that "Then I continue to sit."  Because I could have stood up and paced.  I could have waved my arms—I could be waving them right now—instead I continue my sedent defiance of motion.  So I say to you again as I have said that I am and have been seated for some time as I compose this post.  So I sit thinking about adjectival precision and external organs of generation and wondering whether the audience I imagine into existence nightly will think a post about gender and exactness worthy of wasting 13 minutes reading.  But the point is that I sit.  Sitting is important.  Only if you sit can you learn anything about yourself.  Could Gertrude Stein have composed the following standing up or astride some beast of locomotion?
Identity is funny being yourself is funny as you are never yourself to yourself except as you remember yourself and then of course you do not believe yourself . . . . you do not really believe yourself why should you, you know so well so very well that it is not yourself, it could not be yourself because you cannot remember right and if you do remember right it does not sound right and of course it does not sound right because it is not right.  You are of course never yourself.

No I do not think she could why do you think she could because she could not have.  Reading Gertrude Stein may be hazardous to your prose or if not hazardous then a hazard which you would avoid if you could avoid but you cannot avoid because you cannot.  See what I mean?  So you sit there to compose your post instead of moving around to move around like the way Darwin designed people to and then you write down what you think about precision and penises and vaginas.  In an act of pure puerility you consider what you could say about the plural of the noun "penis."  "What is the plural of 'penis'?" you could ask and then you could say that while investigating this most mysterious mystery you tripped over the word "penintime" with all the grace of a shitface and momentarily thought to consider this word which means "innermost but one" as akin to "Hammertime" only pathetically juvenile.  Yes that would be what you would think were you a blogger.  Then you would investigate the etymology of "shitfaced" and learn that this quintessential Southern regionalism originates most loftily in the work of High Modernism you came here to study:

THE GONG

Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.

(_The brake  cracks  violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged,  out of the track. The motorman  thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys_)

THE MOTORMAN

Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?

And you would think how amazing it must be that so low a word as "shitface" came from a source considered now so high.  Then you remember that this paragon of Modernism hit the shores as utter samizdat and that those who "knew better" considered it pornographic and filed suit to prove it so.  

Then you think about how wonderful it is to think that literature was once important enough to be banned.  Then you remember that all these thoughts have been thought before by your betters and decide they belong not on your blog.  Then you unintentionally write a sentence with unconventional syntax and wonder where this sign falls on the continuum of good and bad.  So you sit reading the Oxford English Dictionary and pondering whether you should communicate what you now know to people who do not subscribe to your tremendously narrow view of the Word World.

Then you realize that you should not write anything at all.  That every word you write which hits the web starves your future of all potential substenance.  That you should chug the cough suppressant and be done with thinking thoughts better thought by thinkers able to think their thoughtlets into some sense.  But then you think that you've brought your brilliance to the brightsmith and that that ought to be enough to justify your thoughts but then the alarums peal their pesky notes and you know your thoughts are through.  

Fit with cement boots and booted into the bay.

Then you look up the adjective "fuckered" and learn that the word "fuckwind" derives from the word "windfucker" and are off on another tangent.  Needless to say you realize that it is almost three in the afternoon and you've already purchased the potatoes you'll serve your people come dinner.  Now you need to polish.  So when six o'clock comes around you edit the mess you made into something entertainingly incoherent and you understand it all and it means nothing.  Then you cough and cough and cough and hit post anyway.

Stein does that to a person she does indeed.  In the words of Khlebnikov's translator,

Hlahla!  Ufhlofan, lauflings!  

Hlahla!  Ufhlofan, lauflings!  

Who lawghen with lafe, who hlaehen lewchly,  

Hlahla!  Ufhlofan hlouly!

Rebecca, I suppose I should know who Khlebnikov and his translator are, but to be honest, I don't.  You overestimate my intelligence.  That said, my Sudafed-addled brain found [this poem](http://www.mayakovsky.com/khleb/poem4.htm) of his delightful.  Not that I know what it means, mind you . . .

Ha!  I find it instructive to compare and contrast

_Hlahla! Ufhlofan, lauflings!  

Hlahla! Ufhlofan, lauflings!  

Hlahla! Ufhlofan hlouly!_

with the inadvertently Gertrudesteinish

And Rich was implying that poetry today is more dead than alive!

...and now that you've (quite properly) deleted the 'blackjack-cheat' spam, my comment looks even more oblique and postmodern!  Marvellous.
