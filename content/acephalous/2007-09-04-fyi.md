voncookie, that's the nicest thing anybody's said to me all day.  Only, what the fuck are you doing here saying it?  Don't you realize WORK BIRD CAN STILL SEE YOU?

I think Work Bird is pissed he didn't make it into "The Custom-House."

I took the suggestion above and made WORK BIRD my desktop... I've already finished my second draft of my Fulbright proposal and it's not even 10 a.m.  Thanks, Work Bird!
