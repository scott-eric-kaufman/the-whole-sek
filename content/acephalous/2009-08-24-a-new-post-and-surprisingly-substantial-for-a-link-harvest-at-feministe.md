_Iâ€™ll pretend, for the moment, that my lapsed faith is the forgiving one and not the one where the Big Whatsit is all about the smiting._

We're not the ones who claim that hurricanes do God's wet-work. We had theodicy beaten out of us by the Romans. And the Christians. And the Germans. etc.

Let me see: ten plagues, a half dozen cities (Sodom, Gommorrah, Jericho, a couple others), internal purges (Korach, etc.), at least one genocide, and a couple of war crimes....

Yeah, I think that ship's sailed. They're hip.
