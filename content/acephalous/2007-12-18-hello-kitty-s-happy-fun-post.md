This is where all the nasty comments people want to leave on [the other thread](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/some-people-ear.html) now belong.  By all means, say what you will ... just remember who you're saying it in front of.

(Also: the first person to contact someone's employer _loses the Internets._ I'm [not kidding](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/refined\_white\_s.html).)

For the record, J.S. Nelson [won the Internets](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/some-people-ear.html#comment-93548672) a few days back.  Sometimes I wonder why I even try.

Feel free to raid my archives for more cuteness from Japanese pop culture.  You may have to deploy _My Melody_ down the road, is all I'm saying.

In response to a question below

_Who is JP?_

God if I know. I think I decided that Patterico's first name was "Jason," but I have no idea where I got that: maybe it's the echo of one of the dustups in various spots over the years. But his blog doesn't give his first name, and lord knows if he doesn't make his first name easy to find, I'm not trolling, I mean trawling for it. Let's just assume that I meant it to stand for _Just_ Patterico and leave it at that.

Okay?

At first I thought your "Happy Fun Post" was going to lead with the news that all was right with the world:  

*   that you've been reinstated as a UCI student with profuse apologies from both the Chancellor and the Governator,

*   that the karmic cycle was thrown back into whack when The Library encountered students having sex in _its_ office,

*   that your oncologist has deemed your cancer to be permanently in remission and that Rachel's tumors likewise have gone the way of the dodo,

*   that your erstwhile Stalker has been apprehended for, I don't know, tax evasion or some such, and has been locked away until the coming of Elijah,

*   that your vehicular assailant has had an attack of conscience and tracked you down via the internets solely to write you a middle-six-figure check,

*   and that your impending dissertation means that you have a passel of interviews slated for the MLA.  

But alas, the smiling countenance of Hello Kitty was nought but a cruel ruse beguiling me into _thinking_ that happy pictures meant, you know, happy things had happened.  

_Damn you_, Hello Kitty!

Karl Steel: "Rich doesn't foreground his profession, whatever it is, as an authenticating device. He has, instead, facts. And bile."

If only I could figure out what my profession is.  Seriously, it's difficult.  But of course everyone here knows the answer I usually give.

(to the vaguely remembered tune of half-a-dozen drinking songs)

In the bar, with the rest of the crew  

Sometimes they'll talk of Rich P  

He was the scurviest scalawag  

That sailed the stacks instead of the seas

Oh, the freelance librarian's life for me  

And the dynamically created Web site  

The hits come in, asleep or awake  

So stupid poems there's time to write

[Begin Chorus]

Facts, stupid poems, and bile, my friends  

Facts stupid poems and bile  

Oh we'll make a database or a graph  

Or a mocking rhyme, and then a laugh  

We're not settled down on a permanent staff  

Not for us fetching books with a smile --  

We'll bring facts, stupid poems, and bile

[End Chorus]

Oh looking out at this country of ours  

And tracking what's been done to it  

With pollution records, corruption too  

Why be nice to right-wing twits?

And the use of one's name is a badge of the free  

No worries about people to offend  

After lawsuit threats from multinationals  

Internet stalkers don't seem like the end

[Chorus]

So hoist another one for Rich P  

Librarian, or maybe public access database guy  

Or consultant of some kind to activist groups  

Maybe he'll figure it out by and by

Rich, you are one heck of a writer. Had to follow this Adkins phenom, and honestly, I can't figure out if the guy's real.  It's like a parody, like LonelyGirl15 or something.  

I have to wonder if Adkins is a take-off on 'protein' -- as in the Atkins diet, and maybe an inside joke on Protein Wis-dom.  Maybe we've all been punk'd!

Anyway, you do indeed have a persona just as much as the folks in question here (not counting Chuckie out of Michigan).  So keep writing, keep righting, and keep on fighting. It all makes for good reading. Scott's excellent as well. Glad I found this site. (PS- any traveler would love 'Rosy Angel'. Terrific.)

I just took a look over at the P-blog, and they seem to be congratulating him for politely responding to all the comments people aimed at him in the other thread. 

I must have missed something.  He didn't answer a single one of mine.

For those who want to return to the Kerry info  

I'd recommend   

[http://www.mekong.net/random/malkin.htm#nlink97](http://www.mekong.net/random/malkin.htm#nlink97)

This is one of the best Malkin analysises I have seen. He crucifies her Defense of Internment claims and addresses the Kerry wounds very well. Unlike Eric Muller he wraps it up in a couple of well written paragraphs - Muller took on the internment debate in a very lengthy posting - informative but very long.

As for Patty boy - he won't answer questions that don't make him look smart.

" i beat the internet  

 the end guy is hard"

Seriously though I always like getting mentioned because as a non-blogger, I live vicariously through other people's posts. I just wish that lately it hadn't been under circumstances involving dark prophecies, etc.  Seems like when I'm not recounting a tale of my own woe, I'm offhandedly anticipating yours.

Hello.  Re Malkin playing fast and loose with the facts, I was surprised brought up this:

[http://www.isthatlegal.org/archives/2005/05/nine\_months\_lat.html](http://www.isthatlegal.org/archives/2005/05/nine\_months\_lat.html)

Makin had to retract and apologize, but only after 9 months and legal action was threatened.  Maybe even Patterico would admit that making a libelous smear and then stonewalling about it is playing fast and loose with the facts, but I doubt it.

Scrumptious,

_I don't think he mentioned in that interview to the Crimson that he attempted to obtain a deferment, just that he asked his draft board about it. In the end it would have been a deferment, though._

Here is what the Crimson article stated:

When he approached his draft board for permission to study for a year in Paris, the draft board refused and Kerry decided to enlist in the Navy.

In an interview with Senator Kerry in 2003, the Boston Globe wrote the following:

As graduation approached, Kerry knew that he had three choices: be drafted, seek a deferment for graduate school, or join up and position himself to become an officer. ``It was clear to me that I was going to be at risk,'' Kerry recalled. ``My draft board . . . said, `Look, the likelihood is you are probably going to be drafted.' I said, `If I'm going to be drafted, I'd like to have responsibility and be an officer.' '

From both the Crimson and the Globe article, it appears as if Kerry actively sought an alternative to service in Vietnam.  This, of course, does not take away from Senator Kerry's service or actions in Vietnam, but I think it provides important context to the discussion. 

_Not trying to diss your point, just pointing out the distinction._

No dissing at all perceived!  If we're aiming for accuracy, let's make sure I'm accurate too.

Dan Collins: I meant the guy was possibly a creation designed to get hits and agitate people. The name, maybe riffing on a well-known blog as its starting point. I didn't mean the blog was connected to Protein Wisdom. 

Anyway, it looks like this kid is real. Birthdate, home phone and address right there on the worldwide web. Geez. Hope he stays in Michigan. How did Townhall hook up with this one...

_Whatever that means._

It means that I found Senator Kerry to be an individual who did not seem disconnected from reality.  It means that, in my estimation, Senator Kerry does not seem the type to exaggerate his service.

_Bush looks into people's eyes and thinks he sees something there, and Patterico fantasizes about having a beer with Scott._

OK?  I'm afraid I'm a little lost on what this has to do with Senator Kerry or President Bush.

_Give me facts.any day, for example, which rich kid checked what box back in the 60s. Fuck "genuine."_

I believe that you may use the term "fact" quite loosely in your everyday life.  Good day.

Rich Puchalsky

For whatever reason, the spam filter is refusing to let me post a response.  I promise you it isn't filled with invective of any sort, and I'll keep trying.  Any idea on why the spam filter is working overtime at this point?

TO ALL:

Have a Happy Holidays and I wish you all the best!

Yeah, there's another drinking song for Scott waiting in the queue somewhere.  The spam filter is getting everybody.

(_Stupid spam filter.  Here it is._)

Vermont Neighbor, thanks.  Jake and Karl, it appears that drinking songs may be my poetic metier, so to speak.

Here's one for Scott:

[Begin chorus]

They tell of a man from Californiay  

Who thought that his diss would be done some day   

The Devil looked up, said "I'll make him pay"  

So drink one for the troubles of SEK

[end chorus]

Now SEK's list of trials is long  

And we'll see who's still standing after this song   

He was beat up in high school, he didn't belong   

But it was in grad school that things went wrong

[Chorus]

The doctor told him about his thyroid  

He didn't want his wife to be annoyed  

"If I hide it from everyone I'll stay employed"  

So four months of concealment he enjoyed

[Chorus]

Now SEK came to his office door  

And found two students going at it on the floor   

"This will make a good story" he thought before   

The Sexual Harassment Office sent letters galore

[Chorus]

And when he was down, and his thoughts were thick   

His gloom was interrupted by Honda Civic   

The car slammed into him and was gone in a lick   

At least six months of rehab went by quick

[Chorus]

But the most annoying were Internet trolls   

Threats of bodily harm will take their toll   

They sent letters to his boss, and to every soul   

They could find in the whole county's Email roll

[Chorus]

After all those troubles, he still wasn't drowned   

Well, it was absurd, but this might be the crown Overpayment of library fines will bring him down   

He's no longer a student, just a proper noun

[Chorus]

[many more verses, of course, to be added along with events]

He told us all this when he started a blog   

And how fate or the Devil made him jump like a frog   

The hiring committee looked on agog [pessimistic last line] If we hire him -- then our luck will fog [vaguely "optimistic" alternate last line]   

If we hire him -- then he'll work like a dog

[chorus]

Rich Puchalsky,

It appears as if TypePad is firmly convinced my post is spam so it probably isn't worth posting in the first place!  ;-)

Anyways, we can agree to disagree.  I believe President Bush and Senator Kerry made the same types of decisions in their service to their country.  To quote the Boston Globe article from above:

"I didn't really want to get involved in the war," Kerry said in a little-noticed contribution to a book of Vietnam reminiscences published in 1986. "When I signed up for the swift boats, they had very little to do with the war. They were engaged in coastal patrolling and that's what I thought I was going to be doing."

I'm not going to criticize either Senator Kerry or President Bush for their actions.  It is apparent to me that both loved and still love their country.  Neither loved the conflict in Vietnam.
