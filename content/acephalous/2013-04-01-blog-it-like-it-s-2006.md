Adam Kotsko writes [like ain't nobody's in a business](http://itself.wordpress.com/2013/03/27/like-a-business/):

Yet it occurs to me: is _anything_ inherently a 
business?  We  normally think of a bakery as a business, for example, 
but isn’t it  actually a place where people bake things?  One can 
imagine a bakery  operating under many different economic systems.  The 
examples multiply.   A clothing retailer is a place where people come to
 get their clothes.   A convenience store exists to provide people with 
easy access to  frequently used items.  A car factory exists to make 
cars.  Even a bank  exists primarily to intermediate between people’s 
different financial  priorities (e.g., saving vs. spending), rather than
 to make money as  such.  All of those things are typically “run like a 
business” in  Western countries, but that doesn’t mean that they 
directly “are”  businesses.

Only one type of pursuit is inherently a business: hedge funds.  
Hedge  funds avowedly exist for no other purpose than to turn money into
 more  money.  They are indifferent to the means by which that is 
accomplished —  they will buy and sell anything, from an oil drum to a 
government bond  to a complex bet to pay out if a certain asset reaches a
 certain price.   For all the advanced math and physics deployed, the 
basic logic is  simple. Buy low, sell high — minimize your costs while 
maximizing your  revenue.  That’s what it means to run something “like a
 business.”

John Holbo [appreciates the overkill](http://crookedtimber.org/2013/03/28/another-pro-same-sex-marriage-argument/):

Defenders of ‘traditional marriage’ insist 1) that their position is, well … _traditional_; wisdom of the Judeo-Christian tradition, the history of Western Civilization, etc. etc.; 2) they are _not_
 bigots. They are tolerant of homosexuality, and the rights of  
homosexuals, etc. etc. Maybe they watch the occasional episode of “Will 
 and Grace”, in syndication (even if they didn’t watch it back when it  
started.) They are careful to distance themselves from those Westboro  
Baptist Church lunatics, for example.

It’s gotten to the point where one of the main, mainstream arguments 
 against same-sex marriage is that legalizing it would amount to  
implying that those opposing it are bigots. Since they are _not_ 
just bigots (see above), anything that would make them seem like bigots 
 must be wrong. Ergo, approving same-sex marriage would be a mistake.  
Certainly striking down opposition to it as ‘lacking a rational basis’  
would be a gross moral insult to non-bigoted opponents of same-same  
marriage.

This ‘anything that implies we are bigots must be wrong’ argument  
has problems. But that’s old news. Here’s the new argument. Grant, for  
argument’s sake, that contemporary arguments against same-sex marriage  
have been scrubbed free of bigotry. Doesn’t it follow that these  
arguments must _not_ be traditional but, somehow, quite new?

Some days I'm reminded of why I started blogging by the very people who encouraged me to do so. This is one of those days.
