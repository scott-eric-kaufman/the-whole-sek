Because she just got _burned_ in a totally effective manner by an actor! From a television show!

This @[amandamarcotte](https://twitter.com/amandamarcotte) claims to like quality television? Well here's one show she can no longer watch: JUSTIFIED.

The problem with this logic extends beyond the fact that conservatives [devote Russian steppes of bandwidth](http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood)
 to discrediting the idea that actors ought to participate in the public
 sphere. They start highly effective Twitter-campaigns to boycott actors
 and employers who make overtly political statements because they 
believe, deep in their ideological core, that people involved in the 
production of televisual entertainment have nothing to add to the 
national conversation_._ We're talking deep personal convictions 
here. They'd never enthusiastically embrace the statement of a character
 actor just because _who am I kidding of course they would_. They
 don't hate Hollywood -- they hate that the majority of it thinks their 
values are antediluvian. And when someone from Hollywood agrees with 
them?

[_They just can't handle it_](http://twitchy.com/2013/04/14/actor-nick-searcy-slams-pro-aborts-how-can-they-feign-outrage-at-gosnell-was-he-too-messy/).

Every conservative celebrity-of-the-month becomes the 
John-Paul-George-and-Ringo of Twitter for awhile. ([Adam Baldwin](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000284/)'s either
 sitting alone crying on the abandoned set of _Chuck_ or 
mercilessly pounding his Twitter trying to make Twitchy love him again.)
 But the thing about Twitter-campaigns and its meth-dependent scribe is 
that it all amounts to chatter amongst like-minded folks. Conservatives 
on Twitter form tiny circles of self-congratulation whose sole purpose 
is being sky-hooked into illusory importance by a service, Twitchy, that
 only exists to reinforce that delusion. No fiendish liberal could come 
up with a plan that mollifies conservative egos with the subtlety of 
Twitchy. Once they scale Malkin's xerostomic mount they feel like 
they've made it -- who cares if their throats are too parched to say 
anything else? It's not like they said much of value before.

Take [Nick Searcy](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0780678/)'s declaration above. He will never be more beloved by bigots than he is right now. _This is the summit for him_.
 All that was required of him to reach it was a profoundly impotent 
public statement. No longer will Amanda be able to turn on her 
television on Tuesday nights and watch _[Justified](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1489428/)_ because ... because ... because _Nick Searcy said so_. You'd _think_ someone
 who's portrayed as many officers of the law as Searcy has would 
understand the concept of enforceability, but apparently he's more 
concerned with being Conservative Internet Hero _Du Jour_ than actually saying something that might make sense. But at least he attacked Amanda in a way that might hurt her feelings!

Because I'm sure his empty threat to take away toys he doesn't own via means he can't control must really sting.
