Someone asked if I’d published the final post in my wrap-up of the 
mid-season finale and I mentioned that I had—on Saturday evening when 90
 percent of our readers aren’t reading. So here’s a convenient wrap-up 
of my posts on the subject:

*   Part I: [In which we learn the value of staring](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/breaking-bad-gliding-over-all-said-the-fly-to-the-money-pile).
*   Part II: [In which we learn about invisible lines and the value of staring at paintings](http://http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/breaking-bad-gliding-over-all-the-invisible-lines-and-immaterial-connections).
*   Part III: [In which we learn about the color blue and that sometimes looking is important too](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/breaking-bad-gliding-over-all-until-youre-not).

I also wrote a post about [Walter White and white supremacism](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/walter-white-is-no-white-savior)
 but it’s only tangentially related to “Gliding Over All.” So there it 
is: three posts about a single episode that don’t even begin to do it 
justice. There may be one more on the horizon, but for now the bulk of 
my visual rhetoric-related work will consist of readings of the first 
season of _Game of Thrones_ [for my Fall course](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/08/new-syllabus-game-of-thrones-bold-plan-or-blasphemy). I should have the first (of many) posts up tomorrow.
