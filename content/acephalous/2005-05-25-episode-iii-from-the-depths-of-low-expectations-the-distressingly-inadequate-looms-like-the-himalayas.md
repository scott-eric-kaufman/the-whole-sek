## Episode III: From the Depths of Low Expectations, The Distressingly Inadequate Looms Like The Himalayas

We pick up tonight's pathetic raving _in media res_.  A. Cephalous, having returned from watching his childhood enthusiasms transmogrified into narrative excrement before his wizened eyes, paced the apartment for hours, screeling Harrison Ford's praises to no avail.  The memories of the original trilogy wafted from his mind like smoke from an extinguished fire as the shit-stirring "achievements" of the latest prequel persisted, nay, thrived salamandrine-like in the furnaces into which he had cast them.  Three hours later, as his demented rage momentarily ebbed, the following words were heard:

"Compared to the entire cast of _Episodes I_, _II_ and _III_, Mark Hamill's up there with DeNiro, Pacino, etc.  The only moment in any of the prequels in which an actor actually acted was when Obi-wan leaves Anakin to die in front a river of pathetically rendered lava.  In other words, the only time any of the prequels worked on a basic narrative level--i.e. swashbuckling entertainment--is when they were entirely parasitic on the relationships established in _Episodes IV_, _V_, and _VI_.  Otherwise, lots of needlessly CGI characters lived meaningless lives and died meaningless deaths for six to seven hours until, finally, Lucas found some emotional resonance by connecting the mind-numbingly boring politics of the prequels to the human stories at the heart of the original trilogy.  _Episode III_ was far, far worse than _Return of the Jedi_.  Sure, sure Lucas couldn't surprise anyone with what would happen in the prequels...but he knew that from the get-go, and that fact should've compelled him to wrench up the elements of Greek tragedy at the heart of the original trilogy.  He did the opposite:

"'Well, because everyone knows he's going to become Vader, I'll focus on all sorts of unimportant shit instead of the relationships that'll make that eventual transformation emotionally engaging.'

"Granted, part of the reason he failed is because, as a director, he has abso-fucking-lutely no clue how to direct actors.  And he makes this problem worse by forcing them to interact in a prop-less environment, in which none of the physical cues that would ground them in their roles are present.  Compare it to _LOTR_, in which massive sets were built, and in which the actors felt comfortable on them, interacted with them, and based their physical responses to spoken emotional cues on the environment around them.  All three prequels had that same effect as the episode of _Buffy_ in which Giles, newly returned from England, is suspected of being the First because he creeps everyone he fails to interact with his environment or the people in it.  And Anthony Head did that on the set.  Everyone in the prequels looked lost on screen, unable to touch anything or, when they did, so conscious that they were touching something for a change that they looked they were trying to grab a matte-painted torch from the wall...only to find, to their amazement and utter confusion, that they could.  When Samuel L. Jackson asks the Emperor why he tried to fuck Yoda like a bitch, the only vaguely substantial object in the scene is the broken window pain on which the Emperor, whinging like a bitch in another display of Lucas' craptastic directorial skills, is lying down.  You can justify why you, personally, liked those movies better than any of the original trilogy, but from any perspective other than your own limited one, they were inferior films...with superior special effects."

Even the special effects looked worse, in my opinion, because of the CGI.  Those original puppets and mechanical gizmos were amazing.  They were expensive, which meant that they had to be used frugally, which meant that you had maybe just three or four robots or space ships on the screen at any given time, used to maximum effect, rather than 1,000 pointless doodads puttering about and making stupid squeaking sounds in every scene.  Even puppet Yoda looked kind of cool - way cooler than CGI Kung-Fu flying super Yoda.
