## German Fascism: Because Germans were Fascist when They were Nazis, but not Liberal when They were Fascists

(_Last post on this insanity, I promise._)

For [some reason](http://liberalfascism.nationalreview.com/), I keep hearing people claim that socialism, not fascism, is responsible for the beast of Nazi Germany.  ("Did they not call themselves 'National _Socialists_'?")  They insist the Nazis were only dubbed fascists _after_ WWII so that liberals might distance their beloved socialist convictions from the horrors of the Holocaust.  

I'm not above (below?) accusing post-WWII liberals of fudging the historical record in order to seem more saintly.  ([Basis of the dissertation](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/08/stick_it_to_the.html), you know?)  But this new refrain is all about the present.  The Nazis _were_ considered fascists back in the day, as is evident if you read things written back in the day.  From _The New York Times_, 24 July 1923:

> This element—former junior officers in the great war and their young brothers—today forms the backbone of German Fascism, as it did in Italy. In Germany especially they have nothing to lose—except their lives, which war experience and subsequent economic pressure taught them to value lightly—but much to gain by any upset.  The Russian fear that if an outbreak occurs, even were it under the red flag of Communism, the real control of the movement would pass to those young soldiers of German nationalism.

Given what we know about the Nazi Party and who ran it, it seems to me the Russians were right. More from "German Leaders Divided on Nazis: Middle Party Leaders Favor Forcing Fascists into Cabinent as Means of Curbing Them," _The New York Times_, 28 December 1930:

> Whether German Fascism will be actively represented in the government during the coming year now depends largely on the course of Parliamentary developments after the Reichstag resumes its sessions on Feb. 2 and such an eventuality as a new election.

> Adolf Hitler is known to be definitely opposed to having his party enter the government so long as it is only second in rank.

On our side of the pond, we find items like "15,000 Reds Cheer Attacks on Hitler," _The New York Times_, 6 April 1933:

> All of these were charged with aiding and abetting German Fascism. The audience was told, and it cheered the sentiment, that the Hitler regime and its persecutions of Jews and political opponents would end only with the victory of communism in Germany.

In 1933, the World Committee for the Victims of German Fascism published _The Brown Book of Hitler Terror_ ... so it seems to me that plenty of people considered the Nazi regime to be fascist at the time.  It was no _ex post facto_ slur the way "Social Darwinist" was.

Goldberg is mapping all politics on a see-saw with state consolidation at one end and individual liberty at the other.  No spectrum, just fat-assed kids going up and down.  He then identifies freedom in the marketplace with individual liberty.  

Through this logic, a minimum wage law is a move against "individual liberty" (read: unfettered markets).  And so socialism, New Dealism, communism, and Nazism all weigh down the state-consolidation end of the see-saw, while American conservatism rises into the air.  Whee.

What Goldberg cannot seem to imagine is that a popularly elected government might be put in power to use its power to ensure true individual liberty and rights that are abused in a free market.  Old people might get to stop working.  Poor people might get some help.  Unemployed people might have a safety net.  Darker colored people might be freed from slavery or ensured the right to vote without intimidation.  People with vah-jay-jays might be paid the same as people with shlongs.  All of which policies protect individuals.

(Goldberg's other problem is that he cannot decide if his argument is about historical contingency or political philosophy.  Some lefties might have looked up to Hitler, but that doesn't mean that they weren't contradicting their political beliefs in doing so.  Environmentalism might have been a part of some Nazis worldview, but that doesn't mean  as a set of beliefs and practices it must be forever tainted by its historical roots.  I think this is called the genetic fallacy.)

Is there any way to address this without commenting on the waste of space-time that is Goldberg's book?  Perhaps.  Goldberg's book is part of the right-wing attempt to rehabilitate fascism.  Of course, as in the famous quote, when they rehabilitate it in America they'll call it anti-fascism.  The Republicans want torture, ultra-patriotism, endless war, anti-left-agitation, takeover by an unrestrained executive, racist nativism, etc., and this is just one little preemptive step to try to ensure that people can't use the accepted name for this political syndrome.

So far, so obvious.  But what would a serious (or, at least, more-serious) unexpected left intellectual American connection with fascism look like?  I've been wondering about that ever since the to my mind completely unexplained left interest in Schmitt.  I read a little bit of Schmitt and see a completely boring fascist, not just boring, but simplistically boring -- the friend/enemy distinction as basis for state politics is one of those stupid ideas that a fascist would believe, and the kind of thing that helps to indicate why fascist politics always failed.

If you want a more serious provocation than Goldberg's drivel, try Chabert, [here](http://lecolonelchabert.blogspot.com/2007/12/toilet-paper-or-writing-in-shit.html#2313988465792505702).  I don't agree with all of it, but it's at least interesting.  There's something about the "liberal hawk" attraction to narratives of the clash of civilizations that it throws an interesting light on.

If you and Neiwert are so fucking smart, why aren't you on TV? Haven't The American People's viewing choices  revealed that they just think that you and David are all wrong? Do you two think that you are better than The American People?

Righteous Husband, you have the distinction of being the first commenter here who's ever put a question mark on every sentence _except_ the one that's actually a question.  Good Job!

John, as soon as I get that Ph.D., I'll have documented proof that I'm _much_ better than The American People.  With it in hand, my campaign to undermine American Morality and Truth and Justice will begin in full.

Rich, this is a fine sentence, worthy of repetition:

The Republicans want torture, ultra-patriotism, endless war, anti-left-agitation, takeover by an unrestrained executive, racist nativism, etc., and this is just one little preemptive step to try to ensure that people can't use the accepted name for this political syndrome.

I may just copy and paste it the next time someone tries to convince me who the _real_ fascists are.  As for Chabert's post, well, _TOO LONG_.  I trust it has a payoff.  The more interesting thing on that thread is the comment below [this one](http://lecolonelchabert.blogspot.com/2007/12/toilet-paper-or-writing-in-shit.html#1137312598095541678).  (You'll see why I linked to the one above it.)  Sample:

I perceive a level of "magic" surrounding Osama Mobarack, a red flag and a clue.
The magic surrounding Osama is not going to be used to promote bi-racial, for this will represent the gods accepting culpability . His mere presence on this national stage is all that is necessary to justify telling uppity-negros to enter into bi-racial unions, ensuring people fall on their own swords.

The gods offer a clue through his name.

Indeed they do!  

Luther, I love the image, not merely because it demonstrates more vividly than I could the origins of Goldberg's nuance.  As for the genetic fallacy, notice how it only runs one way (in the negative, at least, as all positive Republican valences are played, _e.g._ "Lincoln was a Republican")?  The _good_ the Progressives did is credited to classical liberalism -- _i.e._ contemporary Republicans -- while the _bad_ settles on contemporary liberals.  But there's no _bad_ coming from historical Republicans, even back when they were Democrats, because, well, history only matters when it's your opponents.

The Chabert comments also include:

_Beer drinking goat castrated by jealous neighbor! Clay Henry III, beer drinking goat and mayor of the west Texas border town of Lajitas, was attacked by local Jim Bob Hargrove and castrated. Hargrove committed the heinous deed after seeing the goat drinking beer on a Sunday, when the area's blue laws prevent the sale of alcohol to humans. Tourists had apparently been feeding Clay Henry his usual staple of Lone Star longnecks, and Hargrove threatened to castrate the goat, according to eyewitnesses. The mayor was found lying next to his testicles on Monday, Aug. 5. Ranchers sutured his wounds, and Clay was up slugging down cold ones soon after. Hargrove faces charges of animal cruelty._

_Just imagine the poetic justice the gods employed here:::Some indecent Texas redneck, proud that all he wants to do is sit around and drink beer, reincarnated as Clay Sr._

A first rate review from _The American Conservative_ :

[Goldberg's Trivial Pursuit](http://www.amconmag.com/2008/2008\_01\_28/review.html)

A thousand times no about that "first rate review from _The American conservative_".  

This points out the particular problem with reviewing such a horrendously bad book.  Anyone, of any political position, can write a review slamming it, and people will look at that review and think something like "wow, even someone of X political tendency doesn't like Goldberg's book.  Since I normally don't agree with who hold to X at all, this must be a particular thoughtful example of X thought."  But no.  It takes no particular brilliance to see what's wrong with Goldberg's book.  Anyone can do it.  Everyone will do it.

It's like condemning the Bush administration.  Sure, you can find something from any and every political viewpoint condemning the Bush administration as of 2007, once it became so blindingly obvious how bad it was.  But so what?  By then it was blindingly obvious as opposed to merely obvious.

The American Conservative review in question in fact continues the very tropes that Goldberg tries to introduce.  For instance, this quote:

"Other than scandalizing one’s enemies, little is accomplished by applying the categories “Right” and “Left” to Hitlerism."

Nope.  Fascism is right-wing and always has been.  If you can't say that fascism is right-wing, then you're saying that the categories "Right" and "Left" have no meaning.  But according to history, they do.  In particular, fascism and current American right-wing ideas are related as described by, say, David Niewert, and there is a possible developmental path from one to the other.

The American Conservative review tries to downplay the same connections between conservatism and fascism that Goldberg does.  The fact that the review is by a conservative and slams some of Goldberg's obvious stupidities does not make it good.

Rich: what's the story w/ Colonel Chabert? Could you do me the favor of summarizing his/her/its position w/in the intellectual blogsphere? From what I could gather from that very, very long post, CC has a beef with Daniel Miller/Antigram (now departed?) and Mark K-Punk and perhaps everyone else? What's the story? I'm asking only because context matters and also because I feel foolish coming across a blog w/ a post on Zizek that attracted 300+ comments when I've never heard of said blog.

I actually think that it's a pretty damn good review.  If the last paragraph doesn't make a whole lot of sense, well then ... there's that.  Nazism was certainly a movement of the right, but that and shared bits and pieces aren't what makes contemporary conservatism crap any more than Stalin and Mao make the contemporary left crap.  Conservatism can be crap all on its own.

Scrumptious, I didn't just say "a thousand times no" and nothing else, I gave my reasons why I thought that the review was bad.  I should also add that the reviewer refers to Schmitt as a great thinker, for which see my comments above.  

Karl, I don't know how much summing up of Chabert's story I really should do for her, but she's a leftist blogger who used to blog at Long Sunday, had a falling out with at least some other Long Sundayans over the way in which the ToS was handled, and now blogs from what I'd characterize as a Marxist position that involves disagreement with at least some thinkers -- Zizek, at least, and those influenced by him -- on what's generally thought to be on the left.  As for her having a beef with everyone, I don't know, it's not like I keep track.  But she probably does with most people in this little corner of the blogosphere; she seems to generally dislike the main people in the Valve, LS, and the Weblog, anyway.

She's abrasive, and I first read her writing when she was baiting Sean M. over at the Valve in a particularly unfair and pointless way.  But she's a reliable source for criticisms from the left that are willing to confront the annoying doublespeak by which nothing can be wrong if it comes from one of the approved set of people.  I don't often agree with her, but I can at least understand what we don't agree about.

Was she the pro-ToS faction, or the anti-ToS faction?

There was no pro-ToS faction, as far as I could tell from the various versions of the story that I've glanced at as they appeared mid-argument-about-something-else.  But someone from LS should tell that story, if they want to, not me.

Jpool, "Nazism was certainly a movement of the right, but that and shared bits and pieces aren't what makes contemporary conservatism crap" is beside the point.  If you want a sophisticated argument about how movement conservatism serves as a sort of transmission belt to move proto-fascist ideas into the mainstream, try Niewert.  What about that review is actually good?  It says that Goldberg is wrong and intellectually vacuous, well, fine, any smart fourteen-year-old could say that.  But it goes on from this unchallenged base of obvious truth to imply that fascism is not on the Right and that Schmitt was a great thinker.  That's a classic propaganda technique: a) 2 + 2 = 4, b) now that you see what a truth-teller I am, 2 +3 = 6.

Rich,

_What about that review is actually good?_  

The part that you think any smart fourteen year-old could do.  Frankly, you know smarter fourteen year-olds than I do, but the thing for me is not that it's a unique critique or that it's from a "conservative" perspective (more on those quotation marks below), but because the core of it, the critique of Goldberg is nicely reasoned and well written.  Any thinking person isn't lead from this to accept whatever other political presumptions the person making the critique is packing.  

_That's a classic propaganda technique_  

I just don't think that's what's going on here.  It's a question of intention.  Just as, while Bush and Cheney's actions make a fascist state more likely, I don't think they are _trying_ to usher one in, I don't think Bramwell's trying to use the sweet sweet candy of a critique of Goldberg to lure in unsuspecting readers.  

In support of your larger point about the dangers of decoupling Nazism from right-wing politics, however, as a Buchananite publication, the _American Conservative_ has both a more contentious relationship to movement coservatism than its name might imply, and its own reasons for wanting to defang an association with Nazis.

Posted by: JPool | [Sunday, 27 January 2008 at 06:53 PM](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/01/german-fascism.html?cid=98846352#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef00e5500ba1828834)

* * *

I understand that the _American Conservative_ has a contentious relationship with movement conservatism.  It is, however, still conservative.  As such it has its own inherent interest in denying the right-wing nature of fascism -- as you write, its own reasons to defang this connection.  That's what I'm referring to.  It's not that the _American Conservative_ is supposed to be working on a coordinated campaign with Goldberg, or something like that.  No, the review as written both criticizes Goldberg and, at the same time, attempts to cut the connections between the _American Conservative_'s own racist nativism and the right-wing racism of fascism.  It's a twofer.  Someone else reading it should not give them a pass for the second on the basis of the first, because the first is relatively valueless.

"I don't think Bramwell's trying to use the sweet sweet candy of a critique of Goldberg to lure in unsuspecting readers."

Why?  I've seen the critique linked in a number of places.  Just here, "scrumptious" recommended it highly, and you wrote that it's a pretty damn good review.  Are either of you habitual _American Conservative_ readers?  I would guess not.  So why do you say that the review was not designed to do what it has obviously done -- gotten you to read something from the magazine, and left you with a better opinion of it in some degree?

That's the weird thing about people confronted with even a minimal propaganda analysis of a piece that they liked.  They'll deny that it did what it did.  Of course many people in the center-left blogosphere are looking for critiques of Goldberg; he's a purposefully provocative buffoon.  Of course they are likely to value one from a conservative more highly, just as people currently love to link to something John Cole writes because "look, it's a conservative criticizing other conservatives".  Of course this process leaves people with a feeling that there are mythical conservatives somewhere who are all nice and rational, not like the bad, nasty movement conservatives.

That's an unfair assessment. I for one have made no such assertion.  

I thought it was a well-written, well-thought-out article that presented criticisms I hadn't seen articulated as well elsewhere.  Is it "first rate"?  Well, I admit to probably being a little hyperbolic, especially in light of some of the earlier points you made.  I'll acknowledge that "interesting" or "thought-provoking," may be a better description.

But I don't appreciate your attempts to misrepresent my views.

Misrepresent your views?  Normally I'd just shrug and blame Internet miscommunication, but really, having this come up in this context is kind of interesting.  I made exactly one assertion about your views: that you had recommended the review highly.  You linked to it and called it a first rate review.  You know, that's recommending it highly -- there's no misrepresentation there.

And from this I drew the conclusion that the review had gotten you "to read something from the magazine, and left you with a better opinion of it in some degree".  Are you in fact claiming that the review didn't get you to read something from the magazine, and didn't leave you with a better opinion of it in some degree?

You can't top Scrumptious -- in what, insanity? The two of you read an article in the *American Conservative*. You both recommended it. From this, I asserted that their writing a review of Goldberg had: a) gotten you to read an article in the *American Conservative*, b) left you with a better opinion of the magazine than you previously had.

Those are both what I'd normally call obvious facts. I guess that you could question them. Maybe you recommended the review without actually reading it, so that you didn't actually read an article in the magazine. Maybe the two of you are so coldly rational that you are able to read a review that you recommended highly and have it not affect your opinion of its source in any degree.

But rather than say anything about either of those, you prefer angry one-liners. Why so angry? Because I dared to suggest that an article in a political magazine was written to (gasp) affect your opinion of politics?

Rich, hadn't seen that bit on Shermer and Spencer yet. Much appreciated. However, I finally stole a moment to read the review of LF in _The American Conservative_, and I've got to say it's pretty damning. I'd even go so far as to call it "solid," to echo JPool above. It's one of those rare reviews that doesn't wear its ideology on its sleeve, like the [Ledeen](http://pajamasmedia.com/xpress/michaelledeen/2008/01/14/fascism_liberal_and_otherwise.php) one did. Bramwell soundly and definitively trashes the book. Now, does this make me think better of conservatives? Not really. I'll grant Bramwell points for being intellectually honest, and for being a better-than-average prose stylist:

_Repeatedly, Goldberg fails to recognize a reductio ad absurdum. He tells us that Himmler bemoaned the Christian persecution of witches, just like Wiccan feminists do today, that Hitler once described his doctrine as “reality-based,” just like today’s progressives describe theirs, and that Mussolini was quite smart “by the standards of liberal intellectuals today.” In no case does Goldberg uncover anything more ominous than a coincidence._

That's nicely put, regardless of ideology. To put this another way: with the exception of the second-to-last paragraph, I could see this review having appeared in The Nation. Now, as for this:

_Maybe the two of you are so coldly rational that you are able to read a review that you recommended highly and have it not affect your opinion of its source in any degree._

I don't buy it. Are you really saying that _The American Conservative_ deliberately slammed Goldberg in order to improve its reputation among the "vulgar liberals" the second-to-last paragraph attacks? I have my doubts that the rift between NRO and TAC is so wide the latter would court a liberal audience.

"Are you really saying that The American Conservative deliberately slammed Goldberg in order to improve its reputation among the "vulgar liberals" the second-to-last paragraph attacks?"

Among liberals specifically? Not necessarily -- but that's not what was claimed. And the question of what "deliberately" means is a bit complicated, too. I don't think that Bramwell's editor did some kind of micro-control of the review according to some formal set of propaganda talking points. I do think that The American Conservative deliberately published an article that would make The American Conservative, and therefore the conservative branch which it serves, look good. Is that really hard to believe? Why would an editor of a political magazine publish something that *wasn't* intended to make the politics of the magazine look good?

And it's important to look at what the magazine is trying to do, "trying" in the sense not that its editors have a meeting where they discuss talking points, but "trying" in terms of its rhetorical stance within contemporary politics. There's an opening out there for the honest conservative. People of every conceivable political stripe are repelled by the Bush administration and by movement conservatism. Some of them are going to want to turn to some of form of conservatism, for one reason or another. When they do, articles like this one get remembered. So sure, the magazine "wants" to write articles that seem reasonable to a broad swath of the center-left. That's where some of its new readers are going to come from.

So, OK, Bramwell gets credit from you for intellectual honesty. At the same time he disparages the attempt to call fascism right-wing. He's succeeded in doing what Goldberg couldn't do. The two concepts "intellectual honesty" and "only people who want to make trouble would call fascism right-wing" are linked.

That's how actual, successful propaganda works, through linkages that appear, on the side, once basic trust has been established by some method. The question of authorial intention is rather beside the point -- well, I'm willing to argue that the magazine editors want to make conservatism look good, because that seems so obvious -- but Bramwell does not have to have planned out the article to have this effect in order for it to have this effect. But readers who read the article should see this effect happening and shouldn't fall for it.

I don't think he slams everyone who would call fascism a right-wing ideology. In fact, he says the opposite:

> That liberalism and fascism happen to overlap is not surprising. One can find just as many similarities between fascism and movement conservatism: both assail communism, exaggerate security threats, rationalize wars of aggression, and uphold nationalism (what sentimentalists call patriotism) and its symbols (flags, founding myths, worship of national heroes). Nothing in logic compels the ideas of liberalism, fascism, or movement conservatism to cohere into a system. On the contrary, creative theorists can mix sundry political ideas as freely as the ingredients of a cocktail. Given the vast range of questions to which competing ideologies purport to provide answers, the real surprise would be if any two ideologies had nothing in common at all.

You can find socialist ideas in fascist thought, just as you can find hyper-national, hyper-masculine ideas in it too. That Bramwell diminishes the value of such connections is what I find honest: there's no necessary, genetic relation between them. At best, we're dealing with homologies, some more sound than others, but all, in the end, homologous. Works fine for literary theory, I think, much less for political, inasmuch as we're not talking about structures of representation but actual social polity.

In short, I understand what you're saying, I just don't see it at work here. I grant that Bramwell has some smart critiques of LF, that his second-to-last paragraph is odious, but none of this makes me more likely to take anything published in TAC seriously. I'm going to read it with a skeptical eye regardless, because its professed goals are so foreign to mine. In fact, I read the whole review skeptically, had my suspicions confirmed by the penultimate paragraph, then had to take a second look at it before I could temper my reaction.

Well, I've been holding that second-to-last paragraph in reserve, so to speak, because I think that my point holds without it, and because starting with that would have made my response a lot more dismissive. Here is a bit of it and the preceeding paragraph:

"Why then link liberalism in particular with fascism? Here Goldberg is surprisingly candid: because, he argues, liberals do it to conservatives all the time.

He’s right, of course. Many liberals do impute nefarious designs to conservatives. With just a modicum of restraint, Goldberg could have written a very good book. “Look,” he could have said, “‘Fascism’ has no meaning today, but, in any case, not only does conservatism owe nothing to fascism, but, historically, conservatives in America generally opposed fascism while liberals and leftists often were sympathetic.”"

All right, so Bramwell forthrightly lies. Conservatives in America generally opposed fascism while liberals and leftists were sympathetic? Not on this planet. You simply can't just chop off this material and give him credit for intellectual honesty. That devalues the whole concept of intellectual honesty -- it's defining deviancy down for the Bush era.

"That Bramwell diminishes the value of such connections is what I find honest: there's no necessary, genetic relation between them."

And I haven't mentioned this, because it's not necessary for my main point, and because I don't think Bramwell's ideas are really worth confronting, but he's all wrong about this too. Sure, there is no "necessary, genetic" relationship between elements of ideologies; ideas don't have genes. A creative theorist could indeed mix and match different political ideas to create a synthetic ideology that no one believes in. But there sure is a *historical* connection between these elements. There never has been a fascism that did not proclaim itself to be on the right and proclaim that the enemies that it was going to destroy were on the left. Those words have meanings, even though they don't have genes.

I quoted a bit of the paragraph before the second-to-last to show that Bramwell really does agree with Goldberg about a certain point in which their interests run parallel. Unsurprisingly, they are both opposed to any connection between fascism and the rest of the right wing. As I've written above, it's a not-so-hidden goal of his article. I expect that you read the thing sceptically, but clearly, many people aren't going to.

_Conservatives in America generally opposed fascism while liberals and leftists were sympathetic? Not on this planet._

See, this is where I need to be circumspect so as to not provide The Enemy with ammunition. It's actually true that American conservatives opposed fascism, but they didn't do so out of principle so much as fear. To wit: they can claim their opposition to evolution led them to reject the eugenics movement, and that's true. But those are the standards of contemporary conservatives, not the Bible-thumpers of Scopes era. All of which is only to say, liberals did embrace the technocratic ethos of the New Deal and what followed, and that's fine: the New Deal didn't involve camps, gulags, or anything of the sort.

Digging through the archives, you can find a number of prominent progressives supporting technocratic principles that, from a not-so-far distance, resemble fascism. Thing is, they don't do so with knowledge of what the future holds, and when the technocratic moment in American politics comes, they behave far differently than the fascists did. Of course, that doesn't change what they said against Hoover in the '20s.

_But there sure is a \*historical\* connection between these elements. There never has been a fascism that did not proclaim itself to be on the right and proclaim that the enemies that it was going to destroy were on the left._

See, this is where I'm going to have to disagree: there is an historical connection, it's just not meaningful (for the reasons listed above). And Mussolini did try to create an alternative populism, one that appealed to nationalist instead of Socialist/Communist Internationalist sympathies. That's there, and it's not part of what we'd call "the right" in any meaningful sense. That doesn't mean that Mussolini was a Man of The Left, obviously: he was a dictator, plain and simple, who espoused what he had to given the exigencies of the moment ... but he was a populist.

To be honest, the person to throw back at Goldberg would be either Bellamy or Bryant, both of whom were Christian socialists (after a fact, with Bryant being more of a Christian populist). Thing is, it's impossible to map their politics onto contemporary America, so Goldberg just ignores them.

Point being, I don't disagree with you about the broad strokes, nor about the necessity of battering Goldberg's specious arguments into dust. (That's why I've spent so much time thwapping him.) But if we're going to talk about the turn-of-the-last-century, we've got to admit that it's much messier than we'd like it to be.

"And Mussolini did try to create an alternative populism, one that appealed to nationalist instead of Socialist/Communist Internationalist sympathies."

All right -- but I don't see what that has to do with fascism not being a right-wing phenomenon. There are right populisms as well as left populisms. Following Neiwert's convenient rehash of fascist definitions, the boiled-down three-word one provided by Roger Griffin is [palingenetic ultranationalist populism](http://www.cursor.org/stories/fascismiii.php).

As for the technocratic ethos of the New Deal, let's not let Goldberg set the terms for what counts as fascism and what doesn't. Eugenics isn't fascism. A technocratic ethos isn't fascism. The New Deal certainly wasn't fascism; if Goldberg wants to present FDR as an American fascist, let him, but let's leave that to Goldberg.

As for the earlier material from the turn of the century, the critical point is that fascism itself didn't know what it was. Following Neiwert and Robert Paxton, I'd point out that fascism isn't really based on core texts or ideas; it's based on things that fascists tried out one after another in their pursuit of power. But a lot of early fascism was definition in antagonism to the left. So you can look for early texts that seem to agree with one or another element of what later became fascism -- but you already know the problems with that.

Paxton does find one early American proto-fascist organization: the [Ku Klux Klan](http://www.cursor.org/stories/fascismiv.php). If you're looking for turn-of-the-century American fascism, that's probably where to look. Of course, the KKK is part of the right, and the racist style merges seamlessly into the GOP Southern Strategy by which the American right still campaigns to this day.

And, parenthetically, I disagree that Mussolini was a populist dictator plain and simple. He came to power because he was handed it by Italian conservatives, just as Hitler came to power through the intervention of German conservatives, who wanted to use them against communism. Quoting Paxton [via Neiwert](http://www.cursor.org/stories/fascismiv.php):

"The Italian ones [strikes of agricultural workers] were broken by Mussolini's famous blackshirted squadristi, whose vigilantism filled the void left by the apparent inability of the liberal Italian state to enforce order. It was precisely in this direct action against farm-worker unions that second-stage fascism was born in Italy, and even launched on the path to power, to the dismay of the first Fascists, intellectual dissidents from national syndicalism."

So, I still disagree. It's been good to write in response to someone who can provide reasoned disagreement, though.
