Frank Sulloway titles [his recent review](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18041) of James Secord's [_Victorian Sensation: The Extraordinary Publication, Reception, and Secret Authorship of 'Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation_](http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&sourceid=41397204&bfpid=0226744116) with brazen inaccuracy: "He Almost Scooped Darwin."  In [his response](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/theorys\_empire\_ersatz\_theoretical\_ecumenicalism\_criticism\_qua\_criticism/#2276) to [my contribution](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/theorys\_empire\_ersatz\_theoretical\_ecumenicalism\_criticism\_qua\_criticism/) to the _Theory's Empire_ event, Sean McCann criticized the distinction I had made between Althusserian interpellation and Foucauldian discourse:
[A]t some level the
Althusserian account of the interpellation of the subject and the
Foucauldian account (in _Archaelogy_) of its disappearance are in
conflict.  But the conflict isn’t really that deep, is
it? What
the two accounts share, of course, is a sense that autonomous
personhood is wholly the illusory creation of larger, limiting
structures...In
other words, would it really be wrong for a latterday American academic
to recognize an affinity here?

As I noted in my response, Sean's right to say that with sufficient conceptual distance the Althusserian account of social determination resembles Foucault's.  Much is lost in the acquisition of that distance.  (And by much, I mean "the premises.")  Granted, McCann's operating in the tradition of the New Historicist, Benn Michaels Brigade.  The NHBMB values structural homologies, and McCann's analysis pointed to the possibility of a structural homology between Althusserian and Foucauldian thought which would've belied the historical and personal animus between these two pillars of French post-structuralist thinking.  

I spent an unhealthy amount of time thinking about the Althusser/Foucault homology and I still don't know where I stand on it.  But it's keyed me into the appearance of homologies of this ignore-the-premise-focus-on-the-conclusion sort.  Hence my problem with Sulloway's title and the argument sitting pretty beneath it.  To claim even titularly that Chambers' nearly scooped Darwin is to fundamentally misunderstand the significance of the theory of natural selection.  Such a claim entails a cult of personality based first around the anonymous author (later revealed to be Chambers) of the _Vestiges_ and later around Darwin (after the publication of the _Origin_).  If Sulloway's argument held the water I think drowns it, this cult of personality would have to be founded on the principle that the public adored anyone who said "Things Change!"  

Because "Things Change!" is the extent of the connection between the intellectual content of Chambers' _Vestiges_ and that of Darwin's _Origin_.  (Don't take my word for it.  Read the _[Vestiges](http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/chambers\_vestiges.html)_ yourself.)  The most significant difference between Chambers and Darwin concerns the mechanism of evolution:

Darwin had natural selection.  Chambers had monstrous birth.

He discusses the power of monstrous birth in [Chapter 14] (http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/vestiges/chapter14.html)of the _Vestiges_.  He first grants that the natural laws of reproduction demand that a mother of a given species give birth to a child of the same species.  But what if man in his inability to be everywhere all the time has missed the occasional monstrous birth?  Is it possible that every once in a while a goose gives birth to a mouse?  According to Chambers, who cites as proof the work of Charles Babbage, we cannot disprove that no geese has ever given birth to a mouse.  

Babbage posited that what one person infers to
be a natural law may be the result of an inadequate but effectively infinite
set of evidence.  Chambers sat his readers behind Babbage’s "calculating machine" as it ticks 1, 2, 3, 4, all the way to 100,000,000. Reasoning inductively, he argued, a rational
person would assume 100,000,0001 would follow 100,000,000. Instead, the calculating machine ticks
100,010,002. The only conclusion,
according to Babbage, is that 
the law that each number presented by the engine
is greater by unity than the preceding number, which law the observer had
deduced from an induction of a hundred million instances, was not the true law
that regulated its action, and that the occurrence of the number 100,010,002 at
the 100,000,002
nd
 term was as necessary a consequence of the
original adjustment, and might have been as fully foreknown at the
commencement, as was the regular succession of any one of the intermediate
numbers to its immediate antecedent.

Chambers analogized the inability to deduce
the engine’s actual programming by induction without a calculation of daunting
complexity with the sheer expanse of time within which the natural laws of
reproduction have worked. And if one can
no more deduce the absoluteness of these laws than the engine’s original
programming, it is possible that, at some divinely predetermined time, a goose
gave birth to a rat. Chambers noted the
occasional retrogression of one species into another, as when the heart of a
human fetus "goes no farther than the three-chambered form, so that it is the
heart of a reptile."

If the heart of a human fetus can retrogress via an "under-adequacy" into that of a reptile, why should it be beyond the bounds of reason "to imagine an access of favourable conditions to reverse the phenomenon," which is only to say
it is no great boldness to surmise that a super-adequacy in the measure of this under-adequacy (and the one thing seems as _natural_ an occurrence as the other) would suffice in a goose to give its progeny the body of a rat, and produce the ornithorynchus [duck-billed platypus], or might give the progeny of an ornithorynchus the mouth and feet of a true rodent, and thus complete at _two stages_ the passages from the aves [birds] to mammalia. (emphasis mine)

Chambers has naturalized the idea of monstrous births via his appeal to Babbage; now it is as natural for a goose to give birth to a mouse as a gander.  But that's not all.  According to this logic, birds can "evolve" into mammals in "two stages."  (Granted, there's a real logical problem with Chambers logic: if one goose gives birth to one mouse, with whom with that mouse reproduce?  A goose?  But monstrous births are rare by Chambers' own admission, so the likelihood of two geese giving birth to one male and one female mouse is extremely slim.)  The problems with Sulloway's claim should be obvious now: 

He pits Chambers' two monstrous births against the imperceptible variations of billions of organisms reproducing over billions and billions of years.  To put it another way:

2 vs. 1,000,000,000
1,000,000,000

That said, Sulloway isn't wrong to argue for the significance of Chambers' book.  It did compel a number of people to think about the laws of heredity and it was (and remained) more popular than the _Origin_ until 1901.  What Sulloway doesn't mention is that in Chambers' scheme these monstrous births are the product of divine fiat, a fact which may account for its popularity.  Furthermore, Sulloway never mentions the person responsible for priming the well Chambers would later pump so successfully: Erasmus Darwin.

Such is the danger of acquiring any level of abstraction in which all but the grossest of distinctions are leveled.  I don't think Sean's proposition abstracts itself into imprecision in the same manner.  Still, I do believe this danger lurks behind the quick construction of any structural homology.  

Thus concludes today's lesson.  If you're still reading, congratulations!  You may be a future reader of my dissertation!

This is really fascinating, Mr Non-Capo.  I've not read the Sulloway book, but of course you're right to flag up that Darwin's contribution was the mechanism of natural selection, rather than the root idea that organisms change from generation to generation -- _that_ idea is far older than Chambers, older even than the Chevalier de Lamarck.  That's common sense; any farmer who selectively breeds, as homo sapiens has been doing since farming was invented, knows that organisms change over generations.  The real question is how; and the really amazing thing is that Darwin was able to identify how without possessing an understanding of genetics.

But isn't the point about Chambers' contribution more that he established the deep-time background without which natural selection wouldn't have had time to operate?  Darwin couldn't have written _The Origin of Species_ if he'd assumed the world was made in 4004 BC atfer all.

Your thesis sounds really fascinating, and I for one am looking forward to reading it, should I ever get the chance.  Does Chambers use the phrase 'monstrous' to describe new births, by the way? (excuse my ignorance)  That's a word with an interesting pedigree.

Oh, and Althusser and Foucault are on about rather different things, I'd say.

Adam, Sulloway wrote the article, Secord the book; that might not've been clear, esp. since the essay in question can only be read by subscribers.  (If only you knew one, and could send him an email, the article could be yours!)  

I think you point to how Darwin could discover the mechanism without an understanding of genetics: he knew about selective breeding.  And he counted on everyone else knowing the same; thus, the _Origin_ opens with a discussion of the accepted truth of selective breeding, then moves to the discussion of the implications of the fact that organisms change over generations.  It's a brilliant rhetorical stroke.

I think the more customary source for the theory of "deep time"--a phrase, oddly enough, not coined by an evolutionary biologist but a journalist, John McPhee, in _Annals of the Former World_--is Lyell's _The Principles of Geology_.  Darwin's early contributions to the geological sciences all extend from Lyell's uniformitarianism.  (David Dobb's unfortunately titled but incredibly well-written and informative [_Reef Madness_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375421610/sixapart-20) is an excellent intro. to this discussion.)  As for reading my dissertation, the more the merrier!  (Actually, I slipped a paragraph from it--the one on Babbage--into the middle there, so you've actually already started.)

Aceph, I don't think my remark depended on structural homology necessarily (and I don't think it's quite fair to attribute a methodology to me on the assumption that I'm operating in a new historicist vein).  I'm quite willing to accept your argument that Althusser and Foucault were quite opposed to each other, and more than willing to recognize that this antagonism, in the context of postwar French intellectual life, had political significance--especially re the CP.  And I wouldn't even deny that a significant difference exists that's evident in their understandings of subject formation and appropriate politics among other things.  

What I did mean to say is that, as you note, some arguments up close seem significant that at a distance look like the narcissism of small differences.  For all their differences, F and A probably had more in common with each other than either did with, say, Habermas--perhaps a reflection of the fact that, despite their different attitudes, each shared a fascination with the way structuralism appeared to promise the end to the human subject.  In that context, I think it's no surprise that American intellectuals (who by and large have no feeling about the CP at all) could care less about the differences that mattered to F and A.

Sean, I didn't mean that as an attack on your position or person.  Your point got me thinking, and then thinking some more, and then a little more.  And as I'm sure you know, I didn't mean the categorization of your work as new historicist as an insult: it describes my own as well, and that's in large part the reason I think about structural homologies for lengths of time most would consider unhealthy.  All of which is only to say that if I did have an assumption about your methods, it's only because I really respect _Gumshoe America_ and consider what I took to be its foundational homology to be strikingly brilliant.  The same thing applies to _New Deal Modernism_, and is the reason I contracted to work with Szalay.  

In other words, my perpetual glibness--glibidity?--notwithstanding, I don't want you to think my calling you a new historicist was anything other than the compliment I intended it to be.  You've me thinking about what constitutes a valid vs. an invalid dismissal of the issues important to people, and that's a healthy conversation to be having with yourself when knee-deep in a dissertation.  What I fear--daily without end--is that I'll be attracted to an homology that illegitimately whitewashes significant differences between positions.  Hence the airing of these anxieties.

"You've me thinking"?  I won't edit it.  That's a perfectly legitimate use of a contraction.
