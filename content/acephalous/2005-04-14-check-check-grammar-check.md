From [Sandeep Krishnamurthy](http://faculty.washington.edu/sandeep/check/), a paragraph Microsoft Word's grammar check thinks wonderful:

**Marketing Bad

**Marketing are bad for brand big and small. You Know What I am Saying? It is no wondering that advertisings are bad
for company in America Chicago and Germany. Updating of brand image is bad for processes
in one company and many companies. 

McDonalds is good brand. McDonald’s is good brand. McDonald’s are good brand. McDonalds’ are good brand. McDonald’s and Coca Cola are good brand. McDonald’s and Coca Cola is good brand. MCDONALD’S AND COCA COLA IS GOOD BRAND. 

Finance good for marketing. Show me money!

4P’s are marketing mix. Four P’s is marketing mix. 4Ps is
marketing mix. Manager use marketing
mixes for good marketing. You Know What
I Mean? Internets do good job in company
name Amazon. Internets help marketing
big company like Boeing. Internets make
good brand best like Coca Cola. 

Gates do good marketing job in Microsoft. Gates do good marketing jobs out
Microsoft. Gates build the big brand in
Microsoft. The Gates is leader of big
company in Washington. 

Warren buffet do awesome job in marketing. Buffets eat buffets in city and town in country.

The serious point?  The grammar checker prevents students from improving their writing skills because it convinces them that sentences like "Gates do good marketing job in Microsoft" are kosher.

Best.  Comment.  Ever.  David, the bar has been raised.  Are you up to the task?  Should I cue the training montage?  How do you feel about Russian winters?

Shit, I only just came across this comment now, and man, I /do/ take this as a challenge... although specifically, I take it as an /insurmountable/ challenge. How the hell am I supposed to top "What you looking at, mister, never seen toned body at gym with no head? Give me gym pass or I sue you."? Oh man. That's just awesome... but cue the montage, Scott. 

Hold the fucking eggs, though.
