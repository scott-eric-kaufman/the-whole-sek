I’ve already [kicked a downed Goldberg while having a laugh and taking a piss on him today](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/05/i-feel-like-a-bad-person-3), so you know that I wouldn’t target him again _unless he wrote something so exquisite his nuts left my knees no choice_.

Which is exactly what happened.

According to Jonah in the article [the Other Scott linked](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/05/niall-ferguson-making-spontaneous-homophobic-remarks-about-keynes-since-1999),
 Niall Ferguson should be forgiven because he “was trafficking in an old
 theory that was perfectly within the bounds of intellectual discourse 
not very long ago.” Not since “a very serious, thoughtful argument that 
has never been made in such detail or with such care” has Jonah provided
 us with a sentence of such valuable vapidity.

Consider its lack of specificity: the “old theory” is “old,” but 
there’s no indication of how old it is; not that its age matters, 
mind you, because this “old theory” wasn’t merely acceptable back then, 
it was “perfectly within the bounds” of polite society; moreover, “not 
very long ago” this “old theory” wasn’t merely “perfectly within the 
bounds” of decorum, it belonged to the “intellectual discourse,” meaning
 that the right kind of people discussed this “old theory” all the time,
 whenever that happened to be.

Thanks to Jonah’s brilliant formulation, conservatives can now blame 
recent historical traffic — of an unspecified age and purview — for 
every vile thought that leaks through their lips. It’s not _their_ fault that we’re unfamiliar with social etiquette from whenever it was.
