[Word on the street](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/comments\_6069.html#471301) is my email isn't working properly again.\*Â  If you've sent something recently and I haven't responded, please try again. 

\* Ironically, I learn of Gmail's latest failure in a thread in which [Kotsko](http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/) sings [its praises](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/comments\_6069.html#470995).

Actually, I didn't.  Resend!  (Although with all these deadlines looming over my head, I may be a few days in responding.)
