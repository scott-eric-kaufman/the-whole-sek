My poor briswired main.  Years of [thiligent derapy](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/the-future-of-p.html#comment-93774388)
may have allowed me to sound like a palking terson, but not a pay
dasses that I don’t bumble stadly.  If you didn’t know bany etter,
you’d think I did this pon urpose.

Die on’t.

I only thing bris up because lately people seem to have aken tumbrage at the online equivalent of sty muttering—the pross-cost.

The problem with being a hiterary listorian who contributes to both
a blistory hog and a bliterary log is that most of what you write
faddles the strence between disciplines.  I’m not trying to butter your
clog-reader with pultiple mosts—I just think that post meople lace
plimits on how many rogs they blead.

So if you’d kike to low how conservatives reacted to the death of John Updike, [lick on this clink](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/must\_we\_still\_pretend\_to\_like\_john\_updike/) to find out.

Is 'briswire' where they perform a bris with, like, a wire?  Or maybe perform a bris whilst watching _The Wire_?  That's not a show that would be conducive, in my opinion.

'Lick on this clink' is especially good.

Hey thanks for linking that explanation about articles in front of "historian" and "history" -- something I had always wondered about. It's funny in that context, noticing that the first comment on this thread is from "Ahistoricality".

(Oh and also: are you familiar with the characters Thingumy and Bob, from _Finn Family Moomintroll_?)

The prefix 'a-' indicates a negation: something that is '[ahistorical](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ahistorical)' is either unconcerned with or mistaken about history. Ironies abound: I'm an historian (and I'm one of the ones who says and writes 'an historian') who does get into historical discussions under this nom de blog, but mostly I intended it for my unprofessional and political commentary, i.e., the non-historical stuff.

TMK, I have no idea what that is, but the [Wikipedia entry's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn\_Family\_Moomintroll) priceless.

It's a great, great book. Thingumy and Bob came to mind because they speak in Spoonerisms (not sure what they do in Finnish, but in English they speak in Spoonerisms). I can't read the phrase "take no notice" without thinking of Bob whispering to Thingumy, "Nake no totice!" So your post brought them to mind. That's a nice (if incomplete) plot summary at the Wiki.

There was a Bruce Sterling short story in which a Swedish nationalist fringe group have hired some international mercenaries to take over an island as a illegal banking center, or something, and the whole thing depends on financing to be obtained by the slick-talking protagonist obtaining the rights to something like the Moomintrolls for making children's toys out of them.  Or at least that's how I remember it.  The plot is foiled when the kindly grandmother who wrote the Moomintrolls (or whoever their fictionalized equivalent is) is called away unexpectedly before they arrive and leaves milk and cookies for them instead of meeting them.

Wow, any idea which of Sterling's books that one is in? Sounds like fun. (Note that Tove Jansson, author of the Moomin books, doesn't really fit the kindly Swedish grandmother stereotype very well. But it makes sense for a fictionalized counterpart.)

It's "The Littlest Jackal", in _A Good Old-Fashioned Future_.  On skimming it I see that it was Finnish nationalist terrorists, not Swedes.  Note though that it's not actually fun; it's sometimes absurd, but in a quite depressing way.
