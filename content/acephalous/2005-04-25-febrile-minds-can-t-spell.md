## Febrile Minds Can't Spell

It has been brought to my attention that in my fevered state I managed remarkable feats of misspelling.  I will read through the ramblings of my febrile mind--Ever wonder what the name of the indie band I'll never form will be?  Now you don't have to--and correct its atrocious spelling.  After all, if my words are all that represent me and they do so poorly... 

P.S.  The grammar will be combed too.  My prose went Alfalfa on me, but have no fears, I have a tongue, a comb, and no sense of shame...
