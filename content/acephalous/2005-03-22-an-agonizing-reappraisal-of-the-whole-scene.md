I'm concurrently reading Hunter S. Thompson's _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_ and Henry Adams' _The Education of Henry Adams_.  I possess neither the time nor the patience to blog in earnest tonight, but if  I did certain strange facts would come to light, such as: I am tempted by a manic impulse to curb absences next quarter by altering one of the Good Doctor's classic memos.  To wit:

> Henceforth, anyone with more than two absences will be dragged down to the basement and have his scrotum torn off.....and, conversely, any offender without a scrotum will have one permanently attached to her.  I feel such measures are necessary, even vital, to the health of this classroom.  I mean to enforce it.  This is a university--not a god damn dude rach, and any student who feels he/she cannot abide by the these new regulations, had better get out NOW.  There will be no second warnings.

Need I blog more?
