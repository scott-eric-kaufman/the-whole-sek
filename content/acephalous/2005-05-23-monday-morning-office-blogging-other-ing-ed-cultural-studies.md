This intolerable situation in which I can't type on my laptop without recreating some conditions typical to California but which, to be frank, frighten me beyond the thought of them...this intolerable situation forces me to post some unsatisfying entires.  Exhibit #1: Yesterday's hurried post on Mailer, which I will get around to revising shortly.  In the meantime, satisfy your acephalitic dependence with another installment of &lt;booming voice&gt; From The Archives &lt;/booming voice&gt;.

In 1917, cultural studies meant something entirely different from the anti-disciplinarian, anti-foundational, self-contradictory and lovin' it characterized by the thought of scholars like Teresa Ebert, who say things like
Whether postmodernism is seen as what Fredric Jameson calls "the cultural logic of late capitalism" or is associated with the writings of Jean-Francois Lyotard and Jean Baudrillard, with Derridean poststructuralists or Lacanian psychoanalysis, it has intimated the end of transformative politics. 

Throw in some Foucauldian nonsense about power producing its own immantent plurality of resistances--for, as Foucault says, "where there is power, there is resistance"--and you have a template for much of the radical and liberatory work done under the aegis of Cultural Studies.  Lump together the postmodern heavyweights, claim they're all saying the same thing--when, in truth, their nonsense is highly idiosyncratic, as is required by the neologism-happy French academe--and then build a claim on some ungentle tweakings of the whole mess.

But it didn't have to come to this.  In his 1917 article "Wanted: A Bureau of Definition," Edwin M. Hopkins supports a "cultural studies" program which, instead of training people how to think like someone else, would allow them to demystify themselves:
Since at first we can build on our own experience only, and are alive only to a small part of that until the observation has been trained, we presumably always shall find it well to begin our training with studies of more practical type; but still we are likely to require a so-called cultural study to bring from our subconscious-ness the cognition of the largest and finest part of our own personal experience without regard to the further wealth that comes from sources outside ourselves.  Hence, though what we call cultural studies are under present conditions of training far more necessary in education than they may be in time to come, they always will be necessary in order to secure the broadest experience, the most complete usefulness, and therefore the fullest life, to the individual mind.  So our bureau might give its heartiest indorsement to manual training, domestic art, and every vocational study, and recommend all for the fullest credit in college or elsewhere, but at the same time require with equal emphasis that every such study must be so directed as to train the imagination, and to train it on all sides, and then insist on such further complementary training for the imagination as may be necessary or desirable. (143)

What I find most compelling about this definition, esp. in comparison to the radical and liberatory training in Marxist, feminist, post-colonial, etc. thought is that this cultural studies, however naive and hide-bound it may now appear, focuses on the necessity of _training_ students to think.  Not demystifying them of their ideological baggage, but providing them with the tools necessary for them to demystify themselves.  The response from current Cult. Studies proponents is that there's no way to be absolutely certain that teaching students to think for themselves will lead them to draw the "correct" conclusions.  To which I respond, again and again and again, that the _being a better teacher might be a good place to start_.  

The problem with teaching one of the favored Cult. Studies paradigms is that they're ideologically inflected on their face.  If a student's inclined to agree, he or she will ignore whatever premises the system ignores and draw the conclusions the system's designed to generate.  If a student's inclined to disagree, he or she is lost.  Theorists could be drilled into the latter student's head _ad nauseum_ but, because of the ideological inflection, their thought will never be taken seriously by the student.  In other words, teaching ideologically inflected theories addresses the entire congregation, devotees and backsliders alike; but the backsliders will never return to the fold and the devotees will lead the cake-walks, bake-sales and barn-raisings they would've led anyway.  Not to mention the atheists too busy being flamboyantly queer on a West Hollywood Saturday night to care all that much about queering anything come Sunday morning...

I write this in part because of a [conversation](http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the\_little\_professor/2005/05/advice\_to\_stude.html) over at the [Little Professor](http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/)'s
has me thinking about my own pedagogical imperatives; in particular, to
how they've changed since I've moved from teaching English and
Composition courses to teaching, exclusively, Literary Journalism. 
While the move suits me and I love teaching the course, _there's a way in which_ it doesn't satisfy my social conscience the way that English and Comp. courses do.  _There's a way in which_ this article from the way, way back, the before-time, ameliorates some of my qualms.  Then again, _there's a way in which_ it doesn't.\*

\*In case you haven't noticed, when speaking, writing or thinking "there's a way in which" has become my marker of unthought or half-thought thoughts.  Thoughts I'm working through or thoughts I have worked through but not to my satisfaction are called to attention by the relentless march of "there's a way in which" to my tongue and finger-tips.
