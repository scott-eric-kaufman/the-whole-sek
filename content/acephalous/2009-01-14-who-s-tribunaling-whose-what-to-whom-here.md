Yesterday, I [was reminded](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/better-to-be-forgotten-than-remember-quite-so-fondly.html) of the odious John Ziegler, for whom David Foster Wallace’s suicide [once-in-a-lifetime self-promotional opportunity](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/how\_to\_be\_an\_asshole\_by\_john\_ziegler/). “Which act offended me more?” I asked myself. Ziegler attacking Wallace’s “[Host](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200504/wallace)” the day his death was announced, or the anonymous student Horowitizing about grades in a professor’s memorial? 

Offense being an unlimited resource, I decided not to choose. The desire [never to waste brain](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/how\_to\_be\_an\_asshole\_by\_john\_ziegler/#22297) on John Ziegler again factored heavily into my decision, but then I read the [_Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/nyregion/13nyc.html?\_r=1&em) and learned that the world [conspires against me](http://www.howobamagotelected.com/). Want more proof? Click around that very-professional-from-the-look-of-it-website and [you land in my new least favorite place](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jziegler/2009/01/14/reaction-to-my-palin-interview-proves-the-point/), where you learn that

[t]he Governor’s measured, rational and accurate
attempts to correct the historical record about the basis for which a
Presidential election was decided were “reported” by the left as being
“whiny,” “catty” and “delusional.” Folks, there’s a reason why there’s
such a thing as a war crimes tribunal; some things you just have to get
to the bottom of.

Finally, a prominent-ish conservative who understands the need for a war crimes tribunal—wait, _what_?

It might be better for your outlook on life if you didn't pay so much attention to right-wingers.

Well, as one of those "right wingers" SEK should ignore, I'm afraid that I need to ask "Who is John Ziegler?" and "Why should I care about what he has to say?"

[Google it](http://www.google.com/search?q=john+ziegler&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a)  

I didn't know who Ziegler was, but this transcript of his [conversation with Nate Silver](http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/interview-with-john-ziegler-on-zogby.html) is priceless.  I do agree with Kotsko, though, as I hope that reading this interview will be the last time I have to think about Ziegler.

Ah, I see. A former KFI talk show host. Sorry, can't get KFI on the east side of the rockies, and Texas is too close to the 640 from Cuba. Even if the signal from KFI would make it here, the 640 stations from Fidel would beat it to a pulp.
