I pretty much assumed that you were Smurov, based on Smurov's choice of subject matter.  But this need neither be confirmed or denied.

I couldn't decide if it was SEK or Holbo, but I eventually leaned toward Holbo when I learned that "Smurov" is the name of a character from a Nabokov story.  But then there's the polemic against psychoanalysis, to which John usually seems to be more indifferent or annoyed rather than hostile....  I finally decided that you two were taking turns and doing partial impressions of each other.

Adam, you thought Smurov's post a polemic against psychoanalysis?  Seemed to me a statement about a particular model of discourse, one which, while successful in the short term, creates problems in the long, as it did for Herbert Spencer's thought and reputation.  It didn't attack psychoanalysis, so much as note that Zizek's scorched earth method of philosophical disputation has an historical precedent ... one he wouldn't likely appreciate following.  Smurov said nothing materially about Zizek or psychoanalysis.

"I couldn't decide if it was SEK or Holbo"

A quick Google brings: "For the record, Smurov is not John Holbo - although we admit it was a plausible inference. Smurov is some other guy."

Smurov's identity isn't very well concealed.

Feel free to redact that and this, but there is something Smurov needs to be more careful about that's probably best noted off-blog.

_Smurov's identity isn't very well concealed._

Like so many pseudonyms -- including my own -- it's functionally impenetrable for those who aren't a part of that discourse community, but relatively transparent to the people who spend a great deal of time getting to know the scholars and commenters within the group.

I read the post as (implicitly) claiming that it was more or less obvious that psychoanalysis was going to die out in the near term.

I have no idea if anything used to be here or not, but the post here about that one book followed by a post by Smurov about the same book seemed fairly suspicious.
