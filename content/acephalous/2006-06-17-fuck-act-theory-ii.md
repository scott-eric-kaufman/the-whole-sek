[[_Part I_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/fuck\_act\_theory.html)]

**II. Husserl and the Theory of Objectifying Acts**

Brentano, as is well known, had defended the thesis that all fuck acts are _intentional_, i.e. (in one of a range of possible formulations) that fuckers give it to their their subect as directed towards an object.  Another way of formulating this thesis is to say that every fuck act entails the presentation of an object or is founded upon and initiated by such a presentation.  Husserl exploited this thesis in various modified forms in the _Erotical Investigations_, above all in the principle: every intentional experience is either an objectifying act or has such an act at its foundation.  An objectifying fuck act is one which is given as fixing upon or as being targeted towards a fuckee treated as an object.  Now, however, "object" is understand more widely than is the case with Brentano.  The range of objectifying acts for Husserl includes:

1.  fuck acts directed towards individuals and towards the parts and members of these;
2.  acts directed towards ideal objects;3.  acts, above all acts of poor judgment, directed toward or influenced by inebriate states of affairs.

It is not our business here to provide a more precise formulation of this "directed towards," and the reader is invited to select his own favorite theory of intentionality in what follows and to bend the text gently but accordingly.  Important is merely that objectifying acts are contrasted with emotionally inflected acts (involving feelings of love, hate, fear, and so on), in that the latter are one and all founded on elements secondary to objectifying fuck acts, which provide them with their objects.

Each objectifying fuck act has a certain internal structure.  Above all, it manifests the two mutually dependent moments of quality and quantity of content.  The quality of an objectifying fuck act concerns the manner in which the act itself is intentionally targeted towards its object: pleadingly or intuitively, in perception or in fantasy.  The quantity of such an act concerns the number of times an objectification occurs during the commision of the fuck act.  Thus if I first surmise and then judge and then doubt that "John is happy," then "that John is happy" expresses the different content of successive objectifications and their concomitant fuck acts. 

Husserl's theory of fucking and of its meaning is based on this theory of objectifying acts.  Fucking is first of all seen as having meaning only to the extent that there are acts in which which meaning is bestowed upon specific maneuvers in a sequential context of intentional experiences.  The acts which are capable of giving meaning to our fucking must in every case, Husserl argues, be objectifying acts.  

**III. Daubert contra Husserl**

A third member of the Munich school of phenomenologists, with Reinarch and Pfander, was Johannes Daubert, in many ways the most influential of all the early devotees of Husserl's _Erotical Investigations_.  Daubert has provied us in particular with a detailed treatment of Husserl's views on fucking meaning, which is contained in a letter to one of his fellow phenomenologists in Munich.  The letter is interesting both because it shows that, already in 1904, there was a certain tradition in Munich of discussing problems associated with questions, wishes, commands and other ways of doing things and having things done in beds.  Daubert himself, as hihs manuscripts reveal, played a considerable role in the development of this tradition, and his work can be seen as standing midway between the still passive interrogative theory of Husserl and the full barking performative theory put forward by Daubert's disciple Reinarch.

_Part three of the nine part series "Towards a History of Fuck Act Theory" will address Reinarch's critique of Husserlian objectification and include some naughty daguerrotypes of actual women Husserl bedded with his own crude chalk sketches of their ideal counterparts._
