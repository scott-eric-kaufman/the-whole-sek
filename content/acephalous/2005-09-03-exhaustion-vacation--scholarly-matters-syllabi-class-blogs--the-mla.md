Just when I'm too exhausted to think about Louisiana anymore, it dawns on me that the vacation the wife and I planned months ago is suddenly upon us.  As in "Leaving for San Francisco on Sunday."  This may be a good thing considering how I can't possibly feel any more impotent than I currently do, but this leaves many things up in the air.  To speak of things unrelated to Katrina:

This means another week without my laptop, so another week without regular updates here, at the Valve, or on my dissertation.  (That's the thing I intended on finishing a chapter of _before_ I went on this vacation and _before_ the quarter started.  Contingency intervenes again.)

This means another week without finishing the posts I've already nearly finished on _The Literary Wittgenstein_ and _The Plot Against America_.  (That may be a good thing.  Give people a vacation from what they may consider tired topics at this point.)

This means another week of not finishing my syllabus for the Fall Quarter or the teaching blog I've created for the students.  It'll be a whiz-bang blog when it's finished, complete with links to publications favorable to literary journalism; reviews of works of literary journalism (such as have appeared on the Valve and other blogs); mini-interviews I have and will be conducting with some of the authors the students will be reading this quarter; and much, much more.  It'll be the teaching blog to top all teaching blogs.  _It will make class preparation more entertaining for me because I enjoy this blogging thing more than the class preparation thing._ (I love the class-teaching thing, the student-interacting thing, and the seeing-students-improve-from-paper-to-paper thing.)  But this will have to wait.

So will the decision on whether or not to attend the MLA this year.  Jonathan, Sean _et al._ have been fairly convincing (even though given the availability of departmental funding and the generally miserly life the wife and I live, money wouldn't be an issue).  If it will be no more traumatic to be there and sell myself than to simply be there, I might as well pocket that money, skip the trauma and spend the winter working.

Scott, what have your experiences been with courseblogs? I'd like to hear more about that. I've begun using them in my courses and so far so good (only two weeks worth of classes under my belt). In one class there's a blogging requirement and the students seem to be enjoying it (you know that when they start fussing with their templates to make it look different). It's still too early to tell, but so far so good. It's just so much more convenient to post things on my courseblogs than on a webpage. That's what I love the most about it. But I'm still looking for ideas about how others use courseblogs.
