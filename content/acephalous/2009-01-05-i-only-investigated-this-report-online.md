Michelle Malkin’s [vaunted list](http://michellemalkin.com/2009/01/04/who-says-conservative-bloggers-dont-do-reporting/)
of “investigative online reporting published on conservative blogs”
demonstrates, for the umpteenth time, that Michelle Malkin can’t tell
the difference between reporters and partisan political operatives. She
opens the list reportly enough—Patterico’s posts on [William Jefferson](http://patterico.com/2008/05/28/revealed-exclusive-new-details-regarding-different-allegations-of-bribery-of-us-rep-william-jefferson/), [Alex](http://patterico.com/2008/06/11/kozinskis-porn-stash-revealed/) [Kozinski](http://patterico.com/2008/06/11/the-la-timess-tipster-on-kozinskis-porn-cyrus-sanai/) and [Chuck](http://patterico.com/2008/11/23/chuck-philipss-letters-to-a-witness-merely-suggestive-or-witness-tampering/) [Philips](http://patterico.com/2008/03/27/a-tale-of-two-recanters-and-their-friend-la-times-%!e(MISSING)2%9cinvestigative%!e(MISSING)2%9d-reporter-chuck-philips-part-one-by-guest-blogger-wls/) are, in fact, works of investigative journalism—but after that you have:

1.  a [hit-piece](http://michellemalkin.com/2005/09/27/where-in-the-world-63/) on Air America
2.  a [hit-piece](http://www.minnesotademocratsexposed.com/index.php) on Al Franken
3.  an [unpublished hit-piece](http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/the-op-ed-the-new-york-times-wouldnt-run/) by Larry Grathwohl that [Confederate Yankee](http://confederateyankee.mu.nu/) posted because neither knew the _New York Times_ doesn’t print op-ed rebuttals
4.  [something or other](http://rsmccain.blogspot.com/2009/01/yglesias-right-and-wrong.html) in which someone talks about attending political rallies
5.  a hit-piece on Ayers in which one “Zombie” [did a Lexis-Nexis search](http://www.zombietime.com/zomblog/?p=64)
6.  numerous failed hit-pieces by Charles Johnson—[representative](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/30241\_At\_the\_Official\_Obama\_Site-\_How\_the\_Jewish\_Lobby\_Works)—about trolls on Obama’s community blogs
7.  a [hit-piece](http://www.bizzyblog.com/2008/03/17/tuccs-church-bulletins-from-july-2007-probably-make-whether-obama-was-present-on-july-22-irrelevant/) on Jeremiah Wright
8.  a [hit-piece](http://gregransom.com/prestopundit/2008/04/gregs-guide-to-barack-obamas-d.html) on Obama Jr. via Obama Sr.
9.  numerous hit-pieces by Stanley Kurtz—[representative](http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MTgwZTVmN2QyNzk2MmUxMzA5OTg0ODZlM2Y2OGI0NDM=)—on Obama
10.  numerous hit-pieces on Obama for his “abortion extremism” in which
his public voting record and campaign statements were “reported on”
11.  some “[top notch investigative work](http://michellemalkin.com/?s=palestra)” that links to back to Malkin’s post
12.  some video hit-pieces [on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iivL4c\_3pck&feature=channel) that rebroadcast Obama’s never-before-heard and never-anywhere-seen statements about “redistributing wealth”
13.  a [Google search](http://www.google.com/search?q=ed+morrissey+adscam&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a) for Ed Morrissey at Hot Air that “brought down [Canada's] liberal government in 2005
14.  a whole slew of hit-pieces written by Malkin herself which I won’t bother to link to

My point?

Doing a Lexis-Nexis search _is not investigative reporting_.

Reprinting material from social networking sites _is not investigative reporting_.

Rebroadcasting clips that every network—including Foxnews—had in heavy rotation for weeks on end _is not investigative reporting_.

Attacking people with whom a Presidential candidate had some contact _is not investigative reporting_.

While it’s possible for partisan hacks like Malkin to do investigative reporting, little of what she presents _as_ investigative reporting _is_
investigative reporting.  The majority of her links are to undisguised
attacks by unpaid political operatives, and—say it with me now—an
undisguised attack by an unpaid political operative _is not investigative reporting_.

Nice. I'm so glad someone else reads these things....

_Doing a Lexis-Nexis search is not investigative reporting._

Well, it's better than a lot of so-called professionals do, these days. It's _research_, at any rate. It's going to get worse, too....
