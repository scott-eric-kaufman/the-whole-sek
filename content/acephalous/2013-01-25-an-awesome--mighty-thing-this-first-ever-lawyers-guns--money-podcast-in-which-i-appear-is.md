It features Yours Truly and the Farley fellow you see primping there in preview—or wearing a hat, now that I had to re-upload the video—and we're talking about _The Hobbit_. You're ... welcome?





It goes without saying that there are kinks to work out—if only because I'm in charge of the production—and that while many Internet Traditions are honored, some are violated. Case in point: the blog's beloved ampersand is a monstrosity in the font the rest of the credits need to be in. (I promise that sentence will make perfect sense once you watch it.) An "enhanced" audio file will be available shortly, though I can't vouch for the quality of said "enhancements" because we haven't figured out what they'll be yet outside of "enhanced."

But fear not! You'll learn many things in this podcast, including (but not limited to) which of you lot inspire us to invent gang signs just so we can throw some in your honor. And also many things about _The Hobbit_.  Enjoy!
