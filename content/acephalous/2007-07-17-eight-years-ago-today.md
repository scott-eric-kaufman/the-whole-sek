## Eight Years Ago Today

I got myself hitched.  Being that I'm a lucky bastard, I found me a woman smarter, more attractive, and with far superior career prospects.  (Would that I found paleography more interesting!)  So join me in celebrating my wife or commiserate with me over my inevitable spousal-hire—or wait until tomorrow, and respond to something substantial.

Happy anniversary! 

(My own is only two days--well, and two years--behind!)

Congrats!  My husband and I are hoping to remember ours this year (we mutually forgot last time around).  Have a happy anniversary.

Congratulations!

It's sort of interesting how indeterminate this date is, though, for what I'd imagine is many people.  I've been married for 11 years, but I can never remember how many years exactly offhand because the official date is only somewhere on a continuum along with the first-met-each-other date, the first-commitment date, and the moved-in-with-each-other date, which generally leave me thinking that we've been together in some more important sense for 17 years.

Plus when I look back at the license itself, to check the year, I see that the date of the license is not at all the same as the date of the ceremony (which I got us to have on my birthday as a clever ploy towards my not forgetting it) -- so we've been officially married for 9 months longer than going by the wedding date.

Congrats to the two of you! You're \*both\* pretty lucky (and presumably also deserving), methinks.

Does SHE have a head? If so, they she might very literally be your better half.

Um, I feel like I should say something more substantial than "congrats." I did a Google search, but, I'm not that steadfast. I'm not a fan of stars, bright or not, either. And seriously, "eremite" is a dumb word. Who says shit like that? 

So, I guess I'll just have to say Happy Anniversary and Congrats!

Erm... doesn't "eremite" mean "of ermine," or of hermits, or eruditic, or somthing along those lines? Wiseass! Oh, how I miss our days of paleographizing in the presence of greatness (before the dark days of examinating) and planning to revolutionize the world of both text and gloss in some form of Anglicana! All other readers and interpreters: hopefully one day I too shall be without a head (and yet have a name-- a feat that most of us can only dream of).

Since I've been away I did not read this until today.  Since you never remember the right date, I am surprized that you know it this year.  I myself thought it was July 23rd, so I never remember the correct date either.  I guess I get it mixed with the August date.  Anyway, I can assure you it only gets better with time as I am looking at the 30 something year and I no longer remember a life before marriage. Never forget the gift you have in this wonderful woman you have found and pray she never leaves!!! Also, hope she never forgets who you are and you never forget who she is because that pain is beyond hurt.
