## Look at the children!  See how they laugh at me!

In a fit of Very Poor Timing, last Thursday I assigned my students [the following](http://acephalous.typepad.com/wr39b/2009/04/for-thursday-23-april-2009-sunday-26-april-2009.html):

By 11:59 p.m. on Sunday, you need to have torn me a new one in a comment on the second _Dark Knight_ post.  Before you do, I
highly recommend you read all your classmates' posts from Thursday,
because this is a rhetorical performance.  You don't want to be the
person who kicked me in the shins when your classmate defenestrated me,
nor should you aspire to be the person who decapitated me on my way out
the window; no, you want to be the person kicked me in the shins and _set me on fire_ when I looked down _then_
decapitated me on my way out the window.  In other words, I want you to
be tactically brutal.  The best comments will be read aloud in class
and their authors will receive bonus points.   

The results can be found [here](http://acephalous.typepad.com/wr39b/2009/04/the-dark-knight-scene-analysis-part-ii-the-fundraiser.html).  Given that my students produced some damn clever readings on Tuesday, I have no choice but to consider the experiment in insult a success.  Students do not normally feel comfortable enough to lash out at their teachers like that.  

(In the future, however, I'll avoid assigning this particular exercise on weekends I end up in the ER.  Who wants to be cut down when they barely have the strength to stand?)

So ... how did you end up in the ER?  If it was from an infected paper cut from tearing down a derogatory poster with a picture of yourself, then I really should write about something good happening to you next time.

Scott: didn't you check the syllabus before you scheduled your ER visit?

Really, it's very irresponsible to be sick or injured when your students need you. My full-bore breakdown is scheduled for late June; until then, I just have "stress."

Here's how I avoid these sorts of problems: I create a master schedule for the semester, with all of my courses displayed in parallel, so I can see where my choke-points and lighter weeks will be. Then I can get sick, or have accidents, all I want, as long as I do it in the light weeks. Sometimes I schedule a day or two into the syllabus for me to flake out: I call those "review days"....

You invited your students to attack you? You are such a masochist! (And coming from a fellow PhD-getter, that is saying something!)

And what did you do\_this\_ time to land you in the ER? I hope it wasn't like what I do and getting an injury from something like walking or standing up out of a chair.

Get well soon, you cretinous fool!

My god, what are you doing? This is like the pedagogical equivalent of The Island of Dr. Moreau: you're cross-breeding perfectly decent humanities students with trolls to produce rhetorical monsters!

_So ... how did you end up in the ER?_ 

The ER was [for my headache](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/la-noche-oscura-del-seno-frontal.html)---which, yes, sounds lame, but did I mention I have headaches all the time and that this was no ordinary headache?  (And that the clinic I went to doesn't provide pain medication on principle, because, I suppose, of all the junkies in the OC?)

_didn't you check the syllabus before you scheduled your ER visit?_

One of the kids made a similar remark: "I didn't see anything about you being sick on the class blog.  I'll need to see a note from your doctor, or I'm just not going to allow you to grade my assignment."

_You invited your students to attack you?_ 

But did you read their responses?  Pure hilarity!

_you're cross-breeding perfectly decent humanities students with trolls to produce rhetorical monsters!_

Perhaps, but the serious pedagogical value of the assignment was to get them to be self-conscious about rhetoric, thereby immunizing them against trolls and trollish tendencies.  I specify that this ain't the way it's done, then ask them to do it anyway to stress the performative aspect of all rhetoric.  But the proof, as they say, will be in the pudding.

Oh my god.  You're teaching your students to flame blogs?

...is your class offered online?
