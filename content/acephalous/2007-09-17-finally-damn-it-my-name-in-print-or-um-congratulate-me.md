## Finally, Damn It, My Name in Print; or, um, Congratulate Me?

Last night I dreamt I'd secretly published an article in [_American Literature_](http://americanliterature.dukejournals.org/).  It was unavailable online, but if you took the most recent hard-copy in hand and moved it up, down, up, down, left, right, left, right, up and opened it to page 119, my _
magnum opus
_ [_opera mictilis_](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/how\_not\_to\_open.html#comment-6086767) would appear.

In the dream, I found it difficult to convince hiring committees of its existence ... which is just as well, since judging from this year's job list, it's better I didn't hit the market anyway.  (Not that that'll stop me from attending the MLA: I'll be there schmoozing and moping, schmoozing and moping.)  But in my dream, when I would show them the article in print, they would insist that it didn't exist, as they couldn't find it online. 

My latent anxiety bodes well for the future of university publishing in the digital age.  

**Unrelatedly:** When I checked my email this morning, I learned that the article I thought ruined by the "[John Casper Affair](http://crookedtimber.org/2007/06/11/blogging-gets-results/)" will appear in print after all.  Apparently I work well under pressure ... or found my very own [Maxwell Perkins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell\_Perkins).  (I incline to the latter.)

**UPDATE:** In the dream, I published in _American Literature_.  I don't think I made it clear that in reality, I'm being published elsewhere.  I'll put a link up when it goes online.

They would've believed you if you had told them you had to move the magazine up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, then hit B and A.

Congratu...lations? I'm confused if I'm congratulating you for having the \_perfect\_ job market anxiety dream or if you \_did\_ publish something. Or if you were the one who wrote the seminar paper CR's burglar pissed on. 

Either way, congrats! Be sure to tell me how to use Mario Bros. secret combination moves to access the Tenure Challenge Round. (maybe you didn't look at the \*hidden invincible star\* version of the JIL? I thought the list looked pretty good. [heu mihi] (http://ageofperfection.blogspot.com/2007/09/trying-to-work-and-failing.html) agrees.)

In game-design (and some other programming situations) they call something hidden in the code like that an "[Easter Egg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter\_egg\_(virtual))." It would be wicked cool to have one embedded in a print journal! 

Mazel Tov on the pub!

In graduate school I learned the old saying that "the best dissertation is a finished dissertation"; after that it's "the best article is a published article"....

Articles, feh.  Only books count--the more the better.  Didn't KC Johnson's supporters teach you that?

Seriously, though, nice news for the new year.

Now is it time to republish the faux-Sports Center thing from before, and then explain that it's really not appropriate yet? ...  Or is it?  ... Or isn't it? ... Or is it? ... Or isn't it?  

Seriously, it is ... right?  

Congrats though.  Since I'm not likely to ever look at an issue of _American Literature_ in the wood pulp, what the piece about?

Congratulations!

I'll also be at the MLA, so I can provide an audience for moping, if necessary.
