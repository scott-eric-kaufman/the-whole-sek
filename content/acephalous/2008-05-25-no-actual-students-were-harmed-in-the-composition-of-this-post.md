## No Actual Students were Harmed in the Composition of this Post

The plot of this blog post is about why I have not been posting and I am writing it like this because my wife, to whom I am married, is currently grading papers.  She uses the adjective "excellent" to describe the papers to me.  It is a descriptive word.  Its description is emotional and resonates to people who have emotions.  The reason I have not been blogging, which I mentioned earlier is crucial to the plot of this blog post, is for many reasons.  

The first reason is that I have been watching my iRobot Roomba vacuum the apartment.  Although it is supposed to be a time-saving device, many experts believe that the time people waste watching an iRobot Roomba vacuum an apartment eliminates the function of its time-saving.  

The second reason I have not been blogging is because I have been exercising.  According to the government agency called the National Institute of Health in a book with the title [_Energize Yourself! Stay Physically Active_](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/other/chdblack/energiz1.htm), it is important to stay physically active because physical activity:

*   can make you feel more energetic
*   can help you lose weight and control your appetite
*   help you sleep better

Other benefits include:

*   lower your chance for diabetes
*   lower your chance for a stroke
*   lower your blood pressure

The National Institute of Health is from the government and a reliable source.  Therefore I believe and trust them because they are trustworthy.  Exercise and physical activity are a good thing and I am doing them instead of blogging.

The third and final reason that I am not blogging is because I hate Mark Twain.  Mark Twain was an American writer in the last century.  His many books, which include masterpieces like _Huck Finn_ and _Tom Sawyer_, are called masterpieces by the experts in literature who read them.  Mark Twain is also a rat-bastard who spins gleefully in his grave every time a scholar tries to figure out the racial politics of _Pudd'nhead Wilson_.  This is the third and last of the three reasons I have not been blogging.

Roombas make me miss Hitherby Dragons, because Hitherby Dragons had as one of minor characters a Roomba which had developed an End of Everything button, probably through prolonged exposure to a magical area.  One of the characters once thanked another for not pushing the End of Everything button even though, for someone of a curious disposition, it was difficult not to.  Hitherby Dragons never reached the End of Everything because its writer stopped writing it and may or may not start again.  I suspect that the writer of Hitherby Dragons was actually one personality of a person suffering from MPD who has now integrated, so the writer of Hitherby Dragons may effectively no longer exist as such.

Hitherby Dragons was excellent, much more excellent than I suspect that the papers that your wife is grading could be.  Back when I thought that literary types had some interest in "discovering" new literature, I tried to call people's attention to Hitherby Dragons, since I suspect that it is an undiscovered work that could become canonical, especially if it were ever finished.

God help me, I think your wife and I are grading the same set of papers.

I graded 65 tenth grade English finals this weekend.  They were all on "I wandered lonely as a cloud."  If I ever see that poem again, I might smash my own head in with a Roomba.

(And can we all remember the genius that was the SNL "Womba" commercial?)

The 1958 Mad Magazine parody of that poem has completely displaced my memory of the original: I'll quote it here so it may do others the same service:

I wandered lonely as a clod,   

Just picking up old rags and bottles,   

When on my weary way I plod,   

I saw a host of axolotls;   

Beside the lake, beneath the trees,   

A sight to make a man's blood freeze. 

Some had handles, some were plain;   

They came in blue, red, pink, and green.   

A few were orange in the main;   

The damndest sight I've ever seen.   

The females gave a sprightly glance;   

The male ones all wore knee-length pants. 

Now oft, when on the couch I lie,   

The doctor asks me what I see.   

They flash upon my inward eye   

And make me laugh in fiendish glee.   

I find my solace then in bottles,   

And I forget them axolotls. 

By Tom Koch, if the internet can be trusted.  (And of course it can.)  I also remember reading somewhere that this is the most widely parodied poem in the English language.

I also remember hearing that the actual first line of the original version of the poem was "I wandered lonely as a cow".  There's something to be said for revision, I suppose.

Speaking of which, feast your eyes on [this actual, official – seriously – Lake District promotional video of a man in a squirrel costume rapping "I wandered lonely as a cloud". They're trying to appeal to a younger, hipper demographic. Or being _very_ ironic.] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXbrSALG684)

Ok, so next time I might even _close_ that link tag.

Marting, that video is the best regional promotion video ever made. I especially like how it's obvious that the makers went on short trip from London to make the video, what with the East London Estuary accent.

_Pudd'nhead Wilson_ is my favorite novel by Twain, and I think you've put your finger on why. (But I like his nonfiction best.)

Naadir: It really is quite something. I mean, I can understand that you might want rapping Londoners in the Lake District, but – a rapping _squirrel_? I would  have loved to have been a fly on the wall at that advertising company meeting.

I have made this poem more relvant to suburbanites:

I wandered lonely as a cloud  

That floats on high o'er vales and pines,  

When all at once I saw a crowd,  

A host, of golden dandelions;  

Beside the lake, beneath the trees,  

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze....

For oft, when on my couch I lie  

In vacant or in pensive mood,  

They flash upon that inward eye  

Which is the bliss of solitude;  

And then my heart with pleasure whines,  

And dances with the dandelions.

_Back when I thought that literary types had some interest in "discovering" new literature, I tried to call people's attention to Hitherby Dragons, since I suspect that it is an undiscovered work that could become canonical, especially if it were ever finished._

Rich, you ought to know better.  I don't have time to read anything I haven't already read five times before, elsewise how would I plumb _more_ meaning from its frequently meager depths?

_The 1958 Mad Magazine parody of that poem has completely displaced my memory of the original._

**1958**?  Why are you reading _Mad_ magazines from **1958**?

_If I ever see that poem again, I might smash my own head in with a Roomba._

Not mine!  You leave [_SEK's offensive name for his Roomba_] alone!

Martin, that deserves its own post.  Lo and behold!  There it is!

_Pudd'nhead Wilson is my favorite novel by Twain, and I think you've put your finger on why._

Ray, you like _PW_ because it prevents me from finishing the dissertation?  That's just cruel.

"Why are you reading Mad magazines from 1958?"

I read it as an old-time best-of reprint of old Mad magazines in 1972 or thereabouts, and it's stuck with me ever since.

I cringe to think of how very often I introduce a list of reasons, then number them as I give them.  I'm hurting a little bit right now.
