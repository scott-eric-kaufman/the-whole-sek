**Monday!** Spent three hours on the tarmac in Houston waiting for the Continental mechanics to fix something!  Drove myself nuts trying to figure out what that something was!  Forgot that my sister's almost-fiancé is an airplane mechanic!  __ For Continental!  In Houston!  

**Tuesday!** [Earthquake](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsus/Quakes/ci10411545.php)!

**Wednesday!** Locked the doors so [the strange man with the rifle](http://blogs.ocweekly.com/navelgazing/breaking-news/uc-irvine-issues-alert-about-a/) couldn't shoot my eye out!

**Wednesday night!** Scott McCloud [commented](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/05/scott-mccloud-learns-to-follow-the-advice-he-would-later-dole-out.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef0115709b893a970b#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115709b893a970b) on my post about Scott McCloud!

**Late Wednesday night!** My [cat Sigmund](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/12/have-yourself-a-very-sm-chrishey-whats-that.html) had a hairball!

**One minute later Wednesday night!** That's not a hairball!  Siggy's coughed up blood!

**Twenty minutes later Thursday morning!** I hate the only late night emergency care clinic around here!  Reminds me of Rachel!  Spent seven hours I should've been asleep waiting for test results!  Found out Siggy's problem is he's swallowed a branch of evergreen needles that he can't seem to cough up!  Doctor fixed Siggy!  

**This morning at 7:15 a.m.!** Jumped in shower!  Thought water would defeat exhasution!  Was wrong!  Spent the morning teaching!  Spent all afternoon doing mandatory student conferences!  Arrived home!  Fixed drink!  Fell asleep while writing this po_—_

Yeah, how about that, Scott McCloud, author of the best textbook in narrative cognition.

Glad Siggy's OK.

Blimey!

I like 'SpenT'.  I may use it, in preference to 'Spent'.

If people spent more time around guns they would be able to distinguish a real gun from a BB gun, and stop wasting our time.

CorrecteD!  (I wasn't kidding when I said I was exhausted.)

_If people spent more time around guns they would be able to distinguish a real gun from a BB gun, and stop wasting our time._

The obverse is also true: if they stopped making paintball and water guns look so realistic, people wouldn't mistake them for real guns.  (I still remember going to a gun show once, looking at a water gun and having the gun selling it say, "The only way you can tell the difference is the heft.")

_having the gun selling it say_

Talking guns sell other guns? Still exhausted?

I have a good "oh my god is that a real gun oh god thank god it's a bb gun, why do I keep on invoking god" moment.

I spent the first half of my junior year abroad and when I got back the next semester I was living with random kids I didn't know. The second day or so living there, I am helping search for the remote control. I look under the couch and see a pistol, big, black, scary. I say nothing, just stare. Then, slowly reach out, grab it, lift it, and sigh relief loudly enough to attract my roomates attention. They promptly laugh and laugh at my fright.

We, of course, spend the rest of the year shooting each other.

I think I only previewed in instead of posted last time. So, again.

 _having the gun selling it say_  

[_Fixed the italics. --- The Management_]  Talking guns are selling other guns? Sure you aren't still exhausted?

Also, I have a good "oh god why is there a gun, oh thank god it is not a gun" story.

I spent the first half of my junior year abroad and when I came back I was living with strangers. The second night or so, I am helping them look for the remote control. I look under the couch, and I see a pistol. This upsets me. I do not want to live with strangers who throw pistols casually under the couch. I reach out to touch it, just in case there has been a murder with this gun and I need to possibly incriminate myself, or in case my roomates are actually planning on shooting me I can have the jump on then. When I lift it, it is light, very light, and I am relieved. I am relieved enough that I sigh loudly, and my roomates notice. I tell them what happened, they laugh and laugh.

We send the rest of the year shooting each other with plastic BBs.

The all italics above demonstrates why I preview, even when I then forget to actually post.

I'll let the evidence speak for itself.  So I take it from that story that your roommates purchased that gun from the same talking gun that tried to sell me one?  That gun really gets around.

I do not like evidence and isn't my generation raised on the denial of immediate physical and factual evidence? 

Besides, I think I like my second telling better. 

But yes, the gun was purchased from a talking gun. It's probably a good thing as you didn't purchase one also, as my roomates had a history of making bad decisions, while I watched, thinking "they are making a bad decision."

Guns are not toys.  Scold your parents for not teaching you better.

There might be a cool vintage government featuring a talking gun:

If I went in there, I'd never come out.
