Aaron thinks [this confrontation between a law professor and student protestors](http://thenewinquiry.com/blogs/zunguzungu/who-are-you-going-to-believe-me-or-your-lying-ideology/)
 warrants an exercise in ideological self-reflection, but I don’t know. 
It seems to me more like an undergraduate film project designed to lure a
 wretched — though utterly harmless — beast from its natural environs so
 that the entire world might point and laugh at it.

I don’t know about you, but I can’t wait to see the final cut of _Concern Troll: The Movie._

Because the alternative is he’s just an asshole who doesn’t know what “antagonist” means.
