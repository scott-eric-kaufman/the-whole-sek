For the record, my favorite "voice" -- if you can imagine for a moment that a scholar thinks about such things -- is my computerized counterpart in these [DISADVENTURE!](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/disadventure.html) posts.  The narrative situation's a perfect storm of self-deprecation, and I love it.  That said, tomorrow's installment will be in an entirely different acephalitic voice ...

POETRY ensues?  My semi-serious poem about how in the much-scorned virtual communities you really don't know less about people than in some of the places that people think of as real-life community-building is in the same turn it off line as Byron the Bulb?  Sheesh.

By the way, since we're now all oversharing and all, today I read the first draft of a poem [written during that thread](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/cue\_blogwide\_st.html#comment-68359076) to one of the free critique groups that I was [ranting about](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/cue\_blogwide\_st.html#comment-69009578).   Result: total silence, followed by various versions of "I didn't get it", and then somebody pointing out that the girl not wanting to let go of the plastic ring in the poem could be like a _Lord of the Rings_ reference.  And it could!  So now there's a very slightly modified [second draft](http://home.att.net/~rpuchalsky/poetry/p\_or\_not\_p.html) with titles on the sections that tell tell tell people what they're supposed to mean and a bit of muddying the end of the second section for less Gollum action that will nevertheless still result in someone thinking that it's like _Lord of the Rings_ and the poem is now on its inevitable glide path from being clumsy and obscure to being clumsy and hamhanded.

Or I could come back here for "POETRY ensues".  Sheesh.

P.S.

Someone who writes good poetry introduced their reading of their poem at this critique with "This is a true story".  NO NO NO; if your poem doesn't convince people that it's true it can never be true; why not just put "This Is A True Story" in the title or something if you want people to always know that you're going to say that beforehand, since you aren't going to do it if / when you have that poem published.
