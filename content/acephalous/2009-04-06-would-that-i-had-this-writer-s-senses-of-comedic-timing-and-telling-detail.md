## Would that I had this writer's senses of comedic timing and telling detail.

Before I continue with some bits on Blake, I wanted to share this truly extraordinary bit of literary profiling from the current issue of _Rolling Stone_.  Everything about the opening anecdote to "The Last Outlaw Poet" works perfectly: the selection of the moment, the setting of the scene, the cadence of the prose, the timing of the punchline.  They all conspire to produce a powerful (and powerfully funny) introduction to a profile of Kris Kristofferson.  But you'll shit your pants when you learn—I'll save that bit of information for the moment.  Here's the text:

Standing backstage at the Beacon Theatre in New York, leaning against a crumbling brick wall in the dark, I could barely see Kris Kristofferson standing to my left.  Willie Nelson was in the shadows to my right.  Ray Charles was standing beside Willie, idly shifting his weight back and forth.  A bit farther along the wall were Elvis Costello, Wyclef Jean, Norah Jones, Shelby Lynne, Paul Simon and respective managers, friends and family.  Everybody was nervous and tight.  We were there for Willie Nelson's 70th birthday concert in 2003.  

Up from the basement came one of country music's brightest stars (who shall remain nameless).  At that moment in time, the Star had a monster radio hit about bombing America's enemies back into the Stone Age.  

"Happy birthday," the Star said to Willie, breezing by us.  As he passed Kristofferson in one long, confident stride, out of the corner of his mouth came "None of that lefty shit out there tonight, Kris."  

"What the fuck did you just say to me?" Kris growled, stepping forward.  

"Oh, no," groaned Willie under his breath.  "Don't get Kris all riled up."  

"You heard me," the Star said, walking away in the darkness.  

"Don't turn your back to me, boy," Kristofferson shouted, not giving a shit that basically the entire music industry seemed to be flanking him.  

The Star turned around: "I don't want any problems, Kris—I just want you to tone it down."  

"You ever worn your country's uniform?" Kris asked rhetorically.  

"What?"  

"Don't 'What?' me, boy!  You heard the question.  You just don't like the answer."  He paused just long enough to get a full chest of air.  "I asked, 'Have you ever served your country?'  The answer is, no, you have not.  Have you ever killed another man?  Huh?  Have you ever taken another man's life and then cashed the check your country gave you for doing it?  No, you have not.  So shut the _fuck_ up!"  I could feel his body pulsing with anger next to me.  "You don't know what the hell you are talking about!"  

"Whatever," the young Star muttered.  

Ray Charles stood motionless.  Willie Nelson looked at me and shrugged mischievously like a kid in the back of the classroom.  

Kristofferson took a deep inhale and leaned against the wall, still vibrating with adrenaline.  He looked over at Willie as if to say, "Don't say a word."  Then his eyes found me.  

"You know what Waylon Jennings said about guys like him?" he whispered.  

I shook my head.  

"They're doin' to country music what pantyhose did to finger-fuckin'."  

I would [Soltan through](http://www.margaretsoltan.com/?p=11201) that, pointing out the few missteps (like the ambiguous "he" in the "Don't 'What?' me, boy!" paragraph) and the many grace notes (catching Kristofferson's lack of contractions in the same paragraph, then gesturing to the Jennings impersonation via the dropped _g_s in the last line), but I can't.  Do you know why I can't?  

I can't because do you know who wrote that?  Do you know who so deftly captured Kristofferson's demolition of Toby Keith?  

_Ethan Fucking Hawke_.  

If you're like me and unable to accept that _Ethan Fucking Hawke_ can write circles around you, go listen to [the playlist Hawke put together to accompany the story](http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/27207147/the\_essential\_kris\_kristofferson) and try to comfort yourself with the fact that _Ethan Fucking Hawke_ had the help of a Rhodes Scholar turned Airborne Ranger turned boxer turned singer-songwriter in writing that.

I don't get it. Sure, Hawke's an actor. He's done Hamlet and Henry IV, and won Tony awards on stage; he's done some action movies, but also some reasonably serious ones. He's written two novels: he's clearly got some skills at dialogue and description.

Also, he was transcribing this: sure, some of the credit goes to the author, but this is Kris Kristofferson you're talking about here. The man uses the English language for a living, and specializes in short emotional pieces: an argument with an asshole "Star" is right in his strike zone. 

Fun stuff, but I don't get the angst, really.

Hawke also had a hand in writing Before Sunset, which granted, I haven't seen, but I'm a Before Sunrise fan and I'm guessing he made contributions to that also.

It took me about ten minutes of online puttering to come up with a name for "Star" (would have taken me less if I'd actually put some thought into it; took me a little longer to realize that Tomemos already knew it) and find "Star"'s [reaction](http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1608675/toby-keith-calls-out-reporter-over-retelling-of-rolling-stone-story.jhtml), which includes statements by Kristofferson and Nelson that the incident didn't happen. 

So we can give Hawke a lot more credit for writing, and a lot less for journalism....

_It took me about ten minutes of online puttering to come up with a name for "Star"_

But I told you who he was!  I'm your one-stop shop for needless trivia!

_So we can give Hawke a lot more credit for writing, and a lot less for journalism..._

First, Willie Nelson not remembering something is, well, par for the course.  Second, Kristofferson just said he didn't remember the encounter, and that he respects Keith, which is a far cry from denying it happened.  

_he was transcribing this_

But transcription is an art -- it's difficult to tell a story about something funny and have it be funny.  (Believe you me, this is something I work hard at.)  (Transforming petty bureaucratic indignities into something worth reading, that is.)

_But I told you who he was!_ 

You're right, though it didn't register. I was more interested, really, in the conceit that Hawke uses, that he could relate this without revealing the name of the person concerned; clearly he wasn't really trying to conceal the name as much as he was trying to generate interest.

_he didn't remember the encounter, and that he respects Keith, which is a far cry from denying it happened_

Maybe I'm just the sensitive sort: I tend to remember when I engage in energetic public discourse. Maybe not the exact words, but the memory tends to linger. 

_But transcription is an art_

True enough, though you'd expect a working journalist to be fairly good at it to begin with. But this looks less like transcription than like fiction at the moment.

Ahistoricality,

I'm guessing that Hawke -- who is indeed a fine artist, whatever prejudices Scott has about him -- concealed the identity, not so much to generate interest as to deal with the fact that if he had named Keith, and Keith had denied it, and no one had been willing to come on record (they have to work together in small industry where hot-tempered Keith pulls a lot of weight) to confirm it, then RS would, I'm guessing, pull it for liability reasons.  That doesn't mean the event _did_ happen, but I'll take Ethan Motherfunkin Hawke's word over Toby Keith's on pretty much anything.

Yeah, Ahistoricality, I think you're giving TK a little too much credit here.  (He has previously said—after the Iraq war had become unpopular with the majority—that he was never in favor of the Iraq war, if that helps you assess his credibility.)  One's word against another, but I know who I'm going to believe.  Also, is it not possible that Nelson remembers but is being diplomatic?

You're all assuming that I actually do believe Keith, or Kristofferson, or Hawke, or Nelson. Under the circumstances, there's really no reason to believe _any_ of them: too many competing interests and little-to-no history of credibility. I don't think Hawke's editors could possibly have believed that "unnamed" would remain nameless: it's a lawyerly fig leaf, at best, inviting controversy without having to pay for it....

I haven't the energy to get into an epistemological discussion about credibility and narrative right now: I have to look over my spouse's resume, finish editing the scanned-and-OCR'd haggadah for tomorrow night, pack away our chametz and, if there's time before sunrise, get some grading done so that I don't have _three_ stacks of assignments on my desk by Friday.

_finish editing the scanned-and-OCR'd haggadah_

Please please please tell me you're about to say that one about the Jew who was too cheap to buy a _Haggadah_, because I _love_ that one.\*

Also, I applaud you on _chametz_ hiding.  Since I moved out of my parents' house, I've never had enough money to deliberately not eat most of what I eat.  (That and there's no chance of me being an observant Jew in Orange County.  Valet _Shabbos_ where the valets laugh if you're not sporting a Lexus?  No thank you very much.)

\*Note: this joke may not actually exist yet, but damn it, it should.

Sorry about that.  The deaf guy didn't mean to step on toes, but I'm not sure what you mean: when you OCR a book, that's just turning scanned images of letters into manipulable text, right?  I'm guessing that's a prelude to something else then?  Like transferring the OCR'd text into Braille?  (I honestly don't know and intend no offense.)  (Outside the offense all Jews inflict upon themselves and other Jews, that is.)

No offense taken: I knew it was a bit obscure when I wrote it.

There are a number of devices which can reproduce electronic braille using refreshable cells ([1](http://www.humanware.com/en-usa/products/blindness/braillenotes), [2](http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs\_products/PACmate2.asp), [3](http://shop.aph.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product\_Braille+%!M(MISSING)obile%!M(MISSING)anager\_1-07450-01P\_10001\_11051), etc.) or make e-texts accessible with text-to-speech. Basically, any Word document, PDF (except the straight image ones), HTML, etc. electronic file with text in it can be read by the blind if they have one of these devices. 

You can translate straight text into grade 2 braille (more compressed, abbreviations, etc.) if you have a braille translator, and that can be read either by these braille notetakers (PDA's really) or run through an actual braille printer (big noisy things) to produce paper braille. But it's not strictly necessary.

There are [state agencies](http://www.loc.gov/nls/) and [non-profits](http://www.jbilibrary.org) which do some of this, but sometimes you have to do it yourself.
