## Dear Some Gay Guy, Do You Have Cliffs+Notes+David+Sedaris+Queer+Identity?

Its appearance in a public forum notwithstanding, this post is not for general consumption.  I wanted to inform Some Gay Guy who just left my apartment that thanks to his comments (and my damnable urge to provoke them), I'm now in the top 10 Google searches for:

*   "queer marketing disaster"*   "male intimacy"
*   "queer bias in" any book I've mentioned since I've started writing this thing

I know, I know.  You're probably not even home yet and I'm already mocking you.  It's a long walk up a steep hill, however, so I have time for some more, well, complaining.  I've noticed that an inordinate number of the hits from the various search engines are for "cliffs+notes+herr+dispatches" or "cliffs+notes+mcewan" or "cliffs+notes+whatever+novel+biography+book+I've+read+recently" and I'm beginning to wonder:  Do the people responsible for _Cliff's Notes_ send out spiders to collect information or are students so desperate for cheatin' material that they scour the 'net for hours looking for what they could've already written by the time they've tracked it down?

EDIT: Someone just googled "cliffs+notes+left+behind."  Either one of my loyal readers wants to see my head explode while processing that or _the world really is about to end_.

Go make a baby, you truly most wonderful person I've ever met who'd never edit a phrase like "bitchass" out of one of my comments.

You can also google "Sodomizing+any catchy phrase or name that's ever come up on your website" for a prominent hit.
