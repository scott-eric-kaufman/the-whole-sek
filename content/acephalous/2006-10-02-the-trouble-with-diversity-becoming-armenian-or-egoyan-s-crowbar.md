[_My first contribution to **The Trouble With Diversity** event, x-posted from [The Valve](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the\_trouble\_with\_diversity\_becoming\_armenian\_or\_egoyans\_crowbar/)._]

For Walter Benn Michaels, “culture” is a comforting fiction based on
an unscientific racial logic, an incoherent theory of historical
transmission, and a discredited linguistic essentialism.  I’ll leave
the last of those arguments to the experts who will show up later this
week; I’ll address the first two today—albeit obliquely, through a
reading of the Atom Egoyan film [_Next of Kin_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005KCAU/diesekoschmar-20)
(1984).  Egoyan seems the perfect foil for Michaels’ account of
identity—born in Egypt, raised in Canada, proudly Armenian—and yet,
with the notable exception of [_Ararat_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JLR5/diesekoschmar-20)
(2002), his identitarian commitments never drift into uncritical
sentimentality.  His obsession with historical and cultural
transmission, his probing of the _means_ by which memories intrude into the present moment, prevent such drift.  

No critic of Egoyan, academic or otherwise, has failed to notice how
“films-within-films populate [his] works, glimpses of guilt or pleasure
captured on tape and then twisted out of shape by a subsequent
perspective."[

](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/10/the\_trouble\_wit\_1.html#1)  Nor should they.  Egoyan directed the only watchable short in the [_Beckett on Film_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006FXQN/diesekoschmar-20) (2003) collection; his unostentatious [_Krapp’s Last Tape_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0802150551/diesekoschmar-20)
showcases his preoccupation with inaccurate, illegitimate transmission
of racial/cultural/historical memories.  Like Beckett in _Krapp’s Last Tape_,
Egoyan typically stages the interaction of individual and mechanical
memory as a conflict between an event, the cherished memory of it, an
initial reencounter with that memory, then all the subsequent ones. 
All these “reencounters” are mediated—Krapp’s by his tape-recorder,
Egoyan’s characters’ through home-movies (their own and others)—by
contraptions far less abstract and direct than the “ghosts of
historicism” Michaels discusses in [_The Shape of Signifier_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691118728/diesekoschmar-20): 

From Sethe’s standpoint, [Denver’s claim that “nothing
ever dies"] is, of course, a kind of threat; she and her contemporaries
are, as one critic has put it, “haunted by memories they seek to
avoid.” But if [_Beloved_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452280621/diesekoschmar-20)‘s
characters want to forget something that happened to them, its
readers—"black people,” “white people,” Morrison herself—are to
supposed to remember something that didn’t happen to them ... For
Morrison’s race ... provides the mechanism as well as the meaning of
the conversion of history into memory.  [Greg Bear’s] [_Blood Music_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743444965/diesekoschmar-20) requires [weird science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood\_Music) to explain how people can “remember stuff” they haven’t “even lived through” (197) ... _Beloved_ needs only race.[

I quote from the “Historicism” chapter of _The Shape of the Signifier_ not only because redacted chunks of it appear in _The Trouble With Diversity_,
but because I think his argument against the possibility of
cultural/racial/historical transmission far more forceful in the
original.  This detour allows me to establish a memorial hierarchy,
from the fantastic-technological (_Blood Music_) to the just plain technological (_Krapp’s Last Tape_) to the just plain fantastic (_Beloved_). 
A self-aware lymphatic system capable of cloning consciousness would be
the perfect vehicle for transmitting historical knowledge; modern day
recording equipment would be orders of magnitude worse; and while
powerful, the supernatural reappearance of dead children 
would be
 _is_
impossible.  Yet, as Michaels argues, because of its emotional
resonance, most Americans employ this impossibility whenever they think
about culture, which “is now being used as a virtual synonym for _racial identity_."[

To return to Egoyan: in _Next of Kin_, the bored, affectless
Peter escapes the Canadian suburbs by posing as the long-lost son of a
Toronto-area Armenian family, the Deryans, who had been put up for
adoption twenty years earlier.  He learns of their situation by
impersonating his therapist and charming his way past a temp into the
room where the videotaped sessions are stored.  Watching the Deryan
family—father George, mother Sonya and daughter Azah—arguing, he thinks
about his own family life, his parents’ constant quarreling over his
future, and decides to transform himself into Bedros, the child whose
absence threatens to tear the Deryan family apart.  He’ll become both
Armenian and a member of the middle-class.  Becoming the latter is easy
enough: he breaks from his family and joins the Deryan’s.  

Becoming Armenian, however, offers a greater challenge for the waspy Peter.  (I mean, _just [look](http://acephalous.typepad.com/nok1.jpg) [at him](http://acephalous.typepad.com/f003.gif)!_)  And yet, his desire to belong and the Deryan’s desire to accept him are so great that he _does_,
in some slippery sense, become Armenian by film’s end.  Shortly after
arriving in his new “home,” he picks up his sister’s Spanish guitar and
amateurishly plucks at its strings; but as the end credits roll, the
camera pans around her bedroom to beautiful stylings on a Spanish
guitar being played, as we see the second before the screen turns
black, by Peter/Bedros.  The impostor _acquires_ what he should have only been able to inherit: that Armenian _soul_, that supernatural connection to his community figured powerfully in _Beloved_.  ("_Just look at him!  So **Armenian**, now_“)
Now that it happened to “his” people, for example, he’ll also be
haunted by the legacy of the Armenian genocide, &c.  It is as if,
to paraphrase Michaels, learning how to rap didn’t make Peter a rapper,
but black.

Egoyan can create this ambiguity because his attention to the faulty
mechanisms of transmission parries the notion of inviolable identity. 
(Not that that makes Peter’s transformation into Bedros any less
unsettling.) His film captures the very identitarian appeal Michaels’
addresses: the creation, legitimate or no, of a common culture brings
order to the mental lives of its members.  However, it also highlights
the sorts of sacrifices such order entails: the acceptance of a lonely
suburban exile into the family and the end to the search for the actual
Bedros.  How you feel about this ending—whether you believe it the
celebration of a talented fraud or a statement of intense desire for
communities organized around a racialized culture—bears on how you’ll
feel about Michaels’ argument.  What is the _ideal_
outcome here?  Is it better for a community to remain blind to its
constituitive incoherence so long as no one gets hurt?  What about if
someone _did_ get hurt?  What if the community, by virtue of being a community, suffered?  

I want to end by veering away from the questions of authenticity
Egoyan’s dark film manages to ask playfully; instead, I’ll focus on
what I called, in the title to this post, “Egoyan’s crowbar.” As I
argued above, Egoyan’s obsession with the technologies of
cultural/racial/historical transmission alerts him to the
inconsistencies Michaels lays bear in _The Trouble With Diversity_. 
So do you think, maybe, that this is a question of genre?  Does
Egoyan’s realist obsession with verisimilitude—the means of its
creation and reproduction, as well as its limitations—immunize him
against identitarian appeals?  Does magic realism like Morrison’s lend
itself to a identitarian notion of community?  Do you believe writers
imagine community as such and thus write works of magic realism?  Or do
you think they write magic realism and convince themselves that’s how
commuity works?  

Yes, I know, incredibly general (and inflammatory) questions; but I
want to open the floor for discussion, and know that few amongst us can
resist the urge to write sweeping dismissals and/or defenses of entire
modes/genres/traditions.
