## Things Found in Books: Invitations to Watch T.V.

The difference between having a blog and not having a blog isn't (as some argue) that I waste time writing nonsense for no one instead of working on my dissertation; no, the difference is that I now preserve for posterity fleeting thoughts and impressions which would've otherwise evanesced.  Case in point: 

Back when I started researching the history of evolutionary theory, almost every book I checked out had this index card shoved in it:

[![Invitation\_3](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/2007/05/27/invitation\_3.jpg "Invitation\_3")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/05/27/invitation\_3.jpg)

At the time, I thought little of them.  They were bookmarks, and I gave them as much thought as I do the receipts, napkins, bills and credit cards I use as bookmarks now.  Had I been blogging, I would've done what I did when one slipped out of Jill Kress's _[The Figures of Consciousness](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415939798/diesekoschmar-20)_ last night, _i.e._ seek out this Dr. David Breese and see why he had invited readers of evolutionary theory to listen to him (or his friend) on the T.V channel 40 every Sunday morning.  (If only to alert [P.Z. Myers](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/) to the newest front in the War on Darwin.)  

Not that I would've been surprised by [what I found](http://www.raptureready.com/who/Dave\_Breese.html), it's just that the idea that a "Rapture Ready" creationist would have thought stuffing books on evolutionary theory with an invitation to _listen_ to him on the television a good idea.  Who would want to listen to someone (or his friend) on television?  Who would want to listen to _the_ T.V. Channel 40 when you could _watch_ more entertaining people (and their friends) on all the other Channel 40s? 

Why would anyone think that stuffing books with crudely-typed, off-center "invitations" a successful way to increase the Rapture Readiness of the American citizenry?  I don't know, but I aimed to find out.  Dr. Breese has been dead over five years, after all, so I wager he has something interesting to say.  So I recorded the T.V. Channel 40 at 12:00 and guess what I found?  

Dr. [Ed Hindson](http://www.raptureready.com/who/Ed\_Hindson.html)—very alive, very kicking—warning me of the dangers of _The Da Vinci Code_.  Somehow, I expected more from the T.V. Channel 40.

Yesterday, this fell out of _Professions of Taste_ by Jonathan Freedman: "xxxxxxxxxx@hotmail.com | surfer room - 30$ night"

I have no idea what this means, or how to connect it to the Jamesian motif of the portrait.

"However, Dave's main reference point is prophecy, the news of tomorrow. Therefore, the books he wrote in the early 80’s are just as timely today as they were back then."

Ah prophecy, news of tomorrow. I also recommend paying a small subscription fee for Prophecy Prime, delivering the best in opinions about the news of tomorrow.

When you want the news before it happens, there's prophecy. When you want to know what people aren't yet saying about what hasn't so far occurred, there's Prophecy Prime™.
