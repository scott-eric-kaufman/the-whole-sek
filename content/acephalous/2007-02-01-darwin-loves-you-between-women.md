(That's how he rolls.)

I want to thank the kind soul who mailed me copies of George Levine's _[Darwin Loves You: Natural Selection and the Re-enchantment of the World](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691126631/diesekoschmar-20)_ and Sharon Marcus' [_Between Women: Friendship, Desire, and Marriage in Victorian England_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691128359/diesekoschmar-20).  The Levine looks to be especially relevant—reading the first chapter, he seems to attribute to Darwin influence which rightly belongs to Lamarck, so my dissertation remains earth-shattering in its potential—and the Marcus was recommended by [Amanda Claybaugh](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0801444802/diesekoschmar-20) at the MLA, so I'm looking forward to reading both.  

However, in the future you ought to slip a note in the box indicating who you are, lest I feel like an ungrateful lout when I run into you (again?) and fail to thank you for the thoughtful, generous gift.
