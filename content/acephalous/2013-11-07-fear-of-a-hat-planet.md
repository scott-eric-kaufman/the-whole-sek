_Remember [SEK's NEIGHBOR](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/10/crucial-omitted-detail-he-was-wearing-bright-red-shorts-and-had-tucked-a-yellow-polo-shirt-into-them)?
 The one who thought SEK belonged to a gang because of his backward hat?
 Well, this morning SEK decided it was about time to start watching **The Sopranos**,
 and so when he was driving home from the grocery store and saw his 
NEIGHBOR, SEK thought it'd be a great idea to slow his car to a crawl 
and give NEIGHBOR a good eye-fucking. The fake neighborhood "police" 
started driving around until, finally, MR. POLICEMAN -- with NEIGHBOR in
 tow -- knocked on SEK's door._

**MR. POLICEMAN:** Have you been threatening this man?

**SEK:** What? No.

**MR. POLICEMAN:** Is that your car?

**SEK:** Yes.

**MR. POLICEMAN:** He says a man in a hat was threatening him this morning.

**SEK:** (_points to hair_) I'm not wearing a hat.

**NEIGHBOR:** It's you! You have a hat!

**SEK:** I'm sure I do _somewhere_. What's this about, officer?

**MR. POLICEMAN:** Have you been speeding recently?

**SEK:** I've been in Houston, my sister just had a baby. Wanna see [a picture](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/11/and-what-do-we-say-to-the-god-of-death)?

**NEIGHBOR:** He has a hat!

**MR. POLICEMAN:** So you haven't been speeding?

**SEK:** I haven't even been here.

**NEIGHBOR:** Ask him about his hat?

**SEK:** Do you need a hat, sir?

**NEIGHBOR:** I want to see your hat!

**SEK:** Officer, should I get him a hat?

**MR. POLICEMAN:** I don't think that'll be necessary. Sorry to have bothered you, sir.

_NEIGHBOR looks at SEK. SEK waits until the officer turns around, then eye-fucks NEIGHBOR again._

**NEIGHBOR:** ASK HIM ABOUT HIS HAT!

**MR. POLICEMAN:** (_to NEIGHBOR_) We're done here.

**NOT REALLY AN UPDATE:** For the record, what [I thought was going to happen](https://www.facebook.com/scotterickaufman/posts/10102129454463041) turned out to be funnier. What's the point of living life as if it were performance art if it refuses to perform? Sigh:

The fake neighborhood "police" just drove by, and I can't
 help but wonder what they're looking for: "Suspect is an off-white 
late-model academic, so use extreme caution, he may have an ethnicity. 
Repeat: he may have an ethnicity."

(And after they bust in and shoot me, they'll be all like, "It's 
terrible, sir, it's terrible. The books! THEY"RE EVERYWHERE. On the 
floor, there're little ones on the table, looks like he broke their 
spines. OH THE HUMANITIES!")
