## The Mann Act? <em>Really</em>?

[_I meant to post this on [Edge of the American West](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/), but Eric and Ari neglected to give me the admin privileges I so richly deserve, so I'm stuck posting it here._]

According to the _Wall Street Journal_, Governor Spitzer will be charged with violating what is popularly called the Mann Act, but which Congress passed as [the White Slave Traffic Act.](http://www.pbs.org/unforgivableblackness/knockout/mannact\_text.html)  It was designed to  "regulate interstate commerce and foreign commerce by prohibiting the
transportation therein for immoral purposes of women and girls, and for
other purposes."  That the bill prohibits transportation for "immoral purposes" and "other purposes" is as problematically vague as you suppose.  Shortly after its passage, the _Virginia Law Review_ voiced its concern that those phrases grant:
the statute such sweeping comprehensiveness as to include every form of conduct contrary to good order. 

Or as the _New York Times_ put it:

GIVES WIDE SCOPE   
TO WHITE SLAVE LAW  
\_\_\_\_\_


  
Supreme Court Holds That the   
Act is Not Limited to Com-  
mercialized Vice.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_


  
INCLUDES ESCAPADES ALSO

The Act not only included escapades, it threatened to criminalize _all_ larks, shenanigans, antics, frolics, capers, flings, and high jinks—at least as practiced by the citizenry.  Because the very same ambiguity allowed ideologues in police departments and district attorney offices to prosecute anyone and everyone for anything and everything.  The first person arrested under the act, heavy-weight champion [Jack Johnson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack\_Johnson\_%!b(MISSING)oxer%!)(MISSING), was charged with consorting with his white wife shortly after defeating "[The Great White Hope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James\_J.\_Jeffries)" in "[The Fight of the Century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack\_Johnson\_%!b(MISSING)oxer%!#(MISSING)The\_.22Fight\_of\_the\_Century.22)" in what is most certainly a coincidence.  (Also coincidental: the judge who presided over Johnson's case was none other than [Kenesaw Mountain Landis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenesaw\_Mountain\_Landis), who while serving as the commissioner of Major League Baseball, [blocked the sale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenesaw\_Mountain\_Landis#The\_baseball\_color\_line) of teams to owners who would integrate their roster.)

As H.L. Mencken [noted](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19355/19355-h/19355-h.htm), this expansiveness was a feature, not a bug:
It was carried through Congress, over the veto of President
Taft, who discerned its extravagance, on the plea that it was needed to
put down the traffic in prostitutes; it is enforced today against men
who
[]()
are no more engaged in the traffic in prostitutes than you or I.
Naturally enough, the effect of this extension of its purposes, against
which its author has publicly protested, has been to make it a truly
deadly weapon in the hands of professional Puritans and of denouncers of
delinquency even less honest. "Blackmailers of both sexes have arisen,"
says Mr. Justice McKenna, "using the terrors of the construction now
sanctioned by the [Supreme] Court as a help—indeed, the means—for
their brigandage. The result is grave and should give us pause."

Lest you think Mencken's merely grinding another of his innumerable axes, in 1936 the _Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology_ comforts its readers with this balm salve:
Although many believe the "Mann Act" has become a dead letter through the policy of non-enforcement, a recent statement by J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations, shows that this is not true.  He said: "During ... the month of June, 1936, there were more convictions for the violations of the White Slave Traffic Act than in any month during the past three years."

What does all of this mean for Spitzer?  I don't know.  Maybe some of you legal types know how the Mann Act works behind the scenes.  It obviously could be used to coerce testimony from someone.  (The _Times_ didn't dub it "the Encouragement of Blackmail Act" for nothing now.)

There really was supposed to be a "coy" between "with and "me."  In fact, I remember typing it.  That's just weird.

In my natal neighborhood "Don't play with me." meant the same thing as "Don't play coy with me."

Mine, too, JPOOL.  But I didn't want to assume the same was true for everyone.  And Luther, I'm really not sure I'm following you.  You think Spitzer's fall will yield victory for McCain in the general?

Wait, it was supposed to be "don't play with coy me"?

Humbert Humbert was knowledgeable about the Mann Act,   the Children and Young Persons Act of 1933, and the age of consent in various jurisdictions and in Roman Catholic canon law. He makes the requisite joke about the name of Mann Act.

At my URL I tell you who the model for Humbert Humbert was, and also many other things.

[Paterno State University](http://www.libraries.psu.edu/nabokov/sweeney1.htm) has posted an interesting piece on  the legal ramifications of _Lolita_.
