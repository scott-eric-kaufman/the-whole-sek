... I should share the answer to the trivia question [I asked last week](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/03/i-write-like-mu.html):
Aristotle.

I better not see anyone trying to pass or collect anything or I will report you.  

You _are_ welcome to smack your forehead in ritualistic expiation of the  profound embarrassment you should now feel.  

The answer was _so_ obvious I almost feel guilty springing the next post on you now.
