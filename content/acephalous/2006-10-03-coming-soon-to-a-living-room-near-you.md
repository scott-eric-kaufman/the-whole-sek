[Thomas Pynchon](http://www.pw.org/directory/writer\_detail.php?writer\_id=5275)!  Maybe that's standard language.  Maybe every entreaty will meet with firm dismissal.  Still, the _possibility_ of a Pynchon book tour thrills me.  

What will he look like?  An apparition in helmet and cape?   Plechazunga the Pig-Hero?  [Paper or plastic](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/13/Pynchon-Simpsons-001.jpg)?  I'm a-twitter with anticipation.\*

\* _i.e._ well-nigh primed for the inevitable bitter disappointment.
