## Dull, Dry Historicism, Eminent Medievalists, Literary Journalism and Rank Despair, Laughed Away

[_A response to Luther Blissett's [comment](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/he\_liked\_to\_imb.html#comment-25727575) instead of a post.  Why?  Because minutiae oppress me, words fail me and with every day the odds of my future career in real estate increase ever so slightly._]

Part of the problem with our
profession is that wowing gets jobs, but people need to fill in the
details. So, for example, David Wallace's [_Chaucerian Polity_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0804736618/diesekoschmar-20) is a brilliant
book, but one Wallace couldn't have written without much of the "drudge
work" accomplished by "lesser" scholars in the pages of _Speculum_.
The profession needs both, but only recognizes one. (Not so true in
medieval studies or early modern studies, but you see my point.) 

At times, the historicist critic is afraid to venture out
of the realm of brute facts, because of the Hayden White conundrum: the
belief that all narrative forms are "fictions" and so are lies.

Well, I wouldn't call them "lies" but "creative transformations."
What I'm interested in is the way people take this body of scientific
knowledge and transform it to conform with preexisting beliefs, other
bodies of thought (aesthetic theory, romantic individualism, &c.).
So I'm uninterested in narrating events, because that's the realm of
the historian proper. I think many historicists are intellectual
historians who focus on shifts in thought as reflected in literature, _i.e._ Menand focuses on the Civil War's effect on William James' thought in [_The Metaphysical Club_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374528497/diesekoschmar-20),
whereas I'd focus on its influence on brother Henry. (Not that I am,
just making a point.) That said, I still want to ground my accounts of
shifts in thought to the material I've dredged up. 

For example, at a talk I attended recently, someone asked the speaker "Wouldn't it be _reeeeeeeeeally_
interesting if the person you're talking about was familiar with this
particular strain of theory?" 

"Yes," the speaker replied, "but I have
no evidence that she was." 

The questioner followed: "Maybe, but could
you speculate about what it would mean if she had?" 

The speaker
obliged, but sitting there in the audience, I couldn't help but feel
there was something deeply wrong with whole performance—and that
"something" has to do with the oddity of historicist projects in
literature departments. I'm still thinking about how to frame this,
though, because it seems like it should be part of some larger
conversation about the profession. Right now, it's an anecdote and an
uneasy feeling but little more.

Let's remember that "the non-fiction novel" is just an
awkward way of saying "history." And historians have successfully
negotiated the need to balance truth and meaningfulness for several
centuries.

I'm not buying that definition of the non-fiction novel.  History, as a profession, had moved _away_
from the techniques of fiction employed by the New Journalism because
they were considered "unprofessional." While it may be another mode of
"historical" writing, the concomitant commitment to truth and the
storytelling was innovative. You had both present, in differing
degrees, in something like Hersey's [_Hiroshima_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679721037/diesekoschmar-20) or Mitchell's [_Up in the Old Hotel_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679746315/diesekoschmar-20),
only Hersey wasn't much of a novelist and Mitchell frequently created
composite characters to better communicate the mood he sought. You
could venture further back—and I did when I taught the "Evolution of
Literary Journalism" course, a historical survey beginning with
Thucydites and working forward—but the genre lacked an ethos before the
New Journalism. (I know Capote invented that final scene in [_In Cold Blood_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679745580/diesekoschmar-20),
but that just means he failed to live up to the courage of his
commitments. Wolfe sharing the interior monologue of a dead monkey shot
into space, on the other hand, is just plain weird.) 

The short version is a tidy corollary of my historicism—my interest
in literary journalism is the result of my investment of the literary-_qua_-literary,
the techniques which warp history into something greater, more
revealing, than brute chronicled facts. The attitude of the literary
journalist is fundamentally different from that of the historian, a
fact which alters both how and what they produce.

_the techniques which warp history into something greater, more revealing, than brute chronicled facts._ 

of course selection ensure that no collection of facts is simply a set of facts free of narrative. I just googled hayden + white + annals, and I got [a  quite quite interesting little article](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0093-1896(198122)7%!A(MISSING)4%!C(MISSING)784%!A(MISSING)%!O(MISSING)UY7A%!E(MISSING)2.0.CO%!B(MISSING)2-P) by Marilyn Robinson\* Waldman, ""The Otherwise Unnoteworthy Year 711": A Reply to Hayden White," _Critical Inquiry_ 7 (1981): 784-92. Waldman observes, among other things, that viewing lists in Annals as brute sets of facts awaiting the arrival of full-blown narrative history relies not only on a facile distinction between narrative and non-narrative forms, it's also, for various reasons, Eurocentric. Short article, (still) worth reading.

\* Not the same as Marilynne Robinson.
