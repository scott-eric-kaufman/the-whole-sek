## How Literature Registers, Reflects, Represents or Otherwise Transmogrifies Dull Dry History: A Query

Miriam’s derailed my earnest desire to avoid heavy lifting for the time being with an entry (cross-posted to [her blog](http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the\_little\_professor/2005/06/ihistorical\_thi.html) and [Cliopatria](http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/12469.html))
on how best to incorporate historical information into English
classes.  The traditional approach to history in an English course
is typically uni-directional.  For pedagogical reasons,
English-types presume history an unchanging stable scrim onto which
they project the complexities of a literary text: “Look,
children, look!  Labor trouble at the turn-of-the-century! 
What does _Looking Backward_ say about it?  How does
Bellamy’s novel allegorize, reflect, register, represent,
symbolize or otherwise transmogrify that dull dry history into a
capital-A work of Art?"\* As Miriam points out, “it’s very
easy to slip into the habit of presenting historical background
stripped of its own disciplinary signposts--especially when we
don’t actually know the debates surrounding our history of
choice.” She further “suspect[s] that many of us--[herself]
included--present the history as somehow denuded of disagreement, while
emphasizing the complexity of the assigned literary works.” Her
suspicion’s justified.

When teaching a novel as influential as _Looking Backward_ the
problem becomes even thornier: to stick with the scrim-metaphor, now
the complex literary work isn’t merely being projected on the
scrim, _it’s altering its molecular composition_.  The
dim pinks become bright reds and the dark purples pale to lavender as
the advent of an evangelical Christian socialism sweeps across the
country.  Should an English professor foreground the
novel-as-impetus-for-cultural-change or the
cultural-moment-ripe-for-an-impetuous-novel?  (Yes, I desperately
need to refresh my German.  Or forget it entirely.) Short of
resorting to a clumsy New Historicist leveling of _all_
discourses, I’m curious as to how you, dear readers, confront
(and confound) these dilemmas in the classroom or your own work. 
Or do you consider historical and formal questions utterly divorced and
English professors only qualified to speak to the latter?  

\*Could I come up with a clunkier and more unartistic novel to stand as
my exemplar of an aesthetic interpretation of an historical moment?
