Somehow I ended up on [Psyche's Links](http://www.psyche.com/psyche/links/blogs2.html), the place to go when you want information about "General References and Esoteric Study" about things like "Qabala," "Astrology," "Gematria," and "Gnostic Hebrew Resources."  Did they suss out I'm Jewish?  Or did my love of "Sacred Geometry" finally out?  

All of which is another way of saying "Of everyone in the long and storied history of human existence, how did I end up here?"
