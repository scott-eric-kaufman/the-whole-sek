## Evolutionary Ideology, or the Stuff of Shuddering

Via [La Lecturess](http://lecturess.blogspot.com/) (herself via [Inside Higher Ed](http://www.insidehighered.com/around\_the\_web)) or via [The Panda's Thumb](http://www2.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/07/victim\_of\_the\_wedge.html):

Cardinal Christoph Schonborn, "[a theologian who is close to Pop Benedict XVI](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/09/science/09cardinal.html?hp&ex=1120881600&amp;en=8f8f477d0e53f308&ei=5094&partner=homepage)," is "redefining" the Church's position on evolutionary theory in the _New York Times_'  Op-Ed pages.  [According to Schonborn](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/opinion/07schonborn.html)--whose names bears an umlaut over the second "o" which Typepad refuses to register--while
evolution in the sense of common ancestry might be true ... evolution in the neo-Darwinian sense--an unguided, unplanned process of random variation and natural selection--is not.  Any system of thought that denies or seeks to explain away the overwhelming evidence for design in biology is ideology, not science. 

Where to begin?  With the appropriation of humanistic rhetoric against the sciences?  Why not.  I've read Sandra Harding and know that the critique of the science studies  in general, and feminist science studies in particular, is often misplaced.  I have no patience with the anti-realist social constructivist position in its strong form, but I recognize that its weak form speaks to a general truth: namely, that to maintain the cultural, historical, sexual or even individual contingency of all claims to knowledge doesn't _ipso facto_ deny of the possibility of accurate or objective reckonings of the world.\*  I know that.  Am on board.  With the program.  

But I recognize that Sandra Harding causes problems when she says stuff like:
the Third World forms of democratic, pacific,
life-maintaining,
and communal tendencies so at odds with the imperialistic, violent,
consuming,
and possessively individualistic ones that critics find in Western
sciences and
culture. (Obviously the former are not always well practiced in Third
World
cultures prior to the expansion into them of European culture, nor
are they
absent from First World cultures, as the postcolonial critics are
perfectly
aware and as they always caution.) The result would be many, culturally
different sciences, each with culturally diverse origins--but central
among the
elements most valued in each case would be those that advance cooperation,
democracy, the richness of indigenous achievements, and sustainable
development.

Advocating the creation of "culturally different sciences"--removing, even momentarily, the strong materialist claims subtending the better work in science studies--puts into the hands of those who would disembowel science of everything scientific the rhetoric of self-marginalization the good Cardinal employs.  Evolutionary theory, the culture of the Catholic Church can argue, is a misnomer.  What we as Catholics oppose is the _ideology_ of evolutionary theory _imposed_ upon us by a secular scientific community.  The call for a feminist, post-modern or post-colonial science could (and has) slipped silently into a call for post-scientific science.  Given the general tenor of the contemporary scene, frankly I'm frightened by the idea that a prominent Cardinal can publish an anti-evolutionary editorial in "The Newspaper of Record" and expect it to be taken seriously.

\*I may have cribbed that from somewhere.  Bits of that sentence are in a notebook but I can't tell whether they're bits of my thought or bits of someone else's.  So if it's plagiarism, it's unintentional and I apologize, profusely, in advance.  (And promise to be more careful with my friggin' notes.)

Maybe I'm just more cynical than you about the average level of thought in Christian America, but to me the statement that "evolution in the sense of common ancestry might be true" is actually a breath of fresh air and suggeests a certain groovy willingness to go with the idea that evolution is probably "objectively" true, even if we can't really /say/ so (wink wink). I'm rather inclined to see it as intellectual progress, not as proof that post-modern theory has sealed an unholy alliance with the dark princes of the Church. But this is your area of expertise, about which I know nothing, and I could be way off.

After reading the MYT article (which I should have done before), I gotta say the revised Catholic position still looks mighty appealing by comparison to even mainsteam American Protestantism and makes me proud to be a Catholic boy. The proud Scholastic tradition of the wink-and-nudge lives on.

It's not really revised Catholic doctrine.  Pope John Paul II said basically the same thing in the late 1990s (he claimed that evolutionary theory was more than just a hypothesis but that Catholics still needed to believe that God ultimately guided evolution), and he was just restating Pope Pius XII from the 1950s.
