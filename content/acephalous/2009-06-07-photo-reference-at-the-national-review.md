## Photo reference at the <em>National Review</em>

Liberals think the cover of the new _National Review_ is racist, but as Rich Lowry [explains](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGM5OTFjMmY1NWQ2YmQzYzc4MDUyNjQzOWNlZjYwYTM=), they’re simply oversensitive and humorless:

You gotta move fast when you’re competing with your
fellow hair-trigger PC cops on the left! I take it the theory is that
we don’t think Latinas can be wise so we had to make her look somewhat
Asian. Or something like that. What these people don’t understand is
the entire concept of caricature (or of a joke). _Caricature always involves exaggerating someone’s distinctive features, which is all that our artist Roman Genn did [with Sotomayor](http://levellers.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/sotommayor1.jpg)._

He even includes what is, presumably, one of the reference photos
Genn used. When someone else points out that it’s odd that they
depicted her as Asian, Lowry [shot back](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTk2MWM4YmFiZDMyZmQ3ZDIwNDI1NTIyYTRiNWE2NGI=):

An outraged [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/05/inational-reviewi-perplex\_n\_211931.html) says we “perplexingly” depict Sotomayor in an Asian manner—apparently not entirely getting the [Buddha reference](http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://chantingbudha.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/buddha5.jpg&imgrefurl=http://chantingbudha.wordpress.com/2008/12/02/beautiful-images-of-lord-buddha/&usg=\_\_uX6wjRB2rDFbYgOd\_DuKmbamXzU=&h=876&w=638&sz=125&hl=en&start=12&tbnid=xknymV-MtWDfPM:&tbnh=146&tbnw=106&prev=/images%!F(MISSING)q%!D(MISSING)buddha%!g(MISSING)bv%!D(MISSING)2%!h(MISSING)l%!D(MISSING)en), or Buddha’s association with wisdom. Can they really be this clueless?

The painting in the Google link is, I think we can say with
certainty, the one Genn referenced for his cover.  (Compare everything
from the neck down.)  In visual terms, then, Lowry’s argument is thus:

		

					[]()
			

[![Sotomayor01](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156fda00b5970c-500pi "Sotomayor01")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156fda00b5970c-pi) 

Keeping in mind that “[c]aricature always involves exaggerating _someone_’s distinctive features, which is all that our artist Roman Genn did [with Sotomayor](http://levellers.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/sotommayor1.jpg),” I think it’s obvious that the _National Review_ didn’t
insult Sotomayor.  They merely exaggerated her distinctively slanted
eyes—wait, can we compare the photo references for the cover again, only
this time zoomed in on the eyes?

[![Sotomayor02](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156fda00eb970c-500pi "Sotomayor02")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156fda00eb970c-pi) 

As I suspected, the “someone” whose features are being “exaggerated”
on the cover is neither Sotomayor nor Buddha, but the man so grand they
named a peril after him:

[![Yellowclaw](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011570cf1571970b-500pi "Yellowclaw")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011570cf1571970b-pi)   


Wait—can I get another one of those closeups?

[![Sotomayor03](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156fda01ce970c-500pi "Sotomayor03")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156fda01ce970c-pi) 

That’s not an _exaggeration_ of the racist depiction of Asians like Yellow Claw, _that’s_ _a racist depiction of Asians_.  The logic—such that it is—of the _National Review_ editorial
board seems to be that since everyone knows Asians are better than
Latinos, no one can call them racist if they compare Sotomayor to an
Asian.  That argument—such that it is—could’ve made more forcefully if
they made it without validating the charge against them.  (“They think
we hate the wetbacks!  How can we prove otherwise?”  “Compare them to
the chinks!”  “Brilliant!”)

Well done, Scott.  All that's left to add is that anyone who sees clear racism in the speech Sotomayor gave, but sees this illustration as just a simple caricature, has a serious mental disorder (known, I believe, as Republicanism).

Damn it, tomemos, I wish I'd made that point.  But you're right, the cognitive dissonance here is outrageous.

Ahistoricality, I was all set to write about the teeth, but decided that since I'm making a strong claim here---that these were the actual pictures the editor, Lowry, sent to the artist, Genn---that the teeth could, arguably, be an artifact of [the photo itself](http://levellers.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/sotommayor1.jpg).  Not _likely_, given the fact that they used racist Chinese/Japanese art to transform a Latina into an Southeast Indian deity, but I didn't want to open myself up to that line of argument.

"Not likely, given the fact that they used racist Chinese/Japanese art to transform a Latina into an Southeast Indian deity, but I didn't want to open myself up to that line of argument."

The teeth are, imho, far weaker evidence than the eyes. The eyes are really blatant. The teeth aren't as exaggerated. The mouth seems to be a fairly typical caricature mouth, and its proportions are more natural than the mouth on the propaganda poster. She has large teeth, but they aren't pronounced buck teeth nor do they take up most of her lower face. Most of the Asian stereotype illustrations I've seen show a smile that goes nearly from ear to ear and has huge upper teeth.

They changed the shape of the mouth to accentuate the front teeth: it's not an artifact, but a choice. 

They also, for reasons I don't even want to begin to think about, made her hair look more disordered, grungy.

"hey changed the shape of the mouth to accentuate the front teeth"

Didn't change it that much. But most caricatures accentuate the teeth. The caricaturist at the state fair will probably accentuate your kids' teeth. Search Google for political caricatures, and you'll find everyone from Sarah Palin to Tony Blair to Silvio Berlusconi with accentuated teeth and mouths. 

Given the ridiculously racist eyes, I don't see any point harping on the mouth.

There's a difference between genre generalities and [specific cases](http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/speccoll/dspolitic/pm/1942/21013acs.jpg).

"Search Google for political caricatures, and you'll find everyone from Sarah Palin to Tony Blair to Silvio Berlusconi with accentuated teeth and mouths. "

I can't comment on the others, but Tony Blair's teeth were accentuated because he was notorious, in the early years, for his perpetual inane grin.

"There's a difference between genre generalities and specific cases."

I think we're going to have to agree to disagree. I don't think the mouth is exaggerated enough for it to be definitively racist. Maybe the artist was aiming to include both the mouth and eye stereotypes, but given how exaggerated the eyes are, I'd think he would have exaggerated the mouth more than he did.

I agree that we disagree: "given how exaggerated the eyes are" I don't see why I would consider giving the artist a pass on the almost equally racist mouth.

Speaking of a racist mouth, "In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India. You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts to buy the racist magazine National Review unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking," Biden might have said.

Check out [Pedro X. Molina's blog]() (tag line: Más monos que en el planeta de los simios), which shows the caricature of Judge Sonia Sotamayor placed prominently on Friday's edition of the Los Angeles Times' Op-Ed Page.  Please be so kind as to tell me why this depiction is significantly different than the "racist" depiction used by the National Review, that is, if it isn't racist too.
