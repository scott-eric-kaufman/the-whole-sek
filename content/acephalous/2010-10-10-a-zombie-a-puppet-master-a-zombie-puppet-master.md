The official White House photostream needs to consider how the photographs it posts will be photoshopped by its opponents.  [For example](http://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/5063426974/in/photostream/):

[![zombie puppetmaster obama](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/zombie-puppetmaster-obama.jpg "zombie puppetmaster obama")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/zombie-puppetmaster-obama.jpg)

I only went with the obvious ones in the title, but other possibilities abound.  For example, the foreshortened arm there is begging for this:

[![zombie puppetmaster obama2](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/zombie-puppetmaster-obama2.jpg "zombie puppetmaster obama2")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/zombie-puppetmaster-obama2.jpg)

The administration could at least up the degree of difficulty for its critics.

And if it ever came out that the stream was editted as you suggest, it would be "Triumph of the Will" all over again.

i dunno.  All the murder makes it pretty easy for me to criticize them without going to some silly picture book.
