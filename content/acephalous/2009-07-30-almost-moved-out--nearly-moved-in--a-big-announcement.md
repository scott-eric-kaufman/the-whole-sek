## Almost moved out & nearly moved in & a big announcement.

There is much to be done at the old place and even more at the new.  So posting will be light.  

Maybe even lighter.  

Because in addition to the unpacking and the reorganizing, I must mark thirteen more student drafts; revise an article that was accepted nearly a decade after the fact; continue to work on the book that will be finished by the end of summer; and draft a post for the much-bigger-than-this-blog I'll be half-joining next week to cover a particular beat.  

Feel free to speculate about the identity of the blog and the beat in the comments.  (The more random the speculation the greater the likelihood of you being correct.  Make of that what you will.)

The Corner, at the National Review, where you'll be providing non-Marxist reviews of comic books?

I was going (like Todd) to say CT but your comment about randomness makes me think, no way. So I will toss my hat in with Ahistoricality and say The Corner, or possibly Powerline.

Comics?  You could see me doing comics.  Unfogged?  I suppose since I'm a "former regular" at this point, it'd be surprising for me to elevated to a poster . . . but no.  Crooked Timber?  You're not even trying!  I'm friends with John, Michael, and Scott, and was on a panel with Eszter last year.  The Corner, my own politics aside, would be predictable, inasmuch as it's about the kind of politics I write about, only from the other side of the aisle.  In terms of its relation to my normal written output, Go Fug Yourself would win, were we playing bocce ball.

_Your summer sounds much more successfully productive than mine._

JPool, I always [have plans](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/finish\_silar\_we.html).  It's all about the execution.  (This summer, though, is doable.)

_You'll be guest-blogging about movies at Michael Berube's?_

Been there, [done that](http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/the\_re\_return\_of\_arbitrary\_but\_fun\_friday/).  (You know, if you're online long enough, you'll have been/done/planned just about everything, I think.)

Flavia, Dr. B. and I have now been on three panels together, so that's not that unlikely . . . although, given that she [made fun of me](http://bitchphd.blogspot.com/2009/07/linky-monday-from-sublime-to-banal.html) recently, I suppose it could be.  (Not that it smarts, mind you.)

(By which I mean, I only cry on the inside, and not that often even.)

(Like twice a day.)

(On good days.)

It's not one of my blogs, is it? I mean, if it _were_ I should probably know about it, but I lose track of what's going on with about two thirds of them.
