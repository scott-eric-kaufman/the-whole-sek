On behalf of one of [the classiest blogs](http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/) out there, I urge you to please _try harder_:

[![Obama\_nobel\_fail](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a629bb63970c-500pi "Obama\_nobel\_fail")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a629bb63970c-pi)   

I somehow doubt Abbas Raza appreciates the irony you forced upon him.Â

Actually, it's kind of the charm of Google ads: their keyword triggers are so blunt that I'm frequently presented with ads for products and positions which are quite _diverse_ from my own..... economically pointless, perhaps, but since we so often complain about the balkanization of the blogosphere, a strong countervailing position by a market leader!

I didn't think I could love Obama more today than yesterday.

But I do.
