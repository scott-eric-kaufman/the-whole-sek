Everyone thinks this all the time, but rarely in public, much less the pages of _American Literary History_ (Spring 1998):
Neither Hendler, Klein, nor Nackenoff treats the issue that most interests me about [Horatio Alger's] _Ragged Dick_.Â 

(To be fair, the issue that interests this reviewer is interesting: "Why does nobody notice that this model of boyish honesty is lying all the time?")
