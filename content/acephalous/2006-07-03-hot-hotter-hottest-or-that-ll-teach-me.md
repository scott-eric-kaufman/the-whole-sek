The weather has prevented posting, commenting and general internet activities today.  I hope to be back tomorrow.  I was able to compose a [semi-intelligent response](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/new\_data\_effort.html#comment-19236904) to yesterday's post while hunkered in another, actually, the _only_ air-conditioned room available.  So there's that.  Expect more when the air moves again.  

A couple quick confessions: 

*   The whole Freud thing devestates me.  I knew he was wrong, but until now I didn't think him a fraud.  That'll teach me to read people's letters or, you know, look past the face with which people countenance history.  [_Edited because one can't "delve beyond" a face.  See what the heat does to otherwise sound heads?_]
*   Google has abandoned me.  For some reason I lack the liquids to discover, Google will no longer index Acephalous.  I'm not sure what I did, but I think it has something to do with that search box I added the other day.  I did so because I found myself wanting to refer to things I'd previously written more and more and tired of having to do so the old-fashioned way.  That'll teach me to, you know, do things to make my life easier.
