## Nothing But Dog-Whistles, Dog-Whistles, and More Dog-Whistles

As happens fortnightly, I feel inspired to denigrate an Ann Althouse [post](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2008/03/why-are-letters-nig-on-childs-pajamas.html).  Many would read it, snigger, then take in the local nightlife.  To me, her stupidity is unignorable.  I witness it and cannot help but call shenanigans.  A nightmarish enigma who somehow finagled tenure from a respectable institution, Althouse considers herself the calm, reasonable voice of liberal feminism.  If someone wears a nightie within a square mile of Bill Clinton, her dulcet tones denounce the hussy with benign force.  She is not one to niggle with piddling arguments, so when she took her nightstick out this weekend—

—_Sorry_.  Can't do it.  Can't take it anymore.  

Am paralyzed by the stupid.

I hereby Knight you: He Whose Insight Ignites Sniggering.

[And I don't know anyone who actually considers Althouse either liberal or feminist except Republicans. Whatever that means.]

Hey: I heard that the Althouse site is _actually SEK's secret blog_ ...

Oh God, I first thought her article was [cutting satire](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Brasseye-Chris-Morris/dp/B000PC1MQO/ref=pd\_bbs\_2?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1204454984&sr=8-2), and then I read to the end. Weeps.

Let's score this in discovery-and-proof-of-stupidity points, in which the typical global warming lie exposed and demolished on Deltoid is worth ten points:

You discovered stupidity on the Internet: value 0  

You discovered stupidity from a rightwing blogger: value 0  

You discovered stupidity from a law professor: value 1  

Your demolishment involves use of neurology: value 1 

Sorry, only 2 points.

The funniest thing about Althouse is that she makes a riduculous throwaway gesture to point to some other something that she finds mock worthy, in this case the "RATS" controversy, that I somehow don't remember from the first time around, and then feels duty bound to defend it as an Absolutely Serious, Deeply Insightful and Carefully Thought Out post as soon as the comments start.  That was how I read the Jessica Valenti thing too: Althouse makes an off hand joke about Bill Clinton photographed with young women, then as soon as anyone questions it she's all, "But it's obvious! You're a blind liar if you can't see it!"

Oh, also the amazon autolink seems to have turned itself back on.

Huh.  I was wondering why it hadn't come up, but in Googling for it I found out that wiki has an entire page about controversies about the word "niggardly" ([here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies\_about\_the\_word\_%!n(MISSING)iggardly%!)(MISSING)).

[Geoff Nunberg](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1111423) had a nice piece on Fresh Air a few years back, about folk etymologies and the suggestive power that paricular sound associations have.  The piece took as its starting point the hoaxes/folk etymologies being circulated at the time that (incorrectly) located the origin of the term "picnic" in the history of American lynching.

_Man this is way better than anything posted on the secret blog._

Wait, I thought _this_ was the secret blog.  So confusing ...

_... an Absolutely Serious, Deeply Insightful and Carefully Thought Out post ..._

The resemblance is striking:

_It is a very serious, thoughtful, argument that has never been made in such detail or with such care._

Hold me, mother, I'm scared.

(Also, that link was [supposed to be there](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass\_Eye).)

I forgive you, but only because I had to look it up too.  Next time, um, actually, thanks for pointing it out like I asked, and be sure please to do so again in the future.
