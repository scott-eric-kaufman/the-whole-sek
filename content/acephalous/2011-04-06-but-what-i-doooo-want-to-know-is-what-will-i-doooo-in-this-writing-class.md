_SEK is substituting for his co-author/course director, so he when he walks into class, he doesn't know which students are supposed to be there and which aren't ... and there's one that certainly isn't.  SEK doesn't know that yet.  It is imperative for the reader to read said student's voice like this:_




 

_SEK walks to the Smart Podium and begins to open the images and videos he will be projecting on the wall during class.  MR. HELLO! approaches him._

**MR. HELLO!** HELLOOOO!  Will YOOOOU be doing the teaching of THIS writing class today?

**SEK:** I'm the sub.  I was told you were expecting me.

**OTHER STUDENTS:** We are.

**MR. HELLO!** I am not INNNN this writing class, I am considering adding a writing class to my portfolio this quarter.  May I add THIS writing class? 

**SEK:** I'm just the sub.  You'd need to ask the teacher.  

_SEK explains course policy about adding this deep into the quarter._  

**MR. HELLO!** But I am thinking of adding THIS writing course THIS quarter.

**SEK:** Even if I wanted to, I couldn't add you to this class this quarter, because I'm not the teacher.  I'm just the sub.

**MR. HELLO!** But what I DOOOO want to know is, what will I DOOOO in this writing class?

_SEK politely informs MR. HELLO! of what generally goes on in the composition department.  The other students—the ones actually enrolled in the class—begin to fidget._

**MR HELLO!** So what YOOOOU are telling me is that when I add THIS writing class, I will be DOOOOING writing.  How much writing will I be DOOOOING in THIS  writing class, counting by WORDS.

**OTHER STUDENTS:** At least two thousands words a week.

**MR HELLO!** So what YOOOOU are telling me is that when I add THIS writing class, I will be DOOOOING more writing than it is normal to DOOOO.

**SEK:** I can't add you to _this_ writing class, because I'm just the sub, and it's already a little too late in the quarter to add.

**MR HELLO!** So what YOOOOU are telling is that when I add THIS writing class, I will be—

**SEK:** I can't add you to _this_ class—

**MR HELLO!** But when you DOOOO—

_SEK checks the clock and sees that it's about a minute after class should've started._

**SEK:** I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you leave.

**MR HELLO!** So what YOOOOU are telling is me is that when I DOOOO return on Monday to add this class, YOOOOU will be adding me to it.

**SEK:** I'm just the sub, and I'm subbing for the course director, but I can assure you, she's not going to let you add this late in the quarter.

**MR HELLO!** But when I DOOOO see you on Monday, YOOOOU will—

**OTHER STUDENTS:** Enough already!  Just leave!

**MR HELLO!** (_addressing SEK_) I will be seeing YOOOOU on Monday.

**SEK:** Alright then, you do that.

_MR HELLO! leaves.  SEK stands in front of the class that isn't his with his mouth agape and his eyes agog._

**SEK:** I didn't get the best night of sleep last night, so I'm just wondering _did I just nod off or did that actually just happen_?

Note: In the interest of concision, I left out the part where he asked whether he could republish his course blog on the "WIDER internet" with ads so he could "at least make some money off THIS course."  I tried to explain that monetizing blogs is easy, but actually making money off them isn't, but -- _go figure_ -- he was having none of it, and informed me that he would be republishing his blog for "THIS course" on the "WIDER internet." 

Even though I was about half of that exchange, I honestly have no idea what actually happened.

Are you on the wider internet or the narrow one?

It depends on what that means ... and I have no idea what that means.

...And once again you prove you do not have a "normal" life.  You really should write a book!
