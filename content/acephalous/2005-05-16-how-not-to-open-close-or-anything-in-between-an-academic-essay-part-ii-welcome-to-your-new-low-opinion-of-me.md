## How Not to Open, Close or Anything In-Between an Academic Essay, Part II: Welcome to Your New Low Opinion of Me

When I published the first chronicle of  my undergraduate stupidities, I mentioned that
Seven months after completing my _magnum micturientem_ I
officially forswore Theory in an essay on the current state of Hawthorne
Studies.  Why I forswore there instead of forswearing somewhere else or
appropriate even escapes me.

A few readers have asked whether I would post that as well.  I wrote them back, insisting that it's nowhere near as amusing as my Honors Thesis.  I told them, "It's not funny, and because it more closely resembles my current positions, I'd be limited to mocking its tedious self-righteousness."  But they insisted.  

I played coy, saying "I don't think I have it anymore."  They insisted, correctly, that I lied.  

I feigned anger, shouting "I don't want to!"  They insisted, correctly, that I did.  

I hid under the covers, whispering "I see dead people."  They insisted, correctly, that I didn't.  

They wore me down.  I can no longer keep from them the oral presentation during which I renounced my idiotic, incoherent theoretical assumptions in favor of some sound ones.  (Unfortunately, I had yet to renounce the prose tics of the contemporary theorist.  Ugh.)  I warn you: this rant is most notable for its actual vs. assigned length, as oral presentations consisting of eight single-spaced pages aren't ever really "short."

Despite the insistence of some prominent (and some
not-so-prominent) literary critics on the value of criticism for criticism’s
sake, literary criticism ought to abhor a vacuum. If nothing else, literature ought to provide
the occasion for the critic’s labored prose and tangled syntax. Evidence of what I deem the proper mode of
literary criticism abounds in _The Scarlet Letter_’s critical canon. Neither superior nor subservient to Hawthorne’s romance, these
essays engage in an interactive dialogue with _The Scarlet Letter_ as a
work of literature. This may seem
simpleminded or wrongheaded of me: if you believe it the former, forgive me my
stupidity; if the latter, I welcome your new low opinion of me. This brief, highly directed reading of
critical history of _The Scarlet Letter_ demonstrates the proper role of
literature in literary studies, as an occasion for critical enterprise
(irrespective of the theoretical allegiances of the critic undertaking
it). Of course, this little polemic of
mine concerns only what falls under the aegis of literary criticism or literary
studies. Cultural studies, media
studies, intellectual histories and the like serve a purpose, but one distinct
from literary studies (if only by virtue of their primary object of
investigation). 

_The
Scarlet Letter_’s status as a canonical work of American literature assures
its treatment by each and every (earth-shatteringly significant but ultimately)
fleeting critical fancy. Determining
(or, I’m tempted to say, limiting) the focus of _The Scarlet Letter_’s
critical apparatus is then either frighteningly easy or impossibly
complex. In a reductive sense, the
criticism’s focus is on the narrative and the events that occur therein (what
we as undergraduates referred to as “the plot”). Regardless of their theoretical orientation,
all critics address the issues addressed (albeit, with varying degrees of
salience) by “the plot.” (The grossest
reduction necessary to sustain this reading is, obviously enough, the necessary
exclusion of “The Custom House” from its purview.) A more complex approach acknowledges the
determinative effects of a theoretical orientation on the generation of
significance in a literary work like _The Scarlet Letter_, meaning that in
each transitory critical moment critics are, in effect, reading a _Scarlet
Letter_ different from that of their predecessors. To prevent this polemic against the
theorizing of theory from falling prey to the logic it rejects, we need to
examine the critical apparatus that has grown up (though by no means
organically) around Hawthorne’s romance. 

However,
first we need to account for why such an apparatus would grow in the first
place. A “great” literary work would
not, according the working definition I’m developing, transcend the critic’s
mundane task so much as it merely (and you can read that “merely” as ironically
or unironically as is your wont) precedes it. Prior but not superior to the critical enterprise, a literary text like _The
Scarlet Letter_ occasions a mode of speculation categorically different from
the one engendered by, for example, a historical treatise on the effect of the
theological doctrine subtending Puritan legalism on the formation of “female”
as an autonomous subject position in Boston circa 1650. The question is not “what mode of
speculation?” or “which particular theoretical methodology?” _The Scarlet
Letter_ summons from the void so much as why one is summoned in the first
place. Scanning through the secondary
literature, one (note: not “the”) reason manifests itself: that old
undergraduate standby, “the plot.” As
long as we imprison the novel’s self-conscious symbolic order in the
terminological confines of “the plot,” this speculation (again, read as
ironically or unironically as is your wont) is not entirely invalid. However, its purview is so great, so broad
and simpleminded, that as speculations go, it is less than worthless. After all, every critical encounter with _The
Scarlet Letter_ addresses this definition of “the plot” in some respect,
however idiosyncratic. Intellectual
honesty demands it. We must then
question whether the text itself explicates some thing or idea (thereby
attributing its articulation to the Author), or whether we, in our capacity as
literary critics, explicate it. If the
text itself is doing the explicating (on its face, a patently absurd idea), how
is it communicating these ideas to the reader? How does it articulate what it means? But if the literary critic undertakes the explication of the text, by
what standards are we to judge that explication’s legitimacy? Intellectual history provides us with an easy
answer to that second question: the explications of literary critics are judged
(and just as often, their generation is over-determined) by the dominant mode
of criticism in a given historical moment. The answer to the first question eludes me, although it possible
existence seems less patently absurd now than it did a few sentences ago.

And so we
begin this paragraph where we began the last, attempting to justify the
centrality of literature to literary criticism. The majority (and I say “majority” to distinguish the conclusions of my
“comprehensive” two-week search from the potentially different conclusions an
“exhaustive” two-week search might reach. Were the two one-and-the-same, I’d venture to claim that the “entirety”)
of secondary material on _The Scarlet Letter_ presupposes the novel’s
importance, thus necessitating we distinguish between a great work of
literature and one which is merely important. To proclaim a work “great” implies an a-historical, transcendent
“greatness” inheres in the work itself, whereas proclaiming it “important”
merely indicates that a host of others have and do and will think it
“great.” Neither approach illuminates
much about the text itself, but at the very least, the idea of a work’s
importance (even if divorced from the conceptualization of its “greatness”)
provides an impetus for reading it. Otherwise, what reason is there for the voluminous amount of criticism
openly hostile to the work it addresses (or the opinions of the author as
inferred from that work)? If a work were
truly and inherently “great,” what reason could there possibly be to dislike
it? The easy answer to this is that some
people just don’t like “greatness.” But
if this answer doesn’t beg the question, I don’t know what does. How are we defining the quality of
“greatness” in a work? If the answer is
that someone or something assures of its “greatness,” we’d have to quantify
their criteria for “greatness,” and do we really think their non-answer will be
more quantifiable than ours? Probably
not, but despite the emptiness of the term, its circulation (both horizontally,
if you will, through a particular society in a particular historical moment,
and vertically, as it were, down through generations from its moment of
production to our own) assures us that we can validly consider it
“important.” From this, more questions
follow: what role does our consideration of a work’s importance play in
creating the illusion of its “greatness”? And if, metaphorically speaking, we as critics are speculators, what is
our gold standard? Do we even have one? Or are we no better than Peter
Goldwaite? (Goldwaite’s name becomes
more suggestive in this context: Goldwaite as “gold wait,” implying the
possible redemption of our paper bills; or is it Goldwaite as “gold wraithe,”
implying something about the abstract relation, as configured in this metaphor,
of a work’s “greatness” to its “importance.”) Cultural studies (at least in my caricature of it) impresses on us the
brilliance (quite the loaded term here) of the critical act as speculation: Who
needs a gold standard when such brilliant speculators abound? Who needs _The Scarlet Letter_ when we
can come to identical conclusions by reading the transcript of Ann Hutchinson’s
trial? Sadly enough, I’m no closer to an
answer now than when I began this paragraph; at most, I’ve established the
importance of _The Scarlet Letter_, and that functions as an adequate (though
by no means convincing) reason a re-reading of Hawthorne’s romance accompanies
the (monstrous?) birth of each new critical paradigm.

 But what
then are we to make of the fact that most of these re-readings still consider
the same thematic axial? From a
distance, there is uniformity to the situation I referred to earlier as being
“impossibly complex.” (No facile
allusion to chaos theory here; the distinction is analogous to the respective
perspectives of the private in the trenches and the binoculared general on a
distant hilltop. I know, I know, my
metaphor begs challenging. How,
precisely, did I acquire this perspective? To which I disingenuously reply, I have no conscious investment in any
particular methodology other than whichever one allows me to momentarily
repress my awareness of the illegitimacy of my metaphor.) I term this uniformity “a social history of
individual sin.” Critical paradigms
notwithstanding, the majority of the criticism contained in _The Scarlet
Letter_’s scholarly apparatus addresses the relation of an individual sin to
an individual sinner living under the strictures of the Puritan establishment.

A cursory
examination of the critical literature demonstrates the presence of this
thematic in the most disparate methodological approaches. In the cleverly titled “The New England
Sources of _The Scarlet Letter_” (AL 31:
257-72), published in 1959, Charles Ryskamp delivers a detailed explication of Hawthorne’s fastidious use
of historical sources. He characterizes Hawthorne’s historical
project as an attempt to imbue his fictional narrative with the authority of a
historical text. About Hawthorne’s
use of historical personages, Ryskamp claims “the fictional protagonists of the
action move and gain their being in part through their realistic meetings with
well-known people of colonial Boston.” Or, to rephrase this in the terminology I’ve
established, according to Ryskamp, Hawthorne situates his narrative within (what was, at the time, considered to be a
historically accurate) depiction of the Puritan social order to “support the
scenes of passion and punishment.” Here,
Ryskamp implicitly claims Hawthorne values the disjunction between the stern social order of the historical Puritan
establishment and Hester’s alternative moral order. I can hear Ryskamp’s valuation of the
historical as a higher order of narrativized reality than literary fiction when
he projects his own ideological leanings onto Hawthorne, who evinced a “steady
determination to make the romances of his imagination as real as the prison
house and the grave.” But how can a
fictional narrative compete with the materiality of the building? The implied answer is “through the
utilization of the historical record.” Ryskamp’s conception of the constitution of physical reality extends
farther than my contemporary one, encompassing not merely the building
historical events occurred in, but the events themselves. The one-to-one correspondence between the
historical reality of Puritan Boston and the severe social order in which Hawthorne situates his
narrative create a contrast that accentuates the thematic I have already
identified as being central to the secondary literature. (Were I more intellectually honest, I might
pause here and characterize my own critical methodology. I might historicize the critical move of
combing a text in search of ruptures, that moment where what I (pre-)conceive
as being the common strain in _The Scarlet Letter_’s secondary literature
bubbles to the surface of a critical essay with a markedly different
theoretical orientation and “betrays” this other author’s unconscious awareness
of the superiority of my critical enterprise. Of course, I would never articulate the purpose of my method so
directly, instead claiming that my awareness of these ruptures in this other
critic’s text is the result of my directed reading, because we’re all tired of
constantly having to kill our fathers, those benevolent figures we assist in
the reproduction of every time we read another always already obsolete
essay. Or, at the very least, we’re
tired of hearing about it. After all,
what kind of party pooper would harp about the blood on our hands when we’ve
recreated a brand new critical paradigm?)

Other
historical approaches, such as Joseph Schwartz’s “Three Aspects of Hawthorne’s Puritanism”
(NEQ, 36: 192-208), published in 1963, explicitly relate to my
directed/thematic reading of the secondary literature. Schwartz claims that “Hawthorne always felt that the religious
system of Puritanism was hard, cold, and confined; it was only the fervent
faith of firm believers that redeemed it at all.” Hawthorne’s
use of Puritanism thus created a tension between society and the exquisitely
complex emotional life of the individual. If we were to politicize that complexity, render its juxtaposition with
the Puritan social order in sectarian logic, we would find ourselves arguing
something similar to Michael J. Colacurcio’s argument in “Footsteps of Ann
Hutchinson: the Context of _The Scarlet Letter_” (ELH 39: Sept. 1972). In Colacurcio’s account, Hester’s individual
complexity implicates her sinful actions in the antinomian movement, because
“the extremes of public legalism seem to breed their antinomian opposite as if
by natural law,” thus making it impossible for Hester “to affirm the legitimacy
of her powerful sexual nature without also affirming total, anarchic spiritual
freedom” (of a sort anathema, if you’ll pardon my ecumenicalism, in the rigid
Puritan social order). 

The old and
new historicism both assume “a social history of individual sin” to be _The
Scarlet Letter_’s central thematic, and therefore use it to underpin their
entire critical enterprise. But in a
real way, the proper response to my essay so far should be a resounding (All
together now!) “Duh.” How could
historically inclined critics not presuppose the primacy of social history in
their accounts of _The Scarlet Letter_? How could they not contextualize Hawthorne’s
romance and still respect themselves in the morning? Nina Baym, in a review of 1968’s body of Hawthorne criticism,
praises Nina Bayn for doing precisely that. Nina Baym, in what Nina Baym characterizes to as “a fresh reading of
this much-read book,” is impressed by her own dehistoricization and
secularization of _The Scarlet Letter_’s context in “Passion and Authority
in _The Scarlet Letter_” (NEQ 43: 209-30). Nina Baym recounts Nina Baym’s argues that Dimmesdale and Hester “feel
guilt to the extent that they have internalized the prohibitions of their
community, and no absolute moral issues are implicated in their ‘sin.’” Baym’s dehistoricization of the Puritan
social order is not a unique move, but one with a long critical history. Prominent examples include, at least in
theory, psychoanalytic readings, but to be fair to Fredrick Crews, his _The
Sins of the Father_ doesn’t participate in this dismissal of history. However, Crews does that “if [he] were to say
in one sentence what _The Scarlet Letter_ was ‘about’ … [he] would call it
a study in the unconscious interdependence of people who feed off one another’s
incompleteness in a society which encourages them to dissemble and burn
themselves away in secret.” The movement
into a psychoanalytic critical apparatus poses some problems for the historicist. For example, how exactly do the neuroses and
psychoses of early 20
th
 century Austrians pertain to individuals in
17
th
 Puritan Boston? (Freud’s
universalization of his conceptual apparatus, first by projecting it back to
the origins of Western Civilization (_IoD_), then by implicating it in the
discourse of scientific objectivity (_BtPP_, _E&I_), does not
validate Crews approach. Full
disclosure: Then again, here I am talking about “ruptures” in the text.) Baym’s decontextualization seems the more
egregious of the two, because she replaces the framework of Puritan authority
with an a-historical, blandly generic society that is “repressive and
authoritarian in its nature, and condemns their act because of its passionate
and self-expressive essence.” (By comparison,
Kafka’s parables seem exemplars of literary realism.) 

Because
this is becoming increasingly unwieldy (_The Casebook II: This Time, It’s
Historical_), let me quickly return to the issue I was discussing at the
onset of this essay. That is, if the
central theme in _The Scarlet Letter_’s critical apparatus is the social
history of individual sin, why read _The Scarlet Letter_ at all? Why not analyze the transcripts of Ann
Hutchinson’s trial instead? Is it merely
because of the novel’s purported “importance”? Since I have the floor, I’ll fathom an answer: literature is synthetic,
and as such it engenders a mode of speculation of a category different from
that of the historical, political, or moral speculation. Thinking about the four offices of the scarlet
letter (historical, political, moral, aesthetic), we can imagine their
conflation as being representative of the literary text. Through this synthesis, the concrete is
rendered ambiguous, but to what end? To
be honest (that is, to resist polemics for the moment), it’s just more
fun. It’s more work, sure, but it’s
enjoyable work. I read about I.G.
Farben’s involvement with the Third Reich in history texts, but I didn’t enjoy
it. It was edifying alright, but not
productive of a sublime paranoia that dogged my heels for weeks. To be polemical again, we can gather two
sorts of information from this synthesis: 1) inferred information about the
author, and 2) information about the society in which such a synthesis would
occur. Of course, when the moment
depicted differs from the moment of production, we’re going to run into a
problem, unless we posit that the real issue is the author’s opinion on the
society in which such a synthesis would occur. The question then becomes, why would we value this particular human
being’s opinion so highly that we’d work to generate the kind of information we
could be spoon fed by a historical treatise? Is the answer that literature contains another kind of knowledge, that
one synthesis occurs, no one office can extricate itself from the mess without
retaining something of the others? Does
each infect/inflect the other?

OK, fine, I'll accept your incessant pimping of The Valve and read it /some/. You know, just a little bit. Doo dee doo doo doo... ooh, "articles on radical pedagogy," eh? I bet if I Google "radical pedagogy," I'll find something worth linking to in a comment on Scott's blog!

You're goddamn right I did. Would you describe that more as sickeningly self-absorbed, ludicrously self-important, or comically oblivious? I vote for the last one, but your opinion may differ.

I want you to promise that you'll shoot me like a dog if I ever even approach that level of asshattery.

Incidentally, Skippy McMetsfanface, how would you describe the reception of your no doubt painstakingly written paper? Bored and/or hungover looks accompanied by polite but completely insincere and indeed disinterested applause, or cheers, rapturous joy, and enthusiasm?

Yeah, I thought so. This is why I stay away from public speaking. My soul would be crushed on an all-too-frequent basis. 

Regards,  

David

P.S. Speaking of soul-crushing, did the beers help with Phase One of your retooling project? Are you feeling any better now, or is bitterness just starting to sink in?

Can I format or _can I format_?  The retoolin' has begun, but with no beers, tears, steers or queers.  (BTW: Everyone who reads this should send hearty congratulations out to Some Gay Guy who, yesterday, one the most prestigious dissertation fellowship around.)  Next year I will win it all!  Next year I will be the crusher of souls and you all will have your soul's crushed!

As for the reception of that essay, well, in the way that criticism of the academy from within the academy has about as much of an effect as pressure from without, when I looked up, a lot of people looked at me, asked some useless, irrelevant questions, and then started talking about something else.  

And Mr. Rodriguez and all of his being?  Who is he talking to?  Who are "you" and why do "you" care about what "you" embody to him and he to "you"?  If I think about this much longer I'm goin' to rant again, so it's back to London, Kipling and company...

Congrats, SGG! What's your dissertation's subject anyway?

As for you, SDJ, your claims of imminent recovery remind me of the immortal "ahem" thread. Good times! (Having said that, I'm pretty sure your team /is/ about 9 times better than the O's, so I'm really glad I won't have to face you again. Assuming I beat Oakland.)
