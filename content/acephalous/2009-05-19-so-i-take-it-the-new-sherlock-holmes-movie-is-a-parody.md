## So I take it the new Sherlock Holmes movie is a parody?

Because, I mean, _seriously_. Just _because_. I'm not [still off my blogging game](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/05/scott-mccloud-learns-to-follow-the-advice-he-would-later-dole-out.html) here, I don't think, because that's genuinely the very definition of someone getting something obscenely wrong, isn't it? (Unless, of course, it goes gloriously right.Â  Given [this](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1032755/), however, I don't see much chance of that happening.)

It's Wild, Wild, West with House as the lead. 

Actually, that would probably be better.

Yes, Steampunk hijinks in London. A shame they had to hang SH's name on it.

This is what I really don't get, why do people feel the need to come up with a movie idea, then slap it into some existing format? "Steampunk hijinks in London" would actually, I'm a little ashamed to admit, be pretty frickin cool and I'd be in for it. So why do we need to pretend it is Sherlock Holmes? I'm trying to come up with other examples, and I'm failing for now, but it seems like this happens a lot.   

And, yes, I do actually know why people feel the need to do it, money and marketing, but I can still be wicked annoyed, right?

Steampunk in London with Robert Downey Jr. That's going to be fun whatever it's called.

However, we shouldn't be too purist about our Sherlock Holmes. Arthur Conan Doyle was writing popular fiction - hell, he retconned the death of his protagonist because of public demand. Moriarty's air-rifles were pretty steam-punk on their own; Doyle wrote plenty of "action sequences." Furthermore, The Seven Percent Solution I think is evidence that you can really mess with the formula and end up with genius if you do it right.

 Heeey, RocknRolla was awesome. :P   

However, this must be a parody... right?

Ritchie is really at action sequences, hijinks and character fragments.  He's not so good at what you'd call "story."  Hopefully Downey will be able to keep the whole thing from going off the rails.

Also, apparently Staley Tucci is going by the name Mark Strong now.

I don't mind steampunk either, and I love most of the people involved. I'll probably see it before too long. I just always felt like Holmes was my kind of ideal person--patience, attendance to detail, given to thinking hard about things and interpreting--and it looks like that element might get tossed in favor of some cool imaginary 19th century technology.

 _Steampunk in London with Robert Downey Jr. That's going to be fun whatever it's called._
 __ 

_However, we shouldn't be too purist about our Sherlock Holmes. Arthur Conan Doyle was writing popular fiction - hell, he retconned the death of his protagonist because of public demand._

_I don't mind steampunk either, and I love most of the people involved._ 

The issue isn't the steampunk, or a non-purist adaptation of Sherlock Holmes. The issue is why? Why take a known, valued character, and completely change him to fit another story? You lose the value that using Sherlock Holmes brought in the first place, other than the name recognition that brings people to spend their money. 

To give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe they did set out to make something actually resembling Sherlock Holmes and somewhere along the lines it became vastly different. Wouldn't it have been more creatively liberating to go "screw it, let's do our own thing."

As it is, adaptations that are only in name don't usually bring anything new to the source and devalue the new material but tying it to a past it probably shouldn't be tied to any longer.

I'm still unable to remember examples of this that have bothered me in the past (and I know there are instances of a project starting off as an adaptation and becoming something seperate), but I'm sure I will wake up in the middle of the night and stumble to the computer and slap it down here.

Probably because someone wanted to do a Sherlock Holmes movie, and an exec said, yes, but we need some action/T&A to draw teens, so let's find a director who's British and does action! Hey, Guy Ritchie - want some money? Sure, but only if I can throw in some drugs and slow-mo! Awesome, let's have your people meet my people and do some blow!

I'm really looking forward to this film.

Well, [reviews of it](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/markkermode/2008/09/rocknrolla\_suicide.html).

"Creatively liberating"?  Honey, this is the movie business we're talking about.  Creativity has nothing to do with it.

ah, look at yourselves now, arguing like children, this movie shows exactly how i pictured him (or so it seems, haven't seen it) but since it isn't even out yet, we shouldn't be arguing, we should watch it first, perhaps it is like you think it should be and the trailer only shows the scenes it does to try and get a larger audience, so sit down and shut up

I have to disagree--they referred to nothing but the books in the process, and what's wrong with taking a new, fresh look at an old character? Watching carefully, one can see thousands of references to the books--and I was overjoyed to see Sherlock actually getting to use his (expressly stated in the books) mad fighting skills. In the books, he would retreat to his rooms and lay comatose for long periods of time, was addicted to cocaine, and was rather...eccentric in many ways. (his refusal of all women except Irene, his methods, his expansive and at the same time brilliant knowledge...to name a few) So the replaced cocaine with alcohol. Cocaine in HOlmes time was not illegal, just at it is not illegal to posses alcohol now. It was to make it easier for the public to relate, and make sure they knew he didn't do something illegal like illegal drugs.  

And, Watson was not a froof. He was his own person, which I enjoyed.   

yay!
