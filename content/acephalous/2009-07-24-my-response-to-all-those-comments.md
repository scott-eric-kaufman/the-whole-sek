. . . [is here](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/07/welcome-to-googles-postracial-america.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef0115713d98b1970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115713d98b1970c).  I would have posted it as a post, but I don't have time to revise it as I would like because I'm moving this weekend; yet I felt compelled to respond to it because it's on my blog, so I wrote a response and posted it sans revision.  

Forgive it its infelicities, for it knows not my red pen.

Civility is highly overrated. I repect where you come from, but you're wrong in your attempts to reach across the aisle to racism apologists like Patterico. As always with these incidents it's possible to pretend people are not arguing from racism, have other concerns that just coincidently happen to take the side of the white bully against the Black victim. You've been on the internet for a while, you know how those things go.

No, Patterico is not a KKK member or neonazi or whatever, but he is somebody who is willing to use racist imagery, to excuse white police brutality against Black victims. If you value his contributions to "the debate", you aresaying to everybody who is on the recieving of these actions that they don't matter enough.

I don't know if you paid attention to teh whole RaceFail debacle in online sf fandom earlier this year, but that wasone of the common themes; that being overly careful not to hurt the feelings of racists or people engaged in racism had the adverse effect on victims of racism, that being careful not to condemn white people for their racist actions froze out people of colour from huge parts of fandom, as they see that it's not safe for them to be there...

That's pitiful how willing you are to call people racist solely by what amounts to an administrative formula. That's icky and fascist I think.

happyfeet - That is the only arrow in their quiver.  Racist.

But holding that _civility is highly overrated_ is as invitey an invitation to robust racisms as I can imagine. No. Civility is a big big part of how racisms go buh-bye I think.

Yeah, the guy who called the President's wife "skeezy" and keeps trying to turn an instance of police overstepping their bounds into a second Ruby Ridge has any room to call anyone anything.  In addition to be a pathetic writer, penguin, you wear your outrage in particularly embarrassing ways.  Can't you tell us that Abner Louima deserved what he got

oh. You do not understand, Josh Lawrence. Amiri Baraka, former poet laureate of the blue blue blue blue blue blue state of New Jersey, says you're _opposed to_ address powerful black women as "skeeza." For [reals](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columns/gregory-kane/A-poet-and-the-Black-Power-movement-42891962.html). Josh Lawrence you need to get with the times I think.

you're not clicking through are you Josh Lawrence? I will help you. If you clicked you would have learned that it's a marxist honorific...

His audience of overwhelmingly black listeners went absolutely wild when Baraka called Rice a “skeeza,” cheering and applauding and whooping with glee.

You need to learn how to show a little respect to our first lady, Josh Lawrence.

Oh, I get it, you think they all look alike!  Now, the joke makes sense.

Do you ever practice having thought about politics unrelated to grievances or false equivalencies?  You are like Marc Levin on acid, all over the place with the "well, one time a Democrat or liberal did it, so I can do it to."

What a chip this little man has on his shoulder, where every offense toward his "conservative" ideology since Watts is stored and festered and then randomly bleated out through a rambling, punctuation-less that is so third grade, ee cummings himself would sooner self-immolate than read another comment.

I find myself feeling sorry for a bitter, middle-aged man living with so many perceived slights.
