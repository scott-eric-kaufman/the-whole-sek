What could I add to a spam-blog's complaint about the spam-mail it receives?

Absolutely nothing.  Behold [the inchoate mumblings](http://iworkwithpeople.wordpress.com/2007/06/01/hahaha-email-spams-and-scams/) of spam speaking to itself:
**HAHAHA Email spams and Scams**
                
                

Flipping through my trusted email "haha you have penetrated my spam filters. much kudos to you!"

**Subject: it's janet**
Do not ignore me please, I found your email somewhere and now decided to write you. Let me know if you do not mind. If you want I can send you some pictures of me.  I am a nice pretty girl. Don't reply to this email. Email me direclty at [djanet55@mailcreativity.info](mailto:djanet55@mailcreativity.info)

looks like this zimbabwa or what ever country  dude, wants to be a sexy girl.

anyone else get some funny crap? go ahead and copy and paste the crap here.. just not images or anything.

**added:**

If you do not realize that I have copied and pasted a scammy email
in that message, then you need evaluation. please do not scream at me
for that content, unless it is your email addy i posted.


Decades from now, you'll tell your grandchildren about this moment.  As they bow before the whips of their Spam-Lords, they'll curse you for your lack of foresight.  You could've stopped it.  You could've done more than press delete ... but you didn't.

You didn't.  Now your great-grandchildren have tremendous penises, constant erections, and breasts the size of Volvos.

This sounds like a strange sort of inverse Lamarckianism...

"...breasts the size of VW Beetles" would surely be more apt.

I have the suspicion that all the emails I send you vanish into some secret, abject, hidden folder, purged by the hypervigilent spam policebot on your machine.  So ... yes.  Spam.
