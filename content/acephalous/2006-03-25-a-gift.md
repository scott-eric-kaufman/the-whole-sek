Because you're special:  [a gift](http://acephalous.typepad.com/neko\_and\_her\_pornographic\_buddies.zip). 

[WARNING: The gift is large and contains pornography, er, pornograph_ers_.  New ones.  And a solo one too.]

Edited on 26 March 2006 at 11:02 AM to reflect Scott's discontent with his parody of Neko Case's "sledge of tectonic fever"-type lyricism on _Fox Confessor Brings the Flood._

As it happens, just got in right now, having seen the NPs (without Neko, though) play the last date of their current tour, supporting Belle and Sebastian.

A fine night.

I was fortunate to see the Pornographers in Seattle last November at the Pyramid Ale festival.  Neko as there.  It was glorious.  

Thanks for the gift!  I'm listening as I type this...

The file was huge, Scott.  Post a warning next time.

I second Jason.

Tease.

Tho I am quite happy with the music. :)

I downloaded it but couldn't open it.  I kept getting an error message.  Any suggestions?

I saw Neko Case open up for the Jayhawks a number of years ago -- what a show!

Gift or theft? What's our licensing status with regard to the copyright owner?

Dr. V., you should be able to unzip it with [Winrar](http://www.download.com/3000-2250-10007677.html).  Try that.  If it doesn't work, it may be corrupt.  If that's the case, I can rezip it and upload it again.

And to all of y'all who've seen The New Pornographers live: I would have too if I didn't live somewhere _every single f'in concert "sells out" only to have the tickets appear 10x face-value on ebay three minutes later_.

Yup, even with Winrar the files wouldn't open.  I got messages for each one saying they were corrupt.
