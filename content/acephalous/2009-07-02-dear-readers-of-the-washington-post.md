Not only am I someone "[who _says_ he has a PhD in English from the University of California at Irvine](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/shortstack/2009/07/conservative\_author\_jack\_cashi.html)" (emphasis mine), [I actually do](http://acephalous.typepad.com/files/dissertationabstract.gif)!Â  

On an unrelated note, I'm not sure whether the [Google Image results](http://images.google.com/images?q=site:acephalous.typepad.com+acephalous) for this blog are representative or insulting, but they certainly are _something_.

I think the fact that they've put "some guy on the internet" (Don't get me wrong: I know you, trust you, etc., but they didn't even bother to look up the UCI department pages to see if you were on the level!) on the same level as Cashill is probably going to drive him nuts when he notices it.

After I get tenure.

_I think the fact that they've put "some guy on the internet" (Don't get me wrong: I know you, trust you, etc., but they didn't even bother to look up the UCI department pages to see if you were on the level!) on the same level as Cashill is probably going to drive him nuts when he notices it._

1.  That's awesome.  I love ego-chopping idiots.

2.  If they did consult the UCI department pages, all they would've found are references to me having been a grad student and the talks/colloquiums I did.  There's no evidence I actually graduated, so maybe they did check but, in the end, had to take my word for it.

Well, maybe, but Proquest has your dissertation on file. I've sent you the screen-shot...

Those Google image results are cool.  Ah, yes, the caption competition!  Whatever happened to that?  Who won that so-called 'competition' anyway?  It was billed as 'The First Ever Acephalous Caption Competition'.  Where are the others?  Why did you let it die?  [_shakes head_] You've changed, man.  You've changed.  [_chugs beer_]

Hey, maybe if you got proof on paper - and hang it on a wall - and take a picture of it - and download it to your blog - then all will know you really finished and have proof.  I must say you have a frame, but it is empty.  So, get working on getting that little piece of paper that shows you are finished.
