The following is an email _The Acephalous Sun_ recently acquired: 
Dear SmartPodiums "Я" Us:

We here at the Instructional Resource Center would like you to modify the Model-T51789 SmartPodium previously installed in HIB 110.  The specific alterations we request are:

*   When an instructor presses the "up" button on podium touchscreen the cursor should move down and when "down" is pressed it should move up.  Similarly when the instructor presses "right" the cursor should move left and when "left" is pressed it should move right.
*   Every time an instructor touches the touchscreen it should emit a shrill "beep" to inform the students that their instructor has touched it.  If possible we would like it to randomly emit multiple beeps despite being touched only once.
*   That "beep" should not correllate to the cursor moving in the opposite of the desired direction.  The cursor should only move when it wants to.  But the SmartPodium should beep everytime the instructor touches it.  And sometimes when he doesn't.
*   We also request a camera with video capability be secreted in or next to the touchscreen.  It should be programmed to record whenever the touchscreen is activated.  Once completed the SmartPodium should automatically email the recorded video to the email addresses specified in previous correspondence.

We hope these modifications can be completed before 16 February 2006.  Thank you again for your willingness to go the extra mile for the IRC.  

P.S.  If you would like your email added to the aforementioned mailing list we'd be more than happy to oblige.  Watching these idiots cajole then threaten your quality podiums is all the meaning we can muster from our tiny  little lives.

It might be easier to turn the cursor upside down instead of re-flashing the driver for the aforementioned button changes.

"Turn the cursor upside down"?  How would I do that?  The cursor on the flatscreen before me moves like a cursor oughta.  The cursor on the big screen, however, doesn't.  I'm hip with flashing button changes.  After all, I've been known to play the occasional SNES game on this here laptop . . . but I don't see why I should have to do that on a SmartPodium.  

Shouldn't they assume their clients are computer-illiterate?  Even if they don't, you know, even if they assume they ain't savvy—which I am, _stop laughing_, I've kept two laptops and three desktops running smoothly for five years, and that's no small accomplishment—shouldn't they at least make these things user-friendly?  Isn't it their job to make these matters intuitive?  _Or at the very least not counter-intuitive_?  Not that I'm attacking you, brother, but seriously, I don't think IRC ought to program their "Smart"Podiums to work so . . . unsmartly, no?

In this post Microsoft era, people are praised for the user un-friendlyness.  The idea is that the designer is smarter than the user and must prove this fact.  Unfortunately, Steve Jobs is too stupid to figure this out, and Apple continues to put out intuitively operated devices.

I'm assuming you've never seen the SmartPodiums@ in the Computer Sciences Building... Evidently, the average instructor is 3'4" tall, and doesn't mind getting down on his knees.

And yet....

There is a ten-minute delay on the time it takes the classroom computer to go on "standby," so you get to sit in front of the class, much like Patton, with a projector light in your eyes and an enormous image of Jon Stewart behind you.  

Sigh... UCI....

I would have thought that an image of Steve Colbert or Mr. Know It All (see Bullwinkle) would be more poignant.

No, Guy, it's all about the Patton...

Also:

-When an instructor is operating the Model-T51789 SmartPodium, it is imperative that he or she not treat the projection screen as a weapon of mass destruction, e.g., beheading or impaling his or her superiors by lowering said screen upon them.

-Please note, and perhaps at this point this is solely for the intent of shits and giggles, the Model-T51789 SmartPodium may, at its own discretion, elect to open the auditorium door on the other side of the room by remote so that an instructor will have to cross the floor and, resembling the pose of a weightlifter or cartoon character attempting to lift an anvil, pull and pull and pull on the handle of the electrically operated door until it finally can shut.
