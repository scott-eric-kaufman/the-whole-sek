## Glenn Reynolds to Strangle Mullahs, Scientists with Own Hands; Amanda Marcotte and Readers of Pandagon Said to be Furious

Remember what you just read on that other blog?  No?  Today's your lucky day!  I'm writing about it too.  You see, there's just too much original content out there: too many people pushing this twee genre beyond the break; too many distinctive voices finding nooks and exposing crannies; too many sharp minds seeing past blogger bombast to something, I don't know, important.  It is therefore imperative, I say, _imperative_ that we all write about the same thing, and soon, lest we force our outrage to span the course of minutes.  

So let's talk about [Pandagon](http://pandagon.net).  It's a blog, written by some bloggers, one of whom committed political suicide _then_ joined the campaign of some Democratic contender.  Maybe I'm alone in this ([I'm not](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week\_2007\_02\_04.html#006234)), but as a sometime observer of American politics, I can say with certainty that openly criticizing religion leads nowhere people with money want to follow.  Simple as that.  Unfortunate?  Obviously.  True?  Don't you people watch television?  Or [read books](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140112405/diesekoschmar-20)?  Elections work by smear and smarm, smear and smarm.  (And the not infrequent toadying of minions.)  _Senators_ have a difficult time getting elected because they have to run on a record—why would a _blogger_ be any different?  Not in the electing, mind you, but in the having-of-a-record.   Records are _bad_.  They brim over with delicious ambiguities any toddler who's seen _Headline News_ knows will sink a campaign.

And yet.

Everywhere I see nothing but outrage (_**OUTRAGE!**_) over the entirely predictable firing-_cum_-resignation of Marcotte.  Now there's this statement by Glenn Reynolds, who is important.  Why?  Because.  Everybody says so.  So he is.  Today he said he would like to see the government of these United States assassinate scientists and religious leaders in countries which begin with "I" and end with awesome verbs.  ("I ran"?  What are you, stupid?  Everyone knows "I rock!")  To which I can only point to the proverbial prevailing winds and, well, gesture vigorously, since winds are notoriously sketchy in the whole seeing-with-eyes department.  I remember reading about winds in Herodotus, or maybe _The English Patient_, but who cares?  I'm angry.  

At the wind.

Because it's sketchy, and I'm a political blogger.  I see sketchiness everywhere.  The fact that it ain't all that sketchy—that it proclaims, with streamers, balloons, ticker-tape and trained baboons—this matters not to me.  I want to know who hired that baboon ... if those streamers were manufactured by people making a living wage ... whether that ticker-tape is twice or thrice recycled.  These details influence how I'll manifest my obligatory outrage.  "Did that baboon earn a living wage?" will hound me all through the night.  Visions of baboons whoring themselves on the streets of some Third World country will plague my dreams.  I awake with a fleeting commitment to animal rights, or the plight of sex workers, or _something_, and then I drink some coffee, have a smoke and light off for work.  

My outrage is portable.  

Portable?  I meant potable.

As in ...

Yes, either the parody or the cuteness are the only worthwhile responses.  I tried both.  Which do you like better?

Personally I think "smear and smarm" could be this year's "shock and awe".

Marcotte is and was a shrill potty-mouth. An anti-religious one at that. Since most posts at Pandagon are f\*\*\* this, that, or the other, I'm not real inclined to read it. She appears to have only one setting: Over The Top. While that may be nice red meat for the true believers, those who aren't true believers usually come away with one of two primary reactions: 1) Who whizzed in her Cherios? or 2) What a nut. [The irony of using the term "true believers" in reference to an anti-religious person was on purpose.] 

Supposedly, a political party is trying to pry loose some of these religious folk from their opponent. Ms. Marcotte was hired by a candidate of that party, and not only did not see the memo with the new Prime Objective, she disagreed with the Prime Objective and posted another of her patented "let's see how many Catholics we can offend today" posts after telling the candidate that she would play nice in the sandbox, and POOF, she's unemployed. At least from the candidate's campaign. When taking the job with the candidate, Pandagon became "satire" as she described it, but really now, who believes that? All of the folks giving the praise and "right on, sister" remarks in the comments? Well, probably not. 

And Adam has a point, moreso in political years (which I was hoping this one would not be, and all of the bullshit and bluster would be saved for 2008; however, that might exceed 2008's quota on BS, so maybe it is best to spread this to two years). Too bad that this is becoming one, except in Louisiana, where the state offices are in play this year anyway. 

At one of the links above it was asked about the possibility of the hiring of Charles Johnson of LGF as a blogger by a candidate on the right. I don't really think that would happen. Consultant? Perhaps. Day in and day out blogger? Probably not. The difference MIGHT BE that Charles Johnson KNOWS what he's written and KNOWS that some of it is unacceptable to Muslims. Marcotte and Edwards appear to either not be aware that her remarks at Pandagon are insulting to a large part of the population, or, using her vernacular, they didn't give a f\*\*\*. The former is out of touch with reality, the latter is an insensitivity that they would ABHOR if they found it on the right.

David,  

I'm not a big reader of Amanda's, but I advocate her right to say whatever the hell she wants.  I note, outside of Malkins ilk, the only people writing about this seem to be men.  It matters not to me if someone curses or is irreligious, nonreligious.  I don't need everyone to be just like me.  What I do not understand is this:  Why would you go off full-cocked about Amanda Marcotte yet have absofuckinglutely nothing to say about Glenn Reynolds advocation of terrorist tactics against another country?  And, here I thought we were supposedly fighting to abolish terrorism and its tactics.  Go figure.  What is it that apparently makes it wrong to espouse Amanda's views but not those of Reynolds?  To me, its like the provenicality of the U.S. populations view about sex and nakedness equating to BAD and random acts of violence equals GOOD.

David -

It bears mentioning that Amanda isn't Pandagon's only poster (never was), and that her posts - though 'intemperate' by whatever standard we're supposed to be using this week - were generally a good deal less tiresome than her co-blogger Pam's. If you see the word 'Chimperor' it's the latter's work. Amanda can hold whatever questionable positions she wants; by and large you can at least still argue with her about them, which is something.

Let's see, I spent more time on the Amanda and the Pandagon thing because you did the same in your post, too? 

First paragraph: Introduction. 

Second: Amanda/Pandagon!

Third: Amanda/Reynolds!

Fourth: Your statement of important issues to you. 

She rates appearance in two of four main paragraphs and Reynolds in only one, so what am I to think your main point is? Perhaps your fourth main paragraph or possibly Amanda. Reynolds appears to be but a rhetorical juxtaposition of how unfair this all is to Amanda because he did not get called on the carpet for his remarks, while she did. As a former boss of mine said, "Forget the f-word [fair], life ain't fair."  

Still looks TO ME like she's your main subject. So that's what I commented on. Surprised? I don't know why you are. 

And sure, she has a right to say what she wants, and I have the right to be thoroughly disgusted with it, don't I? You attract more bees with honey than with vinegar, and all I find there on Pandagon is vinegar. 

I actually find this quite ironic that you seem to believe that I should let Amanda's outrageous stuff go without outrage under the guise of freedom of speech, but what Reynolds says I'm supposed to go apoplectic over, his freedom of speech be damned.

Oh drat. Mr. Banks got in before I finished the first comment. My timing sux. 

I know that Amanda has co-bloggers and always has had. She was the junior partner and not the headliner for some time. Ezra Klein and Jesse Taylor (I think those were the names) were there before she came on board. Every now and then I would go over there just to see what was going on in that part of the Internets. Kind of like every now and then I come over here. I don't really know why she has this thing about the Catholic Church or Christians in general, but a lot more atheists on the net (and she claims to be one) are able to disagree with Christianity and the Catholic Church in much more civil tones than ever came from Amanda's keyboard. She comes across to me as more of a crank than a critic. And I find it hard to pay attention to those, except when they deliberately (or circumstantially) draw attention to themselves. 

I do know that she also has a problem with the "innocent until proven guilty" concept in the court system. This is particularly evident in regard to the Duke 3, whom she continues to call rapists, the lack of DNA evidence notwithstanding. The tone that I pick up is just short of misanthropic, if not outright misandry. It appears that her first question to every man is "have you stopped beating your wife/girlfriend/significant other?" Of course, no woman has ever framed a man up with charges of rape. Never. (Yeah, right.)
