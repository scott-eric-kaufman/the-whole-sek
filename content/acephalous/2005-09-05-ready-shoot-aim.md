## Ready, Shoot, Aim!

Would that I had the gall to rename this blog that.  [![Clarke](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/clarke.jpg "Clarke")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/clarke.jpg) So I'm off to "NorCal" in the morning.  (I've been told that if I want to fit in I need to call it "NorCal," but since SoCal's abbreviated "SoCal," I'm not sure if I've been had or not.  Probably.)  I fully intend on enjoying this vacation.  I'll be re-reading Michael Lewis' (of _[Moneyball] (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393324818/sixapart-20 )_fame) account of his years at Salomon Brothers, _[Liar's Poker](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140143459/sixapart-20)_, and following it up by being the last boy on the block to read _[Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrrell](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1582346038/sixapart-20)_.  (And yes, I'll also be re-reading _Moneyball_, because it's the best popular book about the numerous attempts to quantify human behavior and develop sophisticated predicative models based on said quantifications...and it's about the Oakland A's, who I may have an opportunity to see while I'm in "NorCal.")

One thing I won't be doing is visitng [Jack London Square](http://www.jacklondonsquare.com/).  "Outstanding Shopping, Dining, and Entertainment"?  _In Jack London Square?  [![London0310](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/london0310.jpg "London0310")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/london0310.jpg)_Soapboxes topped by socialists I'd understand.  Spencerians screaming "progress, Progress, PROGRESS" wouldn't surprise.  But "Outstanding Shopping, Dining, and Entertainment"?  No thank you.  [Jack London State Historic Park](http://www.parks.sonoma.net/JLPark.html), to the contrary, looks to embody his own contradictions instead of those of modern consumer capitalism.  I find that more palatable and fully attend on visiting the charred remains of Wolf House (pictured on your immediate left).  I may also visit the boulder under which he insisted he be buried.  Such somber processions I can stomach at times like these.  Visiting the birthplace of the Dead, on the other hand, turns it.  

I'll address many issues (and answer many questions) upon my return.  But don't think that I won't be updating this here blog in every WiFi outfitted coffee shop from Irvine to Napa Valley.  Because I will be.  (And with all that time to think I'll answer intelligently many an important question, including the one asked by Cam, which if I weren't packing and/or avoiding thinking unpleasant thoughts about quarters beginning or Louisiana, I'd address immediately.)

Enjoy Clarke's first novel. It's good. I am happy to own a copy. I confess it is slow going at times.

And today was the first day I really dove into Hurricane Katrina coverage. At the risk of insenstivity, the best turn of phrase I can summon about this is ...  it's been a tragic farce.

\*Surely\*, even in American political circles, this must mean that heads will roll? Bush has to take responsiblity for this clusterf\*ck, right? Resign? Be impeached? . ..

Shrike, 

As a conservative Canadian, you must realize that, in America, you belong to the loony left, like myself and all other people who want to indict numerous administration officials for criminal negligence.  As a lawyer, you should be able to tell us: is "Brownie" so imcompetent as to be criminally liable for the deaths in New Orleans?  (Even if only in Canada?)  After learning about [all of this incredibly infuriating information](http://rhosgobel.blogspot.com/2005/09/historical-comparison.html), and then about, say, the fact that Bush and First Lady Laura both 1) made starving refugees _wait to eat_ until they arrived to feed them--"Sorry, you can't eat yet, this is _special food_, only the President or First Lady can hand it to you"--and then 2) dismantling these photo op. "shelters" the minute POTUS or his wife left, I want to scream emotions I don't even have the words to express.  These #$!%!((MISSING)$%!!(MISSING)$ left starving people waiting for food because their photo op. finished!?!

It's deplorable. And you can beat I'll be following all the legal angles of this story. Frankly, all I know is that if, say, a large earthquake and tsunami had hit the Lower Mainland of BC, and we had similar incompetence and malfeasance from our elected officials, they would be out of office using that wonderful feature of parliamentary democracy, the no-confidence vote. I just wonder if any American politician has the guts to try to hold Bush accountable. Senator Landrieu threatening to punch him on national TV was a good start.

(And by no means am I a conservative, even by Canadian standards. That makes me a stark raving socialist by American standards, even though I share some ideas with libertarians about economic policy.)

Bush at this point can't even save face properly.  I.e., what was up with him rambling on about the "good times" (no doubt snorting coke off some hooker's ass) he had in New Orleans as a youth in his press conference after touring the region?  Does he really think that this "good ol' boy" routine is going to mollify the disaster victims?

It's been pretty amazing to see many sycophantic reporters from the American corporate media (on Fox News! CNN!), and a lot of reliable conservatives, visibly shake themselves awake and realize that the emperor has no clothes. 

Of course, a lot of Canadians (like me) simply shakes their heads and ask: "What took you so long?"
