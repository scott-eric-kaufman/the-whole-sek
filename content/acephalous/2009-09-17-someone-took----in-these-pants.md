The news that Pavement is [reuniting and touring next year](http://www.matadorrecords.com/matablog/2009/09/17/pavement-coming-to-a-town-near-you-if-you-live-near-a-big-town-in-2010/) is not unwelcome, but it is a harbinger of impending senescence of your host, who vividly remembers listening to the widely distributed pre-release tape of _Slanted and Enchanted_ in early 1992 and pining over the absence of culture and spies in his quiet suburban neighborhood.   He would say, as irate futurists do of flying cars, "Where are my forty million daggers?  I was promised forty million daggers!"  

Pavement were the second or third most important band of his youth, behind only the Replacements and R.E.M., both of whom he discovered in the "R" section of a _Rolling Stone_ album guide that he browsed at the local library after he had been gifted his first "jam box" in fourth grade.  Understand: he did not want to waste his allowance on albums of insufficient quality, so he decided to research music and selected R.E.M.'s _Murmur_ and the Replacements' _Let It Be_ because both were awarded five stars and therefore guaranteed to be of the highest quality.  

Tickets for the September 18, 2010 show go on sale _tomorrow_ and interest among aging hipsters who traded their indie cred in for a lectern is expected to be high.

(As to the title of this post, below the fold can be found the obligatory YouTube of an Ouzo-soaked Alexander the Great being born from a box after having been struck by an automobile.)
