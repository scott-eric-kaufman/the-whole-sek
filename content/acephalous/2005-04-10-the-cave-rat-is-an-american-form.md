## The Cave-rat is an American Form

Were I to rename this corner of the internet, I'd undoubtedly name it "The Eye of the Tucotuco."Â  The name resonates, as does the sentence which would float below it in the unlikely event of a rechristening:
He does not know the eye of the Tucotuco was carefully dissected.

That's from Darwin's letter to Lyell, 3 October 1860.

It gives me pleasure to report the sequel to that:  

DAL 9000 v2: (Awww. You didn't even /giggle/, Sarah-child?)  

SayahPiper: I might have.  But I /am/ trying to preserve my dignity.  

DAL 9000 v2: You have dignity?  

DAL 9000 v2: I disbelieve.  

SayahPiper: Bapsch.
