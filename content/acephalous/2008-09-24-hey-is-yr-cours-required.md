			im in yor thurs class (9 am) and thats earlier so y is it this class is requirment?  hears how i see it: im lookin to start my own detailin bizness and i already know how to order parts n shit its not they asks for formal invititations for 23 inches u make sur they get paid and thats it.  like i told [my boy](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/sample\_student\_.html) [the other day](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/02/yo-dawg-we-is-u.html) 

This is the first generation of college students for whom familiarity with alternative modes of literacy may be essential to their success in the marketplace of ideas.  While the conventional definition of literacy still holds sway among educators and the old business elite, digital literacy—the very modes of communication disdained by the current arbiters of professional decorum—will confer upon the next generation of business executives a competitive advantage their forebears cannot even imagine.

so yeah like i said it may be competitionly to my advantages to focus maybe on digital thoughts instead a stringing words one after another to impres the likes of u?  i mean do u even care about yr rims.  whut u drive yo?

I was hoping that "my boy" would link to "we is underscrewed." Not quite as directly relevant, but still one of my all-time favorites.

Never let it be said that I don't take requests.  Your link, my good sir.
