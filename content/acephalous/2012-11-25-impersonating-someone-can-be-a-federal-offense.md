_SEK is inside his apartment being forced (by proximity) to listen [to children playing basketball on the court adjacent to his porch](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/i-hate-children-they-ruin-everything)._

exits his apartment and looks at his porch. On the ground is a shattered

**CHILD #2:** I'M RAY ALLEN!
