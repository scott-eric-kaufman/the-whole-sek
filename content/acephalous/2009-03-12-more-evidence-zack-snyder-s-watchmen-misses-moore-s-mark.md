## More evidence Zack Snyder's <em>Watchmen</em> misses Moore's mark.

Hunting around for an item required to address the comments on [the previous post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/03/dr-manhattan-as-a-figure-of-reader-of-alan-moores-watchmen.html), I came across a still from _Watchmen_'s credit sequence:

[![Batman](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01127964bc1328a4-320wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01127964bc1328a4-pi)

As Meredith Woerner [writes](http://io9.com/5167732/easter-eggs-and-missing-parts-in-watchmens-titles):

The opening shot, with Nite Owl giving a fist full of justice[,] has a big
Batman reference.  First, check out the posters to the right.  Look
familiar?  And isn't that Mr. and Mrs. Wayne at the back entrance of the
opera, being saved from a bloody death?  And . . . the opera bills say: "Die Fledermaus" (The Bat).  So can we
safely come to the conclusion that the original Nite Owl stopped Batman
from popping up in their universe?  


No.  If we could, there wouldn't be a poster for a comic book? film? play? radio serial? starring Batman in the background.  There is Batman-themed entertainment in this universe.  (
And if the opera being exited by the Waynes is 
_Die Fledermaus_
, Snyder alludes not to Batman lore but 
_Batman Begins_
.
  [Scratch that](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/03/more-evidence-zack-snyders-watchmen-misses-moores-mark.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef011168f08392970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef011168f08392970c).  The opera in _Batman Begins_ is _Mefistofele._)  The larger problem with this scene neatly encapsulates the larger problem with Snyder's aesthetic.  He is faithful in act but not in spirit.  His heart sins.  In _Watching the Watchmen_, Dave Gibbons says outright what every careful reader of the novel already knew:

I mentioned to [Alan Moore] the idea of pirate comics, reasoning that a world with real superheroes would have no need of them in comics.  Alan later took that throwaway idea and constructed an entire allegorical narrative from it within the main story.   


So why did Snyder include an advertisement for some sort of Bat-themed entertainment in the credit sequence?  _Because_ _it would be cool_.  Who cares if it violates the fundamental narrative logic of the work Snyder purports to love?

Wait, never mind.  I can't really make out the posters, assumed you were talking about the opera depicted.  Sorry.

Don't you "wait, never mind" me when you're correct.  Shows you how much I know about opera.

I think that's a bit strong, SEK. A tiny, background detail of an opera indicates sinning in his heart? I think it's a rather clever detail.

So what you're saying is, a movie failed to live up to the book? Wow, that is unusual. I'd devote two or three more blog posts to that one.

And take these in the context of the [credit sequence](http://www.businessinsider.com/watchmen-opening-credits-are-on-the-internet-forever-now-clip-2009-3) as a whole -- structured as a series of giant unmissable references. The bat-details here are microscopic in comparison, for fanboys and makars only.

I suppose I take it just another brick in the wall of Snyder's over-literal fanboy obsessiveness.  Says nothing in itself, but added to the evidence presented in the other post, it becomes significant.  Another way to say this would be:

Yes, it's clever, but it's _only_ clever.

Don't mind me, I was suddenly overcome with doubt that I could have caught SEK in such a basic error.

"I mentioned ... the idea of pirate comics, reasoning that a world with real superheroes would have no need of them in comics."

I'm trying to get my head around the logic of this.  As it might be: '... a world with _real_ wars would have no use for war comics'; or 'a world with _real_ weedy men and pneumatic women living in it would have no use for Robert Crumb.'

Don't ask me to explain your countrymen to you, Adam, as it seems they love something called "brisket."

According to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisket), it's especially popular 'in the Southern States of the USA'.  And with that, the pingpongball comes hurtling back _at_ you, over the net.

Hey, Other Josh:  he's talking about "brisket," which is a fixture of barbecues as well as of Jewish cuisine.  Not bris kit, an exclusively Jewish tool which a mohel carries with him.

Except that Hollis Mason establishes (in _Under the Hood_) that he'd read a Superman comic, so we know that superhero comics did exist at some point in the _Watchmen_ continuity. The first issue of _Bat-Man_ came out in 1939; the pirate comics essay at the end of Chapter 5 says that pirate stories didn't come to dominate the medium until the end of the 1950s. That gives a two-decade range during which that opening shot could be set, and if it's the opening shot, that implies it comes early.
