In "Presentism," Graham Good argues that 
Francis Fukuyama's brilliant Hegelian work called _The End of History_ was dismissed unread by most theorists despite (or because of) its offer of a coherent and persuasive vision of where we are in human history.  If any further justification were needed for the dismissal, it was provided by the news that Fukuyama worked fro the U.S. State Department.  So why bother with study, argument or disproof? (288).

For reasons unclear to me then--and still murky to me now--I didn't buy it.  I'd seen too many serious engagements with Fukuyama's argument for Good's claim to be true.  So I did some fact-checking of the cursory but thorough sort beloved by bloggers everywhere.  Here are the results:

A general search of JSTOR reveals 653 citations of Fukuyama's _The End of History_.  Limit the database to "Language & Literature," and you're left with 57.  "Not bad!" you yell?  (Self-congratulation is _so_ becoming.)  Considering that the "Language & Literature" is one of the four largest sub-groups in the database (63 journals to History's 57, Business' 59 and Economics' 40), that means the vast majority of citations of Fukuyama appear in other fields.  So how seriously have the folks who study "Language & Literature" taken one of the most influential theories--ideological inclinations notwithstanding--of the past 15 years?  Well, they're not doing too well in terms of pure numbers.  But maybe the literary scholars who take the time to challenge his argument do so seriously.  A quick tour:
