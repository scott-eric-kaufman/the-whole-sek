Is it just me or does that shade of blue burn your eyes?

Is that wishful thining or for reals? If the latter, congratulations!

It's adjunct work at UCI, but a paycheck's a paycheck.  (And for adjunct work, it's not half bad.  I'll be making twice as much as I did when I will have been a grad student here, but I'll only be teaching two more courses than I ever have, so plenty of time for editing, working on my applications and revising and resubmitting the articles all the flagship journals will desperately want me to revise and resubmit.)

The blue on Jeopardy is pretty eye-burning, too.

Congrats!

Wow, this is like a living illustration of what Bousquet has been writing about at the Valve.

"It's adjunct work at UCI, but a paycheck's a paycheck."

Yay for getting a Ph.D. so you can do temp work.

" (And for adjunct work, it's not half bad. I'll be making twice as much as I did when I will have been a grad student here,"

They'll be paying you -- $20K/ year?  $26K / year?

"I'll only be teaching two more courses than I ever have,"

For, effectively, full-time work?

What a deal -- how can I get into the lucrative field of literary studies?

Don't get me wrong, my first full-time job for a nonprofit was much the same, although there wasn't a class of more-stable workers over me.  But there, I could at least go freelance after a while, which moved me from salaried work to theoretically-less-stable hourly work but doubled or tripled what I made.  You have to hope for tenure.  No, not hope.  Kneel before Zod for tenure.

Oh, and congratulations!

Congrats! Re: Rich's comment, I prefer to stick my head in the sand and think like Rocky I: you can't win, so the triumph is going the distance and staying off the mat.

Later, one will be able to win the Cold War for America. But for now, watch Apollo Creed's left.

_wanna finish my dissertation for me?_

Soon as I'm done with mine, I'll be all over it.  Will your committee mind if it's about 19th Century evolutionary theory?

_Yay for getting a Ph.D. so you can do temp work._

Well, since 99 percent of hires happen between December and April, this isn't half bad.  I get what you're saying, but my brother had to do something similar when he graduated with a degree in electrical engineering.  All professions have their hiring seasons.  (It's just that, in most of them, people are actually, you know, _hired_.)

_They'll be paying you -- $20K/ year? $26K / year?_

A little more than that, when it's all said and done.  Given my extravagant lifestyle and many children, I'm sure I'll be able to manage.  Having this in my pocket also allows me to take the summer off, which is a boon considering how much work my chapters will need if I'm to get them published anywhere.

_For, effectively, full-time work?_

Two classes per quarter hardly qualifies as "full-time."  Yes, it's what professors at elite institutions teach at a much, much higher salary ... but they're ostensibly researching in their spare time.  I'll actually be.

_So . . . what classes will you be teaching?_ 

Two truly exceptional composition classes.  That sounded sarcastic.  It isn't.  The comp directors hired since I last taught it have created some amazingly flexible classes -- like the one my wife taught last quarter on the rhetoric of heroism.  I could conceivably teach a course on the rhetoric of science and teach, say, whatever novels I happen to be working on alongside excerpts from Darwin and what-not.  The philosophy, as I understand it, is that teachers are more effective when teaching material that matters to them.  While that's certainly not _always_ the case, it makes for a damn fine experience for me.

_November, huh?_

November what, Jason?

_Does this put you below or above Instapundit in the value rankings?_

Still well, well below.  Unless the value in question is ¡AWESOMENESS!, but I've _always_ had a leg up on him there.

_Later, one will be able to win the Cold War for America. But for now, watch Apollo Creed's left._

I'll be watching it all in the eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeye of the tiger.

_i'll let you know when i'll get my visa extended ;)_

For some reason, I didn't realize you were stateside.  ("Some reason" = "something Emerson said," probably.)

Never you mind, Jason, I see which November now.  The quarter starts earlier, but we receive our first pay checks on November first, and while I may be _employed_, I won't consider it gainful until I bank some green.

Ah, that's too bad. Because I had a [really good lead](http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/adswithoutproducts/April2008/photo?authkey=C3Y7lzFpb-w#5195549572866006802) for you... If anyone else wants a go, and is comfortable with the terms, don't hesitate to write...
