## The Cultural Logic of Brad Pitt, or Does Tyler Durden Reify or Challenge Hegemonic Codes of Race, Class, Gender, and Regional or National Identity?

The [Conscientious Objector](http://objector.typepad.com/objections/) has had flattered me not [once](http://objector.typepad.com/objections/2005/05/whats\_wrong\_wit.html) but [twice](http://objector.typepad.com/objections/2005/05/whats\_wrong\_wit\_1.html) in two days for not doing precisely what I'm about to do: mention a potentially interesting topic but have nothing insightful or entertaining to say about it.  Part of me understands the value of studying popular culture and, to be a little more forceful, the need for analyzing forms of cultural production that influence contemporary society in addition to [all](http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/janeinfo.html) [the](http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/London/) [ones](http://geoffreychaucer.org/) [that](http://www.pynchon.pomona.edu/) [don't](http://www.helsinki.fi/kasv/nokol/dickens.html).  But the rest of me bristles at the knowledge that approx. seven months from now a couple of English professors will stand before their peers and discuss whether Brad Pitt's characters "really explore radical or marginal locations outside the boundaries of the dominant culture, or are they only pseudo-revolutionaries-posing-as-rebels, but ultimately conforming to privileged, white, male, heterosexual, and American cultural norms?"  (The entire CFP can be found below the fold.)  I'm as interested in "Brad Pitt's postmodern subjectivity" as anybody else, but are English professors to determine whether Brad Pitt's performances "explore new postmodern constructions of race, class, gender, and national identity?"  But shouldn't this fall to Film Studies?  If I sound like I'm [repeating myself](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/an\_undisciplined\_discipline/), well, I'm _nuancing_ some of what I addressed earlier.  I'm thinking more about the medium than the methodology now.  And those are different issues.  Maybe.

I honestly believe in the social utility of studying popular culture.  I only question whether English professors are the ones who ought to be doing it.  That said, I can think of hundreds of reasons why English professors would be better suited to such analysis than anyone else in academia.  Had I not [cleaning galore](http://www.zerowaste.co.nz/assets/img/Howcanwehelp/PhotoGallery/landfill.jpg) to accomplish in the few short hours before Mrs. A. Cephalous returns from her [pilgrimage](http://www.stanford.edu/group/areaone/clross/images/quarter4/chaucer\_page.gif) to Kalamazoo, I'd compose a fully annotated list of every last one of 'em.  For now all I can say is that because no one discipline is really equipped to study popular culture, when the chips are counted English departments have as much purchase to the claim as anyone else.  Possibly even more.  I only wish they could find some way to do it that didn't make us all look like jackasses.

CFP: The Cultural Logic of Brad Pitt

For the 2005 Western Literature Association Conference in Los Angeles, we plan to organize a panel on the film icon, Brad Pitt. Why Brad Pitt?

As one of this generation's most popular actors, Pitt has explored many of the cultural tensions of our emerging postmodern era. Depicting masculine American whiteness in various states of crisis, his characters generally enact complex postmodern agencies; they are never wholly coherent, they are often self-destructive, and they generally rely on a certain amount of play--between stability and instability, between life and death, between autonomy and alter-dependency, between control and abandon. Simultaneously reifying and challenging hegemonic codes of race, class, gender, and regional or national identity, his characters explore the complex and changing postmodern cultural landscape. Tracing his performances through a variety of films and theoretical texts we hope to explain Brad Pitt's multi-dimensional postmodernity by exploring: 1) the cultural logic of his performances, showing how they dramatize postmodern cultural tensions, and 2) the kind of cultural or political work that his performances accomplish, or the difference that they make and the impact that they have on the audiences who watch them.

Some of the kinds of issues that we hope to explore include:

\* Brad Pitt's West: From A River Runs Through It and Legends of the Fall to Thelma and Louise and Kalifornia, many of Pitt's performances explore the physical and cultural landscapes of the American West? How do Pitt's performances both reenact and revise more traditional western narratives and identities?

\* Brad Pitt's postmodern subjectivity: How do Pitt's performances, especially in films such as Fight Club and 12 Monkeys, explore new postmodern constructions of race, class, gender, and national identity?  What makes these characters compelling or illuminating for contemporary audiences, and what do they tell us about how American culture is changing in response to new postmodern economic and historical contexts?

\* Marketing Brad Pitt: While Brad Pitt has clearly emerged as a mainstream Hollywood star and box-office favorite, his characters frequently bristle with an undeniably rebellious and countercultural energy? But do his characters really explore radical or marginal locations outside the boundaries of the dominant culture, or are they only pseudo-revolutionaries-posing as rebels, but ultimately conforming to privileged, white, male, heterosexual, and American cultural norms? What do his performances teach us about the complex relationship between the culture and the countercultures of the postmodern, especially in the popular media? How is his revolutionary persona used as a marketing device to sell movies and/or postmodern culture?

This cfp annoyed me too.  More generally, have you noticed how roughly 75%!o(MISSING)f the cfps that come up concern some totally bullshitty topic?  Is it just the academic nut-jobs who write these things?  Do the non-nut-jobs team up for panels on their own, because they're afraid of the nut-job proposals they'd receive if they posted on the cfp list serve?  I wish our mutual advisor would put us in contact with those other non-nut-jobs.

Greeeeaaaaaaat.  Now I've given myself a reputation as a "blog critic."  That's even lower than "blogger"!

On topic?  Uh....  How about we just outsource culture studies to the guys who can write [this](http://fametracker.com/fame\_audit/shatner\_william.shtml)?

Seriously, just how [big](http://www.steve-p.org/wm/mans.jpg) can they get the straw men in that panel description? 

Even if I saw that panel at the SCMS (Society for Cinema & Media Studies) Conference--where it might arguably more belong--I would avoid it like a trip to the dentist. Sadly, it's possible that individual papers submitted to that panel may be quite good, but the "logic" of the panel itself and how the terms of inquiry are laid out are very much what I am trying to avoid in my scholarship.
