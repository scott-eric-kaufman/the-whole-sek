I need some quick data about the geographical distribution of my readers.  If y'all could take a minute to sign up with [Frappr!](http://www.frappr.com/acephalous/) and add yourself to the [Acephalous group](http://www.frappr.com/acephalous), I'd appreciate it.  Much obliged. 

As for the rest . . . consider this an open thread.  Talk about . . . whatever.  I'm interested in what _you_ have to say.

[_Edit III: If you added me as a friend, please go back and add yourself to [my group](http://www.frappr.com/acephalous).  I had, in fact, created a group.  Seems like it just took a day to show up._]

I know what you want me to say.  But I'm not going to do it.  I have respect!  I have dignity!  I will not go gentle into that dark containment car!

I was then taken east, in a cage. I was taken to Toronto. Then Philadelphia. And then to New York. And each time I arrived at another city, somehow the white men had moved all their people there ahead of me. Each new city contained the same white people as the last, and I could not understand how a whole city of people could be moved so quickly.

Thy wine doth purify the golden honey; thy perfume,  

Which thou dost scatter on every little   

blade of grass that springs,  

revives the milked cow SHIT!

(_stubs toes, drops glasses, stumbles as he searches for them_)

Thief.  (_Blake and Farmer scramble on the floor.  Cow #2 moves her left.  Blake grabs his gun and steps slowly away from Farmer._)  Do you know my poetry?  (_Blake falls backwards over a cowering Cow #1.  As he falls he pulls the trigger.  A shot rings out._)

By God, I'm hit. Lord have mercy. Burns like hellfire. You son of a bitch. I'm gonna have to kill somebody now.  (_Cow #1 and Cow #2 establish eye contact and bolt for the open door, trampling William Blake to death in the process._)
