Fine. By the Power of Greyskull you open the door. You are in the 
kitchen of the white townhouse.  A table seems to have been used 
recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to the west, and a
 dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the east is a small 
window which is open. On the table is a computer open to [Healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/).
