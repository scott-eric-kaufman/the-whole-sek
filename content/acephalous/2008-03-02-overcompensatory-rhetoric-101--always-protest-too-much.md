## Overcompensatory Rhetoric 101: <em>Always</em> Protest Too Much

A skilled orator allows his argument to speak for itself.  _You_ must convince your audience of its merits.  The quality of the work is directly proportional to the time and effort put into its composition.  An "A" paper is one on which a pupil has worked very hard.  [Successful students](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/and\_yet\_i\_still.html) cultivate reputations as careful workers who deliberately construct serious, detailed arguments and  deserve every "A" they earn.  For example:

[Jonah Goldberg](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGY3ODg1ZGEyYjQ0OTYxYzc0Yzc0ZDNhN2Q1MzhjMDE=):  

It is a very _**serious**_, _**thoughtful**_, argument that has **_never_** been made in _**such detail**_ or with **_such care_**.

[Ann Althouse](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2008/03/why-are-letters-nig-on-childs-pajamas.html#4038780815809713424):

[T]his is a **_carefully_** written post that does not say **_anything_** incorrect ... and I say it _**absolutely**_ _**deliberately**_ and after **_much_** _**careful**_ thought.

Were it not for the presence of words like "serious" and "thoughtful," readers might believe that _someone somewhere_ once made an argument commensurate in detail and care to Mr. Goldberg's.  Similarly, Ms. Althouse's use of "carefully," "absolutely," and "deliberately" dispel any notion she could _ever_ say _anything_ incorrect.  Your audience will never trust you implicitly unless you repeatedly tell them why they should.  Fail to do so and your readers may just decide to judge your argument on its merit.

Here endeth the lesson.

If you're a less serious, less careful person you just free-associate a lot and call people motherfuckers for no good reason. I find that this method has much to recommend it.

This is absolutely without a doubt the most carefully thought out post I have ever read in my many, many years of reading blogs.

After much careful analysis, I found the major problem with the Clinton advertisement to be its prominence on the eve of Super Tuesday II. ABC's Senior Political Correspondent George Stephadisingenuous was able to air the Clinton ad, in whole or in part, approximately 11 times over the last three days on "This Week," "Good Morning America," "ABC World News" and "Nightline." 

Each time, Mr. Stephadisingenuous was somehow able to fail, utterly, to mention his connection to the Clintons.
