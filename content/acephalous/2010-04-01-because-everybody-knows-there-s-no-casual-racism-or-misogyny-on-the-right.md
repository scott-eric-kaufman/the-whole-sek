I went over to [Althouse](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2010/04/propagating-notion-that-tea-partiers.html)'s and wrote a number of insanely offensive comments, but everyone started agreeing with me before I could declare "April Fools'!" Please ignore comments in which someone talks about [trading](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2010/04/propagating-notion-that-tea-partiers.html?showComment=1270126906230#c4500497983299329219) in white women for Filipina because the former can't be trained; [calls](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2010/04/propagating-notion-that-tea-partiers.html?showComment=1270127259173#c9212443159867585842) strangers "cunts" in front of their kids or [justifies](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2010/04/propagating-notion-that-tea-partiers.html?showComment=1270146156226#c84435921376581173) calling strangers "cunts" in front of their kids on account of "Alinksyite incivility collapsing into mutual incivility"; [sings](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2010/04/propagating-notion-that-tea-partiers.html?showComment=1270129171149#c7145851105884693224) about it being "time to give the country to the darkies" or [advocates](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2010/04/propagating-notion-that-tea-partiers.html?showComment=1270134497968#c8093176889550000170) that popular means good; [claims](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2010/04/propagating-notion-that-tea-partiers.html?showComment=1270137187811#c3405696873805764751) that there were tea bags at the Boston Tea Party or [blames](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2010/04/propagating-notion-that-tea-partiers.html?showComment=1270145650351#c5208285889992321091) the firing of Don Imus on "the Progressive Jews and the non-Jewish Left" because they were all written by [an undercover agent](http://www.balloon-juice.com/2010/04/01/undercover-of-the-right-2/) in it for the lulz

Those good folks only wrote those terrible things because I baited them.

On the other hand "Scar my tattered body no more with your punishing dildo mallet," isn't that bad a line.

Department of the past isn't dead, [it isn't even past](http://amygdalagf.blogspot.com/2009/06/1977-or-example-of-why-i-have-little.html)  

Of course, it was obviously liberals in charge all the time.

Scott, your preview software pouted at both my attempt to embed the link, and to post it raw.  I only was able to post by reloading the page and carefully _not_ previewing.  Just mentioning so you are aware, and also you owe me four-plus minutes.

Except that I ended up, with all that backing and forthing and dozen times, accidentally wound up at the wrong entry.  Sigh.  Will repost.  For the 9th or so attempt.

I remember Stephen "Shouting" Thomas from his days on HNN. The rest of them are real charmers, yeah. Too bad that April Fool thing didn't work out!

Do any of those links still work? I was hoping for some cheap entertainment, but all I'm getting is vigorous assurance that cheap entertainment was once to be had.

Vance, "Chase"'s comment (the one about telling the libtard's 11-year-old daughter what teabagging the sex act means) is still there. Just click on 'Oldest' to get to the first comments, or on the blog post title.

Vance, sorry about that.  She changed the title of the post in order to break my link, and now her commenters are claiming I actually wrote those comments, because they're illiterate.

The comments are still there, if you go looking for them. Althouse changed the link? She's got less class than I thought, and my opinion of her was pretty damn low to begin with. And most of those comments are by identifiable people (see above on Thomas, etc.) who are clearly not you. I'm impressed, though at the lengths to which they'll go to avoid criticism.

I visit the Althouse site regularly for one reason; to aggravate the living hell out of them, and it doesn't take much. All one has to do is disagree with the "Queen's" wing nut pack about literally anything, or better yet, post a comment reflecting approval of anything President Obama has ever said or done...and they go completely out of their minds.

What was the moniker you used to post your comments?

SEK, I actually do think this was a poor course of action. When you have folks like Jeremy commenting on your posts thinking that you actually did, um, "moby"(bizarre term, why not "troll"?) Althouse's site, it should say something about how your action will be interpreted by Althouse and her fans, whom doubtlessly know less about your tenure status or the other elements of the situation. More broadly, I don't think doing an April Fools prank that involved someone else's website was a very good idea- normally how April Fools works on the internet is that the website readers get fooled. notice how the interpretations occurring here are largely based on that premise.
