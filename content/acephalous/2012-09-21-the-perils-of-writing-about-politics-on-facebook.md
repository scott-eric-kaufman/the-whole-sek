_After reading the [two](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/people-who-only-talk-to-themselves-either-already-are-or-drive-themselves-crazy) [posts](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/anyone-want-to-pay-me-1000000-to-produce-a-video-of-obama-choking-on-a-matzo-ball)
 I wrote yesterday evening, SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL decided that he’d had 
enough, but instead of just quietly cutting me adrift he decided he 
wanted to have the last word._ 

> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** I want you to know  I’m blocking you, asshole. Every time you write about how much you love  Romney you prove you hate America and the troops. I just wanted to be  the man who manned up and said FUCK YOU to your face.
> 
> **SEK:** I think you meant “Obama.”
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** FUCK YOU!
> 
> **SEK:** You already said that.
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** FUCK OFF!
> 
> **SEK:** Didn’t you block me?
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** ASSHOLE!
> 
> **SEK:** Would you like me to tell you how to block me?

_After reading the comments that appeared after [I posted the above as a status update](https://www.facebook.com/scotterickaufman/posts/10101294038203921), SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL wrote me back._

> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** You’re laughing at me!
> 
> **SEK:** I am.
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** I can read it!
> 
> **SEK:** You can. My feed’s public.
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** But we’re not friends anymore!
> 
> **SEK:** My feed’s public.
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** Fuck your feed! Make it stop!
> 
> **SEK:** So far as anyone knows, I’m mocking a _generic_ conservative bigot.  As long as you don’t comment on it no one will know I’m mocking _you_.
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** (_comments on the previous post while I write the above, then demands_) DELETE MY COMMENT NOW ASSHOLE!
> 
> **SEK:** You wrote it. Delete it yourself.
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** I did. (_he didn’t_)
> 
> **SEK:** (_so I did_) Good for you.
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** Now delete what you wrote.
> 
> **SEK:** No.
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** DO IT NOW!
> 
> **SEK:** No.
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** MAKE IT SO I CAN’T SEE IT!
> 
> **SEK:** My feed’s public.
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** I DON’T WANT TO SEE IT!
> 
> **SEK:** Then don’t look at it.
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** THEY’RE MAKING FUN OF ME!
> 
> **SEK:** They are.
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** FUCKING DEMOCRATS!
> 
> **SEK:** If you insist.
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** I DO!
> 
> **SEK:** Good for you.
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** YOU DON’T KNOW ME! I FUCKING HATE YOU!
> 
> **SEK:** You realize I’m going to post this too, don’t you?
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** YOU BETTER NOT!
> 
> **SEK:** Why?
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** WE’RE NOT EVEN FRIENDS ANYMORE!
> 
> **SEK:** Then what reason do I have not to post it?
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** ASSHOLE! DON’T DO IT!
> 
> **SEK:** OBAMA COMMANDED ME. I HAVE NO CHOICE.
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** …
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** …
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** …
> 
> **SEK:** That was a joke.
> 
> **SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL:** FUCK YOU I KNEW THAT!

There was a point there where your continued dialogue began to reveal more about your character and judgment than his, Scott.  I'm not sure of the exact demarcation, but it was somewhere around your third or fourth response.

This is about as profound and penetrating as any conversation I've ever seen on Facebook. The appeal of the form continues to elude me entirely...

You should replace the "FROM" in "SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL" with "IN."

That I have more in common with game in my SEKOCOM posts than I'd like to admit, yes.

That you have a sense of humour and thought your loyal (if infrequently commenting) readers would enjoy the exchange as much as you did?
