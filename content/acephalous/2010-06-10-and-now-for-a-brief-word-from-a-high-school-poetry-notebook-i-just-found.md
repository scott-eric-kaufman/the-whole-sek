(I'm still basically on hiatus for the next week: grading, cleaning, recovering, etc.  Will be back soon, though, with much about comics as I draft the manuscript.  That said, the above tells you everything you need to know about the state of education in Louisiana.)

Those old carbon-based word processing utilities didn't have much of a spellcheck function, did they?

I do believe your feeling have not changed much!  Just think how I felt when I found the notes while cleaning at my house.  I was wondering how long it would be before you would use them on the blogg.  You really have enough writings to fill a year or more of postings or perhaps it is time to write a book!

You'll be submitting that to failblog, naturally? The world must share in this moment!

Man our kids isn't learning good in Louisana all right.  Only an idoit wouldn't know that April, June, Spetmeber and a bunch of other months come after February.  

It takes a good speller to know how to spell Febyouary, though.
