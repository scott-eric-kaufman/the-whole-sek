## Survey Says?

What about now?  I still haven't been able to resolve the centered bullets and comments in Internet Explorer, but I've contacted TypePad so that should be resolved soon enough.  You'll note the return of my headless avatar and a darkening of the center column (which should resolve Jonathan's concerns about readability).  

I'll screw around with it more later this evening, but now I've got a dissertation to write.  (Or try to.)

How about the ultimate time-saver -- just putting everything back as it was?  I think that the original quote about travelers still finding acephalous people in America fit your Americanism well, and I don't see how setting off the A in Acephalous in a different color and text size in the banner really adds anything.  Plus I think that your old color scheme was more readable.  (And didn't Jonathan want dark text on a light background?)

I like it.  There's better harmony between the parts.  And maybe the initial A doesn't add anything, but I'm a medievalist and I like it.  I bet the Little Womedievalist feels the same - no?  (Though that quote from the original was pretty funny and apt.)

The yellow on black is a little googly-eye making, however.

Yes, dark text on light background and a picture of Dog the Bounty Hunter in the banner. Then you'll have it.

I don't usually like pale text on dark backgrounds, but this colour combination (with the large font size) works pretty well for me. But I'm not convinced by the sidebars. I'd be inclined to try a slightly smaller and probably sans-serif font for contrast with the main body. 

You probably just need to add "text-align:left;" to the comments styling somewhere. And there's no earthly reason why you shouldn't be able to have a fluid three-column layout with centred banner. 

And BTW, what's all that, er, stuff in the source code at the bottom of your right sidebar? I couldn't for the life of me work out why there was all that (seemingly) blank space between the Creative Commons logo and the Technorati link until I looked at it.

I really like the darkened center column. Much easier to read the text. The headless avatar belongs here and should never be forsaken. The new banner I'm a bit more ambivalent about--I kind of liked the bookcase/stamp thing.

I'm working on the banner, Belle.  It's not finished yet, I swear.  (And to answer Dr. V's earlier question about block letters: I had one up there, but then realized it looked an awful lot like [this](http://newkidonthehallway.typepad.com/).

Sharon, the stuff down there is my failed attempt to link to 1) various blog posts and 2) particular areas of voice of the shuttle.  I tried to automate it, but as you can see from my stunning knowledge of HTML, well, I'm not too good at it.  I just blackened it out for now, but plan on having a friend help me set it up this weekend.  Should be fun, exciting, and an easy way for me to keep track of conversations I'm participating in.  At least, that's what it'll be in theory, you know, a kind of comment-centric version of the "Of Interest Elsewhere" listing I added to the left-column on Saturday.  

Thanks for the tip on the centering problems too, since that's a key IE issue.  I've managed to stump TypePad's support staff, I think, since they can't figure out what comments and bulleted items have in common.  

Also, I should add I've always found the light text on a dark background easier to read; but then again, I remember using 4DOS, so that should say a little something about my tastes in these matters.  So long as I don't actively drive anyone away...

And the centering thing is fixed!  Now, back to the dissertation for a while, then back to the banner.

Perhaps [CoComment](http://www.cocomment.com/) would be of use to you, Scott.

I second Jonathan's request for a photo of Dog the Bounty Hunter.
