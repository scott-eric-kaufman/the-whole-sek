Now how about the roster of \*blind\* Jewish mathematicians?

The context is pretty obvious...

I think your links have broken. Unless it's my browser. Or unless, somehow, that was your point.

But it did get me to wondering. Is there the equivalent of "Sigma" and the other mathematical symbols in ASL?

LOL -- that's the whole point.  Read Derrida: math is an entirely \*written\* language.

...

But there's no reason why there couldn't be.  Anything can be a symbol for anything, within reason.

Why is the Chemical Rubber Company interested in mathematics?

The links are broken because it's a edited copy of an actual page: [http://jinfo.org/Mathematics.html.](http://jinfo.org/Mathematics.html.) Also, I don't think you need to read Derrida to realize the silliness of the question about sign language, considering that there isn't even an equivalent of that sigma in \*English\*; it is instead read somewhat awkwardly as "sum".

True.  But I like it that D. had something to say about math.

I for one take great offense to this post, as I am both Jewish and the recipient of \*several\* prestigious math awards, some of which are still affixed to my Mom's refrigerator.  My hearing's just fine, though every once in a while I need things repeated.

jhr, that's not _quite_ the context, but close enough.  All I'll say is: 

I _**dominated**_ a statistical-based something or other for a good three years despite demonstrating, on multiple occasions, profound ignorance of basic mathematic principles including, but not limited to, addition, subtraction multiplication and division.  

That David Light fellow, on the other hand, is merely Jewish, deaf, and challenged (mathematically speaking).

That said, the broken links are a nice touch, no?
