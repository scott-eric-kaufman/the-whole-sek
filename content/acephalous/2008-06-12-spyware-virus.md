Don't leave us hanging! Did the computer perform an emergency save, or has the chapter been eaten by a (spyware) grue?

All told I lost about 15 minutes of work, or about thirty words, twenty of which I'd already decided to cut anyway.  So no big loss.  Of course, the fact that I can't access my preferred database means that I want nothing more in this world than to check this source and re-run that search, such that I'm effectively paralyzed.
