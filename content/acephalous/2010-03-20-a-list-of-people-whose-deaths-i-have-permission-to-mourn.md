## A list of people whose deaths I have permission to mourn.

An annoying anonymous person [writes](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/03/remembering-alex-chilton.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef01310fc286f2970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01310fc286f2970c):

Why is it 
any time anyone hipsters or academics are supposed to like dies, they 
just so happen to be very important never-before-mentioned influences on
 your life? Are you really so needy that there's no death you won't use
 as an excuse to call attention to yourself?

Although this comment belongs to the tedious category of "complaints about bloggers having blogs and writing about stuff on them," it nevertheless struck a chord: first, because the size of the community grieving for Alex Chilton surprised me; and second, it seems to be a dangerous time to be a living artist or academic who changed my life.  That said, this annoying anonymous person is reading in bad faith: not everyone who influenced me did so greatly or uniquely, which is why I [noted](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/04/kurt\_vonnegut\_r.html) Kurt Vonnegut's passing in passing, as a "Vonnegut phase" is required to join the community of readers.  The same cannot be said of those academics and artists with whom I shared an intimate relationship over many years, which is why I wrote individual remembrances of [Octavia Butler](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/since\_ive\_bloss.html), [David Foster Wallace](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/theres-too-much.html), [Howard Zinn](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/01/on-the-significance-of-jd-salinger-and-howard-zinn.html), or [Alex Chilton](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/03/remembering-alex-chilton.html).    

If I seem to be too familiar a type, blame central casting: academics play the part because that's the part they've been asked to play.  That there seems to be a wider community of similarly interested intellectuals is, to my mind, a sign that while academic disciplines may be irrevocably balkanized, something resembling a larger intellectual culture still exists.  Whether this cultural homogeneity is a good thing depends on what it actually contains, and given how surprising Chilton's inclusion image was to me, I probably should refrain from saying much more about it.    

However, in light of the recent proliferation of lists like [this](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/03/influential-books.php), I think I'll take a moment to silence future scolds by listing all living authors, musicians, and filmmakers with whose work I feel a deeply irrational kinship.  They may not still move me as they once did, but _they once did_ and when they die a little bit of me will too.

I've also most likely forgot a lot of things I used to love, and as such reserve the right to add items to any of the above lists should the death of someone not currently on them result in an unexpected gut-check.

Much to my surprise, I'd read four of Yglesias's books and three more of his authors. Your list tends  toward "get off my lawn", which of course is where you want to be. Poor Yglesias.

I was surprised by how much fiction was on Yglesias's list, actually, given what he wrote about _Infinite Jest_ as the last big, important novel he'll ever feel obliged to read.  I'm not surprised, however, that so much appears on mine: for all my talk of historicism, I'm really all about the stories and the most unique and/or powerful ways to tell them.

Let me guess: he likes it because it's a bona fide Russian novel that's only 80 pages long?  I like Yglesias as far as it goes, but I'm going to have be a snob on this front, I think.

While this is a useful exercise, of sorts, ultimately the complaint is, as you start out by noticing, pretty damn stupid. 

I was surprised by the number of bloggers I read who noted Chilton's death. I'd never heard of him, and very little of what I read (noting, of course, that writing about music, especially music you love, rarely conveys the actual experience) suggested that I'd really enjoy his stuff. But at some point I'll have to check out a few of the linked tracks and see, at least for some basic cultural literacy.

Just pre-produce your obits like the newspapers do. That way you will only have to update the particulars of time and place but you'll have covered the bulk of their bodies of work. Maybe even guess their date of demise and post-mark your blog entries accordingly. Sure its a little macabre undertaking but a great writing exercise.

_He used to go on about Lermentov. I wonder what happened with that._

I heard that a good new translation came out recently, I'm eager to check it out. 

_Let me guess: he likes it because it's a bona fide Russian novel that's only 80 pages long? I like Yglesias as far as it goes, but I'm going to have be a snob on this front, I think._

That's kind of a jerky thing to say. I've read what I think is a healthy dose of long-ass Russian novels (Anna Karenina, Crime & Punishment, Brothers Karamazov, War & Peace, etc.) but a lot of reasonably literate people haven't heard of Lermontov so I like to take opportunities to talk him up.

_He may have read it in actual Russian._

Still only 80 pages, but point taken.

_Not one  professional cricketer? For shame, Kaufman, for shame._

See, that's what I mean: I didn't even have any baseball players on the list.  Exceptions are already abounding, but basically, whenever an '86 Met dies, I'm going to be heartbroken.

_I'd never heard of him, and very little of what I read (noting, of course, that writing about music, especially music you love, rarely conveys the actual experience) suggested that I'd really enjoy his stuff._

Ahistoricality: most of the posts I've read have focused on the first two albums, but it's really _Third/Sister Lovers_ that's influential.  Check out his haunting, drugged vocals on "[Holocaust](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsQ977u8Wuk)," or the odd instrumentation on "[Kangaroo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6a9yxUyOOI)," or how Chilton lurched through pop on "[O Dana](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkeOnZiopo0)" or "Stroke it Noel."  The songs are falling apart as they're being played, but they're breaking compellingly, with a conviction that authentically sound like compositions written by a broken man with impeccable pop sensibilities.  

_Just pre-produce your obits like the newspapers do. That way you will only have to update the particulars of time and place but you'll have covered the bulk of their bodies of work. Maybe even guess their date of demise and post-mark your blog entries accordingly. Sure its a little macabre undertaking but a great writing exercise._

Jason, I need to dig up that old New Yorker article on the _Times_' curator of obits, because it's 1) awesome, and 2) the description of what is and isn't notable pre-dates Wikipedia and its standards, but I don't remember how and want to.

Matt, I didn't mean it in a jerky way, only a lit-snob one, by referring to what you wrote [here](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/09/infinite-jest.php):

Adding new possible ways to entertain ourselves naturally starts to squeeze out the viability of some old ways. And maybe the long novel is among the squeezed. Which seems in some ways regrettable (which I take it is part of the point of Infinite Jest) but at the same time to really be a feature of the world.

Forms that are getting squeezed from the world aren't, perforce, going to be influential.

_does Noam Chomsky still move you SEK?_ 

Not so much, Jake.  I can't deny how powerful _Manufacturing Consent_ was to me as a media-critical youth, but it was forever bumped from its pedestal by Robert McChesney's _Rich Media, Poor Democracy_, and the same can be said for most of Chomsky's political work.  As an undergraduate linguistics major, I'm one of the few people who's read his political work and thinks _Syntactic Structure_ and _Cartesian Linguistics_ are crucial elements of any intellectual history of the 20th century.  I'm less sanguine, though, about his attacks on what he considers postmodernism, for the obvious reasons.  (Which reminds me: I need to add Jameson to that list above, as he was the first living theorist whose works I barreled through.)

Jake:

In all honesty, most of my political reading isn't in books these days, but long-form journalism and academic articles, so it's a toss up between _The Nation_, _The Economist_, _New Left Review_, etc.  My "serious non-fiction book" reading either concerns 1) academic works on comics or 2) secondary literature about late-19th Century American fiction, so I don't forget what I'll need should I ever go on the market as the Americanist I am (instead of the visual rhetoric scholar I'm becoming).

Sean and Nick: 

I mean the early, bouncy stuff.  Seriously, _Snow Crash_ and _The Diamond Age_ were heady, inventive literary thrillers that changed how I thought about our relation to technology; _Cryptonomicon_ made me realize that it's possible for infodumps to be elegant, a realization I'd later regret once I determined that Stephenson hadn't shared it, just lucked out.  (I'm not sure about _Anathem_, which I started but had to put down shortly after it was published.)
