Next time you invite [John Williams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman\_music#Original\_recording\_information) to score an inauguration, make sure he gets it right.Â  If I may offer a suggestion:

This was indeed weak sauce -- not least because the hymn is indelibly associated with another piece and another composer. As if I were to write a set of variations on a [chorale attributed to Haydn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV7cWW42tTw).

My version isn't.  (I edited it to make it clear that I wasn't reposting the actual performance, but a NEW and IMPROVED version.)

Vance is right; Williams' rescoring of Copland's version of a Shaker hymn had to qualify as one of the sillier moments. Right up there with Aretha Franklin's hat.

And Scott's right: we really were expecting something with a little more energy, maybe even a _touch_ of originality. I'm used to Williams stealing tonal qualities and melodic licks (listen to Holst's Planets and then the Star Wars soundtrack, for those of you who don't already know what I mean), but he wasn't even trying this time.

I'm guiltily somewhat relieved that Elizabeth Alexander's poem didn't work out, because [my inaugural poem](http://rpuchalsky.blogspot.com/2009/01/poetry-for-obamas-inauguration.html) was about the best I can do, and it didn't get demolished by comparison with a really good one.  So I'm pleased about that.  Not that I should really be commenting about it on this poetry-scorning blog.
