## The Ivory Tower?

Literary scholars are so__isolated from what happens in the world.  (So say them all.)  Today, for example, in between [arguing with conservatives about what constitutes a legitimate argument](http://proteinwisdom.com/index.php?/weblog/entry/21008/); taking [brutal (but clean) body blows from Arbiter of Fairness himself, Timothy Burke](http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/comments/1048/); and [revealing too much of what I'd planned to say about _The Truth about Diversity_](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week\_2006\_09\_17.html#005467)—in between _all that_, I read the following articles by Silas Weir Mitchell:

*   Imperforate Anus (1851)
*   A Case of Vicarious Secretion of Milk (1855)
*   Improved Spirometer (1856)
*   Muscular Phenomena Following a Blow on Muscle From a Percussion Hammer (1858)
*   Improved Spirometer (1858)
*   Notes upon the Effect of Alcohol, Glycerin, Water, Gum, Ammonia, and the Vacuum upon the Exposed Hearts of Frogs, Snapping Turtles, and Sturgeons (1859)
*   Experimental Researches Relative to Corroval and Vao—Two New Varieties of Woorara (1859)
*   An Experimental Examination of the Toxicological Effect of Sassy Bark (1859)
*   Zoospermes of the Frog: Concerning their Vitality and the Transplantation of the Testicles of One Animal to Another (1861)
*   A Case of Preternatural Anus (1861)
*   On the Growth of the Nails as a Prognostic Indication in Cerebral Paralysis (1863)
*   Reflex Paralysis, the Result of Gunshot Wounds, Founded Chiefly upon Cases Observed on General Hospital (1864)
*   On Malingering (1864)
*   On the Production of Paralysis in Birds (1868)
*   On the Insusceptility of Pigeons to the Toxic Action of Opium (1869)
*   Observations on Poisoning with Rattlesnake Venom (1870)
*   On the Growth of the Nails as a Prognostic Indication in Cerebral Paralysis (1870)
*   On the Growth of the Nails as a Prognostic Indication in Cerebral Paralysis (1871)
*   The Rate of Growth of Nails as a Means of Diagnosing Certain Forms of Paralysis (1872)

Mitchell's titles lost their Frankensteinian hilarity as American medicine became more professional and concentrated its attentions on nails.  And their rates of growth.  As a means of diagnosing paralysis.  (Because, what, the lack of movement didn't give it away?)

Those early titles remind me of a bit I used to perform at parties about the trial-and-error stage of chiropractic history: 
_Now I will expose the beating heart!  To glycerin!  And gum!_

Only in the original bit, I'd _crack-the-back crack-the-back crack-the-back_.  You know, _experimentally_.  Sadly, Eddie Izzard stole my bit.  Now, I'll have to prove that literary scholars don't spend all their time secluded in their ivory towers by making small-talk about transplanting the testes of one animal into another.  (One with a preternatual anus, no less.)  

I'll be the belle of all the balls ...

The gutter this post bumbled into?  Well, like I said, I'd been reading _political blogs_ all day.  What more can you expect?  I'm shocked I could string two thoughts together ...

You read all those articles?  Or you read the _titles_ of all those articles?  Because, frankly, the latter seems to me more than enough.

When I first read it, I thought you were going for an EA Poe reference at the end there.

With regard to the whole Althouse thing, Timothy Burke is basically right -- not that you're a preternatural anus, but because there are some arguments that it's best not to even bother with.  In particular, it makes no sense these days to have any kind of argument across the liberal-conservative divide.  Liberals can argue with libertarians to their right and socialists to their left, if they want to indulge themselves in inconsequential argument.  But conservatives don't argue.  They are basically irrational, and can only be fought.

"A Case of Preternatural Anus"?  What makes an anus preternatural?

Adam, yes, I read 'em all.  The problem with dealing with figures on the cusp of medicine's professionalization is that they like to intersperse their medical papers with theories of intentionality in literature and etiology.  It's unfortunate, but at least it provides me some ancillary entertainment.

Bill, I wish I could say I _knew_ the reference you I was going for ... but I've _quite a bit_ of work to do before I can call myself a C19th Americanist and not feel like a fake.

Rich, yes, I realize that.  Being called, albeit indirectly, a "tool" by Timothy made me reevaluate my life's work.  I stewed all day, and all of the night ... until I realized that there's a time for nuance, and then there isn't.  I mistook the latter for the former.  That said, I _still_ believe I can communicate with intelligent conservatives (and that such beasts exist), and for the time being, I'll take Timothy and Michael's examples to heart ...

ben, I could email you a copy of the article, but that'd just ruin the joke ...

All that fairness is giving Tim Burke an ulcer.  Note that I didn't say "is going to give Tim Burke an ulcer" -- it's already at work as we speak.  Next time you read one of his comments, picture him chugging the Pepto as he types.
