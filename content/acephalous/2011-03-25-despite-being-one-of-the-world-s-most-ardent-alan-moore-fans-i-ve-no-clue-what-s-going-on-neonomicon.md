## Despite being one of the world's most ardent Alan Moore fans, I've no clue what's going on *Neonomicon*.

Which has the strange result of making some of its most disturbing moments read as unintentional comedy.  To wit:

[![Alan moore - neonomicon](../../images/acephalous/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e601b8fb1970c-500wi "Alan moore - neonomicon")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e601b8fb1970c-popup)   

I mean, if _you_ were an anthropomorphic fish-penis hybrid and the woman you'd been raping for a week asked "What the fuck is _wrong_ with you?" you'd answer with an emphatic "HOORNGH!" too. \*

\* I wasn't kidding when I said I don't understand this book one bit.  I hear tell the fourth and final issue's just come out, so maybe that'll make sense of it ... then I remember how _Promothea_ concluded and entertain some serious doubts.  All right, enough "fun" reading for me, I'm back to work on the Clowes post.

* * *

I have not read Neonomicon.  However when I asked a local comic book store guy what Moore was doing lately, he told me about the series and said that it was basically an attempt to confront head-on the racist and sexual subtext in Lovecraft.  He also said that Alan Moore has achieved a status in which he could basically do anything he wanted, with a strong implication that maybe Neonomicon was just perverse sexual fantasies and not much else.  My apologies to the actual person in question since I'm sure I didn't get the nuances of what they said.

It's far too Moore-ish to just be about perverse sexual fantasies, and more to the point, it's at odds with the sexual politics he established in _Lost Girls_, so I do think he's parsing the Lovecraft here.  To what end, I've no idea -- by which I mean, why write a comic critique of Lovecraft's sexual and sexual-political short-comings?  Such an endeavor would just be, you know, fundamentally _odd_.  Since I wrote the post, I've picked up the fourth issue, which makes clear that much of the nonsense-prose just needs to be read aloud by a person with a deaf accent.  For example, "What is this, is you're a nun, see asian merry," turns into "What is this, is your annunciation, Mary," which means all that rape had something to do with God and reproduction, but again, to what end, I can't fathom.

"why write a comic critique of Lovecraft's sexual and sexual-political short-comings?"

It's magic, dude.  Lovecraft is a core source for Moore and his whole SF/fantasy milleau.  He's also really really problematic even by the standards of his own time, let along ours.  So I'd guess that this is an important reworking for Moore if for no one else.   He's got a Lovecraft-land bobbing around in his imagination, which is very real to Moore -- see Glycon etc. -- and reworking it is important.

How is this reworking it?  I can see a bit of it just from these two panels.  It's the horror of non-voicelessness within horror.  The victims in this kind of Lovecraftian script are supposed to be immediately traumatized and not say anything, much less still attempt to bargain with their captors.

I think that the problem with understanding later Alan Moore is that by this point he's ingested enough LSD to kill an ox.

By making the rapist a dramatically attractive we can all can identify with, Moore forces us to acknowledge with our rape fantasies.

Or maybe it's just me.

My brain hurts. I'm trying to reconcile "a dramatically attractive person" with "anthropomorphic fish-penis hybrid."

_Lovecraft is a core source for Moore and his whole SF/fantasy milleau. He's also really really problematic even by the standards of his own time, let along ours. So I'd guess that this is an important reworking for Moore if for no one else._ 

Rich, I think that's it.  Problem is, at least, _my_ problem is that I read Lovecraft a lifetime ago, and what I remember isn't as resonant as Moore thinks it is.  (Again, to my mind, as I'm _embarrassingly_ past [The Five Year Rule](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/a\_very\_unfunny\_.html) with Lovecraft.)  (Because I'm old.)

_I think that the problem with understanding later Alan Moore is that by this point he's ingested enough LSD to kill an ox._ 

I know he dropped out after being busted, but I also remember him saying, in one of those documentaries, that he stopped taking LSD because he didn't want to become Grant Morrison.  (I also remember Morrison taking offense, but oddly, Google's not confirming my memories.  I'm probably Googling the wrong drug.)  ("Googling the wrong drug," of course, being slang in an unwritten Samuel Delany novel for unspeakable acts.)

_Or maybe it's just me._

I believe it is, John.  I really, _really_ believe it is.

If you want a quick-and-dirty refresher on Lovecraft, I recommend _The Adventures of Samurai Cat_ ("What a stud."). Actually, Lovecraft aside, I'd love to know if you know the book (or series, but I've never done more than glance at the sequels).

I don't.  My ignorance is deep and wide, like an ocean.  On another planet.  Revolving around a dead star.  But given 1) my limited time, 2) my desire to understand this damn Moore book, and 3) my reluctance to re-read Lovecraft, I'm all for picking it up.

It's not just Moore who thinks it's resonant, though, if by resonant you mean "occupying significant mental space" or something like that.  For instance, here's a link to [an art project where 8-14 year olds draw Lovecraft monsters](http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/11/16/children-draw-h-p-lovecraft-cthulhu/).  He's gotten his own adjective, "Lovecraftian", that really is better than any other word or short phrase at describing a certain set of cultural artifacts.  You may or may not like Lovecraft, either at a critical or personal level, but he's there whether you like him or not.

Let's make a little list.  Who are the main written sources for the contemporary pop fantasy imagination in English?  By "pop", I mean leaving out ur-sources like the Greek myths, and high-culture sources like Spenser, and folk sources like the Arthurian legends.  Also leave out comics because I don't want to look up who did Superman etc.

1. H. G. Wells  

2. Tolkien  

3. Robert E. Howard  

4. Lovecraft  

5. PKD  

6. Poe

And then I go um.....  no doubt I'm leaving out obvious people.  Cabell and Vance are for writer-type readers, basically.  Michael Moorcock might make the list next: Elric primarily.  But I think that Lovecraft is somewhere in the top 5.

Readable Lovecraft?  There are lots of short stories.  Or try The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath.

Looking back at my list above, you'd only need to add two authors to cover pretty much all of the main characters in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, including the text backstory in the (second or third?) volume.  That's H. Rider Haggard and Bram Stoker.  I would have thought that the whole Lost World subgenre had lost currency these days, but as wiki points out, Indiana Jones is a Haggard influence.  Bram Stoker's stuff is Gothic, and I question how much he added to vampire mythos that wasn't in his sources and in earlier books like Camilla.  But if we put him in, then Mary Shelley should of course go in too as being more important.  And if Haggard, then probably E. R. Burroughs (Tarzan, John Carter of Mars).

That puts the list up to ten, with Lovecraft still convincingly somewhere in the middle.

Oh, and Verne of course.  I'd been leaving him out because he didn't write in English.  But in contemporary terms I'd guess he'd be upper-to-mid-list somewhere.

Oh, right, and Robert Louis Stevenson, who I really should have remembered earlier.  Perhaps some inverted snobbery there, because I've been thinking about decidedly pulp-ish authors, and Stevenson is really quite good in a literary sense (at least, I remember The Master of Ballantrae as being so).  But Treasure Island puts him as the main English source for the whole pirate mythos at this point, so he should be in there somewhere.

All right, I'll stop with this already.  But the point is that Alan Moore's influences are not too different from the general English influences on the area of the imagination that Moore is invested in.   It's not just his personal crotchet that he thinks it's important to rework Lovecraft.

It seems to me that not a lot of attention is paid to Lovecraft's own unpleasantness in everyday discourse on Lovecraftian things; perhaps Moore is trying to revive knowledge of what a berk Lovecraft was and the following unpleasant implications of Lovecraft's fiction, akin to what Moore did with Ian Fleming in League of Ext. Gents (James Bond being a scummy rapist who did well during Ingsoc etc)?

On Moore and Lovecraft's unpleasantness, we can't overlook the Planetary/Authority crossover issue, where a bunch of eldritch beasts hatch out of what Lovecraft (a character in the comic) mistakes for "Negro eggs," I believe.  Which is just to say, Moore has a demonstrated interested in confronting Lovecraft's less savory side. (Not that Lovecraft has what you'd call a savory side.  The unsavory side is where his bread is buttered.)

And I am, of course, a fool.  Ellis wrote Planetary, it doesn't even smell like a Moore comic.  So scratch that point, and mock me, please.

Not sure about James T's and Jesse A's comments. While of course I wouldn't mock Jesse A for getting authorship wrong -- as if I haven't done that a lot -- both of these comments seem a bit off.

Partly it's that I don't think that Lovecraft's racism is as unknown or in need of excavation as these comments imply. If you look at the Lovecraft wiki page, there's a whole section on "Race, Ethnicity and Class". Basically, people read the stories, note that whenever there's a mob of evil cultists holding some orgiastic rite they just happen to be black people, and go yeah, there's racism here. His personal racism is really well-discussed, and there's been no attempt to paper it over by his chief critics. (Except, possibly, in the sense that his life story is one of such a loser that it's tempting to excuse his racism through his loserdom in the familiar American fashion. You know: New Deal Democrat, moderate socialist, seemingly able to see where his economic interests were but seemingly needed to feel superior to somebody.)

But (and again, I haven't read this work yet) I can't really imagine that that is what Moore is doing. Moore doesn't just write things like this in order to point out unpleasant implications or confront something's less savory side. I would really strongly guess that there is something positive that Moore sees in Lovecraft that he's trying to reevaluate and preserve.

*Readable Lovecraft? There are lots of short stories.*

Hell yes there are. Lemme recommend 'The Colour out of Space,' 'The Call of Cthulhu' (seriously) and 'The Dunwich Horror,' the latter two of which are 'problematic' stories including either HPL's racist unpleasantness or (central to 'Dunwich') his paranoia about inbreeding, but all three of which are absolutely extraordinary stories. There's a decently-formatted (legal) complete PDF of all HPL's fiction floating around the Internet, with uncorrected texts but without, y'know, a price tag.

Folks oughtn't complain about Lovecraft's awful character traits (racism both standard and custom-made, sexual horror, eugenic enthusiasm, possible Nazi sympathies, weird fish/tentacle obsession) but pass over, say, Alan Moore's own perversities, misanthropy, and probably insanity.

(Says the ardent Dave Sim fan.)

* * *

Wax Banks, that's funny--during an internet browse recently, I came across a message board discussion from '05 or so in which someone asked why people lambast Sim for his crazy beliefs but give Moore's crazy beliefs a pass. The answer, supplied by several people, seemed obvious: Sim's lunacy is prescriptive, where Moore's is not. Sim wants to convince people that his way of looking at the world is correct, where Moore doesn't, and to the extent that people agreed with Sim, the result would be harmful, which is not the case with Moore. (The worst you can say about Moore's beliefs is that they sometimes damaged his work, and even then I'm mainly just thinking of Promethea.

I haven't read Lovecraft so I won't comment on him, but I will say that I don't see any contradiction between complaining about one author being racist in his writing, while not complaining about another author being personally eccentric. Racism is harmful while snake-worship and polyamory don't seem to be.

As for Moore's misanthropy: what do you have in mind?

* * *

Does Moore have crazy beliefs? As far as I can tell, the whole Glycon thing is somewhere between a metaphor and a joke. I don't even think they damaged his work: Promethea turned out to be much more interesting and individually characteristic than the yawner "alternate" hero book that it started out as.

* * *

Rich, that's a good point; I was granting the premise, but in fact Moore seems perfectly grounded in his beliefs, rather than committed to them, describing them as "mad" again and again) (We can agree to disagree on Promethea.)

Another way of putting it is that "personal character traits" aren't the issue here--character traits are trivia--but rather the work itself. The problem isn't racist beliefs but racist work, or in the case of Sim misogynistic work (taking his prose writings to be part of his work). On this basis there's no complaint about Moore at all.

Case in point: William Marston, the guy who created Wonder Woman, was a polyamorist / BDSM practitioner (at least the bondage part). Wonder Woman's bracelets were supposedly modeled on the bracelets that one of his partners wore -- I forget whether it was his wife or their lover, but it doesn't make much difference since the three of them were married in all but name: they lived together, he had kids by each, and the two women continued to live together after he died. He had weird beliefs that being tied up and/or tying women up made men less aggressive in some way. He also invented the lie detector, which as any listener to the [Dead Kennedys](http://www.mp3lyrics.org/d/dead-kennedys/lie-detector/) knows was used in a lot of false-positive setting people up.

Is any of that relevant to criticism of Wonder Woman? The bondage part certainly is, because it appears in the character design and all throughout the early plots, which feature people getting tied up not only routinely but... oddly. (As in sorority rituals, for instance.) For the rest I can't really see how it is. With his lie detector junk science / self promotion, Marston probably did more damage to actual people than any other comic book writer, certainly more than someone like Lovecraft, whose crazy racist theories never gained currency. But that doesn't seem to me to adhere to the work itself.
