...and never underestimate the stupidity of stupid, stupid rat creatures:

Trolls are no smarter.  I've scrubbed all the comments this "[Master of Proxies](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/09/the-opinion-of-the-birds-on-the-discrimination-against-ninjas-at-.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef0134875a8825970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0134875a8825970c)" left while I was in Kings Canyon National Park living the kind of life someone like him can only envy, but if he leaves any more, don't bother to respond.  They too will be scrubbed tomorrow as soon as I'm awake enough to "Censor" his "First Amendment Right" to deface my property.

Do you have any idea what the hell he's so angry about?

Anyway, if you wish to speak to him in his own language, just reply to him with "u mad, bro?" whenever you're forced to converse.  It's an insult upon him, if he bears it.

_Do you have any idea what the hell he's so angry about?_

I actually do, and it's nothing more esoteric than a G-R-A-D-E I gave him last quarter.  (I'd be worried about transparency here, but he's already proven he can't spell.)

He went through SEVEN PROXIES!  Because proxies work like that scene in _Sneakers_, where if you layer them on top of each other they MULTIPLY their POWER!

Well, given the caliber of his writing, I can see why he'd have good reason to be upset with you for grading him poorly.

Wait, he went through proxies even though you know him in real life? How does that even work? Is he afraid you are going to hack into his computer and make his desktop background ASCII art or something else equally threatening?

Good thing you were just grading him on English and not logic; I get the feeling that his grade is low enough as it is.
