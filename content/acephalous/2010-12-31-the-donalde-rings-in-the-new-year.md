...[by encouraging people to commit crimes](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/12/hating-scott-eric-kaufman-closing-out.html):

> Keep those cards and letters (and fake Craigslist listings) flowing!

He claims that the fact that [I taught a college freshmen who is currently projecting his or her issues onto me](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/12/important-facts-about-scott-eric-kaufman.html) reflects my abilities as a teacher, and then includes my name in the  title of his post in a deliberate attempt to undo the good deed I  attempted to do -- which was to make it possible for people who were  contacted by the person committing identity fraud to discover the fact  that I wasn't the one who contacted them before, as happened earlier  this week, _that person takes a day off work in order to meet "me" so "I" could inspect the truck "I" expressed interest in buying._ 

The Donalde, it follows, hates working class people who are trying to sell their trucks to make ends meet.  He sincerely hopes men whose trucks I have no interest in buying  continue to risk their jobs by taking days off to meet me.  For the sake  of all working class people, I sincerely hope his plan fails and that  people find my post before they risk losing their jobs.

Keep those cards and letters (and fake Craigslist listings) flowing!

Well, we knew he was ethically bereft before, but this is sociopathic. Also illiterate: it was fake _responses_ not fake listings.

Isn't he a professor too?  What would his response be if a student started smearing his name that way?

@Ahistoricality: No doubt.  That said, not that he knew this, but there were both fake responses and fake listings.  I just didn't discuss the latter in the post, which makes me wonder ...

@N.C.: No student of his would, because he's the perfect professor.  He's never, because of his godly pedagogy, had a freshmen who wasn't quite prepared for college and freaked out and did something untoward, such as ... this.

What. An. A\*shole.

I mean, holy crap, what kind of an sociopath to you have to be to be unable to make the distinction between, say, disagreeing on the amount of social services the state should provide or the advisability of use of American force and between seeking to do actual real world harm to a person?

Seriously, what the eff?

Is there institutional jealousy involved as well?  (I say as a man who teaches at an unnamed state university whose prestige is decidedly... less than UC Irvine's.)
