## Why must Fantagraphics books self-destruct?

I've purchased quite a bit of [Jason](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)s%!F(MISSING)ie%!D(MISSING)UTF8%!x(MISSING)%!D(MISSING)0%!r(MISSING)ef\_%!D(MISSING)nb\_sb\_ss\_i\_0\_13%!f(MISSING)sc%!D(MISSING)9%!i(MISSING)h%!D(MISSING)5\_6\_0\_2\_0\_0\_0\_1\_0\_1.95\_76%!y(MISSING)%!D(MISSING)0%!f(MISSING)ield-keywords%!D(MISSING)i%!k(MISSING)illed%!a(MISSING)dolf%!h(MISSING)itler%!u(MISSING)rl%!D(MISSING)search-alias%!D(MISSING)aps%!s(MISSING)prefix%!D(MISSING)i%!k(MISSING)illed%!a(MISSING)dol&tag=diesekoschmar-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957)![image](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) lately, and while I'm absolutely in love with the _work_, I can't say I'm impressed by the _texts_.  Books should be rereadable, but Fantagraphics' editions of Jason's work explode upon reading.  If__ you pick one up after having read it, the binding will release the pages from their commitment to the book and allow them to form a new one with a pile on the floor.  Scattered thus, they make for a far less compelling narrative ... but they are much easier to scan.  Might this analog bug be a digital feature?  (Most likely not.)

**UPDATE:** [Talk about service](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/08/why-must-fantagraphics-books-selfdestruct.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef01348650430f970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01348650430f970c).  There's a reason I love this press.
