Some European [arteeeeeeeeeeeests](http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%!A(MISSING)en-US%!A(MISSING)official&hs=k0g&q=arteeeeeeeeeeeests&btnG=Search)\* are [spanning the globe in search of me](http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2008/03/this\_is\_a\_game\_no\_really\_it\_is\_1.html).  They've dispatched agents to [_the Bahamas_](http://www.travelblog.org/Central-America-Caribbean/Bahamas/Nassau/blog-259665.html) thinking I'll be there.  

I won't be.

I'll be here ... unless they _want_ to find me in the Bahamas, in which case, I'm happy to oblige **_FOR THE LOW LOW [PRICE OF $3,500](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/03/the-secret-orig.html).  GET ME WHILE I LAST_!  _SUPPLIES ARE LIMITED AND I'M GOING FAST_!**

\*If you've ever wondered how many mocking e's you'd need to add to "arteest" before Google widowed, now you know.
