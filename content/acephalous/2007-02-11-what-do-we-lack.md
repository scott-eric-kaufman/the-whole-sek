## What Do We Lack?

Dialectical pluralism, which W.J.T. Mitchell defines as
the weeding out of error, the elimination of trivial or marginal contentions, and the clarification of fundamental and irreducible differences ... the kind of communication which clarifies exactly what is at stake in any critical conflict.

We need more of that, less arguing about first principles and the like.  

THIS HAS BEEN ANOTHER VERY BORING POST BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE GOOD PEOPLE OF _A.B.D. PANIC_, WHO REMIND YOU THAT ONLY ONE FIRM'S BEEN UNDERMINING FRIENDSHIPS, RELATIONSHIPS, AND LAST VESTIGES OF SELF-WORTH FOR OVER 70 YEARS.  SO THE NEXT TIME YOU NEED SOMEONE TO OFF HIMSELF, REMEMBER _A.B.D. PANIC:_ WE'RE HERE WHEN YOU NEED US (SO LONG AS HE ISN'T).

I'm potentially in favor of this claim, but it would help very much to know _where_ this is lacking.

_ABD Panic_ does a side business in hilarious.

Deep in our hearts, Joe, deep in our hearts.

Inasmuch as my dissertation engaged in biography, it focused on the life and work of Mortimer J. Adler.  Adler tried to accomplish, with his Institute for Philsophical Research (IPR), what W.J.T. Mitchell described.  The work of IPR resulted in books called "The Idea of Freedom," "The Idea of Justice," etc.  Those books approached larger ideas (the 'great ideas' if you will) and tried to translate the terms of various authors such that agreements and disagreements about particular propositions could be clearly discerned. The reception by professionals, especially of the first two-volume work, "The Idea of Freedom," was good.

SEK:  What made you highlight Mitchell's statement for us?  About what big idea do you desire dialectical clarity? - TL

Tim, I'm highlighting this notion because it's an idea which has, if you can believe it, fallen out of favor in English departments.  That bit's from 1982, and as a foundational principle, guaranteed that certain statements would receive the critique they deserved.  There's no such check anymore.  I'm not sure how to say this quickly -- i.e. without recapitulating the entire argument of the essay I cite Mitchell in -- but when theory "won," historicism took over, but it did so by uncritically integrating certain theoretical ideas.  People accept them and move along to their historical work, which is, to my mind (and Mitchell's, and Adler's, it seems), exactly the wrong step.  We should talk about theory _more_, not less, and in a more sophisticated fashion than we currently do.
