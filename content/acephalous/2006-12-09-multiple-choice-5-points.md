Seriously, if you're just going to refer to it in passing, "The Spanish-American War," with maybe an asterisk for completists explaining the other dimensions of the conflict.  (Anyway, the beginning of the U.S.-Philippine War [is usually put in 1899](http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/linphi.html).)  

If you're going to discuss it at some length, you can justify the longer name, I think.

eb, you caught my quick correction there, I see.  I don't know why I'd written 1893.  I'd only spent _all day_ working on that chapter. 

Karl, does that mean I can refer to Roosevelt as an Agent of S.A.W.?

But Adam, what would I call the French and Indian War then?  

slolernr, I think I am going to go the footnote route, mostly because Spanish-American-Cuban-Filipino War strikes me as inelegant.  ("Middle-Class White Male Hegemony: Eliding Your Existence in the Name of Elegance Since 
1893
 1898.")

When I had an undergraduate class in 20th Century American Foreign Policy the professor just referred to is as "The War of 1898". You could maybe try "American's First Imperial War" but there could be some debate about that...

Better that than [S.H.I.E.L.D.](http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/n/nickfury.htm)

_But Adam, what would I call the French and Indian War then?_

Just keep deferring, man.

How about calling it; "the 1898 conflict between Spain and the United States (often referred to as the 'Spanish-American War')?

This would be especially good if you:    

a) were being paid by the word  

b) needed/wanted/liked to boost word count for ego purposes or   

c) had difficulty making decisions generally and liked pleasing people via the deployment of lowest common denominator strategies.

Or you could just go with the Peoples' Judaean Front.

I think that in typical wingnut "every conflict in which the USA participates is a world war" style, you should call it World War N.  (N for nullae).  Then all previous wars could have negative numbers, meaning the French and Indian War would be written as World War -X or something.  That should mean that the Iraq War can be something funny, like World War XII.

  The only people I hate worse than the Romans are the Judean People's Front. It's the People's Front of Judea.
