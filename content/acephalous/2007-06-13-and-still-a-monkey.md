## And <em>Still</em> a Monkey!

As I watched the Mets lose to the Dodgers yesterday, I noticed that the one-of-a-kind, deservedly beloved [Vin Scully](http://www.salon.com/people/bc/1999/10/12/scully/) repeated the same story he first told (and I [first wrote about](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/the\_commonplace\_2.html)) on [6 June 2006](http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/wrap.jsp?ymd=20060606&content\_id=1492177&vkey=wrapup2005&fext=.jsp&c\_id=mlb) ... for the second night in a row.  I told myself I would _not_ repost the story—recounted almost word-for-word—unless he repeated it again tonight.  Well ...  

So
[Carlos](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?statsId=6132) bought a monkey.  He brought it down and let everyone see it. 
Everyone loved the monkey.  When he got back to Puerto Rico he talked
his famous neighbor [Chi Chi](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671892479?ie=UTF8&tag=diesekoschmar-20&link\_code=em1&camp=212341&creative=380425&creativeASIN=0671892479&adid=81aa9a58-88b4-4a26-8bdc-770284d46383)
into getting a monkey too.  Being a serious and studious man, Carlos
read all he could about monkeys.  He learned that they live to be 45
years old.  He thought "That's quite a commitment to make to a
monkey."  So when he got back to the States he sold the monkey.  This
isn't a children's story, kids.  He sold the monkey.

He should have gotten a guinea pig instead.  Much easier to take care of, and can be eaten in case of emergency.  But its difficult to train them to be helper-pigs.

I knew I should have sold the kids when they were still cute and small enough to bring a good price.
