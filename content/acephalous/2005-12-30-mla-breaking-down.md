For the first time since the convention started, I returned to my hotel room at a decent hour: 11:45 p.m.   I had a sore throat from shouting over the din in countless smoke-filled cash-bars . . . or so I thought.  Those who live quiet lives should not travel across the country and pretend they're Hunter S. Thompson and not expect dire fucking consequences.  

Around 3 a.m. I awoke shaking with a bone-chill four layers of sweaters and a heater could not kill.  I took some Tylenol and stopped shaking . . . but I suspect my body had some threshold which I unwittingly crossed yesterday.  I don't think I'm actually ill so much as toast.  So unless the fifteen gallons of water I've imbibed have magical restorative powers, I will only venture to Brian Thill's panel today.  (Otherwise I would have to admit I wasted valuable suitcase space on a [giant foam finger](http://www.tripaw.com/images/merchs36.jpg).)

UPDATE: A couple more hours of sleep and I'm young and alive again!  Best.  Flu-like.  Symptoms.  Ever.
