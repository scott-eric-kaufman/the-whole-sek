## I Write like Mullets; or, this Post is not about Fish ...

... but [it could've been](http://www.molecularevolution.org/mbl/resources/amphioxus/).\*  (Consider your blessings counted.)

This post is about 19th Century hubris.  The following was written about somebody:
He was a tolerably good observer and compiler, and surpassed ordinary men, perhaps, in ability to embody in words the results of his observations of various disconnected facts.

Name!  That!  Tolerably-Good-Observer!

I also could've written about Darwin's cheeky marginalia, of which I've enjoyed quite more than I can bear today.  That post _would_ have been about fishes, and would've included this excerpt from G.R. Waterhouse's 9 August 1843 letter to Darwin:

But as the term "natural" certainly has a very vague meaning when thus used, I have no objection to apply the word "_useful_" instead—But as the word natural for a kind of classification I merely follow others—it is no doubt presumptuous.

Darwin's response?

However different another sex or larva is we call it one species, when we know descent.—When we do not hesitate to call [Amphioxus](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/03/you-people-suck.html) Fish.—

Young Charles is perturbed.  (In my first draft he was "upset," then I remembered he was English.)  Amphioxus is _not_ a fish.  Don't believe me?  Ask my pretentious dissertation:

To [Paulina’s question](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/07/simple-question.html)—"Is it a fish?"—[T.H.] Huxley would answer that as "it conforms to the Vertebrate type ... I can see no reason for removing it from the class Pisces."  But conformation to the vertebrate _type_ is different from being, in an ontological sense, a vertebrate, as Huxley everywhere admits in his proposal.  He enumerates the structures in the amphioxus homologous, not identical, to those in vertebrates.  His identification here is typical: "that part of the cerebro-spinal axis of Amphioxus which lies in front of the seventh myotome answers to the preauditory part of the brain in the higher Vertebrata, and the corresponding part of the head to the trabecular region of the skull in them."  The presence of these homologues in the amphioxus is certainly significant—it demonstrates that the animal is related to the progenitor of what Ernst Haeckel [elsewhere] called "the whole stem"—but it does not warrant its inclusion in the stem itself, and as Wharton knew, there is a fundamental problem with any classificatory system which would include the amphioxus among the class Pisces.

All this almost-but-not-quite-a-fish-talk titillates, doesn't it?

It doesn't?  I expect you'll complain about the post-to-footnote ratio too now.  As much as I'd like to put the bulk of my prose in the body of what I write, I can't help but live in the footnotes.  My body graphs uniformly fail to inspire, but that's only because I write like mullets: business up front, party in the rear!  

(Make of that what you will.)

(Only not _too_ much.  This is a family blog.)

You make my head hurt. But since I've been drinking large amounts of wine and watching art films with friends, that's not very hard to do.

On the other hand, it seems you are bulking up your dissertation with fish instead of funyuns, which is all to the good; more omega 3s, less trans fats. Your diss may have shelf life problems, but at least it won't give you heart disease. 

I'm hoping to lull my dissertation into sleep so that I can sneak away from it without being mauled. Wish me luck! And same for you...

That discussion seems astonishingly modern given that it's 16 years before the _Origin of Species_. The same question -- is the species to hand a member of the crown group, or a closely related stem group? -- remains a staple of systematics papers today; and the extent to which a taxonomy can be both "natural" or "useful" is still a point of dispute.

(The biological concept of "fish" turned out to be useful, but not natural.)

English people get upset too, you know.  I'm upset that you think I don't get upset.  My set is up, I can assure you.

GDR, apparently you're not up to speed on your [baraminology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baraminology).

(Hmm, I wonder what traffic _that_ link will bring to your site...I know this much: at least it won't be the Hello Kitty sort of riff-raff).

I'm going to assume that the "tolerably good observer" was Darwin....

If a dissertation is like a fish, it's like lutefisk: artificial, toxic, but filling a very particular need in a harsh environment. If the dissertation writer is like a fish, it is those unfortunate fish who are served whole a sushi restaraunts, their heads gasping for air and muscles still twitching as soy sauce mimics neurotransmitters.....

a dissertation isn't like fugu, then? And the diss writer like Homer Simpson thinking he'd been poisoned by the fugu fish and had 24 hours to live?

Scott, did you know they've named a [currency]() in Sweden after you?  I think you're now obligated to do some lutefisk blogging or something.  First the currency, next the Nobel Prize!
