			Dear Dr. PLEASE LOVE ME PLEASE,

I am writing to apply for the position of Associate Professor of AWESOME.  I completed my Ph.D. in AWESOME at the University of California, AWESOME, where I specialized in AWESOME and AWESOMER.  In addition to pursuing my interests in AWESOMENESS—the generic history of AWESOMER and AWESOMEST and the historical development of AWESOMOSITY—during my tenure at UC AWESOME, I cultivated other AWESOME interests that, over time, became EVEN AWESOMER.  Early in my graduate career, I helped develop the AWESOME curriculum for the AWESOMEST undergraduate program in the UC system; more recently, my course director, Dr. AWESOME, invited me to coauthor a manuscript on AWESOME rhetoric for AWESOME Press.  My effort to share, by teaching AWESOMELY, the complexities of an AWESOME discipline in an AWESOME manner dovetails with my desire to provide, by teaching EVEN MORE AWESOMELY, the critical tools required to understand an increasingly AWESOME world.  Together, they point to my AWESOME commitment to the improvement of AWESOMENESS.

Yup. It's like that. 

And I hope that _lots of people will be reading your letter_ and be impressed by its awesomeness very soon.

If I use this as the template for all of my future cover letters, will that mean you are the source of the new plagiarism?

What's worse, this is how cover letters actually read, too.

Eh - why not give it a try?  The HR people are always saying that no one gives a shit what's in the cover letter, it just needs to get you interested in the candidate.  It could work. (which would truly be awesome)

Barnone, that's the point.  You're not allowed to be humble.  It goes against every self-effecing tendency that academia has bred in you, but you have to proclaim your awesomeness in the hope that someone will find you adequate.

Of course this is even worse with real world cover letters.  David Rakoff has a great line about the challenges of learning that, in job interviews, a tone of cheerful can-do mania is not just an asset, but actually required.

You should see the bizarre cover letters (some) wannabe writers send along with their manuscripts to mass market publishers.  There are a lot more lunatics.  Not to mention the people who include gifts, or package their ms. in elaborate carved boxes, or otherwise reveal their insanity and/or cluelessness.
