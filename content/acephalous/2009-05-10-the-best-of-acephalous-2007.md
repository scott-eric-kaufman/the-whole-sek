have doubts about the declining standards of the National Guard. Yes,
we hit the enrollment targets, sure. But with what sort of men? A guy
so inordinately proud of his chest bush that he refused to wear his
fatigues, an ape from the San Diego zoo, a Star Wars nut who was scared
to appear in public without his R2D2 getup, and an illegal Mexican
wrestler who went by 'el vaquero secreto'? It was, in short, the moment
when I should have known that _les jeux sont faits_. We were well and
truly fucked." [via [CR](http://adswithoutproducts.typepad.com/)]

The third installment wasn't divided by months.  This one is because I'd half-finished a version of it earlier and besides variety is the spice of life.  There's also some overlap with the second installment here, because I wasn't organizing by years the first two times.  I'll sort it all out soon enough though.  (Also, you may notice some slight alterations on the posts linked in the "Best of" series.  That's because I figure these are the ones strangers will read and I want to make sure they don't mistake me for an Yglesias or a Klein.)

If nothing else I learned two things from this. One, that you're a Springsteen fanboy (good) and two, you're two years younger than me (less good).
