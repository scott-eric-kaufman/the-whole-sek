So, that dell coupon didn't work out quite as well as you thought?

Buy a Mac. You know you want it. Isn't it pretty?

Macs crash too.  They just don't give you an error message.

Rich is being facetious.  This is exactly why you don't want an error message.  (Though my experience w/ the temp. Vista system is making me rethink my level of frustration w/ Macs.  Though on the other hand the problems r probably fr having both new hw & new sw.)

Macs and Windows of all variety suck. Use Ubuntu Linux. Load it onto the same machine you've been using. Trust me, you'll never miss that proprietary, expensive garbage.

Sometimes you want an error message and sometimes you don't.  In any case, in the battle of crash-prone-ness between Windows and OS X, Windows is probably still ahead, but not by as much as most people think.  Also, OS X simply does not have as much good, free software as Windows does.  (It doesn't have as many viruses either, though.)

Apple does make far better hardware than any PC maker that I know of, however, although it is more pricey.  I gave up on PC hardware because of the decibel level of the cooling fans that they use.  For some reason, Apple knows how to make an almost completely silent, thin machine, and PC makers don't.

One of these days I'm going to try Ubuntu on my Mac hardware.  Having used Linux servers for more than a decade, though, I associate it with system administration.

disassociate it then! With your politics, Rich, I'm surprised you're not into the free (as in beer & speech) software movement. You want good free software? Sheesh! 

I recommend Ubuntu for ease of use. I'm not really a computer person, but I find Ubuntu very simple and fun to use (whereas the October 2005 release, which is what I started with, cost me hours and hours of wrangling).

Hmmm. That looks disturbingly like Vista. 

Wait, VISTA?? SEK, are you crazy?? 

Until the place where I work (with thousands of desktops and laptops) decides to ditch XP for Vista, I'm not going to go there. Longtime Windoze users complain about it loudly. Vista, the new Microshaft cuss word. Of course, I would venture that it probably came with Vista. JOY (or, you know, NOT). If you had a choice and did not choose XP, then, I hate to be cruel; however, that statue lacks a head because???
