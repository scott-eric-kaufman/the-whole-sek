## On Fincholars & The Frequent Object of Their Discontents

I admit to having been surprised by the [initial](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/on/#8774) [responses](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/on/#8778) to a post in which I compared myself to a shrill bird angered by the inability of a nut to understand the constructedness of its "essential" characteristics.  I felt better after seeing that [Amardeep](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/on/#8798) recognized the novelty of the idea: it can works both as a critique and defense of literary jargon depending on the mood you're in.  It speaks to the necessary imperfection of thought at any particular historical moment, but only inasmuch as any evolving beast is imperfectly adapted to its environment.  There's no value judgment there.  Only a simple statement of fact.  If a single thought could explain the world in all its complexities, there'd be no need to think anymore.  The inability of any particular species of fincholars to crack the nut speaks to the uncrackability of the nut, not the uncrackingability of the fincholar.  (Perhaps this is evidence that the [same rules apply](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/what\_only\_the\_h.html#comments) to gentle self-mockery as to [biting sarcasm](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/what\_only\_the\_h.html).)

Finally: Holbo [could've typed this sentence](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2006/04/travel\_broadens.html).  He didn't.  Because he's sound asleep.  _At 5 p.m._  All those people who harbor the belief he doesn't actually read the works of theory he attacks are absolutely correct.  No way he can sleep this much _and_ generate Holbonic posts _and_ read the objects of said posts.  (Although he did read a large chunk of [this little book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0804747377/diesekoschmar-20) today.)

Unfortunately, any discussion of jargon is contingent on whether people recognize that theory jargon is a problem. I don't know that everyone is on the same page about that (or perhaps I should say, the episteme is always-already anti-non-indeterminate).

In your post's case, success is also contingent on whether participants are willing to allow a sense of humor into the discussion. Clearly, two readers at least were not: either talk about the subject in exactly the mold specified, or it doesn't "count." 

I recognize that there may be different ways of viewing jargon, but I don't know why humor must be banished. Wasn't [Diogenes](http://www.benbest.com/philo/diogenes.html) also a theorist?

Scott's post appeared the same day a post at Crooked Timber compared Derrida and Butler to Hitler and Tojo (hahaha!) and the same day that I learned the Australian PM commented on "Theory" (hahahaha!). And, no, I don't think jargon is a problem and because The Valve of common sense always decides the terms of these debates I'm going to have to call vocab jargon (surely you wouldn't call other fields technical language jargon). So sorry I missed the joke, but people really are calling for the destruction of things I care about (even if they have to hide and do shitty work in literature departments - trust me, I would prefer they weren't in literature departments).

Wow, I was wondering when a post at Crooked Timber compared Derrida to Hitler.  The only post anywhere near the same timeframe as Scott's post was [this](http://crookedtimber.org/2006/04/18/baroque-specialization-and-the-irresponsibility-of-analytical-philosophers/), which does indeed have -- a commenter named [rea](http://crookedtimber.org/2006/04/18/baroque-specialization-and-the-irresponsibility-of-analytical-philosophers/#comment-152251) writing that, with a smiley.  Hahaha indeed!

Since Scott is in a literature department and wants to be, I wonder whether he has the same sympathy for these refugees who would rather be doing something else but have been forced to be there by a cruel, cruel world.

First, I don't think "jargon" a term of actual opprobrium.  It speaks to the inclusiveness of the speech in question, but not to its character.  

Jargon = Argot = ? 

So yes, I'd call philosophic jargon a jargon, same with engineering, computer science, &c.  (Also, as a general rule, I have no pity for the tenured.)

OH, Jesus [deleted] Mary and Joseph - SORRY. A _commenter_ at Crooked Timber compared Derrida and Bulter to standing up against Hitler and Tojo. A comment completely in the spirit of the lame-ass post it was commenting on.

[This](http://www.long-sunday.net/long\_sunday/2006/04/circulation\_spi.html#c16481167) seems rather apropos.

And by "this" I do mean the Shaviro link.  It's pretty much a no-brainer, really.

Which may, admittedly, surprise some people accustomed to scoring points by grandstanding their wholesale criticisms of "jargon" who thought they possessed something like a brain.

Of course there is both good and bad jargon still, like everything.  But "jargon" itself is not a problem, or at least the criticism demands to be qualified (jargon for jargon's sake is another matter, and harder to assess - for instance, one needs to know the jargon).  

Bottom line:  there's no criticizing jargon unless you understand the jargon.  FFS.
