[![MISSING KITTEN](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f244c036970b-500wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f244c036970b-popup)   
 However, creepy as that unintentionally was, success did follow.  Yesterday afternoon, I made a small child cry when I informed her that I knew where her kitten was ... under my barbecue grill.  Which is also plenty creepy, I am aware.

You need to send your life story to Larry David. He can make you a star!
