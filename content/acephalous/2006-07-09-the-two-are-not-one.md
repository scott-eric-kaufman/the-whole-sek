In “The End of the Poststructuralist Era,” from [_Follies of the Wise_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1593761015/diesekoschmar-20),
Frederick Crews charts the hasty marriage and slow estrangement of
poststructuralist thought and New Left activism.  His argument, and its
implications, may surprise you.

You see, the Yale School of deconstruction’s “manifest aim was ...
to bring a spirit of erudite whimsy into the discussion of familiar
[canonical] books, which would be rendered only more endearing by the
discovery that their meanings were more multitudinous and undecidable
than anyone had yet surmised” (308).  Too true, too true.  

Only, why would the discovery of even “more multitudinous and
undecidable” dimensions to canonical literature open up the canon to
previously marginalized voices?  Wouldn’t deconstruction have _the opposite_ effect?  Hillis, speaking here in his 1986 presidential address, certainly thought so:

As everyone knows, literary study in the past few years
has undergone a sudden, almost universal turn away from theory in the
ordinary sense of an orientation toward language as such and has made a
corresponding turn toward history, culture, society, politics,
institutions, class and gender conditions. (283)

Color me confused.  Here I thought theory necessarily entailed the
commitments it so recently acquired.  Here I thought older modes of
criticism possessed the retrograde politics.  Here I thought a lot of
things a little historical perspective shattered.  Why?  Because the
explanations were conceptual.  

Because they’re _always_ conceptual.  

Poststructuralist thought _always_ allies itself with a progressive politics, and poststructuralist thinkers _always_
fold the latter into the former.  The result?  Opposition to
poststructuralist thought necessarily entails an opposition to the
progressiveness of its immanent politics.  Now I can complain that
those politics aren’t immanent, that no textual orientation contains an
immanent politics, but I will be shouted down by those who experience _as natural_
their political and theoretical commitments, who cannot disentangle
them because, well, because no one can offer a convincing reason that
they should.

For the better part of two decades, literary critics have used a
poststructuralist theoretical approach to generate a body of
progressive thought, so _of course_
the two appear inseparable.  Factor in the overwhelming number of
conservative critics who fancy themselves poststructuralists, then
think about it:

If everyone who does what they do shares the same politics, and
everyone who doesn’t, doesn’t, why would they question a connection
that feels so natural to them?  They have no reason to.  

So they haven’t.  I have, but from the wrong direction.  I started in
the ‘70s moving forward, from the moment when the former radicals
gained purchase in the discipline.  All this time, I should have been
looking at it from the other direction, from the ‘80s moving
backwards.  To point out, as Hillis does above, that “theory in the
ordinary sense” existed independently of the commitments it eventually
acquired.

Conceptual arguments _be damned_, I say, I have _history_.  The two are _not_ one, not naturally.  They may be one of [this lot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium\_%!P(MISSING)lato%!#(MISSING)Aristophanes), but more than likely not.  Just a simple couple whose marriage, while productive, is neither permanent nor necessary.

This being, as I hope is obvious, a criticism of neither, only of the connection frequently made between them and the implications thereof.

I'm going to have to read that book. The idea that any body of thought at all secures its own radicality is a dumb, and sometimes dangerous, error. I went to a conference once, held by the Radical Philosophy Association. It was a good time. Lots of other commies who really like books, and many similar books. But it's really easy to deceive oneself, as if "I have far left beliefs" means "what I do is of or for or a contribution to the far left". The conference would have been better called "Radicals Who Make Excessive Detours Through Philosophy", that would have been more honest and could have helpd some folk accomplish the working through they were engaged in. So yeah, post-structural lit crit as radical? And to be blunt, campus politics in general? I mean ... really, come on. Not to say it's without value, but the pose of being really far left, on the side of the angels and all that. A bit self-serving, you know?
