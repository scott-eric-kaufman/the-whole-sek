			**GUY AT SEK’S DOOR:** Hey friend, it’s windy, ain’t it?

**SEK:** I guess.

**GUY AT SEK’S DOOR:** Mind if I park in your driveway?

**SEK:** A little. I might need to use it.

**GUY AT SEK’S DOOR:** Thanks, I’ll just be a while.

**SEK:** I didn’t say “Yes.”

**GUY AT SEK’S DOOR:** You want me to park in the street?

**SEK:** It’s not a heavily trafficked road.

**GUY AT SEK’S DOOR:** It’ll just be a while. I won’t block you in.

**SEK:** You will, in fact, be blocking me in. And what happens when my wife gets home?

**GUY AT SEK’S DOOR:** Can’t she park on the street?

_The head SEK doesn’t have explodes._ 

_Finis._
