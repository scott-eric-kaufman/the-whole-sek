I can kind of see what he means by this. For even with all the writing techniques as far as the descriptive language, perfectly structured sentences, quotations, etc. you can never really see, smell, taste, touch, or hear the things that are  being written about so it takes away from the information. Granted some people do an amazing job at this, but still the information is destroyed when they put their own twists on the information and incorporate their opinion into it. So yes I agree, even though I love writing, writing does destroy information.
