To the thems who have searched for me by name a couple hundred times
this week . . . I have an email address.  You can send messages to me
through it at your convenience.  If truncating ".typepad.com/" from
"acephalous.typepad.com/" and adding an "@gmail.com" to the untruncated
part confounds you, well, better you don't email me, since my general state of confusion
will only confound you further.  (Really, if y'all ain't smarter than me,
don't bother talking to me.  I'm here for learning but ain't too quick
with the listening and what it entrails.)  If that ain't the devil's own asshole and you think you know me, there's always contact option hombre dos: squash my names together and paste an "@gmail.com" to it.  That'll reach me.  (Yes I speak Spanish fluently . . . so long as I'm not alone and without my "dictionary.")

So it has been a strange week around here.  I have a full schedule of off-quarter blogging planned, including but not limited to 1) periodic updates on the dissertation chapters you all click click click to read more about and 2) SUPREMELY AWESOME ALL-CAPS COVERAGE OF THE MLA IN HDTV!  (Less than half of that speaks Truth to Power . . . mostly it whispers Rumors to Giant Egregious Lies.  But "seriously," I have three buckets of Krazy Glue and I fully intend on [still staying stuck](http://www.krazyglue.com/) to everyone I meet who has a Kareer.  [Krikey](http://www.crikey.com.au/)!  It ain't like I have a choice in the matter.)
