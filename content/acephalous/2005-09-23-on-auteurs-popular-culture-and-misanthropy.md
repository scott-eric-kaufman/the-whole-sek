## On Auteurs, Popular Culture and Misanthropy

The expansive wasteland of American popular entertainment is either less expansive or more densely populated than usual at the moment.  The hostility Hollywood exhibited toward the auteurs of American cinema in the Seventies has withered as the quality of their films has declined.  (Only Scorsese thinks big any longer.)  Over a two month period the major studios will have released:

*   [_Lord of War_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0399295/), penned and directed by the both over- ([_S1m0ne_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0258153/))  and under- rated ([_Gattaca_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0119177/)) New Zealand-born Andrew Niccol
*   [_The 40 Year Old Virgin_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0405422/), by Judd Apatow, the man responsible for the sublime (but short-lived) [_Freaks and Geeks_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0193676/)
*   [_The Constant Gardener_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0387131/), Fernando Meirelles' follow-up to his brilliant [_City of God_](http://imdb.com/name/nm0576987/)
*   [_A History of Violence_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0399146/), the latest by David Cronenberg
*   [_Oliver Twist_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0380599/), the latest by Roman Polanski
*   [_Serenity_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0379786/), Joss Whedon's feature-length adaptation of the cancelled (but critically acclaimed) television show [_Firefly_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0303461/)

All these films share one common element: they exist only because their directors have clout enough to flip the finger at the contemporary Hollywood system.  The steady decline in box office tallies has created a class of directors who, while producing nothing so sublime as Copolla's [_The Conversation_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0071360/), will produce the most impressive August and September in recent memory.  Their films may suffer beside qualitative heights of the auteur era, but the quantitative breadth of quality films they've pushed into American theaters is an equally impressive feat.  For the first time in ages the question isn't "Which one will insult my intelligence the least?" but "Which one do I want to see most?"  I haven't had the opportunity to ask that question in quite some time.  And did I mention television?  

Despite Whedon's absence, the major networks have managed to field quite an interesting lineup this year: 

*   J.J. Abrams' _[Alias](http://imdb.com/title/tt0285333/)_ continues on fumes, but _[Lost](http://imdb.com/title/tt0411008/)_ is (deservedly) a powerhouse.
*   Fox has forgotten to cancel _[Arrested Development](http://imdb.com/title/tt0367279/)_ for the third straight season.
*   Shaun Cassidy returns to television (ten years after the cancellation of [_American Gothic_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0111880/)) with the intelligent and disturbingly timely _[Invasion](http://imdb.com/title/tt0460651/)._
*   Ricky Gervais' _[Extras](http://imdb.com/title/tt0445114/)_ is set to debut on HBO (as are the fifth season of [_Curb Your Enthusiasm_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0264235/) and the third season of [_Deadwood_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0348914/)).
*   No one informed Glen Larson the original _[Battlestar Galactica](http://imdb.com/title/tt0407362/)_ sucked.

Given all this quality entertainment out there, you may be thinking "Scott _claims_ to be dissertating but he seems to spend an inordinate amount of time watching films and television."  Had I a social life which consisted in more than dissertating all day, pouring myself a drink and collapsing on the couch, your suspicions would be justified.  But I don't.  So they aren't.  Someone once told me "The key to a long academic career is create the appearance of responsibility while behaving irresponsibly."  He neglected to mention that an absolute misanthrope need not keep up appearances.  One _can_ be both.

I realize this is somewhat belated commentary, but since I'm not commenting on the contemporary stuff it doesn't seem to matter. I'm just glad to see someone else who appreciates _The Conversation_ - after stumbling on it accidentally on AMC one afternoon, I was so taken aback I looked it up online and was surprised to find mixed reviews. Also, that it apparently lost to _Godfather 2_ for Best Picture that year. (In the interests of disclosure, no, I haven't actually seen G2 - or any of the Godfather movies for that matter.)

If you liked _The Conversation_, Tony, you should check up on _The Godfather_ -- the first two parts at least.  As for it winning out over _The Conversation_, Coppola was competing against himself, and the thought was that they were rewarding him for both films.  (Again, can you imagine someone producing not one, but TWO films of such quality in the same year anymore?  The closest we'll come is _Knocked Up_ and _Superbad_, but that ain't quite the same.)
