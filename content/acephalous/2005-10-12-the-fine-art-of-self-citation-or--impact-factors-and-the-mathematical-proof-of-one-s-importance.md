But the policy has done just that, and quite successfully, according to the _The Chronicle'_s analysis of self-citations to one-year-old articles — which are important in the impact calculation. In 1997 the _Journal of Applied Ecology_
cited its own one-year-old articles 30 times. By 2004 that number had
grown to 91 citations, a 200-percent increase.

Therefore, it shouldn't be unethical for a blogger to puff his (now ostentatiously) humble chest.  Surely nothing I say ranks in importance anywhere near anything published in _The New England Journal of Medicine_, the _Annual Review of Immunology_ or the _Cancer Journal for Clinicians_.  And yet all of those publications feel the need to inflate their patent importance by citing recently published articles again and again and again and again.  With importance being predicated on the appearance of importance, why worry about the ethical dilemma of choking off the availability of vital—_literally_ "vital," as in the Latin _vita_, meaning "life"—research in a library which subscribes to journals based on their "impact factor."  An important journal of cardiology, one keyed to specialists, may not be available in a _research_ library because its impact factor ranks far below that of the specialist journals.  [Update: Stephen Karlson pushes this logic a little further [here](http://coldspringshops.blogspot.com/2005\_10\_01\_coldspringshops\_archive.html#112909165446622468).]  

From whence does my righteous indignation against the high impact factor generalist journal spring?  I'm not sure.  But my life _would_ be easier if UCI subscribed to the _[Jack London Journal](http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/London/Organizations/jljournal.html)_.
