## How to Open an Academic Essay, Part IV: The Self-Aggrandizing Personal Anecdote

The majority of Americans laugh at the Academy.  "You think you're so important," they say once they can catch their breath.

To counter this and similar withering denunciations, many academics fluff up their introductions with the Self-Aggrandizing Personal Anecdote (SAPA).  Since the SAPA frequently involves the dropping of names known to no one outside the academy, institutions often bear the load.  For instance, in an essay entitled "_Mao II_ and the War on Terrorism," one SAP (Self-Aggrandizing Person) informs general and academic readers alike of his important contributions to the _New York Times_' coverage of September 11th:
Shortly after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center towers
and the Pentagon and the crash of hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 on
September 11, 2001, I received a call from a reporter at the _New York
Times_. Emily Eakin was working on a story about modern literature's
response to earlier forms of terror, in particular the fictional
representations of Russian revolutionaries in Fyodor Dostoevsky's _The
Possessed_ (1871–72) and European anarchists in Henry James's
_The Princess Casamassima_ (1886) and Joseph Conrad's _The Secret
Agent_ (1907). Eakin reasonably assumed that great literature offers us means of coping
with crises like September 11 and that this specific event was not
historically unique. We talked by phone and e-mail about the national
agendas of early modern revolutionary movements and the global terrorist
aims of the Islamic fundamentalist Al-Qaeda, including the aesthetic
means required to represent these different political cultures and
historical periods. Call Don DeLillo, I urged Eakin, and read _Mao
II_, his literary analysis of postmodern terrorism. Then call
Jody McAuliffe and Frank Lentricchia at Duke, who are producing
a dramatization of the novel in the spring of 2002. Eakin phoned
none of the above and certainly did not read _Mao II_ for her
story. Reporters have deadlines; her story appeared eleven days after
September 11.

In a single introductory paragraph, this SAP earns his name.  Through a personal anecdote readers learn that his name and number grace a card in one of the 4,397 rolodexes owned by people affiliated with _New York Times_; that he not only knows everything a person ought to know about forms of terrorism historical and contemporary; that he knows big shots like Frank Lentricchia and possesses inside information about upcoming theatrical performances of mediocre works of contemporary American literature; and finally, the reader learns how much better this SAP is than the one who called him for information on a topical news story because she didn't fulfill what this SAP, in the first sentence of the second paragraph, calls "the luxury and responsibility" of the scholar.  

Reading this SAP's introduction one would think Eakin didn't take any of his advice.  (One would also think this SAP consulted because of his expertise about "the aesthetic means required to represent these different political cultures and historical periods."  In her article, however, it's clear that Eakins consulted this SAP because, in her words, he's "a James scholar."  I'm sure our SAP meant to imply that instead of what he actually implied; then again, one of the virtues of being a SAP is never having to apologize for being a SAP.)  If you read Eakins' article, however, it becomes clear that not only did she not take his advice, she had the nerve to write the story _she'd been assigned to write_ instead of the one he suggested.  She lacked the requisite luxury and sense of responsibility and so instead of following this SAP's advice, she wrote an article about "the literary preoccupation with terrorism" that goes back "to at least the 1870's."  

In other words, the SAPA enables the run-of-the-mill SAP to appear extraordinary because the SAPA need not bear any relation to the SAP's actual achievements.  Drawbacks to the SAPA include 1) the easy availability of newspaper archives that discredit the SAP's aggrandizing claims, 2) the potential for readers to grasp with theretofore unknown profundity the disconnect between the SAP's evaluation of him or herself and the forum in which the SAP publishes, and 3) the jealous stares of friends and colleagues who can't build themselves up with such effortless regularity.

A dramatized version of Mao II?  The very idea makes me shudder.  Especially since all of DeLillo's dialogue sounds exactly the ^$^%!^(MISSING)##$ same.
