Scott, has it occurred to you that the economic meltdown and subsequent academic hiring freezes may all be the latest trial in God's seemingly endless attempt to screw with you?

In all seriousness, this sucks, plain and simple, and I feel terrible for you and everyone else on the market this year.  Hang in there.

Those of us who are doing searches are racing against the clock, trying to get them done and the paperwork signed by the administration before the penny drops on our budget cuts. It's like trying to pass on a two-lane highway: you see the truck coming the other way, but you really, really don't want to be behind the Ford Fairlane any longer than you already have, because it's going a lot slower than you need, so you pull out and gun it, but you know you might have to abort if you've misjudged anything....

OMG I should have known that going out on the market with you would result in catastrophe!

That doesn't explain my crappy showings the previous two years, however.

Sigh --- buy each other consolation drinks at MLA?

Hey, I just got one of those! For me, it does feel a little better after hearing "it's not you, it's your competition" 23 times...
