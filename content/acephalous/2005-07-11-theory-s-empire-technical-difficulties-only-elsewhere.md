So my boundless curiosity compelled me to discover what time it was in Singapore by changing my localization settings on [the Valve](http://www.thevalve.go/org/).  The unfortunate result of this?  Because I had set it to be posted on Tuesday at some obscene hour in the wee of the night in California, when I switched to Singapore time, I confused the "Expression Engine" and it posted my contribution then and there.  So, anyway, if you read me, why not read me there.  It's an excellent _essay--_yes, I said _essay_--on the history of post-structuralist thought and the limitations of Theory.  So go already.  It's there.  Read it.  

What?  You want a link?  [Here!](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/theorys\_empire\_ersatz\_theoretical\_ecumenicalism\_criticism\_qua\_criticism/)
