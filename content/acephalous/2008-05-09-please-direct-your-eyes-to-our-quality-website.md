[We really need the ad revenue](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7390109.stm).

(What?  The only alternative is that the BBC decided to fire its editors overnight.  Can you think of another scenario in which that slips through?)

Either they need the revenue or the web editor needs to be reassigned. ...Bird mouths don't immediately make be think of tits, so maybe it's okay. - TL

I tried to correct that "be" to "me," but it was too late. - TL

You do know that the Brits are a nation of twitchers, though, I hope?  This... complicates the picture somewhat.

Is it conceivable that for the British, the "naughty" senses of a word might not so fully overshadow the "clean" senses as they do for Americans?  Boring thought, I know; but as far as I know, a cock is still a cock there, and not a rooster.

You have the courage of your convictions more than I do.  I saw the headline, snickered, and said "nah, I shouldn't broadcast it to the world."

Sorry, I meant that a cock is a "cock" there, and not a "rooster".  HTH....

Some of the editors at the beeb do have this sort of sense of humour, as these type of headlines do pop up from time to time. I actually thought it was quite droll.

It's not about the adverts though, as the Beeb is not funded through advertising but is publically funded through television licenses. They aren't allowed to make money from advertising (or at least not in the UK- perhaps they can have adverts on the American feeds?).

Yeah, I think they do have ads when the site is viewed in the US. I think they hired a editor from The Sun for a day.

More inappropriate [BBC News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk\_politics/7358335.stm) headlines. Although at least they [didn't do this awful ad placement](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/12/telegraph\_burma/).
