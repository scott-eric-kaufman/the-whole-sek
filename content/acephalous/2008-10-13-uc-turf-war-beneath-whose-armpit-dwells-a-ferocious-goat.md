(_[x-posted](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/10/13/uc-turf-war-beneath-whose-armpit-dwells-a-ferocious-goat/)._)

So I avoided [these duties](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/10/13/the-dismal-science-is-that-much-more-dismal-today/#comment-23348) today by defending what I’d written [yesterday](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/10/12/who-really-wrote-obamas-dreams-from-my-father/) from [this](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13422).
I don’t know what to make of that—the anger spills from, well, I’m not
sure—but in the end, I’m blamed for present hate-mail from [_Atlantic_ readers](http://ta-nehisicoates.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/epic\_failayers\_ghostwrote\_obamas\_memoir.php) and future hate-mail from [_American Conservative_ readers](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13422#comment-560702). 
All because I considered Jeff Goldstein’s “disinterested” disquisition
on the relationship of ghostwriters to their subjects insufficiently
disinterested, what with it being a series of hypotheticals about Bill
Ayers ghostwriting Barack Obama’s autobiographies and all.

Why would I think Goldstein’s interests weren’t disinterested?  Probably because he’s been postulating [this here](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13401) and [that there](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13395)
about Ayers’ relation to Obama’s relation to Alinksy’s relation to the
New Left and all things radical.  Admittedly, in the post I linked
to—the disinterested “[What If…?](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/theory\_comics\_t.html)”
about Ayers ghostwriting Obama’s memoirs—Jeff didn’t speak directly to
his beliefs about Obama and the totalitarian state his victory will
usher in.

He spoke entirely hypothetically and disinterestedly about the sort of material James Olney wrote brilliantly about in [_Memory & Narrative_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226628175/diesekoschmar-20)—a
book I can’t recommend highly enough, for what it lacks in the
faux-theoretical sophistication of insecure blowhards it makes up with
genuine, old-school erudition—except unlike Olney, whose impetus was
either [Beckett or St. Augustine](http://books.google.com/books?id=LhNmX63PJvsC&dq=%!j(MISSING)ames+olney%!+(MISSING)%!m(MISSING)emory+and+narrative%!&(MISSING)pg=PP1&ots=g4GXR5HE2W&sig=RLtuoqJfMz0PHRj8pc-wnJpBBb0&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book\_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPA1,M1),
Jeff felt compelled to share his wholly and entirely disinterested
thoughts about life-writing after reading Cashill’s hackneyed “[analysis](http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=76731)” of Ayers and Obama’s memoirs.

What was I thinking, connecting what he’d been writing to months to
his totally disinterested post about life-writing that just so happened
to feature the same two figures who star in his drama of inevitable
American decline?  [I’m such a liar](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13422#comment-560707)
. . . but if you can bear with me for a moment, there’s a more
important topic at stake here.  Jeff’s commenters have sunk to a new
low:

Now they’re claiming [UCI is a community college](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13422#comment-561038). 
They’re making fun of the institution that made me a Doctor of
Philosophy of Literature, and I won’t stand for it.  I’m this close to
blowing all my gaskets and—

—what’s that you say?  UCI _isn’t_ the armpit of the UC system?  [_Davis_ is](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13422#comment-561073)?  I suppose my gaskets are safe then.  I can’t imagine anyone _here_ taking offense to _that_.

Lack of disinterest is the least of it. Here’s the core of this according to Jeff G:

“If the charges are true, and Obama’s memoirs were in fact written by Bill Ayers, at least in part, than it is clear that at least in part, Barack Obama is a creation of Bill Ayers, not with respect to the historical events of Obama’s life, but with respect to how those events are presented, and how the presentation itself speaks to the “person” doing the presenting.

On that meta level, “Obama,” as we’ve come to know him through his memoirs, is more Ayers than he is Obama. Because from the perspective of “literariness” (if such a thing can be said to exist), the presentation is equally as important as the presented.”

The rest of it is one long equivocation between “Obama” and Obama, spiced with a bit of pretense that the presented Obama consists mostly of this book and not almost wholly of campaign material, interviews, and so on.

But the basic premise is … what? Jeff G throws around words like “ontological”, but strangely enough, no other politician has ever before been defined by his ghostwriter. When people find out that a politician used a ghostwriter, they assume that the book therefore tells you \*less\* about the politician, who has hidden behind a sort of screen, not more. They don’t analyze the screen, which is assumed to present some sort of pleasant picture, as the key to the Real Truth about the pol, or even his image.

This goes beyond sloppiness or political interest, into laughable barking-mad incompetence. Really, you’ve gone easy on Jeff G.

So should you engage with him further? Don’t listen to ari or Vance or Walt or me, Scott.   

[Listen to the wise Jpool!](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/10/12/who-really-wrote-obamas-dreams-from-my-father/#comment-23247) — who was so upset that I might chide you for getting involved in yet another pointless engagement with these people that he pre-emptively chided me because he imagined that I would get on your case about it. (The reason I didn’t, by the way, is because your original post wasn’t full of proteinwisdom links. It’s worth shooting down a new wingnut story that’s coming out their propaganda caves, where their stories are created, even though their bloggers are best ignored.)

Not that I think that the Jpools of the world will change their minds, no matter how often they are proven wrong. But you don’t want to be one of them, do you, Scott? I mean, look at your track record with this kind of engagement.

I'm sure I'll be shot down for something or other, because it seems everyone in Blog World is a big meanie, but I was one of the unstupids who managed to follow your link, so I chimed in at Protein Wisdom, if you're interested in taking a look: [http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13422#comment-561129.](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13422#comment-561129.) Summary: If you excised the "only" from your original comment, I'd have considered it wholly uncontroversial. As it is, I'm surprised Jeff takes such umbrage.

No, no, _Riverside_ is the armpit of the UC system. (And my alma mater UCSC is its [Muladhara chakra](). Probably with a big sunburst tattoo on it.)

_As it is, I'm surprised Jeff takes such umbrage._

Umbrage is the stock in trade of certain bloggers; the more political, particularly, and the site in question seems to vacillate between umbrage and high dudgeon, when they're not trading in blithering eighthwit sniping.

O Literary Geniuses:  What's the allusion in the phrase, "In which I..."?  I keep feeling like I'm missing out on something.
