I nearly created another category, something along the lines of "Advice for/from the Febrile," but I hope these posts will constitute a passing phase in my life ... and not regular a category of experience that TypePad can capture in a neat column on the panel to the right.  So...

I came close to witnessing actual excrement on screen last night.  Let me save you the trouble: Under no circumstances should you ever watch [_AVP: Alien vs. Predator_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005JMZK/qid=1114103047/sr=8-1/ref=pd\_csp\_1/103-8289502-8607027?v=glance&s=dvd&n=507846).  From its laughable premise, via [von Daniken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von\_Daniken), to the story of how an African-American arctic explorer falls for the [Rasta Killing Machine from Outer Space](http://www.revearth.net/Graphics/SpringChiller/Predator.png) who, in turn, respects the African-American arctic explorer because, well, nevermind.  I don't want to ruin the suspense _AVP_ does its damnedest not to build.  If you're wondering why I mention the fact that the arctic explorer is an African-American, the answer's because I found it incredibly amusing that the film industry's faux multicultural\* ethos of having every race represented crept into this movie _given that the Predator is a Rasta Killing Machine from Outer Space._ 

Instead of wasting your time watching _AVP_, waste it reading comic books.  I highly recommend the Yiddish absurdism of Ben Katchor.  Examples?  You want examples?  Witness [The Call of the Wall](http://www.katchor.com/callofwallbig.html); the unnerving panels of [The Deep Tub](http://www.katchor.com/deeptubbig.html); the sociological sublime of [The Decorative Impulse](http://www.katchor.com/decimpulsebig.html).  You can also read Katchor's weekly strips on [his website](http://www.katchor.com/weeklystrips.html).  Words cannot recommend Katchor highly enough, so I hope he doesn't mind me pointing people to his words _and_ pictures.  

\*[The Hatemonger's Quarterly](http://hatemongersquarterly.blogspot.com) included "Faux Multiculturalism" in its annual Week of Loathing this year.  THQ's crack young staff describes the phenomenon:
Anyway, dear reader, in the midst of his brain-deadening otiosity, he
caught a peculiar commercial. It was an advertisement for some brand of
pickup truck, and it featured a group of young fellows in said truck,
one of whom was cheerfully singing along to ersatz country diva Shanaia
Twain’s “Man! I Feel Like a Woman” number. The other
lads in the pickup were looking mighty uncomfortable.

But that
wasn’t what interested “Chip.” On the contrary, like
any good multiculturalist (or any good racist, we might add), he was
taken aback by the ethnic mix in said pickup truck. A couple of whites,
a couple of blacks, one Chinese—this automobile was a moving
Benneton poster.Now don’t get us wrong, dear reader: We’re not some
passel of racists. In fact, we have always wondered why those so chirpy
about the “superiority” of the white race are the worst
examples of it. In addition, approximately 47 percent of the crack
young staff of “The Hatemonger’s Quarterly” are
Swedes and kindred swarthy minorities.

I didn't call it "unnerving" for nothing.  That'll teach you to not listen to me.  Since comic books, television and awful movies are the only entertainments I can handle for the headache, I've almost finished McSweeney's Quarterly Concern #13.  It's all about contemporary comics, and Katchor's feature in there as well.  As I said, I recommend the man's productions...
