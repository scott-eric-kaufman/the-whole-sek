Jonah Goldberg’s [modest opinion](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGY3ODg1ZGEyYjQ0OTYxYzc0Yzc0ZDNhN2Q1MzhjMDE=) of his own work:

It is a very serious, thoughtful, argument that has never been made in such detail or with such care.

Jonah Goldberg’s serious, thoughtful argument about John McCain’s
time in a North Vietnamese prison, presented in detail and with care:

The reason he doesn’t send email is that he can’t use a keyboard because of the relentless beatings he received from _the Viet Cong_ in service to our country.

Not that I [expect any better](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/i-recognize-i-c.html),
but if you’ve written about a war between North and South Vietnam,
shouldn’t you know the difference between North and South Vietnam?

Yeah, stupid error.  But the fact remains that the Obama "computer" ad simply lets McCain re-emphasize his sacrifices to the nation, while making Obama seem like the kind of guy who giggles at the Special Olympics.  

Of course, it's a sign of McCain's computer illiteracy that he equates typing with computing.  I know plenty of professors with carpal tunnel who rarely type but who have amazing knowledge of digital technologies.  Sadly, though, there's that lovely, homely story about the McCains' evening activities, where Cindy types while John dictates his emails.  

I suppose it's no longer even about \*what\* chinks Obama attacks in McCain's armor.  The Republicans are simply better at spinning all attacks into defenses of their victimhood and religious homilies.  

We attack Dubya's coke-and-booze-fueled escapades, and he gains support by turning it into a redemption story and conversion narrative.  If only Obama could spin his association with Ayers into a story of Christian forgiveness, a prodigal son story in which a man lost his way but found redemption in service to children and education, funded by conservatives and liberals alike.  

It's old hat, but that business about "framing" seems spot on here.

But lots of people make that mistake. And the LAT has editors and fact checkers, so they didn't catch it either. And Luther, profs who don't type probably don't send much email themselves, no matter how much they know about digital tech. That's not the point.   

Ayers is a slime bag who's destroyed everyone he's ever come in contact with. Obama should have ditched that association years ago.
