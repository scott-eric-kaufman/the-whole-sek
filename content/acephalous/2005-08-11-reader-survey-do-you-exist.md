## Reader Survey: Do You Exist?

Settle a bet: I think that the 160 or so unique hits I get each day represents about a grand total of 80 regular and 80 random readers.  Someone else thinks that it represents about 20 regular and 140 random readers.  

Could everyone who reads my ramblings twice per week or more drop a line saying as much in the comments?  You need not use your real name: this bet will be won or lost based on IP addresses.

Before accusations of ego-stroking arise, this bet stems from a conversation on possible outlets for the dissemination of serious academic work.  (As you can probably guess, I think blogs have the potential to be viable outlets given the cultivation of a suitably serious community.) 

Much appreciated in advance.

You're in my RSS feed, so that must make me a regular reader.

At least twice a week. Some times not enough time to stay for long. But twice a week at least.

I don't waste my valuable time reading blogs. Your blog is a blog, so I must be elsewhere, writing my dissertation. There I am over there right now. Hey you! What's a handsome guy like you doing without a boyfriend?

You know, a wise professor once said that you should judge the popularity of your site on the number of nice emails (unsolicitied, presumably) you get about it.

Nevertheless, I'll bet more bloggers wish they had the courage to ask this question.

Read or visit?  :p  

I do hit your site on average about twice a day.

Debbie, 

To be honest, I often get more unsolicited email than I care to, often of the unproductive can-you-help-me-with-my-term-paper variety.  I've resisted compiling a "greatest hits" of these emails because it'd break established protocols, but I could write a whiz-BANG! entry on all of the request from high schoolers and undergraduates for help with a paper on, say, Truman Capote or Tom Wolfe (about whom I wrote extensively when I was team-teaching the "Ethics of Literary Journalism" course last winter).  

To all,

Thanks to all who have spoken up so far.  So far I count 11, and that's far fewer than I had expected, but then again, what with the hornet's nest I stirred up on [the Valve](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/about\_us\_conservatives\_and\_our\_politics\_a\_case\_of\_mistaken\_identity/) this evening, I suppose I've alienated some of my audience.  Note to self: do not place bets while alienating significant portions of your audience unless you _want_ to lose them.  (The bets...and, I suppose, the audience.)

Yes, i read regular (according to Sage, 12 of the last 20 posts, but the cross-posted ones I usually don't read here). Don't be so impatient, Scott, some of us have Malle retrospectives to go to in the evening.

I read pretty regularly - close to every day. And from my perspective 12 unique visitors is huge; I'm lucky to get that many even counting repeats.

At least every other day or so. Just have to come and find out who you've been insulting lately.

Take a look at Bloglines, which will tell you how many people (like me) subscribe to your RSS feed(s) there.
