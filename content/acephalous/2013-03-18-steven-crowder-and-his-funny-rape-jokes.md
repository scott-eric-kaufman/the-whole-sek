CPAC supporters are [very](http://spectator.org/archives/2013/03/18/the-liberal-media-lie-about-cp) [upset](http://theothermccain.com/2013/03/17/the-huffington-post-lies-about-steven-crowders-cpac-monologue/) that _The Huffington Post_ “[lied](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/16/steven-crowder-ashley-judd\_n\_2892984.html)” about  “comedian” Steven Crowder’s criticisms of Ashley Judd. Here’s the “funny” rape “joke” that caused the fuss:

As you know, Ashley Judd has recently been heard equating
 both mining  and purchasing Apple Products to “rape.” So my commentary 
at CPAC on her  stupid, and insensitive comparisons was exactly this 
“This just in, Ashley Judd just tweeted that purchasing apple products 
is akin to rape … from her iPhone.”

Crowder was, according to himself, “Clearly taking aim at Ashley Judd
 for her stupid rape comments.” Which is all well and good, had the 
comments Judd made remotely resembled the ones Crowder attributed to 
her. Before getting to Crowder, let’s look at our favorite Confederate’s
 defense of him:

By tagging Crowder as a “Fox News contributor,” the 
writer of the HuffPo item signaled to liberal readers that the young 
comic is a hate-object.

It’s wrong to call Crowder a “Fox News contributor,” according to 
McCain, because it “signal[s]” something to liberal readers. You know 
who that criticism should be aimed at? The person who runs “[stevencrowder.net](http://stevencrowder.net/)” and identifies him “FoxNew’s brightest, funniest young Conservative mind.” Doesn’t that person know what he’s signalling?

His affiliation with Fox notwithstanding, Crowder’s comment is 
clueless for the simple reason that Judd never claimed that purchasing 
an Apple product was “akin,” metaphorically, to rape. She said, [according to that bastion of liberal propaganda, _The Daily Caller_](http://dailycaller.com/2013/03/11/in-2010-ashley-judd-accused-apple-customers-of-financing-mass-rape/#ixzz2NrVukZgf):

I am financing mass rape as I enjoy these ridiculously 
Global North  ultra-efficiencies and conveniences, for large scale rape 
is the  preferred predation mining interests use to humiliate and 
terrify local  populations, in order to control resource areas.

The relationship she describes there isn’t one in which purchasing an
 Apple product is “akin” to committing rape, but one in which purchasing
 material something built with “conflict minerals” makes one complicit 
in the brutal tactics of the regimes who mine them. The difference 
between Crowder’s summary and Judd’s actual statement couldn’t be more 
stark: he thinks she equates all evils with “rape,” you know, like 
liberals do; whereas she’s specifically identifying how rape is used in a
 particular cultural context to “convince” people to work for 
slave-wages.

I’m not saying that Judd hasn’t made outlandish statements in the past, but this strikes me as Crowder doing what [John Nolte and Jeff Goldstein](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/03/john-noltes-outraged-on-behalf-of-topless-women-everywhere.html)
 and every other anti-political correctness crusader loves to do: 
telling jokes that white men are forbidden to tell by the dark and 
womanly multicultural establishment. Because it’s just as bleeding edge 
now [as it was in ’77](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7S5BP-tvR8).
