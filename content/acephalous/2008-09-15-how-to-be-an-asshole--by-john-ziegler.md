## "How to Be an Asshole," by John Ziegler*

([_x-posted_](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/09/15/how-to-be-an-asshole-by-john-ziegler/).)  ([_and again_](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/how\_to\_be\_an\_asshole\_by\_john\_ziegler/).)

1. Use someone’s suicide to repeat cheap talking points:

I was neither as surprised, nor as upset by this tragedy as the many in the elite realm of reputable literature seemed to be.

2. Use someone’s suicide to assert your own importance:

I have a truly unique perspective on David Foster Wallace’s suicide.

3. Criticize someone for being polite and modest:

I found him to be more than a bit eccentric, but certainly nice enough not to be bothered too much by his presence.

4. Claim someone spent:

[A]t least two months following my every move before and during the broadcast of my show.

5. Then claim this person:

[H]ad intended to write a hit piece on talk radio and use me as the easy and naïve target.

6. Flaunt your ignorance:

I am embarrassed to say that I did not even know who
David Foster Wallace was and I was too stupid or lazy to bother to
simply “Google” him. It was only when the article was finally published
that I realized what a “big deal” he was supposed to be.

7. Remind people of it:

[A]nyone who attempts to read the 23-page cover story is
immediately struck by the use of many boxes off to the side of each
page where Wallace shares his parenthetical thoughts/statements to his
undisciplined telling of the story.

8. Once you’ve admitted surprise at the foonotes—thereby demonstrating you did no more research _after_ you allowed him access than you did _before_—speak hard truths about his talent:

But I also believe that there is an equally fine line
between real genius and just plain weirdness. In my experience, Wallace
had very little of the former, so he exaggerated the latter.

9. Glory in the evaluative freedom your ignorance affords you:

It is therefore far better to be weird and thought, at
worst, to be “too smart for the room,” than to play it straight and be
revealed as a “one hit wonder” or even a total fraud.

10. Despite “absolutely no evidence to backup [sic] this assertion,” claim this fraud committed suicide for personal gain:

While I have absolutely no evidence to backup this
assertion, I also think it is quite possible that he knew that killing
himself in his “prime” and before he had been totally exposed as being
a mere mortal in the literary realm would cement his status as a
“genius” forever.

11. Be a talentless AM radio hack whose name no one will remember tomorrow and write this:

David Foster Wallace was an overrated writer in life.
His suicide should not be used to elevate him even further beyond what
he deserved, in death.

12. Acknowledge this:

I know that it is considered bad form, or worse, to speak ill of the newly dead[.]

13. [Then do it anyway](http://johnziegler.com/editorials\_details.asp?editorial=165).

I just finished reading it all: the David Foster Wallace piece, which was excellent and John Ziegler's no-frills response. Suicide and analysis certainly don't mix. It's true that there's a definite cowardice to suicide, especially when family and children are involved. But it's presumptuous to guess that a man took his own life (!) to alter the impact of his artistic legacy. 

That said, John Ziegler felt the Wallace piece was skewed or otherwise lacking in accuracy; and it is his blog for such rants. The radio piece by David Foster Wallace was excellent and unlike any other I've read... rich with detail and studiocentric. 

Who's not had a suicide in the family? My condolences go out to Mr. Wallace's wife, child and loved ones. In this case, his work will live on.

This is some state-of-the-art narcissism. I'm going to show how out of touch I am with the mainstream, but is it well established that John Zeigler is a real person? Any chance he's just the creation of some comedian with too much time on her hands (or his)? Is that too much to hope for?

Congrats on the recent milestone, by the way--your post on Thursday brought back some memories. And luckily for you, Disneyland is just down the road...

Somedays, it feels like america is pretty much stocked to the brim with downmarket sportscasters turned talkradio button pushers (but the button's always broken). Like 85%!o(MISSING)f the population has a CV just like his, or would if they were, god, braver. That's just what it feels like, sorry... That was so depressing what you linked to.

Your "french" reminds me of the only time I have heard Bill Cosby utter a cuss word.  In a routine about drugs and drug use he asks a friend of his why he likes to do cocaine.  The friend responds: "Well, it intensifies your personality."  Cosby thinks about this for a second, and then asks, "What if you're an asshole?"

Seems apropos.

Nice take down, by the way.

If, as Ziegler says, there are inaccuracies in the DFW piece (and I _do_ wish you'd linked to it directly, instead of requiring us to click through the dreck to get to the good stuff), the absurdist vitriol of the posthumous attack pretty much confirms everything DFW wrote about his character.

Sorry, Ahistoricality: there's a direct link at the end of the post.  I guess the other links at the top might seem confusing.  I just didn't want to immediately point people to something so awful.  Keep down the number of referrals, you know.

Couple things:  

1. You go, boy. (Or girl). Thank you for raising your hackles at this jackass.

2. Let's not be fooled. A good talk show host presses our buttons. This guy has an axe to grind. Hell, he might even be right in some of what he says. Maybe DFW did alter the truth in his "Host" piece. Maybe in his sad, brilliant head he did think about his Legacy and how dying on Friday couldn't hurt his standing. In fact, I'd be surprised if he didn't. I'd also be surprised if he didn't feel like a fraud at times, if he didn't beat himself up for feeling too much pride at being called a genius.   

On the other hand, a GREAT talk show host (which is about as important as a great bookshelf) can elevate discourse the way DFW elevated literature in the 90s. The way he helped students learn. The way he touched so many of us.

I kind of like this douchebag's piece. When everyone feels one way about someone, I start getting antsy. It cannot possibly all be true. I'm glad to know he got under someone's skin so much that he decided to try to increase hits on his webpage and promote his own career by using a brilliant man's suicide as a mouthpiece for himself. It reminds me why I should continue to trust the words of David Foster Wallace.

I saw _that_ link: I meant a link to DFW's original article, so I _didn't_ have to click through he-who-I-won't-bother-naming's website.

Too bad theres no place for comments on Ziegler's page, but I'm sure he'll sniff his way here next time he self-googles. 

I read the Ziegler piece in the Lobster anthology and had the rare feeling that Wallace was sort of bored with this one altogether but he was being a sport by fulfilling his commitment.

Ziegler's reaction is the same as anyone when they are dismissed by the cool kids. No doubt he sees readers of DFW books as some sort of elite liberal clique who scorn his kind out of hand for their earthiness. My sense is we're more like normal people who can smell a con.

Nyahahhahhaha, bravo, bravo.  John Ziegler reveals himself that he is nothing but A MORON --- A VERY NARCISSISTIC MORON. And perhaps a psychopath too. He can't even construct a persuasive argument against the dead man -- you know reasonably, logically. WAY TOO OBVIOUS --- THE VERY THINGS THAT HE ACCUSES David Foster Wallace ARE THE VERY THINGS HE IS GUILTY OF. 

WHAT A COWARD TOO! No place for comments after his piece! 

To you Ziegler -- JUST LOOK AT THAT PICTURE OF YOURS IN YOUR WEBSITE. Frigging plastic smile -- the SMILE OF A HIDEOUS SALESMAN WHO ONLY SMILES BECAUSE HE WANTS SOMETHING FROM YOU. 

I BET YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR -- ALL THE FREAKING TIME. Go see a shrink. And I bet right this very minute your are googling ---- your name. You are a malignant narcissist.
