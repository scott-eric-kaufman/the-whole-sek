## Reason #981 in Favor of a Class Weblog

While tooling around the Internets this morning, I decided to pay attention to the columns sandwiching most of the content I consume.   On [Holbo's site](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/), I noticed he had linked to his class blog and--because I've often thought of starting one myself--I popped on over and found a post with [104 responses](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/ph1101egem1004/2005/03/how\_to\_look\_at\_.html#comments), more than half of them substantial.  Now, I know what you're thinking: "But A. Cephalous, you don't even know how many students are in John's class!  What if he has 71,981 and _only_ 104 could be bothered to post?"  I'm fairly certain John doesn't teach in [The Metrodome](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/gsapp/BT/DOMES/METRODM/2709-08.jpg), but even if he did, 104 students engaged enough to post something substantial is impressive. 

"But A. Cephalous, John teaches a philosophy class, and you know how philosophers-in-training are with their blather blather blather."  True, but I'm sure my students could blather with the best of them, esp. if properly motivated (i.e. threatened with bodily or gradily harm).  I think commenting on a blog is even less informal than posting on a listserv, so next quarter may be the quarter I compel my students to stop their livejournal- and myspace-inspired navel-gazing and enter the era of The PedaBlog!  (I know, I know.  I'm working on a better, less-likely-to-get-me-incarcerated but still damn catchy appellation.)

Didablog? 

On second thought, that actually sounds worse.

I threaten them with gradily harm. Works wonders. I had about 470 students last semester. Big intro module. Thanks for dropping by.

Well, duh. Those people aren't Americans. Look at the names.
