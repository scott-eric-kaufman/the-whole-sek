I believe if you start reading [here](https://twitter.com/scottekaufman/status/529841637632253952) you’ll be able to see exactly what I’ve been dealing with tonight…but that’s not why I’m writing this.

I’m writing this because some people — who can not be proven to be the people involved in that conversation — are threatening to tell my employers that [I’ve been accused of sexual harassment](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my\_morning.html) and am therefore an enemy to “true feminists” and “feminism” everywhere. They’re also claiming that [I failed to act appropriately](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/10/nonono.html) in another awful incident and this, I admit, is why I’m angry enough to write this post.

All of which tells me everything I need to know about them who would doxx me — I say let ‘em, as I know y’all remember things I’ve done that are far worse or more impolitic. Right?

Anonymous threatening people are anathema to feminism says this feminist and any other feminist (i.r. rational human being) with a lick of sense. You go, SEK!
