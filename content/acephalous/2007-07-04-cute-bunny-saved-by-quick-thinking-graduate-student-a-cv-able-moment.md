## Cute Bunny Saved by Quick-Thinking Graduate Student: A <em>CV</em>-able Moment

On the way home from the liquor store—_Albertsons'_ is inexplicably closed, so it's [Ed McMahon's Perfection](http://www.mcmahonvodka.com/about2.html) and a [Giant Slim Jim](http://www.conagrafoods.com/brands/slim\_jim/index.jsp)__for dinner tonight—I heard the unmistakable sounds of a scrum in the bushes to my left.  Peering over the flowering hedge, I saw a snake cornering a bunny in the gutter.  I brandished Ed McMahon to no effect.  I chunked a Giant Slim Jim.  Snake and bunny remained locked in a diaromic display of [Nature's red teeth and claws](http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:n8sN3nrUL7kJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In\_Memoriam\_A.H.H.+nature+red+in+tooth+and+claw).  I had no choice.  No bunny dies on my watch.  I grabbed a stick and entered the fray.  

The snake slithered away.  The bunny scuttled, stopped, turned to me almost appreciatively, then scooted away.  As I stood gasping against Blockbuster's faux-stucco exterior, I had a [_Rashomon_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon\_%!f(MISSING)ilm%!)(MISSING)-moment: 

My sympathies had been with the bunny from the first.  I never even considered the possibility that the bunny had been the aggressor.  An inveterate [squamataphobe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamata), I couldn't be bothered to give the snake the slightest benefit of the doubt.  He could've been slithering along, minding his own snake-business when Peter "The Scale-Snapper" Cottontail came bounding out the bushes, murder on his mind.  Maybe I missed the gang of feral rabbits hunkered in the brush, eagerly awaiting the signal to strike.  Then I remembered: 

_I_ _**intervened**.  Presided over a motherfucking **intervention**.  Right or wrong, it matters not: I did my academic duty.

Did you consider, as you prepared to chow down on your dehydrated beef stick, that you were depriving a hungry snake of its hard-earned bunny dinner?  You bleeding heart liberals are all the same.  Hypocrites, the lot of you!

So what did you end up having for dinner?

As the proud father of two bouncing bunnies, I can assure you that the rabbit was not the aggressor.  Fans of \*Donnie Darko\* and Svankmeyer's \*Alice\* be damned, bunnies always have good intentions.  If anything, the rabbit may have been trying to incorporate the snake into its warren.  Rabbits are very federal and communistic in that way.  When our three cats frolic with our two bunnies, the bunnies are in charge.  They corrale the kitties like sheep dogs sheep.

_They corrale the kitties like sheep dogs sheep_

I can't help but read this sentence and be reminded of this one:

Buffalo buffalo buffalo.

I should also say that I'm reminded of a key scene in Chretien de Troyes' _Yvain_ in which our knight, coming across a dragon and a lion fighting in a forest clearing, hesitates, filled with fear and wonder, while he tries to determine on whose side he should intervene. He chooses the lion, and the lion, in gratitude, performs the gestures of fealty and becomes Yvain's companion (hence the other title of the romance, _Chevalier au Lyon_.

Would that your bunny had folded its precious little paws together too! Then you could brave the world together!

I dislike bunnies ever since a roommate had one as a pet -- disgusting non-housetraineable creatures.  I would've helped the snake.  For that matter, if I saw a lion and dragon fighting, and felt the need to intervene, I would've helped the dragon.  I mean, lions are relatively ordinary.

Karl - we medievalists must be genetically linked in some way - that scene from Yvain was the first thing I thought of as well!  Scott, I'm glad you intervened on the side of fluff (and that's just my personal predilection) - and if that bunny behaves true to form, I think you've won an ally.  The next time you find yourself cornered in a dark alley by anything - be it wildebeest or lemming - I think you can expect your little cottontail to make an appearance and open up a can of whoop-ass...

Sorry the other comment reposted itself several times.  But, the bunny could have been the one deprived of a nice snake stew for dinner:

You have always had a soft spot for furry creatures.  As a child,the story goes, you wanted to play outside with the cute bears on our front lawn - in Canada - you did not understand that where little furry creatures could be found, big furry creatures might not be far behind or in this case a snake that wanted a bunny for dinner.
