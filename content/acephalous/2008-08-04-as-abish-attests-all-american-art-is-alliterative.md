## As Abish attests, all American art is alliterative.

Not really, of course.  Only if [it’s postmodern](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0811205339/diesekoschmar-20) or [romantic](http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=MeZPVaSa8lIC&dq=%!t(MISSING)he+real+america+in+romance%!&(MISSING)printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=rTzLqkxqTc&sig=4\_06CbG2cSLoOFuQcsX5AhSXDh8&sa=X&oi=book\_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPR8,M1), and today it’s romantic.  Edwin Markham’s _The Real America in Romance_ (1909) sought to blend “authentic history and romance … to their mutual advantage.”  His rationale:

Here are set before us the examples of great men of
earth, men great in their patriotism and self-sacrifice; and side by
side with them are romantic characters typical of the times, men and
women only less great in their kindliness and unselfishness, all
affording a high expression of the art of Anglo-Saxon romance. Instead
of reading about historical characters and events, we see the persons
themselves in action, and live with them through the events of their
day and generation. The reader loses himself in the irresistible
fascination of the story, and the impressions resulting are made on the
heart as well as on the intellect.

You do not merely read about Columbus: you endure with him his
hardships, share with him his disappointments, rejoice with him in his
achievements. You actually feel the thrill of discovery when the New
World swims into his vision. Not content with telling you merely that
Washington wintered and suffered at Valley Forge with his army, the
author takes you straightway into the camp, shows you the torn and
bleeding feet of the soldiers, and makes you stand watch with the
half-fed sentries, with little to warm your blood except a fiery
determination to die of cold, hunger, or British bullets, rather than
give up the fight for your country.

That’s a single paragraph in the original, but I’ve sliced it up 1) [because it’s overlong](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/on\_paragraph\_le.html),
and 2) to emphasize a rhetorical shift from “the reader” to “you.” 
What opens as a theory of literary affect quickly pivots into
admonishment — the reader who doesn’t endure, share, rejoice, winter,
suffer or stand watch isn’t merely a bad reader but unpatriotic.  “If
you have fail to empathize with those who fought ‘for _your_ country,’”
Markham as much as says, “you’re a terrible American.”  He never
considers a reader might withhold sympathy not because he or she
possesses a paucity of patriotism, but because his bathetic prose
betrays an ear unworthy of enthused encomium.  Consider the [first sentence of Volume IX, _The Stars & Stripes_](http://books.google.com/books?id=WWA-yFBCy7EC&pg=PA7&lpg=PP1&ots=VybmAwrKCX&dq=markham+stars+and+stripes&sig=ACfU3U1J7c7Y8APm5EzwMswiI45zVCUENg#PPA19,M1):

A band of boys was abroad in the streets of Boston.

But Scott, you say, happy accidents have happened heretofore! 
Granted.  Now consider the first two sentences of the second paragraph:

But it was not mirth nor mischief that brought them
forth to throng the streets.  So much might have been inferred from
their eager and excited talk as they hurried over the flagging, covered
thinly with snow.

Those alliterative pairs — “mirth nor mischief” and “eager and
excited” — bespeak a deliberately alliterative aesthetic agenda.  _Still_ don’t believe me?  Turn to the twenty-first page and proceed to ponder this passage:

Then the people, or such of them as did not feel the
restraint of the more orderly element, rose in riot.  The answer to the
riot came in the shape of red-coated soldiers, two regiments of them,
under Colonel Dalrymple; and the appointment of hated Hutchinson, Tory
townsman, as lieutenant-governor.  [...]  Now the tension of nearly two
years had been drawn taut within three days, and peace thus strained
had snapped.

The last phrase — “peace thus strained had snapped” — demonstrates
why authors aim alliterative for effect.  (My last sentence, not so
much.)  It is, in fact, a rather awesome example of alliterative
effect: the initial “s” links both words, but the long diphthong of
“strain” enacts a straining snapped by the short monothong of
“snapped.”  However, since Markham’s every sentence subsists on said
diet, this felicitous phrase fails to find favor.

The reader turned off by Markham’s abusive alliteration isn’t unpatriotic _per se_, merely in possession of refinement and taste.  But if the above hasn’t convinced you of Markham’s “talent,” try this:

With a whoop, the band broke toward the sentinel.

“Kill him!” they cried.  “Kill the bloody-backed scoundrel!”

They fell to pelting him with snowballs.

“The lobster is going to fire!” cried the lads, pressing closer.

What happens when you pelt lobsters with snowballs?  Death or [_Fafblog_](http://fafblog.blogspot.com/).

Reading you and the Little Professor, I sometimes think Real Literary Scholarship entails bringing the acutest, best-informed attention to bear on crap.

I think the problem is that if you're studying anything more than a half-century old, Vance, all the best stuff has been taken, in that whenever you think that you're saying something new about it, all that you're really doing is accidentally repeating what some prior critic has written.

That's the attraction of brand-new theoretical approaches, of course.  All of a sudden you can re-visit the old standards.  But soon enough they've all been re-done.

As you may have read on Acephalous sometime back, I'm awaiting the natural extension of this phenomenon, Jo.  Jo is a grad student (or whatever their equivalent is) a few centuries from now, or whenever, when increasing population and education and who-knows-what expansion of mental capacity have led to not only the exhaustion of the good works of the past, but even of the crappier ones.  And of course, our era is one of the first really pickily archived ones.  At that point, Jo will be doing some sort of thesis on literary conversations at the turn of the 20th century, and will be picking over these comments: "So who is Vance Maverick?  Can I identify this source?"  Perhaps your comment above will head up one of Jo's chapters, or something.

I shall strive to compose my incoherent feces-flinging and self-contradiction in a form worthy of Jo's scrutiny.

I think that to a mentality that can find interest in centuries-old blog comment threads, being "worthy of scrutiny" is rather beside the point.  But this mentality must eventually exist, given enough time and variation and assuming no catastrophic breakdown in civilization.  After all, Scott is already reading Jack London's letters and whatnot.

Actually, I'll go out on a further predictive limb.  Assuming that someone archives these blog comments somehow, the first grad student to express interest in them will appear not centuries from now, but 30 years from now.

Prosodic note: Initial vowels don't produce an alliterative effect, and "eager and excited" doesn't even work as assonance. Not that I have anything against annoying affectations, but Markham's affectations are inept as well as annoying.
