Stumbled from D.C. to Philadelphia to Houston today.  Haven't had an internet connection since Thursday morning.  Physically incapable of responding to 280 emails tonight.  Will write about [the first blogger gathering](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the\_mla\_blogger\_gathering/), the second blogger gathering, [the panel](http://acephalous.typepad.com/abstract.html), and [UnfoggeDCon](http://outtamindouttasite.typepad.com/outtasite/2006/12/unfoggedcon\_06.html) from California, after many, many hours of uninterrupted sleep.

Cool!  

Too much "sleep" might be confused with estivation, so consider yourself warned.
