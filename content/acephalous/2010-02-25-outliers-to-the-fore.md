## Outliers to the fore!

Because I teach rhetoric, not statistics, I chose not to have my students run standard deviations and what-not on the results of their final surveys.  (Discipline-specific research classes further down the line will teach them the correct arcane maths to perform upon their data.)  Instead, I thought I'd teach them how to present their oversimplified results in a professional manner, _i.e._ how to couch the results of their small surveys in language that acknowledges the limitations of generalizing from scant data.  Since the majority of their citations came from the [Ed Diener-edited](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/02/i-now-expect-to-be-the-arthur-bellowgoode-distinguished-chair-in-funny-book-studies-someday.html) _Journal of Happiness Studies_, that seemed like the best place to filch examples from.  But what I found there dismayed me as both [an academic and a former baseball player](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/05/i-take-requests-remember-that-post-you-wrote-about-playing-in-the-outfield-and-writing-a-dissertatio.html).  

My baseball career was not illustrious: I was a defensive specialist whose slugging percentage mirrored a batting average that occasionally threatened to break [the Mendoza line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendoza\_Line).  Despite rarely making contact and having no power to speak of, during the summer of my junior year I slugged a Ruthian .640 and flirted with a .500 batting average ... for 52 non-consecutive at bats against pitchers whose deliveries I knew intimately from having played behind them for three seasons.\*  To extrapolate my true talent from that five-game series would be the height of folly _for the simple reason that the sample size would be hilariously small_.  Even for something as statistically quantifiable as hitting ability, a data set of fifty-two captures nothing of statistical significance.

Or does it?  Because today I learned that I could have been the greatest hitter in the history of the game: the aforementioned journal considered the results of a survey _of fifty-two people_ important enough to warrant publication.  If that's all that's required to establish statistical significance in academia, it should be more than enough to demonstrate the same in a silly children's game.  By those standards, proof of the illustrious career I would have had can be derived from the self-reported data above so long as I include a paragraph like this one in the "Discussion" section:
The study has limitations which must be taken into account when
findings are interpreted.  According to common statistical guidelines, the present sample size was small, resulting in
modest effect sizes, so the findings should be viewed as preliminary,
and requiring replication in a larger sample.  Interpreting this evidence is by no means straightforward, but the way we interpreted our findings were consistent
 with the theoretical position we entertained.  In sum, preliminary investigation indicates that Scott Eric Kaufman likely would have been the best hitter in the history of professional baseball.

So my assignment for my students is to isolate ten examples of the rhetoric of dubious-but-professionally-acceptable hedging in the _Journal of Happiness Studies_ and employ them in their discussion of the results of their surveys.  If their pool of 52 students happens to contain two homosexual women of African-American descent who are also on the dean's list, they can generalize about the academic achievement of _all_ African-American lesbians so long as they couch their conclusions in the speculative rhetoric found in the journal.  This may seem irresponsible of me, but remember that my purpose here is to teach them how to write well and read critically, and if they're parroting the prose of established scholars and learning to mistrust certain rhetorical tics, I've done my job.

\*I went something like 26-52 with 10 doubles, all of which were pulled down the line.  They tipped the breaking pitches they couldn't throw for strikes, so I sat on the two-seamers that never really sank, started swinging outrageously early and yanked them down the line.  

Update: 
Read the comments before you decide to SMASH. 
Apparently my undergraduate statistics teacher pushed the
anecdote-is-not-data argument a tad too enthusiastically, so my
annoyance with a sample size of 52 is unjustified.  Fortunately, as
they say: Blogs is for learning.

As a nominally trained statistician, I have to weigh in here.  I agree that the example you cite is a very small sample for a simple survey of adults.  However, I relish the opportunity to give a lesson in context to the rhetoric teacher.

Sometimes 52 is as many samples as you can get.  Imagine you're studying coyotes for your MS and you have 3 months in each of two years to do your field work.  How many coyotes do you think you could find and CATCH in that time?

Another example is human physiology/biomechanics research.  It is time consuming and expensive to get subjects to come in, particularly if you are researching elite athletes.  Can you imagine any of those Olympic athletes donating 4 months of their time to your research and let you monkey with their training?

So yeah, 52 seems small for that particular example, but an "acceptable" sample size, for publication or any other purpose is highly dependent on context.

That's completely fair, but when the context is a survey of random adults, it seems odd that an academic publication would have lower standards than the latest CNN/Gallup poll.  It's not as if there are only so many random adults out there in the world.  This was implicit in the post, and I should have said it outright: my consternation isn't with the size of the sample _per se_, but with the size relative to the amount of available data; and, in the case of any baseball career, 52 at bats is criminally "modest."

Tautology alert!

Also, and I'm surprised the statistician didn't mention this, but 52 can be a statistically significant sample if your population is small enough: if you're surveying, for example, Jewish Asianists in tenure-track academic positions, 52 would be a pretty good sample of the whole (which couldn't be more than a few thousand).

Also, the deviation matters.  52 is more than enough to figure out how often a coin flips heads or tails....

Plus, I don't know how close the paraphrase is, but articles worded as you example would be taken with a boulder of salt.

We, sir, are in complete agreement.  Sorry if I ranted.  We all have our passions.

_Also, and I'm surprised the statistician didn't mention this, but 52 can be a statistically significant sample if your population is small enough_

I meant for my comment to at least imply something along those lines.  Oh well.  Interestingly, if your population is small enough (or your sample large enough, and your population is finite) you can get a sample that's too big.  At least, if your sample is too large a fraction of your population you start to break the assumption of independence in the case of simple random sampling.  Ten percent is often thrown around as a rule of thumb.

The real question about a sample of 52 is whether it is plausibly a random sample. The problem with the baseball example is that you're explicitly not talking about a random sample. If you were to take 52 at bats selected at random from your entire baseball career it would be a pretty good measure of your hitting ability.

Of course, in this case, it's unlikely that he got a random sample.

I think you're being just a tad hard on yourself in your update.  If one is looking to survey, say, US adults, then it's perfectly fair to say that 52 is a rather small sample.  It's just that it might not be totally useless.  The single hardest thing to teach in statistics is the inherent subjectivity in making judgements about these kinds of things.

But while we're all thinking about this stuff, consider this: isn't it miraculous that pre-election surveys with sample sizes as small as 500 are as accurate as they are in predicting the opinions of more than a hundred million people?
