For $500 and the game, name the author of the following quotations: 

**Representative of the Mode**

Any slightly more than casual reader of literary journals knows either repertoire, and probably yawns at them both—as much as he is also bored by any eclecticist who tries to use all the factional vocabularies to make a transcendental synthesis.  But, in the manner of an impressionistic historian, one can say there _are_ things about what goes on in contemporary criticism today that are typical, even representative of the mode...

**From "Fugitive Essays" to _Aletheia_ in Three Simple Steps**

If these anthologies serve any real function—aside from being convenient ways for the reader to get hold of fugitive essays—it is to let one think that they make up a consensus for today's critic, an immediate background he presumes to be accurate, from which he launches his own work, to which he responds, against which he defines himself, his allies, or his opponents.  In accepting such a background the critic also presumes a background for the background, and without being too dodgy, he would say that these anthologies and what they represent aim to be different from previous anthologies and consensuses, which in turn were different from previous ones...

**"Challenges" of the Lesser Critic**

Most great critics are methodical; this perhaps only means that they are able to articulate and rationalize their intuitive awareness of literature.  But it also means that they are not afraid of making their methods and their own writing independently interesting and intellectually consistent, over and above a work.  For the lesser critic such challenges are rare.  He will use the work in order to make it work, which it always will.  His method will demonstrate its effectiveness, which it will always possess.  And on and on, without any sense of the drama underlying method, or of its fundamental ground in intellectual life...

**The Will-to-Eccentricity**

Some of these dimensions appear perforce eccentric, even determinedly so.  But this will-to-eccentricity, I think, is a major project of contemporary critical discourse...

I don't know who wrote this, but his vile absence of erudition, his totalitarian instinct for mockery, and his phenomenally unsophisticated guesses about a field about whose length and breadth he can only dream, make me absolutely certain that only you, Scott Eric Kaufman, hypostasizing yourself with the fiction of an Other, could sink as low as to press these charges with no regard for the common decency of the discipline.

I would like to know if I am right. You owe me -- nay, you owe all of us -- that courtesy.

Did Frank Herbert ever write any criticism, something in the writing style and style of thought reminds me of him.

[X] for the block.  [Thanks to Google, of course.  I don't read essays written in 1976.  They are yellow and they smell funny.]

I [X]'d Luther's comment in case anyone else wanted to play.  Despite being from 1976, the essay it's from is quite good, scathing even (as those quotes suggest) on this.
