[Really](http://scifi.com/scifiwire2005/index.php?category=5&id=33225)?  I wonder if the same could be said of [_The Golden Bowl_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0140432353)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1)?  An excerpt from the article:
**
_Seeker_ Filled With Signs
**

SF author Jack McDevitt told SCI FI Wire that his new book, [_Seeker_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0441013295)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1), contains numerous symbols, which he leaves for the readers to interpret. For example, _Seeker_'s protagonist, antiquarian Alex Benedict, discovers a cup from the long-lost ship _Seeker_ and sets out to find the ship. The cup is a symbol, but McDevitt doesn't say of what.

"Symbolic writing is necessary to make fiction work," he said in an
interview. "The reason is that a novelist or short story writer is not
simply delivering a narrative, but (s)he is creating an experience for
the reader. When a character becomes jealous, the reader, ideally,
feels the emotion. That can't be accomplished simply by telling the
reader that Character A is jealous. And this is where the symbol comes
in."

To illustrate his point, McDevitt referred to Charles Dickens' [_A Christmas Carol_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)0553212443)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1).
"When the Spirit and Scrooge stand outside the Cratchits' house on
Christmas Eve, Scrooge asks whether [Tiny] Tim will live. Dickens could
have had the Spirit reply, 'No, it's not going to happen.' But that
doesn't carry sufficient impact. So he uses symbols to appeal to the
reader's senses: 'I see an empty chair, and a crutch by the fire.'"

There's always something amusing yet embarassing about these moments.  Try the Holbonic blog post [here](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2004/07/crisis\_on\_the\_i.html), for instance, and skip down right to the end, to the paragraph headed "Hey, I've got a great idea! What if a god just sort of came of ... a machine?".

It's funny, yes, but it makes you concerned for the genre.  Sure, not everthing written within the genre is at that level.  But that both the people publishing the article containing the proud explanation of a naive rediscovery and the vast majority of its readers didn't notice and laugh indicates that there is no critical or even economic pressure separating the good from the bad within the genre.

     News Flash is taken a bit out of context. I was specificially asked if there were any symbols in SEEKER. Not sure how else I could have answered.

     Eventually I'll learn to proof. Make that 'specifically.'
