As previously noted, my chronic insomnia and the scheduling of television in the night’s more obscure recesses often [compel me to watch _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/07/what-will-become-of-the-children-why-theyll-be-raped-and-murdered-of-course).
 One side-effect of such viewings is that I sometimes drift in and out 
of consciousness during commercial breaks, and I assume that anything I 
remember watching is a daft melange of half-heard words and 
half-remembered dreams of the sort an almost-deaf person might concoct 
to explain the episode to himself after the fact. Like the time I 
watched that episode about Big Boi being eaten by hyenas after Detective
 Stabler was shot over a monkey in a basketball — that _had_ to the product of secondary elaboration.

[Only it wasn’t](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1248640/).

So, when I awoke this morning convinced that I’d seen two seasons of _Doctor Who_ spoiled by [a 2008 episode of _SVU_ about “sexting,”](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1248633/) I couldn’t just chalk it up to shoddy dreamwork. I fired up the Netflix machine, turned on the closed captions and _wouldn’t you know it_? A 2008 episode of _SVU does_ contain the mother of all spoilers for the fifth and sixth seasons of _Doctor Who_. See what I mean below the fold:

But I’m sure it’s just a coincidence.
