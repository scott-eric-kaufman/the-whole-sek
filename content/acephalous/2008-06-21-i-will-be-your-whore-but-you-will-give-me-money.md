## I will be your whore, but you will give me money

If you're the kind of person who likes to open 423 articles in JSTOR so as to bring the CPU of his relatively new computer to its knees, you should [download Firefox 3](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/).  

Right now, I have **78** tabs open.  More than half of them are JSTOR articles—for those without access, that means gigantic memory-hogging images—and Firefox is currently occupying 298,732 K of memory.  Yesterday, it would've easily engorged 1,400,000 K and had my CPU in tears.  

Short of extreme protestation, I'm not sure how to make this endorsement sound earnest at this point.  

But it is. 

_This has been a public service announcement from the good people at SEK Industries._

You did _not_ just use the word "engorged" in a post with that title.   

\*shakes head sorrowfully\*

"If you're interested in the kind of web browser that enables foolish and ill-considered research methods, yous should try FF3!  Not only will it allow you to open an overwhelming number of articles before you check to see whether any of them are actually relavent to your research questions, but it's also good for porn."

I did, didn't I?  See, this is what happens when you divide your attention between 423 articles.

_it allow you to open an overwhelming number of articles before you check to see whether any of them are actually relavent to your research questions_

Your bug is my feature.

_it's also good for porn_

I wouldn't know anything about that.  This is a family computer, centrally located where spouses can see everything.  (_I.e._ I keep the other computer under the mattress.)

I am exactly that kind of person, and I've now downloaded Firefox 3 at your urging. So far, the difference has been amazing. The speed with which I can move between different windows/tabs is what really blows my mind -- there's no delay in switching to one of the tabs with a pdf file open! I had to download an add-on (once I figured out what an "add-on" was) that allows me to use the Premium version of Outlook Web Access instead of the Lite version that Firefox 3 normally uses, but having figured that out, I don't think there's any reason NOT to use Firefox instead of Internet Explorer.

Thanks for the tip!

OK, so hopefully that came across as teasing rather than bitey, which is how I was intending it.  Also, the porn insinuation was inevitable, as the following post show, but I don't entirely feel good about being the one to make it here.

Also also, try not to roll over too heavily on your shameputer.

Who knows what blogs are really supposed to do? Is your witty, erudite, intelligent blog also a CNET port, getting me to a finally decent OS X web browser? WHY NOT?
