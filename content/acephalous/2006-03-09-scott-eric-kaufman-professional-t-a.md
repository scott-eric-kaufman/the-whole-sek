As a T.A. this quarter, my classroom responsibilities include all-purpose AV technician and intellectual peanut gallery.  So in the course of a conversation about Sebastian Junger's  [_The Perfect Storm_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)006101351X)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1)—in which, you remember, he speculates about the last hours of the _Andrea Gale_—when the Pulitzer Prize-winning professor notes that Junger did his best to approximate what probably happened to the crew of the _Andrea Gale_, it is my responsbility to inform the class "it could've been witches."  To wit:
**Scott:** It could've been witches.**Barry Siegel:** But it _probably_ wasn't.

**Scott:** But it _could have been._

**Barry Siegel:** How would we know if it was?

**Scott:** Look at her nose . . .

Then hilarity would ensue and Siegel wouldn't be able to look at me the entire rest of the class period without turning bright red at the thought of [this](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)B00000F6LQ)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1).  (I sometimes blame the disappearance of _Andrea Gale_ on wizards and ponies.  This year I pinned it on witches.  Note that I said "wizards _and_ ponies," not "wizards _on_ ponies."  Everyone knows wizards _on_ ponies are above reproach.)

I am also responsible for taking attendence and keeping a watchful eye on students during the class.  Today I saw a student a little too invested in typing every word Barry said.  So I sent her an email which read:

Subject:  
DON'T LAUGH!

Dear [Student]:

Your dignity depends on it.  I know you see me staring you down . . . waiting for the slightest hint of a smile to crease your cheeks.  Don't look up.  Because I'm picking my nose.  _For you_.  Don't try to hold it in either.  That'll only cause you to laugh even harder.  I'll see your face contort as you attempt to suppress the laughter which will not let you deny its existence.  It has a voice!  It wants to be heard!  DON'T LET IT!  YOU CANNOT LAUGH!  IF YOU LAUGH I WILL FORCE YOU TO WEAR THE BONNET OF SHAME!  WHILE ON A PONY!  WITH A WIZARD!  NAMED "GREG"! 

OR POSSIBLY "JASON!" 

SO WHATEVER YOU DO: DON'T LAUGH!

Until they paternalistically shut down the internet access in our classrooms, we law students shopped online, paid our bills, checked our email and chatted on IM during lecture.  Sometimes it was very useful, like if you were suddenly called on, and didn't know the answer, you could stall by saying "Um," and 5 of your class buddies would IM you the answer. Other times, it was obviously not class related, and you had to stifle your laughter. I have found that feigning a sneeze, followed by a coughing fit works.

I have to admit, I paid better attention after the cut the internet, but I still say that if we adults want to waste our $20,000/year education by checking our email (and hey, sometimes we used it for academic reasons)--well, we should be allowed to!  Besdies, after they cut the internet, the crazy notetakers (me) kept on taking notes like they always did, and the time-wasters switched from online Poker to Spider Solitaire.  Nothing ever changes.

But the fake coughing fit works.

I wondered what the laughing was all about.  I felt it directed towards someone sitting in the vicinity of me.  For a moment I thought people were laughing at me (it's a notion I indulge in that could either be interpreted as egomaniacal or indicative of a serious emotional disorder) due to one of the increasingly whiny comments I was making that seemed to engage the girl behind me ("I disagree!"), who I responded to telepathically ("Whatever"). 

There's a girl in my Crit. class who takes no notes, has ipod earphones discreetly in, and is obsessed with browsing some sort of Bob Dylan fanclub site.  There's a guy in LJ101A who will not cease from reading the contents of a Honda Sportscar networking page.  In French, a guy next to me is chatting on AOL messenger the entire class; his screen name is BiBlackJohn23 if anyone's interested.   

The image of a wizard on a pony (preferably wearing a conehat supplanting bonnet) is something I will cherish, thank you.

Belle, (_whips out stick and proceeds to thwap_) BAD BELLE!  BAD!  STOP IT!  WE INVEST A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY INTO AND IF YOU-WHO-ARE-NOT-COMPELLED-TO-LISTEN-TO-US DON'T THEN WE'RE GOING TO SLIT OUR COLLECTIVE WRISTS!

Zach, Sorry about making you think I was laughing at you.  The student in question sits behind you and to your right, and she's a regular contributor to the class.  In fact, she raised her arm so violently to defend Junger today I thought she would've snapped her elbow in two.  (And for future readers, this student in question is a bright, articulate student who simply got BUSTED! today.  Also, since she's one of "my" kids, she wouldn't mind this anonymous ribbing.  And Zach, I should note that one of the reasons you thought I was looking at you when I couldn't keep my composure is because I was, since if I looked behind you she'd start laughing again, then I'd start laughing again, then everyone would look at me and try to discern why I was laughing . . . but as for the _Holy Grail_ thing, I'm fairly certain no one else caught that, but it certainly cracked Barry up.

To everyone else, as if it even needs saying: not only was the class discussion one of best I've ever seen in a lecture that large, but it was also the single most entertaining teaching experience I've ever had.  I _barely_ kept it together today.  _Barely_.  

Were I a truck, the hilarity of today's class was of [a steepness, I judge, that would have caused the vehicle, had it slipped off the road, to go end over end enveloped in flame at a hundred yards a bounce](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/geological\_weir.html).  It was _that_ awesome.

It WAS a great discussion.  All the kids who jumped all over Junger in the reading responses finally came out to play--even after our esteemed Pulitzer Prize-winning professor made it clear what his opinion was.  And I thought you were laughing at me.  Ok, maybe not.  Anyway, she was playing solitaire not reading her email.  But, I didn't watch her the whole time, so maybe she was.  I'm sure she won't mind if we kid her a little.  She is a bright one.  I want to be like her when I grow up.  And Zach too.

The multi-purpose t.a.   

That email was an awesome move.  

I get so distracted when someone's on their computer next to me, then I inevitably eavesdrop- for instance I know that Zach gets way to much spam and that the U2 tour is cancelled, but Madonna's in top form.   

I don't bring my lap top.  Instead I distract myself the old fashioned way, doodling and passing notes.  My last note today:  Scott &hearts s McPhee.

p.s. Zach, I disagree!  I wouldn't say you were whiny, I'd say persistent.
