_SEK takes his car to TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN in order to make sure it won’t explode and kill him when he makes a road trip next week._

**TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN:** You just put a new battery in it?

**SEK:** That I did.

**TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN:** Means your electrical is reset, our computer can’t do a lot of the tests.

**SEK:** So long as its fluids are replenished and it doesn’t have murder in its heart, I’m fine.

**TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN:** So when do you need it by?

**SEK:** I have a meeting at 2 p.m.

**TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN:** I don’t think I can have it done by 1:30.

**SEK:** No a problem, I work online. Just need to be back home and I live around the corner.

**TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN:** What do you do?

**SEK:** I write online.

**TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN:** People do that?

**SEK:** As long as they pay me to.

**TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN:** I thought that was computers did that.

**SEK:** ?

**TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN:** They don’t have that shit programmed out yet? Our computer tells us what happened with a car, figure it was the same with what the President said and shit.

**SEK:** I don’t think they have a computer that can do that.

**TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN:** Couldn’t be worse than what they’ve got.
