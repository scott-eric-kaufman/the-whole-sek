## "Monkey Butt Trumpet"

That's the subject line of the email I just sent my advisor.  I _meant_ to send a quick note to the Little Womedievalist to the effect that she should spin her collection of inexplicable medieval marginalia into a blog of hilarious proportions ... but she shares the first letter of her Christian name with my advisor, and Outlook decided to send him the email I intended for her.  

I caught light of my mistake as I tabbed to and smacked "Send."  (What was it Saint Malkmus sang?  "[Type Slowly](http://acephalous.typepad.com/typeslowly.mp3)" [.mp3]?  Maybe I should heed this shit.)  By then it was too late.  

So thank you, [Mr. Cohen](http://jjcohen.blogspot.com/2007/12/what-is-that-monkey-doing-with-that.html), thank you for forcing me to send an email to my advisor explaining that I hadn't sent him the final draft of my first chapter, but a link to a picture of a medieval "monkey butt trumpet."  (I have no idea where the hyphen belongs there.  It could just as easily be a "monkey-butt trumpet" as a "monkey butt-trumpet.")  

I owe you one.

Your brain is telling you that you miss the little woman.  We have her and we will not give her up!!  We are having fun with an all female household!!!  Or - perhaps you should not drink so much when you are alone and working on your book.

I'm not drinking, Ma.  I type too fast for my own good.  Really though, the problem is that the Little Womedievalist has far too many photos of obscene medieval marginalia on her laptop.

SEK, I think you exist for me to be able to go "whoah! It could be so much worse!"

Thanks!

A lot of people think that the paintings of Hieronymous Bosch are symbolic and imaginary, but it's becoming increasingly clear that they're realistic. The critical canon will have to be rewritten.

I seldom can say this and mean it, but now I can: "The pleasure is all mine."

When looking at their feet, I conclude they are \*not\* monkeys.

The question remains: does the picture suck or blow?
