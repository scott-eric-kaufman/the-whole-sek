Last week a curator unearthed the following poem from a WWI era canteen in a Clark County, Ohio musuem.  The person who found it doesn't know whether it's a famous, infamous or unknown poem but sincerely solicits outside opinion.  If you know this poem or some familiar cognate, feel free to expound.  So now, I present to you "Untitled Poem Stuffed in a Canteen Circa 1917":
So you're taking the census, mister?  
  there's three of us living still.  
My wife an I and our only son,  
   that folks call "Whispering Bill."  
But Bill couldn't tell ye his name sir  
  and as it's hardly worth giving  
For you see a bullet killed his mind  
  and left his body living.

This is the full poem sent by DW Shockey. Ravenswood, WV.

Wisperin Bill

So yer takin' the census, eh Mister.  

Lemme tell ye about my son.  

He was a soldier thet fought fer the North  

Until the war wuz won.

This dooryard's now his battlefield.  

Lesee, he wuz nigh sixteen  

When Sumpter fell and as likely a boy  

As this world's ever seen  

And what with the news of battles lost  

And shoutin' and all the noise  

Ah giss every farm in the neighborhood  

Lost a part of it's crop of boys.

‘Twas harvest time when Bill left home   

Every stalk in the field of rye  

Seemed to stand tip toe to see him off  

And wave him a fond goodbye.  

His momma used to tell him  

When she knowed he wuz goin' away  

That God’d surely take care of him   

If'n he didn't fergit to pray.

And on the bloodiest battlefields  

When bullets whizzed through the air  

And Bill wuz a-fightin' desprit  

He used to whisper a prayer.  

His comrads has often tol' me  

That Bill never flinched a bit  

When every second a gap in the ranks  

Showed where a ball had hit.

Then one night when the field wuz covered  

With the awful harvest of war,  

They found my boy 'mongst the martyrs  

Of the cause he wuz fightin' for.  

His fingers wuz clutched in the dewy grass,  

Oh no Sir, he wasn't dead.  

He just lay there sort of helpless and crazy  

With a rifle ball in his head.  

And if Bill had only died that night  

I'd give all I got worth givin'  

'Cause ya see that bullet killed his mind  

But left his body livin’.  

An officer he wrote and told us  

How the boy'd been hurt in a fight  

But he said that the doctors reckoned  

They could bring him 'round alright.  

Well, we waited and watched fer a month or more.  

The summer wuz almost past  

When we got a letter one day that said  

Bill had started fer home at last.

I'll ne'er fergit when Bill come home,  

"Twas harvest time again.  

The air blowing o’er the yaller fields   

Was sweet with the smell of grain.  

The dooryard wuz full of neighbors  

That come to share our joy  

And we all set out a rousin' cheer  

At the sight of that solier boy.

Then all of a sudden some-one said,  

"My God, don't that boy know his mother?"  

And Bill stood a-whisperin' fearful like  

And starin' from one to another.  

"Don't be afraid Bill." said he to himself  

As he stood in his coat of blue.  

"God'll take care of you, Bill  

God'll take care of you."

Bill seemed to keep loadin' and firin' a gun  

And actin' like a man who hears  

The awful sounds of the battlefield  

A-poundin' in his ears.  

Ten thousand ghosts from that bloody day  

Was a-marchin' through his brain  

And his feet they kind of picked their way  

As if they could feel the slain.

He ain’t never knowed us since that day   

Nor his sweetheart and never will.  

Mother and father and sweetheart,  

We all the same to Bill.  

And he groans like a wounded soldier  

Sometimes the whole night through  

And we just smooth his head and say, "Yes Bill,  

God'll take care of you."

Irving Batchelder (written in the 1860's during civil war)

 Orginal Poem written by Irving Bacheller. Sent by DW. Shockey

WHISPERIN' BILL 

So ye 're runnin' fer Congress, mister ? Le'me tell   

ye 'bout my son—   

Might make you fellers carefuller down there in   

Washington—   

He clings to his rifle an' uniform—folks call him   

Whisperin' Bill;   

An' I tell ye the war ain't over yit up here on Bowman's   

Hill.   

This dooryard is his battle-field—le's see, he was nigh   

sixteen   

When Sumter fell, an' as likely a boy as ever this   

world has seen;   

An' what with the news o' battles lost, the speeches   

an' all the noise,   

I guess ev'ry farm in the neighborhood lost a part   

of its crop o' boys. [

T was harvest time when Bill left home; ev'ry stalk   

in the fields o' rye   

Seemed to stan' tiptoe to see him off an' wave him   

a fond good-bye;   

His sweetheart was here with some other gals—the   

sassy little miss!   

An' purtendin' she wanted to whisper'n his ear, she   

give him a rousin' kiss.   

Oh, he was a han'some feller! an' tender an' brave   

an' smart,   

An' though he was bigger'n I was, the boy had a   

woman's heart.   

I couldn't control my feelin's, but I tried with all   

my might,   

An' his mother an' me stood a-cryin' till Bill was   

out o' sight.   

His mother she often tol ' him, when she knew he   

was goin' away,   

That God would take care o' him, maybe, if he   

didn't fergit to pray; 

An' on the bloodiest battle-fields, when bullets   

whizzed in the air,   

An' Bill was a-fightin' desperit, he used to whisper   

a prayer.   

Oh, his comrades has often tol' me that Bill never   

flinched a bit   

When every second a gap in the ranks tol' where   

a ball had hit.   

An' one night, when the field was covered with the   

awful harvest o' war,   

They found my boy 'mongst the martyrs o' the cause   

he was fightin' for.   

His fingers was clutched in the dewy grass—oh,   

no, sir, he wasn't dead,   

But he lay kind o' helpless an' crazy with a rifle-   

ball in his head;   

An' he trembled with the battle-fear as he lay there   

in the dew;   

An' he whispered as he tried to rise: "God 'll take   

care o' you." [

An officer wrote an' to ' us how the boy had been   

hurt in the fight,   

But he said the doctors reckoned they could bring   

him around all right.   

An' then we heard from a neighbor, disabled at   

Malvern Hill,   

That he thought in the course of a week or so he'd   

be comin' home with Bill.   

We was that anxious t' see him we'd set up an'   

talk o' nights   

Till the break o' day had dimmed the stars an'   

put out the Northern Lights;   

We waited an' watched fer a month or more, an'   

the summer was nearly past,   

When a letter come one day that said they'd started   

fer home at last.   

I'll never fergit the day Bill come—'twas harvest   

time again—   

An' the air blown over the yeller fields was sweet   

with the scent o' the grain;

The dooryard was full o' the neighbors, who had   

come to share our joy,   

An' all of us sent up a mighty cheer at the sight o'   

that soldier boy.   

An' all of a sudden somebody said: "My God!   

don't the boy know his mother ?"   

An' Bill stood a-whisperin', fearful like, an' a-starin'   

from one to another; "  

Don't be afraid, Bill," says he to himself, as he   

stood in his coat o' blue, "  

Why, God 'll take care o' you, Bill, God 'll take   

care o' you."   

He seemed to be loadin' an' firm' a gun, an' to act   

like a man who hears   

The awful roar o' the battle-field a-soundin' in his   

ears;   

Ten thousan' ghosts o' that bloody day was marchin'   

through his brain   

An' his feet they kind o' picked their way as if   

they felt the slain. 

An' I grabbed his hand, an' says I to Bill, "Don't   

ye 'member me ?   

I'm yer father—don't ye know me ? How frightened   

ye seem to be!"   

But the boy kep' a-whisperin' to himself, as if '  

twas all he knew, "  

God'll take o' you, Bill, God'll take care o'   

you."   

He's never known us since that day, nor his sweetheart,   

an' never will;   

Father an' mother an' sweetheart are all the same   

to Bill.   

An' he groans like a wounded soldier, sometimes   

the whole night through,   

An' we smooth his head, an' say: "Yes, Bill,   

He 'll surely take care o' you."   

Ye can stop a war in a minute, but when can ye   

stop the groans ?   

Fer ye've broke our hearts an' sapped our blood   

an' plucked away our bones.  

An' ye've filled our souls with bitterness that goes   

from sire to son,   

So ye best be kind o' careful down there in Washington.

I have no idea how old this is but it was in a Public Speaking book my teacher  had in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina in 1942 and I had to learn it, and present it at various civic clubs,school and church. It was not as long and it did not have any mention of the Civil War in it.

Whisperin Bill was Civil War story with references to battles of that war. My mother recited it about 1920-30.

This poem was used in a short film, I believe on tnt television on  monday or tuesday the 2nd or 3rd of November 2009. It was an amazing little film clip about a farmer plowing his field with an old work horse, when he was approached by a politician, who was asking for his vote. He told the politician if he wanted his vote, he would have to listen to the story about his son. He then commenced to tell him this poem :Whispering Bill: I dont know if you can get a copy of the short film, but for those who have been in any war, it is well worth the effort. Its a wonderful piece of poetry, with a lot of deep meaning.T
