## The Intellectual Shortcomings of Other People's Fields; or, See this Gauntlet? Consider it Dropped (But Politely, in Case I'm Mistaken)

I have a quick question regarding the status of Laura Mulvey’s concept of the gaze in film studies.

(_At this point, the hastily crafted “blog-work” cedes pride of place to something I wrote this afternoon.  Now you can account for the ungainly tonal shift you’re about to experience.  Were I not genuinely interested in hearing what you think of the following account of Lacanian influence in film studies, I would take this opportunity to wax free-association about the difference between this here parenthetical prose and what you see beyond its elliptical fortifications.  Now, where was I?_)

The first sentence of her most frequently cited article, “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,” clearly states its purview: “This paper intends to use psychoanalysis to discover where and how the fascination of film is reinforced by pre-existing patterns of fascination already at work within the individual subject and the social formations that have moulded him.”  Twenty years later, David Roberts summarizes her initial exposition of the male gaze in this essays as having two functions:

The first is narcissistic: male spectators gaze at the male subject they aspire to resemble.  The second is voyeuristic: the same spectators gaze at the female performers they desire to possess and subject.

In the thirty years between Mulvey’s article and Roberts’, the psychoanalytic framework has become invisible, so much so that Roberts can claim that “however [her] ideas are challenged or inflected, they say something important.”  The means by which they do so—the authority of psychoanalytic accounts of human consciousness and social interaction—exist now only subterraneously.  

What had been a decidedly Lacanian argument in which film, abetted by the gaze and its imagined mastery, functions like the mirror stage, deceiving the viewer into believing there is no underlying symbolic structure, becomes a truism whose assumptions need not be addressed so long as the results of its application “say something important.”  Such a subsumption has consequences both for the theory being subsumed and the work to which it is applied.
