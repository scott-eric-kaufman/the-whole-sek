Aside from the fact that the cast credit doesn't match the person, I don't see it. But aside from recognizing "Buffy", I couldn't tell you anything about the context. Fanboi hlp, plz?

Buffy's last name was "Summers".

"Tara" was a major character in the Buffyverse. Although very close to the Summers girls to the point of being family, she did not actually share a last name with them.

Seeing "Tara Summers" displayed below Sarah Michelle Geller (who will probably be forever known as "Buffy Summers"), almost as if it is naming the character for the audience, is I think the definition of uncanny.
