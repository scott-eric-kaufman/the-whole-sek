## When the Heart Beats, Bruise It; or Part the Second of an Interminable Series on Evaluative Criticism

The responses to my initial offering cloud (through no fault but my own) the issue more than I'd already managed to: [Rich](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/on\_evaluative\_c.html#comment-10407960) reaches for the universal, [Luther](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/on\_evaluative\_c.html#comment-10408976) points to the particular and [Stephen](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/on\_evaluative\_c.html#comment-10408518) goes Goebbels.  To my tired eyes, I think the strongest account mashes their three incommensurable ones into a single incoherent whole: the particular qualities of a literary text woo the reader into thinking in familiar enough terms while simultaneously challenging those same terms which render them communicable.  

What are those terms?  Why does every evaluative critic consider Shakespeare an achievement and the latest _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ beneath consideration?  Because both accomplish what they intend to accomplish: Shakespeare produced entertaining comedies and tragedies of value commensurate with that of his sources and the _DSM-IV_'s multiaxial analytic guides mental health professionals through the biological, psychodynamic, cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal and familial contexts responsible for mental disease, defect or disorder.   
The Shakespearian corpus, however, need not correspond to reality as must the _DSM-IV_.  This obvious but essential difference pays immediate dividends for my argument (whatever it will turn out to be) because it dispenses with the need for the creative work to refer in any empirical sense to the world.  Call this "the First Fuzziness."  (More fuzziness, intentionally or otherwise, will no doubt follow.)  Unburdened of the need to be referential, the work of literature can address whatever world it wants in whatever manner it sees fit.  A work which addresses neither a recognizable world nor recognizable human relations will either be entirely unintelligible as an act of communication (think post electro-shock therapy [Artaud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artaud)) or a highly suggestive but never specific or entirely effective simulation.  A book like _Finnegans Wake_ has one foot squarely planted on both sides of this unintelligibility border, but one foot remains (albeit barely) within human ken.  It challenges the human ability to produce and understand language without ever exceeding it. 

Here Luther's "stupid rhetorical question" becomes critical: if the critic wants to mirror the sciences, then a work like the _Wake_ interests as a technical achievement made possible by contingent circumstances at a particular historical moment in a particular neurobiological environment; if the critic wants to parrot the arts, then a work like the _Wake_ becomes an occasion to produce criticism in the style of the _Wake_ (or at the very least informed by it).  I think this dilemma has horns too wide for human arms.  To grab one requires the other be released.  This decision seems unreasonable because literary scholars imagine, by professional proxy if not personally, that the line between the two exists for one reason and one reason only: for people like literary scholars to toe.  

What we need then is a governing system we all feel free to violate the moment its restraints chafe more than usual.  But we need the system and the restraints and the chafing for the show to whiz-bang.  Now keep in mind that I'm ignoring the entire history of aesthetics here so that I might build, from the ground up, my own theory of literary value based on chafing.  "Arms run red with strawberries are the ideal product of the aesthetic encounter," I want to be able to declare definitively.  

But I cannot.  I fear that if I focus much longer on this topic I'll feel compelled to enter a complicated discussion begun centuries before my birth and not nearly concluded yet, _i.e._ I'll have to read many pages of books which have little to do with my dissertation.  But I'd rather invent my own system (predicated on refined chafing) and this is _not_ because I  spent the last few weeks' worth of witching hours reading George Eliot.  Eliot demonstrates that didacticism can live happily within a novel whose worldview denies its cramped validity: the telepath whose actions signal he places more faith in phrenology than telepathy can barely navigate a world in which he knows what everyone thinks but cannot decide whether he knows who they are—as in _The Lifted Veil_—symbolizes my dilemma:

I know "the literary" when I hear it talking in my head, but I don't feel comfortable defining it until I can get my hands on its head and "read" it in accordance with the strictures of my pseudo-science.  I am espousing rigor without method here, in case you're wondering, because I believe myself capable of no better at this moment.  But  at least I share my fears of inadequacy with George Eliot.

I can't remember the name of it now, but there's a complicated procedure from mathematics or one of the sciences or perhaps philosophy that I think that literary studies needs for the purpose of evaluative criticism.  The procedure goes: you start by exploring the range of likely theories, you determine that for practical purposes it doesn't really matter which one you hold, and you use this as a reason to be able to go ahead without trying to test which one is really true.  In a sense, that's what I was trying to do with my story about the scientists and the elephantiasis, to point out that under a wide range of possible explanations, you really should be able to make evaluative judgements with some confidence that other people will find them meaningful.  Even if you don't really understand how this happens.  So it really may not matter whether the science is pseudo or not.

These kind of theories also suggest that while art itself "dispenses with the need for the creative work to refer in any empirical sense to the world", evaluative criticism does not; it implicitly consists of statements about people, not statements about art.  When you say that someone has written a great new work, what you mean is that person has found a new way to appeal to some human potentiality (whether biological or sociological or cultural doesn't really matter).

The reason I've thought about this to this extent is that I find it rather odd that literary studies is so clueless about whether it can evaluate, having been so focused on evaluation previously.  That's an unusual progression in a field of knowledge; the closest historical comparision I can think of is a certain stage in the development of medicine, in which doctors discovered that their old remedies really didn't work before they discovered any that did.  A generation of doctors were taught that all they really had was bedside manner and a few simple things.  And of course part of the bedside manner was not telling non-doctors that nothing they had would work.  It seems like a good comparison.

An interesting or at least creepy thing happens as the scrupulously imaginative fiction writer more and more closely observes the inner states of their carefully particularized characters: the characters become universals.

Similarly, a critic who tries to carefully describe a work turns out to produce something oddly similar to that produced by a critic who tries to carefully describe the effect of a work: that is, something worthless as a consumer guide but which some of us still find worthwhile.

In both cases, what we notice, and therefore what we carefully note, swamps anything as thin as reader identification or a buying decision. The task of love swamps any question of liking.

Back when I used to write things that were published as reviews, editors would receive complaints that subscribers couldn't tell if I was recommending the work or not. Such a weird idea, though. Like waiting for someone to recommend the next breath. Or saying "You simply \*must\* sleep with my spouse!"

When you've carefully studied and tried to describe a text, you've never come to a considered judgement that it's a failure at what it seems to be trying to do?  Or that it's trivial?

Well, there are a couple of ways to make those judgments, Rich.

One way is that the failure or triviality is blatant and dull. In which case, if I had been capable of noticing said failure or triviality, I wouldn't have been able to carefully study or describe the text because I'm an undisciplined lazy bastard.

Another way is that the failure seemed to hit at something essential or amusing or at least interesting enough to keep me involved, or that it turned out that triviality isn't such a horrible sin in the grand scheme of heat death / implosion / Last Days / proletariat dictatorship / End of History things. In which case, "failure" or "triviality" aside, I would probably end up "recommending" the text. My own failures and trivialities should be so good.

Sometimes -- rarely, these days -- the main thing I want to say is that I'm angry, but that's more likely to be anger about modish interpretations of texts than about texts themselves. Some of my most satisfying movie pans were of movies I didn't see.

Interesting.  With me I'm generally motivated to do this when I'm reading a bad book by an author who I usually like very much.  

But I think that the larger issue is that there are evaluative categories that go beyond "good" or "not good".  You can form the judgement that something is an entertaining failure and, if your only purpose is to produce a recommendation, recommend that people read it only if they've already read other specified books in its sub-genre that are not failures.
