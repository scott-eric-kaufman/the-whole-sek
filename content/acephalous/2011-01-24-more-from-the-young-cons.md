We've [laughed at the Young Cons before](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/06/the-young-cons-believe-the-bible-is-relatively-silent-on-issues-relating-to-supplyside-economics.html), and now they give us reason to again:





The only thing I'll say is, "Isn't it not at all revealing about conservative ideology who they choose to represent liberals being emotional?"

\*Yes, I know the video's old, but mockery is forever.  That's what the Internet's for, right?

Is it just me or is the posture, finger pointing, and expressions that one dude makes while leaning over and into one of the women the exact same posture, finger pointing, and expressions that bros make when explaining to a woman how she is a bitch for not going home with him?

Something's bugging me about this, and it's not the "quality" issue. The attempt to link 'rational' with 'conservative' is very nearly a complete inversion of the Enlightenment, and certainly a very odd position to take in a movement which has consistently resisted 20th century social science (and 19th century natural science) in the name of self-centered economism. 

It's a much more disturbing move, rhetorically, than the lame attempt to invoke hypermasculinity by coopting a musical form with a well-earned reputation for misogyny.

They're certainly a pair of "cons" and the most disturbing fact about that video is that they're wearing the symbols of two great FDR Democrats as if they are their heroes.

Didn't Aaron McGruder once get in trouble for a comic that said, 'The Young Cons Should Be Beaten by Raekwon the Chef With a Spiked Bat, A Critical Look at Rapping Conservatives'?
