## Vote <em>Acephalous</em> for Best 2501-3000

I want pointless awards.  You want me to win them.  [Vote for me](http://2007.weblogawards.org/polls/best-of-the-top-2501-3500-blogs-1.php).  

My campaign lacks a slogan.  I have one, actually, but it needs improving:
A vote for me is like a kiss from your mother.  (And you _like_ that, don't you?)

Did I say "improving"?  I meant "replacing."  Help would be appreciated.

How about:   

A vote for Scott is like a kiss from Scott's mother.

Snap! Hey, are you watching LSU-Alabama tomorrow? 1) I come from a long line of Crimson Tide fans, and 2) Ruth is at a conference, meaning I have nothing much going on tomorrow afternoon, so that may be one of like two college football games I watch this year.

New slogan: "Scott lost [$2600](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/cashier.html).  But winning 2501-3000 might put him ahead!"

Scott Eric Kaufmen: Sexy, Enticing, Kinky.

Ever wanted to know what your teachers say behind your backs? A vote for Acephalous guarantees that chance.

Nah, I don't know.

not to be a stickler for the truth, a parking lot crusader of pravda or anything, but technically the category is The Best 2501-3500 - i voted for the hippie, just to motivate the troops: Acephalous is seriously lagging behind...

By the way, KC Johnson's Durham-in-Wonderland is in the next category _down_.  Take that, thou soulless minion of orthodoxy!

What's Scott got?  He's got _the lot!_

Go to work on an Eric.

I scream, you scream, we _all_ scream for Ace's cream.

2501-3000: this is the dawning of the Age of Acephalous!

[that last one really needs to be _sung_...]

I have a jingle for you, Scott:

"When you morons vote for me,  

You can say you vote acephalously!"

(It's the Roto-Rooter ditty)

Anyway, I voted for you.
