## I should probably explain . . .

			. . . [this](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/09/welcome-aboard.html).  But as I like this definition by Tom better than mine, I'm running with it instead:

Since SEK eventually writes at any given blog I happen to read,\* if I start reading, say, _The Corner_ on a regular basis, it is inevitable that one day SEK will be blogging there. Which means that we can—simply by reading conservative blogs—turn the entire wingnut blogosphere in a bastion of literary criticism interested in Darwinian rhetoric, comic books, and dismantling incredibly dumb arguments made by those very same conservatives. Go, Scott, go!

\*What I will now call SEK'S Law, a variation on Godwin's Law: "As a blog's lifespan grows longer, the probability of SEK becoming a regular contributor approaches 1."

I'm going to have to put all your blogs in a separate folder in my bloglines accounts. There's no point in denying that I'm only reading them because you show up.... (Seriously, as much fun as I have over at Edge of the West, I only became a regular there because the interesting conversations on your posts were happening there instead of hear)

No offense, I hope, if I can't keep up with your prodigious output.  Do you fear that the more you write, the less you'll say (let's call this the law of 24-hour news and bi-weekly op-eds)?  For example, do you think that your recent forays into political polemics have the same brilliantly bemused prose style of "Acephalous: The Early Years"?  I'm thrilled with your success, it goes without saying, and I wish you luck.

Luke,

I'm not writing more---let me start again: I'm not writing more _online_, in fact less, not even a post per day anymore.  The majority of my prose is devoted to job applications, the book, revising bits of the dissertation for publication and the whole into a manuscript, and the various obligations that come with teaching three classes.  So if I don't sound bemused anymore, well, it's because it's difficult to maintain a state of bemusement while under constant strain.  I _wish_ I was back in that place where I taught one class and worked on the dissertation, as that left me with more energy, mental and otherwise.  So no, I'm not offended, and no, I don't think I write like I once did.  I will say this, though: the political writing is more of a struggle, and you're probably noticing the strain, but if you don't struggle as a writer, you're not improving as one.  (Yes, I know everyone believes the more they write the better writer they are, irrespective of independent-type analysis, but there you are---I mean, there I am.)

The Thompson-esque post (published days after this one) serves as a rejoinder to my comment in some ways.  And, in addition, I think your response is more thoughtful than perhaps I deserved.  I'm in "that place" with one class, and little structured responsibility, and instead of writing 500 words a day, I'm too mentally exhausted to even form blog sentences.  Anyway, soldier on, you have plenty of avid readers.  I'd hate to see you go out like Fafblog.

More than anything else, you voiced some of the doubts that have crept in now that market-season is upon us.  I'm not in your "that place," but I'm certainly in a place like that---comprehensively-structured time is as bad as utterly unstructured in terms of trying to be productive.  I tend not to function well without some semblance of balance, and I currently have none.  Plus, my nine-year-old cichlid named Charlie Brown died, so I might have been a little irritable.  (You probably remember that I don't handle death well.)  But I'm not going to lurch in and out of existence like Giblets and company, whose real life jobs and other blogs are, I take it, keeping them of their precious interwebs.
