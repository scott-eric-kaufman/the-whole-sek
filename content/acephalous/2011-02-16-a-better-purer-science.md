## A Better, Purer Science

As someone who wrote a dissertation entitled “Maximal Diversity: Non-Darwinian Evolutionary Theory in American  Fiction, 1895-1910,” I can’t help but lend my full support to [this bill](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/kern-introduces-creationist-bill-so-science-teachers-can-teach-pure-science):

Oklahoma state Rep. Sally Kern wants to make it clear  that her new legislation protecting the rights of science teachers to  “teach all science instead of just the Darwin model” is in no way an  attempt to introduce creationism or Intelligent Design into the  classroom.  It is, in fact, just an attempt to let teachers teach “pure  science” about “all of evolution”

No student in Oklahoma can possibly understand the modern world  without a firm grasp of heterogenesis, Lamarkian inheritance,  kinetogenesis, orthogenesis, metakinesis, geographic isolation, biologic  isolation, the Baldwin effect, organic selection, and orthoplasty, to  name but a few.  To stick to those strains of evolutionary theory that  Morse Peckham called “Darwinisticistic” is a travesty against science  and democracy that can only be rectified by the State of Oklahoma  commissioning to write a textbook for many moneys.

Did you mean to say "commissioning many monkeys to write a textbook"?

So, have you ever ran across a book called [Darwinian Conservatism](http://www.amazon.com/Darwinian-Conservatism-Societas-Larry-Arnhart/dp/0907845991) in your research? If so, what did you think of it?

@John: I always really mean monkeys. 

@Jake: I have, actually, via regular commenter KWK.  It's not the most convincing line of reasoning, though I say that as a general impression, not as a result of a serious scholarly engagement with it.  (By the time KWK showed me that book, I'd long been sick of my dissertation and treated it with a respect undeserved.)
