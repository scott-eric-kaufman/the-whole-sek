## Saturday Self-Indulgence I

So last night was a total disaster.  Everyone stared at me wondering who I was mocking.  I seemed to be a raving anti-everythingist of the worstest sort.  I only meant to mock neo-Nazis though.  It went so terribly terribly wrong because my typical mode o' mockery is inhabitation and infiltration.  To insult from the inside with complete disregard for what others think of you is my _modus operandi_.  I watch [_The Office_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=external-search%!F(MISSING)search-type=ss%!i(MISSING)ndex=dvd%!k(MISSING)eyword=the%!o(MISSING)ffice%!)(MISSING)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) and consider Gervais a god among men . . . because His is The Only Way to deprive 'em of all dignity.  Only it takes a surer hand or steadier set of fingers to pull it off.  

So I apologize.  I really only meant to belittle some Nazis by turning them into old Jews.  I'm on a roll this week though.  I'm offending [everyone](http://etaliae.blogspot.com/2006/02/odds-ends-silver-linings.html) I otherwise agree with for no particular reason.  I could examine in detail the reasons for my failures . . . but I'd rather not tonight.  Instead I'm throwing you what I christen "Saturday Self-Indulgence."  Because no one reads blogs on the weekend.  Most of you are too busy leading your weekend lives.  The ones you dream about as you do all you can to keep your head off your desk and your boss off your back.  You know . . . the days you sneak a second to see what I had to say about something important.  Weekdays my words wash away the daily drudge for select sacred moments.  Weekdays I'm the [violent fantasy life](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)B00003W8NM)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) you don't want your therapist to know about.  

Weekdays I'm modest to boot.  

So I'll spend Saturday "sharing."  The first thing I'll share is that today's my brother's birthday.  He won't answer my phone calls or reply to emails or even respond to [my](http://theinnersanctum.typepad.com/the\_inner\_sanctum/2006/02/beware\_the\_new\_.html#comment-14369113) [comments](http://theinnersanctum.typepad.com/the\_inner\_sanctum/2006/02/beware\_the\_new\_.html#comment-14372674) on [his blog](http://theinnersanctum.typepad.com/the\_inner\_sanctum/) . . . but I wish him a happy birthday nonetheless.  What can I say?  I put the "big" in "big brother."

I've been listening to the newish [Fiona Apple](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link\_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%!A(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)%!F(MISSING)www.amazon.com%!F(MISSING)gp%!F(MISSING)product%!F(MISSING)B000B0WOEO)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1) album.  The cover disgusts me in ways I can't explain.  They have to do with this photoshopped image of a human and a lotus plant which was ostensibly a woman who'd been infected by some parasite . . . and I'd link to it but I don't want that image back in my head.  If I said that that image stole countless sleeping hours from me I wouldn't be exaggerating.  Sometimes images lodge in my head and I can't fight them out for the life of me.  Even my patented sleep technology\* can't defeat it.  So no link.  But you can see an unhealthy approximation on the Fiona Apple album.  

Kevin's nominated me for "[Worst Soon to be Professor](http://www.slanttruth.kaelliott.com/2006/02/worst\_soon\_to\_b.html)."  That's only fair.  I'm the force responsible for [Michael](http://www.michaelberube.com/)'s dangerous terribility.  Without me people'd think Chomsky [a greater danger](http://www.frontpagemag.com/survey/vote.asp).  

Two of my three Honors Dissertation advisors have emailed drafts of their current work this week.  Sadly this makes me feel like an adult.  But it also makes me feel like an undergraduate again.  I've commented on both Pat McGee and John Protevi's latest work . . . but I can't send them my comments until I'm absolutely positively convinced that what I've written isn't complete crap.  I'm sure this is something I'll overcome someday.  But for now I still idolize those two and can't bring myself to send my impressions.  Soon though.  (I'm fairly certain both read me regularly.  I hope they get this far and understand why I haven't responded yet.)

Finally, [Belle](http://lawandletters.blogspot.com/) took the bar exam this week and thinks she passed.  Congratulations are in order!  So cough 'em up!  (What can I say?  I'm a believer.  If people as intelligent as she manifestly is think they passed then they passed.  The exceptions to this rule are so rare they only prove it.)

\*One
 time at baseball camp they brought in an instructor to help us "visualize" our swing.  They'd
taped us swinging from three angles, stuck us in front of a VCR and
told us to memorize what we were doing and the order in which we were
doing it.  "Lift front foot and begin to slide it slowly" &c.  
Then

a hitting instructor finds the flaws in it, tells us how to fix them,
and informs us that we're to "visualize" our "perfect" swing over and
over and over again.  To this day it knocks me out after about four iterations.  Sometimes I
vary it by thinking about my jump shot, but really, the swing is solid gold. 
I'm like Wolverine: thirty seconds (alright, more like three minutes)
and I'm out like a light.  
But only if I can concentrate. If I'm sick and/or drunk, I'm
lifting my right foot, releasing my left hand, launching the bat
instead of the ball . . .

I love your faith in me. For the record though, for aspiring lawyers everywhere, (and since lawyers always give qualified, non-committal statements) I will say I think I did comparatively okay in the sense that I 1) didn't puke, 2) didn't pass out, and 3) didn't completely break down, and that typically, attitude is better than anything else on the bar. But I'll take the "I think I passed!" Just don't hold me to it when the results come in (which I will freaking not care about, since I'm going to grad school!) 

I'm glad to be back, and I'm glad you're done with grading, and yes, glad you're being self-indulgent and writing whatever comes to mind (better you than The Troll of Sorrow). The exercise of writing is important--and your faithful readers will get you and stick with you. Hell, not like I always understand your posts filed under the categories "Academia, Dissertation, Evolution, Literary Theory"--but by gum, I read and I try.  Though I dug last night's. Knowing that you're Jewish, I understood who you were mocking. Not like Prince Harry with the Swastika. (what was up with that? And why do the British have "Imperialist and Colonialist" theme parties? Can't they just show up in tees and jeans as themselves then?)

We Brits have no 'ourselves' to turn up as.  Not that I'm condoning Imperialist and Colonialist parties: plain rude, that.  But jeans and tees?  Puh-lease.

There are people like me who do in fact read you on the weekend (hi, have you checked your viewership count?) and who actually appreciate these sorts of posts because of their non-academic nature (hey, i don't know a lot of stuff and you're kind of over my head sometimes), and, at the same time, there are people who know you to be overtly anti-discriminative on every level so...

Why apologize?

Academically, you're what some of us aspire to.  Could we sit in a room as a mostly muted TA yet still maintain such an underlying pedagogical presence?  Unlikely.   

Personally, could we (I) have any more momentary camraderie with you in light of the fact that you're listening to the album that pretty much defined our (my) past six months?  

I should go to bed.  But listen and re-listen and love track #4...'i am likely to miss the main event...if i stop to cry and complain again..."

So sorry Adam--an unfunny remark that came off terribly. I should have limited the snarky commentary to the British monarchy or Prince Harry, and even then the monarchy and Harry aren't responsible for the actions of King James I or Sir Robert Clive.  Nor did I mean to imply that there is a monolithic British culture/people to which all actions, historical, present and future can be attributed--any more than there is a monolithic "American" people (despite what the melting pot theory says). Again, many apologies for an ill-considered late night flippant remark.

Dear Belle Lettre; _please_ don't apologise! You've no reason to at all; I feel stupid for trying to post in the idiom of 'brief, witty' and in ending up posting in 'stupidly grumpy for no reason' instead.  The fault, it mine.

Hi Scott - I recently joined your readership from over in Anat&Neurobio - I don't really think you need to apologize, indeed, EVER need apologize for trying to be funny (or for mocking neo-nazis).  Failing to be funny on the other hand...  Well, suffice it to say that too few of us have any childhood memories of immigrant Jews to provide context!  Still, better to make a bad joke than no joke at all.
