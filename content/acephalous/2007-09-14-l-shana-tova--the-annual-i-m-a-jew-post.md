Another correspondent alerts me of the existence of [this](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002Y1VZM/diesekoschmar-20) bumper sticker.Â  

In addition to vindicating [analogy bans](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week\_2006\_12\_03.html#005891), it provides the single best Amazon category ever: 
[Amazon.com: Jews: Automotive](http://www.google.com/search?q=%!I(MISSING)%!L(MISSING)L+FORGIVE+JANE+FONDA+WHEN+THE+JEWS+FORGIVE+HITLER%!)(MISSING)

Surprisingly, Amazon seems to have none of [these](http://www.ajudaica.com/category/13/Car+Mezuzah) in stock.

When first glancing at this post, I thought the joke was going to be something along the lines of "Amazon.com is to Jews as automotive is to X?"  I was really, really curious what X was going to be.  Sigh.

Amazon.com is to Jews as automotive is to ... a Volkswagen Rabbi?

Hah. Ok not a fun game really.

[This](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=9820) is interesting though. Yes, Virginia, there is anti-Semitism here.
