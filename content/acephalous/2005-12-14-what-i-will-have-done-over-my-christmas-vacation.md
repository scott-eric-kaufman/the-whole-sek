## What I Will Have Done Over My Christmas "Vacation"

A vacation?  What would that be?  A week in which you only think about your work instead of reading and writing about it?  Some vacation.  People think the academic life akin to the fine Southern tradition of sipping spirits on the long porch as the sun sets.  Not quite.  Between the moment I submit my grades and January 6th I will:

*   Read every available article written by the panelists whose talks I will attend at the MLA so that when I work up the nerve to ask a question they won't assume they're being punk'd.
*   Attend the MLA.  Schmooze.  Punk [Michael Bérubé](http://www.michaelberube.com/).
*   Polish a nearly complete dissertation chapter on Silas Weir Mitchell and his evolutionarily-informed account of the Revolutionary War and its aftermath.
*   Begin researching a dissertation chapter either on 1) utopianism and evolutionary thought in which I revisit the classic critical works about utopian thinking and smack 'em around for their social Darwinian assumptions or 2) race and evolutionary thought in popular literature and academic sociology.  Shut it.  There is logic there.
*   Edit a manuscript I've been itching to read since it arrived but had to put aside because there are only so many hours in a day and my students had purchase on most of them.
*   Learn Adobe InDesign.  Create a template for the Valve's publishing venture.  Begin bothering people to edit their contributions. *   Read for pleasure.  Just kidding.
*   Spend time with friends and family whose Christmas gifts have been purchased online and are being mailed to my parents' house in Houston.
*   Inform parents not to open Amazon boxes which arrive lest they ruin Christmas for terminal orphans the world over.
*   Blog.  Blog.  Blog.

I'm not complaining.  I love this life and couldn't imagine living another.  My days and nights are spent thinking supremely deep thoughts about singularly important stuff.  What more could I want out of life?

You're going to casually learn Adobe InDesign?  You are either delusional or highly gifted.  Or have previous desktop publishing software experience, I guess.  I can't even figure out how to put pictures into OpenOffice and get them to come out the right size.

I've been playing around for a while now trying to get a book with pictures in it together for Lulu.com publication.  Each time I come back to it I quickly realize that learning how to format the thing is going to take the same kind of energy as work does (which commenting on blogs, clearly, does not) and therefore take tremendous amounts of time that could be spent helping people figure out which pollutants from military bases are getting into groundwater or something.  I could pay someone to do it, but $400 or so while in theory affordable seems like overkill for the 6 copies of the book that I expect to "sell".  So I'm stuck.  If anyone out there has any advice (free or cheap software plus really good tutorial, perhaps?), please feel free.

I earn a living wage, Luke.  You must live in a city or something.  Or not have a union.  Or not have lucked into a sweet deal in a decent department.  Or have a social life.  Or don't have a wife whose salary equals yours.  Or don't have and/or want children.  Or health insurance.  Or a working car.  

Seriously, all you whiners piss me off.

Rich, I didn't say I would "casually" learn InDesign.  I said I'd learn it.  Nothing casual about it.  Check its tome out of the library.  Sit down and spend an hour a day working through it chapter by chapter.  Eventually finish it and have an idea how to work the basics.  Build on that.  I am a quick study with computer programs, however, so I think I'll be able to whip _something_ up in a month.  We'll see.  Feel free to point and laugh when I fail.

I like the distinction between 'punk'd' and (presumably) 'punk_ed_', to rhyme with 'what are we going to do with Ed? I think we should _flunk Ed_.  Perhaps one is more acceptable to MLA panellists than the other?  Although it seems to me that academics presenting at the MLA should be grateful that anybody is reading their stuff at all.

Me: I plan to spend this vacation staging my suicide from a snow-bound bridge so as to tempt down my guardian angel so he can show me how things in London (and the London area) would have worked out had I never been born.  I'm curious, that's all.

Please don't ever use "punk" as a verb.

Ramona's asleep, Stephen.  You know how when you didn't drive her that summer you were in Canada and she fell asleep?  She did it again. Kelly's going to bang some pots and pans by her head tomorrow.  If that fails, we're going to throw her in the tub then dump a toaster in there.  

Adam, I didn't realize [Ashton Kutchor](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361227/) a solely American phenomenon.  How long does it take to cross that ocean, anyway?  Are your comments like the light from long dead stars, having journeyed millions of years over an unimaginable abyss to reach me?  

The Google link to the Wikipedia page raises some interesting usage questions:

The show has spawned the catchphrase "You just got punk'd" ... The victim will then say to the camera "I've just been punk'd".

Jonathan, I'm sorry, but the people have declared in one voice that "punk" is a verb.  And by "people" I mean "Ezra Pound":

You lay back, you let me have the whole stinking sweat of providing the mechanical means for letting through the new movement... Then you punk out, cursing me for not being in two places at once, and for ‘seeing no alternative to my own groove’.

That's intransitive.

You didn't specify.  Plus, people shouldn't complain about lexical niceties on a blog.

Jodi and Ben, _you_ can complain about lexical niceties here because you were polite to ask permission before doing so.  

Part of this stems from my years as a linguistics major, toiling away at descriptive grammar and learning to love the evolution of language.  I don't mind if "punk" verbifies into an intransitive.  In fact, I love it.  I verb all the time, and I wager Jonathan does to . . . he's just too high and mighty to allow a _popular_ verbed noun enter the lexicon.

I am informed and educated about Ashton K; I thank you.  Though the imdb link doesn't explain why the 'e' in 'punked' must be replaced with an apostrophe.

That sort of thing bothers me more than verbalising intransivitity.  A strange reflection upon my character perhaps.
