			As I read [Amardeep](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/theor/)'s contribution to the [Spivak](http://www.long-sunday.net/spivak/) [MMTOR](http://crookedtimber.org/2005/07/12/massive-multi-thinker-online-reviews/) (to which I will contribute when time and dissertation committee permit) I had one of _those_ moments.  You know the ones:  

You're walking home from class, grousing under your breath about the "progress" you made on your dissertation yesterday, then suddenly something clicks when you think you hear [Karen O](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000EHQ7L0/diesekoschmar-20) screaming something which sounds surprisingly like "[ZORK](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/disadventure.html)!"  

Tonight's random confluence comes from a click "overhead" as I read Amardeep's post.  I had been thinking about how to reply to [Belle Lettre](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/in\_his\_1985\_soc.html#comment-16314994) and [N. Pepperell](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/in\_his\_1985\_soc.html#comment-16349981)'s comments on something I wrote in [an exaggerated fit of annoyance](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/in\_his\_1985\_soc.html) about the idea of "a useable past."  The unacknowledged cherry atop my conceptual complaint had been the feather-fluffing prose in which these historical distortions declaimed.  I thought I'd write a sarcastic "Note to Self" about new regulations limiting the number of unchecked facts [OSHA](http://www.osha.gov/) allows one to balance simultaneously on a soap box.  I'd outline the regulations in bureaucratic detail and lull the majority of my audience into a stupor . . . so I ranted instead.  

As my prosopalgic complaints accumulated my prosodic ones dropped from sight.  All conceptual headache and no complaints about rhetoric!  What was I thinking?  

This.  Such were the thoughts my mind's eye lazily half-scanned as I read Amardeep's post after a day of relentless dissertating . . . then it clicked.  Endless thought about the _Origin of Species_ had organized an opinion on academic jargon with little or no intervention from my preoccupied mind!
