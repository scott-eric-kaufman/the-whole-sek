On this day in 1888, Vincent Van Gogh chopped off his left ear so that people might recognize him as the chap in [this painting](http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/image.aspx?fn=images/0529.jpg), but nobody cares about that. What people really care about is the illustrious list of people born on 23 December, including:

*   **1805:** Joseph Smith, the first Mormon*   **1862:** Connie Mack, a stadium
*   **1926:** Robert Bly, a "talented" "poet"
*   **1942:** Harry Shearer, a talent
*   **1942:** John Peterman, a running gag
*   **1944:** Wesley Clark, not a VP
*   **1946:** Susan Lucci, a loser
*   **1952:** William Kristol, a loser

*   **1964:** Eddie Vedder, Eddie Vedder!
*   **1964:** Slash, Slash!
*   **1967:** Carla Bruni, first lady of France
*   **1971:** Corey Haim, a Corey
*   **1976:** Scott Eric Kaufman, a me
*   **1983:** Hanley Ramirez, the second-best SS in the National League East

Happy Birthday, Scott!

[I thought the lack of commentary on the first item shows excellent restraint....]

Happy birthday you!

This must have been a somewhat challenging birthday to have, growing up.  On the one hand, sharing a birthday with Corey haim must have been big for you in Junior High.  On the other hand, every few years your birthday would have fallen on some random night of Hanukah, and then no one would remember to buy you extra crappy presents.

Actually, doing the math, you must have been in grade school at the height of Coreydom.  And still no ponicorns for you.
