## Tom & Joe, <em>This</em> is How You Read a Poem

[Tom](http://tomemos.wordpress.com/2007/05/21/aristotle-was-not-belgian/) and [Joe](http://kugelmass.wordpress.com/2007/05/22/getting-lincoln-wrong-ann-althouse-the-new-york-times-and-the-american-student/) decided to challenge [Ann Althouse](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/dont-know-much-about-history.html) to a reading competition, to which I can only say: "Unwise, my friends, unwise."  Ann Althouse is a _lawyer_.  You guys are _graduate students_.  Moreover, you two are playing on her turf.  Abraham Lincoln was a _lawyer_, not a _graduate student_.  Not that you could take her on yours, mind you.  See, for example, her [magisterial display of intertextual prowess](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/notes-in-preparation-for-second-viewing.html), in which she pairs an episode of _The Sopranos_ with the most literal poem in human history, W.B. Yeats' "The Second Coming":
You need to study the poem as you rewatch the episode. It's not enought
to say "Things fall apart ... Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world," so
there's going to be an all-out war between Tony and Phil. Or "somewhere
in sands of the desert ... what rough beast ... Slouches towards
Bethlehem," so all that talk about the Mideast and terrorism is going
to have to be part of the series dénouement. There must be endless
depths there. You're just getting started.

Perhaps Tony will
find his humanity (or is he the "rough beast"?). He gives an expensive
watch to Carmela, which is typical for him, but what was that
inscription? He tries to connect with the guys talking about his peyote
visions, but he fails. He tells Phil he wants to talk to him "on a
human level." Which also fails. He saves his son from drowning.
("blood-dimmed tide... innocence is drowned.") The water imagery from
last week. He cradles the son he saves. Mother imagery from last week.
He starts saying "poor you," the way his own mother Livia did. More
mother references. Before saving his son from drowning, he eats the
"Lincoln log" food Carmela made to try cheer up A.J. Imagery carried
over from last week: mother, phallus, assassinated President.

Consider yourself pre-schooled.  Let me walk you dolts through this brilliance one brilliant sentence at a brilliant time:
_You need to study the poem as you rewatch the episode ..._ 

... with a law degree in one hand, a glass of wine in the other.  

_It's not enough
to say "Things fall apart ... Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world," so
there's going to be an all-out war between Tony and Phil._ 

Because Tony and Phil are "the world," like in the poem you studiously studied, in which "things fall apart" and on which "anarchy is loosed."  (Ann's absolutely right to ignore the "mere."  It's a useless poetry word poets throw in when they need an extra beat.)

_Or "somewhere
in sands of the desert ... what rough beast ... Slouches towards
Bethlehem," so all that talk about the Mideast and terrorism is going
to have to be part of the series dénouement._

Deserts and Bethlehem are _both_ in the Middle East.  (So is the Spiritus Mundi, for that matter.)  
_  
There must be endless
depths there._ 

Word.  
_  
You're just getting started._

No, Ann, _you are_.  I but bask in your reflected glory.    
_  
Perhaps Tony will
find his humanity (or is he the "rough beast"?)._

See how perfectly this aligns with Yeats' intent?  Tony Soprano, small-time mobster, is exactly like the "rough beast" whose coming Yeats _celebrated_ in the dark aftermath of the First World War.  Who better to render judgment upon the citizens of New Jersey than Tony Soprano, a man who has been both rough _and_ beastly?  
_  
He saves his son from drowning.
("blood-dimmed tide... innocence is drowned.") The water imagery from
last week._ 

What, you thought imagery the exclusive provenance of literary critics?  As.  If.  Not only does she recognize it, she remembers where she recognizes it from.  She let this imagery live in her head for _a whole week_.  What it did in there is not for the likes of you or I to surmise.  
_  
He cradles the son he saves. Mother imagery from last week._ 

Do you see how much room she has in there?  Water _and_ mother imagery stayed with her.  If you had that much imagery in your head _at one time_, you wouldn't be able to brush your teeth, much less write about [_American Idol_](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/how-did-paula-abdul-break-her-nose.html), [herself](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/when-women-take-classes-in-tennis-wine.html), [dating](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/everyones-using-on-line-dating-services.html), [her theme song](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/audible-althouse-84.html), [law](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/its-not-kennedy-court-its-roberts-v.html), [herself](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/some-red-car-things.html) and [_American Idol_](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/american-idol-results-america-dont-take.html).  And yet:  

_Imagery carried
over from last week: mother, phallus, assassinated President._

How does she do it?  I don't know.  I just [thank God](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/espn\_coverage\_o.html) for putting her here to do it for me.

Wow, she uses the word "imagery" to mean the same thing my students think it means, which is whatever you "imagine" while you engage with a text; QED, poems are about everything.

Scott, thanks for the link. I was laughing out loud by the time we got here:

_Because Tony and Phil are "the world," like in the poem you studiously studied, in which "things fall apart" and on which "anarchy is loosed."  (Ann's absolutely right to ignore the "mere."  It's a useless poetry word poets throw in when they need an extra beat.)_

How a useless "reading" of Yeats and the death knell of fiction can sit together on one blog, in the same month, is one of those imponderables that science may never be able to answer.

Genius, Scott. Genius.  I'm too amused to be offended at the slight jab at lawyers. :-) 

I also have a law degree (or two), but I will never be able to match Althouse's reading skills. Then again, I am a graduate student. 

Word.

Ann Althouse also has the ability to [make Whitman cry](http://kugelmass.wordpress.com/2007/05/22/getting-lincoln-wrong-ann-althouse-the-new-york-times-and-the-american-student/#comment-4350).

LOL. You realize where you are is what is known as "The Althouse Vortex." Look it up. And enjoy your stay!

Question for you: Am I purporting to analyze the poem or to discern what the writers of "The Sopranos" mean to convey by quoting it?

Ann, since you like LOLs and other hip "Inter-tubes" (that's so funny!) phrases, there's this guy [named Alex](http://kugelmass.wordpress.com/2007/05/22/getting-lincoln-wrong-ann-althouse-the-new-york-times-and-the-american-student/#comment-4360) who you might like to meet.  I think that you must be of similar ages, by some criterion, and you might like watching American Idol together or something.  What price a vortex that causes the meeting of two sympathetic souls?

Ann,

If "the Althouse Vortex" is a place where a pleasurable half-hour can be spent mocking those in possession of an undeserved sense of superioty, not only am I there, I'm thinking about buying some land and settling down.  

As for your question for me: it's _possible_ you're claiming that the writers of a show you love are insanely over-literal readers of poetry, but I have my doubts.  There's no reason to praise a show you love by calling its writers idiots.  (At least, _I_ wouldn't do so.)

Alex, 

Nice save ... although I see that you don't actually _deny_ watching _American Idol_.  (That said, there are many people I wouldn't watch _American Idol_ with either.)

AWB, 

You know, I thought about linking to that post of yours, but didn't want to suggest Ann had taken LSD, as that could lead to a lawsuit.
