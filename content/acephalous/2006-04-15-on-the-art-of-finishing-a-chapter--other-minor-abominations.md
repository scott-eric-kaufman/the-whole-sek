## On the Art of Finishing a Chapter & Other Minor Abominations

About said art I know little, having finished a whopping two to this point.  As I refine the document on the right side of my screen by retyping the unpolished nonsense everywhere apparent in the draft open on the left, I'm consistently struck by the inelegance of my prose.  Will a reviewer one day argue for the usefulness of my work "despite its minor abominations of style," as Francis Sumner once said of Vernon Kellogg's.  Will he or she say
the style of the work is seriously marred by the cumbersomeness of many of the sentences.  The writer tells us how thoroughly he has delved in the German evolutionary literature of the day.  And of this his own style bears abundant witness.  The pages abound in lengthy and involved sentences, and parenthetical clauses, so much so as to threaten with aphasia the unfortunate one who many venture to read them aloud. (495)

Will he or she laugh when I write "a paragraph of twenty lines, constituted by a single sentence, composed of 17 words and containing two parentheses."  And while he or she is "mentioning these petty blemishes," will the "frequent dissonances in the word combinations employed . . . 'curiously nearly completely subjective'; 'more or less nearly entirely'; 'influence of extrinsic influences,' followed by a third 'influence' in the same sentence; 'readily directly'; 'practically generally'" among them, fall before my hypothetical reviewer's sharpened wit?  

If I don't spend the next 48 hours vigorously revising, I fear all signs my Magic 8-Ball returns will point to a perpetual "Yes."

Want to trade irrational paranoia?

Somewhat sadly, I think, it's unlikely that we'll find aesthetic criticism of your prose when your first book gets reviewed.  Instead, we'll see a half-accurate regurgitation of your argument, supplemented with the reviewer's own ideas on your topic and a few reasons why, if you had only considered x, y, and z, your book would have been much improved. The reviewer will concede that it is a useful addition to the scholarship, though much work remains to be done on the subject.

I understand your concern.  But given the quantity you have to write, and the complex internal resistances you're fighting to write it, you should take these problems in order of severity -- a ruthless triage.

True, repeating "influence" in a sentence can be inelegant (if the point isn't to make a parallel).  But that's a less urgent problem than the "influence of ... influences," which suffers a semantic slippage as well.  Yes, of course, there's no bright line between "aesthetic" and "semantic" problems of expression, but for the sake of getting done with the thing and putting the message across, one has to edit as if there were.  (Indeed, as if the "message" of the thing were different from the thing itself.)

I speak from experience in a different field -- but I think it applies.

If your writing in this particular case is as excellent as this post, have no fear...really.
