I'm not sure I like where this is headed.  Am I really this obsessed?  Will Google hold my "obsessions" against me?

This is sad. I had hoped for #1 for at least one of the following, but no dice.

necrobestiality (at #3)  

anthropophagous pigs (#2)  

monks medieval meat (#3)

Dammit!

I've never even _seen_ your office.

The proper inference is not that I had sex in your office blindfolded, either.

Isn't this "cheating"? I read that google remembers your previous searches and uses them to influence the results for your current search. Therefore if you search for your own material a lot, it becomes reinforcing. (whereas, if \_I\_ --- or a non-Acephalous reader --- searched "tentacle porn in my office" and got your site as number one, it would really say something.)

Another truly amazing thing is that the third link for "ben wolfson having sex in my office" begins with "only the purest balls for **my** daughter."

It's impossible to test these now, because Google has already indexed your site.  So of course you now show up as first for these exact phrases.

I think that I show up as the eighth Google hit for "murals", which seems pretty good for a single word.  Unless Google has customized my search as Sisyphus suggests.

Just to test: you're #8 for murals on my machine too. I'm sorry you ever had to live in LA. (btw, #1 for erotic animals, although it's not one of the posts I wrote).

Bummer. Google has improved its anti-me algorithm and I no longer show up as #1 for "Ray Davis" or "Tuesday Weld", which are what I used to tell people to search for so that I wouldn't have to spell "pseudopodium".

Ben Wolfson has pure balls? I'm confused. That seems unlikely.

Sisyphus, you'll be astonished to know that I'm all the way up to #6 for "tentacle porn in my office."  I suppose I should thank you for that?

Rich, the searches aren't exact (not in quotation marks), so I can only attribute my success to the Power of Acephalous.  (Motivational DVDs to follow shortly.)

Justin, what's _truly_ amazing is that Google [returns] (http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hs=pLp&pwst=1&q=+site:www.unfogged.com+ben+wolfson+having+sex+in+my+office) **350** Unfogged threads about ben having sex in my office.

"I suppose I should thank you for that?"

(modestly) I try my best. I'm a little disappointed it's only 6, though. 

BTW, Is your sky still pink and raining ash? We're contained over here, but I can't keep track on all the other fires. 

I'm hoping that the heat and the smokiness won't be so bad on my visit down your way.

A couple more gratuitous mentions of all the tentacle porn in my office ought to raise Google's awareness of my official tentacle-porniness ...

... as for my skies, yes, they're still strangely colored (more purplish than pink) and raining ash, but that's because the Santiago Fire's getting worse and worse.  The good news: it's headed north.  The bad news: more ash, still can't really breath.
