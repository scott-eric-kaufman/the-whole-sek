Seems I have a more marketable skill-set than I thought, because—should you pay me to send email—I wouldn't do this:

[![Noteventrying](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156eda70c2970c-pi "Noteventrying")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156eda70c2970c-pi)

Honestly, I'm not even sure _how_ to do that.  It's the kind of mistake only made someone who's never used email before—someone completely unlike me!  I send email all the time and would happily accept your money to send yours too.   (Just so you know.)

On the upside, they did give us tiny recycling bins.
