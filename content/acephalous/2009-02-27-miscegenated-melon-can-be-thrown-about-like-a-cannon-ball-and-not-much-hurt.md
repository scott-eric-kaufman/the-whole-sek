## Miscegenated Melon Can Be Thrown About Like a Cannon Ball and Not Much Hurt.

Over at _Edge of the American West_, I contextualize this:

It is next to impossible to teach many of the colored people of the
South that it is as wrong to steal a watermelon as a calf.  The colored
man will admit that the calf larceny deserves the severest penalty of
the law, and if he were on a jury, he would enforce it too; but let a
case of stolen melons come before a court, and he’ll stand up stoutly
for acquitted, and he is the delinquent, plead his innocence with an
injured air of being unjustly persecuted.
