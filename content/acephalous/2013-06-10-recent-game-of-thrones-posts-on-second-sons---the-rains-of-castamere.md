A few newer readers were having difficulty finding the _Game of Thrones_ specific
 information posted of late, and since our “tag” categories work as well
 as tagging “categories” does, I just thought I’d line the most recent 
ones up all in one place:

*   Here’s the [“Second Sons” podcast](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/05/second-sons-an-lgm-podcast-on-game-of-thrones-with-steven-attewell-and-sek) with [Steven Attewell](http://racefortheironthrone.wordpress.com/), in which I do an adequate job describing eyelines and their importance, which is what leads to:
*   The first of the so-called “[_Game of LASER TAG: You Win or You’re It_](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/05/i-see-that-youve-seen-that-i-saw-you-miscommunication-in-second-sons-game-of-thrones)” posts, which is ironic considering that the director of “Second Sons,” Michelle MacClaren, also directed the episode of _Breaking Bad_ featuring [this childhood standby](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/lazertag.jpg). From here continue to:
*   The second of the so-called “_[Game of LASER TAG: ‘Then you’ll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/05/i-still-know-that-youve-seen-that-i-saw-you-miscommunication-in-second-sons-game-of-thrones),’_” concerns the gratifying results created by the tapestry of eyelines MacClaren established early in the episode.
*   Then we moved on to  [“The Rains of Castamere” podcast](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/06/the-rains-of-castamere-an-lgm-game-of-thrones-podcast-with-steven-attewell-and-sek), in which Steven and I disagreed about when the titular song begins.
*   Then, in [my first post on the subject](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/06/its-always-been-raining-in-castamere),
 I noted that the eyelines — lasers or no lasers — align in a mannerthat should (and does) cause suspicion among the guests, foremost amongthem Catelyn Stark. I _almost_ discuss when the song begins, but then I don’t.
*   I covered that in my final post on [“The Rains of Castamere,”](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/06/awful-greek-words-that-apply-to-the-rains-of-castamere)
 in which I defined all the minor elements of Aristotelian tragedybefore demonstrating the order and manner in which they cause themaximum amount of pain and keening.

I hope this is less confusing. I know when material’s cross-linked 
and back-dated and newer posts appear before older ones that I sometimes
 find myself befuddled. There’s no shame in that. Or if there is, take 
heart in knowing I share it.
