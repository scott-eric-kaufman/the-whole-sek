## ATTENTION: New Internet Tradition

After spraining my entire back yesterday, I woke up in a mood this 
morning. So when I was assaulted on Facebook by a series of positive 
messages about how I should be optimistic about everything, and because 
I’m an asshole, I wrote:

Just so you know, every time you post one of those 
“inspirational” or “optimistic” quotations on Facebook, in my head I 
append “So jump off that building, you’re the goddamn Batman” to the end
 of it.

But this should totally be a thing. Like so:

[![GODDAMAN BATMAN2](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/GODDAMAN-BATMAN2.jpg "GODDAMAN BATMAN2")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/GODDAMAN-BATMAN2.jpg)

If you don’t know how to edit things on the Internet, well, all the 
better. The people who double-rainbow-with-wolf-and-moon these things 
don’t either. What have you got?

**UPDATE:** So:

I assume the switch from "you're" to "your" is intentional. . .
