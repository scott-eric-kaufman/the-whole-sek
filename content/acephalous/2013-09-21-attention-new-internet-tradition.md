After spraining my entire back yesterday, I woke up in a mood this morning. So when I was assaulted on Facebook by a series of positive messages about how I should be optimistic about everything, and because I’m an asshole, I wrote:

Just so you know, every time you post one of those “inspirational” or “optimistic” quotations on Facebook, in my head I append “So jump off that building, you’re the goddamn Batman” to the end of it.

But this should totally be a thing. Like so:

If you don’t know how to edit things on the Internet, well, all the better. The people who double-rainbow-with-wolf-and-moon these things don’t either. What have you got?

**UPDATE:** So:

So [thank you laura](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/09/attention-new-internet-tradition/comment-page-1#comment-691302):

I assume the switch from "you're" to "your" is intentional. . .
