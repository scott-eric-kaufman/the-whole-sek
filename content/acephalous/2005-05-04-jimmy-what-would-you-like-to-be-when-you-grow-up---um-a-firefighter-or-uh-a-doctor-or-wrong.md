## "Jimmy, What Would You Like to be When You Grow Up?"  "Um, a Firefighter or, uh, a Doctor or Wrong."

Some people are wrong on occasion.  Others are wrong on a regular basis.  Then there are the [professionally wrong](http://mthollywood.blogspot.com/2005\_05\_01\_mthollywood\_archive.html#111522219552038105).  Unless I _am_ a comfortably tenured professor of journalism, in which case someone ought to inform those hoople-headed cocksuckers in Payroll that if this situation remains unrectified I will fuck them flatter than hammered shit. 

**EDIT:** It looks like I'm back on the [war-path](http://mthollywood.blogspot.com/2005\_05\_01\_mthollywood\_archive.html#111530915093647870).  I'd hop on another, but I'm so angry and humorless.  Look closely.  See?  This is my Rage Face.  I'm also so disappointed in my inability to send more than twelve readers to the Bruce's fine site that I'm apt to stop blogging any day now.  Why?  I'm not sure, but it really pisses me off.

Yep, John Bruce is a moron.  When he can't argue with you, he descends to playground humor.  "You, Mr. Brainless, are a poo poo head!  Poo poo head, poo poo head, Acephalus is a poo poo head!"

The single best line from his multi paragraph screed?  The charge against Valvistas: "angry, prolix, humorless, ad hominem."  

Nice to meet you, Mr. Pot.

Actually, he's reached a new, paranoid low with a recent comment, which I cut and paste below:

Steve, I think John H., on reflection, decided the matter is best allowed to drop. He's getting foundation money to run The Valve, and considering how unpredictable the Blogosphere can be (as opposed to how predictably you can cow students in a seminar), I think it began to dawn on him that the wrong sort of controversy here -- and perhaps eventually elsewhere -- could pee in his lemonade, as it were. Nor would it help his career prospects if he made a name for himself in some blog controversy as a philosopher whose thought processes were out of kilter, so to speak. I suspect we'll hear nothing more of this, unless his colleagues want to take it further, which would be unwise indeed.
