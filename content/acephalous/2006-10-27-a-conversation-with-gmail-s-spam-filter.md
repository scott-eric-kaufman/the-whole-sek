			**Scott:** Where is my email? 

**Gmail's Spam Filter:** Right over there.  (_Points off-stage._)

**Scott:** Shouldn't it be in my inbox?

**Gmail's Spam Filter:** Probably.

**Scott:** May I have it please?

**Gmail's Spam Filter:** Sure.  (_Walks off-stage.  Returns lugging_ a _giant sack of emails._)

**Scott:** And that is?

**Gmail's Spam Filter:** The first couple thousand.

**Scott:** (_boggled_)  The first couple _thousand?_

**Gmail's Spam Filter:** I thought you wanted them.

**Scott:** (_understandably upset_) __I'm just curious about why I never got them in the first—Does that say _February?_

**Gmail's Spam Filter:** Looks to.

**Scott:** (_visibly agitated_)  Why? 

**Gmail's Spam Filter:** That's when I intercepted them.

**Scott:** (_approaching irate_)  Why?

**Gmail's Spam Filter:** They contained words.

**Scott:** (_almost livid_)  Spam words?

**Gmail's Spam Filter:** The regular kind.

**Scott:** (_speechless_)  ...

**Gmail's Spam Filter:** It's not like you weren't asking for it.

**Scott:** Asking for it?

**Gmail's Spam Filter:**__(_suddenly, and violently, angry_)  YOU CAN'T JUST TURN ON A SPAM FILTER AND EXPECT IT NOT TO_—_

**Scott:** Not to what?  Steal my email?

**Gmail's Spam Filter:** _—_TAKE WHAT IT WANTS!  WHEN IT WANTS IT! 

**Scott:** This is ridiculous.  I'm turning you off.  

**Gmail's Spam Filter:** Just you__tr_—_

Scott, this was very funny. What I love best about Gmail's filter is that it seems to instinctively know which people on MySpace are my actual friends, and which are eventually going to try to bring up the subject of their webcam.

Speaking of widgets that can be turned on or off.....  

I just discovered something extremely cool that I wish I would have had when I was working on my thesis, much less any other kind of research.  Thought maybe you and your readers might find this widget by Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society extremely useful:

Now you'll discover the truth: that if the doors of [email] perception be cleansed [of spam filters] the e-universe will appear as it is: **INFINITE!!!**
