Sure, I forgot to celebrate [your seventh birthday](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/happy-birthday-acephalous-.html), but baby, I still love you. We've been through [a lot](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/unbelievable-th.html), and [things have changed](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/11/scott-eric-kaufmans-visual-rhetoric-compendium-as-of-11282011.html), I admit, but don't worry, baby, I've got this covered. It's just you and me, babe. You ... and the very, very creepy version of me who's writing this post.Â

Second person is better than referring to yourself in the third person, says Gary Farber.  Gary Farber has long felt this way.
