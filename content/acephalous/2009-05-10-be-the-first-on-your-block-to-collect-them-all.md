And that concludes my "Best of" series for another year. I tend to think that self-selected lists work better than random category clouds.  (I don't myself, nor do I know of anyone, who rigorously tags all posts all the time according to the same criteria, though Lord knows we try.)  Over the next few weeks I'm going to continue cleaning up those lists (the first three all look hideous) as well as the posts linked in them, so if you want to see what real-time behind-the-scenes editing looks like, you know where to go.  (And if that's your bag, I'll be repainting the apartment any week now and can set up a webcam for you.)

To address [Adam's comment](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/05/the-best-of-acephalous-2008.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f843b54970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f843b54970c), I did link the funny posts in "DISSERTATION ACCOMPLISHED" in what I consider to be the descending order of their humorousness.  (Talking about funny things in such mangled clauses should be illegal.)  But one of the great things about blogging is that people can tell you when your self-evaluations are off-base.  I think it's great that Adam thinks that [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/02/yo-dawg-we-is-u.html) is funnier [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/01/why-obama-lost.html) or [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/01/time-to-mock-el.html), because that means that someone I've never met before has a strong opinion about my writing . . . which, when you think about it, is all sorts of awesome.

(And now it looks like the blog's won Connect Four twice over.  Time for me to stop while I'm ahead.)

"...someone I've never met before..."

Sorry: who are you, again?

Player?  I've always thought of you as a [gentleman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentlemen\_v\_Players) rather than a player, Scott.
