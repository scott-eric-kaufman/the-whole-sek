Turns out one of Goldstein's brood [took exception](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=23020) to [my previous post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/11/one-day-i-hope-to-stop-being-surprised.html) and attempted to refute it by making a series of patently idiotic claims.  For example:

> But Scott could at least have had the sense to not admit profound  ignorance on what Beck ever says. I’m not surprised, though, because I  know that for Serious People like SEK, admitting that he pays attention  to the likes of Glenn Beck would collapse any credibility he may have  among those whose good graces he desires to be in.

Your eyes don't deceive you: the argument is, in fact, that _criticizing_ Glenn Beck would "collapse any credibility [I] may have among those whose good graces [I] desire to be in."  Because we all know left-leaning academics who criticize far-right lunatics are shunned by their colleagues.  Further depressing my credibility is my intellectual honesty, which here takes the form of my admission, up front, that I'm not a regular viewer of the show.  Note, though, that the claim is that I admitted a "profound ignorance on what Beck ever says," which is strange because I did no such thing.  I wrote:

> I try not to pay attention to Glenn Beck, but even when I have, I never really _paid attention_ to him.

That's "passing familiarity," not "profound ignorance," and the difference between the two should be obvious, and is, unless your refutation of my post continues thus:

You see, all of the topics that Glenn addresses–the dots that Scott  attempts to connect–are topics that Glenn has has talked about at length  in the past, so when he mentions this or that, he’s harking back to  discussions he’s already had, discussions that most of the people  watching have already heard.

Translation: "All the dots Scott connected have been connected in the past, and this refutes his argument somehow."  How exactly?  Like so:

> See, what Glenn has said in the past about the Chinese is that unlike  us, they plan waaaaay far ahead. They have contingency plans and stuff.  And they’re looking to achieve hegemony in Asia and maybe more. Glenn  has NEVER said that the Chinese plan to invade the U.S.

So his fear-mongering concerning the Chinese is related to their desire to "achieve hegemony in Asia and maybe more."  That's some non-ominous "maybe more" there, and the fact that it didn't issue from his mouth only makes my point stronger: he's inculcated his Fear of a Yellow Planet in his audience so successfully that _even when they attempt to claim that his fears are fact-based and rational_ the fruits of his irrational speculation appear.  To wit:

> Glenn has expressed this fear for a long time. He posits that a lot of  powerful radicals, financed by Soros cash, are counting on Obama to  fulfill their political wish list, but that if he proves to be unable or  unwilling to do so, they’ll take him out.

Claiming that he's "posit[ed]" something sans evidence for "a long time" doesn't disprove my argument that he engages in irresponsible apocalyptic speculation, it merely extends its provenance.  Put differently: "Glenn Beck can't be saying crazy things now because he's said these same crazy things before" is a laughably weak defense _because it admits the very thing it wants to deny_. The rest of the "refutation" works according to similarly unsound logic.  For example, mind-reading:

> Scott has never heard Glenn talk about “Dreams from My Father,”  wherein he shows how Obama’s father dreamed of establishing a Marxist  government in Kenya, among other far-left goals, and how Obama  identifies with those dreams and seeks to carry on his father’s project.

I haven't?  Doesn't matter.  Why doesn't it matter?  Because Marxism isn't heritable and people who think otherwise think crazy-thoughts.

> Nor did Scott see Glenn’s three-part series on George Soros:

I didn't?  It doesn't matter.  Why doesn't it matter?  Because if you follow those links all you'll find is more madness couched in bed-wetting rhetoric.  For example, Soros

> has focused his attention. This isn't a hypothesis. This has  been proven. This is what this man does. He has done it before and now,  he wants orderly decline of the dollar—his words, not mine.  If you thought $5 or $4 a gallon gas is painful, wait until  Soros devalues your dollar even more. Forget driving. How about eating?

How is that _not_ fear-mongering?  Because if claiming that food will be too expensive to eat for everyone except millionaires and Washington power-brokers isn't __ fear-mongering, then I don't know what is.  The response will be that it's _informed_ fear-mongering, which would be a valid defense except for the fact that it isn't informed.  For example:

> And also why he cites the very similar dreams of Jay Rockefeller’s left-wing father.

David Rockefeller [isn't Jay's Rockefeller's father](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rockefeller), thereby undermining the "logic" of basing a conspiracy on the title of Obama's autobiography.  That said "logic" was there to be undermined in the first place points to the vapidity of Beck's associative argument style.  It _looks_ like an argument even if it isn't informed like one:

> Glenn peddles in THE UNKNOWN?
> 
> Are you HIGH?
> 
> What the hell do you think all that blackboard scrawling was about?

This is a perfect example of what I implied in the previous post: Beck's convinced his audience that lines on a chalkboard have the force of logic.  Those lines only indicate a nebulous (if even that) connection between the figures dotted on either end of them, but because they are _LINES_ and there are _DOLLAR SIGNS_ near them, his audience is convinced they must be meaningful.  That one of those dots is [invariably ACORN](http://s3.mediamatters.org/static/video/2009/09/21/beck-20090921-consp.jpg) escapes notice because he's convinced his audience that the reach of The Most Powerful Man In The World extends down to small-potato community organization groups _and_ that believing that isn't a sign of conspiratorial thinking. 

Except that it is.  When such thinking is latched to devoting entire shows to canning your own food, you've got apocalyptic rhetoric in full-effect.  That's why this is ridiculous:

> Scott also doesn’t know that Glenn frequently telegraphs what he’ll be  doing in future shows, and so his stopping short was not to frighten us through omission but to _save that stuff for later_.

I know what a "tease" is, and in the original post, I was noting the particular synergy at work with this one:

> People fear what they don’t know,  especially when they’re being told,  in ominous tones, that the unknown  requires preparation and is  connected, somehow, to the “shadowy” or  “spooky” forces of the One  World Government.

Everything after the word "especially" is, it goes without saying, especially important.  Then again, every word in this post should go without saying, and yet ...

This was very helpful: I forsee a conversation much like this in my in-law-laden near future!

You, sir, are brave.  My friend watches Beck fairly regularly, not because he agrees, but because he wants to understand Beck's rhetoric.  Since I run a blog, we've discussed possibly writing about Beck.  But I don't see a point.  You've pretty much done all that needs doing here.  Bravo.
