Bet you never saw that one coming -- but I have proof!


Not only did I not come out on top, I didn't even inform the audience who I was. The panel was running late and I was so eager to get it started for the audience that I just whizzed through my introduction -- including the part where I told them my name and theirs -- so I'm sure I offended them, and I hate that. I only hope the thoughtful, respectful nature of my questions made up for the initial awkward/awfulness.

But in all seriousness, I doubt that I'll ever interview three people with the global standing and reach of these three men. Point being, this is the blog's greatest moment -- "peak Acephalous" if you will -- so we ought to cherish it.

Or something, I'm not sure, even watching it again, I'm a bundle of nerves.
