## Busted!

[_The following post was written for mature audiences.  Reader discretion is advised._]

The Donalde [caught me cursing](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2011/05/scott-eric-kaufman-awards-students-who.html), which as we all know I never do.  Well, actually, the Donalde caught my student cursing, which as we all know they never do either.  Then he proved I've cursed before by linking to [an unformatted comment](http://uncommon-priors.com/?p=1875#comment-5188) in a post that deemed me "insufferable" for writing those visual rhetoric posts you love—or at least the ones that receive the most random positive feedback.  Because he's the Donalde, he fails to realize that I was being purposely insufferable because I'd been called "insufferable," and that I sarcastically answered the question ["What the fucking fuck?" with "Q.F.E.F.D."](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/03/10/watching-watchmen-how-unfilmable-novels-become-unwatchable-films/#comment-35743)  But alas!  It is not in the Donalde to recognize such things.

However, it _is_ in the Donalde to end a post in which he castigates me for cursing by calling me an "asshat."  He does as well with irony as he does sarcasm and Google: he suggests that I use the word "cocksucker" in private, when I not only use it quite publicly, [I think it can be fucking poetry](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/08/deadwood\_and\_to.html).

I love how Douglas bobbles the Biblical "beam" bash, spiralling spontaneously into self-parody.

Against my better judgement I clicked through on one of your spats with right-wing nobodies.  There was one redeeming item on this one.  He keyworded his post "Academe, Blogging, Communists" (and Moral Bankruptcy and Radical Left).  Communists?  Maybe he was just carried away by the A, B, C's.  Well, really, we all know that he has the wingnut derangement in which anyone to the left of them is a Communist.  But since that really makes no sense at all, now I'm trying to imagine an alternate universe where only Communists say Fuck.  Every F-bomb indicates loyalty to the precepts of Marxism-Leninism.  (Maoists pronounce it the same way, but insist that the proper way of writing it in English is Xuck.)  Every R-rated movie just got a bit more amusing, I think.

First, this isn't a spat, because I'm not really doing anything more than point and laugh.  Second, given that I link to that _Deadwood_ post above, I'm thinking your theory about "fuck" and far left fealty means that show wasn't about frontier American capitalism so much as an allegory of infighting in the American left during the '20s and '30s.  Communism's a given, it's all about whether you're a Stalinist-Leninist or a Marxist-Leninist-Trotskyite, or etc. etc. etc.

Dude, you're not just busted, you're flat-out fucked... ...and don't you forget it, \*ssh\*t. 

(I'm sorry... I don't use the words "ass" or "hat" in public... It's a purity thing... I want to remain a verbal virgin until... well, until I fucking well feel like popping my verbal virginity cherry with a blogger who'll respect me afterward, I guess, just like my verbal virginity sponsor, Donalde Dougl\*ss. And while he apparently won't fuck you, he did want me to tell you you're a douchebag. A f\*cking douchebag, in fact. And now I have.)

Wow. Donalde is copying me by calling YOU an "asshat"?

I should have been more creative, SEK. My apologies. Had I know my little fanboi would resort to monkeying, I would have called him a monkeyfister or a rump-fed runyon.

Remember in ST:TOG when Kirk makes Nomad nuts by inserting some impeccably implausible logic into him about perfection created by imperfect beings?

So I'm thinking (and I'm not suggesting we actually do this, this is a thought experiment in psychosis): What if we called Mrs Douglas a cocksucker?

CJ,

I like that thought.

"Fucking workers of the fucking world fucking unite! You are the fucking means of production, fucking fuckers!"
