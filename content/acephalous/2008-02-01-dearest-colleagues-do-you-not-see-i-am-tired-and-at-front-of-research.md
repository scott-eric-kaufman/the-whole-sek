(_Being the fourth in what I did not expect to have become a series on listserv etiquette and violations thereof: [Part I](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/09/what-they-see-w.html), [Part II](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/09/more-on-listser.html), and [Part III](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/more-listserv-e.html)._)
Dearest Colleagues,

Today on the Internet I found a [very reputable site](http://www.angelfire.lycos.com/) indicating that a medical procedure impossible to perform prior to the discovery of antibiotics in 1928 may have been widespread in Victorian England.  I was wondering if members of the list could point me to scholarly books, articles, dissertations, abstracts, indexes, bibliographies, errata sheets or, alternatively, contemporary newspaper clippings, fictional accounts, poems, songs, tragedies, diaries, daydreams, larks or fancies in which this procedure plays a vital part?  In my forthcoming manuscript, I demonstrate gross ignorance of basic medical fact and speculate that Victorians could have performed this procedure, so any mention of it will confirm to my satisfaction the validity of my speculation.  (Or, if not confirm, it will prove the procedure haunted the Victorian imagination by means of its terrifying potential, which for scholars of my caliber amounts to the same thing.)

I would be particularly interested in accounts demonstrating the procedure not only done to beast _and_ man, but _from_ beast _to_ man.

Warmest Regards,

Dr. [Elderly Jew Deserving of Scorn](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/01/time-to-mock-el.html)

What listservs do you belong to, anyway?  They sound as though they offer countless seconds of mild amusement.

_I demonstrate gross ignorance of basic medical fact..._

Indeed, this is central to my point.

He clasps the crag with crooked hands;  

Close to the sun in lonely lands,  

Ringed with the azure world, he stands.

The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;  

He watches from his mountain walls,  

And like a thunderbolt he performs a heart transplant.
