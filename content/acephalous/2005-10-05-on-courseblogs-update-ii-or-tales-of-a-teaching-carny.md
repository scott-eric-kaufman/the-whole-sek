Quickly: I hereby tag thee _[Teaching-Carnival](http://technorati.com/tag/teaching-carnival)._ On to the actual post:

For the second time this week, I fulfill [a promise](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/teaching\_carnival\_ii/#4420) to post about a given topic; namely, [my courseblog](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj20/).  (Regular readers know what I'm talking about.  Those drawn here by the carnival can read my initial musings [here](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/on\_coursebloggi.html).)  I've been meaning to talk about how this experiment proceeds, but life has intruded.  Now that I'm living it at its proper remove again, I have time enough to say that courseblogging works.  I'll discuss the benefits first, then share a few reservations.

_Class prepartation_

My old class preparation routine consisted of re-reading the essay
I'd be teaching the next day and considering its place in the course. 
If I'd taught an article before, I'd look over my old notes to
determine whether they're still germane.  If they were, I reaquainted
myself with them; if they weren't, I worked up new notes.  

Now I sit down, open my laptop, look over my notes and determine
what aspect of the essay could benefit from careful dissection.  For
example, before teaching John McPhee's "Atchafalaya" on Monday, I spent
Sunday morning piquing the students interest in [his characteristically revealing metaphors](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj20/2005/10/the\_john\_mcphee.html). 
I did this despite knowing that I would spend the majority of Monday's
class discussing his research methodology and structuring techniques. 
One blog post allowed me to accomplish two days worth of teaching in a
single class period.  It also relieved the pressure we all feel to
cover _everything_ in a single period.  Of course, in addition to
supplementing the assigned reading with extended discussion, I can also
supplement the course itself with readings I didn't assign but think
the students ought to read.  In addition to the extensive list of
resources scrolling down my sidebar, I've also posted [emails from Pulitzer Prize-winning on the subject of foreshadowing](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj20/2005/09/franklin\_on\_for.html) and exceptional works of literary journalism published that week, like an excerpt from Joan Didion's [latest book](http://acephalous.typepad.com/didion.htm) or [her 2002 profile of Martha Stewart](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/content/?040322fr\_archive01).  (Lest you think the students don't read the supplementary material, here's [a comment](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj20/2005/09/true\_detective.html#comment-9844963) in which a student incorporates it into her argument.)

_The Actual Class_

Because I had analyzed McPhee's metaphors in a post they had already
mulled over, I was able to discuss them with a much higher degree of
sophistication.  The responses from the students were correspondingly
higher.  Because we will be talking in more detail about literary
journalists' special relationship with metaphorical writing, I didn't
need to (nor did I) discuss McPhee's at great length.  However, in
today's class the students brought up Susan Orlean's metaphors in
"Lifelike" and compared them to McPhee's in "Atchafalaya."  That means
when I address the subject formerly in Week 5, the students will
already have been processing the subject in a sophisticated manner for
four weeks.  The corresponding benefit is that when we have the formal
discussion in Week 5, it will be far more informed by the reading
they've already done than past classes have.  Why?

Because they've been processing the information _in a structured manner_ for
four weeks.  The "structured" bit's important, because unlike casual
references to future topics of discussion during class, the blog post
makes a particular point which--in conjunction with other discussions
we'll have the next few weeks--trains the students to address the
problem in a very particular way.  In other words, these supplemental
blog posts both alleviate the guilt of insufficient coverage, they also
accelerate the speed with which students acquire new concepts.  

_The Students' Reactions_

The courseblog also accomplishes something amazing: it keeps the course in the students' minds _after they leave the class_. 
I always do a post-class wrap-up in my head after class as I walk home
or to my office: "What did I do well?  Poorly?  What did I forget to
mention?  Did I exaggerate the importance of this or that?  Did I cut
this student off?  Why didn't I call on that one more often?"  I think
about my performance for an hour or so after each class.  Then I take
down notes about what I don't feel I covered adequately, what I
could've communicated better, &c.  I replay the class discussion
and often find that I've said embarrassing things; some times on
account of incorrectly understanding what a student said, others
because I'm a blockhead or was trying not to derail my train of thought
in order to make a particular point.  Now [I can correct those mistakes almost instantly](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj20/2005/09/the\_story\_natur\_1.html). 
Again, I save valuable class time but I also recall the student's
attention the class discussion when they're not in class; furthermore,
they can continue the conversation, with me, outside of class in a
non-invasive or time-consuming fashion.  

For example, [two](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj20/2005/09/for\_friday\_9300.html#comment-9925224) [students](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj20/2005/09/for\_friday\_9300.html#comment-9932311) continued Friday's discussion; [three](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj20/2005/10/the\_bizarre\_is\_.html#comment-10017356) [more](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj20/2005/10/the\_bizarre\_is\_.html#comment-9993351) [students](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj20/2005/10/the\_bizarre\_is\_.html#comment-9990251)
continued today's.  The quality of the comments varies (both from
student-to-student and from the standards a given student sets with
earlier comments), but the quality matters less than the reinforcement
sometimes.  (Students of mine reading this: I _did not_ say the
"quality doesn't matter."  I said "Quality notwithstanding, there are
additional benefits to the process of commenting.")

More enheartening still is the sentence I now hear emanating from
the mouths of my students on a daily basis: "As I wrote."  Three simple
words, I know, but they're slowly acquiring a relationship to their
writing akin to the one we have.  No longer a representation of their
thoughts, their writing is now an extension of them.  They think about
what we discuss both in terms of what they think right then-and-there
in the present moment and what they thought earlier.  _They're becoming little hermeneuts._ They
say things like, "I know I wrote that X works like Y, but now that
we're discussing Z, I don't think that's the case."  Then they sit
back, think about X in terms of Y and Z, and a couple hours later
they'll write [a response](http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj20/2005/10/the\_bizarre\_is\_.html#comment-10005265). 
They may not have been thinking about it consistently during the
intervening, but they thought about it enough to feel compelled to
write about it when they returned home.

If you clicked on the previous link, you'll notice that that student refers to another student in the class _by name_. 
Not only does she know her classmate's name, but she's associated her
classmate's position with it.  This reflects the fact that getting this
class to talk isn't like pulling teeth.  They've become comfortable
speaking in front of each other more quickly than any I've taught
before.  This is partly because they've gotten to know each other
through their writing earlier than normal, but it's partly because they
all feel ownership of this thing we call in class "our courseblog."  "I
wrote a note about it on our blog," a student will say.  This blog
belongs to them as much as me; they know they're free to post on it
whenever they please, and so far no one's written anything
inappropriate.  (That may be more of an issue in a class larger than
mine.  I currently have 17 students enrolled, so no one's anonymous.) 

_Some Reservations_

One of my weaknesses as a teacher is that I talk far too much.  When
they should be discussing something, teasing some point from some text,
I'm usually running my mouth.  I try very hard not to dominate the
classroom, but I often fail.  Similarly, I have to resist the urge to
clog the blog with repsonses to student comments and student's
repsonses to my responses to their initial comments.  I want them to
feel free to think aloud, as it were, without fear that I'll come in,
stamp my foot and mouth the definitive word on whatever it is they're
thinking through.  (Sometimes they want me to respond, but sometimes I
don't even respond then, instead saving my response for the next
session.)  Of course I read all their comments, and I think they know
this, but I could see two things happening that might discourage them
from participating fully:

1.  I respond to everything, at length, and overwhelm the blog the way I often overwhelm the classroom.
2.  I don't respond to everything and offend students who can't fathom why I respond to some comments but not others. 

To my knowledge, neither situation has arisen yet.  But I can
foresee one or the other happening at least once before the end of the
quarter.

Note: I reserve the right to update this post at great length.
