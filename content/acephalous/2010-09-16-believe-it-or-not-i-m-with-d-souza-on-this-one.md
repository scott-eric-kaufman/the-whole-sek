## Believe it or not, I’m with D’Souza on this one.

I have nothing to say about Dinesh D’Souza’s [highly praised](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/246302/gingrich-obama-s-kenyan-anti-colonial-worldview-robert-costa) [article](http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0927/politics-socialism-capitalism-private-enterprises-obama-business-problem\_print.html) in _Forbes_ because it’s predicated on the claim that

Colonialism today is a dead issue. No one cares about it except the man in the White House. He is the last anticolonial.

If you make the above claims after debating the relative merits of  the “neocolonial” and “anticolonial” positions, you need to re-read your  own article to see that the only thing “dead” about colonialism is your  capacity to understand that it is logically implicit and historically  complicit in its own legacy. Go figure. But as long as I’m on the  subject of being stupendously wrong, I should note that the previous is  not the central objection to D’Souza’s argument [at the _American Thinker_](http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/09/what\_dsouza\_doesnt\_get\_quite\_r.html):

As much as I admire D’Souza, however, I must take issue  with his argument. Yes, Obama does seem to espouse a certain inchoate  anticolonialism, but the “dreams” do not come so much from his father as  from his mother, and they have been given voice by Obama’s muse,  terrorist emeritus Bill Ayers.

What Cashill has done to that poor horse is [wrong](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/10/who-really-wrot.html), [wrong](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/06/polygraphlevel-scholarship-may-suffice-for-harmless-speculation-about-the-authorship-of-midsummers-n.html), [wrong](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/08/jack-cashill-barack-obama-plagiarism-william-ayers-new-york-times-kakutani.html), [wrong](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/turns-out-i-owe-jack-cashill-an-apology.html),  but not entirely unexpected.  He’s banked his career on the possibility  that his claims are true and has no choice now but to continue to  compile “evidence” to support them, such as:

D’Souza cites “Frantz Fanon” as one of “Obama’s acknowledged intellectual influences.” What he overlooks is that in _Fugitive Days_, Ayers misspells Fanon’s first name as “Franz,” exactly as Obama does in _Dreams_.  Also on the anticolonial front, both Ayers and Obama misspell in the  same fashion the site of the South African massacre, Sharpeville.

Wait a minute!  I remember addressing [this argument](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/06/polygraphlevel-scholarship-may-suffice-for-harmless-speculation-about-the-authorship-of-midsummers-n.html) when it concerned prepositions:

[B]oth Ayers and Obama misquote the opening line of Carl Sandburg’s “Chicago,” substituting “hog butcher _to_ the world” for “hog butcher _for_ the world.” This mutual error would be significant (an “A-level match”)  if Ayers and Obama were the only two people who ever made it, but  according to Google Book Search—a secret search engine to which only I  have access—the same mistake has been made by [Nelson Algren](http://books.google.com/books?id=4xbgml7gD1kC&pg=PA251&dq=), [Alan Lomax](http://books.google.com/books?id=pm04AAAAIAAJ&q=), [Andrei Codrescu](http://books.google.com/books?id=FvYF9QxKH-UC&pg=PP1&dq=), [H.L. Mencken](http://books.google.com/books?id=jEgEAAAAYAAJ&q=), [Paul Krugman](http://books.google.com/books?id=17YrneuxiTgC&pg=PP1&dq=), [Perry Miller](http://books.google.com/books?id=j0F1AAAAMAAJ&q=), [Donald Hall](http://books.google.com/books?id=okNbAAAAMAAJ&q=), [Ed McBain](http://books.google.com/books?id=-ZOwAAAAIAAJ&q=), [Saul Bellow](http://books.google.com/books?id=HoAwAAAAMAAJ&q=), [S.J. Perelman](http://books.google.com/books?id=AkZbAAAAMAAJ&q=), [Nathanaël West](http://books.google.com/books?id=qHFcAAAAMAAJ&q=), [Ezra Pound](http://books.google.com/books?id=Wi1bAAAAMAAJ&q=), [Wright Morris](http://books.google.com/books?id=5JHbAAAAIAAJ&q=), [Allen Ginsberg](http://books.google.com/books?id=qlGQbMH\_BcIC&pg=PA63&dq=), [Langston Hughes](http://books.google.com/books?id=9JPL7qNp20wC&pg=PA327&dq=), and the [1967 Illinois Commission on Automation and Technological Progress](http://books.google.com/books?id=eSsaAAAAIAAJ&q=). (To name [but a few](http://books.google.com/books?q=%!h(MISSING)og+butcher+to+the+world%!)(MISSING).) According to Cashill, I have now proven that _Dreams From My Father_ was written by many a dead man of American letters, a [living](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/06/polygraphlevel-scholarship-may-suffice-for-harmless-speculation-about-the-authorship-of-midsummers-n.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef01157181b597970b#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01157181b597970b) mystery writer, a _New York Times_ columnist and the 1967 Illinois Commission on Automation and Technological Progress.

That said, since unique misspellings represent an entirely new line  of argument for Cashill, I should give him the benefit of the doubt and  fact-check this too.  Let’s see:

Google results for “Franz Fanon”: **[~70,000](http://www.google.com/search?q=)**  
 Google results for “Frantz Fanon”: **[~416,000](http://www.google.com/search?q=)**

Google results for “Sharpville”: **[~94,200](http://www.google.com/search?q=sharpville)**  
 Google results for “Sharpeville”: **[~510,000](http://www.google.com/search?q=sharpeville)**

For most people, the fact that the correct spellings vastly outnumber the incorrect ones wouldn’t constitute evidence that _only_ Ayers and Obama have ever misspelled those names that way, but Jack Cashill isn’t most people.  Like [the Donalde](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/09/is-donalde-douglas-real),  Cashill’s acquired the reputation of a man who will do anything to  acquire a reputation.  Admittedly, he hasn’t demonstrated the “tactical  elan” of an “unmatched competitor” by [closing down](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/tactical-elan-unmatched-competitor.html) [the comments](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/don-douglas-hearts-juses.html) on posts where he might be challenged to back up his fightin’ words with their arguin’ kin—but remember that the Donalde is [a special sort of stupid](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/07/shoot-im-not-even-always-right-lol), the likes of which we almost don’t deserve.

"a special sort of stupid" -- nice. On that front, ya never know, H.L. Mencken and Allen (not "Alan") Ginsberg (not "Ginsburg") could have been in cahoots. Yeah, never mind...
