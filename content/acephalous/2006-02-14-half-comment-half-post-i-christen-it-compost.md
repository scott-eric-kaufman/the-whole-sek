[_WARNING: The following post reads like a comment.  Just so you know.  'Cause I set high standards for posts around here.  I like them to be freestanding and am disappointed when they seem otherwise.  And so I have banished it below the fold . . . where it will frolic in fields of flowers with all your beloved dead pets._]

N. Pepperell of [Rough Theory](http://www.roughtheory.org/) [points](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/a\_post\_in\_two\_p.html#comment-13932202)
to her desire to engage in gender-neutral online debates as one of the
reasons she doesn't post under her full name.  I should begin by noting
that I hadn't realized she was a woman despite her having commented
here fairly frequently over the past few months . . . but neither did I
assume her a man.  Be gentle, dear readers, as I blunder through this
minefield: the operative question here is how I could have failed to
notice the import of gender entirely.  The answer?  If someone's name
fails to mark their gender it doesn't pique my curiosity.  I'm more
interested in what "entities" have to say than in communicating with
them as people.  Not that I don't acknowledge them as human beings,
mind you, because I do.  But online all the identitarian benchmarks can
fall to the wayside without damaging the intensity of intellectual
interaction.  Like Pepperell, I would prefer my words not be implicated
in the masculinist discourse I've taken pains to remove myself from
elsewhere.

And that's what trips up so much online communication.  Because I've done what I've done _elsewhere_ and _previously_ instead of always _here_ and _immediately_,
I leave myself open to charges that I'm ignoring what I've failed to
explicate here.  This is why I'm such a devoted bridge-builder.  WHAT? 
YOU?  A BRIDGE-BUILDER!  

Yes.  (Stop laughing.)

I am.  (I _really_ am.)

A bridge-builder.  (Don't make me turn this car around.)

Despite the fact that my posts on the Valve tend to generate [more comments](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/archive\_author/sekaufman/Scott%!E(MISSING)ric%!K(MISSING)aufman)
than any post which doesn't include the word "Zizek" in it, none of the
principle combatants considers me anti-intellectual or unnecessarily
hostile.  (I can provide definitive proof of this but am satisfied to
let the statement stand and have Matt, LB, CR, Ken Rufo, &c.
waiting in the wings in case anyone doubts me on this one.)  Despite
regularly ruffling everyone's feathers I have somehow maintained my
integrity and popularity.  The reason, I believe, is that I confront
arguments instead of people and proffer counter-arguments instead of
attacks.  I don't think this an inherently masculine or feminine so
much as an _acquired_ trait.  I've trained myself to respond in
such a way that the compact that is "the benefit of the doubt" is never
broken no matter how heated the debate becomes.  (Speaking of which:
I've been grading and grading and grading all day . . . and so may need
a heartier benefit of a greater doubt than is typical.)

Belle (if I may) [notes](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/a\_post\_in\_two\_p.html#comment-13940109)
that seriously blogging transforms fun into work.  I don't think that's
quite right.  The thing about studying literature for a living is that
when boiled to the bone it _is_ fun.  It doesn't _feel_ like
fun when committees breath down your back and you can't place your
article anywhere . . . but to say that generating interesting and
accurate readings of literature is a fate worse than death would be the
baldest of lies.  I'm of the school of future English professors who
believes that we enjoy what we do whenever we don't have to do it. 
Most of us are "literary intellectuals" who would read much of what we
read anyway.  We're [Ray](http://www.pseudopodium.org/)
with the possibility of tenure.  We sometimes forget we love to do what
we do because the gallons swirling around us threaten both to crush and
drown . . . but as soon as we can catch a breath I think we know that
the reason blogging about what we work on brings us pleasure—the reason
why, at the end of the day, I can write something about contemporary
American literature and the canonization of literary theory—is the
simple fact that we love what we do.

(Only not so much right now what with this dissertation hanging over
my head.)  In other words: I write this here blog and contribute to the
Valve not because it feels like work but because, as reluctant as I am
to be "creative" nightly, the benefits of doing so _far_ outweigh the burdens.  Blogging, after all, reminds me of _why I wanted to study literature in the first place_.  My dissertation, well, it reminds me of my dissertation.  (And I _don't_ want to be reminded of that.)

As [Jon](http://www.posthegemony.org/) [says](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/a\_post\_in\_two\_p.html#comment-13940189):
"I often, for instance, write beyond my nominal disciplinary expertise.
And I try at least to write in a format that is relatively accessible,
if only perhaps to those who have a prior interest in the concepts I'm
discussing."  Blogging takes us outside of ourselves and force us to
address a general audience we otherwise wouldn't.  That feeling of
freedom to explore fields outside one's expertise and that mode of
engagement which addresses a generally intelligent audience is
something that the average academic rarely experiences . . . and yet
through the power of blog a whole host of people can experience it
together.  The more I think about it, the more I agree with those who
think my categories too strict.  I think intent and implied audience
the more powerful attractor of academics to blogging than I initially
had. 

And with this I draw this overlong comment-post to a close.  I _still_ haven't
addressed the "medieval blogging phenonemon" yet.  (I do so in passing
to justify the trackback.)  But I believe ending on this note
appropriate because—to sully the stable categories I had established
earlier—I will be spending Valentine's Day with The Little
Womedievalist . . .  
. . . who is currently at UCLA attending the Derek Pearsall lecture on "[Piers Plowman and His Afterlife.](http://www.calendar.ucla.edu/event\_detail.cfm?MeetingID=103536)"  See what I mean about you medievalists and your 'Zoo bonds?  They're wicked strong.

For the record, not that you implied this--it's not that I don't enjoy my work--I do. I find it genuinely interesting, and I'm really passionate about it (much to the bewilderment of those who don't like to study the Commerce Clause).  That said, I wonder if any lawyer, political scientist, legal academic would consider their reading/writing "fun." I used to study literature--yes, even if it wasn't assigned, I would have read it "for fun" anyway.  But I really, really wonder that if I wasn't a legal academic, I'd just pick up 19th century cases about shipping boats and wheat farmers and how they impact interstate commerce--for fun.  I don't mean to lampoon my profession, maybe there are freakshows out there who do read this for fun.

That said, don't you think there's a difference between smoe of the more fun and the more "work-related" texts you read?  Novels: fun.  Derrida, Lacan, Delueze:  Not as fun? It's not just a fiction/non-fiction distinction.In my field, general-interest, for the lay reader law books, academic texts from other disciplines: fun, the way history biographies by David McCulloch (sp?) are fun.  But law review articles, cases new and old:  these are "interesting," but not something you keep on the  nightstand. Right now, The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Luis Zafon is on my nightstand, and all the other law stuff is in this gigantic file box.  I wonder if you keep 

Keep on bridge-buildin'.  And keep on loving what you do. I do myself, I just don't think it's beach-reading material.

Hey, this category is not reserved for English Profs.  

It's called 'demand resistance.'
