## What's wrong with <em>Reading Comics</em>? Quite a bit, actually.

Because late [to the party](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/archive/C66/) is better than never, I’m reading Douglas Wolk’s [_Reading Comics_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0306816164/diesekoschmar-20).  When I’m not [maybe being mocked](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/did-douglas-wolk-just-call-me-a-girl.html), the book is a compelling read.  This is a problem.  Since [tradition dictates](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/comics\_and\_canonicity/) picking nits with blurbs, I’ll start with the quotation from the _Los Angeles Times_ printed on the cover:

Deliciously quotable.

Of all the _Times_ blurbs to pick with nits, this one may not even be the best.  From the back cover:

Everything is here.

If everything is there and there is deliciously quotable—but let me
begin with the second blurb, because it concerns a minor point.  No
matter how you define “everything,” _Reading Comics_ does not contain it all.  Wolk periodically informs the reader of this fact: 

There are . . . several very big names I’m barely
mentioning or neglecting outright in the following pages: Jack Kirby,
Robert Crumb . . . (137)

And we can ellipses away there because this is a book about comics that
barely mentions or outright neglects Jack Kirby and Robert Crumb.  Why
the _Times_
would make claims the author explicitly rejects I don’t know—but I
suspect its decision relates to the tone of casual expertise Wolk
displays throughout the book.  Every reference I catch—about half of
the ones Wolk drops—complements his argument; however, the way you wear
your erudition lightly on the web differs from how you do it in print. 
The book’s delicious quotability is a byproduct of its learned
chattiness, and if the medium is ever to attain academic
respectability, its expositors will need to try a little harder than
this:

[Steve Ditko] shared a studio for years with
bondage/fetish artist Eric Stanton and has claimed they didn’t
collaborate, but Ditko expert Blake Bell has a Web site on which he
points out some work credited to Stanton that’s clearly Ditko—those
hands are the giveaway. (157)

Not only does Wolk punt academic form, he punts online decorum too.  If
you mention that someone has a “Web site,” you provide the reader with
a way to find it.  A link to Blake Bell’s discussion of Ditko and
fetish comics in a printed book would be gravy, but at least provide
the name of the site ([_Ditko Looked Up_](http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/)) and the name of the article.  Speaking of which, the article is not on the “[Articles](http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/artist/articles.html)“ page, nor is it listed on the “[Creations](http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/crea/creation.html)."
It took me some time to track down the reference—according to its
address, it should have been on the “Creations” page—and once there I
realized why Wolk obscured the reference.  Behold [the first evidence](http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/crea/crerbbpg.html) Bell uses to establish that Ditko collaborated with Stanton:

The dead giveaway here is the man in both pages;
especially the bottom inset panel on Page 2. How Ditko is THAT guy?
Look at the fingers on his smoking hand! Did Stanton even TOUCH that
panel?

Now for the [second](http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/crea/crerkhpg.html):

That cop in the bottom three panels of Page 6 (on the
right) is so Ditko, it is scary. Look at the body contortions of the
woman in Panel 1 of the same page.

That’s vintage Spider-Man. This brings us back to the point—Ditko had far more to do with Stanton’s artwork than just inking.

I don’t doubt the authority of Bell’s eyes, but his mode of
argumentation is for crap.  Papering over his source the way Wolk does
will not win the medium any respect.  There are ways to talk about how
comics are drawn—line and technique, understanding of anatomy,
&c.—but Wolk declines to do so here.  His technical description of
Frank Miller’s work in the next chapter is more robust, but there too
he refuses to push too far into specifics.  If you aim to establish the
distinctiveness of a particular style, you need to borrow or build a
vocabulary with which can do so.  The claim that something “is so
something, it is scary” simply won’t cut it.  

I admit to having [a vested interested](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/what-can-blog-do-for-you.html) in building a reasonably critical working vocabulary, but even so, I’m not sure how useful _Reading Comics_
will be to the project.  Because, pace John, Wolk’s book can’t “the
best work of literary criticism [anyone reads] this year” because,
though the prose may shine and the erudition sparkle, it just isn’t
critical enough to be called criticism.

I think that READING COMICS can be thought of as being two books - one that lays out a framework and context for critical analysis and another that is just a collection of \*appreciations\* for works that Wolk likes. Aside from the license he gives himself in the "first book" to be selective in his choice of works for close readings, he doesn't seem terribly interested in actually using his own framework for criticism in the "second book", at least not in any kind of clear or purposeful way. The first book is fairly provocative, but the second is inconsistent, or at least limited in its appeal and usefulness depending on what you think of the artists and writers that Wolk chooses to write about. The idiosyncrasy of his choices would be less limiting if he used them to model the kind of analysis promised at the outset.

I have a similar view of but the reverse conclusions about the book than Shaun does, as I think most of the Valve people who read it did.  I thought the first half was derivative and not very useful.  In the first part, he has little potted bits of McCloud and others, not very well integrated, not really developing his sources.  So I wouldn't say that the first part is "provocative".  The second part, on the other hand, seems to me to be the part of the book that's useful; Wolk is a pretty good intuitive critic, and his pieces on individual works are better than his pieces on criticism.

Rich: I also find some of the individual chapters in the second part of the book to be good reads and insightful, but I agree with SEK in the original post that for a text attempting to articulate a way of doing comics criticism there are some notable omissions. Wolk seems more interested in drawing attention to, and writing about, his own favs than he does in developing a rigorous approach to "reading comics" (in his defense, he pretty well announces he's going to do this, but self-consciousness isn't necessarily a reason to accept a questionable choice).

I also understand how the first part of the book can be read as derivative of other works. However, I appreciate the effort to \*build\* on earlier work and not just point to McCloud (or Eisner) as if nothing else needs to written or said. I think his attempts to work through a comics version of auteur theory is interesting, and, while problematic, his "artcomix" category is an entry point towards thinking about different kinds of comics and how to read them, one that tries to move this discussion beyond the usual alternative-mainstream binary. 

I don't think these efforts are entirely successful, and his selection of artists for extended discussion betrays the limits of his approach. For example, I was struck by the absence of Dark Horse and people like Mike Mignola. It's easy to assume that they have been excluded because HELLBOY and BPRD, among other DH titles, are difficult to understand under the terms laid out in the discussion of auteurs and artcomix (Mignola rarely draws anymore, etc).

Despite these problems, here I am thinking about these questions, so consider me provoked.

I think that the provocation, though, is a function of scarcity.  There don't seem to be very many academic-critic books about comics.  Or really many any kind of critical books about comics.  Thus Wolk's book gets people to think about these questions simply because it exists, and it's an occasion for revisiting them.

I wasn't particularly into his discussion of auteur theory.  It's problematic to apply a movie concept to comics because of the far-reaching differences in means of production ... as he points out himself, but that doesn't really make it much better.  Movie concepts applied willy-nilly to comics turn into the same kind of thing that I saw here at Acephalous, where some commenter was demanding incredulously to know why it was a big deal that comics had reinvented the zoom shot, or something like that.  They aren't reinventions; different media may have similar aesthetic theories used within them, but require different techniques.  Bringing it up in this way "makes you consider the question", but in the same way that any introduction of confusion makes you reconsider questions.

And Wolk to my mind doesn't really build on McCloud.  He doesn't consider the full range of McCloud's ideas, and there are some things that McCloud rightly spends a lot of time on that he barely considers.  Webcomics, for instance, are a large part of _Reinventing Comics_, but a single paragraph in Wolk -- and the whole paragraph is inside a parenthetical.

_Aside from the license he gives himself in the "first book" to be selective in his choice of works for close readings, he doesn't seem terribly interested in actually using his own framework for criticism in the "second book", at least not in any kind of clear or purposeful way._ 

Thanks for articulating this directly.  Yes, this is exactly the problem, and in fact, as Rich points out, the first half of the book seems like a desultory justification for the more energetic readings he produces in the second half.  Some of those readings are intuitively brilliant---others, _a la_ Ditko, not so much---but the best of the second half highlights the conceptual failure of the first.  That is, he never sat down and studied his intuitive leaps to discern what allowed him to make them.

Put differently: as a literary scholar working within a field rife with _over_-articulations of conceptual frameworks---the obligatory "theory" chapter in dissertations, the justificatory introductions of most every manuscript---I don't feel the need to establish the _legitimacy_ of certain analytic moves, I merely need to explain in an intellectually responsible fashion why I chose some over others.  Wolk,  however, needed to establish the legitimacy of all his analytic moves, not just impress us with the making of them.  I don't want to harp on his discussion of Frank Miller's lines, but it's as good a place as any to start: since comics are cartooned---that is, made entirely out of lines working in accordance with some representational or aesthetic scheme---what makes some lines more significant than others?  In the Hernandez chapters, to use another example, he constantly refers to the grace lines that Gilbert uses to subtly alter expression and Jaime uses to gently age his characters, but he never indicates _how_ he knows those lines are the important lines.  I introduced the "grace note" analogy, but it's a good one: "grace notes" imply a structure that any competent musical theorist can identify, but are "grace lines" similarly established?  Do you need to be familiar with the idiosyncracies of the Hernandez brothers' personal style to understand the flourish, or is a general familiarity with comic representation enough to make them meaningful?

The fact is, while the book may have won an Eisner, it wasn't ever going to win an award from a Cultural Studies Association.  Admittedly, that wasn't his intended audience, but some day I hope it'll be mine.  So I think I agree with you Shaun, in that it's a provocative book, but it's 1) provoking me to conceptualize what we'd need to create a more rigorous theoretical approach to the medium but 2) as Rich said, it's also provocative by dint of scarcity.

I agree that the value of READING COMICS is inflated by the lack of comparable, and more rigorous works, and also that the power of the text to provoke is as much to do with its lacks or flaws as it does with its virtues. A few additional thoughts occur to me about his attempt to adapt auteur theory to comics - I think that Wolk is fairly conscious of the differences between film and comics and tries to work through those differences, for example - but I agree with Rich's basic point, which I take to be a caution against criticism by convenient analogy.
