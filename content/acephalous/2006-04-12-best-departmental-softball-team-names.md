## Best Departmental Softball Team Names

I'm on the Derridevils this year.  Here is an unapproved logo I whipped up:

Were I around when the team was named, I probably would've forwarded this suggestion:

I'm sure somewhere there's a compilation of the best departmental softball team names, but alas, I can't find it.  Further suggestions for names and/or logos are welcome.

"The Postmodern Wankers"?  The logo might be a bit inappropriate, though.

Surely someone has taken "Invisible Bullets"...

Also, I played on the "JuxtaPosse" and defeated the "Dover Bitches" in a rather esoteric match of intramural soccer last year.

I refuse to make a logo for "The Postmodern Wankers."  All evidence to the contrary, this is a _family_ blog.  Also, in order to conform with the original insult, wouldn't it have to be "The Gee-Whiz Postmodern Wankers"?

Natalia, not in my league, they haven't.  Grant, I like the JuxtaPosse, but that sounds a little more like an MFA team, no?  I'm surprised by how barren my usually puniful brain is on this topic.

Well, there's the unrelated idea I had to name some team I'm on "SparkleMotion" (from _Donnie Darko_) because of the double humiliation of being both defeated _and_ defeated by "SparkleMotion."

In grad school, I played for the pseudo-sponsor "Writer's Block and Tackle Shop," though it would have been a more fitting name for a football team.

Our department team was the Killer Verbs (red chiller font on white shirts.)   It struck so much fear in our enemies, they were forced to hide their terror behind false laughter and repeated home runs.

My department team one year in grad school was "The End of History," which was only funny because our rivals were from the history department...  And so we were kind of talking smack just by taking the field.

Actually, that's not even that funny.  What the fuck were we thinking?

Do you really think this group can help you out, Doggie Bitz?  Most of us don't even have personal softball names.
