Not only has Ambien

®

 cured [my insomnia](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/what-does-growing-up-entail-insomnia.html), it seems I now write and [publish](http://www.jstor.org/action/showArticle?suffix=3131751&seq=6&Search=yes&term=%!S(MISSING)EK+is+insensitive+to+issues+of+psychological+realism.%!&(MISSING)list=show&searchUri=%!F(MISSING)action%!F(MISSING)doBasicSearch%!F(MISSING)Query%!D(MISSING)%!S(MISSING)EK%!B(MISSING)is%!B(MISSING)insensitive%!B(MISSING)to%!B(MISSING)issues%!B(MISSING)of%!B(MISSING)psychological%!B(MISSING)realism.%26x%!D(MISSING)0%!y(MISSING)%!D(MISSING)0%!w(MISSING)c%!D(MISSING)on&item=1&ttl=1&returnArticleService=showArticle&resultsServiceName=null)
material I don't even understand _in my sleep_!  To wit:

It follows, implausibly, that nobody (else) prior to SEK had any justified beliefs!

Why would they have? 

In addition to previously mentioned qualms, I find three additional problems for SEK's position.

_You_ would.

First, there is a striking disunity in the treatment of _a priori_ and _a posteriori_ justifiedness. Only the latter is coherentist in contour, and only the latter features a metajustification requirement.

Keep telling yourself that.

Second, SEK assumes that justifiedness arises purely from logical and probabilistic relations between propositions, ignoring the causal process of belief production.

Whatever gets you through the day.

Third, SEK is insensitive to issues of psychological realism.

Am not!

SEK fails to address the significant category of stored beliefs, or the extent to which stored belief contents are accessible.

Did not! I totally addressed the extent to which stored belief contents were, you know, accessed by significant categories of themselves . . . and do you need me to tell you I don't actually take Ambien

®

 and am not sure how I accomplished this impressive feat of publication when I was nine years old?

It took me a minute to realize what this referenced, but SEK is actually rather notable in philosophical circles.  Congrats!

Oh, you really should take Ambien.  It is lovely.
