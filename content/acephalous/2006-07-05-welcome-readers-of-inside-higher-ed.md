Scott's [article](http://insidehighered.com/views/2006/07/05/mclemee) neatly summarizes the situation circa two weeks ago, but I suspect his panel had more of an impact than he suggested.  Since we spoke, I've received offers to review three pre-publication manuscripts and one published book.  (The book—Julian Wolfreys' [_The Old Story, With a Difference_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/081421021X/diesekoschmar-20)—will be reviewed on the Valve in the coming weeks.)  

I'll follow up later today with a more substantial response to Scott's article.  The potential conjunction of academia's reputation economy and academic publishing's bottom line could have a substantial impact on the future of the profession, and thus is something whose implications I need more than a single cup of coffee to work through.  (A damning expose on performance-enhancing drugs in academia, next on _Inside Higher Ed_?  Not quite.  I just need a few more hours of warm-up reading before I'm able to think about anything, much less something with implications.)
