Overhead on the way to office hours this morning outside the room where an exam had just ended:

**Student #1:** (_crying_) FUCK!  They're going to kick me out of school now!  It's no fair!  That book was like 150 pages long!  He can't test us on that shit!

**Student #2:** Well, maybe if  you'd read the book...

**Student #1:** (_violently screaming_) NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR A FUCKING LECTURE ON MY FUCKING STUDY SKILLS! (_resumes crying_)  It's not fucking fair him testing us on that book!  It's like 200 pages long!  They're going to kick me out!  FUCK!

There's nothing more to read.  I'm not sure why typepad thinks there is...

Go into the extended post box and click "edit HTML."  You've probably got some open/close paragraph code in there, which you won't be able to see when Typepad is in regular "compose post" mode.
