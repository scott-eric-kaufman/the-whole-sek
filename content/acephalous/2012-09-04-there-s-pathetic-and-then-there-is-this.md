## There's pathetic and then there is this.

Someone sent me [a link to this](http://bloggersdefenseteam.com/?DayByDayAuction) and asked me to analyze it:

[![bloggers defense team](http://bloggersdefenseteam.com/images/LastSupper.jpg "bloggers defense team")](http://bloggersdefenseteam.com/images/LastSupper.jpg)

What is this monstrosity? It’s a [Chris Muir print](http://www.daybydaycartoon.com/)

signed by the following giants of the Blogosphere: [Michelle Malkin](http://michellemalkin.com/), [Glenn and Helen Reynolds (Instapundit and Dr.Helen)](http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/), [Bill Whittle (Afterburner)](http://www.pjtv.com/?cmd=mpg&mpid=56), [Jeff Goldstein (Protein Wisdom)](http://proteinwisdom.com/), [Ed Morrissey (Hot Air)](http://hotair.com/hotair-tv-ed-morrissey-show/), [Robert Stacy McCain (The Other McCain)](http://TheOtherMcCain.com), and [Mandy Nagy (Liberty Chick)](http://libertychick.com/).

Where to begin the hilarity? If this is a play on "The Last Supper" why 
did Muir put Eric Holder in  the Jesus-spot? Why didn't he put Obama in 
the Judas-spot? How about the self-aggrandizing placement of the folks 
around the table: Sarah Palin and President Obama are equals, as are 
Michelle Malkin and Nancy Pelosi. Jeff Goldstein's just as influential 
as someone who could be Chris Matthews. (It's difficult to tell because 
Muir can't use the cartoon filter in Photoshop [any better than he can draw](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/05/in-political-commentary-a-little-nudity-goes-a-long-way).) But we needn't even worry about where people are at the table because the real hubris is _that they're there at all_.

The mind boggles.

**UPDATE:** As [noted in the comments](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/theres-pathetic-and-then-there-is-this/comment-page-1#comment-335964), the poorly drawn Democrats (and John Roberts) are affiliated with the phrase “_Exitus Acta Probat_,” which can also be found here:

![George Washington's Coat of Arms](http://www.americanheraldry.org/pages/uploads/President/Wash-mid.jpg "George Washington's Coat of Arms")

That’d be the coat of arms of that most traitorous of Americans—_George Washington_.

The mind boggles, then reels, then gets dizzy and feels a bit faint, not bad, but not quite right, know what I mean, a little, oh, let's say "squeamish," or whatever it is that is halfway between downright nauseous and just a little odd, sort of like when you eat an egg salad sandwich that's been on the picnic table for an hour and a half--not so much as to be downright dangerous, but did you really need to eat that--and then you start to wonder am I really feeling bad or am I just imagining that this is what the early stages of food sickness is like ohmygod getoutofmyway blecchhbarffffgaahh
