## Some words are best avoided when your nose starts to tickle.

**SEK:** But I don't think you fully appreciate the absurdity of the premise.  We're supposed to believe that grown men fly around fighting crime wearing tights with their knick—(_nose tingles_)—with their knick—(_nose tingles more_)—with their knick—(_here it comes!_)—_NIGGERS!_  

**CLASS:** (_stares mortified_)  

**SEK:**  . . . on the outside.  

**CLASS:** (_stares mortified_)  

**SEK:** Underpants.    

**CLASS:** (_stares mortified_)  

**SEK:** Tights with their _underpants_ on the outside.  Lesson time!  The "g" and "k" sounds are both velar stops, the difference being one's voiced and the other isn't.  I want everyone to repeat after me: "Kuh kuh kuh kuh kuh."  

**CLASS:** Kuh kuh kuh kuh kuh.  

**SEK:** Now try this: "Guh guh guh guh guh."  

**CLASS:** Guh guh guh guh guh.  

**SEK:** See the difference?  Your tongue moves the same way with both sounds, but with the "g" your vocal cords vibrate.  Let's play a game.  The "n" sound is voiced too.  I want everyone to say, "Nuck."  

**CLASS:** Nuck.  

**SEK:** Now say, "Nuck nuck."  

**CLASS:** Nuck nuck.  

**SEK:** See how your tongue anticipates the "n" in the second "nuck"?  It starts moving back there and voices the "k" a bit.  So: "Nuck nuck nuck nuck nuck nuck nuck."  

**CLASS:** Nuck nuck nu—  

**ONE VERY CONFUSED STUDENT:** This gonna be on the test?  

**SEK AND THE REST OF THE CLASS:** (_fall dead laughing_)

**For the record:** This happened a couple of quarters back.  I happened to bump into the VERY CONFUSED STUDENT the other day and he asked me why I never wrote about that class.  Now I have.

Had a similar moment a few weeks ago while reading a passage of \*The Odyssey\* out loud that features the word "niggardly."  I pronounced it really precisely: "nig-garddd-ly."  The girls kind of looked horrified at Homer's racial insensitivity.  I said, "No, no, those two words are completely unrelated."  One girl replied, "We're not stupid.  But why are you pronouncing it so weirdly?"  I felt like I'd been hit with the stupid stick.

'Stares Mortified' sounds like a character from a Victorian crime story.

I presume you've stuck to saying "underwear on the outside" since, in order to guard against having your sinuses betray you again?

 _I felt like I'd been hit with the stupid stick._

I'm glad it's not me this once.  Seriously, two or three times a class I say (or, more frequently, _do with technology_) something incredibly idiotic.

_'Stares Mortified' sounds like a character from a Victorian crime story._

Or from a pulp noir, only it'd be "Stairs Mortified," and he'd have a cheeky backstory.

_I presume you've stuck to saying "underwear on the outside" since, in order to guard against having your sinuses betray you again?_

Actually, I've gone with "tighty-whiteys," which I only now realize puts me in danger of yelling "TITTIES!"  I can't win.

LOL. You are SO going to be busted one day. Maybe even with a real bust.

I've had second thoughts, and now believe the Stairs Mortified lead up to the chamber containing the Seige Perilous.

Isn't that Steve Earle's line?
