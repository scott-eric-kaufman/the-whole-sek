## Finishing a Dissertation is like Flying a Plane ...

... except no one nails the landing the first time round.  Style points matter far less than survival.  For 29,000 feet you descend steady and calm before crosswinds cuff your nose.  You adjust expertly, but in vain.  You know what to do, but can't do it and are careening off the runway.  You have two unappealing options:

1.  Certain death.
2.  Circling around and trying again.

What do you do?

Perhaps next quarter I'll nail the landing in the traditional manner:

Style points?  They matter far less than survival.

Any landing you walk away from is a good landing....

The best dissertation is a finished dissertation....

Yup.

Wait -- doesn't the "circling around and trying again" metaphor indicate that Scott isn't in fact planning on finishing this quarter?  "The best dissertation is a finished dissertation" is saying that he should go ahead this quarter.

I dunno dude --- I'd practice landing something smaller first, a couple chapters, maybe an article, get my hours in before I tackle the big puppy. But \_don't\_ take advice for me as my academic career resembles \_Airplane\_ or perhaps even one of the cheezier \_Naked Gun\_ sequels --- the ones that are more painful than funny. 

Still... have you ever been in a Turkish prison, Tommy?

At this point, it makes no difference if you finish at the end of winter or the end of spring.  The important thing is to be officially finished -- filed, defended, paperwork submitted, listed on the transcripts -- by the time you apply for jobs next November.  Many committees won't even consider ABDs, even if the candidate's advisers insist that the candidate is actually finished with the diss.

What Luther Blissett said.  

I'm aiming for the summer two and a half point landing myself.

Blissett's right, yeah. 

If we're swapping literary analogues to our academic careers, I think my graduate years were _Waiting for Godot_ and my teaching years have been "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"....

We're all Walter Mitty's at heart. Common in our age.

Some of us are more Walter Mitty than others. But my point wasn't about my private imaginings, but about the narrative structure and themes of career experiences.

This reminds me of a story I've told before - Scott needs to know before he learns - When Scott was about 4 or 5 we decided to take him to the YMCA for swimming lessons.  When it was time for him to go into the pool, he refused.  Why you ask? Because he did not know how to swim. Therefore, he needed to go home and teach himself somehow, so that he could return and already know how to swim before he was taught.  This book does not have to be perfect to be finished.  After so many years it just needs to be done!  So, get working son and get done.

You're not finished yet?  Come on.  I've already had you as a teacher, graduated, moved away and gone to grad school, dropped out of grad school, moved home, entered a credential program, and...and...and...

I want you to finish.

I know it's late, but -- punt! "Punt" may not have anything to do with planes, but it's obviously what we all gotta do with the dissertations.

Punt?  I can't punt!  I know, I know, any port in a storm is suitable for punting, but I can't bring myself to do it.  Instead, I ignore it and how they award me the Ph.D. anyway.  Maybe if they don't notice I haven't turned it in ...
