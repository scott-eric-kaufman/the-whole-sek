Not that people who aren't me would be all that excited about it, but according to an email from one of the 17,841 academic listservs I've foolishly subscribed to, [The Complete Works of Charles Darwin](http://darwin-online.org.uk/) will available online this October.

And by "complete," I believe they mean all of them.  Plain text and _scanned images_ of the bard's breathlessly illegible script.  There will also be plain text versions of all the significant secondary material.  The current seraphic quality of countenance notwithstanding, I'm so hankering to read Darwin and his significant secondaries the idea of waiting until October--that's months after my summer dissertation grant (not to mention summer) expires--threatens my sanity.  I've led the Rabid Rabble before.  I can reassemble their ranks for some Rabid Rabble Rampaging.  I know the procedure.  Thems what knows best for theirs might should consider putting on in July what they might not lives to publish in October.
