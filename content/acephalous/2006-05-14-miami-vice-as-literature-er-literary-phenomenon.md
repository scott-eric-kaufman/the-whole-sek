## Miami Vice As Literature, Er, Literary Phenomenon

[Auto-X-posted from [The Valve](http://www.thevalve.org/).]

Reading a lovely, [Morrissey]()-evoking [post](http://badbadbadger.blogspot.com/2006/05/stop-me-if-youve-heard-this-one-before.html) on Hollywood’s decision to strip-mine the ‘70s and ‘80s for film ideas, it struck me that Michael Mann’s remake of _Miami Vice_ could be quite the unusual beast, textually-speaking.  (Whatever would a remake of _Airwolf_ totally [be](http://daveslongbox.blogspot.com/2005/09/airwolf-adjective.html)?)  When [_Heat_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006J28KU/diesekoschmar-20)
was released in 1995, a number of critics noticed some familiar
dialogue: Mann had recycled some scenes from his script for the _Miami Vice_ (1984) pilot.  (Would Roger Ebert have called _that_ “[an uncommonly literate screenplay](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19951215/REVIEWS/512150302/1023)”?)  As the IMDB [_Heat_ Trivia](http://imdb.com/title/tt0113277/trivia)
attests, Mann frequently borrows from his own work.  (It doesn’t note
this particular connection.) In a televised interview Sunday, Mann
claimed that he based the screenplay for the new _Miami Vice_ (2006) on the pilot.  Which means, hypothetically, that the same scene could be in the ‘84 pilot, _Heat_, and the ‘06 remake.  

What, then, would be the status of the text and the characters’
relation to it?  Would Vincent Hanna (Pacino) or Neil McCauley (De
Niro) be slyly alluding to an episode of _Miami Vice_?  Would they be presciently anticipating a scene from ‘06 remake?  Or would Crockett (Farrell) or Tubbs (Foxx) be alluding to _Heat_, a film which one can reasonably expect a detective in the Crockett or Tubbs mold to favor?  And what about [Jimmy Smits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami\_Vice#Television\_series)?

I know you don’t come to Valve with the expectation of it coming in the
air tonight, oh Lord, but as someone who works on authors who are
serial self-plagiarists—I see you back there, Mr. London—I’ve a keen
interest in the interplay of borrowed to original text when the same
person is responsible for both.  This isn’t an interest I’m
particularly articulate about, nor one that I’ve thought through
rigorously, so I’d be interested to hear what you would make of the
situation described above, or of any similar ones with which I may be
unfamiliar.  

[_Note: Because of the current internet pervasiveness of “Miami
Vice” and “Michael Mann,” I can’t track down any links for this, nor do
I own the [first season](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JLEY/diesekoschmar-20) of **Miami Vice**, so I can’t check up on it myself.  But I don’t think my memory’s **that** bad.  Yet._]

Y'know, I'd almost want to see an Airwolf movie, except that any CGI bird they come up with would be hard pressed to match the live action original for sheer coolness. [1]

That and the writers would have to restrain themselves from making Stringfellow more and more stoned the longer the movie went on, just to reflect the original series...

[1] Pointless trivia: Airwolf was designed by Andrew Probert, who was also responsible for the re-designed Enterprise in ST:TMP, and ST:TNG.

Jimmy Smits?  He's in the running to the President of the USA.  That's got to beat landing a job as a policeman who can't even afford to buy socks.

Re: Mann referenceing himself. He would justify it on the basis that all his characters, or rather the archetypes that he uses and explores right across all his films, all think in similar ways. This applies to their existential outlook (the phrase "time is luck" is used in THIEF, MIAMI VICE ('06), HEAT and MANHUNTER) and their moral codes.

Mann has even interconnected LAST OF THE MOHICANS to his cop universe, by implying that Eady is a decendent of Hawkeye and Cora....

So we shouldn't really look at this tendency as self-plagiarism. More that his characters are all engaged in seeking out the same answers and achieving similar outcomes. They are all 100%!&(MISSING)#39;dedicated' (a very important word in the Mann universe) to their goals, and will do anything to achieve them. From Jericho Mile onwards, you'll find so many convergences, you'll see it's all done intentionally......
