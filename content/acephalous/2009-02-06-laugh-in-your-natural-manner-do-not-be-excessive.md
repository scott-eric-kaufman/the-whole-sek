All the [crying](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=14222) [and](http://www.vanityfair.com/online/wolcott/2009/01/were-there-a-mens-cologne.html) [crowing](http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2009/02/pajamas\_media\_r.php)
over the death of Pajamas Media overshadowed the birth of the
awesomeness that is Pajamas Television.  Just today I watched Glenn
Reynolds, Michelle Malkin, and the Artisan Formerly Known as Joe the
Plumber [discuss](http://www.pjtv.com/?cmd=video&media-id=4522&video-id=1320&video-title=Conservatism\_20%!A(MISSING)\_Joe%!C(MISSING)\_Obama\_Appointments\_and\_Stimulus\_Fund&series-name=PJTV\_Daily\_) the first weeks of the Obama administration.  They showed behind-the-scenes footage of the Daschle debacle:

![reynolds1](http://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/reynolds1.jpg?w=300&h=227 "reynolds1")

They laughed _ha ha_ while the tape ran.  Then Reynolds showed it again _ha ha_.  Malkin said it was distracting _ha ha_.  Reynolds asked how that got in there again _ha ha_.  Is that the Obama administration or a car full of clowns _ha ha._ Who can tell _ha ha._ 

Because being on the cutting edge of
political commentary entails airing footage of a clown car while the
contemporary equivalent of “[Bag of Rags](http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%!E(MISSING)mistcla2/McKanlass.htm)” blares.  I couldn’t watch much more than the first five minutes—I kept waiting for Reynolds to pull a [full Saget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%!s(MISSING)\_Funniest\_Home\_Videos)
and show Obama getting beaned in the privates by a baseball.  But I saw
enough to capture the new face of serious journalism in all its
seriousness:

![reynolds2](http://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/reynolds2.jpg?w=300&h=268 "reynolds2")

Pajamas Television: where you can watch a
middle-aged man put every ounce of the fiber of his being into nailing
a lick on his air guitar.  Serious journalism for serious people _ha ha_.

Speaking of serious journalism, has Andrew Sullivan tracked down Trigg's real mom yet?  I've always meant to do some reading regarding rhetoric in the history of American politics, but I keep getting hung up on the question of whether Rachel Jackson really was a bigamist whore.

They're a bunch of morons, of course, but it doesn't take a genius to see that Obama is proving his critics right: lots of progressive talk but lots of business as usual.  Obama went swimming in the Clintonian pool of sharks and it's no surprise he's getting bitten in the ass.  Obama's Cabinet should have a been a group of eggheads; that was my dream, that Obama would surround himself with awkward but smart people.  Instead it's like a who's who of gladhanders, conflicts of interest, smarmy flip-floppers, and former torture supporters.

Luther, dude, your comment above is sad.  I was hoping not to have to quote this bromide in the next administration, but the Cossacks work for the Czar.  I think that Obama hired exactly whom he wanted to hire.  Nothing in his political history suggests that he's doing things differently now than he ever has done.

I'm not suggesting some weird equivalence between Bush and Obama.  Bush was the worst President ever; Obama is maybe a degree or two left of Clinton.  That's a huge, tremendous difference.  But really, come on.

Rich, I agree: Obama made these choices.  He doesn't even have a Cheney to blame it on.  And while Obama might be to the left of Clinton, he's also nowhere near as politically saavy as he.  So he's well on his way to being a shitty president if he tries to rock Clinton's look without having Clinton's body.

The end of this road will be a defeat by Sarah Palin (or whatever handpuppet the Right runs).  But, as in \*Airplane\*: "They bought their tickets, they knew where the plane was going.  I say, let em crash."

No, _this_ is Method Blogging - you're so deep in character you've forgotten that this makes nothing even remotely resembling sense, reflects none of the vast differences between the megalomaniac/sociopath Clinton and that brown fella, is just can't-wait-for-the-centrists-to-be-centrists-so-I-can-be-proven-RIGHT-again reactionary boilerplate, etc. Personally I think that's fucking awesome! I mean I went to the school where Chomsky 'teaches,' so this shit feels like a homecoming.

Actually, Wally, I'm quite a centrist myself.  My problem with Obama is that he's an opportunist, but, unlike Clinton, he's not an effective opportunist.  Clinton at least got some stuff done.  Obama's basically at the height of his power and is fucking up royally.  He's proving that he (a) has no principles and (b) can't even work the "typical politician" look.  

Thirty of those first hundred days are over, and what has he accomplished?  A year-long deferral in the possible shut-down of a military prison that, all in all, had probably no more rights abuses than your typical high-security state prison run by neo-Nazis, drug dealers, and rapists.

I'm actually more optimistic, Luther, in part because I think that Obama is probably as competent as Clinton was, in part because the rhetoric that Obama had to adopt means that his triangulation will be off of us, not off of Congress -- more annoying, but less damaging.

Actually I can't resist arguing [in the form of a poem](http://rpuchalsky.blogspot.com/2009/01/poetry-for-obamas-inauguration.html) that I wrote for Obama's inauguration, and which has survived for thirty days quite intact.
