1.  Which of the following quotations about Henry James appear in published scholarly works and which were invented whole-cloth by Y.T.?
a.  the passage "shows how in James a greater self-knowledge and a greater acceptance and specificity of homosexual desire transform this half-conscious enforcing rhetoric of anality, numbness, and silence into a much richer, pregnant address to James's male muse, an invocation to fisting-as-_ecriture_."

b.  an older James "plac[es] the reader less identification with the crammed rectum and more in identification with the probing digit."

c.  "I picture James's head hovering over a consummated toilet, a glossy, smooth turd lolling in the waters, pride summoning lost pleasures....Perhaps it was less than slippery, as he gripped it within his bowels like a mischievous boy, playing peekaboo with the exit, hiding it upstairs, clinging to it as to a departing lover."

I wager (a) is perhaps the real, (b) and (c) the ersazz,  the simulations  altered from some of your own marginalia to the  Allen Ginsburg's Ode to NAMBLA? When asked to James, choose Bill over Hank.  But I suspect the queering of Hank being a shall we say somewhat Zionist cunspiracy......
