1.  I am personally responsible for mucking up the Google Image Search for the word "[acephalous](http://images.google.com/images?svnum=100&um=1&hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%!A(MISSING)en-US%!A(MISSING)official&q=acephalous+&btnG=Search+Images)."
2.  A number of Blogger blogs disappeared from Google Reader this week.  Victims included [Quod She](http://quodshe.blogspot.com/) and [In the Middle](http://jjcohen.blogspot.com/).  Obviously, Google hates medievalists.

Scott--speaking of In The Middle and other [possibly scorned blogs--haha], I have written a post at Literature Compass [[http://literaturecompass.wordpress.com],](http://literaturecompass.wordpress.com],) cross-posted at In The Middle, that references your recent Valve and Acepahlous posts, hping thereby to widen the conversation you have instigated about the relationship of "what we do here" to issues of morality, etc., that I think are really really important. And thanks for that!

Hm. That's weird.  Maybe it's because I post so irregularly and they're punishing me for being a bad, bad blogger.

Or maybe some Googler had a bad experience in a Chaucer class (though really, how can that be possible???).

Mr Acephalous, you are making me uncomfortable with your melon-helmeted cat head.

Have you considered that maybe God hates marathoners?  I blame Ivan Tribble!

Dude, I had no idea you named your blog after a death metal band!
