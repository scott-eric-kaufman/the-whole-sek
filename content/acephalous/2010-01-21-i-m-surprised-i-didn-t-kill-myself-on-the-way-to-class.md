**STUDENT WORKER:** Someone's going to be awake for a few days.

**SEK:** Just long enough to teach I hope.

**STUDENT WORKER:** What do you teach?

**SEK:** Batman.

**STUDENT WORKER:** (_looks at SEK confused_)

**SEK:** (_looks at STUDENT WORKER confused_)

**STUDENT WORKER:** You teach "Batman"?

**SEK:** I said "Batman"?

**STUDENT WORKER:** You said "Batman."

**SEK:** Because I meant "English."

**STUDENT WORKER:** Really?

**SEK:** They're not as different as you think.

**STUDENT WORKER:** They're not?

**SEK:** I'm writing a book.

**STUDENT WORKER:** You are?

**SEK:** Now you see why I need these.

**STUDENT WORKER:** Good luck with that.

So you made it to class through all the sleet and rain and hail and flooded freeways?

PS Red Bull is the same stuff they use to flush your car transmission, I'm sure of it. Stay away from that stuff.

'Round my parts, we don't bother with Red Bull.  Just head over to [the Diesel](http://www.diesel-cafe.com/) (which unfortunately doesn't list their drinks menu online) and grab a Solid Six.  That's six shots of espresso in a mug.

" all the sleet and rain and hail and flooded freeways?"

I guess this explains why one of my friends' statuses is "LA can't handle weather."
