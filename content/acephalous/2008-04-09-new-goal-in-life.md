## New Goal in Life:

To be the first person to cite an article from _Homing News and Pigeon Fanciers' Journal_ in a dissertation submitted in an English department.\*

* * *

\*
 Francis Galton's "Notes on Fitting Normal Curves to Distributions of Speeds of Old Homing Pigeons" (6 April 1894): 159-60.  That my discussion will focus on [the shuffleboarders](http://www.stclairshores.net/parksrec/senior/Meyer%!a(MISSING)nd%!K(MISSING)renzer%!s(MISSING)huffleboard%!p(MISSING)ict.jpg) of the homing pigeon community is pure gravy.  Sadly, no one has thought to upload the "PASSENGER PIGEONS!" scene from [_Ghost Dog_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005QCVX/diesekoschmar-20) and my copy is VHS, so [this is the most pigeon I can muster](http://youtube.com/watch?v=g6dMTwURRns).

Probably there are no ferret-leggers in the homing pigeon community. Indeed, the two communities are probably bitter enemies.

When you're ready for more pigeon, I recommend watching [this](http://video.google.com/videosearch?num=10&so=0&q=vielle+dame+et+les+pigeons+duration%!A(MISSING)long&start=0).

A noble goal to feather the dissertation nest such.

After my last horrendous commenting experience, I thought I might leave well enough alone, but no.  I must ask small and pointless questions!  

First, who _are_ the shuffleboarders of the homing pigeon community.  Surely this is a metaphor rather than a venn diagram sort of thing.  

Second, isn't _Homing News and Pigeon Fanciers' Journal_ a rather strange and unbalanced construction?  I assume that it was the result of a merger between two previously separate publications, but normally isn't there some work done to shuffle the two prior names together (ie, Homing Pigeon News and Digest or something)?  

Finally, isn't [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPj3G7U-K04) the best of all possible pidgeon videos?

Emerson, 

Please tell me you wrote that entry yourself.  

eb,

That is, in fact, one sweet pigeon video.  (You know what I mean.)  

JPool,

_After my last horrendous commenting experience, I thought I might leave well enough alone, but no._ 

Couldn't have been _that_ bad if I can't even catch the specific reference. (Conversely, maybe's it _far worse_ and I remember too many.)

_First, who are the shuffleboarders of the homing pigeon community. Surely this is a metaphor rather than a venn diagram sort of thing._

What I meant was, _Homing News and Pigeon Fanciers' Journal_ is full of curmudgeonly remarks about other members of the pigeon fancier community.  I swear they're one step from actually calling their opponents whippersnappers.

_Second, isn't Homing News and Pigeon Fanciers' Journal a rather strange and unbalanced construction? I assume that it was the result of a merger between two previously separate publications, but normally isn't there some work done to shuffle the two prior names together (ie, Homing Pigeon News and Digest or something)?_

I don't actually know it's publishing history, since I'm trying to limit my footnotes to only the mildly irrelevant, as opposed to the hilariously unnecessary.  But you're right about the construction.  Damn it, now I'm actually interested in this but the Internet, [it is no help](http://www.google.com/search?q=%!H(MISSING)oming+News+and+Pigeon+Fanciers%!+(MISSING)Journal%!)(MISSING).  (It's me, eBay, the article itself and where I found it in JSTOR.)

It was likely only horrendous to me.  It was one of those cascade of typos that tell me I should go back to mistyping my own work.  I almost included a note to treat that second question as rhetorical, so as to avoid the spider-trap of footnotes, but it says something about my distractable state these days that I couldn't leave the question unasked.  

Kids today, they don't even know _how_ to fancy pigeons.
