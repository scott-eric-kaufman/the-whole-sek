Fun. Good luck! If that were closer I might go and meet all Teh Famous Bloggers, but I barely travel further than the distance between the library and the English Department as it is. 

I did love the statement below the announcement of your event though:

Information: The registrar has determined that for the purposes of class meetings, this Wednesday is a Monday.

How Kafkaesque! Or maybe Joseph Heller.

As Deleuze says, the best way to help the revolution is to finish your dissertation.
