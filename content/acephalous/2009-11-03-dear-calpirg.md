			You may be a [fine organization](http://www.calpirg.org/) and worthy of my support, but as an English teacher and human being, when your representative approaches me and says that you "work with the destruction of the environment and poverty," my first response is "To what ends, man?Â  _To what ends_?"

Huh, I actually work for CALPIRG, but they haven't let me in on the supervillain team-ups yet.  Not sure how exactly environmental destruction and poverty can be helpful to the health care reform campaign I'm running, but if we've got the resources, might as well figure out how to use 'em!

""To what ends, man?"

I love the way you Californians speak.
