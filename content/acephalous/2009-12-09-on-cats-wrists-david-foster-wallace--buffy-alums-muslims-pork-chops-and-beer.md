## On cats, wrists, David Foster Wallace, <em>Buffy</em> alums, Muslims, pork chops, and beer

**Translation:** Because of the situation outlined in the first bullet, Scott is stealing the material in this post from his _Facebook_ status updates. 

*   Scott thought typing with one hand would be easier. (Don't get any ideas, you dirty-minded lot. He busted his left wrist last night in a very manly fashion that didn't involve tripping over a belligerently hungry kitten _no not one bit_.)
*   Scott can't be the only one who thought the response ("I'm really fine. I'm _really fine_.") of the amnesiac played by Marc Blucas on _Castle_ this week to the question "What's your name?" was a coincidence. (Or is Scott all hopped up on the Joyce?)
*   Scott wonders whether it's just him or does [this](http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2009/12/14/091214fi\_fiction\_wallace?currentPage=all) really not sound like David Foster Wallace in the least?
*   Scott figured out the most efficient way to feel guilty: greeting his devout Muslim neighbor while marinating pork chops in beer. ("I was trying to find a way to make this more offensive to you, and I did!")
 Regular posting will resume when typing doesn't require I crook my arm to spite my labrum.Â

_I was trying to find a way to make this more offensive to you..._

Yeah, but you didn't do it on a fast-day, did you? You're not quite there yet.

Time to explore voice-input software?

But Scott, isn't one of DFW's most distinctive traits his ability to write in countless different registers and styles?  To say that this doesn't sound like him is basically to confirm what many of his readers (me included) have considered to be one of his most fascinating writerly qualities.

The voices in Oblivion, for instance, sound very different from those in Brief Interviews.

I think it's fair to say that his \*journalistic\* voice (from the cruise and state fair pieces) is pretty damn recognizable.  With the fiction, however, it's much harder to pin him down to one particular sound.

Sorry to hear that you've injured yourself in the line of duty.  I too have a couple of housecats and am always warning my 84 year old MIL to give them a little motivating nudge with her foot to keep them from doing the same to her.

I hope that you enjoy a mercifully painless recovery, as I did in the past.  And look on the bright side; you'll have your own built in weather change divining rod, so to speak-at least for the next ten years...

Best Wishes for a speedy recovery, and consider forcing one of your grad students to do your typing for a while.

Gah.  My surgically-repaired knees and shoulder are divining rods enough, thank you very much.\*  That said, I'm getting the impression people think I "have" grad students.  I guess I do, inasmuch as I'm married to one, but outside of that, I'm just an adjunct with a book contract and a big mouth.  I'm a nobody, which is why people who turn me into The Big Bad perplex me.\*\*

\*And by "you" I mean "people responsible for tearing up both my knees and my right shoulder."

\*\*And by "people" I mean "people with the initials 'J.G.'"

perhaps I am behind the curve, but isn't DFW dead? How is this piece only being published now?

Make the cat do the typing then, as penance!  I mean, I've been on youtube; I know that those jokers can play the piano...

Sorry to hear about the knees and shoulder too.  But at least living in California minimizes the suffering.

And gee, all this time I thought you were a college Professor; I didn't understand the nuance of lecturer differentiation.  Based on my limited experience in engineering school we had only Professors, the only difference being associate or full; and they all had grad students.  Anyway, good luck with the book project.
