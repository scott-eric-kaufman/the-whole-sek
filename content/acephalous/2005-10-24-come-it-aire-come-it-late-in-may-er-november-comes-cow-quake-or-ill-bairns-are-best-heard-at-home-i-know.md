Grant Proposal Writing Season is upon us!  Certainly the most wonderful time of the year 'round here.  I imagine all the things I'll barely be able to afford if I win the grants I know I'll fail to score and then I die a little more inside.  (Yes, I know, "Ye drive a Snail to Rome.")  Yet despite this knowledge I insist on filling out endless forms, spending my days revising my work to suit some committee's conception of worth and my nights fretting over things which will not forestall my inevitable failure.  (True, "Wit in a [gowk](http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/getent4.php?plen=3805&startset=20434794&query=Gowk&fhit=gowk&dregion=form&dtext=dost#fhit)'s head and mosse on a mountain avails nothing," but I persevere.)

Why do this to myself?  Why not?  What better do I have to do during my last year of teaching eligibility?  Drink?  ("Quhen wine is in wit is out!")  Work on the actual version of my chapter?  ("Many smalls make a great!")  Why should I finish that?  ("Rome was na bigged the first day!")  

Now that we can table that most ungentle wheeze (and its Scotch _antistrophê_), I want to share the sort of sentence I produce when consolidating months of research into coruscant sentences:
From the various threads of unrelated Darwinian
thought Hofstadter wove a rope by which to hang his Social Darwinist. Critics see the noose swinging and infer the
hanging _even though_ its loop has never snapped tight.

This damnable London chapter will be finished as soon as I stop writing around the issue and start addressing it directly.  Circumlocution pads page counts but little else.  I produce mounds of fluff in every draft of every chapter because I must stuff the pillows before I place them firmly on the face of Social Darwinism.  This strikes me as the excessive but necessary result of conceiving chapters _not as chapters_ but as potential articles.  To think of them as proper chapters encourages tame reference to points already proven; to think of them as articles entails frantic recapitulations of the entire dissertation.  ([Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recapitulation\_theory)?  Indeed!)  

All of which is only to say that posting may be light through the end of October.  As [the Scots say](http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/scprv10.txt), "he that does bidding never deserves dinging."  I've bidding aplenty to do and don't much care for being dung.  But if I'm dung, at least I can comfort myself with the knowledge that "he is fairest dung when his own wand dings him."

We writers still live in feudal times where we have to kiss the ring on the king's hand to get any favour - or funding.... I think that if we seek to express truth freely - and free - this whole sham will collapse... the market or marketability is just another mask, strategem for censorship...
