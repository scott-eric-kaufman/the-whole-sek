		<span id="comment-14974779-content"><p>Another feature of blogging protocol which doesn&#39;t seem as-yet to have got itself sorted out is the Comments things.  You&#39;re taking the lack of comments on your shouty blog from yesterday(<i>were</i> you shouting?  I thought you were impersonating DEATH from Terry Pratchett&#39;s novels ...) as a sort of silent-protest, an indication that &#39;we&#39; didn&#39;t like it.  But maybe we <i>did</i> like it, just couldn&#39;t think of anything intelligent to say in response, and didn&#39;t feel like commenting endless variations of &#39;cool entry, man!&#39;  Or maybe &#39;we&#39; were busy, or away from our machines, or whatever.  But post merit seems to be measurable only in terms of comments-<i>quantity</i>, such that if you post at <i>Valve</i> and get 120 comment you think &#39;hmm, that was clearly a good &#39;un&#39;.  Or, do you think that?  What if 115 of the comments were saying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Feare" rel="nofollow"> &#39;die, Bart, die&#39;</a> or equivalents?  What if the Comments are swelled with invitations to pass Nigerian lottery winnings through your bank account, or queries about whether your girlfriend is satisfied with your performance ... ?</p>

<p>But you see what I mean.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-14975492-content"><p>I wasn&#39;t shouting, no, at least I don&#39;t think I was.  I certainly had the Caps Lock depressed, and when I was writing it I was shouting in my head--much to my own amusement, too.  As for the valuation of post merit: I certainly don&#39;t judge the quality of what I&#39;ve written based on the quantity of the comments.  Quantity is directly related not to &quot;quality&quot; but &quot;infammatory quality.&quot;  I can often predict which Valve threads will generate the most light, if not heat; but those aren&#39;t my best ones.  </p>

<p>Normally I don&#39;t mind commentlessness posts; it only itches when I feel I&#39;ve started a discussion and everyone&#39;s all like, &quot;Whatever, dude, whatever.&quot;  </p>

<p>P.S.  I&#39;ve been reading your <i>History</i> and just got around to reading the Preface.  The bit about how much you &quot;appreciated&quot; the contribution of the British Arts and Sciences Board killed me.  My world exploded in a non-Delany-esque way.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-14975960-content"><p>I&#39;ve met you, and your voice is now what I hear when I read. Before that, I heard you in my voice--that is, the voice in my head that narrates _everything_.  I don&#39;t imagine people&#39;s voices really, but when you said you had a beard I immediately heard a gravelly James Coburn voice in my head, which turned out to be wrong. I like your voice though, it&#39;s approachably warm and not too old. I don&#39;t know why, but I associate beards with gravelly voiced, bitter old men.I&#39;ve mentioned my unhappiness at having such a young, girly voice--did you not find it so?  In my head, I have the voice of a 35 year old whose vocal chords have been strained a bit by cigarettes and alcohol. But since I&#39;m 10 years younger and don&#39;t drink or smoke, I sound like Shirley Temple.</p>

<p>Do we ever sound to others the way we sound to ourselves?  In timbre, pitch and tone, or in words? Here&#39;s to hoping that no matter what we &quot;sound&quot; like, our words will convey us honestly.</p>

<p>By the way, your popularity is not dependent on how many people commment on/validate your posts.  If I relied on that as an indicia of blog value, I&#39;d be like the protoplasmic soup in the TTLB ecosystem. </p></span>

Um, I mean, I never read other people&#39;s work in my voice.  Strange how fundamentally different people read.  To me, A.P. Press releases sound like Stephen Hawking; John McPhee, in addition to sounding <i>exactly</i> like John McPhee, also sounds a bit like Ralph Waldo Emerson; and Kurt Vonnegut sounds like I imagine I sound when I write.  Do all these voices in my head reflect poorly on my sanity?  &#39;Cause if so, crap.  I haven&#39;t even really started yet.  </p>

<p>Also, I didn&#39;t find your voice &quot;girly&quot; so much as &quot;clipped and intellectual,&quot; which aligns with my expectations.  And I don&#39;t have a &quot;beard,&quot; Belle; I have one of those hipster (if by &quot;hipster&quot; you mean &quot;Don Johnson&quot;) five-o&#39;clock shadows, the permanent ones, born of a hatred of razors and their painful routines.  Set the clippers as low as they&#39;ll go and &quot;shave&quot; away!  (That said, as Zach and Jamie will no doubt quickly attest, in the middle of quarters I often <i>appear</i> to be bearded, but that&#39;s an illusion caused by <i>their</i> academic abjection, not a reality caused by mine.)  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-14986382-content"><p>Hey, you called it a &quot;lightly trimmed beard,&quot; and so in my head, you looked like Commander William Riker (I need to stop watching so much Star Trek).  But the voice in my head was James Coburn&#39;s from &quot;Affliction.&quot;  Great movie. I love Russell Banks.  </p>

<p>And I am pleased to hear that I didn&#39;t sound &quot;girly.&quot;  This is why I&#39;m trying not to drink sissy fruity drinks anymore--no more midori sours, cosmos, etc. I don&#39;t need that kind of help. &quot;Clipped and intellectual&quot;--I like that! It&#39;s like Katherine Hepburn.  Thanks!  </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it weird meeting people you only know virtually?  I expected you to look like a rumpled grad student like the TAs I had as an undergrad, but you looked and sounded like an olde school avuncular professor. And I mean that as a compliment. I expected t-shirts, wrinkledness, maybe a stale scent of whiskey lingering about you. I am serious, that is what my Com Lit TA was like.  Instead, you were nicely tweedy and sartorial. That&#39;s cool. I once TA&#39;d for a professor who always put on a tie for lecture, saying that he wanted the kids to know that class was an occasion for learning. I loved that, and vowed to emulate it (in my own feminine way of course).  And coming from a Californian _law school_, where all professors wear business casual (khakis, button downs, no tie, sneakers), where you would _think_ professionals/professors would dress up, it&#39;s nice to know some still wear a sport coat. <br />

		<span id="comment-15135510-content"><p>I don&#39;t know of any critical sources that deal with exactly this question, but I&#39;ve thought about it a lot: scattered observations follow below.</p>

<p>We ask of poetry and fiction (as we do NOT usually of academic writing) that the language in which it is composed have &#39;style&#39; or &#39;voice&#39; (though it is not spoken aloud) distinct enough to be legible through the eye; it is embedded in the words and their order.  This is not to say that the writer&#39;s actual real-life voice may not affect the way we hear the voice on the page (generations of readers traumatized by those recordings of T. S. Eliot reading his own poetry aloud, for instance; or the enriching of the voice on the page by the recording of Dylan Thomas&#39;s &quot;A Child&#39;s Xmas in Wales&quot;; or the slightly awful fake-English-accentness of Sylvia Plath, again in those records).  We may, for instance, find things much funnier if we hear them read aloud by the author--Kafka read pieces aloud to his friends &amp; it is documented that they were rolling around on the floor with laughter, a quality that is possibly implicit in the style but is often effaced in translation.</p>

<p>(I agree with you in finding Don DeLillo&#39;s narrative voices extremely irritating, by the way, and for many of the reasons you describe.  I love the opening stretch of Underworld but was perplexed and disappointed by the rest of it, especially by that awful knowing narrative voice; and I really can&#39;t stand White Noise, I find it impossible pretentious!)</p>

<p>Academic writing is in general less likely to be so stylishly written that you can hear the personal voice without having also heard the actual voice of the author.  (There are exceptions--Franco Moretti for instance has a lovely critical voice, and so do any number of other scholars--but it&#39;s not standard.)  In some rather wonderful cases, though (and this is really what your post made me think of), there&#39;s an effect like those coloring books you have as a child, the ones in which apparently gray/monochrommatic illustrations when you wash them with water turn into bright colors.  Sometimes something about the mannerisms or intonation of the speaker&#39;s actual voice tips you off after the fact to something in their critical style, so that afterwards you can EXTRAORDINARILY distinctly hear the &#39;voice&#39; that was previously inaudible to you.  My colleague Jonathan Arac is an excellent example of this, I hope he won&#39;t mind me saying; or my colleague Sarah Cole (author of Modernism, Male Friendship and the First World War) another example, you can hear her voice very distinctly in the writing but only, I think, if you&#39;ve heard her (very appealing, this is a complimentary thing not a critical one) speaking voice.</p>

<p>I find the blogs I read most regularly are the ones with the most distinct voices (this is what sets Michael Berube&#39;s blog over and above so many others, for instance, the appeal of his voice as well as of his critical intelligence).  It is one test of good writing, I suppose, whether it conjures voice (that need not be a close analog to the author&#39;s real-life speaking voice, though it usually is quite close); Scott, yours is good for this, you&#39;ve got a very appealing style that comes through not just here but also in your posts at the Valve.  Humorous, sometimes self-deprecating, but thoughtful &amp; very intelligent as well--it&#39;s good stuff.</p>

<p>I have gone on long enough....</p></span>

<p>Jenny, I don&#39;t know from those coloring books, but I will say that, outside of Berube, Arac&#39;s someone whose voice is instantly recognizable.  As is that of one of my advisors--and a friend/competitor of his--Brook Thomas.  Something about that generation of scholars, I&#39;m inclined to think; or maybe something about that breadth and depth of knowledge, I don&#39;t know.  That said, despite having heard Arac speak on two occasions, my impression of him as a stylist predated those lectures; those came from reading <i>Critical Genealogies</i> as a first year and <i>Huckleberry Finn As Idol and Target</i> in Thomas&#39; seminar.  So I suppose I&#39;m disagreeing with you in a way that&#39;d flatter Arac: I think his voice compelling on the page irrespective of whether one has heard him speak.</p>

<p>Oddly, I didn&#39;t factor modernists reading their own work despite the fact that my revelatory <i>Wake</i> moment was hearing Joyce read it.  Must think more on this.  Finally, I thought the Kafka story went the other way around, <i>i.e.</i> that he thought they were hilaorious but everyone sat there stone silent.  If you&#39;re correct, however, that blows one of my favorite classroom anecdotes to bits (and means I&#39;ve misinformed a generation of future literary critics).   </p></span>

<p>On Kafka, we all know not to trust things taken off the internet, but here&#39;s something more or less ok-looking:</p>

<p>&quot;The very formality on which Kafka’s stories turn makes his stories, as awful as they were, funny.  As Kafka’s friend and biographer Max Brod recalled:</p>

<p>When Kafka read aloud himself, this humor became perfectly clear.  Thus, for example, we friends of his laughed quite immoderately when he first let us hear the first chapter of The Trial.  And he himself laughed so much that there were moments when he couldn’t read any further.  Astonishing enough, when you think of the fearful earnestness . . . </p>

<p>And the reference for the essay is <a href="http://www.law.buffalo.edu/dwestbro/KafkaLaughter.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.buffalo.edu/dwestbro/KafkaLaughter.htm</a> and the reference for the quotation is Max Brod , Franz Kafka: A Biography 178 (G Humphreys trans.) (1937).</p></span>

WHAT IS IT!!! WHAT DO YOU HEAR AS I TYPE THIS??? SO ANYWAY TO READ THE INSPIRATION CLICK BELOW THE FOLD. SCOTT THINKS THERE IS SOMETHING INTERESTING IN THIS EVEN THOUGH IT IS SO ANNOYING!!! P.S. THANKS FOR JOINING MY FRAPPR!!!! YES THAT IS FOUR EXCLAMATION POINTS BECAUSE IT HAS ONE ALREADY!!! YOU SEE THE FORMULA. ALSO P.P.S. TO LAST NIGHT'S MYSTERY INTERLOCUTOR. YOU MADE SCOTT LAUGH FOR AN HOUR STRAIGHT AND FOR THAT SCOTT THANKS YOU!!! THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO TOLAXOR (SCROLL DOWN TO COMMENT #8) IS HERE: DID YOU KNOW WHY THEY CALL THEM WHITE CASTLES??? THERE'S AN OBSCURE GREEK FABLE IN WHICH ARTEMIS ( THE VIRGIN GODDESS OF THE MOON, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN) TAKES A FANCY (DIRECT TRANSLATION) TO A YOUNG SPARTAN NAMED PHIL!!! EVERY NIGHT FOR A FORTNIGHT, ARTEMIS VISITS PHIL IN HIS HOVEL TEMPTING HIM TO RETURN HER LOVE AND JOIN HIM IN THE SKY AS HER ETERNAL LOVER!!! EACH NIGHT, PHIL THE SPARTAN DECLINES, AS HE'S ACTUALLY SECRETLY IN LOVE WITH A HAIRY GREEK LADY NAMED APINE (PRONOUNCED APEEN) WHO, HERSELF IS THE QUEEN OF THE GREAT KING OF THE ISLAND OF LIPSI, TIM!!! TIM, KING OF LIPSI, IS FABULOUSLY FAMOUS BECAUSE HIS ROYAL THRONE IS A GIANT...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/sw_mitchells_hi.html"><span><strong>S.W. Mitchell's &quot;Hints for the Overworked&quot;</strong> Silas Weir Mitchell's best known for locking Charlotte Perkins Gilman in an attic for a couple of months. (If it not for him, millions of undergraduates would've been denied the pleasure of reading &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper.&quot;) I've read a little Mitchell [thanks Miriam] lately and wanted to share some of his sound advice for mental laborers with my mentally laboring audience. First and foremost, you people are filthy. Intellectually filthy. Achtung! Strip and deposit your filthy self in a frigid tub immediately! A great lawyer, whom [Mitchell] questioned lately as to this matter, told [him] that his cure was a chapter or two of a novel, with a cold bath before going to bed; for, said he, quaintly, “You never take out of a cold bath the thoughts you take into it.” Did I not mention the novel? Achtung! Relax with a novel! Still feeling unduly taxed? Ride a horse! There is a Turkish proverb which occurs to me here, like most proverbs, more or less true: &quot;Dreaming goes afoot, but who can think on horseback?&quot; Still feeling overworked? There's nothing Mitchell and I can do for you. But here's what to expect: When an overworked and worried victim has sufficiently sinned against these simple laws, if he does not luckily suffer from disturbances of heart or stomach, he begins to have certain signs of nervous exhaustion. As a rule, one of two symptoms appears first, though sometimes both come together. Work gets to be a little less facile; this astonishes the subject, especially if he has been under high pressure and doing his tasks with that ease which comes of excitement. With this, or a little later, he discovers that he sleeps badly, and that the thoughts of the day infest his dreams, or so possess him as to make slumber difficult. Unrefreshed, he rises and plunges anew into the labor for which he is no longer competent. Let him stop here; he has had his warning. Day after day the work grows more trying, but the varied stimulants to exertion come into play, the mind, aroused, forgets in the cares of the day the weariness of the night season, and so, with lessening power and growing burden, he pursues his purpose. At last come certain new symptoms, such as giddiness, dimness of sight, neuralgia of the face or scalp, with entire nights of insomnia and growing difficulty in the use of the mental powers; so that to attempt a calculation, or any form of intellectual labor, is to insure a sense of distress in the head, or such absolute pain as proves how deeply the organs concerned have suffered. Even to read is sometimes almost impossible; and there still remains the perilous fact that under enough of moral stimulus the man may be able, for a few hours, to plunge into business cares, without such pain as completely to incapacitate him for immediate activity. Night, however, never fails to bring the punishment; and at last the slightest prolonged...</span></a></div>
