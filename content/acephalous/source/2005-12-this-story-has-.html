		<span id="comment-11766163-content"><p>I&#39;d imagine that the entire experience might be a bit annoying.  I mean, first of all, write lots of clever and thoughtful pieces, get little response; summarize humorous sex story, get universal attention.  (And no, when I say &quot;story&quot;, I&#39;m not questioning its <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/who_can_write_i.html#comment-10283863" rel="nofollow">veracity</a>; if you&#39;re going to write <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/who_can_write_i.html#comment-10210066" rel="nofollow">literary journalism</a>, cultivate a devil-may-care attitude like a real journalist.)  But there&#39;s nothing new about that.  Second, the reactions on display in comments contain some funny material (Don&#39;s allegory: brilliant), but wouldn&#39;t Foucault have a field day with a good deal of it?  It&#39;s the panopticon in reverse; many observers and one hapless example to draw disciplinary scorn.  Somebody could get enough material for a quick, dismissive article about American culture just by counting the number of comments about this on all the linking blogs that involve the words &quot;video&quot; or &quot;camera&quot;, much less the get-tough or punishment-fantasizing ones.</p></span>

America can be one big happy family.  Actually, so far the most surprising reaction I&#39;ve read was to <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2005/12/and-i-thought-it-was-shocking-when-i.html" rel="nofollow">Ann Althouse</a>&#39;s post on it.  Someone named &quot;<a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2005/12/and-i-thought-it-was-shocking-when-i.html#113357029837230207" rel="nofollow">Harkonnendog</a> said:</p>

<blockquote>Er- this is just fuggin&#39; disgusting. Those kids, at least the male, need to be tossed out of the school, for the disrespectful language alone, if sex in random teachers&#39; offices is allowed, which it apparently is, given the teachers reaction.

<p>And if that teacher is a man, double wtf. I mean that boy NEEDS a beatdown badly.</blockquote></p>

<p>I <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2005/12/and-i-thought-it-was-shocking-when-i.html#113357442205496060" rel="nofollow">replied</a> the only way I could:</p>

<blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what it is about my reaction that makes you think students are allowed to have sex in random teacher&#39;s offices. I thought it signified the exact opposite. As for not beating down the guy, well, UCI has a strict &quot;No Beating Down Students Even When They So Richly Deserve It&quot; policy.</blockquote>

<p>Oh, and since it&#39;s Friday night, I refuse, on principle, to consider what Foucault would have thought about it.  He can have Saturday morning. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-11772032-content"><p>I think that the sudden ubiquity of the post has more to do with Scott-ish flair and less to do with the fact that, as Rich says, the post has SEX!SEX!SEX! in it.  After all, it&#39;s not as if there&#39;s any lack of sexual reference online.  In fact the ratio of sexstuff to nonsexstuff on the web is the same as the ratio of water to other chemicals in the human body.  Or something like that.  Had Scott just posted &#39;hey! saw some students having-all-the-sex in my office! Rad!&#39; I don&#39;t believe he would have become a meme.  [Brit-joke: &quot;<i>I am a meme.  My body is my tool</i>&quot; ... I wouldn&#39;t expect anybody outside the UK or born after 1970 to get that particular cultural reference].  It was the way it was written; the deftly comic use of dramatic form etc., that made the post.  Credit where it&#39;s due.</p></span>

(And Scott&#39;s own protestations of veracity, which I believe, indicate that we can&#39;t really give him credit for writing the major elements of it).  I don&#39;t think it was precisely the sex that made it so popular, either, I think it was the combination of sex, vicarious enjoyment of embarassment, and, for some people, the desire to participate in societal disapproval.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-11780900-content"><p>IMHO, it was a combination of Scott&#39;s writing and the unexpected reaction of the couple to being caught <i>in flagrante delicto </i>. If the couple had hustled into clothes and left blushing and mumbling apologies, the story would have engendered a few chuckles, little more. The chutzpah of the attempt at making Scott the person who should be embarrassed is the stuff of belly laughs. </p>

<p>PS I don&#39;t think Don&#39;s allegory quite works since the girl was weeping because of Scott&#39;s interruption, not because of her chosen partner.</p>

		<span id="comment-11787676-content"><p>Frederick, don&#39;t worry about that.  If it hadn&#39;t happened to me, I wouldn&#39;t have believed it either.  At the beginning of the other thread, I mentioned that my office has become something of the department&#39;s storage room . . . and that since the quarter started it&#39;s become increasingly cluttered.  So if you don&#39;t look at the path I&#39;ve cleared to my desk--by moving all the boxes, books, capsized desks, chairs and bookshelves--you&#39;d think it was uninhabited.  And if the person who deposited said &amp;c. in my office forgot to lock the door behind him or her . . . well, you see where I&#39;m headed.  I didn&#39;t provide all the details initially because, well, because the story&#39;s funnier outside explanatory contexts.  But they should have seen my name on the door, my books on the shelves, my essays on the desk beside those of my students, the trash full of used coffee cups and everything else which indicated that this wasn&#39;t an unoccupied office.  As for not reporting them, I wouldn&#39;t know how or to whom, plus I felt terrible for the woman who, it seemed to me, had been assured by her paramour that there was no way they&#39;d get caught.  Plus I had a student there and more on the way and didn&#39;t want to make a scene.  I know, I know, I&#39;m everything that&#39;s wrong with America . . . </p>

<p>Adam, I don&#39;t catch the reference but I appreciate the sentiment, since as a teacher of literary journalism I like to think that I distill detail with the best of &#39;em . . . or at least the adequate.  For example, I didn&#39;t include her caterwauling throughout because that would&#39;ve obscured the hilarity of his anger.  But because I have a commitment to the truth, I did mention it at the end, thereby allowing the reader to infer its continual presence without ruining the comedic effect.  </p>

<p>Rich, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re wrong on any counts.  The fact that this was the third most linked site last week according to Blogpulse attests to the general, un-Scott-specific appeal of this post.  I think it captured a moment, and you know what, if it doesn&#39;t win the Koufax Award for funniest post of the year, I&#39;ll be mildly upset but grateful that you and all my other fair-weather readers nominated me.  </p>

<p>Darleen, you speak the truth.  To be honest, I wish they had just up and left and not provided me with the anecdote of a lifetime.  I first wrote this up about forty-five minutes after it happened (<i>i.e.</i> when I finished meeting with my student) and then, when my hyper-caffeinated self sat down in staff meeting, blurted out the whole affair.  Because this was a literary journalism staff meeting, I was grilled on the details and my presentation of them by professionals.  (The Big Kahuna in the meeting being <a href="http://pulitzer.org/year/2002/feature-writing/" rel="nofollow">Pulitzer Prize-winning</a> investigative reporter <a href="http://barry-siegel.com/" rel="nofollow">Barry Siegel</a>.)  When I got home I put it on the blog because I knew that if I didn&#39;t, my student (who, like all my students, has posting privileges on my courseblog) would have.  But I didn&#39;t anticipate this kind of attention.  As Rich pointed out, I&#39;ve often written about academic oddities . . . so maybe I should&#39;ve realized that this had broader appeal.  I suppose I should&#39;ve.  </p>

<p>But to wrap this up for the folks at <a href="http://www.snopes.com/" rel="nofollow">Snopes</a> who emailed this morning, that is an accurate account of what happened . . . so long as you leave out her tears, which the more popular this post becomes, the more I feel like an ass for ignoring.</p></span>

I could have mentioned <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22Not+the+Nine+O%27Clock+News%22+%22I+am+a+mime%22&meta=" rel="nofollow"> alternative carpark</a>, but that would have been even more baffling.  (I really must leave the 1980s behind, and move into the broad sunlit uplands of the 21st century).  The sentiment, however, endures.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-11822566-content"><p>Wow, 70 hits from Cornell&#39;s email server! I have a feeling some of my students saw the post at my site and went wild with it. </p>

<p>I must admit that I find it odd that this story took off like it did. I found if funny because I&#39;m a grad student. At Cornell, we often leave our offices open while we get coffee or smoke or whatever. It&#39;s not that strange to me that the office might be open. It&#39;s something that I related to, and knowing that many of my readers are fellow grad students, I figured they would find it amusing too. The reactions of the students amused me more than the sex part. Most graduate instructors have dealt with similar indignant reactions from students under different circumstances, I&#39;m sure. </p>

<p>Assuming that the Cornell hits are at least partly my fault, I do have to wonder why they didn&#39;t follow the links to all the other excellent posts here that I&#39;ve linked to. Oh yeah. 18 year olds are sex-obsessed!  </p></span>

That conversation ended on Thursday, Kevin. Racism? Solved it last week. Some people simply don't know how to move on. But I'll humor Kevin and pretend that &quot;race&quot; still matters for a moment. On December 3rd, Kevin wrote about &quot;Shirley Q. Liquor&quot; (pictured left) a gay white drag queen who sings songs like &quot;The Twelve Days of Kwanzaa&quot; whose patently offensive lyrics &quot;Shirley&quot; performs in blackface. Step back for a second and think about that. A homosexual man who attracts other homosexual men by dressing like a woman pretends to be African-American and then performs overtly racist songs. As I said on Kevin's site, I cannot parse this absurdity outside of an institutional context. If Mr. Knipp—a.k.a. &quot;Shirley Q. Liquor&quot;—were a former student of Judith Butler's I would consider this &quot;performance&quot; a poorly executed &quot;subversion&quot; of something vaguely &quot;political.&quot; As it stands, I'm confused. As I originally wrote: This is the first I'd heard of this, and to be honest, I'm baffled. Half the sites Google turns up claim it's an over-the-top parody of white racism, i.e. a (pardon my Theory) queering of the stereotype of black women by a drag queen. The other half claim Knipp himself is a racist affiliated with a variety of hate groups. So is this quasi-academic pastiche with the wheels come off, a &quot;queering&quot; without the concomitant recuperation of the word and concept &quot;queer,&quot; or is Knipp an actual racist? At what point does poorly executed political provocation appropriated by hate groups stop being progressive and start, by dint of association, to be what it purportedly condemns? In other words, is this another collision between the politically left-of-center and the &quot;politics&quot; of the academic left? I couldn't find any real information about Knipp's life of the mind, but wouldn't a drag queen be more attuned to the nuances implicit in performance? Or has he read Butler and become so enamored with the logic of his protest that he fails to see its actual effect? I should note that much of what I'm saying arises from that same Old Lefty place that informs my criticism of identitarian politics: &quot;Yes, yes, your theories are liberatory but their implications are beyond dire.&quot; I chuckle, then die a little more inside, every time I see the logic of academic relativism bulwarking conservative arguments about, say, Intelligent Design. Ugh. Also, if I've said anything too offensive, I hereby declare that it was entirely unintentional, the product of too many years trying to be a Leftist in a discipline in which &quot;leftist&quot; thought is a badge which comes with blinkers and a bullhorn. So what do you, my vastly expanded readership, think about this &quot;racist&quot; performance? I condemn it on all counts, but I'm not sure which count in particular earns my condemnation. Should I condemn him for being a &quot;racist&quot; or a racist? Or has...</span></a></div>
