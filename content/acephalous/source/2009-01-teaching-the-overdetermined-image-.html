			<p>As anyone who teaches funny books or films knows, the task of
convincing students that the scene before them is anything other than
incidental would try Job’s patience.&#0160; You show them a panel from the
surprisingly awful <em>Superman and Batman vs. Aliens and Predator</em> like, say, this </p><p>
</p>

<center><img alt="image" border="0" name="image" src="http://www.thevalve.org/uploads/panel1.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 566px;" /></center>

<p>
and ask them to talk about the image as a crafted artifact and they
will sit there, stone-silent, for fifty minutes while you prattle on
about how (1) the writer wanted Batman represented by a powerful gloved
hand and (2) the original alien was a giant penis preying on (a) the
crew of the <em>Nostromo</em> and (b) our inborn fear of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenomorph_%28Alien%29#Creation_and_design">alien interspecies rape</a>.&#0160; You show them the H.R. Giger painting that inspired Ridley Scott:
</p>
<p>
</p><center><img alt="image" border="0" name="image" src="http://www.thevalve.org/uploads/hr-giger-6.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 225px;" /></center>

<p>
and tell them that there’s phallic imagery, <em>phallic imagery</em>,
and <em>then</em> there’s the work of H.R. Giger—and still they sit there
staring at your Freudian hammer in a World of Nails.&#0160; You inform them
that the lips of the alien were constructed from <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=4ecFu4B_CpoC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;ots=m0mCKTtAB9&amp;dq">six stretched and shredded condoms smeared with KY jelly</a> while they quietly compose comments for Rate My Professor about how everything in your course is about sex.&#0160; 
</p>
<p>
“Not <em>everything</em>,” you insist.&#0160; “But I mean, come on now, <em>clearly this alien is</em>.&#0160; It is a giant penis, and within it is another penis, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=4ecFu4B_CpoC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;ots=m0mCKTtAB9&amp;dq#PPA6,M1">a penis <em>within a penis</em></a>, and in this panel Batman is firmly gripping that inner penis—”
</p>

<p>
And you stop because no matter what you say, professors who open
semesters with images of Batman giving an alien a hand job get comments
on Rate My Professor about how everything in their course is about
sex.*&#0160; </p><p>But it doesn’t have to end like this—there <em>is</em> a better
way.&#0160; With the help of erstwhile commenter Luther Blissett, I’ve
designed an introduction to visual rhetoric assignment that forces
students to understand that all comic and film images are obscenely
overdetermined.&#0160; On the first day of class, I’ll present them with Alan
Moore’s script for the eighth panel on the first page of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401216676/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Killing Joke</em></a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT THE POLICE CAR SIDE-ON SO THAT WE
SEE THE UNIFORMED OFFICER STANDING FACE-ON TO US OVER ON THE LEFT AS HE
STANDS WITH HIS BACK TO THE CAR AND COMMISSIONER GORDON FACE-ON OVER TO
THE RIGHT, LEANING AGAINST THE CAR AND DRNKING HIS STEAMING COFFEE,
MAYBE LOOKING UP WITH A QUIZZICAL AND CONCERNED LOOK OVER THE RIM OF
HIS CUP TOWARDS THE EXTREME LEFT OF THE FOREGROUND, WHERE WE CAN SEE
THE BATMAN ENTERING THE PICTURE FROM THE LEFT, IN PROFILE. SINCE BATMAN
IS (a) CLOSER TO US AND (b) TALLER THAN EITHER THE COMMISSIONER OR THE
PATROLMAN IN THE BACKGROUND WE CANNOT SEE THE TOP OF HIS HEAD HERE
ABOVE THE BOTTOM OF THE NOSE AS THE FRONT OF HIM ENTERS THE PANEL ON
THE LEFT. HIS EYES AND UPPER HEAD ARE INVISIBLE BEYOND THE TOP PANEL
BORDER AND ALL WE CAN REALLY SEE IS HIS MOUTH, WITH THE BIG AND
DETERMINED SQUARE JAW AND THE GRIM AND DISAPPROVING SCOWL OF THE LIPS.
THE BATMAN DOES NOT APPEAR FROM HIS POSTURE TO SO MUCH AS GLANCE AT
EITHER GORDON OR THE PATROLMAN AS HE WALKS PAST THEM EVEN THOUGH BOTH
OF THEM STEAL GLANCES AT HIM WITH DIFFERING LOOKS OF UNEASE. THE
PATROLMAN LOOKS UNEASY JUST TO BE IN THE BATMAN’S PRESENCE, WHILE
GORDON LOOKS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE BATMAN’S POSSIBLE STATE OF MIND.
RAIN DRIPS FROM EVERYTHING, INCLUDING THE BATMAN’S JUTTING AND GRIZZLED
CHIN. GORDON GIVES THE LARGELY-OFF-PANEL VIGILANTE A PENETRATING LOOK
OVER HIS COFFEE CUP, AND THE BLUE LIGHT ATOP THE CAR WASHES OVER ALL OF
THEM AS IT CIRCLES.
</p>
<p>
No Dialogue.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Then I’ll ask them to draw it.&#0160; After assuring them that I did indeed say <em>draw it</em>,
I’ll let them have about ten minutes to transform Moore’s prose into
stick-figure theater before showing them how Brian Bolland interpreted
it:
</p>
<p>
</p><center><img alt="image" border="0" name="image" src="http://www.thevalve.org/uploads/bolland1.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 390px;" /></center>

<p>Discussion will ensue.&#0160; I’ll show them the scripts to other
panels—ask them why, for example, Moore insisted the receptionist at
Arkham Asylum be reading Graham Greene’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140184945/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Comedians</em></a>—and
if all goes well, I won’t spend the next few months reading essays
about how in this panel Alan Moore wanted Batman to punch someone in
the face so he told Brian Bolland to draw a picture of Batman punching
someone in the face.&#0160; </p><p>(<em><a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the_overdetermined_image/">x-posted</a>.</em>)</p>
<p>
</p><hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia;">*Or not.&#0160; A proper interpretation of that image—one that factors in feminist interpretations of the alien as a species which rapes its prey to death—leads down paths too disturbing to tackle the first day of class. </span></p>

<p>And now I shall go away and mentally compose an essay for Dr Kaufmann, who (I understand from Rate Your Professor is, like, <i>obsessed</i> with sex) on that last <i>Killing Joke</i> panel, there.  About how the Commissioner&#39;s coffee cup is made to look like a pig&#39;s snout on his face to imply he is a sexist pig who likes have piggy sexist sex.  And about how the policeman&#39;s expression is slightly startled because he&#39;s looking at the cum dripping, like, <i>urgh</i>, off Batman&#39;s chin.</p>

<p>Do I pass the course?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-144207418-content"><p><em>Do I pass the course?</em></p>

<p>No, with thunder . . . but only because you neglected to mention Batman&#39;s clenched jaw, which is vital to understanding how disgusted he is with his treatment, nay, <em>presence</em> in <em>Superman and Batman vs. Aliens and Predator</em>.</p>

<p><em>So where are you trying to get your students to go in the end? I mean, what point are you leading up to once (if?) you get them to agree that everything in visual texts is overdetermined? That they should read differently? </em></p>

<p>With this particular exercise, I&#39;m simply trying to get them to see that visual rhetoric is meaningful, which---to my eternal dismay---they seem reluctant to do.  There&#39;s something odd to their reluctance though, because they&#39;ll admit that ads manipulate and directors structure scenes to a particular end, but they stop there.  Ideally, this exercise will force them to confront the constructedness of the image by showing them the parts the authors want combined into wholes.  We&#39;ll see.  (I <em>think</em> it&#39;ll work, but then again, I always do and it hardly ever does.)</p>

<p><em>Honestly, I thought Scott was going to go for the cum-dripping thing, too.</em></p>

<p>What do you think my footnote was for?  Seriously, there&#39;s something incredibly disturbing about that image when you think about it in feminist terms---not only does Batman avoid being raped-to-death by grabbing the alien by its cock-within-a-cock, its cock-within-a-cock has a <em>vagina dentata</em> at its tip; moreover, the alien either gets off on the thought of raping Batman&#39;s head to death it cums prematurely <em>or</em> it so gets off on being grabbed by such a manly hand it . . . as I said, I don&#39;t like the implications, hence the footnote.</p>

<p><em>I suspect that part of what makes it hard is that they are used to looking for hidden clues (suspense movies, and all that) but not for images that add meaning without advancing the plot. </em></p>

<p>They&#39;re entirely up to the task of identifying what the hidden stuff means, that is, they&#39;ll venture that the monster around the corner is a symbol of the lead character&#39;s childhood trauma; but for the life of them, they can&#39;t tell you how the director builds suspense by placing the symbol of the lead character&#39;s childhood trauma around the corner and shooting the scene from said character&#39;s perspective and amping up the strings ever so slightly as said character nears aforementioned corner, &amp;c.  </p>

<p>They can&#39;t do the nuts and bolts, so much so that last quarter when I tried to get them to discuss the first scene in <em>Batman Begins</em> in which we see Batman---the one where we don&#39;t, as he&#39;s flitting around like a classic horror monster, until he announces his arrival---they can&#39;t discern that Nolan shot that scene like a horror director would.  </p>

<p><em>Funny, for a brief, shining moment, I considered taking this seriously. Thanks for pulling me back, Scott.</em></p>

<p>Always take Joe seriously.  I mean that.  He&#39;s leagues smarter than 99.99 percent of everyone I&#39;ve ever met.</p></span>

<p>So are you pushing them toward a craft-oriented view of the text or more like a reading of the unconscious of the author and/or the surrounding culture itself?</p>

<p>And while those drawings definitely have a jizz resemblance, in the <a href="http://brocknroll.wordpress.com/2008/07/07/report-sigourney-weaver-is-game-for-another-alien/" rel="nofollow">movies</a> it is clearly supposed to be vaginal fluid, to go along with all the &quot;mother&quot; references.</p>

<p>And no one has said anything about the significance of the &quot;NO!&quot; in the top panel yet.</p>

<p>This is fun. You ought to have more posts about how your teaching is not all about sex around here. Maybe those students picked your office because they, somehow, <i>knew.</i></p></span>

I&#39;m late as usual (umm, I missed my bus because I was up all night being sick and taking care of a friend whose grandmother is in the hospital and I&#39;ll get you that paper really soon, I&#39;ve been working on it honestly, and can you waive the penalties for turning in stuff late since I&#39;m, like, really sincerely?), but quick question - what do you make of the alien(s) being vicious rapist females bent on reproducing regardless of their &#39;partners&#39; wishes (depositing fertilized eggs into their prey etc)? That seems significant to me. <br />

I know that sounds backwards—what with MOVIES! being PRESENTED! on SCREENS! the SIZE! of WYOMING!—but the compounded facts of run time and the modern American attention span necessitate we consider film the proper realm of the self-contained episode. Even films which promise sequels announce their completion in terms of whatever -ology they embrace. Films should be about something in the original, locative sense of the word. They should surround some subject matter, be &quot;on every side&quot; &quot;wholly or partially,&quot; as per the OED. They should be self-contained. Not that they shouldn't be sweeping—you can frame Guernica or a sublimely panoramic view of the Hudson River and slap it on a gallery wall without robbing them of sweep—but they should recognize their formal limitations. Films can only intimate narrative epicness. They can't achieve it. &quot;But!&quot; &quot;But But But!&quot; Try me. Start listing epic films and I'll start listing films with grandiose tableaux. The Lord of the Rings? Shot in that sewer of New Zealand. Blade Runner? The Lord himself envies Ridley Scott's matte painters. With film we confuse the formal qualities of narrative epic for the GIANT! SCALE! presented by the movie screen. Cases in point: Iron Man and The Dark Knight. Both were hailed as epic upon release, and yet both are far superior films on the small screen. Before you ask: I do remember what I wrote about The Dark Knight on IMAX, and inasmuch as it relates the experience of watching an obscenely high-quality image projected on the side of an eight-story building, I stand by it. Watching the film on a small screen—one on which a bug of a Batman glides between five-inch tall skyscrapers while Heath Ledger's Joker licks human-sized lips and establishes human-sized eye-contact—it's impossible to deny that this supposedly epic performance is better suited to the televisual medium. (This goes doubly for Iron Man, which barely passes for &quot;good&quot; on the big screen but shines when we connect with Robert Downey Jr. as a human actor in corporate world.) Not that I think we should deny that the serial drama is also better served on the small screen. A solidly written, solidly acted television show can be a better film than most films. To wit: having finished the first four episodes of the blogosphere's own Leverage, I can't help but wonder what went so terribly wrong with Ocean's Twelve and Thirteen.

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/i-only-investigated-this-report-online.html"><span><strong>I only investigated this report online.</strong> Michelle Malkin’s vaunted list of “investigative online reporting published on conservative blogs” demonstrates, for the umpteenth time, that Michelle Malkin can’t tell the difference between reporters and partisan political operatives. She opens the list reportly enough—Patterico’s posts on William Jefferson, Alex Kozinski and Chuck Philips are, in fact, works of investigative journalism—but after that you have: a hit-piece on Air America a hit-piece on Al Franken an unpublished hit-piece by Larry Grathwohl that Confederate Yankee posted because neither knew the New York Times doesn’t print op-ed rebuttals something or other in which someone talks about attending political rallies a hit-piece on Ayers in which one “Zombie” did a Lexis-Nexis search numerous failed hit-pieces by Charles Johnson—representative—about trolls on Obama’s community blogs a hit-piece on Jeremiah Wright a hit-piece on Obama Jr. via Obama Sr. numerous hit-pieces by Stanley Kurtz—representative—on Obama numerous hit-pieces on Obama for his “abortion extremism” in which his public voting record and campaign statements were “reported on” some “top notch investigative work” that links to back to Malkin’s post some video hit-pieces on YouTube that rebroadcast Obama’s never-before-heard and never-anywhere-seen statements about “redistributing wealth” a Google search for Ed Morrissey at Hot Air that “brought down [Canada's] liberal government in 2005 a whole slew of hit-pieces written by Malkin herself which I won’t bother to link to My point? Doing a Lexis-Nexis search is not investigative reporting. Reprinting material from social networking sites is not investigative reporting. Rebroadcasting clips that every network—including Foxnews—had in heavy rotation for weeks on end is not investigative reporting. Attacking people with whom a Presidential candidate had some contact is not investigative reporting. While it’s possible for partisan hacks like Malkin to do investigative reporting, little of what she presents as investigative reporting is investigative reporting. The majority of her links are to undisguised attacks by unpaid political operatives, and—say it with me now—an undisguised attack by an unpaid political operative is not investigative reporting.
