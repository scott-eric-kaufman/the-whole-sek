			<p>In his 1985 <em>Social Text </em>article &quot;<a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0164-2472%28198523%290%3A12%3C94%3AHATC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-1">History and the Canon</a>,&quot; Paul Lauter writes the following sentence:</p><blockquote><p>The search of the social movements for <em>a</em> <em>useable past</em> led out this closed [canonical] circle.

<p>Undermining white patriarchal privilege?&nbsp; An unmitigated good.</p>

<p>Why?&nbsp; Because undue attention on particular particulars skews the record.&nbsp; I want to know what happened, not what happened to popular pricks whose girlfriends and &quot;girlfriends&quot; were on the yearbook staff.&nbsp; That sort of selective memory compels tears from my eyes and small angry flecks of spittle from the corners of my mouth.&nbsp; I hate it.&nbsp; What many literary scholars fail to realize is that the sin is the sin no matter who commits it.&nbsp; To move to a central locale some work of marginal literature is to strip said work of its unique engagement with the majoritarian culture.&nbsp; Perhaps that work attempts, <a href="http://www.english.uiuc.edu/MAPS/poets/s_z/tolson/libretto.htm">Tolson</a>-style, to outwit Eliot at his own game.&nbsp; Or perhaps the work attempts, <a href="http://www.english.uiuc.edu/MAPS/poets/s_z/toomer/toomer.htm">Toomer</a>-style, to recast the marginal as central on its own terms.&nbsp; </p>

<p>To segregate a tradition from its context in order to establish its gendered or racial or ethnic uniqueness is to refuse to hear its protestation for fear it'll be considered protestant.&nbsp; <em>Protestant</em>.&nbsp; The irony menaces like thick chunks of corrosive fog.&nbsp; I understand the impulse to create a tradition separate from that of your adversary.&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; I don't understand massaging it into some useful form for some contemporary struggle.&nbsp; That elevates the needs of the now above the sacrifices of the then.&nbsp; And it bothers me.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Current you-never-saw-this-coming-type example?&nbsp; Feminist evaluations of S.W. Mitchell and &quot;The Rest Cure.&quot;&nbsp; Is it malice or ignorance which drove scholars to ignore his incredible string of successes among women of extraordinary intelligence so that they might pillory him as the embodiment of paternalistic condescension?&nbsp; Does it matter?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I'm no defender of Mitchell—the chapter whose slave I currently am does the man's reputation no favors—but I do balk at condemnations of his life and work on the basis of his misdiagnosis of Charlotte Perkins Gilman.&nbsp; Did he punt it?&nbsp; You need not even ask.&nbsp; Did he punt every woman he treated and is he therefore the epitome of all that is vile and patriarchal in nineteenth-century American culture?&nbsp; Nope.</p>

<p>&quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; may, as Paula A. Treichler <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0732-7730%28198421%2F23%293%3A1%2F2%3C61%3AETSDAD%3E2.0.CO%3B2-1">argues</a>, enact &quot;a clash between diagnosis and women's discourse,&quot; and Mitchell may play the worse for the performance.&nbsp; But must Treichler have taken Gilman's word for it?&nbsp; Could she not have looked at accounts written by his other female patients before determining that Mitchell imposed his &quot;No Reading No Writing&quot; policy on all his female patients.&nbsp;  [<em>parenthetical deleted. thanks Lauren!</em>]&nbsp; He didn't.&nbsp; Only on those whose symptoms led him to believe that they suffered from overstimulation.&nbsp; Some of his female patients, including Owen Wister's exhausted sister Sarah, were prescribed the very activities Mitchell barred Gilman from doing.&nbsp; I grant that the charge of paternalism still sticks—but only in the way it would to any medical professional you hire.&nbsp; Mitchell's treatment of Gilman was the product of his paying particular attention to her complaints and advocating a treatment tailored to her as an individual.</p>

<p>I understand that Gilman didn't recognize this.&nbsp; But how is it that prior to 2005 published scholars hadn't either?&nbsp; I wager that Mitchell was too juicy a foil to relinquish, that the story is too wonderfully useful to abandon in favor of one complete and accurate. </p>

<p>All this when his actual sins are so representative and plentiful.&nbsp; If we dismiss him as a simple sexist we'll never see him in all his imperialistic and heteronormative glory.&nbsp; We'll never see the budding eugenicist and aristocratic dupe for who he is.&nbsp; We'll only know him as Gilman's foil.&nbsp; &nbsp;He was so much more . . . or less.<br /> </p>

		<span id="comment-16314994-content"><p>This was such a good post.</p>

<p>I took a random &quot;Women Novelists&quot; class with Anne Van Sant and she assigned &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot;--so for once, I know exactly what you&#39;re talking about. Although I never heard of S.W. Mitchell before you introduced me to him. But I remember well our discussions of &quot;the rest cure.&quot; Do I sound stupid for being so happy that I understood something non-law related so clearly for the first time in a long time?  It&#39;s hard to describe what it&#39;s like to be taken back to Winter Quarter of your senior year, four years ago. When writing essays was your thing. When you read more fiction than non-fiction. Ahhh, to be an English major again.</p>

<p>But going back to your post, I agree with your assessment of historical revisionists and their ilk. I&#39;ve had the same disagreements with those who practice it in my own field of Critical Race Theory. But then you realize that you&#39;re just one kind of &quot;big picture&quot; person shouting down another who thinks they&#39;re the &quot;bigger picture of the entire history of colonialism, racism, and white hegemony&quot; person. The shouting match (which often occurs silently in your head) is an important dialogue too. This is why I am a closeted (and selective, per opinion) fan of the jurisprudence of Oliver Wendell Holmes and Justice Harlan I. It&#39;s hard to publicly like someone who was a eugencist and another who said that &quot;there is one race so foreign--I speak of the Chinese&quot; at the same time he said that Blacks should be equal to Whites. I mean, these are but a few cases in a hundred. But I would defend my opinions, as you do. But sometimes, I prefer the shouting matches to be silent debates, since each side is so intractable. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-16349981-content"><p>I find this approach to history really distressing, as well.  One corrollary to it, which I seem to have run into a bit in seeking out supervision, is the perverse belief that, if you are seriously studying a person or a phenomenon, paying enough time and attention to try to really understand something, then it must be because you *like* what you are studying.  I was in a situation at one point where multiple potential supervisors, who were quite happy to work with me on some other project, recused themselves when I tried to propose a project on a particular far-right social movement.  The point of the project, to me, was that we need to study the self-understanding and &quot;social logic&quot; of movements, if we&#39;re seriously concerned about their potential influence; their point was that they couldn&#39;t supervise something that would require them to pay close attention to something they detested...  I ultimately had to abandon the project for lack of supervision...</p>

<p>My current research generally doesn&#39;t touch on such emotive issues, but I&#39;m still struck by a lower-level corrollary of the same phenomenon:  the tendency of some researchers to cite only a mutually-reinforcing network of people with closely-affiliated views, when there is a different (also mutually-reinforcing) network of people researching the same phenomenon, and coming to very different conclusions.  </p>

<p>This often can happen in a completely unintentional way, of course - someone in physics just won&#39;t know that a social scientist is actually interested in the same phenomenon, etc.  That&#39;s unfortunate, but forgiveable.  More disturbing is when the networks are aware of one another on some level, but just refuse to engage - each one, for example, pointing to how the other has been funded, or to political affiliations, or some other relativising factor.  I find this method of discouting others&#39; research deeply disturbing - sure, be aware of someone&#39;s potential bias, and arm yourself with the knowledge that you may need to be particularly attentive to the evidence adduced for specific types of claims.  But at least provide a substantive critique:  indicate what&#39;s wrong with the methodology, the evidence, the conclusions - and what&#39;s wrong with these things needs to be more than that we aren&#39;t happy with the political implications...</p></span>

Another Dissertation Chapter Finished</strong> Oops. That should read &quot;I Didn't Finish Another Dissertation Chapter Tonight!&quot; [Edited to remove ambiguity.] So no new post tonight. I feel like I've let the blog down. Like I'm the reprobate of the blog community. Like I've been jackbooted by this adorable monstrosity. (It's real . . . and it's fantastic.) So in lieu of new content I share this: Someone emailed a graduate student listserv I subscribe to with a link to something dissertating graduate students would love. I thought that since I've been having difficulty dissertating, I'd like a little comic relief in the form of something dissertating graduate students would love. So I clicked on the link: http://tinyurl.com/k229y Can I communicate in words how &quot;much&quot; that helped me out? Really. Then again, who better to commiserate with?</span></a></div>

You know the ones: You're walking home from class, grousing under your breath about the &quot;progress&quot; you made on your dissertation yesterday, then suddenly something clicks when you think you hear Karen O screaming something which sounds surprisingly like &quot;ZORK!&quot; Tonight's random confluence comes from a click &quot;overhead&quot; as I read Amardeep's post. I had been thinking about how to reply to Belle Lettre and N. Pepperell's comments on something I wrote in an exaggerated fit of annoyance about the idea of &quot;a useable past.&quot; The unacknowledged cherry atop my conceptual complaint had been the feather-fluffing prose in which these historical distortions declaimed. I thought I'd write a sarcastic &quot;Note to Self&quot; about new regulations limiting the number of unchecked facts OSHA allows one to balance simultaneously on a soap box. I'd outline the regulations in bureaucratic detail and lull the majority of my audience into a stupor . . . so I ranted instead. As my prosopalgic complaints accumulated my prosodic ones dropped from sight. All conceptual headache and no complaints about rhetoric! What was I thinking? This. Such were the thoughts my mind's eye lazily half-scanned as I read Amardeep's post after a day of relentless dissertating . . . then it clicked. Endless thought about the Origin of Species had organized an opinion on academic jargon with little or no intervention from my preoccupied mind! To Be Continued . . .</span></a></div>
