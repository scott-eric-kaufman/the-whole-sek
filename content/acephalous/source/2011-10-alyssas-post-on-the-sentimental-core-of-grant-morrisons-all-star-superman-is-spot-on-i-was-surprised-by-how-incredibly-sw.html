        <meta name="description" content="Alyssa's post on the sentimental core of Grant Morrison's All-Star Superman is spot on: I was surprised by how incredibly sweet the comic is. I wasn’t really expecting that. The basic premise, for those not in the know, is Lex Luthor finds a way to essentially give Superman fast-developing cancer, leaving Superman to do a lot of bucket-list things: give Lois Lane the chance to experience his powers for the day; nail one last scoop for the Daily Planet; go back and visit the grave of Jonathan Kent, his adopted father; save the world one last time. However, the hallmarks of Morrison's work, according to renowned comic scholar (and Alyssa's occasional interlocutor) Douglas Wolk, are: reality-bending metaphysical freakouts dressed up in action-adventure drag; metaphors that make visible the process by which language creates an image that in turn becomes narrative; a touch of feel-good self-improvement rhetoric; faith in the the power of pop and popularity to do magic; and skinny bald men who are stand-ins for Morrison himself, heroically conquering sadness and making the world evolve. (Reading Comics 258) If those two descriptions seem at odds, that's because they are. Morrison is a talented but unintegrated artist. What do I mean? He can be as aggressively annoying as Wolk's flattering account of him suggests. Incorporating proxies of himself into narratives about the nature of narratives and claiming that magic makes these metaphorical selves visible? That is, to quote my advisor, pure &quot;postmodern gee-whiz wankery.&quot; It's cleverness for the sake of being hailed as King Clever, and it grates on my every last nerve because it's so clinical and intellectualized. AND YET. I came to graduate school to study the works of James Joyce, whose complex wankery far outstrips anything Morrison's attempted, much less accomplished. So why does Morrison bother me in a manner Joyce doesn't? The short answer is that, at his best, Morrison doesn't bother me at all. When is he at his best? As Alyssa notes, it's when he's stripped a story to its emotional core and presented its complexities not as worthy subjects in and of themselves, but as natural consequences of a human narrative. Of course, the protagonists of these &quot;human&quot; narratives are rarely human: in All-Star Superman, it's Superman; in We3, it's a trio of weaponized house-pets. That is to say: Morrison seems to have a problem elevating actual humans to a position worthy of simple human sympathy. A kidnapped pet or an orphaned alien are worthy of sympathy because they aspire to be more than their outsider status allows them to be. But an average human being? He or she is what he or she is—short of a magical authorial intervention that's as likely to land him or her in Sade's castle as provide anything resembling hope or help. The only transcendence average people can acquire is by proxy, e.g. Lois's &quot;acquisition&quot; of Superman's powers on her birthday.

<p>If those two descriptions seem at odds, that&#39;s because they are. Morrison is a talented but unintegrated artist. What do I mean? He can be as aggressively annoying as Wolk&#39;s flattering account of him suggests. Incorporating proxies of himself into narratives about the nature of narratives and claiming that magic makes these metaphorical selves visible?

<p>AND YET.</p>
<p>I came to graduate school to study the works of James Joyce, whose complex wankery far outstrips anything Morrison&#39;s attempted, much less accomplished. So why does Morrison bother me in a manner Joyce doesn&#39;t? The short answer is that, at his best, Morrison doesn&#39;t bother me at all. When is he at his best? As Alyssa notes, it&#39;s when he&#39;s stripped a story to its emotional core and presented its complexities not as worthy subjects in and of themselves, but as natural consequences of a human narrative. Of course, the protagonists of these &quot;human&quot; narratives are rarely human: in <em>All-Star Superman,&#0160;</em>it&#39;s Superman; in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401230679/diesekoschmar-20" target="_self">We3</a></em>, it&#39;s a trio of weaponized house-pets.</p>
<p>That is to say: Morrison seems to have a problem elevating actual humans to a position worthy of simple human sympathy.

The only transcendence average people can acquire is by proxy,&#0160;<em>e.g.&#0160;</em>Lois&#39;s &quot;acquisition&quot; of Superman&#39;s powers on her birthday.</p>
<p>In short, I don&#39;t find in Morrison much in the way of human sympathy for ordinary humans. This is where—their shared love of verbal and narrative pyrotechnics aside—I find Morrison lacking what Joyce possessed in abundance: because behind the modernist wankery that is <em>Ulysses&#0160;</em><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/06/today-in-1904.html" target="_self">is a simple story about a man dealing (poorly) with a crisis he knew was coming but couldn&#39;t avert</a>. It&#39;s a powerful story because of its fundamental humanity, not, as would be the case with Morrison, despite it.</p>

<p>(KYB tends to get overlooked in these discussions because it&#39;s very early work, and has fallen OOP.  It&#39;s 20something Morrison just coming out of his punk phase, telling a rambling picaresque story of alienation and violence.  But it leads directly to his later stuff; those two kids are totally candidate-recruits for the Invisibles.)</p>

I love The Sopranos. Deadwood, which didn't last long, was a series I liked a lot; it had more filthy language than I've ever heard on television anywhere in my life, but it was brilliantly written. I like some of what is on now, like Breaking Bad and Dexter. Ever since then, his Twitter feed's been mighty entertaining. In particular, he implicitly claims that The Wire is &quot;just a police series&quot; but Entourage is something more. (I'm not sure exactly what that something is, but it must have to do with the fact that, as a celebrity himself, he could relate to the Vince and his crew on a profound level inaccessible to those of us who found the show and its characters vapid and humorless.) Rushdie's dismissal of The Wire as &quot;mere&quot; genre fiction couldn't be more poorly timed, coming as it does on the tail end of Colson Whitehead's dismissal of genre fiction as an operative category in contemporary literature. Genre only matters, Whitehead argues, to people incapable of seeing past it. One would assume that a magic realist like Rushdie would understand that. But no. He'll watch Game of Thrones, but only because it qualifies as research: I watched all that because if I am going to work in this field, I need to know what it is going on. I have been making myself have whole-series marathons to get the point of how it goes. I will soon start writing my little series. What's his &quot;little series&quot; about? It's a sort of paranoid science-fiction series, people disappearing and being replaced by other people. Sounds like just another science fiction series to me.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/10/holy-terror-frank-miller-my-how-far-youve-fallen.html"><span><strong>Holy Terror, Frank Miller!</strong> In 2006, Frank Miller announced a forthcoming publication called Holy Terror, Batman! in which the Dark Knight would go to Afghanistan and get in a fistfight with Osama bin Laden. He claimed it would hark back to an earlier era in comics history when, for example, Superman would marshal his many powers to annoy Hitler: All well and good, except DC didn't think the Batman brand would be enhanced by being aggressively associated with the worst elements of the Bush administration, and so the world was spared Holy Terror, Batman! Until a few weeks ago, that is, when Miller published Holy Terror, a book about a Batman-type vigilante who teams with a Catwoman-type thief and a Commissioner Gordon-type chief to defeat a series of terrorist attacks against a Gotham-type Empire City. (Miller's roman à clef is so obvious I believe DC might be able to sue for copyright infringement.) Let me begin by warning you: This book is more terrible than I'm leading you to believe it is. It's Batman as written by Pam Geller after she and Glenn Reynolds split a box of wine. Only worse. Where the art isn't muddled it's obscured by a dense bank of unnecessary Eisner spritz. Human proportions—especially female proportions—remind anyone who may've forgotten of his directions to Jim Lee on All-Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder: If you thought his sexism was shameless, you should see his xenophobia: At least he acknowledges that Muslims belong to the human race. Generally speaking, that is, because it's not like he can tell them apart: So these terrorists, all of whom are named Mohammed, are attacking Empire City because it stands as a shining beacon of democracy and freedom. Which means, as we all learned during the early years of the War on Terror, that we're &quot;down with&quot; torture: As well we should be, after all, because we're fighting a new enemy now and have no choice but to engage in &quot;postmodern diplomacy&quot;: It seems strange for Miller to play jihad for a joke when he obviously believes it necessitates his adolescent diplomatic fantasy, but that's just another symptom of his declining mind. Consider this: the man who wrote and pencilled The Dark Knight Returns in 1986 decides to write and pencil another book about another Batman-type figure going to war against an invading army of blinkered idiots, only in 2006, he lacks the imagination required to have this Batman-type figure fend them off with anything short of an arsenal. What would Batman say to that? Moreover, what would Batman do with a horde of poor kids whose misdirected aggression has left them vulnerable to persuasion by a radical ideology? He would provide an alternative: Before you ask: that is Batman, on a horse, leading until-very-recently mindless terror-proxies in an attempt to save Gotham. Frank Miller in 1986 believed that the enemy wasn't only human, but capable of being redeemed; his 2006 counterpart, however, is having none of it. After all, 9/11 Q.E.D.</span></a></div>
