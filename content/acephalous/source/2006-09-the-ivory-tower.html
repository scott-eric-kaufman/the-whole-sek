		<span id="comment-22606812-content"><p>With regard to the whole Althouse thing, Timothy Burke is basically right -- not that you&#39;re a preternatural anus, but because there are some arguments that it&#39;s best not to even bother with.  In particular, it makes no sense these days to have any kind of argument across the liberal-conservative divide.  Liberals can argue with libertarians to their right and socialists to their left, if they want to indulge themselves in inconsequential argument.  But conservatives don&#39;t argue.  They are basically irrational, and can only be fought.</p></span>

The problem with dealing with figures on the cusp of medicine&#39;s professionalization is that they like to intersperse their medical papers with theories of intentionality in literature and etiology.  It&#39;s unfortunate, but at least it provides me some ancillary entertainment.</p>

<p>Bill, I wish I could say I <i>knew</i> the reference you I was going for ... but I&#39;ve <i>quite a bit</i> of work to do before I can call myself a C19th Americanist and not feel like a fake.</p>

<p>Rich, yes, I realize that.  Being called, albeit indirectly, a &quot;tool&quot; by Timothy made me reevaluate my life&#39;s work.  I stewed all day, and all of the night ... until I realized that there&#39;s a time for nuance, and then there isn&#39;t.  I mistook the latter for the former.  That said, I <i>still</i> believe I can communicate with intelligent conservatives (and that such beasts exist), and for the time being, I&#39;ll take Timothy and Michael&#39;s examples to heart ...</p>

<p>ben, I could email you a copy of the article, but that&#39;d just ruin the joke ...</p></span>

Those who can't do, teach. Those who can't teach, well, they agree to guest post on conservative blogs. (About liberals in academia, no less.) Why? Because writing for a hostile audience—or, more accurately, writing for an audience you assume will be hostile—closely resembles walking into a classroom and informing students they'll be re-reading Huck Finn. Speaking of which, that's one of the topics I'll be addressing while there. Re-reading Huck Finn, that is. Why? Some fool devotes a chapter to it in his new book ... [Since PW's servers can't parse liberal guests posts, I've included the text of mine below the fold.] Pot, Kettle, Black and All That [Scott a.k.a. “The Token Lefty&quot;] For some reason, Jeff thought having me blog here wouldn’t be a terrible idea. I hope to make him rue that decision. Not rue rue, mind you, just a little. I’ll be concentrating my posts on two books which deal with multiculturalism in contemporary academia and American society. Each is brilliant in its own way, and each deserves a fair hearing. The first is Michael Bérubé‘s What’s Liberal about the Liberal Arts?; the second, Walter Benn Michaels’ The Trouble with Diversity. Who am I? My name’s Scott. Want to know more about me? Read my greatest hits. That said, I composed something which has absolutely nothing to do with either book this afternoon. You see, I thought it’d be nice to introduce myself via a rational examination of a clearly irrational argument. Looks like I was wrong: So you’ve all seen the infamous photo, right? If not, click on it. Finished? What did you see? I saw an awkward group portrait. Not nearly so graceful as, say, this one. Or this one. Or this one, either. It’s almost as if the photo Ann Althouse considers evidence of feminism’s death wasn’t a carefully orchestrated moment captured by a professional photographer to commemorate the happiest moment in a young couple’s life, but a hastily assembled photo op in which a bunch of amateur photographers told him to stand over there, yes, and her to, no, no, not there, in the first row, now, yes, over there, look here, thanks. Click. Click click. Click click click click click. This confusion, well, it confuses Althouse. To wit: I’m judging you [Jessica] by your apparent behavior. It’s not about the smiling, but the three-quarter pose and related posturing, the sort of thing people razz Katherine Harris about. I really don’t know why people who care about feminism don’t have any edge against Clinton for the harm he did to the cause of taking sexual harrassment seriously, and posing in front of him like that irks me, as a feminist. That second point? Beyond reproach. Feminists can and do have reservations about sharing a conference table with someone with Clinton’s reputation. But the first one? Remember all the sluts in the wedding photos? The ones who stood up straight, turned a little to their left or right...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/09/silas_weir_blah.html"><span><strong>Silas Weir Blah Blah Blah: Read the Post, Please, It's Actually Not Insular and Terrible</strong> So this Silas Weir Mitchell fellow I'm working on, he was a doctor first, a herpetologist second, and a novelist a distant, distant third. In addition to &quot;the rest cure,&quot; for which he's unfairly but universally reviled, Mitchell's also known as a pioneer in the treatment of snake bites. As he wrote in his (unpublished) autobiography: At one time my scientific work was in the direction of comparative physiology among reptilians, and later, again and again, of researches on the poison of serpents; these were the foundation for more modern studies of toxic albumen. (74) An amateur herpetologist specializing in the chemical composition of venoms, Mitchell collected poisonous snakes. When he heard from the future U.S. Surgeon General, William Hammond, that &quot;he had used with success an antidote for snake poison known as Bibron's&quot; (after the famous French doctor), he considered himself lucky that &quot;just at this time a man offered to sell [him] a half dozen rattlesnakes&quot; (75). Bibron, it turns out, had never heard of his namesake antidote, and so, unsurprisngly, Mitchell's experiments with it failed. Still, Mitchell had a laboratory brimming over with rattlesnakes and a deep desire to study the components of their hemotoxic venom. His father and friends thought this could hurt his medical practice: The late Professor Henry Smith said to me, &quot;What nonsense to bother yourself about snake poisons!&quot; And a larger man, Professor Samuel Jackson, warned me that every experiment in the laboratory would lose me a patient. (72) Not to belabor the obvious, but ... NOTE: Because friends and wives convinced me that no one'll actually believe my tale of Samuel Jackson admonishing Dr. Mitchell to get these blah blahing blahs out of his blah blahing blah, I've provided visual evidence of my honesty.</span></a></div>
