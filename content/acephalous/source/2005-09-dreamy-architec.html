So I'm off to &quot;NorCal&quot; in the morning. (I've been told that if I want to fit in I need to call it &quot;NorCal,&quot; but since SoCal's abbreviated &quot;SoCal,&quot; I'm not sure if I've been had or not. Probably.) I fully intend on enjoying this vacation. I'll be re-reading Michael Lewis' (of Moneyball fame) account of his years at Salomon Brothers, Liar's Poker, and following it up by being the last boy on the block to read Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrrell. (And yes, I'll also be re-reading Moneyball, because it's the best popular book about the numerous attempts to quantify human behavior and develop sophisticated predicative models based on said quantifications...and it's about the Oakland A's, who I may have an opportunity to see while I'm in &quot;NorCal.&quot;) One thing I won't be doing is visitng Jack London Square. &quot;Outstanding Shopping, Dining, and Entertainment&quot;? In Jack London Square? Soapboxes topped by socialists I'd understand. Spencerians screaming &quot;progress, Progress, PROGRESS&quot; wouldn't surprise. But &quot;Outstanding Shopping, Dining, and Entertainment&quot;? No thank you. Jack London State Historic Park, to the contrary, looks to embody his own contradictions instead of those of modern consumer capitalism. I find that more palatable and fully attend on visiting the charred remains of Wolf House (pictured on your immediate left). I may also visit the boulder under which he insisted he be buried. Such somber processions I can stomach at times like these. Visiting the birthplace of the Dead, on the other hand, turns it. I'll address many issues (and answer many questions) upon my return. But don't think that I won't be updating this here blog in every WiFi outfitted coffee shop from Irvine to Napa Valley. Because I will be. (And with all that time to think I'll answer intelligently many an important question, including the one asked by Cam, which if I weren't packing and/or avoiding thinking unpleasant thoughts about quarters beginning or Louisiana, I'd address immediately.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/tribble_redux_c.html"><span><strong>My Arcane Enological Chops; or, My Lies and Love of Industry</strong> Tribble Redux could've been the title of this post. But his bland &quot;restatement&quot; of points he didn't make the first time through has already been deflowered of its strained innocence by Miram, Collin Brooke, and gzombie. (No doubt others too, but since I'm working from a WiFi that can barely handle the graphics-heavy sites of the Wordherders, I'll leave the link-whoring to those better outfitted.) In its stead I offer this confession: I'm officially a &quot;wine enthusiast.&quot; Like Paul Giamatti in Sideways, only without the arcane enological chops and impressive command of all things adjectival (after today, however, I may be able to fake it). So while I could litter this entry with rows and rows of pictuces of rows and rows of grapes (whose roots, interestingly enough, are at this very moment straining to reach the water table, a process known as &quot;I don't remember.&quot; Or I could continue yesterday's discussion about my fascination with the results of haphazard building practices. But I'll spare you the first and continue the second only when I have something more interesting to say about it (as opposed to the numerous other examples I thought up today). Instead I'll talk about my frankly toddler-esque infatuation with machinery and pipes. It leads me to take pictures like the one you see up there on your left and right. There's something about the evidence of shiny process that assures me that the world isn't the unwieldy mess it appears to be. No! It's an orderly place populated by men in hardhats who work for its betterment. It is not the world described by Michael Lewis in Liar's Poker, in which traders spend far more time plotting strategy than...wondering whether the should do the deals. They basically assume that anything that enables them to get rich must also be good for the world. The embodiment of the take-over market is a high-strung, hyperambitious twenty-six-year-old, employed by a large American investment bank, smiling and dialing for companies. (222) That is not the world I live in. My world's connected by pipes. These pipes contain goods manufactured by honest men in hardhats. These goods are delivered to these pipes by means of ladders and walkways which reverberate under the feet of the heavy work-boots of honest hardhatted men. This is how my world works. This is how my world works. I photograph objects which evidence my illusions. I only thought through this theory today, and it's undoubtedly the product of coincidence: reading Liar's Poker while touring manufacturing plants indulging in my predilection for photographing industrial apparatuses. Evidence supporting this theory is thin on the ground. Thin in the trees. Thin in the air. Thin in the world. But all over this post.</span></a></div>
