Concentrate instead on how she castigates hypothetical parents who would take their children to an R-rated film. Who is her audience? Who does she imagine it is? I know, it’s being heavily marketed as a superhero movie, with action figures for your kids. I see now—her audience consists of people who never click on links. Because if they did, they’d see Schlussel links to a limited run of 5,000 figures designed for I-buy-Power-Girl-statuettes crowd. But what about the hypothetical children? Who will care for the hypothetical children? But then, we see cops looking over their naked, bloodied, dead bodies on a bed, with the words “LESBIAN WHORES,” written in blood on the wall.

An R-rated motion picture may include adult themes, adult activity, hard language, intense or persistent violence, sexually-oriented nudity, drug abuse or other elements, so that parents are counseled to take this rating very seriously. Children under 17 are not allowed to attend R-rated motion pictures unaccompanied by a parent or adult guardian. Parents are strongly urged to find out more about R-rated motion pictures in determining their suitability for their children.

<blockquote><p>If you take your kids to see “The Watchmen,” you’re a
moron. If you see it yourself, you’re also probably a moron and a
vapid, indecent human being.</p></blockquote>
<p>Set aside the fact that she punts the film’s title. Set aside the fact that she punts the film’s title <em>even though the poster is included in the post.</em>
Concentrate instead on how she castigates hypothetical parents who

<p>I see now—her audience consists of people who never click on links.
Because if they did, they’d see Schlussel links to a limited run of
5,000 figures designed for I-buy-<a href="http://www.superherotimes.com/news/images/WDCU.MiniBust.PowerGirl.jpg">Power-Girl-statuettes</a> crowd. But what about the hypothetical children? Who will care for the hypothetical children?</p>

young children with them to R-rated motion pictures.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you, <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/FlmRat_Ratings.asp">official Motion Picture Association of America</a> guidelines. Let’s compare rubric of the R-rating to Schlussel’s litany of offensive scenes in the film:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Schlussel:</strong> Two superheroes have an
explicit sex scene in a spaceship–she’s on top, then he’s on top,
awesome–you can teach your young kids multiple sexual positions before
they even reach puberty, by taking them to see this (there’s a less
explicit sex scene between the slutty superheroine and another
superhero not long before that).</p>
<p><strong>MPAA:</strong> . . . sexually-oriented nudity . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Situation normal.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Schlussel:</strong> Superhero “The Comedian” (a bad Robert Downey, Jr. look-alike) brutally beating and raping another superhero[.]</p>
<p><strong>MPAA:</strong> . . . adult themes . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Situation normal..</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Schlussel:</strong> [S]uperheroes hurling obscenities[.]</p>
<p><strong>MPAA:</strong> . . . hard language . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Situation normal.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Schlussel:</strong> A man’s hands and arms being
sawed off with an electric saw–we’re shown the bloody stumps and the
bloody sawed off limbs in close up shots[.]</p>
<p><strong>MPAA:</strong> . . . intense or persistent violence . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Seems Schlussel has been offended by the very elements the MPAA
guidelines predict will be in an R-rated film. Her whole argument,
then, is that some parents would be dumb enough to take young children
to a film that no one believes young children should see—and that only
Debbie Schlussel can save them from their own craven stupidity. That
can’t be right. She can’t possibly fashion herself Debbie Schlussel:
Defender of the Morbidly Obtuse. Or can she?</p><p>

<blockquote><p>THE THING IS THAT MOST PARENTS DON’T READ THE GRAPHIC NOVELS AND ARE UNAWARE THAT IT’S NOT REALLY A SUPERHERO MOVIE.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course she can. That she responds to criticism in ALL CAPS* means
we should rename her DEBBIE SCHLUSSEL: DEFENDER OF THE MORBIDLY OBTUSE.
But only some of them:</p>
<blockquote><p>UH, I DON’T NEED TO “DO MY HOMEWORK” WHEN I WATCH AND
CRITIQUE A MOVIE THAT’S SICKENING AND MARKETED AT KIDS. ALL I NEED TO
DO IS WATCH IT AND KEEP MY SANITY, WHICH ALL OF YOU WATCHMEN IDIOTS
APPARENTLY LONG AGO GAVE UP. NO, YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE INTELLIGENT TO
FULLY ENJOY IT. ON THE CONTRARY, AS YOU AND THE OTHER WATCHMEN IDIOTS
HAVE DEMONSTRATED, YOU HAVE TO BE A COMPLETE FLIPPING IDIOT WITH ZERO
INTELLECT AND SOUL. CALLING THIS STUPID STORYLINE A FANTASTIC PLOT JUST
SHOWS HOW SIMPLE AND EMPTY YOU ARE.</p></blockquote>
<p>Calm down now, Debbie. See? No more ALL CA—</p>
<blockquote><p>AND THANKS FOR EDUCATING ME THAT RAPE AND GRISLY
VIOLENCE IS HIGH CULTURE THAT I DON’T “GET.” GO TELL IT TO YOUR FRIENDS
AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE FILM CLASS OR G.E.D. SCHOOL. IT MIGHT FLY THERE.
FYI, MEIN KAMPF IS A VISION OF AN ALTERNATE WORLD. MAYBE WE SHOULD
WORSHIP THAT, TOO, AIRHEAD.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now look here, Deb—</p>
<blockquote><p>THANKS FOR EXPLAINING TO ME THE COMPLETELY IDIOTIC
REASONING BEHIND SUPPORTING AND MINDLESSLY DEFENDING THIS PIECE OF
CRAP. WE KNOW WHO THE IDIOT IS–THE GUY YOU SEE IN YOUR MIRROR. IF
SOMEONE RAPES YOUR MOTHER AND SLICES OFF YOUR LIMBS WITH AN ELECTRIC
SAW, I WON’T CARE, BECAUSE, AFTER ALL IT WAS IN A GRAPHIC NOVEL FIRST,
“YOU IDIOT.” SO WE SHOULD CELEBRATE THIS KIND OF THING. OH, AND I THINK
I’LL DONATE A CAPE AND MASK TO THE RAPIST/LIMB-CUTTER. BECAUSE, AFTER
ALL, WE MUST BREAK THE MOLD OF THE SUPERHERO AND CELEBRATE IT.
ANTI-CHOICE? SHE MADE THE CHOICE WHEN SHE HAD A KID. THIS IS CHILD
ABUSE, BUT HEY, IT WAS IN A GRAPHIC NOVEL AND BREAKS THE MOLD OF
SUPERHEROES.</p></blockquote>
<p>Could someone grab the thoraz—</p>
<blockquote><p>THE BACKGROUND EXCUSE. SO, IF THERE’S A “BACKGROUND” OF
A “GRAPHIC NOVEL” THAT MAKES ALL OF THIS GRAPHIC VIOLENCE AND DEPRAVITY
LIKE TOTALLY AWESOME. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT’S ABOUT AND THE
BACKGROUND, AND THAT DOESN’T JUSTIFY A THING. SO SAD FOR HITLER–HE
COMMITTED SUICIDE WAY TOO SOON. IF HE’D ONLY HUNG ON TO THE YEAR 2009
AND THE “BACKGROUND” AND “GRAPHIC NOVEL” EXCUSE, THAT WOULD MAKE THINGS
SO MUCH BETTER. I GOT THE “MESSAGE”–NOT SURE HOW IT JUSTIFIES A THING.
SOME SAY HITLER HAD A “GREAT MESSAGE.” EVER READ MEIN KAMPF? I GUESS
MAYBE A MESSAGE JUSTIFIES COOKING PEOPLE IN OVENS, TOO. BUT, HEY, HE
FORGOT TO MAKE MEIN KAMPF INTO A GRAPHIC NOVEL. BIG MISTAKE.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m sure she’ll calm down and realize that her reaction was a little rash.</p>
<blockquote><p>We know there are bad people and that people are
everyday people with problems. If you don’t know that, and you think a
movie like this is necessary to make the point, you’re even more warped
and stupid than I originally diagnosed. And maybe your sister should be
fed to dogs and your mother raped and your brother should have his arms
sawed off.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or not. I’m sure she speaks for <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/bwillingham/2009/03/05/a-few-predictions-about-watchmen/#more-73242">conservatives everywhe</a>—</p>
<blockquote><p>I love Rorschach was amazing . . . [a]nd Rorschach is this Conservative’s hero.</p></blockquote>
<p>Must be an outlier. There’s always someone who mis—</p>
<blockquote><p>I think Rorschach will do in the general population
exactly what he did in the comics community. He’ll seem to be disturbed
at first, but actually come away unintentionally by the creators, as
the hero of the piece.</p></blockquote>
<p>So . . . more on Manhattan as a figure of the reader as soon as I quell my doubts.</p>
<hr /><p>
*I’m aware she has an explanation for why she does this. But as I noted in <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/teaching-the-overdetermined-image-.html">my first post about my course</a>,
even when Alan Moore uses ALL CAPS in 1985 he still looks like an
internet crank. Schlussel seems to not understand the rhetorical effect
of her purely practical explanation. It doesn’t help her case that the <em>content</em> of her ALL CAPS commentary frequently scales the heights of internet crankdom . . . </p><p>(<em><a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/03/05/reading-is-fundamental-with-dummies-like-you-who-needs-the-mentally-disabled/">x-posted</a></em>.)</p>

The problem is a child rejecting Lesbians, embracing eusexuality, and walking mean streets armed for personal protection.</p>

<p>A world in which personal responsibility displaces Official protections is a managerial nightmare.  <i>Watchmen</i>&#39;s Rorschach is a threat to State hegemony, every airport boarding area to the sweet nectar of vice regulation.

My take on the debate over at EotAW (which is too thick for me to want to wade into at this point) is that she&#39;s not so much saying &quot;Please think of the children!&quot; as &quot;You people are horrible!&quot; and &quot;Hollywood is leading our kids down a moral sewer, gotta go!&quot;  Her argument isn&#39;t that well-meaning parents might be misled, but that parents can&#39;t be trusted (becuase they&#39;re liberal and/or trash and they suck).  This is where she differs from the violent hateful libertarian Rorschach lovers, like the fine commentator above.  You don&#39;t mention that Schlussel herself thinks that Rorschch isn&#39;t conservative and that the film as a whole is part of the liberal conspiracy.  Schlussel&#39;s form of hateful conservatism would seem to be more anit-vigalante and pro-iron fist.</p></span>

Bubbly undergraduates escort groups of thirty or so prospective students and their parents around Ring Road. After conferencing with students for a few hours, SEK runs to the Zot-n-Go for coffee. He wears his typical day-of-office-hours attire: an expensive sweater, rumpled jeans, trusty shoes and a backwards New York Mets cap. As he leaves he bumps into a FORMER STUDENT escorting prospectives and their parents around Ring Road. FORMER STUDENT: To your left you'll see the Student Center and the Zot-n-Go. Coming out of the Zot-n-Go is my favorite composition teacher ever (SEK waves and smiles politely as she puts her hand to her face and in an exaggerated whisper says) who actually wears that cap to class sometimes. PARENT: (loudly) Fucking loser. SEK: (stops) Excuse me? SEK turns to confront PARENT and sees the sort of uptight wealthy white folk who grow on trees out here. He comes from money and married young and is likely upset at how much a college education costs. He has a foot and about 100 lean lbs. on SEK. PARENT: You heard me. (steps to SEK) SEK: (walking backwards) I have office hours to attend to. PARENT: That's what I thought. SEK: (confused) You thought I had office hours? Because he ain't too bright, it is only now that SEK realizes that this forty-year-old in a starched business suit complete with snappy suspenders is trying to pick a fight with him. In broad daylight. On Ring Road. In front of his kid and a group of strangers. The PARENT makes for SEK, who shoots him a look and says . . . FROM THE DESK OF THE ACEPHALOUS INDUSTRIES LEGAL DEPARTMENT: SEK hereby declines to inform you what he allegedly said because his response might be construed as lame and unnecessarily inflammatory. In lieu of gratifying your desire to know what SEK allegedly said, SEK respectfully requests you guess what words were expelled by his constitutionally &quot;smart mouth.&quot; Furthermore: SEK acknowledges that although the unflattering description uttered by PARENT may not be inaccurate, at the time of the utterance said PARENT had no knowledge of this fact.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/03/i-performed-an-experiment-on-myself-and-i-do-believe-i-failed.html"><span><strong>I performed an experiment on myself and I do believe I failed.</strong> A friend sent me the text of a recent WSJ editorial entitled “Will This Crisis Produce a ‘Gatsby’?” I’ll link to it later—for now I want to recreate my bad-faith reading experience in all its glory. My first reaction was to the title, even though I know authors never write their own titles. But this one seemed sufficiently troublesome to warrant criticism. I wrote: You would think someone at the WSJ would know that enough about literature to know that The Great Gatsby was published in 1925. If you grant the title its premises, the question should be “Did Someone Write a ‘Gatsby’ in 2004 and If So Who Was He or She and What Was the Title of It?” But that’s not quite right. The WSJ‘s infuriating decision to publish the titles of books in quotation marks means that we’re not even sure whether the current crisis will be producing a novel affectionately called Gatsby or a fictional Jew with class insecurities who meets an untimely end. Because we have umpteen examples of the latter—Curb Your Enthusiasm may even be a Gatsby-in-progress. Tune in next season to find out! But even that’s not quite right. Given that The Great Gatsby preceded the financial crisis by more than half a decade, maybe the author wants to claim that Fitzgerald’s slim volume caused the Great Depression. In which case we must discover and burn all copies of the mysterious 2004 novel or unwrite the fictional Jew. Obama said we all needed to chip in. This is how we, as literary scholars, can do our part! Then I started reading the text itself. The mention of Louis Adamic seemed promising, and the rest of the article built what I took to be a fairly solid case until the last few paragraphs: John Steinbeck’s novel “The Grapes of Wrath” made the Joad family’s flight from the dust bowl into an emblem of people coming together to remake their world. A similar image was implicit in the very title of Dorothea Lange and Paul Taylor’s documentary book “An American Exodus.” Even works of light entertainment like the massively popular “Gone With the Wind” or John Ford’s landmark Western “Stagecoach” were in keeping with the prevailing message of the times. All these works told of epic journeys in which a group of people overcame destructive competition in their discovery of a common destiny. Each called for Americans to act collectively to remake a democratic society where opportunity would be open to all. In effect, such declarations helped lay the cultural groundwork for the New Deal, providing the ideological infrastructure for the new governmental institutions created during the ‘30s. My response? If there’s one thing I learned writing my dissertation, it’s that you can’t throw words like “ideology” around like that—especially not when you’re claiming that a book published in 1939 laid the groundwork for the policies that were curtailed in 1939 by “Dr. Win-the-War.” If I’d tried to end-around history like that I would’ve—I don’t...</span></a></div>
