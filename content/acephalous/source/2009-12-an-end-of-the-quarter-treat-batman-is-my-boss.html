<li>a <em>New York Review of Books </em>style review of the novelization of <em>Batman Begins</em>, in which the book is slammed for its Ludlum-lite car chases and unconvincing fisticuffs </li>

<p>The trick is the Writer&#39;s Memo.  They get all excited about the project, but their grade relies heavily on the rhetorical analysis of it they perform in the Memo.</p>

<p><em>I&#39;m curious, are a majority of the projects comic-book themed or are you a comic fan and thus such projects tend to be your favorites?</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s the way <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/10/by-request-my-visual-rhetoric-course.html" rel="nofollow">the course is set up</a> that makes all the final projects comic and/or comics-in-film related.  In previous quarters, when I taught stuff closer to my dissertation, the results were far more conventional: recreations of late C19th debates about evolution and society, essays about current sociobiological material written in the style of H.L. Mencken, etc.</p></span>

FOR AL GORE!!</strong> With the Climategate scandal freezing the bloom to anthropogenic global warming's rose, what will become of the those whose careers were based on the lie that the planet will soon become inhospitably hot? If only the scientists at East Anglia had a hacker of their own who could— Not quite what I expected, but I suppose it'll do.</span></a></div>

Scott thought typing with one hand would be easier. (Don't get any ideas, you dirty-minded lot. He busted his left wrist last night in a very manly fashion that didn't involve tripping over a belligerently hungry kitten no not one bit.) Scott can't be the only one who thought the response (&quot;I'm really fine. I'm really fine.&quot;) of the amnesiac played by Marc Blucas on Castle this week to the question &quot;What's your name?&quot; was a coincidence. (Or is Scott all hopped up on the Joyce?) Scott wonders whether it's just him or does this really not sound like David Foster Wallace in the least? Scott figured out the most efficient way to feel guilty: greeting his devout Muslim neighbor while marinating pork chops in beer. (&quot;I was trying to find a way to make this more offensive to you, and I did!&quot;) Regular posting will resume when typing doesn't require I crook my arm to spite my labrum.</span></a></div>
