<p>The &quot;what I like to call&quot; maneuver is lame, though, on DFW&#39;s part. Usually (as here) it introduces a weak or awkward coinage. Either commit to a locution, I want to holler at writers who do this, or omit it! (The imperative phrasing &quot;Call it Psy-Fi&quot; is only superficially more confident.)</p></span>

The book in question: Warren Ellis's one-shot cross-over between the Wildstorm imprint Planetary and the DC franchise that is the Batman. Ellis created the book as a means of investigating the enduring popularity of the superhero genre. Over the course of thirty-odd issues his team of quasi-cultural anthropologists tore through the history of the 20th Century in an attempt to answer that deceptively simple question: Why have impossible people in tights mattered so much for so long? Planetary/Batman: Night on Earth (2003) opens by jiggering that old comic standby: the multiverse. An incidental murderer named John Black has been having seizures, and every time he seizes, a blue dome extends from his body and shifts him and everyone else from one dimension to another. The dome looks like this: The people who shift from a point in their dimension to an already-occupied point in another end up like this: Not a pleasant way to die. So the Planetary team is called in to investigate. They learn that Black's fingerprints were recently found outside a soup kitchen and go to investigate. They corner him in an alley when: They reorient themselves and move to apprehend him when they hear something above them: That would be Batman circa 2003. How do I know? The Batsuit lacks the yellow shield around the symbol on his chest, meaning this iteration must come before the introduction of the &quot;New Look&quot; suit in Detective Comics #329 (July 1964) or after they retired the shield in Detective Comics #742 (March 2000): Factor in the photorealistic gestures and that can only be the Batsuit of the 21st Century. But why did folks at DC decide to go with the throwback costume at the dawn of a new century? Nostalgia? What happened in 2000 that made the less cartoonish Batsuit more attractive to fans of the book? Because the subtraction of the shield was not the only change: the greys now skew black, the blues shift black-navy, and the yellow of the utility belt pales to a washed and muted gold. My class and I begin to talk a little about the turn of the last century within the context of the story—at this point a fight between one member of the Planetary team and Batman—until the scene abruptly shifts again to reveal: Adam West! We talk about what America would have been like when the show was on the air (1966-1968) and then I show them this clip. Why would people in the 1960s want a Batman who walks into a bar and orders orange juice? What would have been appealing about a Batman who was a fully deputized Peace Officer in the Gotham City Police Department? They respond very generally about the Civil Rights Movement and Vietnam and and drugs and hippies and the perceived erosion of the moral fabric of society—at which point I stop and ask, &quot;Who exactly was perceiving...</span></a></div>

SEK: See the difference? Your tongue moves the same way with both sounds, but with the &quot;g&quot; your vocal cords vibrate. Let's play a game. The &quot;n&quot; sound is voiced too.
