			<p>No. You don’t need to be a white Republican to appeal to white 
Republicans: you merely need to tailor your rhetoric so that it appeals 
to white Republicans. Doesn’t matter what color you are. It’s not about 
the person on the stage: it’s about the audience that person’s appealing
 to. Meaning Deroy Murdock’s <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/316052/rnc-speakers-undermined-racist-code-deroy-murdock">entire post</a> is beside any and all points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Republican operatives truly  are brilliant enough to 
use secret code to convince white bigots to  pull the elephant lever in 
November, they should have been smart enough  to control the podium at 
their convention in Tampa, Fla. As a black man,  the Republicans’ racial
 code never penetrated my ears. However, my eyes  worked just fine. And 
what I repeatedly saw were minority faces on my  TV.</p>
<p>The racist dog whistles must have gone silent even for Labradors when
  a black woman and former secretary of state named Condoleezza Rice  
addressed the convention for nearly half an hour in prime time Wednesday
  night, just before vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan gave his  
acceptance speech, arguably Tampa’s finest. Similarly, and also in prime
  time, a Hispanic senator named Marco Rubio (R., Fla) introduced the  
Republican party’s presidential standard bearer, Mitt Romney, while 30  
million people tuned in …</p>
<p>And Rice and Rubio were far from alone. Black Republicans such as  
Representative Tim Scott of South Carolina; Saratoga Springs, Utah,  
mayor and congressional nominee Mia Love, and former Alabama  
representative Artur Davis (an ex-Democrat) all addressed the convention
  and were televised, at least on C-SPAN. Leading Hispanic Republican  
speakers included Texas Senate nominee Ted Cruz, Puerto Rico governor  
Luis Fortuño, New Mexico governor Susana Martinez, and Nevada governor  
Brian Sandoval. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley also wowed the  
crowd. She is an American of Indian descent, another ascendant minority 
 group.</p>
<p>These amplified, televised, and <em>loudly applauded</em> individuals
  of color holistically demolish the Left’s paranoid, feverish, and  
disgusting fantasy that white Republicans speak with white bigots  
through some tribal Caucasian dialect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His argument amounts to “Because people of color were on the stage 
the rhetoric couldn’t be designed to appeal to white people.” Except 
Murdock and his italics prove that argument wrong: if these people of 
color were “<em>loudly applauded</em>” then whatever rhetoric they used 
was effective on their audience. This is Rhetoric 101: all rhetorical 
appeals are effective on a given audience in a particular historical 
situation. It’s called “<a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2011/01/what-is-violent-rhetoric">the rhetorical situation</a>”
 and Murdock’s defined the Republican National Convention as one in 
which a person of color living in 2012 could muster up a message that 
appeals to a Republican audience. What does their audience look like? 
According to FOX News and the <em>Washington Times</em> it looked like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/washingtontimesrnc01.jpg"><img alt="" height="352" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/foxrnc02.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Republican Convention" width="496" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/washingtontimesrnc01.jpg"><img alt="" height="726" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/foxrnc03.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="foxrnc03" width="496" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/washingtontimesrnc01.jpg"><img alt="" height="309" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/washingtontimesrnc01.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="washingtontimesrnc01" width="495" /></a></p>
<p>All Murdock has proven is that people of color can effectively appeal
 to almost exclusively white audiences. There’s no logic to the claim 
that white Republicans can’t be racist because they approve of speech 
designed to pander to them. The more important point isn’t that white 
Republicans are racist but that the majority of Republicans are white. 
Why? Because that means the majority of rhetorical appeals made by 
Republican candidates to Republican audiences will be constructed to 
appeal to white people and white interests. When <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2009/11/you-only-noticed-im-white-because-youre-a-racist">Sarah Palin posted images of herself with her supporters</a>
 in 2009 I noted that they were self-selected. Palin’s people knew their
 audience and produced a visual spread that would appeal to it. The 
Republicans are in a similar situation: so long as their audience 
remains overwhelmingly white their most effective rhetoric must appeal 
to an overwhelmingly white audience. It doesn’t matter what color the 
person on the stage is. What matters is the diversity of the people—and 
therefore the diversity of interests—that the person on stage addresses.
 Speaking of which:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/washingtontimesdnc01.jpg"><img alt="" height="330" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/washingtontimesdnc02.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="washingtontimesdnc02" width="496" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/washingtontimesdnc01.jpg"><img alt="" height="335" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/washingtontimesdnc01.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="washingtontimesdnc01" width="496" /></a></p>
<p>Those are also from the <em>Washington Times</em> and demonstrate exactly why the Democratic Party must embrace diversity instead of <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/04/the-tea-partys-love-affair-with-tokenism">settling for tokenism</a>:
 in order to effectively appeal to this audience a speaker must consider
 a range of disparate interests and find a way to address all without 
denigrating any.</p>

But what’s interesting to me isn’t the content of the speech—whatever it was I didn’t watch it—but the reaction of conservatives to a successful speech by a prominent Democrat. Consider who’s discussing the two most popular transcripts according to memeorandum: For your convenience I clicked on all of the possible links to conservative blogs or news organizations. Notice something? Either it’s taking them a very long time to devise an effective strategy to counter Clinton’s rhetoric or they’ve decided that refusing to write about it will make it go away. In their defense there’s a good chance they’re correct—not because they’ve chosen to ignore it but because conventions aren’t important anymore—but I can’t pass up the opportunity to note the wonderful irony of watching the party of Manly Men Who Make Money and War paralyzed into a panicked silence when confronted by the molehill they’ve mistaken for a mountain.</span></a></div>
