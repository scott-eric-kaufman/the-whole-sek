<p>Would, but can&#39;t, do.  I need contact with the world, because with Meg gone, I&#39;m flailing.  And honestly, if any future employer can&#39;t recognize why I thought <em>being set on fire</em> was a reason to get a little panicked, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d want to work for them for fear, you know, of <em>being set on fire</em>.  </p></span>

<p>I was snarking future, unreasonable employers there, not you.  Just wanted that to be clear.</p>

<p>P.T. Smith,</p>

<p><em>Is this where my absurd anxieties and absurd, illogical oveveranalyzing thought-processes goes when I get that close to someone?</em></p>

<p>Yes.  On most days, it&#39;s bearable, but the fire chose to spring to life on a Thursday, when I&#39;m already exhausted from teaching and the commute, so I was primed to overreact. </p>

<p><em>I recognized all of this decision-making, except I&#39;ve never been in love with someone for a decade and been almost set on fire.</em></p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t call it &quot;decision-making,&quot; more like &quot;descent in temporary madness that vaguely resembles decision-making but really isn&#39;t.&quot;  Or something.  I&#39;m still fried.  I thought that writing about that night would get it out of my system---but the fear creeps back when I least expect it.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0133ee72123b970b-content"><p>My best advice for a panic attack: sit down and meditate on doing nothing but slowing down your breathing.  Your mind thinks that it&#39;s panicking because of whatever issue you&#39;re thinking about, but really you&#39;re mostly panicking because your body is caught in a spiral of escalating panic.</p>

<p>As for &quot;hypothetically doubting [your wife&#39;s] love&quot;, you&#39;re being melodramatic.  (Is this helping?  Hmm.)  I&#39;ve been married (or monogamously cohabiting, before marriage) with my partner for two decades now, and what lets people do that is communication.  The idea that love is supposed to be some mystical state where you never doubt each other or annoy each other is a myth.  You were doing the right thing in trying to get in touch with her at this crisis, for both your sake and hers.  Well, the idea that it might be a divorceable incident was over-the-top, but after all you were panicking.</p></span>

I am very sure that she would have responded just you and the cat/kid/boys.  Anything else is just not that important.  You might not be able to replace things lost, but after 36 years with your dad, I would say the only important thing to save is him.  We have so much stuff that I can say I would run around as you did putting things in boxes(like the last 2 hurricanes when we had to leave) and leaving stuff behind. All that stuff is just not important.  The message to your wife is you love her and miss her and are lost without her.  That is the lesson you learned by the task of saving and leaving behind.  Hope the rest of the time she is away you only have to deal with normal every day issues.</p></span>

<p><em>I&#39;ve been married (or monogamously cohabiting, before marriage) with my partner for two decades now, and what lets people do that is communication. The idea that love is supposed to be some mystical state where you never doubt each other or annoy each other is a myth.</em></p>

<p>Never would I claim I don&#39;t annoy her, as most of the time I can&#39;t stand myself.  (Am Jewish after all.)  But there <em>is</em> that other bit that&#39;s not explicit communication, borne of countless mornings silently commiserating over the time at which you&#39;re rising or the quality of the sleep you did or didn&#39;t have, and while that falls under the general aegis of &quot;communication,&quot; it&#39;s also more specific.  It&#39;s an accretion---to use the least romantic word ever---of shared history, and it&#39;s entirely possible to feel that that accumulation is being threatened by a singular event.  Believe you me, this I know.</p>

<p>Nick:</p>

<p><em>Is it wrong to take pleasure in your brushes with catastrophe because you write so vividly about the experience of having mental processes go haywire? </em></p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t share my insanity with the world if I thought otherwise.  I only ask that you don&#39;t take <em>too much</em> pleasure in it, as I suspect the gods tormenting me might too.</p>

<p>Chris:</p>

<p><em>Complementarily, &quot;STWYUDBTNMBDAWOYPDYWS&quot; is also pretty much a free pass for any momentary panic psychosis on the part of the spouse doing the packing. Especially when sitting down and taking deep breaths is contraindicated, as is usually the case when you&#39;re near a large quantity of burning poison oak.</em></p>

<p>In marriage, there are no free passes in marriage.  She&#39;s in Italy to get away from all this, and when I drag her and everyone she knows into its blaze, that sort of ruins the effect of the vacation.  Not that she doesn&#39;t care, or doesn&#39;t want know about it ... just that she&#39;d rather life here allow her to enjoy time there, and it very vociferously didn&#39;t the other night.  I sound like I&#39;m condemning her or something though, there, and I&#39;m not: think of it like a broken mood, with an underlying earnest desire to not have things go to shit while she&#39;s gone.  She was upset about things going to shit more than the mood being broken.</p>

<p>Mother:</p>

<p><em> I would say the only important thing to save is him. </em></p>

<p>For future reference: that first edition of <em>The Crying of Lot 49</em> is worth way more than you think it is.  I recommend saving it ... and Dad, too.</p>

<p><em>Hope the rest of the time she is away you only have to deal with normal every day issues.</em></p>

<p>You do remember who I am, right?  I only ask because you&#39;re talking about me dealing with &quot;normal every day issues,&quot; but am the son who, at fifteen, responded to a tympanoplasty by playing Montague and Capulet in a tree outside his girlfriend&#39;s window.  My issues are rarely everyday, and my response to them, however reasonable, never normal.  </p>

<p>Shane:</p>

<p><em>The more I read this blog, the more I think you&#39;re really a Woody Allen character...</em></p>

<p>I know, I know, everyone likes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_Memories" rel="nofollow">the old, funny stuff</a>.  But yes, as a cultural Jew, I&#39;m entitled by law to not only claim the sky is falling, but actually have a bit of it land on me.</p>

<p>Tina:</p>

<p><em>And, next, just get through the next five minutes, and when that&#39;s done, the five after that.</em></p>

<p>Easier said than done ... and I don&#39;t say to contradict you blithely, but because I kept telling myself again and again, but no matter how much I said it, it didn&#39;t get done.  The general principle is, however, sound.  It&#39;s what I&#39;m using to deal with the wife&#39;s absence on a daily basis, after all.</p>

<p><em>I bet you kinda wouldn&#39;t mind the shoe being on the other (i.e., your wife&#39;s) foot.</em></p>

<p>I think wishing that night upon her would officially make me a bad person, though.  I&#39;m hoping to inspire her into a similar experience via the power of the written word ... and we&#39;ll see where that gets me/us.</p></span>

And what about the hundreds of books you left in my care?  On a serious note your life has always been an adventure and far from normal, but I again say you have enough stories that you could fill many shelves with books written by you.  There are several movies that are just as strange as your life and perhaps you should pitch some stories to Hollywood!</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/05/im-done.html"><span><strong>I'm done.</strong> Not forever, but at least a week. I'm not blaming the internet, but I also don't want to have a nervous breakdown on it. I'm tired of being good-natured fodder for Unfogged, but I don't blame that lot either. I'm just tired. At some point even people who are accustomed to the improbable cease being able to deal with it, and I think I may have reached that point. So: I'll see you in a week. Maybe by then I will have a secret chart to get to the heart of this or any other matter.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/05/urbino.html"><span><strong>The effect of not being on vacation in Italy on a man with a tall stack of papers to grade.</strong> As you probably noticed, my wife is currently on vacation without me—which is different than a vacation from me, although given how frequently insufferable I am, I could understand the appeal of such—in the le Marche region of Italy, which is immediately south of Tuscany and full of communists. As evidence of how thoroughly corrupt the region is, I present a picture (courtesy of her) of the cabin she'll be staying in free of charge until July: That's the view she'll be writing her dissertation to the next two months. The region is poor (though not so much as I thought) and poorly serviced by internet and wifi: there's a router up the hill from her which sometimes provides wifi, but only then into a loft too unbearably hot to occupy during the day. So the only opportunity I have to talk to her (via Skype) is that last hour in the late evening when the loft cools enough to be habitable—provided, of course, that the wifi strength that evening is strong enough to establish and maintain a connection. Which it frequently isn't. But this post isn't about how melancholy I become when I haven't heard from her by 3 p.m. (which would be midnight over there), because anyone who follows me on Facebook already knows that and because this post concerns Urbino, not my daily descent into emo. I've written about Urbino before, but because the wife is providing me with such dazzling photographs of the city, I feel compelled to do so again. As I noted in that post, Urbino is not a &quot;built&quot; city so much as an &quot;evolved&quot; one. (The De Landa seems to have become an unwitting theme of late.) Of course it was built, but it was built vertically within the city walls, meaning that new buildings were constructed atop existing ones like so: The effect is the sort of architecture one only finds in dreams or representations of them, like the one in the finale of the fourth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, wherein Joss Whedon took advantage of contiguous three-walled film sets to depict Xander Harris moving seamlessly from the upstairs bathroom at Buffy's house: Into the Initiative's underground bunker: Then, from the bathroom-Initiative across the hall: Into his parent's basement: And into an ice cream truck: Past the the come-hither lesbians: Through the back of the ice cream truck: By means of a passage: That returns him to you guessed it his parents' basement: In which he exits the same door he originally entered it from Buffy's house only to end up in the halls of Sunnydale High and (shortly) an Apocalypse Now parody: The only difference between what Whedon did and Urbino is that you could travel through the side streets of Urbino with a camera and accomplish such feats (minus the Coppola) without needing to cut once. Because without leaving officially sanctioned lanes of transportation, pedestrians can venture into and through outdoor kitchens, university departments, the central hallway...</span></a></div>
