		<span id="comment-9098811-content"><p>Scott, what have your experiences been with courseblogs? I&#39;d like to hear more about that. I&#39;ve begun using them in my courses and so far so good (only two weeks worth of classes under my belt). In one class there&#39;s a blogging requirement and the students seem to be enjoying it (you know that when they start fussing with their templates to make it look different). It&#39;s still too early to tell, but so far so good. It&#39;s just so much more convenient to post things on my courseblogs than on a webpage. That&#39;s what I love the most about it. But I&#39;m still looking for ideas about how others use courseblogs.</p></span>

Makes a Statement of Conditions— Noble Response to Appeals By dark the entire city was submerged. The flooding of the electric-light plant and the gas plants left the city in darkness. To go upon the streets was to court death. The wind was then at cyclonic velocity, roofs, cisterns, portions of buildings, telegraph poles, and walls were falling, and the noise of the wind and the crashing of the buildings was terrifying in the extreme. During all this time the people...were like rats in traps. The histest portion of the city was four to five feet under water, while in the great majority of cases the streets were submerged to a depth of ten feet. To leave a house was to drown. To remain was to court death in the wreckage. Such a night of agony has seldom equaled.
