It has a lot more to do with noir than epic: detective story, corporate forces bigger than ourselves, uncertainty of good and evil, dark spaces and tight interiors.  Maybe you meant <i>Star Wars</i>?</p>

<p>That&#39;s my point: it&#39;s always one of the first films listed as &quot;epic,&quot; but it&#39;s not.  <em>Seven Samurai</em>&#39;s a closer fit, but even it&#39;s a fundamentally local film: one small village recruits seven heroes, &amp;c.  <em>Ran</em> comes closer, but that&#39;s Shakespeare.  There&#39;s a larger argument to be made here about Kurosawa and the unsuitability of Western definitions of epic to his work, I think, as <em>Sanjuro</em> would be epic, but for its focus on the niceties of local feudal politics.  The same goes for pretty much all Kurosawa&#39;s samurai films---not a bad thing so much as a bad fit with Western epic.</p></span>

(If it&#39;s because it&#39;s all shot in New Zealand--well, <i>The Iliad</i> all takes place outside of one city.)  And what about <i>Star Wars</i>?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of noise in that Google search because EPIC&#39;s also the name of a pirated copy of the film, but there&#39;s <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/30/entertainment/ca-blade30" rel="nofollow">this</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4492625.stm" rel="nofollow">this</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=HAma4m3w38EC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=%22blade+runner%22+epic&source=web&ots=nUVkXzCm2A&sig=Rd2xAaR6NDoBQD_QLfxLtmbikMY#PPA53,M1" rel="nofollow">this</a> comparison to Milton, &amp;c.  Essentially, though, we&#39;re in agreement here: <em>Blade Runner</em> shouldn&#39;t be considered an epic.  I&#39;ve just read more people who mistakenly say otherwise than you have.</p>

<p>The point about <em>Lord of the Rings</em> is that it&#39;s deemed an epic for the wrong reasons: it&#39;s the big canvas, not the epic tale, that wins the film its epic accolades.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-144031784-content"><p>Okay…so to prove that film cannot be epic (<i>is</i> that what you&#39;re trying to prove? total guess on my part), you picked one epic that we agree is not an epic (<i>Blade Runner</i>) and one that <i>is</i> an epic, but which some people apparently have the <i>wrong reasons</i> for thinking it&#39;s an epic (<i>Lord of the Rings</i>).  Also <i>Seven Samurai</i> isn&#39;t epic because it&#39;s about one place, ignoring the epics that also focus on one geographic location (<i>The Iliad</i>).</p>

<p>I looked at the comments at Edge of American West, and I&#39;m really glad to see that no one there really knows what you&#39;re talking about, either.  I was worried that I was an idiot.</p></span>

Before, it was primarily a poetic genre, but now it just signifies big landscapes. Indeed, it&#39;s hard for me to hear the word without thinking of Lawrence of Arabia, even though by the old definition there&#39;s little that&#39;s epic about LOA.</p></span>

<p>I will say that I am intrigued by the application of &quot;about&quot; to film. In many senses, film is never &quot;about&quot; what is seen. It is always made up of what occurs in between the 24 frames a second, what goes on outside the camera&#39;s view, and what is left behind on the editor&#39;s floor. The idea of small screen vs. big screen is also intriguing. Do you mean movie (projected) vs. television (projecting)? Or do you mean big screen theaters vs small screen art houses and multiplexes. You have a lot of ground to cover here and I think its worth covering the ground. </p>

<p>And btw, not Blade Runner.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-144085872-content"><p>Tom, you&#39;re right that I punted the bit about <em>Seven Samurai</em>.  Or punted it a bit: I do think there are similar translation problems moving from Greece to Japan as there were from Greece to Rome---the difference between oral and written epic being one of them, but also the cultural difference between a work self-consciously written as a national epic and one which is arguably only incidentally so.  But <em>Seven Samurai</em> fits into the Aristotelian definition.</p>

<p>JP, this strikes me as absolutely correct:</p>

<p><em>Before, it was primarily a poetic genre, but now it just signifies big landscapes.</em></p>

<p>But what I wanted to investigate is how those two ideas are interrelated, so much so it&#39;s seems intuitively wrong to not call a film with a suitably big canvas &quot;epic&quot; no matter its narrative.</p>

<p>Drip, yes!  I mean, yes, that&#39;s what I&#39;m getting at, however obliquely or wrong-headedly---&quot;epic&quot; is a description of form <em>and</em> content that, with film, seems to have become wholly about form.  An epic film need not address epic content, because LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT SCREEN!  As I wrote at <em>Edge of the West</em>:</p>

<blockquote>when directors mistake the kind of narrative they have, their judgments about how to present it end up skewed. To a certain extent, they make movies for the big screen because that’s where they’re displayed <em>first</em>, but not necessarily <em>best</em>. The reason I brought up <em>The Dark Knight</em> and <em>Iron Man</em> is because, in both cases, the directors got caught up in the faux-epical quality imparted by the screen—whereas both worked better as the smaller, more character-driven pieces they appeared to be on the television set.</blockquote>

<p>I think the <em>experience</em> of watching a film---be it shared at the multiplex or intimate on the couch---radically changes how we perceive the material, and that because films seem to have &quot;epic&quot; as their default setting, they miss the opportunity to become the epic they purport (or are purported) to be.  </p></span>

Similarly with Lord of the Rings: even if the film itself fails on all counts, the making of the film was an epic task….<br />
Marc Bloch said, “To the great despair of historians, men fail to change their vocabulary every time they change their customs. ” (The Historian’s Craft, p. 34). The use of “epic” in regard to films such as Blade Runner and LotR may be an error, but it is not a simple matter of ignorance of Aristotle.<br />

		<span id="comment-144293510-content"><p>I kind of half paid attention to the EoAW comments and a weird art and history in film thing at L,G&amp;M and well, I try to earn a living, all of which is by way of  excuse for not responding more quickly or fully to this wonderful topic.  Film is a distinct medium from that of sculpture, painting/photography, and narrative (whether poetry or prose.) Inherent in the medium is what is not there. Film is discontinuous and two dimensional. It exists in time. It shows only part of what goes on; seems to show more that words can describe and yet film is always and necessarily incomplete. The brain must both fill in gaps and ignore what isn&#39;t there. This is so obvious it should go without saying, but watching a film on  a small screen is like looking at a picture of a sculpture or a poem. Such a picture might stand on its own as art, but it is not a sculpture or a poem; it is a picture. When you see a movie on a small screen, it is not the same thing that the director created in the same way that the postcard of the Sistine Chapel is not the Sistine Chapel . The movie epic can be epic because it is in an epic scale and it will fail if it does not have the size to carry it off. This is the idea of little movies. You can see an epic narrative on your TV, but that is the narrative that is epic, not the film. And that&#39;s what I have time for now.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-144376914-content"><p>Speaking as someone who doesn&#39;t think about the art of film very much, I&#39;m surprised you all make such a big distinction between the experience of watching movies at a theater vs. at home.  I can see how the grandness of the giant screen and cavernous hall of a movie theater contribute to a feeling of &quot;epicness&quot;.  But this seems to say more about the invalidity of the category of &quot;epic&quot; than it does about any particular movie.  If (say) &quot;Ben Hur&quot; (or substitute whatever can pass as unambiguously epic) isn&#39;t an epic when I watch it on my 15&quot; black-and-white television, then what is it?</p>

<p>The discussion would seem sillier if the genre in question were &quot;comedy&quot; or &quot;horror film&quot;, but not by much.  Certainly some humor or horror feels different in a theater full of strangers than it does alone with your family, but not enough to shake the foundation of either genre.<br />

You show them a panel from the surprisingly awful Superman and Batman vs. Aliens and Predator like, say, this and ask them to talk about the image as a crafted artifact and they will sit there, stone-silent, for fifty minutes while you prattle on about how (1) the writer wanted Batman represented by a powerful gloved hand and (2) the original alien was a giant penis preying on (a) the crew of the Nostromo and (b) our inborn fear of alien interspecies rape. You show them the H.R. Giger painting that inspired Ridley Scott: and tell them that there’s phallic imagery, phallic imagery, and then there’s the work of H.R. Giger—and still they sit there staring at your Freudian hammer in a World of Nails. You inform them that the lips of the alien were constructed from six stretched and shredded condoms smeared with KY jelly while they quietly compose comments for Rate My Professor about how everything in your course is about sex. “Not everything,” you insist. “But I mean, come on now, clearly this alien is. It is a giant penis, and within it is another penis, a penis within a penis, and in this panel Batman is firmly gripping that inner penis—” And you stop because no matter what you say, professors who open semesters with images of Batman giving an alien a hand job get comments on Rate My Professor about how everything in their course is about sex.* But it doesn’t have to end like this—there is a better way. With the help of erstwhile commenter Luther Blissett, I’ve designed an introduction to visual rhetoric assignment that forces students to understand that all comic and film images are obscenely overdetermined. On the first day of class, I’ll present them with Alan Moore’s script for the eighth panel on the first page of The Killing Joke: NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT THE POLICE CAR SIDE-ON SO THAT WE SEE THE UNIFORMED OFFICER STANDING FACE-ON TO US OVER ON THE LEFT AS HE STANDS WITH HIS BACK TO THE CAR AND COMMISSIONER GORDON FACE-ON OVER TO THE RIGHT, LEANING AGAINST THE CAR AND DRNKING HIS STEAMING COFFEE, MAYBE LOOKING UP WITH A QUIZZICAL AND CONCERNED LOOK OVER THE RIM OF HIS CUP TOWARDS THE EXTREME LEFT OF THE FOREGROUND, WHERE WE CAN SEE THE BATMAN ENTERING THE PICTURE FROM THE LEFT, IN PROFILE. SINCE BATMAN IS (a) CLOSER TO US AND (b) TALLER THAN EITHER THE COMMISSIONER OR THE PATROLMAN IN THE BACKGROUND WE CANNOT SEE THE TOP OF HIS HEAD HERE ABOVE THE BOTTOM OF THE NOSE AS THE FRONT OF HIM ENTERS THE PANEL ON THE LEFT. HIS EYES AND UPPER HEAD ARE INVISIBLE BEYOND THE TOP PANEL BORDER AND ALL WE CAN REALLY SEE IS HIS MOUTH, WITH THE BIG AND DETERMINED SQUARE JAW AND THE...</span></a></div>
