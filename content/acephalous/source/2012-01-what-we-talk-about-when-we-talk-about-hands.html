<p>All of which is only to say that, for obvious reasons, my eye&#39;s been trained to seek out and find meaning in hands. Hands, as I noted in <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/01/leverage-post.html" target="_self">my post on &quot;The Van Gogh Job,&quot;</a> do things. Directors and artists—perhaps especially comic artists—focus on hands because they&#39;re humanity&#39;s native tools. Any other tool we have, for the most part, is either an actual or imaginative extension of our hands. So when I teach Craig Thompson&#39;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1891830430/diesekoschmar-20" target="_self">Blankets</a></em>, I begin with <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/09/teaching-panel-transitions-via-craig-thompsons-blankets.html" target="_self">a tailored introduction to McCloud and comic theory</a>, then I move on to the hands. Why import a tic I noticed in London to a book written a century later? Consider the evidence:</p>

<p>Thompson&#39;s rough but fluid style is meant to be evocative, not realistic, otherwise Craig and Phil (the boys pictured in the bed) would be like&#0160;shih tzus unto their father. More significantly, measure it out and you&#39;ll realize that their father&#39;s hand is the same length as his head, which isn&#39;t an impossibility—the NBA does exist, after all—but is very much an improbability. Point being: Craig and Phil&#39;s father has a gigantic hand, one capable of doing many things, some of which may be horrible. For example:</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<div class="photo-wrap photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e5f7ce96970c" id="photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e5f7ce96970c" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 500px;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e5f7ce96970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Thompson hands02" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e5f7ce96970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e5f7ce96970c-500wi" title="Thompson hands02" /></a></div>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>That&#39;d be a close-up of Phil being manhandled from his bed by his father. Note how the close-up emphasizes the size of Phil&#39;s head relative to his father&#39;s fist. Note also the emblem on Phil&#39;s pajama top, as the irony&#39;s by all means intended. Continuing:</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<div class="photo-wrap photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef016760f6a271970b" id="photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef016760f6a271970b" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 500px;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef016760f6a271970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Thompson hands03" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef016760f6a271970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef016760f6a271970b-500wi" title="Thompson hands03" /></a></div>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Phil&#39;s being dragged into an attic space of composed of pure darkness. All the light in this panel originates in the room behind Phil and his father. The implication is that as soon as that hand—and only that hand, as the hand&#39;s replaced the father&#39;s face in the iconography of this scene—as soon as that hand slams shut that door, that darkness will overtake Phil. That hand&#39;ll be responsible for both the present and lifetime of fear Phil will have to cope with, because according to Craig&#39;s memory of the events, it&#39;s the hand, not the man, that did the deed. The significance of hands throughout the book can&#39;t be understated, but because students will be writing essays on topics like this, I&#39;ll understate it a bit: my evidence for the importance of hands come in an early flashforward:</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Here, again, is Phil being manhandled. Not by his father this time, but by another, and without ruining anything for anyone who hasn&#39;t read the book, Phil would&#39;ve been better off having been locked in the cubby hole again. Because the way that anonymous hand completely consumes Phil&#39;s tiny fingers?</p>
<p>Never a good sign.&#0160;</p>

<p>You&#39;re not kidding....</p>

<p>Hands are funny things: we don&#39;t think about them consciously much, but when we do, it can be disabling (I know the first time I watched a video of myself teaching, my wandering hands were all I could see for a long while). A lot of artists have admitted to having trouble with hands (and more have had trouble with hands, but been unable to admit it) precisely because of how subtly communicative and meaningful they are. It&#39;s a little bit like the caterpillar who was asked &quot;how do you keep track of all those feet?&quot; and never walked again.</p></span>

<p>I remember reading something, ages ago, talking about medical students observing an autopsy and which parts of the body tended to make people most uncomfortable. It said that there was very little discomfort around, for example, the genitals, which you might expect, but that the two things that made people very anxious were cutting (or injuries to) hands or eyes. Which makes sense, those are the two body parts that we gesture with and, therefore, the parts that we watch most closely on other people.</p></span>

South Carolina in the Revolutionary War had a young 13-year-old named Andrew Jackson. He was sabred by a British officer and wore a scar his whole life. Andrew Jackson had a pretty clear-cut idea about America’s enemies: Kill them. He was in South Carolina and had just related an anecdote about Andrew Jackson, so I can see why he'd quote Andrew as the Jacksonian source of the &quot;Kill them!&quot; quotation. Only Andrew Jackson didn't say it—Stonewall Jackson did. Accounts as to who he said it to vary, but the circumstances in which he said it don't. Union forces greatly outnumbered Southern forces at theBattle of Fredericksburg, and shortly after the death of Brigadier General Maxcy Gregg, someone asked Jackson how the Confederate forces could win. He responded Kill them, sir! Kill every man! Which, of course, refers to the Union soldiers. So America's enemies are, by Gingrich's account, other Americans. (Most likely Democrats.) There's the possibility that his error represents an eleventh dimensional dog-whistle blown for the benefit of the strong neo-Confederate presence in South Carolina, but I somehow doubt it.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/01/claustrophobia-is-a-cumulative-effect.html"><span><strong>Claustrophobia is a cumulative effect.</strong> (Yet another one of those posts.) Representing claustrophobic situations on screen should be simple enough: you take a person, put them in a confined space, and then you bury them alive. Doesn't matter if they're Buffy (in &quot;Bargaining&quot;): Or Bones (in &quot;Aliens in a Spaceship&quot;): Or some character played by Ryan Reynolds (in a dull film I wish I hadn't seen): Each of those cramped shots communicates to the audience that, like Everett in O Brother, Where Art Thou, someone's in a tight spot. But that's the problem: it communicates the narrow confines in which the characters find themselves, but because the &quot;coffin shot&quot; has become so clichéd, it does so the same way that a sequence of reverse shots inside a car communicates that the participants of a given conversation are driving. Only the oblique angle of the shot of Reynolds comes close to doing what a &quot;coffin shot&quot; is intended to do: duplicate in the audience the claustrophobia felt by the character. (And it only does so because of the odd angle. Most the film uses more conventional &quot;coffin angles&quot; and is as enervated as the other shots above.) Point being: filmmakers are quite proficient at representing people in enclosed spaces and communicating that said people are feeling claustrophobic, but they're not nearly as accomplished at making the audience feel the confinement represented the on screen. From the examples above, it's obvious that two techniques don't work: 1) placing characters in an enclosed space for a short duration and 2) placing characters in an enclosed space for a long duration. The first falls victim to convention, whereas the second flirts dangerously with boredom. (I disagree vehemently with Ebert on the effectiveness of Buried.) But if acclimation to convention has vitiated the tools with which a director could cajole claustrophobia from the audience (and if said director's not interested in making a tedious stunt of a film), how can an episode or a film be claustrophobic? The answer is: holistically. By which I mean, burying characters for X-amount-of-claustrophobic-time won't cut it, because that still leaves Y-amount-of-non-claustrophobic-time acting as an atmospheric counterweight. The entire episode or film must be shot with claustrophobia in mind. To use the episode of Bones as an example, too many shots in the episode are scaled too long: Does this long shot feel claustrophobic to you? Of course not. It's a brightly lit long shot: the lighting (and depth of field) allows the audience to observe details in the fore-, mid- and background, while the scale assures the audience that there's plenty to observe in all those grounds. To think counterfactually for a moment, it's not that shot couldn't be made more claustrophobic. Had the director cropped out some unnecessary visual information: Still a long shot, but by focusing more narrowly on Agent Booth and the lab technician, the space on-screen seems more cramped. If those officers in the back were to scoot a few feet to the left, the composition of the shot would...</span></a></div>
