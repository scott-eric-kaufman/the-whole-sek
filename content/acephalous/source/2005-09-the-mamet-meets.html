name which may not be his real name. A ravaged and blasted landscape. A
world that was ampler and more open once, but is permeated with
pointlessness now. Mysterious dispensers of beatings. A man of property
and his servant, in flight. And the anxiety of the two who wait, their
anxiety to be as inconspicuous as possible in a strange environment
(&quot;We’re not from these parts, Sir&quot;) where their mere presence is likely
to cause remark. It is curious how readers and audiences do not think
to observe the most obvious thing about the world of the play, that it
resembles France occupied by the Germans, in which its author spent the
war years. How much waiting must have gone on in that bleak world; how
many times must Resistance operative—displaced person when everyone was
displaced, anonymous ordinary people for whom every day renewed the
dispersal of meaning—have kept appointments not knowing whom they were
to meet, with men who did not show up and may have had good reasons for
not showing up, or bad, or may even have been taken; how often must
life itself not have turned on the skill with which overconspicuous
strangers did nothing as inconspicuously as possible, awaiting a
rendezvous, put off by perhaps unreliable messengers, and making do
with quotidian ignorance in the principal working convention of the
Resistance, which was to let no one know any more than he had to.</p>
<p>We can easily see why a Pozzo would be unnerving. His every gesture
is Prussian. He may be a Gestapo official clumsily disguised.</p></blockquote><p>Kenner elsewhere insists that <em>Waiting for Godot </em>is &quot;an absolutely realist portrait of the occupation&quot; that could only be accomplished when a man finds himself in &quot;a historical situation in which all the responses are cliches.&quot;&nbsp; Simply &quot;remove the clues to what the situation is&quot; and what had been&nbsp; &quot;an absolutely realist 
&nbsp; &nbsp; portrait of the occupation&quot; becomes an absurdist work about two people trying to do nothing as inconspicuously as possible.&nbsp; But what an evening spent in the company of Mamet forced upon me was that it isn't that the context has been stripped that so disturbs me about <em>Waiting for Godot </em>but that the characters speak as if they still live in a world in which their definitive articles point to anything definitive.&nbsp; They admit they're &quot;not from these parts&quot; but &quot;these parts&quot; consists of the ditch, the tree and the road.&nbsp; That they specify that they're not from &quot;these parts&quot; implies that there are some identifiable parts they are from.&nbsp; Where &quot;those parts&quot; are in relation to &quot;these parts&quot; is unfathomable and yet the language they speak is rife with referential implications.</p>

<p>The cumulative effect of this language is such that it unseats the person hearing or reading it from his or her current context.&nbsp; It intoxicates whatever part of the brain processes reference with possibilities never likely to be encountered in daily life and that intoxication is experienced by those who favor Beckett as the steady buzz of fine white wine.&nbsp; (Everyone else feels dosed.)&nbsp; What I find compelling about Kenner's argument isn't that it denudes Beckett's play of its power to unseat (some literally, some psychologically) an audience but that it grounds this dissociation in the knowable world.&nbsp; In <em>Spartan </em>Mamet manages much the same effect.&nbsp; As the film progresses it becomes increasingly unclear who &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; are or how &quot;they&quot; relate to &quot;the girl&quot; or &quot;the handlers.&quot;&nbsp; As the confusion mounts, however, the pace of the plot quickens.&nbsp; The more I invested in the mounting action the less I understood but the more I wanted to.&nbsp; Quite the trick Mamet employs there.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Quite <em>the</em> trick.&nbsp; (Repeated for effect.&nbsp; That &quot;the&quot; doesn't lack a referent.&nbsp; It's right there.&nbsp; See it?&nbsp; Right there?)</p>

Or a drunk. (Different, as souvenir shirts once scattered across Southern Louisiana—mostly in the French Quarter but available everywhere come Fat Tuesday—different, that is, from alcoholics because drunks don't go to meetings.) Speaking of drunks, I like to drink. Because I'm a graduate student. And a drunk. But not an alcoholic. How do I know? Back when I had cancer and couldn't drink for fear of interfering with the chemo, it came to my attention that while I enjoy unwinding in the evening with a drink (or two or three or enough shots to send me bending for a fortnight), I hadn't reached the point where I needed a drink to unwind. Now maybe there's a stage in the writing process during which all dissertators drink a little more than they should or safely handle. If there is I haven't reached it. Because I can drink prodigious amounts of alcohol and feel nary a thing. To wit: This evening I've recreated a wonderful concoction named something like a Double Super Sucker Nipple Twister. It consists of Pineapple juice, Malibu Pineapple Rum and Jagermeister. Yes, Jagermeister. I know many of you will scoff when I say that my favorite mixed drink consists in part of a liquor reputed to contain the blood of Bambi's mother. I suffer this embarrassment not because of the blood of Bambi's mother, who according to Whit Stilman is responsible for the modern environmental movement, but because Jagermeister's the shot of choice amongst &quot;shot connoisseurs&quot; like all of these incredibly refined folk. (All of whom were found, I feel it necessary to add, by a Google image search for &quot;Jagermeister.&quot; That such drunken revelry appears at the very mention of the drink's name should be damning. Should, I say, should. Not is. Bear with me.) So I have my cocktail, and it contains Jagermeister, and I have similar cocktails on a fairly regular basis. Or I have since I've kicked the cancer and worked in earnest on my dissertation. (Not that I wasn't working on it when I had cancer. I was. Only I wasn't working on it so well, what with the insomia and nausea and wanting to cry like a spoiled child all the time.) But I digress. From my digression. From this digression in a digressive post that people will undoubtedly think Jagermeister responsible for. Well, &quot;people,&quot; I said I recreated a cocktail. I haven't started drinking it yet—and even if I had, my tolerance is so manly at this point that I could've downed a couple of shots of Jager, peirced my ears, stuck some clasps through them, attached said clasps to a keg of Jager and walked around some nondescript stage like that guy in that photo I've already linked to. I'm that manly. (Or...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/course_blog_or_.html"><span><strong>Course Blog, or See How Insouciant I Am!</strong> Some of you have mentioned wanting to know what my course blog would look like. Wonder no longer! I'm obviously planning on expanding it to incorporate 1) the authors we read during the quarter and 2) more links to articles by working literary journalists, but for the most part what you see there is what I'll be posting on it all this year. Which is only to say that the voice you hear here is the voice with which I teach and interact with students. I've cultivated it for more than five years at this point, so I'm comfortable both writing and interacting with students in it .... and I think it has the right balance of &quot;anal-retentive intellectual insecurity manifested in harsh but constructive criticisms&quot; and &quot;cheerleader&quot; to make this and future classes a success. (Which is only to say to those who insist I'm &quot;a natural&quot; in the classroom that I've worked damned hard to appear to be &quot;a natural&quot; and would on occasion appreciate a little bit of credit. No one is really this charming.) All of which can be summed up by quoting some of my ratings from RateMyProfessors.com. Which I won't do for false modesty and fear that others will think it uncouth to inform people of my &quot;hotness,&quot; because let me tell you, sitting in this very chair for fifteen hours a day, every day, watching my five o'clock shadow turn six, seven and eight until it circles back to five again is the epitome of beastly sexiness. (Or is that sexless beastliness? I'm so easily confused sometimes.) The plan for the course blog is that I'll be posting my prep. work a day or two before every class (which means I'll have to complete prep. work at least a day before every class and can thus avoid the scrambling for thoughts and copies every couple hours before every other class) and require the students to respond to at least two posts per week. That doesn't seem onerous, and because I'm teaching literary journalism to students who have come to UCI expressly to study literary journalism, they're usually more than eager to become the voracious readers they've seen twiddling thier thumbs in old world libraries on television since they were toddlers. Again, I'll post updates (or email privately if this isn't a matter of general interest) until I've wrinkled all the irons out .... or something like that.</span></a></div>
