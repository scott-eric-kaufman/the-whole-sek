				<blockquote><p><strong>Thomas Pynchon's liner notes for Lotion's <em>Nobody's Fool</em></strong></p>

<p>The name of Lotion's first album is <em>Full Isaac</em>, which besides getting instant screams of recognition from <em>Love Boat</em> rerun watchers everywhere, shows an attentive nostalgia at work—not to mention some dream of an endless cruise, upon which <em>Nobody's Cool</em> is the next leg of the band's creative itinerary. As beneath the austerities of twelvetone music may lurk some shameless piece of baroque polyphony, so, throughout this album, beneath the formal demands of rock and roll as we have come to know it, between the metal anthems and moments of tonal drama, the darkest of surrealist lyrics, the most feedback-stricken, edge-of-chaos guitar passages, may also be detected the weird jiving sense of humor of a cruise combo, even an allegiance to the parameters thereof, the lounge chords on &quot;Namedropper&quot; and &quot;Rock Chick,&quot; the bass line of &quot;Juggernaut,&quot; so forth.</p>

<p>But ... it's supposed to be the Millenium here—the Apocalypse, right?—worse it's New York in the middle of a seasonal charm deficiency—and these guys are smiling? Well, not exactly. If it's a cruise gig, it sure runs through peculiar waters, full of undetonated mines from the cultural disputes that began in the Sixties, unexplained lights now and then from just over the horizon, stowaways who sneak past security and meddle with the amps causing them to emit strange Rays, unannounced calls at ports that seem almost like cities we have been to, though not quite, cityscapes that all converge to New York in some form, which is after all where these guys are from.</p>

<p>The recording studio is half a block from the subway. Times Square is being vacated and jackhammered into somebody's idea of an update. Next door to Peepland, up in a control room out of <em>The Jetsons</em>, the band, between takes, are discussing Bobby &quot;Boris&quot; Pickett, on whose 1962 hit &quot;Monster Mash&quot; it turns out Rob's substitute music teacher in elementary school played saxophone. Everybody here knows the record, not necessarily the Birth of Rap, less an influence than something trying to find a pathway through to us here in our own corrupted and perilous day, when everybody's heard everything and knows more than they wish they did. It's never certain how these things will be carried on, but mysteriously it happens. Every night, somewhere on the outlaw side of some town, below some metaphysical 14th Street, out at the hard edges of some consensus about what's real, the continuity is always being sought, claimed, lost, found again, carried on. If for no other reason, rock and roll remains one of the last honorable callings, and a working band is a miracle of everyday life. Which is basically what these guys do.</p>

<p>And here they are, now. Find the remote, get out the Snapple and Chee-tos, and like the Love Boat staff always sez, welcome aboard.</p></blockquote>

		<span id="comment-92068564-content"><p><b>Comment the first:</b></p>

<p>People must really have hated the Lotion.</p>

<p><b>Comment the second:</b></p>

<p>Mike, I came to graduate school with the Pynchon/Joyce interests, inasmuch as I was one of those Pynchon/Joyce/Foster Wallace people -- you know, the people who enjoy long, ambitious novels written in difficult prose.  (I don&#39;t know why, but Big Difficult Novel people have very predictable tastes.  I mean, most people could nail my favorite books, only they&#39;d throw Delillo in there, which would anger me.)  So, the short version is that I came to grad school to study Joyce more than Pynchon, but have written about both.  (Joyce for three seminars, Pynchon for Derrida, then again for Katherine Hayles&#39; Big Books seminiar.)  (Not that I wrote the same paper twice, as that&#39;d be cheating.)  </p>

<p>THEN!  (Dramatic, ain&#39;t it?)  THEN!  (Now not so much.)  I TA&#39;d for Laura O&#39;Connor&#39;s Irish Modernism course, at the end of which she invited me to dinner with her and her husband, James Olney, with whom I&#39;d take a course on Theories of Memory my second quarter here.  During the course of this dinner, they were very frank about the job prospects for people who do Big Books: &quot;There aren&#39;t any,&quot; she said.  I&#39;d either need to work the Irish or American angle, but I couldn&#39;t do both.  </p>

<p>THEN!</p>

<p>She said there aren&#39;t that many jobs for Irish modernists, since Joyceans abound, so I&#39;d have to be a modernist, and if I wanted a job, I should focus on the British side of the pond.  But much as I liked Joyce, I didn&#39;t want to spend the rest of my life teaching Pound and Eliot, so I drifted for a bit, took a course with Michael Szalay, and decided to hitch my wagon to his star.  (Mostly because he was the biggest, most-demanding asshole I&#39;d worked with since Pat McGee as an undergrad.  Lest you think that an insult, I don&#39;t intend it as such: he&#39;s a harsh, exacting critic who doesn&#39;t pull punches or coddle you when you write crap, as I frequently do.  I&#39;m a far better writer and thinker for working with him and am, in fact, quite embarrassed by what I would&#39;ve become had I not.)  But yes, so anyway, where was I?</p>

<p>Yes, I was working on C20th American stuff -- race and literature, in the &#39;30s and &#39;40s, and dabbling in the socialist literature of the period as well -- when I started preparing for my exams.  Over the course of them and the dissertation prospectus workshop, I discovered I was much more interested -- and therefore far more motivated to work on -- the influence of evolutionary theory in literature.  (There&#39;s a connection there, and yes, it&#39;s eugenics.  But I couldn&#39;t just start writing about material in the &#39;30s and &#39;40s without having read what came before, and then I realized that&#39;s where all the excitement was.)</p>

<p>Thus endeth the story. </p></span>

<p>All the information&#39;s been related before, just never in the same place.  It was sort of gratifying to write in a look-how-far-I&#39;ve-come kind of way.</p>

<p><em>Which time did you go to Hayles&#39;s big books seminar?</em></p>

<p>Well, me and my classmates only &quot;went&quot; to one ... then Hayles, one of the most generous people ever, decided <em>to drive down to UCI, through rush hour traffic, to teach us UCI folk <b>as soon as she finished teaching the same exact material at UCLA</b></em>.  There&#39;s a post in that story, if only so one day, while vanity Googling, Hayles stumbles across it and knows that her efforts were as appreciated as they were arduous.  (More so, even.)</p>

<p><em>So most people don&#39;t change their field of study based on the same reason I did: the need to color-coordinate the paperback books with the bookcase?</em> </p>

<p>All of mine are that Penguin puke-green ... so yes, I suppose I did.</p></span>

<p>I too was a &quot;big book&quot; fan and at the time was obsessed with reading or hearing anything Pynchon wrote (including book blurbs.)</p>

<p>Lotion was a damn fine band through 2 CDs and the Agnew Funeral EP. They lost their way a bit with the Telephone Album but even that was an above average effort.</p>

<p>My band has played &quot;La Boost&quot; and &quot;Juggernaut&quot; live before.</p>

<p>One last thing: I&#39;m a nobody, so I guess that means I&#39;m cool.</p></span>

Before you ask: I guestimate readership by adding unique page views to Feedburner subscribers, which seems to me the best way to calculate how many people read your blog daily. (But I've been wrong before.) There may also be some information I didn't share with the class when I first posted some items ... but what can I say? The truth never appears online, no matter how much we pray Trent Lott left a paper trail. So without further ado, here's what I said. (Please don't watch it, as I sound as foolish as I look.) Part one: Part two: The Q &amp; A can be found here and here. Be warned: I talk of Casper and the ensuing fiasco, which you'll find dull and should skip. (Thanks to Liz Losh, without whose sense of professional responsibility I'd still have my dignity.)</span></a></div>

I'm flattered by the nomination, if a little confused as to why they think Acephalous is a blawg. I suppose I do require legal assistance a little more than the average blogger ... but my point is this is another award I want to win, and this time Chris Clarke ain't around to scuttle my dreams: Most Pretentious Blawg of The Year The Poetry Sewer (http://thevalve.org/) For overdosing on neoRomanticism; for maintaining Oxford-branded snobbery whilst having no sense of humor whatsoever. The Unmarxist Unsupernanny (www.antigram.blogspot.com) For his insidious attempts to throw rivals into the syntaxic grid. For inspiring blog debates without having the guts to lose them. The Decapitated (www.acephalous.typepad.com) For selling word salads as high-culture literary theory. I credit them with stealing my joke—all my best critics steal my material—but am stumped by how the actual voting works. They say &quot;send in your votes via the comments box,&quot; but like every other post on the Cultural Parody Center, the comments to this post consist entirely of &quot;jonquille do camembe&quot; and &quot;parodycenter&quot; masterfully feigning intelligence. The meta-parody involved is breathtaking. (I'm not even sure whether I'm nominated for parodying pretentious legal blawgers or for being one myself.) Consider the second &quot;vote&quot;: I finally watched all of ‘IT’S A MAD MAD MAD MAD WORLD’ for the first time I saw it with my brother in Cinerama in Nashville, Tennessee. And I didn’t understand it all that well at that age, but now I understand that I am very much like DICK SHAWN and Dr. Fossey is like a mild-mannered version of my ETHEL MERMAN mother, for whom I’ll do anything. I am more devoted to ETHEL MERMAN than even I am to SCARLETT O’HARA!!! &quot;Word salad&quot;? These two know of what they speak ... though not necessarily what they write. Somehow or another, Kugelmass is &quot;seriously challenged&quot; by Y. T. in a category which I'm not even nominated for. (Or maybe I'm so special as to transcend mere ballots?) So vote for me! Only not over there, as it would be a shame to ruin a perfectly good echo chamber by introducing other voices.* *Young wolfson once outdid me in all of a sentence, but apparently the folks behind the Cultural Parody Center aren't fans of pithy demolitions, as the comment is nowhere to be found. I contacted wolfson to see if he remembered what he'd written, but alas, while my unfunny paraphrase &quot;sounds plausible as something I might have said [...] I don't specifically remember doing so.&quot; He then went on to answer an email I sent him two years back.</span></a></div>
