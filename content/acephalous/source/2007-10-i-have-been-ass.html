		<span id="comment-88562822-content"><p>What do you mean by a class blog? Assuming of course you&#39;re not talking about assigning a class to read a blog or blogs, which is what I was talking about. I don&#39;t think Bill is trying to pretend the world isn&#39;t changing, he&#39;s just not on the forefront of being a progressive and inventive educator and I&#39;m happy with that. I can tell Bill already struggles to decide what goes on the syllabus and what is merely banished to &quot;recommended&quot; reading. Do you really think it is a good idea to cut a Bourdieu or Derrida or Butler article in favor of having your students check out lit crit blogs and chat about them in class? I wouldn&#39;t argue that there is no value to browsing lit theory blogs but that seems like something to do on my own time outside of class. With blogs, it&#39;s a living active dialogue that virtually anyone can jump into. And simply given the nature and purpose of the medium blogs are not going to give students a chance to delve into a complex, difficult, argument written with impeccable word choice. </p>

<p>Browsing lit blogs seems like the kind of thing that I&#39;ll navigate myself when the mood strikes me and in the mean time I&#39;m glad my lit theory professor cares about nothing other than giving me a solid background that might even help me have something interesting to say once I start my own lit blog. </p>

<p>Re-reading all of this I&#39;m positive my conservative Reed education has brainwashed me. I&#39;m literally sitting here thinking &quot;what&#39;s so great about being liberal with your curriculum and embracing new things because they are new?&quot; And I&#39;m not saying that because I think you&#39;re wrong, I&#39;m saying that because I&#39;m worried I&#39;ve lost my mind.</p></span>
