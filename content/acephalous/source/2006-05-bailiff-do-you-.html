			<p><strong>Bailiff:&nbsp; </strong>Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>I do.&nbsp; (<em>Assistant District Attorney John Wells strides forward and begins to question Kaufman.</em>)</p>



<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>Is it true that on the tenth of May you wrote a post on your blog called &quot;<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/whats_the_word_.html">What's the Word I'm Looking For?&nbsp; The Opposite of 'Disgruntled'&quot;</a>?</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>I did.</p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>And did said post contain the sentence &quot;Today, for some apparent reason, I had my first choate idea in weeks&quot;?&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>It did.</p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>Now refer to Government's <a href="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:NxBAcH7rdOQJ:paul.merton.ox.ac.uk/language/gruntled.html+%22But+then,+all+at+once,+for+some+apparent+reason,+she+looked+in+my+direction+and+smiled+in+a+way+that+I+could+make+heads+and+tails+of.%22+%22The+conversation+become+more+and+more+choate,+and+we+spoke+at+length+to+much+avail.+But+I+was+defatigable,+so+I+had+to+leave+at+a+godly+hour.%22">Exhibit 643</a>.&nbsp; Read the highlighted section.</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>&quot;But then, all at once, for some apparent
reason, she looked in my direction and smiled in a way that I could make
heads and tails of.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>Notice any similarity?</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>The phrase &quot;some apparent reason&quot; appears in both.</p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>It certainly does.&nbsp; Now could you read the next highlighted part?</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>&quot;The conversation become more and
more choate, and we spoke at length to much avail.&quot;&nbsp; I know what you're thinking, but I'm no plagiarist!</p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>Will the court please instruct Mr. Kaufman to only answer the questions asked?</p>

<p><strong>Judge:&nbsp; </strong>Consider yourself warned.</p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>Thank you.&nbsp; Now please read the rest of <a href="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:NxBAcH7rdOQJ:paul.merton.ox.ac.uk/language/gruntled.html+gruntled+nomer+shevelled+kempt+godly">the highlighted words</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>Gruntled, nomer, shevelled, kempt, godly.</p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>If I were to tell you all those words appeared in your blog post of 10 May, would I be correct?</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>They're all there, but . . . </p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>You'll answer the questions I ask with a simple &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>Yes.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>The State enters Exhibit 644 into evidence.&nbsp; (<em>hands an oddly shaped box to Scott</em>)&nbsp; Mr. Kaufman, will you please tell the jury what you have in your hands?</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>A copy of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400064740/diesekoschmar-20">The Complete New Yorker</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>What would happen if I handed you a laptop and asked you to do a search for an article in the 25 July 1994 issue written be a man named Jack Winter?</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>Nothing.</p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>Nothing?&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>I stare at its outrageously complicated search interface for a couple of minutes.&nbsp; Then I'd type in his name and be taken to a screen which listed the articles he'd written.&nbsp; I'd try to access them, but would fail miserably.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>And why would you do that?</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>Because it's designed so counterintuitive that you need a doctorate in Computer Science to navigate it.</p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>You want this court to believe that someone as technological proficient as you is unable to operate <em>The Complete New Yorker</em>'s search function?</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>It's true.</p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>(<em>looking flustered</em>)&nbsp; So what you expect this court to believe is that despite you teaching articles from <em>The New Yorker </em>on a regular basis, you had no idea of the existence of Jack Winter's &quot;How I Met My Wife&quot;?</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>Yes sir.</p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>And that the numerous identical &quot;words&quot; in the two text appear through sheer coincidence?</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>Not by coincidence.&nbsp; We—Mr. Winter and I—were both aiming for the same effect.&nbsp; There aren't that many words in the English language with the strange usage patterns we both exploited for humorous effect . . . </p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>&quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; will suffice.</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>Yes then, I suppose.</p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>If a student of yours turned in an article with as many &quot;coincidences&quot; as are found in your post, what would your first reaction be?</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>It depends.&nbsp; If I'd seen them through four or five drafts and watched as they appeared via revision, I'd think it a coincidence.</p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>And what would Turnitin.com think it?</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>Plagiarism.&nbsp; But it can't account for process . . . </p>

<p><strong>Wells:&nbsp; </strong>Thank you, Mr. Kaufman.&nbsp; That's all.&nbsp; I have no more questions for this witness . . .<br /> </p>

				<p><em>Addendum</em>:&nbsp; So that turned out far more tedious than funny.&nbsp; Were I to write it more directly, I'd say &quot;I didn't actually plagiarize the Winters piece, but given the standards I apply to my students, there's no way around the fact that I'm a plagiarist.&quot;&nbsp; So when a friend of mine—who, I should add, I didn't even know read this blog—emailed me a link to the Winters article, my first thought was less thought and more terrible-sinking-feeling.&nbsp; I consoled myself with the knowledge that I didn't actually read <em>The New Yorker </em>until June of '95.&nbsp; </p>

<p>How can I date it so precisely?&nbsp; Because that's when I started working in the used bookstore which introduced me to that and many other magazines besides . . . including <em>The Baffler</em>.&nbsp; I must say that the idea that I work with people who were on <em>The Baffler</em>'s editorial board makes the young intellectual outsider in me glow in much the same way he does when the new <em>n+1 </em>arrives.&nbsp; (As it did yesterday.)&nbsp; Point being I think this an interesting test case, since I'm 100% certain I didn't plagiarize the Winters piece but know how high the evidence is stacked against me.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You should also read Gladwell&#39;s New Yorker article on plagiarism:  <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2004/2004_11_25_a_borrowed.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gladwell.com/2004/2004_11_25_a_borrowed.html</a></p>

<p>Either way, I believe you when you say &quot;coincidences&quot; and not Kaavya when she said that her blatant copying was.  </p>

<p>But you should definitely change the title!  Imagine all the people who will go to your site via googling &quot;kiss AND wild&quot; and how disappointed they will be!</p></span>

Furthermore, he noted that he charged me of plagiarism in a post about plagiarism on the same day that I got a beatdown from Fish about fish.  &quot;Did they change something in the Matrix?&quot; he asked.  Indeed!</p>

<p>Belle, not a bad idea!  Also, I read the Gladwell when it came out, and am actually teaching some of his essays next week (I think).</p>

<p>Matt, I&#39;m not at all surprised he&#39;s only got four or five posts up there in the month he&#39;s been doing it.  I&#39;m not kidding about its &quot;intuitive&quot; navigation system.</p>

<p>Kevin, I actually found that out <i>after</i> I started working with <a href="http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:00j55MXMZAQJ:www.humanities.uci.edu/fineprint/Docs/CompleteBios.doc+%22michael+szalay%22+baffler" rel="nofollow">him</a>.  I just kind of stood there, jaw-dropped, at which point he informed me that he&#39;s close friends with &quot;Tom Frank.&quot;  At which I fainted, was revived, and promptly fainted again.  (Funny how my OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG! moments only happen about self-styled public intellectuals.  I really don&#39;t know why that is.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-17228083-content"><p>So you&#39;re writing about plagiarism, and I&#39;m dealing with a case of it...  Do other people find these cases as fundamentally *depressing* as I do?  I&#39;ve got a student plagiarising things from comments on internet forums -  I was about to fail the piece for poor writing, when I realised it wasn&#39;t even this person&#39;s *own*  poor writing...  :-(</p>

<p>(I realise this has nothing to do with your main point, which is something that worries me, as well: that simple socialisation into a world of writing establishes... conceptual grooves into which thoughts more easily flow, making all writing a form of unconscious homage.  I often wince when I see large, public plagiarism controversies, wondering how many three-word fragments from my own writing might have cropped up somewhere else, in something I&#39;ve read years ago, if someone really cared to look...)</p></span>

The Opposite of &quot;Disgruntled&quot;? </strong> Searching for words costs me hours daily. Today, for some apparent reason, I had my first choate idea in weeks: Write &quot;gruntled&quot; and move along. I abused myself of the notion that placeholder words work fine. Thanks to my inelegant new nomers, searching for words became a tame goose chase. I sat there at my desk, my clothes shevelled, my hair kempt and in a state of utter array. I was completely capacitated even if my prose wasn't fully-baked. Writing became a bominable task. I was off the lam. When I advertently saw my advisor, I wore a short face and he gave me the warm shoulder. He told me I've spent my time to much avail. &quot;You've finally brought a gun to the gunfight,&quot; he said. It was concerting. I returned home and stopped working at a godly hour. And now that I look at it again, what I've written is really quite trocious. I'm at my wit's beginning now that I've bitten off only as much as I can chew. This really was an easy nut to crack once I woke up those sleeping dogs. [I blame this book for this post. Handler has a quietly self-conscious style which makes the world of words a strange place. Hence tonight's offering.]</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/caleb_crain_on_.html"><span><strong>Caleb Crain on &quot;Academic Criticism,&quot; Only Not Really</strong> [X-posted to environs Valvular.] Radiating delight, I read Caleb Crain‘s article on “Academic Criticism” in the new n+1. According to the prelude to “American Writing Today: A Symposium,” Crain’s article addresses “the conditions of production of new [academic criticism]; its character and traits; and the figures and creators who have most influenced each field” (63). It didn’t; it didn’t; and it didn’t. The article’s evident confusion may be the product of Crain (or the n+1 editors) deciding that “Academic Criticism” signals some particular body of work with addressable conditions of production, characters and traits, &amp;c. It obviously does, only Crain doesn’t address that. He reduces it to the small and vanishing genre of single-author studies. To wit: In the past few years I have become a fan—something I never dared in high school. In love with Belle &amp; Sebastian, Ben Kweller, the Decemberists, and Sufjan Stevens, I have visited band websites and subscribed to band listservs. [More evidence of fandom.] I have learned about loseless file codecs in order to trade live shows. [Even more evidence of fandom.] I have listened to songs recorded by one of my beloveds before he came up with his distinctive sound—befoe he was any good, in fact—and I have treasured them because they are, after all, his. [Even more.] I have found obscure, probably unintentional parallels between the lyrics of one beloved’s songs and those of another and I have wondered about my beloveds’ personal lives and inspected their songs for hints of autobiography. If a love of mine sings a song of another musician, I buy that musician’s album too, and try to like it. Last year, at the height of my madness, I realized what it resembled: academic literary criticism of a great author. There is the same impulse to collect and reluctance to judge. (76) Crain describes a very particular—already tenured or likely untenurable—breed of “academic critic” as representative. Very few academics truly and uncritically love the work of the writers they study. (I, for one, am frequently astonished I worked through almost all of Jack London or Silas Weir Mitchell.) There are exceptions, and they have socities, edit coterie journals and hold yearly conferences; but they by no means dominate the field, and they are often considered too indulgent to take seriously. (The jealousy? Palpable.) But how many single-author studies were published last year? How many single-author dissertations written? A chapter or an article may appear to be the product of an uncritical crush, in that it quotes letters, journal entries, and in the case of a Marianne Moore article I misplaced, grocery lists—if you’ve read Moore, you know their potential relevance—but it’s uncritical for reasons unrelated to why a Pogues fan struggles to appreciate the Nipple Erectors. (Not that much of a struggle, actually.) The uncritical fanboy has no intellectual investment in the fanboy “facts” he acquires. The scholar-squirrel acquires those facts for a reason. Crain’s analog lacks a certain, I don’t know, analogousness. But it does reveal why...</span></a></div>
