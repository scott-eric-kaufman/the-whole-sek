<p>My copy of Hardt and Negri's <em>Empire </em>has an interesting history.&nbsp; It begins in 2000, the year of its
initial publication, when Jim Ziegler (since tenure-tracked somewhere)
and I were discussing it in the &quot;TA lounge,&quot; a.k.a. the round table in
front of the graduate student mailboxes ... which the faculty use as a
short-cut between the main English department office and the primary
graduate seminar room.&nbsp; (And why shouldn't they?&nbsp; It's their
department.)&nbsp; So Jim and I are idly chatting about <em>Empire</em> when <a href="http://www.faculty.uci.edu/scripts/UCIFacultyProfiles/DetailDept.CFM?ID=2787">Julia Lupton</a> walks up, pauses, greets us, says something to Jim (I'm deaf, remember?) and then hurries off.&nbsp; (Julia's an <a href="http://web2.hnet.uci.edu/hot/">important person</a>
around UCI—a model academic whose standards I fail daily to live up
to—she's always hurrying somewhere, and with good reason.)&nbsp; Point being:

</p>

<p>Julia and Jim exchange words both assumed I could hear.&nbsp; I couldn't,
but as I often do in such situations, I nodded my head and pretended to
hear all.&nbsp; So when Jim's email arrived later that afternoon asking me
what times worked best for me, I had no clue what he was talking
about.&nbsp; I related my schedule.&nbsp; &quot;Perfect,&quot; he responded.&nbsp; &quot;I'll get
right on it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Get right on it?&quot; I thought to myself.&nbsp; &quot;Get right on what?&quot;</p>

<p>Turns out everyone rightly pegged Jim as (but mistook me for) the
resident Hardt &amp; Negri expert, and that I was now the
co-coordinator of the faculty-dominated <em>Empire </em>reading
group.&nbsp; You heard me correctly: a first year, in his second quarter,
was assumed expert enough in the Hardt &amp; Negri corpus to lead a
faculty-dominated reading group.&nbsp; (In retrospect I realize the faith
Julia placed in Jim was well-founded, and her willingness to defer to a
graduate student on the topic a sign that she practiced the
egalitarianism she preached.&nbsp; But I digress.)&nbsp; So I participated in
this reading group with Jim, Julia and a host of imposing faculty
members like Mark Poster and Andrzej Warminski.&nbsp; One of the highlights
of my first year, I tell you.<br /> </p>

<center><em>Time passes. </em></center> 

<p>The year is 2005.&nbsp; It is Spring Quarter.&nbsp; I haven't thought about <em>Empire </em>or
been all that theoretically inclined for years.&nbsp; I still own the book,
mind you, and it still overbrims with my original marginalia.&nbsp; I'm
invested in every page.&nbsp; Manic glossing.&nbsp; Attack this point here,
cheer-lead that point there.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The phone rings.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&quot;Hello?&quot; I say, assuming the voice at the other end belongs to a
machine which desires nothing more than to clean my carpet, lower my
mortgage rates or help me refinance my loans.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I'm told you have <em>Empire</em>,&quot; the voice says.&nbsp; </p>



<p>&quot;What?&nbsp; I&nbsp; have empire?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;<em>Empire</em>, <em>Empire</em>, Hardt, Negri, <em>Empire</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The book?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can I borrow it?&nbsp; Wait, hold on, you talk to him.&quot;</p>

<p>On the line now is someone who knew I helped organize the <em>Empire </em>reading
group.&nbsp; He had tried to contact Jim, but Jim had since fled Irvine for
fields criss-crossed by tracks of tenure.&nbsp; So he went to the next name
anyone knew.&nbsp; Mine.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&quot;Hi Scott.&nbsp; Spivak needs a copy of a <em>Empire </em>for her class next week and she left hers at home.&nbsp; Can she borrow yours?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure.&nbsp; Why not.&quot;</p>

<p>Later that day, my copy of <em>Empire </em>is hand-delivered to Spivak.</p>

<center><em>Time passes.</em></center>

<p>The quarter ends.&nbsp; I check my mailbox after turning in my grades, and there is my copy of <em>Empire</em>. 
No note.&nbsp; No nothing.&nbsp; Just the book in the box.&nbsp; I put it in my bag
and walk home.&nbsp; When I take it out of my bag, something falls out of
it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A postcard.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/where_do_little_books_come_from/#4570">The second strangest thing I've ever found in a book</a>.&nbsp; Written on it is the following:</p><blockquote><p>I
need to excuse myself from auditing your class, as I will need to miss
tomorrow's class.&nbsp; Which is too much to miss in a four-seek seminar. 
(I will hopefully catch up next Spring if you're back.)&nbsp; I will,
however, attend your lecture the final Friday.</p></blockquote><p>No
name.&nbsp; Signed only &quot;With warm thought.&quot;&nbsp; I think that a strange thing
to leave in a book you knew would be returned to someone else.&nbsp; I
wonder if there's anything else in the book, perhaps something more
important, something she'd like returned.&nbsp; Flipping through the pages,
I notice unfamiliar handwriting.&nbsp; Check marks.&nbsp; Exclamation points. 
Things I hadn't written.&nbsp; I start to read this new marginalia.&nbsp; Next to
a note of mine on 181 which reads &quot;empire resides in a world constantly
calls it into existence&quot; I find a giant checkmark.&nbsp; Next to the more
cryptic &quot;Hobbes: sovereignty, transcendence, representation&quot; on 84
appears &quot;What?!?&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>My marginalia has been judged.&nbsp; By Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak.&nbsp; And
been found wanting.&nbsp; I flip through the book and find a running
dialogue in the margins.&nbsp; She approves of some of comments; is baffled
by others; and on occasion scribbles corrections.&nbsp; I realize that my
copy of <em>Empire </em>has been glossed.&nbsp; Not merely glossed, but
glossed twice over, first by myself, then by Spivak.&nbsp; I wonder whether
she responds to Hardt and Negri's texts or my comments.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I wonder what she said in the seminars.&nbsp; I try to reconstruct what she said about <em>Empire </em>in
the public lectures which I had attended and which her anonymous
correspondent said he would.&nbsp; I wonder if he did.&nbsp; I wonder all of this
and realize that I was supposed to finish the two-part series on
Foucault and not prattle on and on and on about the books I would use
to do so.&nbsp; </p>

I'm only a fan because it reminds of a number of books I'd planned to read, but for whatever reason didn't. Thing is, were I to base my wish list on the blurbs provided by The Times, I wouldn't have planned to read any of them. Consider this: WINTERTON BLUE. By Trezza Azzopardi. (Grove, $24.) An unhappy young woman meets an even unhappier drifter. Two unhappy people meet for 273 pages? Quite a meeting that must've been: An Unhappy Woman: Hullo. An Even Unhappier Drifter: Hullo. An Unhappy Woman: Nice to meet you. I am an unhappy woman. An Even Unhappier Drifter: Nice to meet you too. I am an even unhappier drifter. An Unhappy Woman: How do you know you're unhappier? An Even Unhappier Drifter: Weren't you listening? An Unhappy Woman: ... An Even Unhappier Drifter: I am An Even Unhappier Drifter. Of course I know the book's better than that, but the blurb does it a disservice. In truth, every blurb on the list does its book a disservice. Not a one doesn't surrender to the effusive. (I count eight &quot;powerful&quot; somethings alone.) The compression blurbs require transform what may be decent into drab reckonings of white privilege: MY NAME IS EXOTIC TO YOU. By Exotic To You. (Smith, Johnson, White and Smith, $25) This is a powerful book about a powerful brown person who lives a powerful life in America. Not really. But ... THE BRIEF WONDROUS LIFE OF OSCAR WAO. By Junot Díaz. (Riverhead, $24.95.) A nerdy Dominican-American yearns to write and fall in love. THE RELUCTANT FUNDAMENTALIST. By Mohsin Hamid. (Harcourt, $22.) Hamid’s chilling second novel is narrated by a Pakistani who tells his life story to an unnamed American after the attacks of 9/11.</span></a></div>
