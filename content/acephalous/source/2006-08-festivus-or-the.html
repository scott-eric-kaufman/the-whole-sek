<p>While noodling around Wikipedia last night, I discovered that not only did I share <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_23">my birthday</a> with a visionaries (Nostradamus, Joseph Smith), politicians (Helmut Schmidt, “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kristol">Dan Quayle’s Brain</a>”), famous singers (Bruce Hornsby, Victoria Williams, Eddie Vedder) and a Corey (Haim)—but that it falls on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus">Festivus</a>. 
Reading this detailed account of the origin of and rituals associated
with a fictional holiday, I learned, to my surprise, that not only is
it <em>not</em> a fictional holiday, but that it’s <em>based on</em> <em>a work of high modernism</em>.&nbsp; Can you guess which one from the following description?&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGvut4zr1HI">Video is also available</a>.)
</p>
<p>
After learning of the holiday from Jerry and Elaine, Kramer calls
George’s father.&nbsp; The elder Costanza explains the holiday’s origin (<em>1:16</em>):
</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Frank</strong>: Kramer, I got your message. I haven’t celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Kramer</strong>: Well, just tell me everything, huh?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Frank</strong>: Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I
reach for the last one they had—but so did another man. As I rained
blows opon him, I realized there had to be another way!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Kramer</strong>: What happened to the doll?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Frank</strong>: It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. “A Festivus for the rest of us!&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>
And its traditions (<em>1:47</em>):
</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Frank</strong>: And at the Festivus dinner, you gather
your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have
disappointed you over the past year.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Kramer</strong>: Is there a tree?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Frank</strong>: No. Instead, there’s a pole. It requires no decoration. I find tinsel distracting.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Later, Frank and Kramer arrive at the coffee shop carrying a pole and a tape recorder.&nbsp; They approach George and Jerry (<em>3:09</em>):
</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Kramer</strong>: Well, Happy Festivus.
</p>
<p>
<strong>George</strong>: What is that? Is that the pole?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Frank</strong>: George, Festivus is your heritage—it’s part of who you are.
</p>
<p>
<strong>George</strong>: (<em>sulking</em>) That’s why I hate it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Kramer</strong>: There’s a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank’s house—everyone’s invited.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Frank</strong>: George, you’re forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (<em>Franks pushes play, George as a child celebrating Festivus is heard</em>)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Frank</strong>: Read that poem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>George</strong>: (<em>complaining</em>) I can’t read it. I need my glasses!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Frank</strong>: You don’t need glasses, you’re just weak! You’re weak!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Estelle</strong>: Leave him alone!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Frank</strong>: Alright, George. It’s time for the feats of strength.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Figured it out?&nbsp; The answer (and overlong-but-still-inadequate discussion of its significance) is below the fold.

				<p>Everyone who said <a href="http://www.msu.edu/user/sullivan/BeckettKrapp.html"><em>Krapp’s Last Tape</em></a> raise your hand.&nbsp; Figured as much.&nbsp; According to Wikipedia:
</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Seinfeld </em>writer Daniel O’Keefe’s] father, Daniel O’Keefe [Sr.], had discovered the Festivus
holiday in a book that outlined obscure (mostly European) holidays
published in 1966; the book described many of the features later
included in the <em>Seinfeld</em> episode. The father was inspired by the Samuel Beckett play <em>Krapp’s Last Tape</em>, whose protagonist tapes himself speaking at different times in his life. The original <em>Airing of Grievances</em>
was spoken into a tape recorder, and the O’Keefe family retains some of
the tapes .... The phrase “a Festivus for the rest of us” also derived
from an O’Keefe family event, the death of the elder O’Keefe’s mother.
This is not dissimilar from an Irish wake. The holiday made it onto
Seinfeld after the writing team was amused by O’Keefe’s retelling.</p></blockquote>
<p>
I’m not sure where the Irish wake factors into it, but I admit to being
curious enough to drop a dollar on a used copy of O’Keefe’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0399532293/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Real Festivus</em></a>. 
Something about the holiday seems eminently Beckettian.&nbsp; Born of an act
of senseless violence, it demands ritualistic “airing of grievances”
followed by “feats of strength.” The tortued randomness of it all, the
psychological pain inflicted for its own sake, followed by pointless
and exhausting physical exertion, reminds me of the short story “<em>Le Dépeupleur</em>“ (&quot;The Lost Ones&quot;).&nbsp; (Beckett’s own translation is among the shorts collected <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0802134904/diesekoschmar-20">here</a>.)&nbsp; The story begins:

<blockquote><p>Abode where lost bodies roam each searching for its lost
one.&nbsp; Vast enough for search to be in vain.&nbsp; Narrow enough for flight
to be in vain.&nbsp; Inside a flattened cylinder fifty metres round and
sixteen high for the sake of harmony.&nbsp; The light.&nbsp; Its dimness.&nbsp; Its
yellowness.&nbsp; Its omnipresence as though every separate square
centimetre were agleam of the some twelve million of total surface. 
Its restlessness at long intervals suddenly stilled like panting at the
last.&nbsp; Then all go dead still.&nbsp; It is perhaps the end of their abode. 
A few seconds and all begins anew. (202)</p></blockquote>
<p>
Next to “Kafkaesque,” is there any more evocative nominal adjective
(Literary Division) than “Beckettian”?&nbsp; “The Lost Ones” reads like
stage directions, thus demanding the reader visualize it as she would
any stage directions.&nbsp; (It was, in fact, <a href="http://www.irishplayography.com/search/play.asp?play_id=1765">adapted and staged</a>
in 1974.) Only thing is, as the story continues, the “stage” becomes
increasingly difficult to visualize.&nbsp; Complicating the matter even more
is the prose, in particular, the familiar slipperiness of Beckett’s
pronouns.&nbsp; “Its dimness” obviously refers to “the light,” but what
about “its restlessness”?&nbsp; The “total surface” closing the preceding
sentence has shifted the antecedent, it seems.&nbsp; The “abode”?&nbsp; That
would mean the abode moves until it is “suddenly still like panting at
the last.” </p>
<p>
Only the “all” in “then all go dead still” refers not to the people but
“their abode.” As in, “all the things in and of the abode cease
moving.” What things?&nbsp; Beckett hasn’t introduced the things which move
in the abode yet.&nbsp; So that “all” hangs, at least for a moment:
</p>
<blockquote><p>A kiss makes an indescribable sound.&nbsp; Those with stomach
still to copulate strive in vain.&nbsp; But they will not give in.&nbsp; Floor
and wall are of solid rubber or suchlike.&nbsp; Dash against them foot or
fist or head and the sound is scarcely heard.&nbsp; Imagine then the silence
of the steps.&nbsp; The only sounds worthy of the name result from the
manipulation of the ladders or the thud of bodies striking against one
another or of one against itself as when in suden fury it beats its
breast.&nbsp; The flesh and bone subsists.&nbsp; The ladders.&nbsp; They are the only
objects.&nbsp; They are single without exception and vary greatly in size. 
The shortest measure not less than six metres.&nbsp; Some are fitted with
sliding extension.&nbsp; They are propped against the wall without regard to
harmony. (203)</p></blockquote>
<p>
So, unlike “the flattened cylinder fifty metres round and sixteen high”
in which they’re “manipulated,” the ladders are propped “without regard
to harmony.” (Lest I forget again, imagine a <em>flattened</em> cylinder <em>sixteen meters tall</em> for me.&nbsp; C’mon, I <em>dare</em>
you.) So we have a harmonious cylinder outfitted with discordant
ladders of different sizes and capabilities filled with people vainly
striving to copulate in dead silence ... except for the sounds of the
ladders, the people climbing them or the vigorous displays of
masculinity.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Sounds like an episode of <em>Seinfeld</em> to me.&nbsp; <em>Thematically</em>, of course.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Addendum</strong>: I may follow this post with a more searching analysis of “<em>Le Dépeupleur</em>,”
as it’s one of my favorite Beckett shorts.&nbsp; (I hesitated calling it a
“story” above, but who wants to write “short prose piece” again and
again and again?) Here I merely wanted to point to the strange way in
which Beckett’s sensibility has crept into mainstream culture.

Who's shuffling my shuffler? (The Devil, silly.) That explains it. So, with a heavier-than-anticipated heart, I present my Friday Random Ten ... on Thursday, because I can: Bruce Springsteen, &quot;The River&quot; [.mp3] What can I say? I'm a Jersey boy and this song breaks my heart. It'll break yours too. If it doesn't, Rosie the Riveter just put you on her list. The Band, &quot;Look Out Cleveland&quot; [.mp3] Two songs in a row about towns blowing away. Mother of ... stop. (Hammer Time?) No. But I'll take a page from his ministerial book and repeat things really, really hard until I think they're true: You believe in the power of positive thinking. You believe in the power of positive thinking. You believe in the power of positive thinking. (Do you?) No, but I have another idea. I love game shows. Just like faith, only with prizes. Another approach, then: C'mon now! Big money, big money, no whammies, big money ... Wilco, &quot;Kamera (Take Two)&quot; [.mp3] Big money! The inevitable Wilco song and/or demo. Given the ratio of Wilco to non-Wilco tracks on my iRiver, the odds of a Wilco appearance on a &quot;Random Ten&quot; are, um, how 'bout we leave it at &quot;good&quot;? This take's a happier, if harder, of the YHF gem. C'mon now! Big money, big money, no whammies, big money ... Big Star, &quot;Kangaroo&quot; [.mp3] Whammy! The Whammy King, really. Boy howdy, does anything depress a body more than the sound of Alex Chilton's sanity dissolving while the tape keeps running? (At least the peppier depression of, say, &quot;O Dana&quot; [.mp3] could've popped up.) So much for pressing my luck. I'll take &quot;Happy Songs That Make Scott Happy&quot; for $400, Alex ... Soul Asylum, &quot;Cartoon&quot; [.mp3] Sorry, what? Oh, forgot, the form of a question. &quot;What is proof that a band can release a greatest hits album which contains exactly one song representative of their best work?&quot; &quot;Happy Songs That Make Scott Happy&quot; for $600, Alex ... What is Matthew Sweet's &quot;Devil With the Green Eyes&quot; [.mp3]? Not cool, Alex, not cool. This ain't &quot;Depressing Songs Proudly Depressing Scott Since 1993.&quot; It's &quot;Happy Songs That Make Scott Happy.&quot; You're lucky I don't have lasers, punk. (But you do.) Not here. You and I? We're through, Trebek. Pat, I'd like to solve the puzzle ... The Pogues, &quot;Danny Boy&quot; [.mp3] &quot;Danny Boy,&quot; Pat? The version sung for John Peel in 1984, before Shane became the man, er, man-boy he is today? You're killing me, Pat. Killing me. I should've stuck with the Canuck. No more game shows for Y.T. No Pat, I don't want to buy a vowel, I'd rather blow my brains out with a pistol up my arse...</span></a></div>
