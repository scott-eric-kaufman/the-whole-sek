        <meta name="description" content="(x-p-p-p-posted .) On this day in 1920, Frank Herbert Jr. was born. Herbert devoted six years to “researching” what would become the most popular science fiction novel of all time. I’ve always wondered what counts as “research” when writing a novel. I can understand the need for writers of hard science fiction to familiarize themselves with the ins and outs of a particular field, but for someone like Herbert, wouldn’t “world-building” more accurately describe his efforts? I say this because Herbert describes a world in which the mysticism and magic have replaced science and technology. This time I am lifting from Adam Robert‘s excellent History of Science Fiction, in which he claims “one of the book’s greatest strengths is its detailed and plausible rendering of the political context” (236). What Herbert spent six years “researching,” then, was the complex political environs of the interplanetary empire he’d invented because Dune‘s reputation as an environmental novel is undeserved. The overgrown extremophiles who inhabit Arrakis are humans from Earth, but somehow survive on a planet with no viable means to create or sustain an atmosphere. As Roberts writes: We may wonder, for instance, how Dune’s atmosphere is oxygenated in the absence of planetary vegetation. In later books Herbert suggests that the sandworms fart oxygen, which hardly address the problem. Indeed, without an atmospheric density in the neighborhood of 1.2 kg/m³ it wouldn’t matter what element those sandworms farted--it would’ve drifted up and away. And where did all that sand come from anyway? The most efficient means of producing sand is wave action, but even if Herbert wanted to be inefficient, a little research would’ve taught him that sand requires big rocks and weathering processes. The geological history of a planet consisting entirely of sand is--will you let me get my geology geek on, please? The opportunities to do so are few and very far between. Fine then.

</p>
<p>
This time I am <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/07/i-wish-that-son-of-a-gun-would-take-that-other-hand-out-of-his-pocket/#comment-14389">lifting from</a> <a href="http://www.adamroberts.com/">Adam Robert</a>‘s excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0333970225/diesekoschmar-20"><em>History of Science Fiction</em></a>,
in which he claims “one of the book’s greatest strengths is its
detailed and plausible rendering of the political context” (236).&nbsp; What
Herbert spent six years “researching,” then, was the complex political
environs of the interplanetary empire he’d invented because <em>Dune</em>‘s reputation as an environmental novel is undeserved.&nbsp; The overgrown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile">extremophiles</a> who inhabit <a href="http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Arrakis">Arrakis</a> are <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/T-Bone+Burnett/_/Humans+From+Earth">humans from Earth</a>, but somehow survive on a planet with no viable means to create or sustain an atmosphere.&nbsp; As Roberts writes:

very far between.&nbsp; Fine then.&nbsp; I’ll be mysterious.*
</p>
<p>
I don’t mean to diminish Herbert’s accomplishments in <em>Dune</em>. 
So long as he was alive, the series educated science types about the
nuances and niceties of medieval politics.&nbsp; (The process, if not the
history.) That said, I always found Herbert’s forecast of future
history more than a little pessimistic.&nbsp; Like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_%28franchise%29"><em>Terminator</em></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JNTR/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Battlestar Galactica</em></a> franchises, the <em>Dune</em> sextet pivots on <a href="http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Thinking_machines">a war between man and formerly enslaved machine</a>, the result of which was a return to a pre-computational society.&nbsp; The <a href="http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Mentat">mentats</a> are bred--&quot;<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/the_best_quotat.html">Fancy meeting you here, dissertation</a>. 
Please GO AWAY.&quot;--they are bred to be mathematical savants, and spice
mystically allows for interstellar travel sans star-charts.&nbsp; So, no
computers needed.&nbsp; However, Herbert’s novels seem to argue that a
rejection of the modern technology entails a rejection of modern
political systems--as if dispensing with the convenience of a
calculator is the first sign of feudalism’s revival.
</p>
<p>Besides the obvious problem with this--somehow those Athenians
managed to be quasi-democratic before the Age of Apple--and despite
Herbert’s obvious critique of hierarchy and messianic thought, I can’t
help but think the novels engender a nostalgia for certainty in their
readers.&nbsp; We might not know how spice works, but Our Dear <a href="http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Leto_Atreides_II#Reign_of_Leto_II">God-Emperor</a>
surely does.&nbsp; (Despite having personally and purposely evolved into a
human-sandworm hybrid--about which plot-point my dissertation rears its
head like <a href="http://www.michaelberube.com/images/uploads/zzzputin.jpg">Giant Putin over unsuspecting Alaska</a>. 
So I’ll stop now lest I invite insanity in, slap it on the back, and
offer it a brew--which is, yes, how a body feels about a dissertation
recently completed.&nbsp; I hear tell this subsides in time, but so far I’ve
felt none of it.)
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>*<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">By which I don’t mean anything
like “I sat here trying to think what would have to happen for such a
planet to come about--including, but not limited to, a cessation of
mountain-building after a period of intense weathering by something
other than water, since <a href="http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Sandworm#Water_Poisoning">water poisons</a> the marvelous beasts who produce the <a href="http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Spice_melange">spice melange</a>
and whose evolution would’ve spanned untold eons.” I don’t mean
anything like that.&nbsp; I know the answer, I’m simply not in the mood to
share.</span></p>

<p>Reading SF posts here, the Valve, etc., I always wonder whether I should try reading the book myself.  This time I&#39;m genuinely unsure what you think of it, other than that it&#39;s a book SF readers will already have read.</p>

<p>These are the Alps. What is there to say about them?<br />
They don&#39;t make sense. Fatal glaciers, crags cranks climb,<br />
jumbled boulder and weed, pasture and boulder, scree,<br />
<i>et l&#39;on entend</i>, maybe, <i>le refrain joyeux et leger</i>.<br />
Who knows what the ice will have scraped on the rock it is smoothing?<br />
There they are, you will have to go a long way round if you want to avoid them.<br />
It takes some getting used to. There are the Alps,<br />
fools! Sit down and wait for them to crumble!<br />

<p><i>without an atmospheric density in the neighborhood of 1.2 kg/m³ it wouldn’t matter what element those sandworms farted--it would’ve drifted up and away.</i></p>

<p>This is not true.</p>

<p>Not sure about your point on the unlikeliness of sand: Arrakis has all the ingredients, viz. 1) rock 2) wind. Why shouldn&#39;t it end up covered by sand? <br />
There&#39;s also the other plot point that the Magical Plot-Supporting Oxygen-Farting Skyhook Worms are supposed to have sequestered all the water too...<br />

		<span id="comment-137072319-content"><p>&quot;However, Herbert’s novels seem to argue that a rejection of the modern technology entails a rejection of modern political systems--as if dispensing with the convenience of a calculator is the first sign of feudalism’s revival. &quot;</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time tripping on his idea of seeing the future, a path for civilization, that he couldn&#39;t change. He wanted to bring an end to this, leading him on the &quot;Golden path&quot; the only way to break out of a predetermined pattern which might lead to ideas of revolution, growth and decay, and phases of the said government systems. </p></span>

Just ask Sen. McCain, who tonight said: Now, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaeda and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support. We could give him the benefit of the doubt, but what incentive do we have to do so? I mean, Obama can't speak without st--st--stuttering were it not for his tele--tele--(the gag's done gassed)--prompter. However, if we were in McCain's camp, this would be proof positive that Ayers was the tip of the terrorist iceberg.</span></a></div>

I get email.* I did not attend the second class and was supposed to be dropped automatically due to the second day rule, but I have to officially drop the course with your signature. When are you on campus today? This student is gently reminded that I told the class on the first day that the second day rule is not automatic, informed that I will not be on campus today and directed to the composition office. I get more email: I was wondering if there was any room in your 39B class from 9:30-10:50 a.m. I've been trying to get into a class and it seems like they're completely full! This student is politely informed that I only allow two unexcused absences per quarter, and that because my class has already met four times, it would be impossible for her to earn a passing grade. I get even more email: i need to add ur class wheres ur office so u can sign my add card This student is also informed that I only allow two unexcused absences per quarter, and that because my class has already met four times, it would be impossible for him to earn a passing grade. He responds: i can get excuses I want to inform him that I'm not sure how he can be absent in a course in which he isn't enrolled, but fear the inevitable literalism of his reply. (&quot;i wuznt there but have doctors note&quot;) So I tell him that I only allow four total absences because that amounts to twenty percent of the entire course, and a student who misses twenty percent of a course cannot earn a passing grade. He responds: i make up the work r u in ur office now I turn off the computer and re-read the material I'm teaching next week. He responds: wheres ur office to sign my card I compose study questions for my students. The computer is still off. He responds: need to no where ur office is to sign card soon I eat lunch. He responds: fine i dont hear from u soon u reget it I consider responding to ask what I'll get again, but needn't have bothered. He sent me a link. (And yet, I still miss love teaching, even though this happens every quarter.) *No actual students were harmed in the composition of this post. (But some of their stylistic tics may've been reproduced and mocked.)</span></a></div>
