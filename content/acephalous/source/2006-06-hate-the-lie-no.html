		<span id="comment-18911169-content"><p>What I said over at Piny&#39;s:</p>

<p>I was just going to toss Faulkner out there. Benjy is definitely unreliable.  </p>

<p>And since my field is poetry, I&#39;m also gonna toss out just about every narrator in The Canterbury Tales. </p>

<blockquote>Should we differentiate between narrators who know they’re unreliable and are trying to hoodwink their audience (Fight Club) and those who don’t and are being hoodwinked by their author (Lolita)?</blockquote>

<blockquote>I think the way to tell if a narrator is unreliable is to ask if it’s a 1st person narrator. If so, he’s unreliable by definition.</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m inclined to agree with Amanda, but I need to wrinkle further:</p>

<p>How does one handle narrators that <em>don&#39;t know</em> they are unreliable and it&#39;s also apparent that they author is <em>not trying</em> to hoodwink the narrator? &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; comes to mind. I&#39;d be hard-pressed to come up with an argument that the narrator is unreliable in this instance. Are there levels of unreliablity? Is there a point where one understands that theoretically a narrator is unreliable, but for interpretive reasons it&#39;s absurd to argue that the narrator is unreliable? </p>

<p>Also, what about 3rd person narration? There&#39;s always &quot;An Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge.&quot;</p></span>

		<span id="comment-19066153-content"><p>I tend to think that Benjy is not so much unreliable as encoded. For example, once you figure out that the world moves rather than he, it is easy to convert his language into the normal speech of an ambulatory person. He has an unusual and blurred perceptual apparatus, rather than an agenda. </p>

<p>Between Tyler Durden and Humbert Humbert, I see more similarities than differences, though I quite agree that they differ according to their level of self-awareness.</p>

<p>Their most important similarity is as follows: both of them are unreliable [i]in order to be reliable[/i]. The narrator of Fight Club is unreliable about the existence of Tyler Durden, but only insofar as Tyler is presented as a separate person. This makes possible the much more shocking realization that the narrator is capable of being Tyler (instead of merely worshipping him), because [i]he is Tyler[/i]. This raises wonderful questions about the influence of others on our notions of the limits of our identity. </p>

<p>Likewise, the problem with Humbert Humbert is not, as we would expect, that he is sleeping with a little girl. Up to a point, his love affair with her is thrilling, sexy, and sympathetic. (If you don&#39;t agree with this, or couldn&#39;t possibly agree with this, then I never want to hear you say that the book is beautifully written, because the engine of that lyricism is Lo.) The problem is that the pedophile is a jealous egoist who robs her of a childhood -- but [i]not because he has sex with her![/i] He is reprehensible because he won&#39;t let her play with her friends, or listen to her favorite music, or do the other things she wants. The fact that the life she wants is miserable and banal does not make it his to deny.</p>

<p>Thus Nabokov undermines our conventional reaction to pedophilia, only to re-establish it through a critique with much wider implications. Most of us don&#39;t fall in love with children. Few of us are as passionate as Humbert, though, and few of us are any better than he at accepting the freedom of the people we love. </p></span>

It is second only to a rubber duck as the ideal bathtub companion. It may be held in the hand without causing muscular fatigue or nerve strains, it may be neatly balanced back of the faucets, and it may be read through before the water has cooled. And if it slips down the drain pipe, all right, it slip down the drain pipe. When I was a teacher—all of last week ago—I used this paragraph as an example of how you can effectively violate the &quot;laws&quot; of grammar. Back in the day I would stress how one must internalize such laws before one breaks them, and students always reacted favorably to Parker's masterful comma splices. They convinced themselves that they too could be the ones who were the ones who did it well. Some of them even were.</span></a></div>

Thing is, when medievalists tip-toe into the 15th Century, they’re often paralyzed by the unfamiliar literary landscape. “Whither my rigid poetic forms? And feudalism! What have you people done with feudalism?” Medievalists are confused, nay, mortified by the shiny baubles and the steam which periodically issues from them. So sometimes they need us soon-to-be-unemployed/forever-unemployable modern-types after all, like when they want to write a syllabus on “The Poetry of Crisis.” Below the fold you’ll find The Little Womedievalist’s skeletal syllibi. Lots of war, lots of plague. The word “pandemic” appears no less than seventeen times. She’d appreciate any advice that’ll help her “flesh it out.” (O how quickly our dead metaphors are enlivened!) Here (in no particular order) are the topics she wants to address: Irish potato famine WWII Vietnam War Influenza pandemic of 1918 Revolutionary War French Revolution (poems written in English) AIDS pandemic Cold War/ Communist Scare/ McCarthy States of anarchy/ regime changes Great Depression (I only have Agee and Evans so far…) Current “war on terror”/ Iraq/ Afghanistan/ post-9/11 Any other major political/social/religous crises Here is what she has so far: Weeks 1 – 3 (Social and political crises) William Blake - “The Tyger,” ; Selections from Prophet Against Empire (David Erdman) Middle English Plowman poems Agee and Evans, selections from “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men”; background reading on the Great Depression “Tax Hath Tenet Us Alle” (Short ME macaronic poem) “Introduction” from The Penguin Book of First World War Poetry, ed. and intro by Jon Silkin (on reserve). [Though we won’t be covering all of the poets discussed in Silkin’s intro, this will outline a number of the critical questions and issues we want to ask about the poems we will be reading during weeks 4 and 5.] Weeks 4 &amp; 5 (War, Rebellion, Unrest, Protest) Michael Drayton, “The Battle of Agincourt” (ERP 261) Milton, “On the Late Massacre in Piedmont” (Background Reading.)
