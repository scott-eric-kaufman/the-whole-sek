		<span id="comment-109712238-content"><p>I&#39;m no Twain expert, but news of his growing pessimism seems exaggerated.  I just finished *Innocents Abroad*, and you really cannot find a more humanity-hating book than that.  Kafka at least thought that art could defrost the ice in our hearts.  Even early on, Twain thought every thing around him dirty, corrupt, base, and overrated.  (It&#39;s worse when Twain tries to work up some affection for the world around him.  Unconvincing enthusiasm makes me more uncomfortable than simple satire.)</p>

		<span id="comment-109716902-content"><p>If you actually like Twain and want to read Twainesque works, try Jaroslav Hašek (best known for <i>The Good Soldier Schweik</i>, but a number of his hundreds of Twainesque stories and sketches have been translated.)</p>

<p>If you do <i>not</i> like Twain, do <i>not</i> read Hašek. It&#39;s a fairly simple algorithm. </p>

<p>Knut Hamsun also was influenced by Twain. In turn he influenced Joyce, who had learned Dano-Norwegian to read the unendurably tedious Ibsen. </p>

<p>Both Hamsun and Hašek spent time as tramps. Whether this was an indigenous European tramp tradition or something they learned from Twain, I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>Hamsun was also a serious racist and eventual Nazi collaborator. Probably a Social Darwinist of some sort.</p>

<p>Hasek was not especially pessimistic, but was totally without hope except during his short Bolshevik phase, which took him as far as Mongolia. The Austro-Hungarians metabolism did not require hope. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-109770496-content"><p>Dude, you can&#39;t understand Twain&#39;s pessimism without understanding what he wrote about his riverboat captaincy:</p>

<p>&quot;What does the lovely flush in a beauty&#39;s cheek mean to a doctor but a &#39;break&#39; that ripples above some deadly disease.  Are not all her visible charms sown thick with what are to him the signs and symbols of hidden decay? Does he ever see her beauty at all, or doesn&#39;t he simply view her professionally, and comment upon her unwholesome condition all to himself?  And doesn&#39;t he sometimes wonder whether he has gained most or lost most by learning his trade?&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s Twain&#39;s self-image, right there.  The writer-doctor who has trained himself to see people -- just like Kafka was the land surveyor for God -- and sees symptoms of disease everywhere.</p>

<p>No doubt I&#39;m just inadvertently repeating now something that must be a standard feature of analysis of one of Kafka&#39;s most analysed works, but the &quot;Fuck me I&#39;m a bug&quot; thing goes beyond pessimism to unfortunate further depths with the repeated times in the Metamorphosis when his father is shoving or hurting him from behind.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-109787094-content"><p>Luther:</p>

<p><em>I&#39;m no Twain expert, but news of his growing pessimism seems exaggerated. I just finished *Innocents Abroad*, and you really cannot find a more humanity-hating book than that.</em></p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between his early, mannered misanthropy and the pervasive pessimism in his late work.  Dan will no doubt smack me for <a href="http://noggs.typepad.com/the_reading_experience/2008/04/yasmin-alibhai.html" rel="nofollow">saying as much</a>, but if you check out his letters the difference becomes obvious.  You&#39;re right to say that the public persona -- the perpetual disappointment in the affairs of men, &amp;c. -- might not have changed so much, but behind the scenes, he seems to have become the character he once played.</p>

<p>John, </p>

<p>I read Hašek years ago, before I&#39;d read more of Twain than <em>Huck Finn</em> in high school, so I&#39;ve never made the connection before.  That said, we ought to update its singularly horrible Wikipedia entry:</p>

<blockquote>Jaroslav Hašek and in particular this novel have been subjects of innumerable articles, essays, studies, and books. Written by a great variety of individuals, ranging from friends and acquaintances, to admirers, detractors, and literary scholars (an insightful essay here), they started appearing almost immediately after the publication of the unfinished novel and the author&#39;s premature death in 1923.</blockquote>

<p>The &quot;insightful essay&quot; in question is linked at the bottom of the page as, yes, an &quot;insightful essay.&quot;  Here&#39;s a bit about the translations:</p>

<blockquote>The first two translations actually do very little for the book due probably to a variety of reasons.</blockquote>

<p>The quoted sentences actually do very little for the quality of the translation due probably to a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>Sisyphus:</p>

<p><em>After all, you would be the paradigmatic case of an incurable optimist ...</em></p>

<p>Actually, I just made a promise to myself not to cry in public and have, for the most part, kept it.</p>

<p>Rich:</p>

<p><em>the &quot;Fuck me I&#39;m a bug&quot; thing goes beyond pessimism to unfortunate further depths with the repeated times in the Metamorphosis when his father is shoving or hurting him from behind.</em></p>

<p>Someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong -- Patrick, you were there, weren&#39;t you? -- but I think Vonnegut followed that up with a pregnant pause, then &quot;from there it was all downhill.&quot;  The bottomless abyss, and all, being the Jew&#39;s lot.</p></span>

how does it feel to cry in public, i never ever cried in public, must be very liberating<br />
pessimism still has some energy, even if negative<br />
what is impossible, well, i mean difficult to fight within self is apathy and indifference</p></span>
