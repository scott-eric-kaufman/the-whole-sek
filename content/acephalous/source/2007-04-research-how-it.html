He is so very, very wrong. I now present an excerpt from London’s play The First Poet, collected in The Turtles of Tasman. The scene: The hill nearest to the plain terminates in a cliff, in the face of which, nearly at the level of the ground, are four caves, with low, narrow entrances. Before the caves, and distant from them less than one hundred feet, is a broad, flat rock, on which are laid several sharp slivers of flint, which, like the rock, are blood-stained. Between the rock and the cave-entrances, on a low pile of stones, is squatted a man, stout and hairy. Across his knees is a thick club, and behind him crouches a woman. At his right and left are two men somewhat resembling him, and like him, bearing wooden clubs ... It is late afternoon. The name of him on the pile of stones is Uk, the name of his mate, Ala; and of those at his right and left, Ok and Un. Uk: Be still! (turning to the woman behind him) Thou seest that they become still. None save me can make his kind be still, except perhaps the chief of the apes, when in the night he deems he hears a serpent.... At whom dost thou stare so long? At Oan? Oan, come to me! Oan: I am thy cub. Uk: Oan, thou art a fool! Ok and Un: Ho! ho! Oan is a fool! All the Tribe: Ho! ho! Oan is a fool! Oan: Why am I a fool? Uk: Dost thou not chant strange words? Last night I heard thee chant strange words at the mouth of thy cave. Oan: Ay! They are marvellous words; they were born within me in the dark. Uk: Art thou a woman, that thou shouldst bring forth? Why dost thou not sleep when it is dark? Oan: I did half sleep; perhaps I dreamed. Don’t leave! The cavemen haven’t even discussed the danger of non-literal speech yet: Oan: They are wonderful words. They are such: The bright day is gone— Uk: Now I see thou art liar as well as fool: behold, the day is not gone! Oan: But the day was gone in that hour when my song was born to me. Uk: Then shouldst thou have sung it only at that time, and not when it is yet day. But beware lest thou awaken me in the night. Make thou many stars, that they fly in the whiskers of Gurr. Did I forget to introduce Gurr? He’s a tiger. You heard me right. The danger of non-literal speech is being eaten by a tiger. Not to mentio—LOOK OUT! O men! O men with the heart of hyenas! Behold, Gurr cometh not! I did but strive to deceive you, that I might the more easily...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/04/i_want_our_boys.html"><span><strong>I Want Our Boys in the Van</strong> Life would be so much easier if I had them. Imagine my job talk: Q: So what do you think the implications of this are for a Deleuzian discourse which rejects anagenetic in favor of a more rhizomatic cladogenetic theory of the dissemination of ideas in the body social? A: Off the top of my head, I'm not sure. I'll have our boys in the van look into it and get back to you on that one. To get back to topic of my talk, I think [many brilliant things about the impact of evolutionary theory on turn-of-the-last-century American culture, and I relate them for approximately five minutes] ... could the gentlemen who asked the question about Deleuze please stand up? So, one of the boys in the van is telling me that he wouldn't be so quick to align Deleuzian thought with cladogenetic accounts. He's saying cladogenetic and anagenetic accounts are often complementary, inasmuch as the changes of the frequency of traits within a population (anagenesis) is what eventually causes speciation (cladogenesis). He's also informed me that the word &quot;cladogenesis&quot; means &quot;the origins of branches.&quot; Tim McCarver: I did not know that. I would have said &quot;trees,&quot; but that would have to be seeds, which you plant in the ground. Amazing what boys can dig up in the van these days.</span></a></div>
