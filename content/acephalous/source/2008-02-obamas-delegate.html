Poking around the site, I noticed a link to joshsisk.com on the blog-roll and thought: &quot;I (sort of) knew a Josh Sisk in high school.&quot; I clicked through and to his &quot;about me&quot; page and wouldn't you know? Same Josh Sisk I (sort of) knew in high school. He mentions having another blog and, stalker I am, I click through. Only his other blog isn't his alone: it's a group-blog that includes a number of other people I (sort of) knew in high school (as well as one person I considered a close friend). Not to be an alarmist here, but I BELIEVE THE INTERNETS IS SHRINKING. Soon the day will come when everyone you ever knew knows you again. Your hated rivals will link to your profile on HatedRivals.com. Elementary school bullies will link post about the beatings they delivered on IOnceKickedHisAss.com and fellow bullies will rate them. You will all be Facebook friends. We will all be Facebook friends. So it is written. So it has been foretold.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/02/im-a-self-impor.html"><span><strong>I'm a Self-Important Prick, I Know, I Know</strong> Tomemos sent me an email yesterday saying I had a package waiting for me in front of the departmental mailboxes. Given that I've checked my box once in the past three months, this comes as no surprise. He also told me it was &quot;accumulating jokes,&quot; which, sincere fool I am, I'd looked forward to reading. The first two cracked me up: &quot;Recommended to publish, conditional on addition of more emoticons.&quot; — A. Winter, Review Board &quot;Nice article thanks for sharing.&quot; — Buy Prescriptions Now The third one, however, struck me somewhat differently: &quot;You're a self-important prick, we know, we know, so pick up you're [sic] mail already, ass.&quot; — The Department I've a feeling &quot;The Department&quot; ain't coterminous with my department, but that someone would be possessed to write that, even jokingly, disturbs me. I know you're tired of hearing about how I don't consider myself any great shakes ... how I think I've been artificially elevated to some undeserved position on the beastly two-head back of some horny undergrads ... how I'm likely as not to be a nobody two years from now no matter what others think. But my stomach turns when I hear that people think me self-important. Have they not read a thing I've written or listened to a word I've said? Do they assume it's all an act? That in private I puff my chest in pride of all I've not-yet-but-will-one-day-surely accomplish? I'm at a loss. If you know me and think my insecurities obscure an inner braggart, I don't think you know me as well as you think you do. I'm not more; and if it's what I do that defines me, let the record show I'm well-nigh amorphous.</span></a></div>
