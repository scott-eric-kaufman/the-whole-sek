        <meta name="description" content="I’m just a teacher of argument, not a lawyer, so I’m only going to address the merits of these arguments on their merits, not their legal standing. To begin: JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Cooper, could I just understand your argument. In reading the briefs, it seems as though your principal argument is that same-sex and opposite—opposite-sex couples are not similarly situated because opposite-sex couples can procreate, same-sex couples cannot, and the State’s principal interest in marriage is in regulating procreation. Is that basically correct? MR. COOPER: I—Your Honor, that’s the essential thrust of our—our position, yes. JUSTICE KAGAN: Is—is there—so you have sort of a reason for not including same-sex couples. Is there any reason that you have for excluding them? In other words, you’re saying, well, if we allow same-sex couples to marry, it doesn’t serve the State’s interest. But do you go further and say that it harms any State interest? MR. COOPER: Your Honor, we—we go further in—in the sense that it is reasonable to be very concerned that redefining marriage to—as a genderless institution could well lead over time to harms to that institution and to the interests that society has always—has—has always used that institution to address. But, Your Honor, I— JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, could you explain that a little bit to me, just because I did not pick this up in your briefs. What harm you see happening and when and how and—what—what harm to the institution of marriage or to opposite-sex couples, how does this cause and effect work? MR. COOPER: Once again, I—I would reiterate that we don’t believe that’s the correct legal question before the Court, and that the correct question is whether or not redefining marriage to include same-sex couples would advance the interests of marriage as a— JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then are—are you conceding the point that there is no harm or denigration to traditional opposite-sex marriage couples? So you’re conceding that. MR. COOPER: No, Your Honor, no. I’m not conceding that. JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but, then it—then it seems to me that you should have to address Justice Kagan’s question. MR. COOPER: Thank you, Justice Kennedy. I have two points to make on them. The first one is this: The Plaintiffs’ expert acknowledged that redefining marriage will have real-world consequences, and that it is impossible for anyone to foresee the future accurately enough to know exactly what those real-world consequences would be. And among those real-world consequences, Your Honor, we would suggest are adverse consequences. Cooper argues, not in essence, but is actually forwarding the argument that redefining marriage will have real-world consequences that are impossible for anyone to predict, but which include the adverse ones he knows will happen. Cooper fails freshmen composition. But what are his real concerns? MR. COOPER: Yes, Your Honor.

			<p>I’m just a teacher of argument, not a lawyer, so I’m only going to 
address the merits of these arguments on their merits, not their legal 
standing. To begin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>JUSTICE  KAGAN:</strong> Mr. Cooper, could I just
 understand your argument. In reading  the briefs, it seems as though 
your principal argument is that same-sex  and opposite—opposite-sex 
couples are not similarly situated because  opposite-sex couples can 
procreate, same-sex couples cannot, and the  State’s principal interest 
in marriage is in regulating procreation. Is  that basically correct?</p>
<p><strong>MR. COOPER:</strong> I—Your Honor, that’s the essential thrust of our—our position, yes.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTICE KAGAN:</strong> Is—is there—so you have sort of a 
reason for not  including same-sex couples. Is there any reason that you
 have for  excluding them? In other words, you’re saying, well, if we 
allow  same-sex couples to marry, it doesn’t serve the State’s interest.
 But do  you go further and say that it harms any State interest?</p>
<p><strong>MR.  COOPER: </strong>Your Honor, we—we go further in—in the 
sense that it is  reasonable to be very concerned that redefining 
marriage to—as a  genderless institution could well lead over time to 
harms to that  institution and to the interests that society has 
always—has—has always  used that institution to address. But, Your 
Honor, I—</p>
<p><strong>JUSTICE  KAGAN:</strong> Well, could you explain that a 
little bit to me, just because I  did not pick this up in your briefs. 
What harm you see happening and  when and how and—what—what harm to the 
institution of marriage or to  opposite-sex couples, how does this cause
 and effect work?</p>
<p><strong>MR.  COOPER:</strong> Once again, I—I would reiterate that we
 don’t believe that’s the  correct legal question before the Court, and 
that the correct question  is whether or not redefining marriage to 
include same-sex couples would  advance the interests of marriage as a—</p>
<p><strong>JUSTICE KENNEDY:</strong> Well,  then are—are you conceding 
the point that there is no harm or  denigration to traditional 
opposite-sex marriage couples? So you’re  conceding that.</p>
<p><strong>MR. COOPER:</strong> No, Your Honor, no. I’m not conceding that.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTICE KENNEDY:</strong> Well, but, then it—then it seems to me that you should have to address Justice Kagan’s question.</p>
<p><strong>MR. COOPER:</strong> Thank you, Justice Kennedy. I have two 
points to make on  them. The first one is this: The Plaintiffs’ expert 
acknowledged that  redefining marriage will have real-world 
consequences, and that it is  impossible for anyone to foresee the 
future accurately enough to know  exactly what those real-world  
consequences would be. And among those  real-world consequences, Your 
Honor, we would suggest are adverse  consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cooper argues, not in essence, <em>but is actually forwarding the argument </em>that
 redefining marriage  will have real-world consequences that are 
impossible for anyone to  predict, but which include the adverse ones he
 knows will happen. Cooper fails freshmen composition. But what are his 
real concerns?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MR.  COOPER: </strong>Yes, Your Honor. The 
concern is that redefining marriage as a  genderless institution will 
sever its abiding connection to its historic  traditional procreative 
purposes, and it will refocus, refocus the  purpose of marriage and the 
definition of marriage away from the raising  of children and to the 
emotional needs and desires of adults, of adult  couples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People might seek to meet the “emotional needs and desires of adults,
 of adult couples”? Why would the gays want the emotional needs and 
desires of <em>all </em>adult couples to be met? What did they ever do to them? Who really matters here anyway?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>JUSTICE  KAGAN:</strong> Well, suppose a State 
said, Mr. Cooper, suppose a State said  that, Because we think that the 
focus of marriage really should be on  procreation, we are not going to 
give marriage licenses anymore to any  couple where both people are over
 the age of 55. Would that be constitutional?<br id=".reactRoot[315].[1][2][1]{comment10101654502829921_17180024}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0.[1]" /><br id=".reactRoot[315].[1][2][1]{comment10101654502829921_17180024}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0.[2]" /><strong>MR. COOPER:</strong> No, Your Honor, it would not be constitutional.<br id=".reactRoot[315].[1][2][1]{comment10101654502829921_17180024}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0.[4]" /><br id=".reactRoot[315].[1][2][1]{comment10101654502829921_17180024}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0.[5]" /><strong>JUSTICE  KAGAN:</strong>
 Because that’s the same State interest, I would think, you know.  If 
you are over the age of 55, you don’t help us serve the Government’s  
interest in regulating procreation through marriage. So why is that  
different?<br id=".reactRoot[315].[1][2][1]{comment10101654502829921_17180024}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0.[7]" /><br id=".reactRoot[315].[1][2][1]{comment10101654502829921_17180024}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0.[8]" /><strong>MR.  COOPER: </strong>Your
 Honor, even with respect to couples over the age of 55, it  is very 
rare that both couples—both parties to the couple are  infertile, and 
the traditional—<br id=".reactRoot[315].[1][2][1]{comment10101654502829921_17180024}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0.[10]" /><br id=".reactRoot[315].[1][2][1]{comment10101654502829921_17180024}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0.[11]" />(Laughter.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The men. <em>Of course</em>. The men matter here, because they’re the
 ones who can continue to be fertile in perpetuity. So the emotional
 needs and desires of couples are less important to Cooper than the government’s 
commitment to protect the inalienable rights of viable sperm. But I’m 
sure there’s no precedent about marriage and its effect on children that
 might be relevant here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>GENERAL VERRILLI: </strong>Well, they might try 
to make a different record about  the effects on children. But there 
isn’t a record to that effect here.  And the fourth point I would make, 
and I do think this is significant,  is that the principal argument in 
1967 with respect to Loving and that  the commonwealth of Virginia 
advanced was: Well, the social science is  still uncertain about how 
biracial children will fare in this world, and  so you ought to apply 
rational basis scrutiny and wait. And I think the  Court recognized that
 there is a cost to waiting and that that has got  to be part of the 
equal protection calculus. And so—so I do think that’s  quite 
fundamental.<br id=".reactRoot[347].[1][2][1]{comment10101654502829921_17180235}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0.[1]" /><br id=".reactRoot[347].[1][2][1]{comment10101654502829921_17180235}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3].0.[2]" /><strong>CHIEF  JUSTICE ROBERTS:</strong>
 Can I ask you a problem about—it seems to me that your  position that 
you are supporting is somewhat internally inconsistent.  We see the 
argument made that there is no problem with extending  marriage to 
same-sex couples because children raised by same-sex couples  are doing 
just fine and there is no evidence that they are being  harmed. And the 
other argument is Proposition 8 harms children by not  allowing same-sex
 couples to marriage. Which is it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder why Roberts didn’t want to address the argument that 
biracial children can fare well in the world? I can’t think of any 
reason why he’d want to avoid that issue. I’m sure he didn’t change the 
subject to avoid talking about the fact that <em>the sitting President</em> might be relevant to the argument?</p>
<p>I don’t read a lot of Supreme Court transcripts, but I do teach 
argument and did do forensics in high school, so I know both what the 
former entails and what the latter occasionally requires, <em>i.e. </em>having
 to take the AFF or NEG of a case based on a draw instead of a deeply 
held belief. You have to argue the case you have to argue, I get that, 
but honestly? Cooper couldn’t have made a more unsympathetic case about 
an issue which, though it will be decided on other grounds, needed an 
argument based on something more sophisticated than bigotry in order to 
acquire more popular support. It’s not just a freshmen composition 
course he failed today.</p>

It has two components. To paraphrase the rubric: the students create their own rhetorical performance, explore questions of how to target an audience, follow the conventions of a genre, choose the medium for their message, and all the while, use the critical tools they’ve been learning all quarter to develop their ideas. They then perform a rhetorical analysis of their own work via a detailed writer's memo. The pedagogical theory behind this is sound: by forcing them to do something fun at the end of the quarter, I get better evaluations the tools I taught them over the course of it become more solidly ensconced in their brain-space. Only this time, instead of deducing the rhetorical intent behind someone else's decisions, they must decide how to communicate their message to their target audience most effectively. One of the highlights of this quarter was a remake of the Game of Thrones opening credit sequence, only intended for an audience of the sort one finds at the University of California, Irvine: I hope that, as a student project completed in a little under two weeks, this doesn't violate Fair Use and won't be taken down, but I can't be sure. Also, I'll credit the student when I hear back from her about whether she wants credit for it. Given that I've already had a Disney animator think it worthy of praise, though, I'm fairly comfortable sharing it with the world.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2013/03/representations-of-rape-in-comics.html"><span><strong>Representations of rape in comic books</strong> [I'm re-posting this because I received an email on my earlier post inquiring as to whether &quot;cartoons&quot; are capable of tackling difficult social issues responsibly. I think this old post demonstrates how something as ostensibly slight as a &quot;cartoon&quot; can have a profound impact on a person's moral development.] The year was 1988. I was a recent transplant to Louisiana and a tad on the introverted side. (What with being deaf and all.) So I spent endless hours reading comic books. I may have “like ‘em liked” some girls at this point, but can find no evidence of it in my fourth grade yearbook. Not only did I know nothing about girls, I distinctly remember not even knowing what this “rape” thing I heard about on the news was. But I mowed my lawn every day—my father having decided to instill the value of hard work by allowing me to earn $4 whenever I wanted by re-mowing what my new work ethic transformed into a hilariously mangy lawn—and so I had plenty of money to blow on X-books. Meaning I spent most afternoons blissfully unaware of anything that didn’t involve the X-Men or X-Factor or The New Mutants or, if I was desperate enough, Alpha Flight. One late October afternoon, I purchase a copy of X-Men #236. On the cover Wolverine and Rogue are hung by their feet from a scaffold, flanked on both sides by grinning fools in military garb. (This image disturbs me more now than it did then.) What had happened? The X-Men had sacrificed themselves to save the world, only in the end they were granted a reprieve: they would be dead to the world but would live undetected and undetectable in the Australian outback. They were invisible to all forms of electronic recording devices. They were able to move throughout the world invisible to all by the naked eye. Or so they thought until a fascist state called “Genosha” declared war on them. To make a long story short: shit hit fans. Wolverine and Rogue were captured. For those unfamiliar with the comics or the films, Rogue has the power to absorb the memories and/or mutant powers of whomever she touches. So, naturally, she doesn’t touch anyone for fear of knocking them unconscious and draining them of their “life energy.” Her entire life Rogue has wanted nothing more than to touch someone without hurting them. To be loved. But she’d come to accept the fact that this would never happen. This self-sacrifice moved my fourth-grade mind. I sympathized with her despite having no clue as to what she sacrificed or why. I only knew that it pained her and, being the good sympathetic identifier that I was, I felt her pain by proxy. So without really knowing why, I wanted Rogue to be able to touch people. And after she’s captured by the Genoshans, she’s stripped of her mutant powers. Now she can touch people without having to worry about killing them. For a moment,...</span></a></div>
