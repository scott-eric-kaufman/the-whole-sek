		<span id="comment-72182368-content"><p>Scott, I think that this whole thing is ... poorly advised.  I&#39;ll get the easy things out of the way first: the threat to report you is both silly and stupid, and who knows what the anonymous guy is thinking.  But you&#39;re reacting in a way that perpetuates a conflict, on a side that you&#39;re not really on.  OK, so you received a weird comment from an Internet nut.  That&#39;s no reason to write &quot;Is this a common tactic among online leftists?  I wouldn&#39;t think so—I&#39;m a leftist frequently online, and I&#39;ve never considered contacting someone&#39;s employer—but it seems to be happening everywhere now.&quot;  It&#39;s no reason to write friendly replies to people <a href="http://ilykadamen.blogspot.com/2007/06/hurl.html" rel="nofollow">like Ilyka</a> when they write &quot;Vigilantism: It&#39;s the new core liberal value.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t elect the Jesus&#39; General guy to be avatar and representative of liberalism.  Still less did I elect whichever of his random commenters happened to say something stupid, threatening, or misogynistic as avatar and representative of online leftism.  The people who want to pick fights over this are crazy, and bringing the crazy here is not really a great idea, I think.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-72185244-content"><p>The thread you&#39;re dipping into over there <i>is</i> frightening, Scott. All of this, the whole affair, does underscore how scarily Limbaugh-esque the mainline liberal &#39;sphere is becoming. There&#39;s a Weberian / charisma deal to write about it, if you&#39;re up for it... (I&#39;m certainly not...) </p>

<p>On the other hand, you <i>do</i> like to cause trouble, doncha? Which is a great thing, and really what it&#39;s all about. And you know that, at least in the past, I loved to cause trouble too. But suddenly at some point I realized that there is a terrible consequence differential in many on-line discussions. You and me are paid to think and write, and if someone catches us out, frames us the wrong way, we are royally fucked. But many of our interlocutors, for whom this is the only thinking and writing (if that&#39;s the word, in certain cases) in their lives, have no such issue. </p>

<p>Assymetrical warfare, I think they call it...</p>

<p>Anyway, it&#39;s a very weird situation. In &quot;real&quot; academic life, you trust people a little bit, but not all that much, not to cause you harm if you get into a scrap. So you try to be collegially-open but stay mostly guarded. On here, we swing between our coterie of very trusted folks - people that are in the group, and that we know won&#39;t break the rules, or take things the wrong way - and the Whole Wide World, where you never know what kinds of numbnuts or general malcontent you&#39;re going to run into. One gives oneself away in a manner that you&#39;d never even think of doing in meatspace, and then someone comes along to show you that you shouldn&#39;t have done that. </p>

<p>In short, this is why I&#39;ve stopped with the comment box fights, altogether. Asymmetrical stakes etc... </p>

<p>But that is a bullshit thread indeed... <br />

<p>If you don&#39;t approve of these tactics you may wish to become a free-speech feminist, or a free-speech liberal, or a free-speech libertarian.</p>

<p>You may wish to read Wendy Kaminer at <a href="http://thephoenix.com/TheFreeForAll/," rel="nofollow">http://thephoenix.com/TheFreeForAll/,</a> or Nadine Strossen.</p>

<p>It is most likely the case that you will want to be more thoughtful about what modern mainstream feminists have to tell you about how speech needs to be controlled.</p>

<p>In the meantime do be careful of what you say around Ilyka, she has a nasty habit of calling people like Maga racists, people like JG misogynists, and she even called me a rape apologizer for the crime of saying that false accusations of rape should be seriously investigated.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s your vigilantism right there.  Suggest that false accusations of a crime should be taken seriously in modern america and some sort of self-identified modern feminist will call you a rape apologist.</p></span>

It&#39;s just that any hint of generalization from one Internet commenter to an entire community, much less a political tendency, mixes really badly with the aftermath of this thing.  Ilyka&#39;s comment isn&#39;t &quot;[dropping] by to express some support&quot;, it&#39;s continuing the &quot;I hate whitemaleprogressives so much right now&quot; (quoted from my last link) bit.</p>

<p>As I wrote in the last thread on this, I think that perceived disrespect for the dead was the primary driver for the initial reaction. The desire to get group payback for the resignation seems to be the primary driver for the counter-reaction.  (That and various conservatives, concern trolling.)  Those are both ultra-toxic motives, and anyone commenting who appears to be on one side or the other is going to have people trying to drag them in.</p></span>

<p>As an aside: this is one of the reasons why I always thought Zizek-flavored radicalism was fairly amusing.  Want an online left (or an online mainline liberalism?)  Want, in addition to that, party discipline?  Then this kind of thing is only the first hint of how the gears grind.  It may be fine for the Zizekian to admire Lenin, because everyone knows that there is no chance of a Western academic actually being involved in shooting people for the revolution.  But taking any steps for Leninesqe casting-out of deviationists, or enforcement of party discipline, or simple badmouthing of competing groups -- what do people think that Lenin actually *did* for most of his career, before he got military power?  Yet strangely enough &quot;procedural liberalism&quot; also becomes shorthand for all that is supposed to be timid and temporizing.</p></span>

<p>All this &#39;becoming&#39;: I don&#39;t see evidence of a trend. I see anecdotes. I&#39;ve seen nasty shit like this at least since I  started hanging out in lefty blogs (2002). Likely I&#39;ve even engaged in it myself, although as I recall, it was against someone who was cheering on Abu Ghraib even after the reports of child rape came out. And I can imagine that anyone who&#39;s ever hung out in political conversations, let alone with activists, whether it&#39;s left or right politics, has had to deal with all manner of sharp personalities and puerility, with the politics of purity (or politics of destruction, if you want to call it that), with cults of personality, with fantasizing about the Revolution, or with internecine tattling.</p>

<p>Certainly I don&#39;t remember the political conversations of the 90s as a halcyon time of decency. Those of you who were doing usenet or listservs in that period know how crazy it could get. And I remember the nastiness of bbs&#39;s in the mid to late 80s. We might go back, at least, to the American left of the 60s. And we might want to wonder if the left is more inclined than the right to engaging in all this nonsense, but I&#39;d advise strongly against any identification of trends unless, you know, you have evidence. </p></span>

The objections to this instance seem to have come mainly because it was friendly fire, not because of the tactic itself.</p>

<p>In my own, offline, activism, my actions have contributed directly towards one or two people being fired -- employees of polluting companies who their employers chose as scapegoats.  I&#39;ve also   participated in direct attempts to get corrupt regulators fired -- those hardly ever succeed, sadly, but they do put people on notice that they&#39;d better be less obvious in their corruption.  Politics is sometimes nasty.  Any serious online politics is going to be too.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-72216530-content"><p>CR:</p>

<p><em>You and me are paid to think and write, and if someone catches us out, frames us the wrong way, we are royally fucked. But many of our interlocutors, for whom this is the only thinking and writing (if that&#39;s the word, in certain cases) in their lives, have no such issue.</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s the framing that bothers me.  I suppose this is what we all have to worry about, even if we don&#39;t participate in online scrums.  Someone can easily rip our words from context, and our explanation (any explanation, for that matter) will seem petty.  </p>

<p>And while I do like to cause trouble, in this case, that wasn&#39;t my intent.  My inability to stop the spigot when I see idiots behaving idiotically, however, is something I need to work on.</p>

<p>Anon:</p>

<p>I&#39;m sensing (from here and <em>Slant Truth</em>) that there is a history—nay, a <em>context</em>—to your post that I&#39;m not getting.  I say that because I&#39;m not understanding the cause of your complaint.  While I&#39;m not partial to identitarian thought myself, I understand and appreciate its tactical value in the public sphere.  I&#39;ve run into Ilyka before, and while she is vehement, I&#39;ve never found her the shriekingly incoherent ideologue you&#39;re painting here.</p>

<p><em>I gather you feel you&#39;re JG&#39;s enemy.</em></p>

<p>Not in the least.  Just African Americans can be racist, intelligent people can write stupid things.  If the forum is structured such that you can&#39;t call them on it, the scene will stagnate.  (Intellectually, at least.  I suspect it will become quite popular among a certain set of &quot;thinkers.&quot;)</p>

<p>Rich:</p>

<p><em>It&#39;s just that any hint of generalization from one Internet commenter to an entire community, much less a political tendency, mixes really badly with the aftermath of this thing.</em></p>

<p>Point taken.</p>

<p><em>Ilyka&#39;s comment isn&#39;t &quot;[dropping] by to express some support&quot;, it&#39;s continuing the &quot;I hate whitemaleprogressives so much right now&quot;</em></p>

<p>She can&#39;t hate them <em>that</em> much, since she dropped by to support one.  Her hatred is aimed at a particular group of whitemaleprogressives who, I must say, are oftentimes deserving of it.  (I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve read <a href="http://faultline.org/index.php/site/comments/resignation_an_open_letter_to_the_progressive_blogosphere/" rel="nofollow">Chris Clarke&#39;s &quot;resignation&quot;</a> already, but I&#39;ll link to it anyway.)</p>

<p><em>Those are both ultra-toxic motives, and anyone commenting who appears to be on one side or the other is going to have people trying to drag them in.</em></p>

<p>Though I attempted to remain above the fray, it quickly became apparent—when everyone insisted that she was <em><b>my</b></em> Brittany—that doing so is impossible.  While I don&#39;t want to judge that side of the &#39;sphere by its worst elements, I will say that the dynamic there is such that it makes anyone who particpates (either actively or, as so many do, via fawning appreciation) appreciably dumber.</p>

<p>Kevin:</p>

<p>As Karl notes, it may not have started this, but with <em>this particular crowd</em>, that seems to have been the watershed moment.  </p>

<p>Gah, more later.  I&#39;m annoying myself and have work to do.  </p></span>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you read &quot;whitemaleprogressives&quot; and felt indicted.  The contraction of the three words into one was meant to be a clue that I was talking about a particular type, a subset of white, male progressives.  That contraction is an adaptation of The Unapologetic Mexican&#39;s &quot;WHITEPROGRESSIVE&quot; label, which he also uses to denote a particular type.</p>

<p>That said, I would appreciate it if you did not talk over my head about me to Scott when I&#39;m right here.  If you have a problem with something I said, do me the courtesy of addressing me directly, please, and I will be happy to do the same for you.</p></span>

But, OK: I didn&#39;t take &quot;whitemaleprogressives&quot; as an indictment, or as evidence of a serious lasting dislike of all white male progressives.  It did indicate to me that you were looking for a stereotyped group of people to blame for what basically seemed to be an individual mistake -- no different in kind than the people going on about how Brittney&#39;s lack of context in her post was all because of Southern culture or something.</p>

<p>To me, it appears that Brittney was tired, JG was pissed off, and both have their friends and supporters who of course support them against attack by those others.  You&#39;re one of the people who gleefully tried to turn this from two people each making a mistake into a clash of group vs group, complete with pumping up of grievances.  I don&#39;t know whether you&#39;re actually a conservative and a provocateur, but if you were, I&#39;d expect you to be doing exactly as you have been doing.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-72252924-content"><p>Rich, I don&#39;t want to be rude, but that&#39;s really offensive (the conservative and provacateur bit). Whether you believe me or not, I don&#39;t have a history of any type of conservatism in my life, but since I, like, seemingly, an awfully high number of POC and white women on the net have noticed certain traits and priorities in a number of white male liberal commentators, does that make us provacateurs as well? I have a problem with JG&#39;s behavior, yes, and moreover, I have a problem with the way he went about addressing some of his critics. He chose to show up and behvae as a condescending, sexist person, ilyka didn&#39;t make him do it. We were there, we saw it and we didn&#39;t like it, but that&#39;s her fault? And I&#39;m sorry if thinking that things that matter to me are important and not just accepting the fact that the white guys are the leaders, they&#39;re going to be dismissive of any concern that doesn&#39;t affect them, and that&#39;s the way it should be because they&#39;re smart and take the long view and their concerns are universal if only we&#39;d realize it while we&#39;re just selfish and petty and insignificant and should just do the grunt work with no imput ad no obnoxious squeaky wheel stirring the pot, let it go, who cares, if it doesn&#39;t matter to me it doesn&#39;t matter, makes me a saboteur. What you see as a gleeful stirring up of an individual mistake many of us see as yet again encountering an attitude that we&#39;re so damn sick of encountering all the time from people who are supposed to be on our side.</p>

<p>And thanks for doing her the courtesy of addressing her directly, I hope it &quot;got you somewhere.&quot; </p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/refined_white_s.html"><span><strong>&quot;Refined white supremacy in a UCI Lecturer's blog comments&quot;</strong> UPDATE #4 HERE. UPDATE #2 HERE. UPDATE #1 HERE. That is the title of the letter &quot;The Ghost of Adolph Rupp&quot; sent to members of the UCI community. Seems I am now a white supremacist. That said, as someone who writes and comments under his own name, I'm not particularly worried. I comported myself on that thread as I always do. For the record: I am not a white supremacist, nor am I an enabler of white supremacy. I am interested in the historical and rhetorical context of race in American culture. (I've taught two courses on the subject.) And I am interested in the context of online rhetoric. This particular thread fascinated me because it intersects with many of my scholarly interests. But it will probably be the last time I attempt a discussion of these interests online, because you never know when the person across from you will decide it's time to notify your superiors that they have a white supremacist among them. (Even though they don't.) Although it will cause me personal inconvenience, I do hope the people who received this email take it seriously. Accusations of hate-speech and race-based discrimination should be investigated, so that when the complaints are legitimate they can be dealt with accordingly. Just because someone took the time to craft an inaccurate, slanderous letter painting me as white supremacist does not mean that all such letters will be inaccurate and slanderous. Here is the text of his letter: &quot;Refined white supremacy in a UCI Lecturer's blog comments&quot; The UCI lecturer's name is Scott Eric Kaufman. http://www.ags.uci.edu/~skaufman/contact.html I informed Mr. Kaufman yesterday that I would be contacting UCI and I invited him to suggest names of people who he wanted included. Mr. Kaufman declined to respond, but he is copied on this email. Over the course of several days, Mr. Kaufman was vigorous in his defense that it was appropriate that ABC affiliate post an excerpt of this with a link: &quot;Death of A House Negro First Hogzilla II, now this? Not to convert this place into the Dead Meat Buffet but an enormous amount of meat died this weekend and we’re all the better for it. It goes without saying that the term “house negro” gets bandied about with great frequency against anyone of seemingly African descent when they are on the Right. Be you Clarence Thomas, Condoleeza Rice, Michael Steele, or J.C. Watts, you can expect a Harry Belafonte, a Danny Glover, or yes - even a Steve Gilliard to call you out for being the race traitor that you are. The sell-out, Oreo cookies who do Whitey’s bidding and put a black face on racist policies that would otherwise be rightly called out for what they are. Uncle Thomas and Aunt Thomasinas alike. But really, who is doing whose bidding in those situations? Can Howard Dean call Condoleeza his “do right answer mammy who be smart”? Can James Carville call out Clarence for collard greens? Which brings us to today’s...</span></a></div>
