        <meta name="description" content="My close-reading instincts typically compel me to focus on scenes more than structure, and that's not necessarily a good thing. So let's talk about structure from the point of view of someone who went to film school before the advent of DVDs and Netflix, by which I mean before we could finish one episode and jet right into the next. Traditional dramatic structure in serial narratives involves table-setting and brain-burning. In &quot;You Win or You Die,&quot; here's how the table's set: Jaime Lannister enters the tent of his father, Tywin, but he does so out of focus and in the midground. In the foreground, shot in shallow focus, is a big dead stag-looking beast, which creates a connection in our heads between whatever it is Jaime's talking about and big dead beasts. (That stags are affiliated with House Baratheon isn't immaterial either. Especially when you consider that when introduced to Tywin, he's elbow deep in a dead stag, suggesting his role in Baratheon's demise.) This is significant because it's not just that beast is big and dead—as we're fine with that when such heads are hung on walls—but that it's in the process of being broken down: As everyone knows, if you want to make the majority of Americans uncomfortable, ask them where their meat comes from. Tell them that it wasn't born shrink-wrapped on a styrofoam plate and that it had a sad face when it was dispatched. Point out that the meat department in their favorite grocery store is a literal wall of death befitting of a serial killer's trophy closet. Or not. You don't have to do that: seeing Tywin going to town on that beast has already made them uncomfortable enough. The writers and directors know this, which is why they shot this conversation, which could have occurred anywhere, in a room in which Tywin Lannister was butchering his kill. Moreover, it's significant that Twyin is butchering the beast himself, because as is noted in the &quot;Prologue,&quot; being suckled at your mother's teat is a sign of being low-born, so surely he someone in his employ who could butcher this beast for him. The fact that he's doing it himself is somewhat admirable, in that hunterly way, but it also suggests that he enjoys it, i.e. he enjoys doing something that the majority of Americans can't even bear thinking about, which makes them dislike him. Not that they didn't already, mind you, because the show has long since marshaled our sympathies against the Lannisters, but this is the opening scene in the episode—the lens through which all the events that occur in it will be seen. And there's a lot going on there. There's not just the beast on the table, there's the deliberate arrangement of dialogue and imagery, e.g. Read in deictic terms—in which the names and pronouns within a context point to items present in it—you would think that &quot;Poor Ned Stark&quot; re ferred to the beast being butchered. It obviously isn't, but it's..." />

			<p>My close-reading instincts typically compel me to focus on scenes more than structure, and that&#39;s not necessarily a good thing.

Tell them that it wasn&#39;t born shrink-wrapped on a styrofoam plate and that it had a sad face when it was dispatched. Point out that the meat department in their favorite grocery store is a literal wall of death befitting of a serial killer&#39;s trophy closet. Or not. You don&#39;t have to do that: seeing Tywin going to town on that beast has already made them uncomfortable enough. The writers and directors know this, which is why they shot this conversation, which could have occurred anywhere, in a room in which Tywin Lannister was butchering his kill. Moreover, it&#39;s significant that Twyin is butchering the beast himself, because as is noted in the &quot;Prologue,&quot; being suckled at your mother&#39;s teat is a sign of being low-born, so surely he someone in his employ who could butcher this beast for him. The fact that he&#39;s doing it himself is somewhat admirable, in that hunterly way, but it also suggests that he enjoys it, <em>i.e. </em>he enjoys doing something that the majority of Americans can&#39;t even bear thinking about, which makes them dislike him.</p>
<p>Not that they didn&#39;t already, mind you, because the show has long since marshaled our sympathies against the Lannisters, but this is the opening scene in the episode—the lens through which all the events that occur in it will be seen. And there&#39;s a lot going on there. There&#39;s not just the beast on the table, there&#39;s the deliberate arrangement of dialogue and imagery, <em>e.g.</em></p>

It obviously isn&#39;t, but it&#39;s not a coincidence that Tywin is berating Jaime for unsuccessfully murdering Stark while he&#39;s breaking down the beast. This accounts for why Jaime&#39;s eyeline matches, as above, consistently lead to the floor, or that wall there, or anywhere other than the beast. It represents his failure to take care of his business himself: he hunted down and wounded Stark, but he failed to kill him. Jaime&#39;s attempt wasn&#39;t

Tywin is &quot;cleaning&quot; that carcass, which means that the pun doubles back on itself, because &quot;cleaning&quot; a carcass involves getting your hands dirty:</p>
<p>

Note that no new emotional manipulation is at work here: the general feeling the audience has toward these houses is merely being intensified by this opening scene. Foremost in the audience&#39;s mind as this episode begins, then, is the fact that the head of house Lannister enjoys a bloody hands-on approach to his politicking, especially when it involves</p>

As you can see from the above, we have the foregrounded Tywin in medium close-up, but because both he and Jaime face the camera, there&#39;s no traditional reverse, just a zoom into a medium on Jaime:</p>
<p>

<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3dc7c9c1970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Game of thrones - you win or you die00020" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3dc7c9c1970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3dc7c9c1970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Game of thrones - you win or you die00020" /></a><br />Shot distribution is a subtle means of signifying importance, but the fact that Tywin gets two shots to every one of Jaime indicates where the ethos of house Lannister originates. This is the table that&#39;s been set: Lannisters kill with their own hands and clean what they kill with them too. Though mildly admirable as an ethos, it still discomfits an audience who, first, doesn&#39;t like to think about where meat comes from and, second, has come to associate that particular beast with Ned Stark. Meaning that, two minutes into the episode, we&#39;ve been reminded of exactly why we&#39;re not supposed to like the Lannisters. (Or, as a student mentioned in class, it&#39;s like we&#39;ve been handed &quot;urine-tinted lenses, like someone metaphorically pissed on our face.&quot; Which works, although maybe not metaphorically, at least as concerns the Lannisters in this episode.) </p>
<p>Before moving on to the brain-burning, a few points are worth mentioning. The first is that the word-image-play prevalent in the first scene is equally so in the last. After Robert&#39;s death, Ned brings a letter that states that he will be regent until an heir comes of age. He hands the letter to Ser Barristan, because </p>

The &quot;Protector of the Realm&quot; is a crippled man leaning on a cane, and therefore, visually at least, utterly unqualified to protect the realm. The use of the long shot here is deliberate—we need to see his entire body for the visual pun to work—and unusual, because almost every other shot of Ned in this scene is a close-up. Why? Because close-ups of sympathic characters engender even more sympathetic identification. We know we like Ned, but we need to be reminded of it:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3dc7f9a5970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Game of thrones - you win or you die00054" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3dc7f9a5970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3dc7f9a5970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Game of thrones - you win or you die00054" /></a><br />That pain on his face? It&#39;s honorable. It&#39;s for the kingdom. It&#39;s what separates him from everyone else. Speaking of which, remember that self-reliant Lannister ethos that was established in the first scene? Here&#39;s its structural counterpart in the last:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee53d0518970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Game of thrones - you win or you die00073" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee53d0518970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee53d0518970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Game of thrones - you win or you die00073" /></a><br />Not that it&#39;s any revelation that the boy-king&#39;s blood runs deep with delegation, but in this scene it&#39;s particularly apparent how reliant he is on his mother&#39;s machinations. In the first scene, Tywin compared Lannisters to lions in a positive sense—male lions are powerful beasts, kings of all animals and what-not—but in this final scene the little lion is portrayed in an almost naturalistic light, because as we all know, in the wild, the majority of hunting is done by the lionesses. All of which is only to say that Joffrey is no Tywin, nor even his father&#39;s son, who at least tried to kill Ned himself. </p>
<p>Speaking of which, we should discuss the brain-burning. What do I mean by that? The last image of an episode—the one the director intended to burn onto your brain until the new episode aired next week, or did before the advent of DVDs and Netflix. However, I believe that directors trained before DVDs and Netflix still adhere to the traditional serial logic that requires the final image in an episode to be of maximal import. Why? Because episodes still end like this:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee53d2246970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Game of thrones - you win or you die00070" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee53d2246970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee53d2246970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Game of thrones - you win or you die00070" /></a><br />After using close-ups to revitalize our sympathy for Ned throughout the final scene, the director cuts to black right after shoving his face into ours. Imagine sitting there on your couch at 10 p.m. on a Sunday night, and the last thing you see before the room goes dark is <em>that</em>. <em>That</em> is the image you&#39;ll live with for the next week: Littlefinger&#39;s betrayal on his lips and knife beneath Ned&#39;s chin. That&#39;s no accident. That&#39;s structure.</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c339b8e60970b-content"><p>This scene seems to be working on a few different levels.</p>

<p>The stag is also on the Baratheon sigil, and this is the episode where Robert kicks off. How did Robert die? He was drunk and gored by a boar, in the gut, but his debilitated reflexes were aided by a Lannister fortifying his wine. So what we have here is also a visual representation of how a Lannister eviscerates, or helped to eviscerate, the stag Robert Baratheon. But they&#39;re talking about Ned, which in a way makes perfect sense -- as the Hand of the King, Ned Stark is a kind of stand-in for Robert Baratheon/the stag, which in a way negates some of his northern wolfishness. </p>

<p>The threat to Ned&#39;s neck is also important.</p>

<p>This is also the second time we&#39;ve seen a stag with its stomach cut out: Recall the first episode, where the starks encountered the dead stag who caught the direwolf in the throat. The stag in that scene is well-dead, with its stomach gored out by the direwolf, yet the stag also managed to get an antler into the direwolf&#39;s neck -- see Littlefinger threatening Ned&#39;s neck, and that&#39;s also the physical location where Ned will later be killed. And if you want to get a little picky and point out how the dead direwolf was a female, well, spoiler alert, Catelyn&#39;s throat isn&#39;t all that safe either. However, in both cases the direwolf&#39;s pups survive. </p>

<p>So when the wolf engages the stag, the stag gets gored in the opening episode, when Robert gets gored, and when Tywin cleans this game; and the direwolf gets it in the throat in the opening episode, when Ned is named &quot;Protector of the Realm,&quot; and in the later scene which I won&#39;t spoil here. It&#39;s as if that opening scene functions as a kind of symbolic overture for the overall narrative, and this moment with Tywin gutting the stag and later Ned needing to protect his neck recalls those symbols. </p></span>

Tywin does it for pleasure, Ned does it for duty. Joffrey doesn&#39;t get the lesson that he must dirty his hands, but the Stark children do. That&#39;s one reason why, in the end, (some of?) the Stark children will be much more successful than Joffrey.</p></span>

SEK: Given the fact that we studied Fellowship of the Ring and Game of Thrones, I could easily see something like the &quot;Sean Bean Death Reel&quot; being a viable final project. STUDENT #1: What if we made a perfect copy of the One Ring out of metal? SEK: Nope. You can't turn in anything you bought from Skymall. STUDENT #2: Can we do Reverse Game of Thrones? SEK: A Throne of Games? STUDENT #2: Like we get a regular guy to play Tyrion and hire little people to play everybody el— SEK: No! No reversing Game of Thrones!

(It actually contains more than three, but only three of the characters take advantage of the opportunity provided and I want to focus on them.) We'll begin with Arya Stark, who as the episode opens is literally practicing at life: The balanced long shot employed by director Daniel Minihan has the effect of bringing a sense of calm to this fencing lesson. Arya and her instructor, Syrio Forel, are playing at combat in a manner as elegant as this shot is composed. Note that Arya moves between the third arch from frame-left, while Syrio strikes at her from the third arch from frame-right. If this is fighting, it is unlike the brutal art being performed outside this very room at this very point in time: This violence is sloppily composed, with the elements of the background functioning as mere backdrop to the slaughter before them. The characters rush into and out of focus as jagged edits push and pull the viewer from one point in the mise-en-scene to another seemingly without reason. I say &quot;seemingly&quot; because the disorientation is clearly the point. Not being able to tell who is and isn't on &quot;the pointy end&quot; is why Minihan cuts from the above to: To here only after this skirmish concludes. The Lannister guards have a dispatched a man who lies helpless, dying if not already dead, and Minihan makes his suffering seem insignificant by shooting it from a high angle with canted framing. The canted framing is important because it keeps the shot uncomfortable even after the initial confusion is resolved. (&quot;So that is who was on the pointy end.&quot;) The deliberately awkward composition of the previous two frames and the frantic editing that transitioned one to the next leads to a clash not just between characters in the show but the formal elements of its direction. When the Lannister guards confront Syrio and Arya, the shot maintains most of its initial balance: It is slightly altered because the circumstances of the characters it had framed has altered. The fight that follows, then, will be between both the characters and their attendent compositions. Here, it seems as if Syrio and Arya have the upper hand: they occupy the center of the frame and the slightly low angle of framing makes them appear slightly more dominant than the figures in the background. (Who are the same height, relative to the frame, as Arya at this point.) This is Arya's moment—the point in her coming-of-age narrative in which she puts her training into practice—or it would be if not for the fact that ...you killed his father.
