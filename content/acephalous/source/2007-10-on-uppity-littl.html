He wrote a famous book called <i>The Critic of Pure Reason</i>.&quot; [followed by a long quote from wiki, then the conclusion:]  &quot;In my opinion, Kant&#39;s opinion of beauty wasn&#39;t really right.&quot;  Or do people really do better than that?</p></span>

<p><em>What&#39;s so unthinkable about an undergrad coming up with a good point and refuting Kant - I mean it is probably not going to happen, but isn&#39;t it arrogant for us to assume that it is impossible? </em></p>

<p>I actually thought I could refute Kant ... and in a four page paper, no less.  As you note, the best I can say for myself is that I was engaged; the honesty of the engagement, well, there&#39;s a reason I call myself an uppity snot.</p>

<p>Jacob:</p>

<p><em>Now I&#39;m curious what the &quot;don&#39;t be an asshole&quot; speech/talk was like.</em></p>

<p>McGee&#39;s a sometimes reader, so I&#39;m hoping he shows up and recounts it himself.  (Consider this permission, Pat.  Have at me again!)  But in case he doesn&#39;t, here&#39;s the executive summary:</p>

<p><em>You like theory, and that&#39;s awesome.  I wish more kids were enthusiastic.  <b>BUT</b> -- and this is a big, <b>bolded</b>, ALL-CAPS &quot;<b>BUT</b>&quot; -- there are different ways to approach theoretical problems.  I&#39;ll charitably define yours as an &quot;entitled imperialism,&quot; because you believe that reading a tiny excerpt of a three-part philosophical masterpiece entitles you to lay waste to Kant&#39;s entire project.  You can&#39;t do that.  Only assholes can.  Hence, the danger.  You have to take writers seriously, study them, the commentary on them, and then -- and ONLY then -- should you assert yourself as you did in this paper.</em></p>

<p>Something like that ... only stretched out over the course of an hour, with many examples from the secondary literature on Kant to show me what engaged critique actually looks like, and featuring a young man nearly in tears.</p>

<p>Human:</p>

<p>There&#39;s <em>got</em> to be more to that story, and I want, <em>nay!</em> demand it.  </p>

<p>Rich:</p>

<p>There&#39;s something to that -- crawling is but a stumbled, broken gait -- but the analogous problem here wouldn&#39;t be overacting, but <b>SHOUTING ALL THE LINES BECAUSE THAT&#39;S WHAT I THINK ACTORS DO</b> ... when, in fact, I&#39;d made a category error.  That&#39;s what SHOUTERS do, not actors.</p>

<p>Ahistoricality and Sisyphus:</p>

<p>I realize there are contemporary artists for whom shit might qualify as a means and/or medium, but that&#39;s not what I was going on about in the essay.  I was trying to make the laughably radical claim that because Kant can&#39;t make assumptions about future people&#39;s depraved taste -- the steaming pile of dung on the sidewalk being, in and of itself, a work of art -- he must be wrong about absolutely everything he ever said ever.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-85930956-content"><p>Oh I&#39;ve done similar.<br />
I have something that operates like a subconscious facility for the prediction of arguments just over the horizon of my reading.  This would make me a genius if it ever truly produced anything original; instead it&#39;s a source of almost guaranteed despair.  In my earlier years I would naturally assume that I had invented the ideas and arguments that I came up with, only to be later crushed by finding them to be relatively well established, and often hundreds of years old.  In my latter years, this has generated a pervasive feeling of foreboding, as any time I have what seems like an original idea, I can be assured that it is often more worth my effort to try and find out who had that idea first than it is to actually attempt to develop it on my own.<br />
I can think of no better example of how my earlier arrogance transformed itself into crippling anxiety than the case of utilitarianism.<br />
When I was something like fourteen years old, I suddenly invented utilitarianism.  It was so simple and clear!  I literally believed, and informed people of the fact, that I had &quot;solved morality.&quot;  I thought I was going to write a short book to explain it, and it would spread around the world uniting people in harmonious mathematically sound arrangements of cooperation.<br />
I even had concepts corresponding to things like felicific calculus, though of course I didn&#39;t call it that.  It literally pains me to admit that my fourteen year old brain thought that a good name for such a thing would be simply &quot;happy math&quot;.  I started spreading the word and trying to teach skeptical peers and older folk about the glorious solution, never failing to add that it was I who had seen through the mist and grasped mankind&#39;s final salvation.  <br />
The worst thing about this whole affair was, of course, the end of it.  It would be one thing if I had the contained embarrassing experience of being forcibly enlightened by a knowledgeable sort, and then having to admit my ignorance to those who had been the victim of my exuberance.  But no.  Certain doubts of my own caused me to lapse into a period of silence about my invention; a time during which I fell out of touch with most of the people I had told about it.  It was only at the tail end of this period that I was fatefully linked to a page concerning &quot;Utilitarianism&quot;.  I would soon discover all my ideas were not my own, and neither were my concerns about them hollow.  Thus was my shame sealed forever.<br />
Most of the people who I professed my genius to will never know that I have since learned the depth of my ignorance.  I can only speculate as to the paths these people have taken.  An unfortunately high number of them probably remain in ignorance about most basic philosophical concepts, a fact that I have mixed feelings about.  The rest, presumably, now remember me as a Damn Fool and there&#39;s nothing I can do about that.<br />
The net effect of the whole affair is in certain ways negligible.  The total number of people who think that I am a Damn Fool did not multiply disproportionately.  <br />
But from a personal point of view, it&#39;s still brutally embarrassing because it&#39;s such a simple example of how all the intelligence and exuberance I can sum up can be so easily thwarted by a certain simple and unpredictable ignorance.<br />
As the years go by, the ideas I thought were my own are taken from me by my education and I am glad that I have not been so vocal about them yet, but I wonder if this fear will be crippling when the time comes that I need to speak up.</p></span>

<p>Just kidding.</p>

<p>Actually, I&#39;ve written a book about the phenomenon of discovering things just before you read about them.  You just haven&#39;t read it yet.</p>

<p>No, just kidding again.</p>

<p>Actually, I once wrote a novel in which a character called J.S. Nelson goes through life rediscovering things that other people having already discovered, only to find out a bit later that they&#39;ve already been discovered.</p>

<p>Still kidding.</p>

<p>To God, we are all J.S. Nelson.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-85944724-content"><p>JS, as Lou notes, life has many crushing disappointments for us all.  The knowledge that one&#39;s brilliant conceptual insights are likely not to be as unique as one once imagined is indeed of the crushing variety, but one that anyone (or at least anyone smart enough to reimagine critical insights past) is subject to being compressed by.  One can either charge blindly ahead, convinced, ala Ayn Rand, of the independent brilliance of one&#39;s unique &quot;philosophy,&quot; or one can become slightly more modest and try and read and take into account what the before people have written.  I too greatly prefer your term &quot;happy math,&quot; and while I personally feel that Utilitarianism has real limits to it&#39;s utility, you have a great career ahead of you in rebranding past philosophical concepts for today&#39;s highly competitive and youth-oriented market.</p>

<p>Scott, I&#39;m not sure I would have graded you quite as highly (presuming I were competent to teach/grade anything about Kant; which I&#39;m not; at all) if only for phrases like &quot;a simple matter of proving the self-evident,&quot; but I really like the way your Prof handled it.  That I think is the real lesson here: that arrogant little twerps can indeed be reformed, taught a sense of humility and made to appreciate the thoughts of others as well as themselves.</p></span>

That said, I work at an academic library, so I spend a lot of time there and as I walk through the isles I sometimes wonder how long it would take to index and at least look over every single book that seems as though it could be relevant to my studies, just so that I might be closer to absolutely sure that this thing doesn&#39;t happen again when I am more embedded in academia and the stakes are higher.</p></span>

<p>how about anyone discovering Derrida&#39;s ideas before actually reading Derrida? has that happened to anyone expect moi? i believe i was deconstructing ideas and pretty much whatever came my way since i was at least 2 years old...</p></span>

Example: at the conference this weekend, two tenured faculty members—both of whom do the kind of work I only dream I could do—introduced themselves to me, acknowledged that they've read Acephalous for quite a while, then told me they almost didn't introduce themselves to me because, in their words, they were &quot;intimidated.&quot; Two things struck me as odd: Tenured faculty with illustrious publication histories felt intimidated by a grad student whose only publication to date is forthcoming in the minnesota review. They think I'm intimidating based on what I publish here. The first point is more interesting from an institutional perspective, but right now I'm more interested in the second one. From my perspective, Acephalous is a silly place tended by a silly person. I don't think my online persona—if you can call it that, given that I resemble myself mightily—would lead someone to think I'm intimidating. But I'm wrong. So I'm thinking I should soften my image, but I'm not sure how. A new avatar? More frequent cat pictures or posts in which I cry? To return the first, more interesting point: these professors obviously put some weight into what I've written here. Would they be nervous approaching a colleague whose work they've read? Of course not. So what makes them nervous about approaching a graduate student whose random online blather they've read? Is it the component of guilt implicit in the reading of blogs? Are they nervous not because of me per se, but because I represent the victory of the will-to-procrastinate over the will-to-produce? I don't know. Maybe some certain somebodies will enlighten me. *The LOL phenomenon has really sapped the horror from Oppenheimer's famously ungrammatical statement, hasn't it? Wait a minute—no one's done that yet? Pardon me while I consult Google. (Scott consults Google) Apparently not. Lucky for the Internet, I live to serve.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/the-key-to-lite.html"><span><strong>The Key to Literary Theory: Don't be an Asshole</strong> Since this comment's been linked to a few times, I thought I'd lift it from the thread and score a cheap post. The context: I turned in the paper savaged in yesterday's post. It came back with comments to the effect of: I'm giving you an &quot;A,&quot; but come talk to me. You don't want to become an asshole. But There Is Danger. Office hours Monday. Please attend. Don't, and for certain, you'll become an asshole. I showed up on Monday morning to receive my dressing-down. Went something like this: You like theory, and that's awesome. I wish more kids were enthusiastic. BUT—and this is an ALL-CAPS, BOLDED &quot;BUT&quot;—there are different ways to approach theoretical problems. I'll charitably define yours as an &quot;entitled imperialism,&quot; because you believe that reading a tiny excerpt of a three-part philosophical masterpiece entitles you to lay waste to Kant's entire project. You can't do that. Only assholes can. Hence, The Danger. You have to take writers seriously, study them, the commentary on them, and then—and ONLY then—should you assert yourself as you did in this paper. Only it took an hour to deliver, and was peppered with detailed examples from secondary literature on Kant to show me what engaged critique actually looks like. I left the office in tears, but with a firm idea of what solid theoretical critique looked like. If only it hadn't taken three years for me to produce any ... but that's another story. (Also, if you haven't read the comments on that last post, you've missed out on J.S. Nelson's maudlin tale of intellectual un-discovery and Human's inspiring story of Kant, conversion, and sexual discovery ... and are the worse for it.)</span></a></div>
