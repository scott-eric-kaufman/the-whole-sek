			<p>The vehemence with which a conservative denies the veracity of <a href="http://whitehouse.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/07/ad-linking-romney-to-death-of-the-wife-of-a-laid-off-steelworker-not-accurate/">this particular advertisement</a> is directly proportional to their awareness that it speaks to the truth  that occupies their nightmares: that so many millions of people will  genuinely benefit from the Affordable Care Act that it’ll become  increasingly difficult to elect Republicans. The brown people who once  populated their nightmares have been replaced by roaming hordes of  healthy Americans who appreciate the legislation that saved their lives.  These people will pull the lever for Democratic candidates because they  feel indebted to the party. But they’re even more frightened by another  group of people: those who have lost loved ones due to dropped coverage  or lifetime limits. Why?</p>
<p>Because it’s impossible to defend a system in which corporations  invest in the deaths of their clients to the relatives of the deceased.  Rationing works according to a terrible but understandable rationale:  “You must die so that others may live.” But the current system works  according to a singularly grim calculation: “You must die so that others  might profit.” That’s not a winning argument and those responding to  this advertisement know it. They need to transform its message into  something palatable. <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2012/08/07/cnn-wife-of-steelworker-in-new-obama-super-pac-ad-still-had-job-and-health-insurance-after-he-lost-his/">For example</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowing what we know now about the timeline of all this,  what’s left of  the accusation in the original smear ad? What is it,  precisely, that  Bain is being faulted for doing or not doing? They  shouldn’t have closed  down the plant because it was unfair to expect  the workers who were  laid off to ever find new jobs with insurance? It  was negligent not to  predict that some workers’ wives might get laid  off too and wouldn’t  find a new job <em>for years</em> before they became ill? There appears to be no actual policy or business critique here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There only “appears to be no policy or business critique” because  someone’s afraid that confronting it will remind people of the  substantial policy and business critiques that are always at play: that  relying on an insurance system that’s only affordable when partially  subsidized by an employer leads to a situation in which chronic  unemployment is tantamount to a death sentence. They can’t even bring up  that fact to refute it without ending up defending an untenable  argument. So <a href="http://patterico.com/2012/08/08/most-disingenuous-ad-ever/">they deflect</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Romney left Bain’s day-to-day operations two years before  the evil plant  closing.  The plant was in financial trouble before  Bain ever got  involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because if they focus on the specific facts presented in this  particular argument they might not be compelled to defend the current  system <em>on principle</em>. They might be able to avoid the unpleasant  truth that the emotional appeal of the advertisement comes from the  manner in which it militates the facts of a life against the callousness  of a corporate culture. Remove Bain from the equation and the appeal is  no less effective. Conservatives know and fear this: they know that  they’ll be running against stories like this and they know that the only  humane response to them is to discredit the particulars. If they can  convince the electorate that <em>this </em>tragedy didn’t happen as advertised they might not have to discuss the many millions that did. So this argument will be about <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/313419/obama-camp-not-familiar-guy-who-was-their-ad-conference-call-katrina-trinko">the administration’s reluctance to distance itself from the advertisement</a>. Or it’ll be about <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2012/08/romney-campaign-expresses-pride-in.html">whether Romney’s personally responsible for this man losing his job</a>. Or it’ll be about <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2012/08/08/meet-the-real-workers-obama-screwed-over/">how unions are culpable in the closing of the plant that employed him</a>.</p>
<p>It’ll be about any and everything except what it’s about: the fact  that the impoverished and unemployed have a better chance of living a  full life than they did before Obama was elected.</p>

<p>True, but the ACA doesn&#39;t really change that, especially with the Medicare expansion defanged. Simply requiring people to buy overpriced, inefficient, profit-driven insurance (and throwing in a few bones to make it slightly less overpriced) doesn&#39;t equate to everyone having affordable health care.</p>

<p><i>&quot;the fact that the impoverished and unemployed have a better chance of living a full life than they did before Obama was elected.&quot;</i></p>

<p>Unless they&#39;re undocumented immigrants or citizens of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, Libya, Syria, Iran... (There&#39;s some morbid humor to the fact that Obama has actually set up a literal death panel, just of a form few Republicans are willing to criticize.)</p></span>

Today he is standing in the checkout line. In front of him is a very large, very genial black WOMAN unloading eighteen loaves of white bread and half a dozen cases of Coke onto the conveyor belt. WOMAN: (singing under her breath) Breakdown, uh takedown, shakedown, everybody wants into uh crowded line ... SEK looks at her perplexedly. She removes yet another case of Coke from her clown car of a shopping cart and places it on the conveyor belt. WOMAN: (still singing under her breath) Breakdown, uh takedown ... SEK looks at her. She looks at SEK. WOMAN: (like she's Praising The Lord) YOU BUSTED! EVERYONE ELSE IN THE STORE turns to see who's been busted doing what. SEK would say something but he's trying too hard not to laugh. WOMAN: Well, you is. (her hands become little pistols miming Bang Bang Bang as she belts out) YOU BUSTED!</span></a></div>
