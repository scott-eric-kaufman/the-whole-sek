			<p>Given that I have all of <em>four days </em>to wrap up the Winter quarter and vault into the Spring, lesson-planning&#39;s taken the bulk of my time of late.&#0160; I&#39;m thinking, as per the tentative title of this post, of delving into meta-fictional accounts of the origin of comic &quot;heroism&quot; this quarter, and have come up with the following (largely other-side-of-the-pond) syllabus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;The Origin of Batman&quot; (excerpt from <em>Batman</em> 47) - Bob Kane </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You begin with the almost-begin: this is the first time Joe Chill&#39;s mentioned, by which I mean implicated, in the death of Wayne&#39;s parents.&#0160; There&#39;s an earlier reference to their murder in <em>Detective Comics </em>39 (November 1939), but it&#39;s abridged in a way that makes the story itself unrecognizable.&#0160; (Which is, yes, the very opposite of the point I make below about Morrison&#39;s <em>All-Star Superman</em>, but that&#39;s because you can&#39;t already assume an audience is familiar with a story before it&#39;s ever been told.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Batman:  Year One</em> (comic) - Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>See what I did  there?&#0160; In terms of comparative styles, now I can introduce <em>Asterios  Polyp</em>.&#0160; To wit, Mazzucchelli in <em>Year One</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Batman Begins</em> (film) - Christopher Nolan</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because you think I&#39;m capable of teaching this course without bringing up Nolan&#39;s film?&#0160; <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/batman-begins-works-because-christopher-nolan-decided-to-spend-the-first-hour-and-twenty-minutes-denying-the-audience-what-it.html" target="_self">I didn&#39;t think so</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Planetary/Batman </em>(comic)  - Warren Ellis </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This&#39;ll be the fourth re-telling of the Batman origin  myth, only this time <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/teaching-rhetoric-via-warren-ellis-planetary-batman-night-on-earth.html" target="_self">endlessly looped</a>.&#0160; The point, rhetorically speaking, in having them encounter four versions of the same story is 1) to emphasize that there&#39;s some inherent appeal there, but 2) to demonstrate that even if a story has inherent appeal, the manner in which a given rhetor presents it actually matters.&#0160; The raw stuff is all well and good, but the power&#39;s in the telling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Planetary</em> #1 -10 (comic) -  Warren Ellis </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re billed as &quot;the archeologists of the impossible,&quot; after all,  and Ellis&#39;s engagement with both the history of the genre and its conventions could hardly find a more suitable course to be taught in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>All-Star Superman</em> (comic) - Grant Morrison </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m thinking of teaching only&#0160;<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/files/all-star-superman-01.jpg"><span class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e60267ef6970c">the first page of the first issue</span></a>, as it&#39;s the most brilliantly compact origin story  ever, and after that Morrison&#39;s metafictional games might be a bit too much for students to handle.&#0160; There&#39;s a genius to its concision, <em>i.e. </em>the manner in which it boils down a story everyone already knows to its barest bones, and then presents them to a knowing audience in a way that is, quite frankly, moving.&#0160; (Sorry, sorry, I couldn&#39;t help myself.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</em>,  Volume One (comic) - Alan Moore</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Introducing students to old-school, public-domain heroism ... plus  plenty of opportunities to talk with my largely Asian-American classes about how &quot;The Yellow Peril&quot; is  depicted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Hellboy: Seed of Destruction</em> (comic) - Mike Mignola</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being an origin story that involved someone other than Batman, so the students can reevaluate their premises about mythos in American culture at the end of the quarter, etc. etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Hellboy</em> (film) - Guillermo Del Toro </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Etc. etc.&#0160; That&#39;s quite a bit of material for a composition class, and textually speaking—<em>i.e. </em>despite it being all film and comics—it&#39;s historically and allusively dense to boot.&#0160; But it seems doable.&#0160;&#0160; That said, if there&#39;s anything very obvious I&#39;m missing, feel free to point it out ... until Tuesday, because believe it or not, that&#39;s when the Spring quarter starts.</p>

To wit: I mean, if you were an anthropomorphic fish-penis hybrid and the woman you'd been raping for a week asked &quot;What the fuck is wrong with you?&quot; you'd answer with an emphatic &quot;HOORNGH!&quot; too.* *I wasn't kidding when I said I don't understand this book one bit. I hear tell the fourth and final issue's just come out, so maybe that'll make sense of it ... then I remember how Promothea concluded and entertain some serious doubts. All right, enough &quot;fun&quot; reading for me, I'm back to work on the Clowes post.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/04/batman-begins-again.html"><span><strong>Batman is always Beginning again</strong> (I never thought I'd dip back into this well, but then life happens and there you go.) Heath Ledger notwithstanding, I think it's fairly obvious that Batman Begins is the better of recent reboots. Nolan structures the first film not around an admittedly ingeniuous performance, but around a modified classical dynamic, by which I mean, he abides by his Aristotle. It opens with the most incentive of incentive moments—a boy watching his parents murdered before his eyes—then proceeds to a classic peripeteia*—that moment of reversal when the boy who witnessed his parents' murder decides to forsake revenge and fight all crime instead the responsible criminals. It need not bear mentioning, I don't think, that the deus ex machina, which Aristotle would otherwise despise, in this case fits within &quot;the unity of action,&quot; because it has &quot;an air of design&quot; that's well-nigh indisputable. The real crux is the film's anagnorisis—or &quot;revelation&quot; in the I-murdered-my-father-made-kids-with-my-mother-sense—which occurs at a time Aristotle would've approved of, but not in the way he'd prefer. You'll remember that, early in Batman Begins, the recently returned Bruce Wayne takes his horny butler's advice and invites some models to go swimming in a restaurant with him: Nolan's use of a medium-long shot there is deceptive, as these aren't really women so much as beards: I'm not saying they're all legs and hair, the cropped medium shot notwithstanding—but for the purpose of the plot, Nolan certain reduces them to as much. (We're just going to skip over the scene of them skinny dipping, you know, for the kids.) The point is that these women are props, mere things Alfred suggests Bruce Wayne should acquire should he not want to be discovered as the Batman. So, then, anagnorisis avoided ... except: The love of Wayne's life can't even look at him—and not just because I caught bad capture. She's just watched him escort two soaking models from a hotel she's about to learn he bought, so she shouldn't want to look at him. But when she does, he makes a plea: Which you can tell, because he's wearing his best &quot;plea&quot; face, insisting that he &quot;is more,&quot; whatever that means (&quot;I'm the Batman&quot;) but also because previously Nolan kept him, however blurrily, in frame with Rachel Dawes when she spoke: But when he needs to say something? The camera centers on him and her dark hair turns into an inhuman column: In this shot-reverse-shot sequence, he's clearly the focus. Granted, he may be out of focus on the reverse shots, but he's still recognizably him, whereas when the camera flips, she becomes another dark image plastered on a theater wall. The irony of this portrayal is significant, though, as she's about to utter the most important words in the film: &quot;It's not who you are underneath,&quot; she tells him, &quot;but what you do, that defines you.&quot; Note that from the beginning of this exchange to the utterance of this line, Nolan's moved from a medium, to a medium close-up, to a...</span></a></div>
