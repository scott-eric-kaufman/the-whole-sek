<p>The ultimate irony, of course, is his claim that this new moderate Islam &quot;will have to be non-literal and reformist.&quot;   McCarthy openly and unselfconsciously confesses that religious beliefs based on one-thousand-year-old books—or, for that matter, political beliefs based on two-hundred-year-old documents—might be obsolete, if not outright dangerous, when the people who possess them interpret their sacred texts literally.</p>
<p>His opposition to literalism as an interpretive mode is to be commended, or would be, if it extended to the Old Testament or the Constitution.

<p>Basically, he wants Muslims to become assimilated Reform Jews, or maybe Conservative ones, without acknowledging (a la Douthat) that adoption of Enlightenment values and Christian folkways by Jews was not merely the result of the innate attractiveness of these practices, but a combination of attraction, oppression and semi-voluntary dispersion. Nor acknowledging that, historically, the voices calling loudest for Jews to adapt were also calling for them to disappear. </p></span>

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what he wants, but I don&#39;t think he knows what he wants.</p>

<p>&quot;Nor acknowledging that, historically, the voices calling loudest for Jews to adapt were also calling for them to disappear.&quot;</p>

<p>Actually, he seems to be calling for exactly this: Islamic Islam has to be marginalized and attacked in order for the purely theoretical (but really, some of my best friends are) un-Islamic moderate Islam to emerge.  I think, while he makes some gestures towards post-Enlightenment values, ie &quot;the separation of secular public life from privately held religious beliefs,&quot; what he&#39;s really imagining is an Islam that keeps to itself and understands that it will never be in charge.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of &quot;purity and danger&quot; stuff here, too.  In this line, &quot;or do we embrace them ... and hope that we can co-opt them before they co-opt us?&quot;,  McCarthy seems to be totemically frightened of Islam, as if its mere presence could lead to cultural contamination.</p>

<p>On <a href="http://www.thebricktestament.com/" rel="nofollow">literal interpretation of sacred texts</a>, my take is that it&#39;s not so much unwise as it is impossible.  With complex multi-vocal foundational anthologies, not only do people have to decide which parts to pay attention to which parts to nod glancingly at and which parts to ignore, that have to decide how and using what tools they should interpret the parts they do pay attention to.  I&#39;ve had contemporary Muslims argue with me that polygamy is not really Islamic, because Mohammed was practical man working to reform an existing society, who wanted to promote monogamy, but knew that he needed to form alliances and could only push things so far.  That strikes me as just as literal a reading of the texts as the more standard &quot;four wives for anyone who can manage it&quot;, but one that views historical context as necessary to a literal understanding.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f33d3558970b-content"><p>I confess from the start to a horrible ignorance of Islam theology, so I can&#39;t judge the truth-value of his claim that a &quot;concrete theology of &#39;moderate Islam&#39; does not exist.&quot;</p>

<p>But *if* that is true, then McCarthy&#39;s points are fine -- but, he is then an Islamophobe (much in the same way that I&#39;m a proud fundamentalist-Christian-ophobe and Hasidic- and Conservative-Jewophobe).  </p>

<p>What he seems to be saying is that the actual living moderate Muslims are those who, unguided by any Islamic beliefs, have tempered their Islamic beliefs.  Again, that&#39;s only true if he&#39;s right that there&#39;s no moderate Islamic theology (which I suspect isn&#39;t right -- just from my rudimentary knowledge of Sufi, for instance).  </p>

<p>Ahistoricality&#39;s example of the Jews is interesting.  Spinoza, a thinker who was a profound influence on the Enlightenment, was born a Jew, but who rejected his Judaism as it rejected him.  The Jews of his time weren&#39;t liberal and tolerant, and Jewish heretics were dealt with violently.  (There is some rumor that an attempt on Spinoza&#39;s life was funded by his former synagogue.)  </p>

<p>What McCarthy is not willing to admit is that every religion, in order to fit into American political culture, has to become non-literal and reformist.  Those groups most at odds with American values -- fundamentalist Christians, Hasidic Jews, 19th c. Mormons, cults -- are the most literal, or at least, most literally conservative, faith groups out there.</p>

<p>In the end, the best reply to McCarthy would be from someone who actually knows Islamic theology and can speak to this idea that there are no moderate trends or traditions in the philosophy.  I&#39;d imagine that those medieval Muslims who translated Aristotle and invented algebra and allowed religious tolerance were informed by some theology or influenced it.</p></span>

<p>ie, even if there are moderate Muslims, they can&#39;t impose their vision of Islam universally, thus squelching the conservatives and/or extremists.</p>

<p>He wants a moderate Islamic Pope to issue an Islamic Vatican 2, basically. Since he can&#39;t have that, he sees any Muslim activity, even if moderate, as subject to being infiltrated, overruled, or overwhelmed by hostile hard-liners.</p></span>

<p>But here&#39;s something that gives the lie to his entire argument: a theological work entitled *The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists* by Dr. Khaled Abou El Fadl (see interview at <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2005/11/great-theft" rel="nofollow">http://motherjones.com/politics/2005/11/great-theft</a> ).  El Fadl argues that Wahhabism is a cult-like anomaly that only rose to power due to the power and riches of the Saudi royal family.  However, I don&#39;t think McCarthy is saying that Wahhabi is the only extreme form of Islam -- in fact, his entire argument is that all Muslim theology is extremist.  In any case, El Fadl seems to uncover many historical strains of Muslim theology that are moderate.  He was a Bush appointee, too, so McCarthy should be well aware of his work (which suggests that he&#39;s arguing in bad faith). </p></span>

<p>Extrapolating the beliefs of &quot;Jews of his time&quot; from a rumor and a non-violent edict of excommunication -- the origins of which are still obscure -- is beyond bizzare. </p>

<p>Oddly enough, McCarthy&#39;s piece seems to have been used as the first draft for yesterday&#39;s Thomas Friedman memo, deleting the self-pity and adding the trademark Friedman travel narrative. </p>

<p>What Friedman (and McCarthy) don&#39;t remember is that the transition from Unitary Christianity to mutually tolerant Christianities in Western Europe (and their colonies) was a centuries-long, unspeakably violent process that was, arguably, not complete until the 20th century. </p></span>

I don&#39;t want to make stupid generalizations about European Jews in the 16th-19th centuries, but I think it&#39;s wrong to see the Jewish communities in Europe as some sort of liberal or moderate group.  As you yourself wrote, some Jewish moderates were the result of conscious theological interpretation; some were the result of fear of Christians; some were the result of real Christian violence.  But Spinoza, in order to be a proto-Enlightenment thinker (early proponent of republican democracy, for instance), had to leave the synagogue and alienate himself from the Jewish community -- and from the Christian community as well.</p></span>

I link because of the incidental jollity contained within and created by this unspectacular performance of a weaker track off their last album. The performance is captured from the crowd by R. Todd Morason: The first memorable moment occurs at the 1:29 mark, when lead singer Matt Berninger drunkenly staggers over and begins to serenade a young girl seated on the left stage terrace. As soon as he notices her, he cleans up the lyric &quot;I won't fuck you over, I'm Mr. November&quot; for her delicate ears. Her mother snaps a picture and writes up the experience. Having two bits of demonstrable proof of so unlikely event means we are living in the future. Berninger then ambles off the stage entirely and into the crowd (2:10), at which point Morason loses him. He turns his phone to the large screens flanking the stage in an attempt to find him but fails (2:25), then pans right to survey the crowd again only to discover Berninger's about to run into him (2:33). The whole scene seems choreographed, right down to the crowd becoming a communal road crew and passing Berninger's wire above their heads.* What began as a slightly off-key performance of a mediocre song becomes the sort of spectacle we all wish every concert will be as the lights dim and the first note sounds. *Videos like this make me think the shaky cam's days as a hallmark of televisual realism are numbered. The autocorrection function in cheap new cameras steadies all hands to the point where, in ten years, people will wonder why they let cinematographers continue rolling while in the midst of epileptic fits.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/08/history-is-what-you-make-of-it.html"><span><strong>History is what you make of it?</strong> Johann Hari's review of Wolf: The Lives of Jack London suggests that its author, James Haley, says nothing about its subject that has not been long known.* The only people who would be surprised by the facts of Jack London's life and life of mind, then, are those who know nothing about him, like Ilya Somin, who uses the occasion of Hari's review to condemn the group he describes as &quot;early 20th century Progressives,&quot; claiming London’s simultaneous advocacy of racism and socialism was no anomaly among early 20th century Progressives. Was London a racist and a socialist? Absolutely. Did he believe in progress? He did. Did he align himself with the Progressives? He absolutely did not.** Not only did he despise the lukewarm commitment of populists like Williams Jenning Bryan to the socialist cause, he publicly quarreled with the Progressive Party's one and only Presidential candidate, Theodore Roosevelt, five years earlier, when the then President declared him a &quot;nature fakir&quot; after reading his account of a lynx killing a dog-wolf. Far from being a Progressive standard-bearer, London couldn't even agree with this lot about the finer points of dog psychology. The first problem with Somin's argument, then, is that he applies the term &quot;Progressive&quot; to someone who was an avowed &quot;Socialist.&quot; London was a capital-S Socialist who believed in lowercase-p progress, but he was not a capital-P Progressive. Teddy Roosevelt was a capital-P Progressive, but he didn't believe in progress and was neither a socialist nor a Socialist. These are distinctions with difference to everyone who cares more about history than contemporary politics. They must be made to obtain. The second problem with Somin's argument is that its logic lacks logic. Smudging your greasy fingers on the glasses of history only obscures your view of its record: The racist elements of Progressive ideology don’t prove that economic interventionism is racist by nature, or that the policies Progressives defended in large part on racist grounds can’t be justified in other ways. Still less do they prove that modern left-wingers are necessarily racist as well. But they do undercut claims that racism is primarily a product of the “right” and that economic leftism and racial progress necessarily go together. Proving that Jack London was a racist only proves that Jack London was a racist. It weakly suggests, and then only by extension, that those who shared his ideological commitment to socialism—which, it bears repeating, is only the same thing as Progressivism if you consider Teddy Roosevelt a socialist—might be racist. What it does not and can never prove is anything at all about people who were not London and did not share his beliefs. Anyone who thinks otherwise was likely also impressed by Jonah Goldberg's masterful Liberal Fascism: Two Words Next To Each Other, and deserves to be taken about as a seriously. *Part of the reason that the details of London's life are already familiar is that, as he wrote S.S. McClure at the beginning of his career, “[he] took the...</span></a></div>
