I want to know how Americans mangled his thought during the &quot;Nietzsche vogue&quot; of 1897-1908. (Those dates aren't as random as they seem, but I lack sufficient energy to justify my bracketing.) A Polaroid of this fissure between intellectuals (like Adam) and intellectual historians (like Yours Truly) looks something like this: intellectuals are more interested in the causes than their effects, whereas intellectual historians are more interested in the effects than their causes. So how did Americans mangle Nietzsche during his very own vogue? Arthur Allin's review of Alexander Tille's Von Nietzsche bis Darwin (1897) in The Journal of American Psychology neatly captures both the common misinterpretations and the shrill tone with which they were voiced: Nietzsche, the erratic, the eccentric, the aphoristic and the modern oracular Zarathurstrian, is for [Tille] the high-water mark of the tide which has been rising so steadily since Darwin’s days. Spencer, Leslie Stephen, Wundt, Huxley, Fiske, Williams, Bebel and others are shown to be so many landscapes on the road to Nietzsche. The trend of thought is, of course, biological and evolutionary. The Abermensch, the Beyond-Man, is the continued goal. A race of laughing lions is coming, strong men full of deeds and vigor. The cry is not Repent! but the true Metanoia, change of life and conduct; not so much humility and penance, as Grecian valor and Roman virtus. A high aristocratic Herrenclasse, the product of natural selection is his ideal. Consumptives must not marry. Only the fittest must survive.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/unwitting_tuesd.html"><span><strong>Unwitting Tuesday Hatred II; or Susurrus from a Broken Bullhorn</strong> Yesterday Michael Bérubé (Michael Bérubé!) declared If I came across a job candidate with a blog like this or this, or this, or this, or this, or this (jus t to take a half dozen at random), I’d be impressed, and if the rest of the candidate’s materials looked as good, I’d want to interview him or her ... because I’m very, very partial to people who write smart stuff. (Click on that first &quot;this&quot; and experience instant déjà vu.) So I'm the sort of scholar Michael would not not hire if I applied for a position at Penn on the condition that &quot;the rest of [my] materials looked as good.&quot; This contingent stamp of approval is a little alarming because, to be frank, I don't know how the rest of my materials look (and am a little confused as to what my &quot;materials&quot; would be). I have one potentially forthcoming essay...but it's been &quot;potentially forthcoming&quot; since I sent in revisions well over three years ago. Last year I mustered gumption enough to email the guest editor of the issue my essay would've appear in and heard back almost immediately. Not from him, mind you, but from an automated messaging service letting me know that Dr. _____ is currently vacationing in France and will return my message promptly upon his return. That was last November. Either his position puts the sin in sinecure or he's avoiding me, in which case I should abandon all hope of that article ever being published. But even if I were to publish it elsewhere, I don't think it'd be part of my &quot;materials.&quot; (It concerns a field I no longer work in and employs an approach I no longer condone.) So what else is there? The chapters of my dissertation that I'll eventually publish as articles in the field's flagship journals. (Some of which, I recently discovered, now syndicate their contents. That's why the latest issue of American Literary History and American Literature are now available on my left sidebar.) But all I can count on at this point is a finished dissertation and my teaching experience. I've taught or TA'd a variety of courses (some of which were cross-listed with Comparative Literature and Criticism) including Introduction to Irish Modernism (self-explanatory), Modern Youth (a course in which the kids queered 2oth Century bildungsromans after reading a healthy dose of Freud and Foucault), and Covering Elections (a hybrid literature and journalism class concerning the history of election coverage since 1960). I've also taught numerous lower-division Introduction to the Novel and Introduction to Drama courses, as well as five or six Introduction to Literary Journalisms. By the time I hit the market I'll also have team-taught The Ethics and Evolution of Literary Journalism (an upper-division course) with Pulitzer Prize-winning author Barry Siegel. I strongly suspect none of that will matter when I hit the market because I haven't published anything yet. Still, in terms of the originality of its research, my dissertation should belong to the...</span></a></div>
