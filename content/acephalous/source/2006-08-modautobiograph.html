<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067972463X/diesekoschmar-20/"><em>The Autobiography of Alice B.

<p>I know what you're thinking: &quot;No one would actually confuse the two, so why press the point?&quot;&nbsp; I press because I care ... and because otherwise brilliant writers have confused these modes in meaningful ways.&nbsp; In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156619180/diesekoschmar-20/"><em>Moments of Being</em></a>, Virginia Woolf wrote</p><blockquote><p>So [Crusoe] proses on, drawing, little by little, <em>his own portrait</em>, so that we never forget it. </p></blockquote>

<p>The emphasis is mine, and you can guess its import.&nbsp; I inserted &quot;Crusoe&quot; in that sentence because the italicized phrase vanquishes the idea that the antecedent of &quot;he&quot; is &quot;Defoe.&quot;&nbsp; What happened here?&nbsp; What confused Woolf?**&nbsp; I would argue that she missed what Stein, with her unsubtle pronomial slippage in the final sentence there, exploited in the passage I quoted earlier:</p><blockquote><p><em>I</em> am going to write it as simply as Defoe did the autobiography of Robinson Crusoe and <em>she</em> has and this is it.</p></blockquote><p>Stein records herself declaring her intentions, then switches back into Toklas' voice.&nbsp; In lieu of a conclusion, however, I will leave you with a suggestive (not to mention my favorite) passage from Stein's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1878972081/diesekoschmar-20/"><em>Everybody's Autobiography</em></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Identity is funny being yourself is funny as you are never yourself to yourself except as you remember yourself and then of course you do not believe yourself ... you do not really believe yourself why should you, you know so well so very well that it is not yourself, it could not be yourself because you cannot remember right and if you do remember right it does not sound right and of course it does not sound right because it is not right.&nbsp; You are of course never yourself.</p></blockquote><p>The title alone should indicate why it piqued my interest.&nbsp; Tomorrow, I'll discuss this passage, Woolf's &quot;A Sketch of the Past,&quot; Walter Benjamin's &quot;The Storyteller,&quot; and Emile Benveniste's <em>Problems in General Linguistics</em>.***<br /> </p>

<p>* yes I said yes I can Yes.</p>

<p>** Admittedly, these were unfinished essays published posthumously, so she may have caught the slip in future edits.&nbsp; Still, the slip itself is significant enough to warrant attention.</p>

<p>*** And unlike most blog-promises, I'll live up to this one.&nbsp; Why should you believe me?&nbsp; I've already written it.&nbsp; So this isn't a promise to do <em>more </em>work—which should never be believed, especially of a blogger—but a promise to post what I've <em>already</em> written.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I understand where you&#39;re headed with this, Scott. Woolf means, I think, that RC is written in the first person. Sure, there&#39;s the word &quot;prose&quot; - but that&#39;s a word that&#39;s open to just this sort of playfulness. </p>

<p>Of course, with Woolf&#39;s own works, and in her period more broadly considered, this whole deal becomes much more complicated, via free indirect discourse. What was Kenner&#39;s definition of the Uncle Charles Principle? </p>

<p>&quot;&quot;Writing fiction, [Joyce] played parts, and referred stylistic decisions to the taste of the person he was playing. The Uncle Charles Principle entails writing about someone as they would choose to be written about.&quot; <br />

		<span id="comment-21670773-content"><p>Scott, I&#39;m agreeing with CR here.  Woolf implicitly draws the distinction between actual and asserted author.  In *Crusoe*, the reader must go along with the illusion that the text *is* an autobiography (or whatever the name of that genre would have had at the time).</p>

<p>By Stein&#39;s time, the conventions of an autobiography are well-established, although I don&#39;t know about how far back the history of ghostwritten autobiographies stretches (a quick wikipedia search brings up Lovecraft&#39;s ghostwriting of autobiographies of Houdini and others).  Stein is drawing attention to autobiography as a set of linguistic and narrative constructions -- an act of titling, of using &quot;I,&quot; of asserting not only the truth but the personal ownership and &quot;authorization&quot; of a particular plot.  So that later we&#39;ll get *Anybody&#39;s Autobiography*.  </p>

<p>Proust would seem to be an odder figure here.  Ron Silliman has recently blogged about the difference between Joyce&#39;s and Faulkner&#39;s streams of consciousness: the former is interested in an overall critique of modes of representation, the latter is interested in shaping characters.  Proust is simply weird.  His novels are novels, full of manufactured people, places, and events.  But so much of the detail seems to be only of interest to a reader if the narrator is assumed to be a real person.  In pure invented narrative, we go by the Chekhov rule: every detail must contribute to the unified effect and thematic structure of the narrative.  But in Proust, we&#39;re in the world of Barthes&#39; &quot;reality effect,&quot; only turned up to eleven, so that certain details and passages seem to signify nothing more than &quot;treat me as real&quot; -- all fine and good, except the work is fiction.  </p>

<p>Am I making sense?      </p></span>

		<span id="comment-21671728-content"><p>I&#39;m not denying anyone their playfulness.  In fact, I&#39;m drawing attention to it, hence my remarks about the &quot;playful attempts to stabalize identity&quot; in that first paragraph (and calling &quot;Penelope&quot; &quot;<i>her</i> internal monologue).  What happened was I wrote a post the size of Texas, one no one would read, so I chopped it into fourths.  This is the first of them.</p>

<p>Luther, you have ruined the show a bit, though.  Your point about what Stein&#39;s up to with pronouns is where I begin tomorrow with the Beneviste.  As I&#39;ll say tomorrow, in reference (variously) to Joyce, Stein, Woolf and Defoe, is that they all &quot;establish their linguistic subjectivity through what Emile Benveniste calls &#39;the act of individual discourse&#39; in Problems in General Linguistics: &#39;I refers to the act of individual discourse in which it is pronounced [and] cannot be identified except in what [he has] called elsewhere an instance of discourse and that has only a momentary reference&#39; (226).&quot;  Actually, that they play with that assumption as they transform &quot;chronicle&quot; into &quot;narrative&quot; (as with Stein in particular, but Molly too); as you can see, I could&#39;ve gone with Benjamin or Hayden White here, but Benjamin fits the modernist moment and mood better.  (Call it &quot;the historicist creep.&quot;)</p>

<p>Also, the Woolf is certainly a slip, but I think it&#39;s a telling one, even if it is in an unfinished draft.  At a basic, not-quite-unreflective but not-quite-entirely-critical, this basic error in attribution remains powerful enough to cause Woolf to nod.  </p>

<p>Anyhow, I lied about this being the first of four parts.  It&#39;s the first of three parts in desperate need of a fourth...which I hope to come up with before someone demands I post it.  </p></span>

(The review at Retrospectacle covers all the bases.) Yet, despite its clarity, something about it unsettled me from the very first sentence: The question of how an animal develops has preoccupied humans since Antiquity. (1) I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but something about that sentence seemed ... wrong. Fascinated by the material, I pressed on and encountered: In 1827, German-Estonian biologist Karl Ernst von Baer (1792-1876) described the first human egg cell that was derived from a young woman who had drowned after a wild night. (11) Maybe it's because I'm a literary studies guy, but I had a visceral reaction to the word &quot;derived&quot; in that sentence. One does not &quot;derive&quot; an egg cell from &quot;a young woman who had drowned after a wild night.&quot; However, I realized that the coldness of that sentence wouldn't be mitigated by the first alternative which sprung to mind: &quot;harvest.&quot; That sounded equally inhumane. What struck me about that sentence was the manner in which it tossed the dead body deep into subordination: In 1827, German-Estonian biologist Karl Ernst von Baer (subject) described (verb) the first human egg cell (direct object) that (new clause!) was derived (passive!) from (first prepositional phrase!) a young woman (anonymous!) who had drowned (adjectival clause!) after (second preprositional phrase!) a wild night (cliché!). As I poured over this sentence in a frantic attempt to discover the source of my unease, I had an epiphany. I flipped back and scoured the cover, the title page, the first two pages of acknowledgments ... nothing. Finally, on the verge of surrendering, I decided to read the fine print. Wouldn't you know it? There, in tiny print, just above the Library of Congress information, I found my grail: Helga Schier, Ph.D., Translator from the original German I suppose this must represent the emphasis of the sciences on the content of the work, but I still find the lack of announcement off-putting. I am far more forgiving of a translated work than I am of an abundantly awkward one. Until I'd reached page 90 of Coming to Life, I was regularly upset by the awkwardness of the prose; the second I realized it was a translation, my enjoyment increased ten-fold. I'd freed my mind to address the ideas and ignore the stilted prose. If only I could've done so sooner ...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/08/modernist_autob.html"><span><strong>Modernist Autobiography: Part, um, Hiatus ... So Why Not Hate on Shakespeare?</strong> The perils of cross-posting! I'm going to hold off on publishing the second part of my exagmination round these factifications for incamination of my work in progress, lest I appear to hog that most venerable, Valvular platform. (A Southern boy can only call so much attention to himself before demurring.) In the meantime, I present an excerpt from an interview with Frank Kermode I'll discuss at greater length later this week. (This line of research inspired by the new interview with him in The Guardian.) This passage addresses why Americans (including Greenblatt) teach Shakespeare terribly: There is danger which threatens Shakespeare at all times. The worst of them is a kind of sentimentality, I think. But we have been bombarded with biographies these days. There is one in full public attention at the moment, [Stephen] Greenblatt’s Will in the World, which of course is intelligent but still sentimental, I think. There is this feeling that you can say almost anything as long as it is rather loving about Shakespeare. And I have always thought as a teacher, one needs to be able to say that Shakespeare is often a very bad writer. Kermode sounds innocent enough here, but he says of Greenblatt a bit later: Well, of course he is an exceedingly clever man, a great ability, great intellectual power, I think. But sometimes, as I have labored to demonstrate, very often simply wrong.</span></a></div>
