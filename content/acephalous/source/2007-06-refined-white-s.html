<p>That is the title of the letter &quot;The Ghost of Adolph Rupp&quot; sent to
members of the UCI community.&nbsp; Seems I am now a white supremacist. 
That said, as someone who writes and comments under his own name, I'm
not particularly worried.&nbsp; I comported myself on that thread as I
always do.&nbsp; For the record:</p>

<p>I am <em>not </em>a white supremacist, nor am I an <em>enabler </em>of white supremacy.&nbsp; I <em>am </em>interested in the historical and rhetorical context of race in American culture.&nbsp; (I've taught <a href="http://www.ags.uci.edu/%7Eskaufman/teaching/saved%20as%20html/english%2028C%20fall%202002%20syllabus.htm">two</a> <a href="http://www.ags.uci.edu/%7Eskaufman/teaching/saved%20as%20html/english%2028C%20spring%202002%20syllabus.htm">courses</a> on the subject.)&nbsp; And I <em>am </em>interested
in the context of online rhetoric.&nbsp; This particular thread fascinated
me because it intersects with many of my scholarly interests.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But it will probably be the last time I attempt a discussion of
these interests online, because you never know when the person across
from you will decide it's time to notify your superiors that they have
a white supremacist among them.&nbsp; (Even though they don't.)&nbsp; </p>

<p>Although it will cause me personal inconvenience, I do hope the
people who received this email take it seriously.&nbsp; Accusations of
hate-speech and race-based discrimination should be investigated, so
that when the complaints are <em>legitimate </em>they can be dealt with
accordingly.&nbsp; Just because someone took the time to craft an
inaccurate, slanderous letter painting me as white supremacist does not
mean that all such letters will be inaccurate and slanderous. </p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">Mr. Kaufman launched 
his support of white supremacist language on an <strong>ABC affiliate</strong> 
in his comments in a Thursday 7 June 2007 thread at patriotboy's blog. 
Patriotboy titled this thread: <em>&quot;Getting Serious for a Moment.&quot; </em><a title="http://www.patriotboy.blogspot.com/" href="http://www.patriotboy.blogspot.com/">http://www.patriotboy.blogspot.com/</a></span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">Mr. Kaufman commented under 
the pseudonym <em>&quot;SEK.&quot; </em> <em>&nbsp;</em>Mr. Kaufman</span><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"> buttressed his enabling of white 
supremacist language by identifying himself as an &quot;<em>academic.&quot;&nbsp; </em>Mr. 
Kaufman frequently invited readers to his web site. His site unambiguoulsy 
identifies him as a UCI lecturer.&nbsp; Mr. Kaufman repeatedly criticized all who 
disagreed with him, because <em>&quot;we&quot;</em> did not properly understand the 
<strong><em>&quot;context&quot; </em></strong>of white supremacist language posted on an 
<strong>ABC affiliate's</strong> blog. Mr. Kaufman ignored numerous reminders 
that <strong>ABC</strong> and its <strong>affiliates</strong> transmit over 
<strong>publicly owned</strong> airwaves. Mr. Kaufman ignored reminders of Janet 
Jackson's &quot;<em>wardrobe malfunction,&quot; </em>and Don Imus' characterizations of 
the Rutgers' Women's Basketball team. If Mr. Kaufman had not been so completely 
dismissive of so many who tried to point out that it was he, who was missing the 
wider <em>&quot;context,&quot; </em>I never would have felt compelled to contact so many 
at UCI. Mr. Kaufman refuses to acknowledge that he has inserted himself in the 
<em>&quot;context&quot;</em> of other acamedicians who have <strong>enabled</strong> white 
supremacy, <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger</a></span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">Mr. Kaufman assumes a 
middle ground with respect to the transmission of white supremacist language 
that does not exist. He is either actively educating against the massive 
ignorance that undergirds all &quot;<em>white supremacy,&quot; </em>or he is 
<strong>enabling </strong>tolerance of it.&nbsp; It's a zero-sum game and I think I 
am being kind to Mr. Kaufman, a Ph.D. graduate student, by referring to him only 
as an <em>enabler</em>. </span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">Dr. Quanbeck, among other 
things, I am requesting that you (and others copied on this) consider that Mr. 
Kaufman has already initiated a process which will pull UCI in his 
&quot;<em>context.&quot; </em>That's why I copied UCI's Development Office. I doubt that 
they are anxious to hear Mr. Kaufman's name on a fundraising call. I doubt Mr. 
Kaufman considered their <em>&quot;context&quot; </em>when he lobbied so aggressively in 
favor of posting white supremacist language on an <strong>ABC 
affiliates's</strong> website.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman">I have also copied Congresswoman Maxine 
Waters' Chief of Staff, <a title="mailto:mikael.moore@mail.house.gov" href="mailto:mikael.moore@mail.house.gov">Mikael Moore</a>. I am sorry to admit 
that I was largely ignorant of what a rare gift Congresswoman Waters is to our 
great nation, until I began reading Jane Hamsher's blog, FireDogLake. I have 
also faxed a copy of this email to Alice A. Huffman, the President of the 
California Office of the <strong>NAACP</strong>. I have also copied the 
<em>California Universities Consortium,</em> because they are committed to 
advancing diversity in California education. I am inviting everyone copied on 
this to share their assessment of Mr. Kaufman's understanding of 
&quot;<em>context</em>&quot; with Mr. Kaufman. It is my sincere hope that this 
&quot;<em>sharing</em>&quot; takes place&nbsp; individually and institutionally.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman">I have also copied <strong>UCI's student 
newspaper.</strong> I hope they see fit to report on Mr. Kaufman's advocacy 
for white supremacist language displayed on an ABC affiliate. Another issue is 
that Mr. Kaufman appears to have a lot of time available for blogging. I suspect 
that a large portion of Mr. Kaufman's funding comes directly from the 
taxpayers.&nbsp; I think a very wide spectrum of UCI students will be very interested 
in his understanding of &quot;context.&quot;&nbsp; I raised issues very similar to these with 
Mr. Kaufman on the thread and he repeatedly and explicity 
welcomed them.&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman">I also copied <em>&quot;Ethics at UCI.&quot;</em> 
</span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">Below, I have quoted some 
of Mr. Kaufman's routinely banal comments, but I would urge everyone to read 
his comments in their entirety. Bold is mine:</span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><em>&quot;I'm interested in this 
affair for </em></span><a title="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/panel_podcast.html" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/panel_podcast.html" rel="nofollow"><span title="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/panel_podcast.html" face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><em>other, 
call them &quot;academic&quot; reasons</em></span></a><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">.&quot; [...]</span><br /><br /><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><em>&quot;Yes, random people can read it; 
however, random people should do their due diligence, as it is incumbent upon 
them to understand a statement before responding to it. (And yes, 
<strong>context </strong>is a vital part of understanding.)&quot;</em></span></p>

<p>I wrote this to Mr. 
Kaufman:<em> &quot;You're enabling an incredibly vile example of refined white 
supremacy.&quot; </em><br /><br />He responded: <em>&quot;...Just because the <strong>context 
</strong>is invisible to you does not mean that white supremacy has been 
enabled.&quot; [...]</em></p>

<p>Mr. Kaufman is also 
sickeningly quick to cast himself as the victim of <em>&quot;bigotry</em>:&quot; 
</p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><em>&quot;And is you bringing up 
that I'm from the South an attempt to score points with the members of this 
crowd who believe the citizens of Louisiana are sub-human dreck? What's with the 
odd bigotry against Southerners here?&quot; [...]</em></span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">Here Mr. Kaufman criticizes 
me for not being more tolerant of an <strong>ABC affiliate</strong> posting and 
linking white supremacist language. <em>&nbsp;</em></span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><em>&quot;I think I've made

position clear here from the beginning</em></span></a><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><em>. In fact, before I was drawn 
into this idiotic pissing context with Ghost, I stated precisely </em></span><a title="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/patriotboy/3947160929673603317/#422830" href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/patriotboy/3947160929673603317/#422830" rel="nofollow"><span title="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/patriotboy/3947160929673603317/#422830" face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><em>what 
horses I had in the race</em></span></a><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><em>. I have no position here to 
nuance, or to shift from, other than the simple fact that there was a 
miscommunication in context. The General admits as much. Why you can't let it 
go, Ghost, is beyond me.&quot; [...]</em></span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">This was Mr. Kaufman's 
first response <strong>after</strong> I informed him that I would be sharing his 
comments with UCI. </span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><em>&quot;And why, exactly, are 
you going to do this? Have I engaged in any sort of harassment? Have I in any 
way, shape, or form endorsed Smantix's vile obituary? As I stated from the 
beginning, I have an interest how online interactions are framed. People in my 
department know that. People at the university know that. You can re-inform them 
of it if you'd like.&quot;</em></span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">Later, he wrote this: 
</span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><em>&quot;You're going to inform 
my institution that I'm interested in the context of online interactions? They 
already know that.

very topic</em></span></a><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><em> 
at the largest academic conference for English professors a mere six months ago. 
Last month, I participated in </em></span><a title="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/the_most_import.html" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/the_most_import.html" rel="nofollow"><span title="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/the_most_import.html" face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><em>a

interested in the context of online interactions. I'm confused as to what you 
think you'd accomplish here. [...]</em></span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><em>So what you intend, 
then, is to re-inform people in my department of what they already know? You can 
see why I'm confused.&quot; [...]</em></span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">
<p><em>That said, I find the threat <strong>childish,</strong> but if you 
really want to follow through with it, I can't stop you. I'm sure people in my 
department will take the word of a dead basketball coach very, very seriously. 
(Or wait, will you drop the veil of pseudonymity and complain under your own 
name? If you do, I'll take the high ground and not reveal your identity. I'm no 
tattler.) </em></p>
<p>Bold is mine. </p>
<p>If anyone finds my concerns about Mr. Walker's position <em>&quot;childish,&quot; 
</em>please email me. </p>
<p>Dr. Quanbech, aside from your Office, I simply plucked email addresses very 
randomly off of UCI departments that I thought might be most sensitive to the 
<strong>grave injury </strong>that white supremacist language represents to the 
United States and the world<strong>.</strong> I would hope that those copied on 
this would feel very free to copy others on this email. . </p>
<p>A sub-topic of my discussions with Mr. Kaufman included comments about 
<em>&quot;refined&quot;</em> white supremacy versus other forms of it.&nbsp; Again Mr. Kaufman 
was unwilling or unable to admit how much more lethal white supremacist 
language is when wielded by people who are highly proficient with respect to the 
use of language, or those that are credentialed by society, as teachers are. 
 </p>
<p>I would invite all copied on this to consider that the only lesson Mr. 
Kaufman may learn out of this is to not reveal his identity or place of work. 
I certainly hope that this can bring about some kind of <em>&quot;conversion,&quot;</em> 
for Mr. Kaufman. In my opinion, he owes an apology to the family of Steve 
Gilliard. I would hope that Mr. Kaufman would find some way to make 
<strong>substantial restitution </strong>to people who have been injured by the 
kind of of refined white supremacist language that he wants posted on an 
<strong>ABC affiliate</strong>. There's no shortage of victims and I have found 
that apologies untethered by restitution tend to be ephemeral. </p></span></p></blockquote>

		<span id="comment-72235072-content"><p>This may seem a bit convoluted, but perhaps not quite as convoluted as the letter in question. Consider this: what you have here is a conservative student doing what he believes to be a parody of the &#39;hand-wringing liberal,&#39; in hopes of making trouble for an instructor he considers to be far too liberal.</p>

<p>The first &#39;false note&#39; that jumped out for me was: &quot;I am sorry to admit that I was largely ignorant of what a rare gift Congresswoman Waters is to our great nation, until I began reading Jane Hamsher&#39;s blog, FireDogLake.&quot; (All that needs is a &#39;BWAHAHA&#39; after it.)</p>

		<span id="comment-72236728-content"><p>&quot;In law, defamation is the communication of a statement that makes a false claim, expressly stated or implied to be factual, that may harm the reputation of an individual, business, product, group, government or nation.&quot;</p>

<p>This letter&#39;s repeated description of your comments as &quot;support of white supremacist language&quot; not only makes false implications, but is expressly false - at no point do you support the language, merely the choice to link to it.  This isn&#39;t even a matter of misinterpretation or misunderstanding as it was in the Gilbert incident.  This is a deliberate misrepresentation of your position.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope that this letter will be recognized as defamation by its recipients.  However, given the large number of alleged recipients and the alarmist tone of the letter, I have to admit I&#39;m slightly concerned.  In the event that you should suffer any harm as a result of this letter, I think you most likely have a legal case against &quot;the Ghost of Adolph Rupp.&quot;  Even though the letter was sent pseudonymously, he has an IP address.  Your willingness not to &quot;tattle&quot; is admirable, but there are legal protections against defamation designed to protect you and others from these exact situations.</p></span>

<p>So I wonder whether you&#39;ve deleted the guy&#39;s real name off the letter, Scott.  You write &quot;If you do, I&#39;ll take the high ground and not reveal your identity. I&#39;m no tattler.&quot;  Well, in cases of extreme stupidity / calculated provocation such as this letter represents, I have an interest in finding out whether it is amateur (stupidity) or professional (provocation).  Should I file a FOIA request for a copy of this public communication?  Or can you tell us in general what kind of person turns up when you Google the name.</p></span>

I was involved in a similar situation back in &#39;98, when a professor at my undergraduate institution, denied tenure, started sending me harassing emails.  When I responded angrily (and vulgarly), he threatened to send my email to the chair of my graduate department.  To cover my ass, I sent a preemptive email to my chair that, while defending myself, made me look like an idiot for being involved in such a pissing contest.  So personally, I&#39;d ignore all this unless someone at UCI makes it an issue.  </p>

Inform them that I blog? I'm not sure. I admit to being baffled by the threat of tattling. Is this a common tactic among online leftists? I wouldn't think so—I'm a leftist frequently online, and I've never considered contacting someone's employer—but it seems to be happening everywhere now. Scrolling through my comments in that thread, I'm trying to identify which reprehensible thing I said this person will include in his missive. Maybe it was this: When people emerge from the woodwork claiming that the link-as-endorsement policy isn't operative on a particular blog, it means that the basic context ... has been misunderstood. Imagine a situation in which Blogger X posts a link and excerpt to every antisemitic slur written by Author Z. When a prominent Jew dies, this person posts a link and excerpt to despicable obituary Author Z wrote. A friend of the prominent Jew sees Blogger X's post and starts a campaign to have Blogger X fired. Would you say that the friend of the prominent Jew did his due diligence? Do you not shudder at the thought that you could be fired on the basis of someone else's ignorance? Perhaps my quick take on Speech Act Theory offended: Context is part of the meaning of any statement. If a waiter at an Italian restaurant asks if I would like some cheese on my pasta, I could reply &quot;I do.&quot; I utter those exact same words in another context, I enter into a legally binding agreement to have and hold someone so long as we both shall live. I stress the notion of due diligence here because, well, because I don't want to marry my waiter or ask my wife-to-very-soon-be for cheese. It could have been my disgusting opinion on racism: You missed my subtle point. All racism is vile. Some of it is criminal too, and it can lead to amorality, but vile is vile. No need to be all nuanced about it. Now that I think about it, though, it must have been my refusal to engage him in a debate about the history of racial politics in America. I mean, he spent all that time &quot;teaching&quot; me things I already know, and I didn't respond to them for the simple fact that they were irrelevant? I'm surprised he's stopping with my department. Why not just contact the FBI already?</span></a></div>

Thanks to the tireless efforts of &quot;anonymous,&quot; I have reason to believe he is the same &quot;John Casper&quot; who frequently comments at FireDogLake. I have contacted the General and the writers of FDL requesting IP addresses but have yet to hear back. Please email me (scotterickaufman [at] gmail [dot] com) if you have any information about the identity of &quot;John Casper&quot; or &quot;The Ghost of Adolph Rupp.&quot; UPDATE HERE.</span></a></div>
