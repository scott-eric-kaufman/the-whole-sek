        <meta name="description" content="Like many others, I'll be heading home for the holidays, then to the MLA after them, so expect posting to be pretty light—wait—what's that? I'm not headed home for the holidays? What do you mean I put my wife on an airplane and sent to her to my parents' house this morning? Why would I do that? Why wouldn't I go with her? A sick cat? Could that really put all my holiday plans on hold? Of course it could. So while my wife is off being feted by my parents, I'm stuck at home with a little lady who may need to have some toes amputated. That's the bad news. The good news is that cats have their toes amputated quite regularly in the States, so the surgery (if necessary) will be routine. Quick Clarification: I'm not wantonly declawing Rachel. She has tumors growing on three of the toes of her back left paw, which the vet removed yesterday and is testing today. The reason she stopped eating and drinking a month back was because the litter in the litter box hurt her toes. That's why she ended up with a distended bladder. The pain medication and appetite stimulant she'd been taking masked the pain, but apparently it got too bad again this weekend. I took her back to the vet and we found the tumors. Thing is, she had a full-body scan a month ago, and the vet pulled it up on the monitor and we looked and looked and looked for sign of the tumors, but we couldn't find any. The foot must've been uncomfortable to her before modern medicine could detect the tumors. So all the problems seem to have stemmed from these toes—the not eating, the not voiding, the lethargy, and she also lost a pound, which for a cat is 1/10th of total body weight. All because of her toes." />

<p>A <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/11/the-cat-post.html">sick cat</a>?&nbsp; Could that really put all my holiday plans on hold?</p>

Wow, not only do bad things like cancer happen to you, they also happen to your cat. It&#39;s like your orbit of doom.  But you have a crowd rooting for Team Kaufman!</p>

<p>I do hope that Rachel feels better and that you get to go to the MLA and hopefully see your family at some point!</p>

<p>Though, does this mean you might be up for hanging out around I-Town?  </p></span>

<p>Mikhail, of course cats have toes.  You think God would stick fingers on their feet?</p>

<p>Belle, I&#39;m equally unable to hang out because I have to keep a close eye on Rachel.  (Plus, I&#39;m taking the opportunity of the Littlewomedievalist&#39;s absence to work, work, work, work, work, work, work long into the night.  I figure if I play my cards right, I can finish the dissertation before Christmas.)</p>

The names and ethnicities of politicians strive to shock but elicit nothing but groans. There will never be a President Osama bin Reebok, III. Nor will &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; ever accompany Madame President Wendy Shorty-Muhammad into the corridors of power. I understand why science fiction writers want their future to reflect the marginal values of the present, but there will never be a President who sells half his name to a shoe company or spent her formative years in porn. (There might be a Muslim President one day, but years of poorly thought out speculative fiction make the name difficult to consider soberly.) Similarly, pharmacies of the future will not stock medication with names like &quot;Happitol&quot; or &quot;Blissbutrin.&quot; People will not ask their pharmacist whether &quot;Breathix&quot; is right for them, or what the recommended dosage of &quot;Muscledrine&quot; is. Medications will not be &quot;cleverly&quot; christened. Actual people don't need the Head-On Apply-Directly-to-the-Forehead approach to naming medications. Except apparently they do. Seems I'm wrong about the future. The present too, for that matter: On page 40 of the latest issue of Rolling Stone appears a phrase straight out of bad science fiction: &quot;President Barack Hussein Obama.&quot; A year ago that phrase would've clunked like so much speculative overkill. (&quot;A President whose name almost rhymes with 'Osama'? Not likely. We'll see Little Oral Annie in the Rose Garden first.&quot;) Page 41 of the latest issue of Rolling Stone consists entirely of an ad for Abilify, the latest and most ghastly named entrant into the already crowded field of antidepressants. (Possible side effects include &quot;an inner sense of restlessness or need to move,&quot; but be careful, because Abilify &quot;can affect your judgment and motor skills,&quot; so if you need to move avoid cars and heavy machinery. Don't ask anyone for a ride either, because Abilify may cause permanent abnormal and incontrollable facial movements that send people the wrong signal.) All of which is only to say that while the future may be now, it lacks imagination. It could've been so much better, if only we'd applied some Thought-On Directly Where It Reels ...</span></a></div>
