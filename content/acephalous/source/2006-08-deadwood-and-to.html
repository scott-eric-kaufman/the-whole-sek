        <meta name="description" content="On Unfogged the other day, we had a long, productive conversation about the merits of Deadwood. (I presented my case rather better there than I have before, but I still dig Sean’s more.) We can continue that conversation, but I actually want to have another one, based on Ogged’s latest post, in which he claims that: just as the dialogue in NYPD Blue seemed cool and edgy at the time, and now seems like a strained attempt at mimicking tough-guy culture, I think the dialogue on Deadwood will seem simliarly stupid in several years. Why do I want to parallel a conversation from there over here? Do I think I can compete? No, of course not. But I think the best response to him lies in our domain: namely, that NYPD Blue‘s language was stylized, whereas Deadwood‘s is literary. To that end, I present—below the fold, as this is a family blog—the line of dialogue we discussed before Ogged’s latest post: Ellsworth: I’ll tell you what: I may have fucked my life up flatter than hammered shit, but I stand here before you today beholden to no human cocksucker. Why does that sentence work? My best guess: The “I’ll tell you what” is conventional enough. Only, which convention does it partake of here? Is it the quiet, conspiratorial “I’ll tell you what” salesmen whisper when they want to do us a favor and throw in the top coat for an extra $400? (They’ll have to run it by their manager.) If it is, the “tell” and “what,” the speech and its content, would be emphasized; the “I” and “you” would sink, unstressed, in order to abnegate responsibility for the fucking “I’m” about to do to “you.” That doesn’t seem to work. So, how about the one in which the stresses fall drunkenly on the first and third beats? “I’ll tell you what” embraces the responsibility for the beating “I” declare, for all to hear, that “I’m” gonna put on “you.” This works much, much better. Such statements should, by law or enforced custom, incite terrible violence ... only this one doesn’t. Instead, we’re treated to a somber but forceful self-introspection. Ellsworth, we learn, “fucked [his] life up flatter than hammered shit.” Look at mess of alliteration and assonance there. We have the f sounds stumbling in and out of “fucked,” “life” and “flatter.” Notice how the poetic trickery staples the phrase together. The fə occurs in “fucked” and draws “life” and “up” together, almost into a single word (li-fəp), uniting life up with that what’s been fucked. You know, life. The third f introduces the next sound, what linguists call the “near-open, front unrounded&quot;) æ which occurs in the word which best describes it: “flat.” The flæ pulls together the alliterative fs with the assonant æs.

</p>
<blockquote><p>just as the dialogue in <em>NYPD Blue</em> seemed cool and
edgy at the time, and now seems like a strained attempt at mimicking
tough-guy culture, I think the dialogue on <em>Deadwood</em> will seem simliarly stupid in several years.</p></blockquote>

<p>
Why do I want to parallel a conversation from there over here?&nbsp; <em>Do I think I can compete?</em>&nbsp; No, of course not.&nbsp; But I think the best response to him lies in our domain: namely, that <em>NYPD Blue</em>‘s language was stylized, whereas <em>Deadwood</em>‘s
is literary.&nbsp; To that end, I present—below the fold, as this is a
family blog—the line of dialogue we discussed before Ogged’s latest
post:</p>
		</div>
					<a id="more"></a>
			<div class="entry-more">
				<blockquote><p><strong>Ellsworth</strong>: I’ll tell you what: I may have fucked
my life up flatter than hammered shit, but I stand here before you
today beholden to no human cocksucker.</p></blockquote>

<p>
Why does that sentence work?&nbsp; My best guess:
</p>
<p>
The “I’ll tell you what” is conventional enough.&nbsp; Only, which
convention does it partake of here?&nbsp; Is it the quiet, conspiratorial
“I’ll tell you what” salesmen whisper when they want to do us a favor
and throw in the top coat for an extra $400?&nbsp; (They’ll have to run it
by their manager.) If it is, the “tell” and “what,” the speech and its
content, would be emphasized; the “I” and “you” would sink, unstressed,
in order to abnegate responsibility for the fucking “I’m” about to do
to “you.” That doesn’t seem to work. </p>
<p>
So, how about the one in which the stresses fall drunkenly on the first and third beats?&nbsp; “<em>I’ll</em> tell <em>you</em>
what” embraces the responsibility for the beating “I” declare, for all
to hear, that “I’m” gonna put on “you.” This works much, much better.&nbsp; Such statements should, by law or enforced custom, incite terrible violence ... only this one doesn’t.
</p>
<p>Instead, we’re treated to a somber but forceful self-introspection.&nbsp; Ellsworth, we learn, “fucked [his] life up flatter than
hammered shit.” Look at mess of alliteration and assonance there.&nbsp; We
have the <em>f</em>
sounds stumbling in and out of “fucked,” “life” and “flatter.” Notice
how the poetic trickery staples the phrase together.&nbsp; The <em>fə</em> occurs in “fucked” and draws “life” and “up” together, almost into a single word (<em>li-fəp</em>), uniting life up with that what’s been fucked.&nbsp; You know, life.
</p>
<p>
The third <em>f</em> introduces the next sound, what linguists call the “near-open, front unrounded&quot;) <em>æ</em> which occurs in the word which best describes it: “flat.”&nbsp; The <em>flæ</em> pulls together the alliterative <em>f</em>s with the assonant <em>æ</em>s.&nbsp; (It also flips the <em>l</em> and <em>f</em> sounds of “life up,” a mirroring which’ll manifest thematically half a second later.)&nbsp; The repetition of the internal <em>æ</em> does what it describes: <em>it hammers</em>.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The <em>æ</em>, <em>æ</em>, <em>æ</em> drives home the content of the
phrase, too.&nbsp; He may have “fucked up [his] life,” but he did so
methodically and with force, rendering it “flatter than hammered” ...
and at this point we expect something worthy of the assonant pounding
it just took.&nbsp; I’m not sure why we do, since the phrase itself is
difficult to imagine: how do you fuck up something flat?&nbsp; Begs the
question:
</p>
<p>
How do you fuck it up <em>flatter</em>?
</p>
<p>The image we have at this point in the sentence is one of drunk
declaration; of the man who makes it, we sense that he’s ruined his
life through long effort, through the labor evoked by the mention and
soundscape of hammering.&nbsp; So we expect the object on the anvil, so to
speak, will be worthy of the beating it’s taking.&nbsp; Something
substantial, you know, dull-red and ready for a vicious forging.
</p>
<p>Instead, we get “shit.” That’s been “hammered” flat, no less. 
Suddenly, the entire sentence turns on its head.&nbsp; The rugged worker,
ruined by his steady toil, turns out to have been hammering <em>shit</em>.&nbsp; Those forceful <em>æ</em>s suddely sound as tinny as the <em>i</em> in shit.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
It’s pound, pound. pound, clank.&nbsp; Thud, thud, thud, tick.&nbsp; Our brains
skip a beat.&nbsp; In short, our impression of Ellsworth changes from proud
prospector to tedious slattern in the space of a sentence.
</p>
<p>When he realizes his mistake, he pulls back and changes course. 
“But,” he says, and mouths another, equally conventional, opening
statement.&nbsp; Unlike the threating “I’ll tell you what,” however, “I
stand before you today” belongs to the rhetoric of the public
confessional.&nbsp; No one stands before anyone, today or any other day,
unless they’ve come to repent (or pretend to).&nbsp; Realizing the bluster
of “I’ll tell you what” has come to naught, he decides to fluff his
feathers Protestant-style with a declaration of sins past. </p>
<p>
As with all such declarations, this one suggests the current superiority of the speaker to his audience.&nbsp; Do <em>they</em>
stand before the crowd, listing their iniquities for strangers to
judge?&nbsp; No, they don’t.&nbsp; They stand there, comfortable, quiet in their
sin.&nbsp; But the speaker, in high Protestant-style, aims to clear his
name.&nbsp; <em>In public</em>.&nbsp; He is no Catholic, absolved in isolation.&nbsp; He has a <em>direct</em> relation to God and a <em>firm</em> commitment to the community.&nbsp; Just like Milton.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Who, incidentally, Ellsworth suddenly channels: “I stand before you today <em>beholden to no human cocksucker</em>.”
The unnecessary and archaic “beholden” thrusts Milton in your mind, as
does the pejoratively adjectival “human.” This “human” reeks of “mere.”
God will judge him, it suggests, not some <em>human</em> authority. 
Given the implicit insult of “human,” then, we expect something
exalted, like “authorty,” to follow.&nbsp; Instead, we’re treated to
“cocksucker.” </p>
<p>
The dissonance is jarring.&nbsp; We may not think it consciously, but
somewhere, our brains know “cocksucker” ain’t sufficiently exalted to
be diminished so.&nbsp; We wonder what, exactly, is lower than a “<em>human</em>
cocksucker.” We imagine the angelic host on its knees, The Great Chain
of Being collapsing before our eyes.&nbsp; Links collide with unlike links
and ungodly things starting slouching, waiting to be born ... </p>
<p>
... and then we realize: <em>This</em>, kids, <em>is literature</em>.*
</p>
<p>
* And that Scott has far, far too much time on his hands.

		<span id="comment-21406645-content"><p>Nicely done, Scott. I do think that the effect could be encapsulated as going high with the low, or low with the high. But you grind it down here nicely. </p>

<p>Trixie bearing her breasts and eventually what Leopold Bloom would call her &quot;all&quot; (Nausicaa) was something, eh? Iconic. Long history of that, and Milch deployed it brilliantly. As well as Wu&#39;s <i>hang dai</i> moment with &quot;Swingen.&quot; </p>

<p>I do think that Sean&#39;s right to call attention to the politics in play, however. Coalition of the willing vs. the outlying hypercapitalist, who nonetheless can&#39;t stop regretting that he&#39;s waging war on his own. Sort of Eliot Spitzerism writ large.... </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the hooples are going to rise, alas. </p>

<p>But then there&#39;s the disability front, with the guy who works for Farnum, as well as, god, what&#39;s her name, the one who works for Swearingen. Fantastic when everyone has to slowly follow her up the stairs this episode. (My mother&#39;s got rather advanced MS - I&#39;ve followed slowly upstairs lots in my time...) </p>

<p>Anyway, can&#39;t believe they&#39;ve canned this show. Bright side: the Wire starts soonish. Which might just be the best they&#39;ve ever done, HBO. And plus, for us academic types, this season&#39;s focus (after having done drugs, unions, real estate) is on education. </p></span>

<blockquote>I do think that the effect could be encapsulated as going high with the low, or low with the high.</blockquote>

<p>Well, <a href="http://www.unfogged.com/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/unfogged/managed-mt/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=5333#392889" rel="nofollow">I&#39;d already done that</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The thing about the language of Deadwood is that it&#39;s too high to represent the miners&#39; argot but way, way too low to be Shakespeare or Milton. So the Shakespearean or Miltonian reaches are exactly that, an attempt to uplift, rhetorically, the sordid deeds they do. The show lays bear, breaks down the violence that Shakespearean diction masks by virtue of being, well, Shakespearean.</blockquote>

<p>The thing is, I&#39;m increasingly cognizant of the fact that I say things, run on hunches, but rarely take the time to do the work.  I know I&#39;m right—at least, I think I know I am—but no one ever makes me show my work.  (Outside of the dissertation, that is.)  Another way to say this is that I&#39;m increasingly skeptical of my snap judgments on matters not related to my dissertation.  So much so that I wonder whether, if I&#39;m forced to show my work, I can produce.  So I&#39;m working through my anxieties ... in public ... about television shows.  </p>

<blockquote>But then there&#39;s the disability front, with the guy who works for Farnum, as well as, god, what&#39;s her name, the one who works for Swearingen. Fantastic when everyone has to slowly follow her up the stairs this episode. (My mother&#39;s got rather advanced MS - I&#39;ve followed slowly upstairs lots in my time...)</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re thinking of Jewel.  Her relationship to Swearengen is ... interesting, especially considering the typical treatment not only of the disabled, but of disabled Civil War vets at the time.  </p>

<blockquote>Bright side: the Wire starts soonish.</blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t started this one yet.  I&#39;m a tremendous David Simon fan, I just haven&#39;t been in the mood for it.  What do I mean?  Well, last night I watched the first half of Spike Lee&#39;s <i>When the Levees Broke</i>.  My response?</p>

<blockquote>Am I the only one who didn&#39;t know THAT THE ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE made it there before FEMA or the National Guard?  Jesus Christ, the MOUNTIES!  THE MOUNTIES!</blockquote>

<p>Add in the sound of feet-stomping, hair-tearing, arm-waving and muffled screaming, and you&#39;ll see why I&#39;m not quite ready to watch <i>The Wire</i> yet.  Until this administration abdicates the throne, I&#39;m on a strict outrage-management diet ...</p>

<blockquote>Anyway, can&#39;t believe they&#39;ve canned this show.</blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t started watching the third season yet, but I don&#39;t know it isn&#39;t better to end it unnaturally.  First, that&#39;s just poetic.  Second—to circle back to what we talked about the other day—it leaves it a work of utopian literature, something Jameson would of approve of, at least.  It&#39;s historical, but lacks the teleology of history.  The hooples aren&#39;t going to rise, no; but neither have they been put beneath the boot.  I mean, I&#39;m pretty sure most of us know what happens to Deadwood.  There&#39;s a natural end to this story—one I hesitate to tell, lest any of y&#39;all don&#39;t know it—and it transforms the show into a tragedy, simplifying the themes Sean discusses into familiar, palatable palaver.  I&#39;m not sure it isn&#39;t better &quot;ending&quot; with a sudden, unexpected sto</p></span>

		<span id="comment-21424111-content"><p>I need this analysis to go further.  It&#39;s my impression that the language becomes more self-consciously Shakespearean in the second season, that there are more solilquies carried out in iambic pentameter.  I&#39;d like to know whether you can discern what the regulations are for use of iambic pentamenter, when Milch&#39;s characters use it and when they don&#39;t, and why, and how does this compare to Shakespeare.</p>

		<span id="comment-21425597-content"><p>It&#39;s mostly Swearengen who gets the full-on ip sounding soliloquies. And generally at moments of heightened intensity during season 2 (yes, you&#39;re right - Milch amps it up in the second season). Very few other characters get this treatment. Bullock certainly doesn&#39;t - he never says enough to put lines together so that you might hear it. </p>

<p>I actually think Milch has gone a bit far with Swearengen&#39;s discourse this season. He rarely speaks except in soliloquy. It&#39;s like Dan will ask him what to do next, and he&#39;ll rip off a 20 liner... Whereas in the second season, it was reserved as I said above, for moments of heightened intensity, self-reflection, rhetorical self-presentation, etc.</p>

<p>I guess Farnum gets a couple, now and then. But Hearst speaks prose, as does Bullock, as do the hooples and hos and sundry mechanicals. </p></span>

<p>slolernr, I don&#39;t do requests.  I mean, sure, I do them ... but I can&#39;t let anybody know that, or then I&#39;ll have to do them.  Still, I feel drained of all I have to say about <i>Deadwood</i>&#39;s prose for now.  But since I&#39;ll be re-watching the second season before I watch the third, there&#39;s a good possibility I&#39;ll follow up on this line of thought.  (Esp. now that it&#39;s been started.  Damn it, this means I&#39;ll have to take notes while watching it.  I don&#39;t mind, but you can imagine what The Little Womedievalist thinks.)</p>

<p>Also, I dig the fact that I&#39;ve gotten comments from Roger Mexico and slolernr in the past 24 hours.</p></span>

<p>Bullock in fact scarcely speaks at all after a while.  I think in the last episode but one he had one line.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s more ip than just Swearengen and E.B., but this reflects nothing more rigorous than occasional counting syllables on my fingers while watching. (I can&#39;t bring myself to take notes either.  But someone should.)</p></span>

<p>I have some catching up to do before I lay my two cents on the table. </p>

<p>I will say that I too think there is more ip than Swearengen and EB, I&#39;m currently re-watching seasons one and two, and since I&#39;m not teaching this semester I can indulge my pop culture geek side and start taking notes (If I disappear, it&#39;s because my girlfriend finally decided to put me out of my misery). </p>

<p>And The Wire. Well, needless to say I&#39;m also watching all the previous seasons in preperation for the new season. God I love that show. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-63548440-content"><p>Been watching Deadwood recently. Absolutely love it. Made me think of writing a book about this golden age of TV we&#39;re in at the moment, from HBO - Six Feet Under, Sopranos, The Wire, Deadwood. i think six foot might be better than deadwood in terms of emotional range, but Deadwood is fascinating from the point of view of the civilizing process, if anyone&#39;s read that, how society develops through the development of new technology and the spread of capital, and how this creates pacified places, increasing demands of civility and behaviour, increasing hypocrisy. think of the civilizing of calamity jane in season 2, for example. or how trixie gradually makes herself swear less in front of alma garrett. at the same time, there are wild forces within us which push against this encroaching civility and want to break out. you could see the killing of william by the wild horse as an example of this - the riding of the bicycle as a symbol of progress and civility, then the escaped horse as a symbol of the forces of chaos fighting back. </p></span>

Ellsworth got there sometimes, Farnum did it often but ONLY as a way to parrot Al (which is why it&#39;s hackneyed, cheap, cliche, melodramatic, and silly). Charlie Utter would get into it if he had a long enough line. Cy Tolliver as well, once or twice, really chewed on it. God remember how his words danced around that scene with the two kids who were conning him? Trixie. Langrishe. Merrick. The Reverend who died who&#39;s name I&#39;m regrettably forgetting. Maybe Bill. Like Shakespeare, they assigned the potential to break into iamb to characters as to reflect their nature. Poets, thinkers, philosophers, spiritualists, whatever. Those who are stuck with prose are the straight-minded go-getters who are the ones permeating the place with civilization&#39;s brand of normality. Hearst, Bullock, Alma, Cochran, Wolcott, Jane. Although Jane got poetic and slipped into verse when she&#39;d get to cursing.</p></span>

Now, as I was saying: Despite the dangers associated with taking over-the-counter medication when no symptoms present, you walk into the kitchen and drink a capful of green liquid which promises freedom from the sniffling, sneezing, coughing, aching, stuffy head, fever you don't have. So you can rest. Medicine. However, it succeeds only in making you extremely drowsy. &gt; wake up I thought you wanted to go to sleep. &gt; go to bed You watch two more episodes of House and are impressed by the frequency of improbable events which occur in the Princteon-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital.

As noted earlier, my initial response—sent to a non-academic listserv full of sharp, predominantly libertarian computer programmers—included the following paragraph: Am I the only one who didn't know that THE ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE made it [to New Orleans] before FEMA or the National Guard? Jesus Christ, the MOUNTIES! THE MOUNTIES! I didn't mean to disparage the Mounties, only point out that if they could saddle up and thunder to New Orleans in two days, surely someone in FEMA had access to transportation capable of outpacing moose. A damning condemnation, indeed. In that same message—keeping in mind the audience I addressed—I noted how despite being a propagandist ... [Lee] did an amazing job showing who, exactly, was affected by Katrina. Not just black people, but poor people. Infirm people. Elderly people. All abandoned. I'll return to why I called him a &quot;propagandist&quot; momentarily; for now, I want to share the first response to my message. Written by a stranger, someone new to the listserv, it said: I love your opening. I know he's a full of crap but this time I believe him because I don't like the President either. Note that I did not say Lee &quot;was full of crap,&quot; only that he was a &quot;propagandist.&quot; I couched Lee's aesthetic in such strong terms because, on a listserv populated by libertarians who clawed their way from desperate poverty to upper-middle prosperity, you find people convinced of the universal explanatory power of their personal Horatio Alger narratives. If I can make it, anyone can, they think. These narratives, however, are no more representative than Alger's were; but they lead those who possess them to assume that if someone fails to &quot;make it,&quot; that person didn't work hard enough, or with enough dedication, or secretly wanted to fail. Whatever the reasoning, the outcome is the same: They didn't make it because they didn't deserve to. After all, if I can make it, anyone can. Those who believe this would, thus, consider Spike Lee a propagandist, somewho attempted to elevate the social status of the undeserving. Racism exists, certainly, but can be overcome by exceptional individuals willing to invest the time and effort required to do so. To forestall this response, I noted the even-handedness of Lee's portrayal: not only did it depict the plight of the African-Americans stranded in New Orleans, but also that of everyone who couldn't afford, for medical or monetary reasons, to leave. Consider the rhetorical power of the statement I made: despite Lee being a known propagandist disinclined to think anyone with white skin a victim, the skeptical viewer can tease from his narrative of Katrina's aftermath a complete picture of the devestation that affected all its residents. Clever, ain't it? Unfortunately, one member of the audience turned out not to be that clever. First, as quoted above, he accused me of finding the documentary compelling because, like Lee, I...</span></a></div>
