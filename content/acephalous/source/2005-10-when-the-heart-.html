			<p>The responses to my initial offering cloud (through no fault but my own) the issue more than I'd already managed to: <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/on_evaluative_c.html#comment-10407960">Rich</a> reaches for the universal, <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/on_evaluative_c.html#comment-10408976">Luther</a> points to the particular and <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/on_evaluative_c.html#comment-10408518">Stephen</a> goes Goebbels.&nbsp; To my tired eyes, I think the strongest account mashes their three incommensurable ones into a single incoherent whole: the particular qualities of a literary text woo the reader into thinking in familiar enough terms while simultaneously challenging those same terms which render them communicable.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Here Luther's &quot;stupid rhetorical question&quot; becomes critical: if the critic wants to mirror the sciences, then a work like the <em>Wake </em>interests as a technical achievement made possible by contingent circumstances at a particular historical moment in a particular neurobiological environment; if the critic wants to parrot the arts, then a work like the <em>Wake </em>becomes an occasion to produce criticism in the style of the <em>Wake</em> (or at the very least informed by it).&nbsp; I think this dilemma has horns too wide for human arms.&nbsp; To grab one requires the other be released.&nbsp; This decision seems unreasonable because literary scholars imagine, by professional proxy if not personally, that the line between the two exists for one reason and one reason only: for people like literary scholars to toe.&nbsp; </p>



<p>What we need then is a governing system we all feel free to violate the moment its restraints chafe more than usual.&nbsp; But we need the system and the restraints and the chafing for the show to whiz-bang.&nbsp; Now keep in mind that I'm ignoring the entire history of aesthetics here so that I might build, from the ground up, my own theory of literary value based on chafing.&nbsp; &quot;Arms run red with strawberries are the ideal product of the aesthetic encounter,&quot; I want to be able to declare definitively.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But I cannot.&nbsp; I fear that if I focus much longer on this topic I'll feel compelled to enter a complicated discussion begun centuries before my birth and not nearly concluded yet, <em>i.e. </em>I'll have to read many pages of books which have little to do with my dissertation.&nbsp; But I'd rather invent my own system (predicated on refined chafing) and this is <em>not </em>because I&nbsp; spent the last few weeks' worth of witching hours reading George Eliot.&nbsp; Eliot demonstrates that didacticism can live happily within a novel whose worldview denies its cramped validity: the telepath whose actions signal he places more faith in phrenology than telepathy can barely navigate a world in which he knows what everyone thinks but cannot decide whether he knows who they are—as in <em>The Lifted Veil</em>—symbolizes my dilemma:</p>

<p>I know &quot;the literary&quot; when I hear it talking in my head, but I don't feel comfortable defining it until I can get my hands on its head and &quot;read&quot; it in accordance with the strictures of my pseudo-science.&nbsp; I am espousing rigor without method here, in case you're wondering, because I believe myself capable of no better at this moment.&nbsp; But&nbsp; at least I share my fears of inadequacy with George Eliot.</p>

		<span id="comment-10438833-content"><p>I can&#39;t remember the name of it now, but there&#39;s a complicated procedure from mathematics or one of the sciences or perhaps philosophy that I think that literary studies needs for the purpose of evaluative criticism.  The procedure goes: you start by exploring the range of likely theories, you determine that for practical purposes it doesn&#39;t really matter which one you hold, and you use this as a reason to be able to go ahead without trying to test which one is really true.  In a sense, that&#39;s what I was trying to do with my story about the scientists and the elephantiasis, to point out that under a wide range of possible explanations, you really should be able to make evaluative judgements with some confidence that other people will find them meaningful.  Even if you don&#39;t really understand how this happens.  So it really may not matter whether the science is pseudo or not.</p>

<p>These kind of theories also suggest that while art itself &quot;dispenses with the need for the creative work to refer in any empirical sense to the world&quot;, evaluative criticism does not; it implicitly consists of statements about people, not statements about art.  When you say that someone has written a great new work, what you mean is that person has found a new way to appeal to some human potentiality (whether biological or sociological or cultural doesn&#39;t really matter).</p>

<p>The reason I&#39;ve thought about this to this extent is that I find it rather odd that literary studies is so clueless about whether it can evaluate, having been so focused on evaluation previously.  That&#39;s an unusual progression in a field of knowledge; the closest historical comparision I can think of is a certain stage in the development of medicine, in which doctors discovered that their old remedies really didn&#39;t work before they discovered any that did.  A generation of doctors were taught that all they really had was bedside manner and a few simple things.  And of course part of the bedside manner was not telling non-doctors that nothing they had would work.  It seems like a good comparison.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-10497890-content"><p>An interesting or at least creepy thing happens as the scrupulously imaginative fiction writer more and more closely observes the inner states of their carefully particularized characters: the characters become universals.</p>

<p>Similarly, a critic who tries to carefully describe a work turns out to produce something oddly similar to that produced by a critic who tries to carefully describe the effect of a work: that is, something worthless as a consumer guide but which some of us still find worthwhile.</p>

<p>In both cases, what we notice, and therefore what we carefully note, swamps anything as thin as reader identification or a buying decision. The task of love swamps any question of liking.</p>

<p>Back when I used to write things that were published as reviews, editors would receive complaints that subscribers couldn&#39;t tell if I was recommending the work or not. Such a weird idea, though. Like waiting for someone to recommend the next breath. Or saying &quot;You simply *must* sleep with my spouse!&quot;<br />

		<span id="comment-10498691-content"><p>Well, there are a couple of ways to make those judgments, Rich.</p>

<p>One way is that the failure or triviality is blatant and dull. In which case, if I had been capable of noticing said failure or triviality, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to carefully study or describe the text because I&#39;m an undisciplined lazy bastard.</p>

<p>Another way is that the failure seemed to hit at something essential or amusing or at least interesting enough to keep me involved, or that it turned out that triviality isn&#39;t such a horrible sin in the grand scheme of heat death / implosion / Last Days / proletariat dictatorship / End of History things. In which case, &quot;failure&quot; or &quot;triviality&quot; aside, I would probably end up &quot;recommending&quot; the text. My own failures and trivialities should be so good.</p>

<p>Sometimes -- rarely, these days -- the main thing I want to say is that I&#39;m angry, but that&#39;s more likely to be anger about modish interpretations of texts than about texts themselves. Some of my most satisfying movie pans were of movies I didn&#39;t see.<br />

<p>Interesting.  With me I&#39;m generally motivated to do this when I&#39;m reading a bad book by an author who I usually like very much.  </p>

<p>But I think that the larger issue is that there are evaluative categories that go beyond &quot;good&quot; or &quot;not good&quot;.  You can form the judgement that something is an entertaining failure and, if your only purpose is to produce a recommendation, recommend that people read it only if they&#39;ve already read other specified books in its sub-genre that are not failures.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/on_evaluative_c.html"><span><strong>On Evaluative Criticism, Part the First of an Interminable Series; or, Emetic Prose and the People Who Emit It</strong> In the seminar room, graduate students set aside their typical standards of literary dress and don the scholarly robes they're expected to wear. They leave whatever criteria compels them to purchase books for reasons of pure enjoyment outside the seminar room when they enter it. Why? Because evaluative criticism has no place in contemporary scholarship. In my second entry on Pinter's Nobel selection, I complained that &quot;if [the selection committee has] been influenced by his recent poetry then they've compromised their standards and have degraded the legacies of previous award winners.&quot; My reasoning behind this statement is fairly simple and straightforward: his politically convenient poetry barely qualifies as poetry. It's heartfelt, yes, but so is the work of the fifteen year old &quot;playwright&quot; who penned this dialogue: So many changes happening at once. I don't see how we survived it. Turn on the television and what do you see? Massacre and slander coming from the next generation. The point, if you want the point of it. Well, I don't have one. That's the problem, I find the strangest little paradoxes of life, but no useful meaning of or for them. Comma splice? Check. Wildly inappropriate conjunctive phrase? Check. Super-sincerely felt emotion expressed via a pompous faux-philosophical soliloquy? Check. It contains all the familiar elements of a life and its concerns vomited on the page. The &quot;poetry&quot; Pinter's produced since he announced his retirement has that familiar emetic feel. So one answer to Rich's complaint—that &quot;contemporary literary studies is so far away from considering issues of quality that [there are not] any grounds for complaint that the Nobel choosing process is political&quot;—would be that poetry which excites vomition should not be rewarded with a Nobel Prize. Why does it does it have that effect? Sheer dreadfulness. The rhyme scheme? Terrible. The rhythm? Uninterestingly inconsistent. The propagandistic intent? Brazenly transparent. Combine aesthetic inaudicity with patent proselytical intent and what you have resembles neither art nor skillful propaganda so much as an adolescent discharge of undigested emotion. Does this constitute evaluative criticism? It certainly does. I find it interesting that the ear for language Pinter possessed in the '50s and '60s has turned tin since his retirement. I had always considered that particular skill permanently acquired. Pinter proved me wrong. Whatever it is about his political commitments that has caused his ear such atrophy interests me intellectually, but it doesn't validate his latter-day ejecta aesthetically. It gives them the gravitas due all talent squandered, but it doesn't compel me to read a whit more than I absolutely have to. All of which is only to say that I can't identity the antecedent of &quot;it&quot; in the previous sentences, and that the more I attempt to the more tangled my thought becomes. I do not believe, as some suggest, that any account of my reaction would necessarily constitute an ex post facto justification for whatever gut reaction I've had. There's a reason my gut reacts as surely as there's one my knee sometimes jerks....</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/the_stamp_of_a_.html"><span><strong>The Stamp of a Morbid Organization; or, Don't Read It!</strong> Many titles of entries written during the First Annual Acephalous George Eliot-a-Thon will be written by George Eliot. That said: the entry previous to this one should not have been published. I don't have the heart to delete it yet. It stewed (if intermittently) on the back-burner all day and I ought to at least let it have its moment on the table. It wants to be consumed. But like any good cook, I know better than to let the food I prepare adjudicate its quality. It is an unfit judge—kith if not kin, I venture, to the undergraduate essay which pleads for the superior mark its author almost desired enough to put forth what those in the rest of the world call &quot;effort&quot; in order to acquire it. So I put the previous post on the table with a disappointed scowl. I encourage you to place your adventurousness back in the pocket from whence it came and save it for something more exotic. I'll plate some Porteguese-Moroccan Fusion for you next week, I promise. Just please, let that poor post die its quiet death. (Were my delirium not itself delirious I would now segue into my now well-rehearsed schpiel about the importance of habitual writing. But as it is and I doubly so, I'll refrain.)</span></a></div>
