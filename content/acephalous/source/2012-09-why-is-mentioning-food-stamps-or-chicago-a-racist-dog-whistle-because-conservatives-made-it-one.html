			<p>Conservatives have a problem with history. It&#39;s not just that their 
preferred rhetorical appeals harken back to a Golden Age that only 
existed on the television shows they watched while their mothers or 
their maids slaved away in the kitchen—though that&#39;s clearly 
problematic—nor is it just that they rely on a cursory examination of 
ill-worded search results to construct their devastating critiques of 
the evils of everything to their left <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/theres-pathetic-and-then-there-is-this">to hilarious effect</a>.
 So it&#39;s not just that their fake history is a projected concoction or 
that their understanding of actual history is wanting that I take issue 
with: it&#39;s that their understanding of their own history is facile they 
can&#39;t tell the forest from the seas.</p>
<p>Case in point: <a href="http://patterico.com/2012/08/31/if-you-oppose-obama-you-are-a-racist/">the</a> <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/rusty-weiss/2012/08/30/chris-matthews-and-msnbc-now-claim-word-chicago-racist">oblivious</a> <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2012/08/30/newest-racist-dog-whistle-chicago/">guffawing</a>
 about &quot;food stamps&quot; or &quot;Chicago&quot; being metonyms for racism in 
conservative circles. That this seems as obvious a gambit to liberals as
 mentioning <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/11/black-people-cant-swim-c.html">black people and swimming pools</a> is beside the point: they&#39;re crying &quot;No foul!&quot; so it needs doing. (<em>Sigh</em>.)
 To establish the metonymic &quot;credentials&quot; of &quot;Chicago&quot; I could go back 
to the anti-labor sentiment that prevailed during the time of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair">Haymarket Riot</a>
 or the anti-immigrant sentiment that prevailed two decades later or the
 anti-machine politics sentiment that prevailed during the reign of 
Daley the First or the anti-left and anti-anti-war sentiment that 
prevailed during and after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Democratic_National_Convention">the 1968 Democratic National Convention</a>
 but I won&#39;t. To do any more then note in passing that Chicago&#39;s always 
functioned as a convenient punching bag for conservatives would a waste 
of time.</p>
<p>Because there&#39;s a particular moment in the history of conservative 
metonymy that bears mentioning in the light of the &quot;unbelievable&quot; or 
&quot;outrageous&quot; claim that associating President Obama with &quot;food stamps&quot; 
or &quot;Chicago&quot; might constitute a &quot;subtle&quot; form of racism supposedly only 
detectable by liberals. But before we get there we need to perform a 
simple Google search for &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=100l&amp;q=%22food+stamp+president%22&amp;oq=%22food+stamp+president%22">food stamp president</a>&quot; and <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/01/newt-gingrich">quick</a> <a href="http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2012/06/the-food-stamp-president-2.php">scan</a> <a href="http://spectator.org/blog/2012/09/04/the-most-successful-food-stamp">of the</a> <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-01-25/gingrich-calling-obama-food-stamp-president-draws-critics.html">results</a>. Conservatives are clearly trying to create an association between President Obama and food stamps. It doesn&#39;t matter that <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/ora/MENU/Published/snap/FILES/Participation/2010Characteristics.pdf">the majority of food stamp recipients are white</a>
 because conservatives aren&#39;t building a factual argument—they&#39;re making
 a rhetorical appeal. The very fact that movement conservatives embraced
 the image of President Food Stamps indicates the success of the appeal.
 Why would liberals claim that there&#39;s a racial component to that 
appeal? Is it, as conservatives argue, simply because the President is 
half-black and any policy or entitlement linked to him is speciously 
yoked to his color?</p>
<p>Of course not. Only a person pig-ignorant of recent history would make such a claim. So here&#39;s where we stand:</p>
<ol>
<li>The President hails from Chicago&#39;s South Side.</li>
<li>Conservatives have successfully branded Obama President Food Stamps.</li>
</ol>
<p>Where&#39;s the racism? How about we ask the Most Blessed Saint of the 
Modern Republican Party, Ronald Reagan, who said the following of a 
woman from the South Side of Chicago during the 1976 campaign:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She has eighty names, thirty addresses, twelve Social 
Security cards  and is collecting veteran’s benefits on four 
non-existing deceased  husbands. And she is collecting Social Security 
on her cards. She’s got  Medicaid, getting food stamps, and she is 
collecting welfare under each  of her names. Her tax-free cash income is
 over $150,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only did Saint Ronald invent the myth of the &quot;welfare queen&quot; with
 this remark, by doing so through the image of a woman from the South 
Side of Chicago he explicitly made it a racial issue <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Side,_Chicago#Demographics">because the South Side is 95 percent African-American</a></em>.
 I grant that Saint Ronald could&#39;ve done everyone a favor and summoned 
this mythical woman from the dark depths of a Harlem or a Compton or any
 other area that even the most ignorant contemporary conservative knows 
is overbrimming with black folk. But he didn&#39;t. He chose the South Side,
 which in 1976 still brought to mind images of noted rabble-rouser 
Martin Luther King, Jr. <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-chicagodays-martinlutherking-story,0,4515753.story">marching in support of public housing</a>. To whose minds were and are those images brought? The largest block of voters in the Republican Party: <em><a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/socdemo/voting/publications/p20/2008/tables.html">old white people</a></em>.</p>
<p>These old white people just happen to be the same who pine for the 
Golden Era when Saint Ronald ruled the land. When they claim that the 
linking President Obama to food stamps or Chicago isn&#39;t racially coded 
they&#39;re either age-addled or lying. They remember Saint Ronald and are 
still moved by references to his rhetorical appeals. That they deny 
knowledge of how the unadulterated appeals themselves worked points to 
either dementia or dishonesty. So let&#39;s add this up one more time for 
them:</p>
<ol>
<li>The President hails from Chicago&#39;s South Side.</li>
<li>Chicago&#39;s South Side is 95 percent African-American.</li>
<li>Saint Ronald linked the South Side to food stamps.</li>
<li>Conservatives have successfully branded Obama President Food Stamps.</li>
</ol>
<p>What do you get? I get a rhetorical situation in which conservatives 
can negatively signal Obama&#39;s blackness to their core constituency of 
old white people in two interrelated ways <em>that can both be directly traced back to Saint Ronald.</em>
 Meaning that not only is Obama&#39;s blackness connected to food stamps and
 Chicago via an established rhetorical appeal, that appeal bears the 
authorizing imprimatur of the Most Blessed Saint of the Republican 
Party. The only way contemporary conservatives can credibly claim that 
there&#39;s no racial component to mentioning Chicago or food stamps would 
be to disown Saint Ronald. But I don&#39;t see that happening anytime soon.</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31b03440970b-content"><p>What you have here is your basic enthymematic rhetoric, when someone <i>wants</i> the audience to link two concepts that otherwise aren&#39;t connected, but either doesn&#39;t have the evidence to support that case, or doesn&#39;t want to get caught &quot;mis-speaking.&quot; So those concepts are stated in proximity to each other without directly linking them, in the hopes that the audience will do the link-work. This establishes the dicey claim, and ostensibly leaves the speaker&#39;s hands clean.</p>

<p>Reagan already established the premise by outwardly linking &quot;South Side Chicago&quot; and &quot;food stamps&quot; with &quot;black&quot; (and a particular sort of black caricature). All someone has to do now is say Obama&#39;s name in the same sentence as &quot;South Side Chicago&quot; or &quot;food stamps,&quot; the dog whistle is sounded, and anyone who paid attention to Reagan will get the subtext. </p>

<p>It&#39;s nothing new -- its used in advertising all the time, and can be especially effective in film/television when combined with visual cues. But another recent and egregious use of enthymematic political rhetoric was when Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld would constantly remind people to think of our troops in Iraq when we think of 9/11, or vice-versa. Before long, the majority of the U.S. public believed Iraq had something to do with 9/11, despite all evidence and even the 9/11 Report flatly stating that wasn&#39;t the case.   </p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/09/theres-pathetic-and-then-there-is-this.html"><span><strong>There's pathetic and then there is this.</strong> Someone sent me a link to this and asked me to analyze it: What is this monstrosity? It’s a Chris Muir print signed by the following giants of the Blogosphere: Michelle Malkin, Glenn and Helen Reynolds (Instapundit and Dr.Helen), Bill Whittle (Afterburner), Jeff Goldstein (Protein Wisdom), Ed Morrissey (Hot Air), Robert Stacy McCain (The Other McCain), and Mandy Nagy (Liberty Chick). Where to begin the hilarity? If this is a play on &quot;The Last Supper&quot; why did Muir put Eric Holder in the Jesus-spot? Why didn't he put Obama in the Judas-spot? How about the self-aggrandizing placement of the folks around the table: Sarah Palin and President Obama are equals, as are Michelle Malkin and Nancy Pelosi. Jeff Goldstein's just as influential as someone who could be Chris Matthews. (It's difficult to tell because Muir can't use the cartoon filter in Photoshop any better than he can draw.) But we needn't even worry about where people are at the table because the real hubris is that they're there at all. The mind boggles. UPDATE: As noted in the comments, the poorly drawn Democrats (and John Roberts) are affiliated with the phrase “Exitus Acta Probat,” which can also be found here: That’d be the coat of arms of that most traitorous of Americans—George Washington.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/09/covering-the-convention-coverage.html"><span><strong>Covering the convention coverage</strong> The consensus on Clinton’s speech last night seems to fall between “world-historically awesome” and “the speech by which all future speech will be judged and found wanting.” I wouldn’t expect anything less from the best Republican President in recent memory. But what’s interesting to me isn’t the content of the speech—whatever it was I didn’t watch it—but the reaction of conservatives to a successful speech by a prominent Democrat. Consider who’s discussing the two most popular transcripts according to memeorandum: For your convenience I clicked on all of the possible links to conservative blogs or news organizations. Notice something? Either it’s taking them a very long time to devise an effective strategy to counter Clinton’s rhetoric or they’ve decided that refusing to write about it will make it go away. In their defense there’s a good chance they’re correct—not because they’ve chosen to ignore it but because conventions aren’t important anymore—but I can’t pass up the opportunity to note the wonderful irony of watching the party of Manly Men Who Make Money and War paralyzed into a panicked silence when confronted by the molehill they’ve mistaken for a mountain.</span></a></div>
