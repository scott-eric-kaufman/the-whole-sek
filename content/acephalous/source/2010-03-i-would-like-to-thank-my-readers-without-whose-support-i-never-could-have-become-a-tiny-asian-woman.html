Do you ever listen to NPR without being a member?  Come to that, do you ever change the radio or TV station when an ad comes on?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a922989b970b-content"><p>The difference, to my mind, is twofold. Firstly, that with Ars (and sites with a similar model) their advertising revenue is directly linked to how many times the ad is viewed, and that number is tracked by the company. Because of this, the difference between loading ads and blocking ads is a direct difference in how much money Ars gets. Secondly, the operating costs of a website - at least in terms of bandwidth - are tied to how often the site is accessed. So accessing the site costs Ars money, viewing the ads makes Ars money, if you do them together Ars stays afloat, if you do the first without the second Ars loses out.</p>

<p>Neither of these is the case with TV advertising, or broadcast radio*. It doesn&#39;t cost the TV or radio station any more when I tune in, and it doesn&#39;t make them any less if I skip the ads, because they can&#39;t detect either (since I&#39;m not in one of the samples from which TV ratings are worked out). So the two cases seem quite disparate to me.</p>

<p>*I&#39;m a UKer, so I&#39;m not sure how NPR works - I have little sympathy for people dodging the BBC licence fee, but since that&#39;s actually illegal it&#39;s probably not a good analogy.</p></span>

If you&#39;re fine with that, then you&#39;re fine with that - which is exactly what Ken Fisher was saying at Ars Technica:</p>

<p><i>I am not making an argument that blocking ads is a form of stealing, or is immoral, or unethical, or makes someone the son of the devil. It can result in people losing their jobs, it can result in less content on any given site, and it definitely can affect the quality of content.</i></p>

<p>Nobody&#39;s launching a moralistic attack on adblocking (which seems to be what you&#39;re trying to defend against) but a practical one. A hypothetical imperative, not a categorical one: if you want Ars Technica to flourish, you should support it.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a9276a08970b-content"><p>Ken&#39;s claim not to be making an ethical complaint was, I thought, extremely disingenuous.  Look at what you quoted: it&#39;s not unethical to do block ads, but doing so is the equivalent of getting someone fired who doesn&#39;t deserve it.  Or look at these other claims that follow this &quot;it&#39;s not an ethical issue&quot; protestation (emphases added):</p>

<p><i>If you read a site and care about its well being, then you <b>should not </b> block ads</p>

<p>I think it is <b>far better</b> to vote with page views than to show up and consume resources without giving anything in return.</p>

<p>I think in some ways the Internet and its vast anonymity feeds into a culture where many people do not think about the people, the families, the careers that go into producing a website.</p>

<p>my point still stands: if you like this site you <b>shouldn&#39;t</b> block ads.</p>

<p>blocking ads hurts the sites you love.</i></p>

<p>How are those not ethical claims?  It&#39;s not unethical to block ads, it just makes you a leech who does what he shouldn&#39;t do and hurts people who don&#39;t deserve it?  I would respect the piece a lot more without his incoherent insistence that he&#39;s not making an ethical claim.</p>

<p>Having said that, I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s wrong for a site like Ars to publish a request like this.  I would compare this issue to the question of credit cards.  Customers like using credit cards because they&#39;re convenient, plus sometimes we get rewards points for them.  However, merchants don&#39;t like credit cards because they have to pay a fee to the credit card companies, which cuts into profits.  So merchants have a choice: they can just suck it up, they can refuse to take credit cards, or they can (I suppose) put up a sign saying, &quot;Please consider paying with cash.&quot;  If a business  put up such a sign, I would consider complying, based on how much I supported them and how much of a bother it would be to pay with cash instead of card.  However, if I did decide to pay with a card, I wouldn&#39;t feel guilty—I&#39;m not breaking any rules, but simply choosing not to grant a favor.  If the business wanted, they could simply refuse to accept credit cards, so if they allow them they can&#39;t complain if I choose to use one.</p>

<p>Similarly, Ars has the option of blocking visitors using ad blockers (they did so for a time; that&#39;s the premise of the piece) or of going subscription-only.  Since they&#39;ve decided not to do that, I presume that they&#39;ve decided it&#39;s worth the loss of revenue to have more people reading and linking to their stuff.  If a site I visit regularly (for the record, I have never read Ars Technica except for the article under discussion) makes a similar request, I&#39;ll consider complying, but not with any sense of obligation.</p></span>

Advertisers know that ad viewing has declined (relative to TV viewing) as a direct result of TiVo and DVR, and that advertising time is less valuable as a result.  Why do you think TV executives initially complained that TiVoing was &quot;theft&quot;?  If you buy a TiVo or DVR, you&#39;re contributing to a decrease in revenue to the shows you love.</p>

<p>In fact, Ars Technica has an advantage that the broadcasters don&#39;t.  Ars Technica can block anyone who isn&#39;t contributing revenue—either by subscribing or by viewing ads—from getting the content.  The broadcasters can&#39;t.</p></span>

<p>Keep in mind, in your credit card comparison, it isn&#39;t that difficult to pay with cash at the small business, and then take out your card when you walk into Borders. Doesn&#39;t really work as easily when you&#39;re using adblockers (at least the one&#39;s I&#39;ve used).  </p></span>

For Palin!!</strong> For whatever reason, Google Reader’s “Explore” option recently started lumping all political sites together irrespective of orientation, which means that even time I try to find new, interesting voices, I’m bombarded with new, interesting-for-the-wrong-reason-but-potential-blog-fodder voices. For example: We believe the TV show [Sarah Palin]’s producing with Mark Burnett on the wonders of Alaska will be Reaganesque in its reach of regular people. For something written by “such good writers,” that sentence is uglier than it is stupid. The majority of Americans won’t appreciate a show about “the wonders of Alaska” for the simple reason that Americans only watch things about Alaska when its bears eat tourists. Don’t believe me? Consider Christopher Nolan’s career: Batman Begins: $205,343,774 Insomnia: $67,263,182 The Dark Knight: $533,316,061 When his films take place in Alaska, their domestic gross drops, on average, very large numbers because Americans don’t believe that states whose moose-caribou population density (1.11/sq. mi.) outstrips its population density (1.03/sq. mi.) count as America. The idea that a successful Palin campaign could be initiated by a show about 700,000 moose and caribou picked to live in a state and have their lives taped to find out what happens when they stop being polite and start getting real—there’s wishful thinking, then there’s whatever that is. This too: If [the show is] informative, well-produced, and showcases Palin’s Alaska, we believe it will become a cultural phenomenon. We foresee Alaskan imagery everywhere in 2011. Which is a wonderful setup for the Palin brand in 2012. Late 2010-early 2011 is also when Palin’s next book is due: a policy book on American Virtues. That will be coupled with a book tour that should end round about February 6th, 2011, the day we believe Palin will announce her presidential run. Essentially, the tour bus she uses for the book [American Virtues] will just be slightly rebranding as PALIN 2012, instead of American Virtues. Chances are, “American Virtues” will actually be her campaign motto. We can see the branding and marketing already at work. These people should not be mocked for claiming 1) that Palin will write a book by her lonesome, 2) that it will be policy-oriented, or 3) that people can write policy books about virtues: they should be pitied for the wistful tones in which they imagine the subtle repurposing of a tour bus in terms of branding, because people who daydream in ad lingo about campaign slogans are the saddest people in the world. Then there’s the fact that, on principle, dreamers this dumb deserve pity: Palin’s playing 11th dimensional chess that RedState’s not seeing, because it’s so focused on Romney, or dazzled by his Mattel-produced hair. She’s operating a fully-formed multimedia strategy designed to counter Dr. Utopia’s razzle dazzle and media darling status. Follow that RedState link and you’ll find a discussion of a post at the Daily Caller that warms my heart: [I]t is very important to point out that something like this may already be Palin’s plan (for the record, I have shared almost...</span></a></div>
