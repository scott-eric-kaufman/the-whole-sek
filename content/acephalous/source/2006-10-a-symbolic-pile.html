			<p>A summary of the third installment of <em>Some Unspeakably Wretched American Novel</em> (1900):

</p><blockquote><p>A woman with a beautiful face but a slightly deformed body asks a sculptor to &quot;realize&quot; the urn from Keats' poem so that she might put it in the &quot;wild garden&quot; she's devising.</p>

<p>

&quot;I thought if&nbsp; could see the vase I should understand how Keats felt when he wrote,&quot; she says.&nbsp; &quot;But now I feel that it must not stand in the garden.&nbsp; It must be alone somewhere in the wood.&quot;

</p>

<p>

Three friends of the pair then walk up, examine the vase and profess confusion:</p>

<p>

&quot;'Ode to a <em>Grecian</em> Urn,' that was?&quot; asks the scholar.</p>

<p>

&quot;The <em>Keats</em> poem?&quot; inquires the doctor.</p>

<p>

&quot;The 'Bold Lover'—is that <em>Lincoln</em>?&quot; bids his wife.</p>

<p>

It is.&nbsp; His beloved, the &quot;happy melodist,&quot; the &quot;mysterious priest&quot; and those who accompany him to the sacrifice—they're <em>all</em> Lincoln.&nbsp; 

One stands on a rock, bearing the President's &quot;strong, homely, humorous face, a look of loneliness in the eyes.&quot;&nbsp; Another has his &quot;hands clasped, palms down, thinking of his life, of his boyhood, of the past.&quot;</p>

<p>

Below the rock stands a &quot;long, ungainly figure of Lincoln, the boy, in a hunting-shirt, his hand resting on an ax-handle, one foot on a log, a serious figure, in the brief pause from labor, considering with quiet, lineless face the future, as above him the complete [men] regarded an heroic past.&quot;</p>

<p>

After assaying the sculptor's &quot;realization&quot; of Keats' poem, the scholar—who, at the moment, ismaking love to the sculptor's beautiful but lame patron—insults the &quot;broken-backed chair&quot; with &quot;one cracked leg strengthened with twine and a splint of wood&quot; performing the duty of a pedestal:</p>

<p>

&quot;Why did you put it on that hideous stool?&nbsp; It is very beautiful, but the chair spoils it.&nbsp; It is like putting a beautiful head on a distorted body.&quot;</p>

<p>

His beloved's beautiful head swivels on its distorted body and everyone—Lincolns included—hyperventilates in horror.</p></blockquote><p>

What happened here?&nbsp; So glad you asked:</p>

<p>

You see, the sculptor swerved to avoid a strangely familiar disabled lady toddling across the interstate, slammed <em>Ekphrasis</em>-first into a parked Keats, looked behind him, gasped at the fleet of Lincolns bearing down on him and jumped from his ride just as the Great Emancipators began pounding it one model year after another after another after another.</p>

<p>

His friends—who were following him but had been stranded by a red light the sculptor roared through—pull up, scream in disbelief, then follow a trail of blood across some well-manicured wilderness.&nbsp; They quickly find the sculptor and his shaken patron deep in conversation about this transitory life—which they compare, unfavorably, to aesthetic immortality of the type enshrined in poesy.&nbsp; Keats, Lincoln and how to keep Nature looking its most natural occupy the company until the scholar, crushing hard on his beloved, interrupts the gay proceedings with a thoughtless remark about the &quot;lame&quot; turn the conversation has taken, and everyone—dead Lincolns too—hyperventilates in horror.</p>

<p>All I can think of is Dick Lupoff, in an essay in the book _All In Color For a Dime_, writing about a 1940s comic book artist whose characters all looked like Randolph Scott: &quot;The hero is Randolph Scott.  The wise old scientist is a bewhiskered Randolph Scott.  The newsboy is young Randolph Scott.  The damsel in distress is Randolph Scott in drag.&quot;</p></span>

I've a file in which I store spam-text, so creating these poems consisted of finding just the right line to develop each to what I, in the spirit of the originals, will call its &quot;most maximal potential.&quot; I played by the rules this time—each line is rendered as it arrived in my inbox, with no change in tense or pronomial shifts—but in the future I may fiddle with the formula until &quot;I can deliver it superbly every time the way she likes it.&quot; For now, the rules are the rules &quot;even though most people don't know they exist yet.&quot; I think most of the lines will be recognized &quot;easily and instantly, without you having to do anything.&quot; I that think contributes to a charm &quot;which will certainly be increasing over time, especially in the next year.&quot; So yes, the &quot;poems&quot;: Mostly Urgent* The great prognosis is drawn up. The achievements of our highly capable partnership will exceed all expectations. The key is getting in early. We have a place for you. Can you confirm your interest in our mutual respect? We will remember your notification number. The transaction is without risk. You should not entertain any fear at all. There will be no stopping this one. Right now we wait for it triple. Increases are not down lately. We advise you to buy today. *Our target is a modular fish system. Race War The race war will come. You will likely be a winner. Chief John's Plan My name is Chief John. I have a very sensitive Plan which may interest you if You are not the man you once were. If you have ever wanted To reclaim the virile potency of your youth, Give my plan a thought and get back to me soon, As a demonstration of your interest In recapturing your masculinty With rapid short term growth. Bad Timing You can live a longer and fuller life unless The cause of death is suspicious. (By then it will be too late.) Real Men Hear Voices Imagine being able to have: Died in a boat accident when returning from a business trip— With your entire family in a tragic plane crash— From an unexpected cancer of the breast— At the hands of unpatriotic rebels— Or suddenly. You would surely take advantage of the opportunity To see your loved ones taken care of. But do not tell them them when you start communicating with them. (Except for the brother of the President: No one can scare a real alpha male.) We Aim to Articulate We seek history. We are casting our net widely. Spectacles and speculations frame us.

Someday soon I'll explain my sudden infatuation with Keats' &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn.&quot; In the meantime, feel free to hazard insulting guesses like: &quot;He's become a raving asthete!&quot; &quot;Literature finally went to his head!&quot; &quot;He ate pancakes!&quot; All kidding aside, the Keats research which turned up these oddities works nicely as the capstone to my current chapter. I can finish off Mitchell with his love of and slavish imitation to Keats, then move on to something new ...
