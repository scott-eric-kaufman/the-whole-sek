In this wilderness of leaves, which was as dense as the forests itself, a duck sat on her nest, hatching her ducklings. At last the eggshells began to crack. &quot;Peep, peep!&quot; said the little things, as all the ducklings but one poked out their heads. The duck looked at the intact egg. &quot;It takes a long time with that one egg,&quot; said the duck on the nest. &quot;It won't crack, but look at the others. They are the cutest little ducklings I've ever seen. They look exactly like their father, the wretch! He hasn't come to see me at all.&quot; The summer months passed. At last the big egg did crack. &quot;Peep,&quot; said the young one, and out he tumbled, but he was so big and ugly. The duck took a look at him. &quot;That's a frightfully big duckling,&quot; she said. &quot;He doesn't look the least like the others. Into the water he shall go, even if I have to shove him in myself.&quot; So off went the duckling. He swam on the water, and dived down in it, but still he was slighted by every living creature because of his ugliness. Autumn came on. The leaves in the forest turned yellow and brown. The wind took them and whirled them about. The heavens looked cold as the low clouds hung heavy with snow and hail. It made one shiver to think of it. Pity the poor little duckling! Then from the thicket before him came three lovely white swans. They ruffled their feathers and swam lightly in the stream. The duckling recognized these noble creatures, and a strange feeling of sadness came upon him. &quot;I shall fly near these royal birds, and they will peck me to bits because I, who am so very ugly, dare to go near them. But I don't care. Better be killed by them than to be nipped by the ducks, pecked by the hens, kicked about by the hen-yard girl, or suffer such misery in winter.&quot; So he flew into the water and swam toward the splendid swans. They saw him, and swept down upon him with their rustling feathers raised. &quot;Kill me!&quot; said the poor creature, and he bowed his head down over the water to wait for death. But what did he see there, mirrored in the clear stream? He beheld his own image, and it was no longer the reflection of a clumsy, dirty, gray bird, ugly and offensive. He himself was a swan! Being born in a duck yard does not matter, if only you are hatched from a swan's egg. Thus ennobled, he lit into the air with the elegance expected of his kind and drifted majestically until ... AMERICA! FUCK YEAH! MCDONALD'S! THE INTERNET! SLAVERY! FUCK YEAH! *Photos courtesy of Kelly Munday.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/06/sleep-is-for-th.html"><span><strong>&quot;Sleep is for the weak.&quot;</strong> So said my former roommate as he stumbled home at 5 a.m. three years back. An assistant to the regional manager of the fondue restaurant my friend ran fancied himself an American Gordon Ramsay, so he decided to spring a kitchen inspection fifteen minutes after closing. If you've ever worked in a restaurant—even one where the customers cook for themselves—you know what kitchens look like when service ends. Even the most conscientious chef clips what must be tackled tonight and finishes honest the next morning. But the assistant to the regional manager to whom my roommate reported had seen an episode of The F-Word and demanded the tiles in the employee bathroom be regrouted before the illegal immigrants his boss had hired under the table began chopping the raw vegetables customers would cook for themselves tomorrow night. &quot;Urine is bad enough,&quot; he seemed to be saying. &quot;But Mexican urine? For fuck sake, we employ white women here.&quot; And so the great cleaning commenced. My friend stumbled home high on Comet and Camels that night, but he didn't complain. The resignation in his eyes brought tears to mine, but he is a proud worker. Work means everything to him. When he tripped forward and folded like a lawn-chair across the arm of the couch, I placed a blanket over him and waited to make sure he could breathe while jack-knifed over furniture like a drunk yogi. The second his foghorns announced unconsciousness, I congratulated myself yet again for being awake so early and did something unmemorable for a few hours. I have no idea what I did that morning because I immediately fell asleep at the desk. However, I distinctly remember pretending to be fully awake as he peeled himself off the arm of the couch to greet me good morning. I muttered something about him getting in awful late last night. &quot;Sleep is for the weak,&quot; he replied. Apropos of absolutely nothing whatsoever, I want it on the record that I can't express in words how much I agree with said assessment about sleepers. If you've had more than three hours of sleep in the past four days, your flouncy constitution needs manly emboldening. Because sleep is for the weak. Don't believe me? Maybe these photos (NSFW) will convince you: And one final shot which, despite depicting nothing sleeping, oozes odious weakness: All photos via.</span></a></div>
