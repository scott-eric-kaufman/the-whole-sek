<p>You might remember that I&#39;m usually a conservative gadfly but your troubles this past week reminded me that there are other aspects of blogging life that create connections rather than irrational screaming. My own behavior on the &#39;Tubes hasn&#39;t always been civilized and I&#39;d like to continue to grow as a person first and commentator second.</p>

<p>BJTexs, thanks for the bipartisan support.  Laughter&#39;s universal, so long as it ain&#39;t political.  As for my official blog song, the more I think about it, the more I think it&#39;d have to be by Tom Waits.

Every technological advance has been accompanied by vehement complaints to the effect that &quot;the world has been let in.&quot; Television, you remember, was once an intrusion of the world rather than an escape from it. The telephone? Can't have those switchboard operators working the night through. What if some stranger rang at 3 a.m.? Those houses without hallways? Clearly a sign of &quot;the indifference to privacy which has sprung up in modern times.&quot; A house should be constructed as a series of suites, each connected to the main hallway by another hallway. Better yet, that second hallway shouldn't connect to the main, but to an antechamber branching off it, so as to assure &quot;greater privacy.&quot; You know, I've seen Edith Wharton's dream home. I'm quite sure I wouldn't want to live there.</span></a></div>

I try to avoid writing about my unintellectual passions here. They're mine, and passionate, but they're not why you read me. That said, since uniquely engaging prose stylings falls well within my ken of expertise, I feel justified in making the following recommendation: If you're at all interested in bÃ©isbol, read Joe Posnanski's blog. This recommendation falls into the same category as the one I'd offer in defense of A.J. Liebling's A Neutral Corner: the man can write. He can create and sustain interest in subjects you might not otherwise care about. This is the defining characteristic of literary journalism: orchids weren't my thing before Orlean, and although I had fond thoughts of my undergraduate work in geology, I never yearned to return to before McPhee. Posnanski possesses the same talent: read his column on Bo Jackson and tell me that you, bÃ©isbol fans, don't flash back. Non-bÃ©isbol fans, read it and tell me that some part of you doesn't want to know what it is us fans flash back to. Writing with impassioned humility, Posnanski's able to riff like this: Hal, in case you donât know, was a fabulous long-time sportswriter in Clevelandâhe co-wrote a book with Satchel Paige, to give you an ideaâbut he was probably best known for that Sporting News column where he would try to clear up absurd rules questions from readers. Dear Hal: My buddy and I were arguing. Letâs say a player had really, really long legsâor even that he had the sort of superpowers that would allow him to stretch his arms like rubberâand he could touch first base and second base at the same time. Would he be out if you tagged him at that precise moment that he was touching both bags? Is there a rule against touching two bases at once? My buddy says yes, but I think he would be safe. What do you say? Signed: Confused. And then Hal, would respond in some gentlemanly fashion: Dear Confused: Shut up. My favorite Hal-Lebovitz-type column, though, used to run in the Lake County News Herald in the 1990s. Iâve talked about this before, but I never get tired of it â¦ by that time Hal was pretty old and his mind tended to drift a bitâso his columns mostly read like Larry King mocks. But even at that age, Hal had amazing sources, so in the middle of the most ridiculous sections you would have these enormous breaking news stories and remarkable bits of fortune telling. In 1993, the Hal column would read something like this: My wife was in the backyard planting petunias and I told her that I think the petunia has to be the prettiest flower. She responded that she always preferred the violet. And I have to admit that violets are nice too â¦ Whatever happened to Joe Lis? He always seemed like a very...</span></a></div>
