Yesterday, midway through an already engaging presentation, one of my students paused during her discussion of the contextual allusions present in her text. &quot;Also,&quot; she said as she made to forward her presentation, &quot;I think there's an allusion to tentacle porn.&quot; The class gasped. Her mouse clicked. I sat mute. Horrified into silence. Time dilated as we approached the horizon of this career-ending event. I held that diphthong in &quot;Wait!&quot; so long it slid into a schwa.
