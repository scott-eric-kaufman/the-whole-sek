Banks' Excession. Is it a great novel? I don't know. Is it a good novel? I don't know. Why don't I know? Because I didn't—because I couldn't—read the novel on its own terms. I spent the entire time awaiting the arrival of a plot that never materialized. Why did I do that? Because of the back cover: [Diplomat Byr Genar-Hofoen has been selected by the Culture to undertake a delicate and dangerous mission. The Department of Special Circumstances—the Culture's espionage and dirty tricks section—has sent him off to investigate a 2,500-year-old mystery: the sudden disappearance of a star fifty times older than the universe itself. But in seeking the secret of the lost sun, Byr risks losing himself. There is only one way to break the silence of millennia: steal the soul of the long-dead starship captain who first encountered the star, and convince her to be reborn. And in accepting this mission, Byr will be swept into a vast conspiracy that could lead the universe into an age of peace . . . or to the brink of annihilation. ] It should go without saying by now that none of that actually happens in the novel. There is a conspiracy and the name is correct—although it refers to only one of the novel's many characters—but the plot points on the back cover all refer to a single dream that character had on pp. 389-391. In retrospect, I find it difficult not to filter the events of the novel back through that short passage, and it almost works: the consciousness of a character (Zreyn Tramow) who witnessed the disappearance of that sun 2,500 years ago is slipped into Byr Genar-Hofoen's dream by a Mind (Grey Area) that plans to make contact with an &quot;Outside Context Problem&quot; (the titular &quot;excession&quot;) similar to the disappearance of that sun, and at the end of the novel Tramow herself is awakened from storage shortly after the Grey Area enters the excession, but these are minor plot points unworthy of even being labeled as spoilers.* Because of the teleology imposed upon the novel by the back cover, however, every other element of the novel is subsumed by this bit of narrative driftwood. That is not to say this subplot is unimportant, merely that it is the equivalent of this: Not that there might not be value to doing that—countless classic novels could be made greater by misdirection of this sort—but this mode of false advertising utterly alters the experience of reading the novel. Were you to read the version of Gravity's Rainbow above, you would spend the whole second half of the novel awaiting the return of the beach-terrorizing octopuses. The back-cover plot summary is as critical a heuristic as the title: we all remember that Introduction to Literature exercise in which the instructor asks you to imagine that the title of the book is Ahab or...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/07/bing-bing-bing-bing-bing-bing-bong-bong-bong.html"><span><strong>Bing? Bing. Bing bing? Bing bing bong. &quot;Bong&quot;? Bong.</strong> Kevin Drum convinced me to do what only John Quiggin ever does and you know what? I have a new appreciation for whatever sort of behind-the-scenes filtering Google does. What did I learn when I &quot;binged&quot; my name? The Good: The pieces Kotsko and I wrote for Inside Higher Ed are linked everywhere: Bookforum, conference presentations, librarian sites, departmental pages, course pages. The Bad: You can't search for links through bing, so the best I can do is tell to you search for my name and go through the thirty pages that show up. The Good: People link to and reprint a lot of what I write at Edge of the American West. The Bad: Many of those &quot;people&quot; are spam-type content aggregators that neither link nor credit me as the author. The Good: Acephalous appears on more course and faculty pages than I can shake a hundred sticks at. The Bad: They invariably refer to me as a &quot;graduate student blogger.&quot; The Good: Many people linked to things I've written in an attempt to engage me in a dialogue. The Bad: Google never told me they did this, so these people likely think I snubbed them. (I didn't! Had I but known I would've responded!) The Good: It seems like bing catches content no matter who it's attributed to, such that searching for my name results in links to what I've written even when my name or a link to one of my blogs isn't included. The Bad: One such site must have had my prose in its metadata, because the only thing visible on the page were pictures of a naked white woman surrounded by fifty naked black men. The Good: The image search doesn't turn up any pictures of me. The Horror: It returns seventeen images of a bearded guy who sorta kinda looks like me smoking a series of gigantic bongs and is identified as &quot;Scott Eric Kaufman from California.&quot; Future potential employers take note: that's not me.</span></a></div>
