<p>In a <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/07/in-the-comments.html#comment-76697574">comment</a> on my earlier <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/07/in-the-comments.html">post</a>, Loki wonders whether &quot;a fourth underline [is] transcribed with an emoticon.&quot;&nbsp; I replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>I believe four underlines is smiley-face, five winking-smiley-face. Thus, your properly transcribed Emily Dickinson poem looks like this:</p></blockquote>

<p>Only what followed the colon wasn't what your properly transcribed Emily Dickinson poem would look like, since it seems no underlines are allowed in comments.&nbsp; They are, however, visible in posts.&nbsp; So <u>HERE</u> <span style="border-bottom: 3px double rgb(255, 255, 153);">NOW</span> is what your properly transcribed Emily Dickinson poem would look like:

</p><blockquote>

<p>Because <u>I</u> could not stop for <span style="border-bottom: 3px double rgb(255, 255, 153);">DEATH</span>:) <br /><u>HE</u> kindly stopped for ME—<br />The Carriage held but just <u>OURSELVES</u>—<br />And <span style="border-bottom: 3px double rgb(255, 255, 153);">IMMORTALITY</span>

</p>

<p>We slowly drove—<span style="border-bottom: 3px double rgb(255, 255, 153);">HE</span> knew no HASTE<br />And I had put away<br />My LABOR and my leisure too<br />For His <u>CIVILITY</u>—</p>

<p>Maybe I'm a stickler for accuracy, but I find this transcription far more charming than one you find in textbooks.&nbsp; I feel <u>CLOSER</u> to the original text, like I'm holding the very manuscript itself in my hands.&nbsp; Maybe I could've been a <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/07/eight-years-ago.html">paleographer</a> after all ...<br /> </p>

		<span id="comment-76738244-content"><p>What Rich said. 8O !! <b>Emily Dickinson</b> don&#39;t need <i>NO</i> emoticons.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.pseudopodium.org/search.cgi?essay=hate+all+kings" rel="nofollow">used to think</a> that the greatest alternate history emoticon would be:</p>

<blockquote>
I hate all kings and the thrones that they sit on<br />
From the hector of France to the cully of Britain.  :)
</blockquote>

<p>After considering the tendency of email to veer toward speech, now I incline toward:</p>

<blockquote>
But people just don&#39;t <i>do</i> such things. :)
</blockquote>

<p>Or maybe:</p>

<blockquote>
And I pray solemnly that the slayer, whoever he is, whether he alone is guilty or he has partners, may, in the horrible way he deserves, wear out his unblest life. And for myself I pray that if he should, with my knowledge, become a resident of my house, I may suffer the same things which I have just called down on others. :)

<p>That said, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much a difference between &quot;natural [handwritten] gestures&quot; and &quot;keyboard equivalents,&quot; esp. not among those of us who type 120 wpm.  What I mean is, yes, I think there&#39;s a relation between gestural ease and expression, I just don&#39;t see the typed equivalent as being any more onerous than the handwritten.  I can italicize in HTML in a fraction of the time it&#39;d take me to underline something by hand; so if you&#39;re correct, I think you&#39;d need to take into account the damn-near-infinite hours most of us have spent hands-to-keyboard, as I think it nullifies swift naturality of pen-to-pad.</p></span>

<p>Like what, eh?  My uncanny ability to write a dissertation in five years?  Typing speed&#39;s irrelevant when you ain&#39;t got anything of importance to say. </p>

<p>That said, it&#39;s interesting how the act of typing mediates our emotional interface with words.  You&#39;re correct that there&#39;s no stabbing-of-pages when typing -- there is, however, a <em>figural</em> stabbing, such that we&#39;re always at one remove from our emotional outbursts in type.  You&#39;d <em>think</em> this would alter for the better the quality of written interaction, but alas, we&#39;re no more temperate now -- perhaps even less so -- than in the halcyon days of the handwritten word.</p>

<p><em>Basically what you&#39;re saying is that ED was an incredibly melodramatic emo teenager.</em></p>

<p>Here and that Henry James fool, yes, most certainly.</p>

<p>Rich, how you manage to remember things you wrote last year amazes me; I can hardly remember things I wrote last week -- I sit there, shocked and embarrassed, every time I edit.  </p></span>

<p>One&#39;s own bad poetry is the best mnemonic.  Good poetry is supposed to achieve its effects without the use of purely personal associations that other people won&#39;t get.  Bad poetry accumulates lines that spark some strong association in the mind of the writer, even though they don&#39;t work for anyone else.</p>

<p>In the case of this particular poem, it&#39;s all about scorning one&#39;s youth / past, which is something that you more or less continually do (as above, where you scorn what you wrote last week, and hardly remember it, as if you&#39;ve just turned up your junior high school diary or something).  Since the poem is about nostalgia, of course it re-presents itself.  (Not that I&#39;d remember where it is or anything.  But Google on acephalous cyborg youth turns it up as the first hit.)</p></span>

Long, well-crafted sentences are more likely to offer examples of subtle, careful rhetoric. I've said before that I'm really attracted to dudes who know how to use a subordinate clause—not because I like Ivy-League dudes who are way into Milton, but because it's a sign that the mind is supple and sees in more colors than black and white. Later, JL quotes Donald Hall on late Henry James: Late James is the best prose for reading aloud. Saying one of his interminable sentences, the voice must drop pitch every time he interrupts his syntax with periphrasis, and drop again when periphrasis interrupts periphrasis, and again, and then step the pitch up, like climbing stairs in the dark, until the original tone concludes the sentence. One's larynx could write a doctoral dissertation on James's syntax. Sandwiched between these two statements are numerous complaints about Twitter, text-messaging, and how they rob one of the ability to discern the subtleties of long sentences generally and late James specifically. When AWB or Hall praises complex sentences, they do so because such sentences require an ear for subtlety the dessicated literalism of a pay-per-word culture deafens one to, i.e. you wouldn't catch James resorting to ALL CAPS for emphasis, because his readers could tease the emphasis from contextual clues. Only as the transcription guide [.pdf] to &quot;Dear Henry James&quot; attests, James frequently employed the nineteenth century equivalent of ALL CAPS: the underline. When his letters are transcribed, his underlining is preserved using ALL CAPS or italics for single underlines, ALL CAPS for double, UNDERLINED ALL CAPS triple, &amp;c. So James' famous exhortation to Edith Wharton usually looks like this: &quot;DO NEW YORK!&quot; The ALL CAPS is understandable there, as it marks the exhortatory nature of an exhortation; however, James regularly underlined words which are already emphatic, such as the emphatic do: &quot;DO be so far as possible his Lady Ripon.&quot; Happens quite a lot. Perhaps this double emphasis is conventional, and that in the course of one of his long, winding late-period sentences he would include no twitter-markers. Here's his 1907 account of a car accident (from a letter to Wharton): Apropos of smashes, two or three days after we had crossed the level crossing of Caianello, near Caserta, SEVEN Neapolitan &quot;smarts&quot; were ALL killed dead—and this by no coming of the train, but simply by furious reckless driving and a deviation, a SLIP, that dashed them against a rock and made an instant end. The Italian driving is CRAPULOUS, and the roads mostly not good enough. I don't think anyone would accuse Wharton of being an unsubtle reader, yet James writes as if his emphasis couldn't be gleaned from contextual clues. All of which leads me to...</span></a></div>
