			<div class="entry-more">
				<p>In <em>Batman Begins</em>, the formative event in Bruce Wayne’s life
is the murder of his unambiguously good parents. To young Wayne, their
commonplace death — nothing atypical about urban violence in
impoverished cities — represents a radical wrong in the moral order of
his universe. The depth of his belief in its wrongness is evident in
the lengths he goes to combat it: the years of training, thieving,
imprisonment, &amp;c. It was all for naught. As Ra’s al Ghul said, when
a city is so corrupt criminal organizations can infiltrate its highest
offices, only a purging fire can set matters right. Nothing more
unusual here than the standard revolution-as-social-reform,
proceduralism-won’t-work line. Given the dystopia that is Gotham in the
first film, Ra’s al Ghul is certainly right.</p>
<p>Wayne’s solution is quasi-proceduralist, inasmuch as he introduces a radical element <em>within the extant social structure</em>
in order to provide Gordon, Dent, and Dawes time and space enough to
prosecute via conventional means. (One of them, or possibly Batman,
says as much in <em>The Dark Knight</em>.) Critical attention focuses
on the opening bank heist and Ledger’s Joker — with good reason — but
the Joker’s rise obscures the results Gordon and Batman have achieved
since the conclusion of <em>Batman Begins</em>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The first film closes with the Falcone mob shattered and an
outsider, Ra’s al Ghul, defeated; but the other mob bosses and the
ordinary violent felons still rule the streets. By the time <em>The Dark Knight</em>
opens, Batman and Gordon have scrubbed Gotham shiny. I mean that
literally: the exterior shots of Gotham reinforce the impression that
the city is cleaner, possessed of an atmosphere light can penetrate.
With Dent’s rise and a crippled mob, Wayne can said to have
accomplished his original goal: create an environment in which
proceduralism can adequately respond to elements aligning against the
body social.</p>
<p>This isn’t the way most critics have viewed the film. The
fashionably against-the-grain reading pairs Dent and the Joker as the
film’s moral foils, but I insist on interpreting the film
counter-counter-intuitively, with Dent a rough equivalent of Wayne’s
father, <em>i.e.</em> a supremely benevolent personality of a sort
that can only exist in a functioning society. Without Batman and
Gordon’s efforts, Dent would’ve been so much piss in the wind. The
Joker, however, is the unique product of a society whose stability is
guaranteed by a man in a giant bat-suit. He is not, as <a href="http://theunapologeticmexican.org/elmachete/2008/07/22/the-dark-knight-on-terror/">Nezua would have it</a>, a stand-in for terrorism <em>writ large</em>
so much as a figure for the Malkin-esque fear that the bell that calls
for prayer tolls for her: irate mullahs, public fatwas, endless
caliphate, &amp;c. </p>
<p>The Joker isn’t a stand-in for terrorists, then, but what clenched
conservatives assume terrorists to be — without plan, without
complaint, without decency, without humanity — so to the “if you, like
me, like Yoo” crowd, Batman’s response is eminently reasonable. Except,
of course, it isn’t: on the one hand, Lucius and Gordon object; on the
other, the Joker doesn’t simply want to see Gotham burn, he wants to
know the identity of the man he believes to be his photo-negative. When
he discovers it as Batman tortures him, his motives shift: now he wants
to destroy not <em>Wayne</em>, not Batman, as it’s Wayne’s support of Dent that threatens to snuff Batman.&nbsp; There is a <em>there</em> there more substantial than the unadulterated nihilism.&nbsp; </p>
<p>His rage may be inscrutable, but it’s not baseless: he can tailor
his formative myth to fit the fears of his victim because, it seems,
he’s not invested in it. Both versions presented in the film involve a
private, family trauma — were I psychoanalytically inclined, I’d say
this means the truth either 1) involves a private, family trauma or 2)
doesn’t involve a private, family trauma, <em>i.e.</em> he either
picks at old scars or points in irrelevant directions. The truth is
less important here than the compulsion it creates: unlike common
criminals and mid-level mob lackeys, the Joker won’t scare and won’t
quit.</p>
<p>The tension at the core of Frank Miller’s <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>
evinces itself here: only so long as Wayne is in peak physical
condition will he be able to stabilize the social order. This
stabilization is, to Wayne’s mind, a temporary fix to an structural
problem whose solution is not, as we learn in both the graphic novel
and early the second film, Batman-impersonators. In the graphic novel,
Wayne unites his impersonator and leads an army of sycophants <em>who paint their faces white and smear Batman’s symbol around their eyes</em>.&nbsp; Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Miller’s Batman can rally an army comprised of people who, like the Joker, are a direct result of his actions, <em>i.e.</em> neither future Batman’s army nor the Joker can self-fashion.&nbsp; Billionaire playboy-<em>cum</em>-caped vigilante Bruce Wayne believes himself to be self-fashioned — What <em>is</em>
the use of all those push-ups if he can’t even lift a bloody log? — but
he is as much a creation of extraordinary circumstance as the Joker.
Had he not been a billionaire scion; had he not fallen into a well as a
child; had the well not been full of bats; had the feature not had
bats; had his parents not been killed; had he shot Chill; had he not run
away; &amp;c. He incorporates the circumstances responsible for his
transformation into Batman into his self-fashioned self, but in the
same way Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia. He is his own
perpetually revised narrative of self. These revisions don’t trouble
the viewer, as he or she is familiar with them. Were the roles reversed
— were this a Joker franchise, focused on the particulars of his
descent into arch-criminality — and a man in a bat-suit hounded the
Joker’s every move, Batman would be equally inscrutable. All of which
is a tedious, roundabout way of stating the obvious: just because we’re
not told what’s there doesn’t mean there’s nothing there.</p>
<p>This post became unwieldy nine graphs back, so let me cut to the
chase: Dent’s mental collapse shocks Wayne because he
borrowed the faith he invested in Dent from his father’s stock, such
that he sees what might have become had his mother died alone that
night. In short, in Dent he sees the potential for rot everywhere, in
everything, even his father’s cartoonishly unambiguous good. The Joker
doesn’t factor into this equation. He is an agent of chaos in the
diminutive sense: a <em>mere</em> agent, an irrational actor in an agency grown so large his actions exist beneath its perceptual threshold.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The people of Gotham would, of course, disagree, since the Joker’s
the only visible foil — but this is only because Batman and Gordon
decide to suppress Dent’s descent into Two-Face. Better the city
believe in the machinery of conventional politics and condemn Batman
for acting outside it than for them to believe even its shiniest cogs
are corruptible. While Nolan criticizes the current administration’s
commitment to total surveillance <em>ad infinitem</em> by limiting its
purview to the current state of emergency, he does seem to embrace the
neoconservative rationale of lying to the public for their own benefit.
The public doesn’t know what it would mean to create a stable,
pro-American democracy in the Middle East, and if the only way to do so
is talk about uranium enrichment or al Qaeda connections, so be it —
they’ll thank us in the end. </p>
<p><em>Only we don’t</em>.&nbsp; Not in the film, at least.&nbsp; The final two minutes of the film are unsettling <em>because</em>, not <em>in spite of</em>
our knowledge of the stakes. We know the consequences of these lies,
and as Batman wheels off into the night, we can already imagine what’ll
happen when Wayne somehow discovers the contents of the letter Alfred
burned from Dawes; when the public discovers the new criminal
mastermind, Two-Face, was once Harvey Dent; &amp;c. Nolan prepares us
for the private and public backlash against those who head-fake us
because <em>they care</em>.</p>

<p>In your post you write the following:</p>

<p>While Nolan criticizes the current administration’s commitment to total surveillance ad infinitem by limiting its purview to the current state of emergency, he does seem to embrace the neoconservative rationale of lying to the public for their own benefit. The public doesn’t know what it would mean to create a stable, pro-American democracy in the Middle East, and if the only way to do so is talk about uranium enrichment or al Qaeda connections, so be it — they’ll thank us in the end.</p>

<p><br />
I agree with you on the first part, but I&#39;m not totally sure how Batman&#39;s use of super-surveillance technology has much to do with the lie that he concocts with Gordon, nor would I argue that Nolan believes that lying to the public is in the public&#39;s own best interest. I am reluctant to connect the extra-legal surveillance of the populace in the moment of exception with lying to the public, because I do not believe the film connects them. The first is a temporary but premeditated act initiated by Batman and Fox and is not made public. The second is a seemingly permanent, but impromptu action agreed upon by Batman and Gordon and deceives the public. No one expects Batman to operate publicly, his very identity is secret and his whole operation disguised from the public, and furthermore his surveillance is in no way condoned or acknowledged by the police department. How could it? They don&#39;t even know that Batman did it. On the other hand, Gordon&#39;s actions violate the public&#39;s trust by first working with a vigilante and second by framing him for crime he did not commit. </p>

<p>However, while the film does justify the temporary surveillance - and really within the world of The Dark Knight its hard not to justify - I don&#39;t think it does justify Batman and Gordon&#39;s action to lie to the public. As I wrote in my own post on the film, Gordon and Batman succumb to the Joker&#39;s logic when it comes to society and I believe the film is  quite ambivalent about it. The Joker long holds to the theory that society only operates, survives, and sustains itself by the lies it is willing to tell itself. Underneath all that vernier of civilization, the Joker argues, is a pack of wild dogs. However, this view seems to not be wholly endorsed by the film itself. While the populace is at times driven to madness and is willing to kill anyone to restore order to the city (the whole Mr. Reese plot thread), this does not always hold true. The two groups of hostages on the boats opt not to kill each other given the opportunity to save themselves. In fact, its only the elites of the film (Wayne-Batman, Gordon, Dent-Two Face) who hold to the notion that people are strictly motivated by inspiration from above.  What we witness when Gordon and Batman concoct their story is their moral fall, motivated of course, by trying to do the right thing. However, there notion of what is right, has reinforced the Joker&#39;s view of what society is, even as the film seems to doubt the certainty of his moral nihilism. </p></span>

<p>ASK, I only meant the surveillance bit to speak to the first part, not the second, <em>i.e.</em> I don&#39;t think it has much to do with lying in the interest of the public good.</p>

<p><em>The second is a seemingly permanent, but impromptu action agreed upon by Batman and Gordon and deceives the public. No one expects Batman to operate publicly, his very identity is secret and his whole operation disguised from the public, and furthermore his surveillance is in no way condoned or acknowledged by the police department.</em></p>

<p>What had been, throughout the first film and well into the second, a tacit promise of mutual aid is revoked by <em>The Dark Knight</em>&#39;s end.  Think about when the banker was returned from Hong Kong: the newscasters <em>joked</em> about how he happened to arrive, gift-wrapped, on the steps of city hall (or whatever law enforcement HQ it was).  Everyone knew Batman was responsible, and before he had the deaths of five police officers pinned to him, supported him.  The Joker&#39;s (re-)actions shook their faith, but it&#39;s the murder of the city&#39;s ordinary, legitimate defenders that&#39;ll push public opinion against him for good.</p>

<p><em> In fact, its only the elites of the film (Wayne-Batman, Gordon, Dent-Two Face) who hold to the notion that people are strictly motivated by inspiration from above.

<p>This seems damn smart, and I&#39;m not inclined to disagree with it.  I like the notion of the film tugging against its own strings, as that neatly described the ambivalence I felt leaving the theater.  Let me think about this some more -- and rewatch the film, once I return to civilization -- and get back to you.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/07/on-ruining-it.html"><span><strong>On ruining it</strong> (x-posted, painfully, teaspooon by teaspoon) The oddest complaint I've read about The Dark Knight is that its use of a philosophical stalwart, &quot;the trolley problem,&quot; makes the film predictable to a certain tribe of cinematic sophisticates—as if all summer action films employ classic ethical problems and director Christopher Nolan's execution was simply sloppy. High-minded as they're meant to sound, such criticisms reveal the basic ignorance of the folks who mouth them: the purpose of stripping the problem of all context—of discussing &quot;five people&quot; or &quot;a fat man&quot; instead of &quot;your Aunt Eloise&quot; or &quot;your dog Phil&quot;—is to remove as much emotionally-charged information as can be removed from the larger ethical concerns under considerations. Nolan deliberately presses against abstraction, dressing these bare philosophical bones with the accoutrements of character, then enlivening the situation by placing these characters in jeopardy. Knowing the various moral, ethical and political arguments about the trolley problem doesn't ruin the experience of The Dark Knight any more than knowing how to play chess ruins your appreciation of an elegant endgame. (Unless, I suppose, you're a fervert partisan of one proposed solution and Batman's decisions disappointed you, in which case, take it up with him.) If you want an example of too much knowledge ruining something, consult the Star Wars cycle—or whatever its legions call it—as George Lucas' decisions to prequel robs the only three decent films of all dramatic effect. Consider the first-time viewer who decides, quite rationally, to begin watching the whatever-they-call-it with Episode I. In it, he learns Anakin Skywalker is quick-tempered but fundamentally decent-hearted. In Episode II or III—I've only watched them once and am not in a position to research fine points at the moment—he learns Anakin Skywalker fathers twins, one of whom is whisked away by some senatorial aide or whatever, the other to a small desert planet. I'm probably punting the details here, but it's only because I don't care they're irrelevant. My point is future viewers of Episodes IV won't wonder who Obi-Wan really is; won't be surprised in Episode V when Vadar is revealed to be Luke's father; and will consider Vadar's redemption in Episode VI a return to form. Lucas hasn't added to his legacy, he's added spoilers to the only part of it worth preserving. A more interesting example comes from Iain M. Banks' Consider Phlebas, which comes from the &quot;Death by Water&quot; sectioned of T.S. Eliot's The Wasteland: Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead, Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell And the profit and loss. A current under sea Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell He passes the stages of his age and youth Entering the whirlpool. Gentile or Jew O you who turn the wheel and look to windward, Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you Do you consider its titular allusion a spoiler? For those who've read the novel, did it diminish your enjoyment? Or is it obscure and/or clever enough to keep...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/07/teddy-in-tights.html"><span><strong>Teddy in tights?</strong> (x-posted.) As the premier Dark Knight poster ’round these parts, it has been demanded of, er, falls upon me to draw your attention to an interview with Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale in which the pair reveal their Batman is based on Edmund Morris’ The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt and Theodore Rex.* In the interview, Bale admits to confusion when the Nolans — brother Jonathan co-writes Christopher’s films — insisted he read The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt before they began principle photography on Batman Begins. Nolan then explains (and I paraphrase): Batman’s not as unique as people think. Grant Bob Kane’s Gotham is New York and Batman has a direct historical precedent in Theodore Roosevelt. His father, Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., had been one of the city’s preeminent philanthropists — having found and funded the New York City Children’s Aid Society, the Met, and the American Museum of Natural History, to name a few of his charitable works — and died in a way Morris contends traumatized his son: suddenly, from a cancer whose existence he’d hidden, and mere hours before Theodore returned from Harvard. In 1884, his beloved mother and wife died in the same house, on the same day. A bereft Roosevelt set out for the Dakota Territory shortly thereafter. He spent his time in the hinterlands learning how to be a proper police, then applied those lessons when he became president of the New York City Police Commissioners in 1895. Like Batman, Roosevelt employed bleeding-edge technology into his crime-fighting: under his watch, telephones were installed in precincts, bicycles were deployed on beats, and various criminal identification systems, like Bertillonage, were monkeyed about with. Nolan’s statement resonates with many a recent discussion about the Roosevelt’s legacy vis-a-vis the current administration. If Bush-is-Batman and Batman-is-Roosevelt, logic demands that middle be distributed and then it’s case closed, verdict delivered, suit settle, put a period on it already: Bush-is-as-Batman as Socrates-is-mortal. The which-president-is-more-Airwolf-Batman debate aside, Nolan’s decision to craft Batman’s appeal after Roosevelt’s is ridiculously savvy, inasmuch as it speaks to that most cherished (if post-dated) primal American myths: self-invention. In Batman Begins, the young Bruce Wayne isn’t some spectacular physical specimen; in fact, he’s thin, fragile, and perpetually frightened. Nolan’s direction reinforces this: he’s either in tears, bed, or the bottom of a well in every shot. Even Bale’s adolescent Wayne, returned from school for Chill’s parole hearing, buries a wisp-thin frame beneath layers of clothes as if to prevent circumstance from buffeting his head into a doorknob. The first act of Batman Begins plays directly into the Roosevelt mystique, i.e. the frail boy who refines his body into a weapon. The first film ends, then, much where Morris’ Rise does: his reputation established, his name to be reckoned with, but his future uncertain. Where does this self-made man fit in the political machine in which he’ll have to function? What compromises must he make? What ideals must he betray in order to act upon? I can’t do much in the...</span></a></div>
