<br />In “<a href="http://jacobinmag.com/2013/08/on-geek-culture/#sthash.iCIsDcaF.dpuf">On Geek Culture</a>,” Ian Williams collapses geek and sport cultures into each other by claiming both are tribal manifestations of brand loyalty:
<p>&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In  my beloved roleplaying game circles, doxing and 
threats of violence  over the internet occur regularly over which 
edition of Dungeons and  Dragons people prefer. Go to any video game 
forum and one can see pages  of arguments about which console is the 
“right” one to enjoy. On and on  it goes, across intellectual properties
 and hobbies, right down to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/may/15/university-norwich-star-wars-club-fight">nearly breaking out in actual physical violence</a>.</p>
<p>This is remarkably similar to diehard sports fan culture. It’s not  
merely that a disagreement exists over which consumed product is  
superior; it’s that the fan of the other team is an Other. This, again, 
 blurs the lines between what we think of as geek fandom and non-geek.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On its face, the idea that geek-love for a particular franchise is 
the psychological equivalent of devotion to a particular athletic team 
makes sense: both are characterized by an over-identification with the 
central figures in an ongoing drama, be it the trials of a fictional 
protagonist or the tribulations of a team seemingly committed to never 
cracking .500. And in both cases, these figures are representatives of 
corporate media, such that it doesn’t matter to the BBC who plays the 
Doctor, so long as the show itself is successful, anymore than it 
matters to the NFL who wins the Super Bowl, so long as the game itself 
is an obscene encomium to American capitalism.</p>
<p>For Williams, the corporate nature of the objects of fandom overrides
 the differences between how those objects are related to. 
“Neoliberalism,” he claims, “has made geeks of us all: jocks, nerds, and
 dweebs alike,” and so he suggests that we make “a concerted effort to 
free the media being consumed from the corporate realm.” As sentiments 
go, that’s a lovely one; but as statements about reality go, it 
indicates that Williams isn’t remotely familiar with geek culture. That 
should’ve been apparent when he linked to a fight at a <em>Star Wars </em>club and claimed “[t]his is remarkably similar to diehard sports fan culture.”</p>
<p>His entire argument relies on that analogy, but his diction betrays 
that he lacks confidence in it. Depending on how remarkable you prefer 
your similarities, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_badger">honey badger</a> is “remarkably similar” to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_chipmunk">the least chipmunk</a>.
 They share a kingdom, phylum, and class, which any 19th Century 
naturalist will tell you means that they’re more similar than not. Ask 
the same 19th Century naturalist which one he’d rather be locked in a 
small box with, however, and you’d quickly learn that the differences 
between them are more significant than their similarities are 
remarkable. (Only one, for example, is a vainglorious carnivore.) Point 
being, the <em>rare</em> instance of verbal arguments leading to 
physical altercations in geek culture shouldn’t be the basis of an 
analogy to a sport culture in which such an escalation is <em>common</em>.</p>
<p>So, Williams’s argument on the corporate nature of geek culture 
relies on an analogy that only works from a logical remove so distant as
 to be useless. Which isn’t to say that there isn’t a corporate 
component to geek culture, as there certainly is, but that component 
operates in a vastly different way than its correlate in sport culture. 
If you’re a Mets fan, you watch them play on SNY or at Citifield and you
 purchase uniforms and gear from officially licensed MLB manufacturers. 
With a few notable exceptions—homemade posters or creepy homespun Mr. 
Met costumes—your participation in the team culture is mediated 
through corporate entities. You don’t often witness the melting visage 
of a paper-mache Mr. Met roaming the stands of Citifield, but you can’t 
attend a comic conference without seeing twenty Wolverines sporting 
alarmingly sharp-looking claws. That’s because the participatory nature 
of geek culture is expansive—the object originates in a corporate 
entity but isn’t limited to it—whereas the more you participate in 
sport culture, the more money you deposit in the pockets of the 
corporations that own it.</p>
<p>This is a basic fact of geek culture: while a person <em>can </em>participate
 it by buying a Batman costume officially licensed by DC Comics, he or 
she can also—and for the most part does—participate in it by 
purchasing ceramic plates and blackout drapes and transforming them into
 something resembling a Batsuit. I understand the desire to vilify 
corporations for their pernicious effect on contemporary culture, but I 
don’t think such condemnations require us to minimize the differences 
between subcultures in what, to my eyes, seems like an attempt to create
 a monolithic subculture. I’m not sure what good a united front of geeks
 and sport fans would have on American society at large, especially if 
the bond between them is <em>a weak analogy based on violent tribalist tendencies.</em></p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0192ac708a86970d-content"><p>This is well-trodden ground, but I am still amazed by how mainstream geek culture--fantasy in particular-- has become since my youth. I was embarrassed to admit my love of Lord of the Rings when I was a kid, and my attempts to get my friends to play D&amp;D were always doomed. Now, *normal people* openly admit to watching Game of Thrones. Partially, this is a cultural shift driven by technology, I feel like-- the CGI in the Peter Jackson movies and the Harry Potter series meant that people who weren&#39;t natural readers enter into an imaginary world more easily, which then meant the books became more accessible, and a broader group of people could participate in dialogue about them, in a virtuous or vicious circle depending on your preconceptions. </p>

<p>The other side is that geek culture seems to become less geeky as it becomes more mainstream, with fewer passionate adherents to AD&amp;D 2nd Edition or whatever and more just low-key appreciation. When the imaginary world you love exists only in your head and in the heads of a few other people, perhaps it can become the object of fanaticism more easily than when it is a glitteringly obvious cultural phenomenon accessible to all.</p></span>

The bad analogies go all the way down--comparing television characters to corporate mascots, for instance. It felt pretty vulgar Marxist, honestly, as much of Jacobin does. Associate x with corporatism, dismiss x, article is finished. The article on geekdom and ethnicity which it links is better, thankfully.</p></span>

(And the article's about vodka no less.) In addition to writing articles, my duties at The Raw Story will include pulling and titling links to wire stories. They won't be under my byline, but I have a feeling you'll be able to tell which ones are mine. I'll still be writing here, though, as my job doesn't entail the kind of editorializing I'm incapable of not doing. As a matter of fact, I'll still be here when my other other gig starts on the 15th. (But more on that later.)</span></a></div>

The caption to the above photograph, for example, reads “[a]fter his lunch Matt wandered around, ending up sitting on someone’s front step,” which is essentially a Yiddish insult. (My grandmother never actually said “you should wander around and end up sitting on some stranger’s stoop,” but I can easily imagine her doing so.) The Jewish futility doesn’t end there: Matt seemed to blend into the crowd as he spent a relaxed day on his own, as passers by seemed oblivious to who he was. [&quot;You relax like a nobody&quot; or &quot;You and nine men don't make a minyan.&quot;] Matt didn’t seem bothered by the fact that he was spending the day by himself, wanting to work on his own. [&quot;As you work so will you die.&quot;] Reading over the script, Matt seemed to be considering the new part, as he tried to make a name for himself in Hollywood. [&quot;Try to make a name for yourself different from mine.&quot;] The 30-year-old chomped away on his sandwich outside the eatery, obviously not worried about being spotted. [&quot;When you slobber away, only God's watching.&quot;] The star seemed happy as he spent alone, moving on with his career in the US. [&quot;May you grow up and live in Los Angeles.&quot;] Which means that, yes, I may be the first person ever to pass time in Mississippi writing ersatz Yiddish insults.</span></a></div>
