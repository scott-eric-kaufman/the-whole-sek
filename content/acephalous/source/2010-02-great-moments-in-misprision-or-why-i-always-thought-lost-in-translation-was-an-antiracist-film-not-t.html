			I&#39;m having one of those moments in which I wonder whether I was watching the same movie everyone else was.&#0160; At <em>Racialicious</em>, Thea Lim <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2010/02/18/complex-magazine-the-50-most-racist-movies-you-didnt-know-were-racist/">discusses</a> <em>Complex Magazine</em>&#39;s list of <a href="http://best.complex.com/lists/The-50-Most-Racist-Movies">The 50 Most Racist Movies You Didn&#39;t Know Were Racist</a>,
and while the majority of the list disappoints (on account of me
already knowing the overtly racist films listed were racist), some of
the entries simply baffle me.&#0160; Foremost among them is <em>Bulworth</em>,
Warren Beatty&#39;s film about the centrist penchant to use blacks as
electoral pawns—Bulworth won&#39;t die in defense of his principles, but he
will commit suicide for a lobbyist payday, at least until he realizes
that black people are really people, at which point American political
logic demands he be assassinated—but not far behind is Sopphia
Coppola&#39;s <em>Lost in Translation</em>, which Lim glosses thus:<br /><blockquote>[T]he
whole point of the movie disgusts me. As in, the nauseatingly
self-indulgent focus on the deep, brooding subjectivity of two
Anglo-Americans, against a backdrop of depthless Japanese people who,
with their hilariously absurd subcultures, bizarre language and
affinity for bowing, are all exactly the same.</blockquote>Lim then quotes a section about <a href="http://restructure.wordpress.com/2010/02/15/white-people-dont-understand-people-of-colors-existential-angst/">self-involved white cluelessness</a> from <em>Restructure!</em>:<br /><blockquote>[W]hat disgusts me about <em>Lost in Translation</em> is that it centers on the lives of white people in a country where they are the minority, and it suggests that <em>the <strong>social isolation</strong> that comes from <strong>being a minority</strong> is something that could only happen to <strong>white people</strong></em>.</blockquote>I&#39;m
not sure why either writer assumes that the experience Coppola
describes in the film is something that can only happen to white
people, because to me, the film seems to do the exact opposite: it
demonstrates that white Americans are emotionally and intellectually
unprepared to understand the non-majoritarian social experience.&#0160; So
maybe it does describe an experience that can only happen to white
people—but only because white people are alone in being unable to
recognize their privilege for what it is.&#0160; Neither Bill Murray&#39;s &quot;Bob&quot;
nor Scarlett Johansson&#39;s &quot;Charlotte&quot; have given a moment&#39;s thought to
the plight of non-whites in American society, so the events of the film
represent their first encounter with any form of
double-consciousness—even one in which their whiteness still affords
them privileged social stature. <br /><br />The film begins with
caricature and absurdity because these characters are incapable of
understanding Japanese society, or their roles as others in that
society understand them to be; <em>e.g.</em> Bob is baffled by the
arrival of an escort because he is unfamiliar with the sexism endemic
in traditional Japanese business culture.&#0160; Charlotte knows one of her
roles—that of the tourist in exotic Japan—and indulges in some
Orientalist fare, visiting a temple to watch some monks chant.&#0160; Their
relationship, such as it is, is only possible in an environment in
which their previously stable and unquestioned identities have
dissolved in the face of their own otherness.&#0160; I took this to be a
criticism of American insularity and arrogance, not an assertion of its
eternal provenance.<br /><br />To an American audience, it may seem as if
the Japanese in the film are the foreigners; but from the Japanese
perspective, the film registers as a story of two unmoored Americans
bumbling through a culture they can&#39;t understand on its own terms.&#0160;
Unlike most films in which the white interlopers have adventures with
the natives, <em>Lost in Translation</em> never demands its audience
believe that white culture is inherently superior.&#0160; Bob and Charlotte
are not bequeathed the preternatural ingenuity or Rooseveltian
ruggedness so common among American characters abroad; they are, in
fact, technologically illiterate representatives of an ostensibly
superior culture who, in a reversal of the minstral trope, sing the
songs of their ancestral homeland, England, from whence Brian Ferry and
Roxy Music came.<br /><br />All of which is only to say, I never realize how contrarian my reading of the film was until I read the <em>Racialicious</em> and <em>Restructured!</em> posts, because I had always thought <em>Lost in Translation</em>
a remarkable feat: for white audiences, it only works as a film if they
force themselves to imagine a subject position in which they are
foreign but not superior—a situation in which white characters are not
there to civilize noble savages or ravage native cultures with tongues,
guns, or both.&#0160; These are privileged white people who are, to quote &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfgU4iQr8PU">More Than This</a>,&quot; &quot;hopefully learning&quot; that their identities are contingent upon a social structure <em>and</em>
that that social structure is different, but not superior, to the one
in which they currently find themselves.&#0160; For non-white audiences, I can
understand why this revelation would feel underwhelming; after all, Bob
and Charlotte are learning late in life what they&#39;ve known,
exquisitely, for the entirety of theirs. <br /><br />The Japanese in the
film are depthless, but only in the first act—as the Americans learn
more about Japanese culture, these characters become slightly less
inscrutible.&#0160; Were this the sort of film in which the white
anthropologists almost instantly acquire intimate knowledge of the
primitive culture in which they&#39;re immersed, the film would have closed
with scenes of Bob and Charlotte conversing with three-dimensional
characters in fluent Japanese; but because the pair&#39;s otherness and
ignorance is so great, it ends with Japanese characters who are only
marginally rounder than they were when it began.&#0160; Put differently: if we
were to impose this narrative onto, say, <em>The Last Samuri</em>, Tom
Cruise would have arrived in Japan, been thoroughly confused by what he
found, then fled the country feeling alienated and unconvinced of his
cultural superiority. <br /><br />Which, I think, would have been a good
thing.&#0160; In all seriousness, how many movies subvert white America&#39;s
innate sense of superiority on the sly?

Hell, if White Dog is racist, there&#39;s a better case to be made for Guess Who&#39;s Coming To Dinner, whose message seems to be that class trumps all. Great!</p>

<p>(the treatment of Scarface is pretty clumsy too. Sure, it&#39;s a ridiculous stereotype; on the other hand, it&#39;s not as though ethnic minorities have exactly been turned off by the film...ignoring the film&#39;s cultural effect is a pretty hamfisted way to read)</p></span>

Minority/majority make so sense as critical terms when it comes to 2000-era Japan/American relations.  The Japanese are FAR better off, economically, than the Americans.  It&#39;s only a creepy cultural bigotry that could possibly see the economic victors of capitalism -- the Japanese -- as some oppressed native culture.  </p>

<p>Instead, what we really see in the movie is a washed up actor whose only role is a campy bone thrown to him by his Japanese bosses.  And a woman who agrees to go to Japan so her husband can photograph the cultural elite in/of Japan.  </p>

<p>And let&#39;s not be gentle: other cultures&#39; customs are weird.  If they weren&#39;t, then they couldn&#39;t be described as other cultures.  If this were a film about Japanese tourists in a weird American environment -- like, say, *Mystery Train* -- no one would complain.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01310f20bb77970c-content"><p>I knew the <i>Lost in Translation</i> conversations weren&#39;t for me when someone objected to Johannson&#39;s character attending a (Japanese) wedding for people she didn&#39;t know and finding it poignant.  Because, you see, when a foreign culture causes a white person to reflect on their own situation, that is <i>automatically</i> a case of colonization and cultural appropriation, and the foreign culture is <i>necessarily</i> being treated disrespectfully, as a shallow prop.  Cripes, what lazy thinking.</p>

<p>The only part of that movie that I think was genuinely racist was the scene with the prostitute, which is the only part where the Japanese are being made fun of for being stereotypically Japanese: being prostitutes (or sending prostitutes to your room), mixing up r&#39;s and l&#39;s, etc.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the list, it unfortunately reminds me why I spend so little time in the anti-racist and anti-sexist blogospheres.  Plenty of good work being done there, no question, but stuff like this list—where we put <i>The Air Up There</i> in the stocks one more time to jeer and spit at, just in case anyone forgot how bad it was (that movie is more than fifteen years old! Has anyone rented it since the Clinton administration?)—are so unbelievably lazy and smug that the thought of someone actually spending a few hours typing it all out makes me feel very, very tired.</p></span>

Your arguments about <i>Lost in Translation</i> have no standing with her, because in her understanding whites are the most enfranchised people in any setting, whereas your opinion is based on the idea that there are places in which white people are &#39;the wrong kind of people.&#39;  For Thea Lim to work with your argument she would first have to allow the existence of a paradoxical place where white people are literally not white.<br />
Of course my reading is probably too cruel, a childish reaction to the generally infuriating nature of the original <i>Complex Magazine</i> feature, but Thea Lim honestly strikes me as someone emotionally and intellectually unprepared to understand the non-minoritarian social experience.</p></span>

But even if we ignore the many, many instances of racism between non-white ethnic groups, white racial oppression still has always been, as Endy characterizes it, situational, whether through official repression by a white majority or ruling class, or through an unofficial, and in many cases unconscious, expression of in-group mentality. The take-away point is that painting racism as essentially and universally white-versus-nonwhite, with the white as the oppressor, is a pitifully limited understanding of how racism works. </p></span>

<p>A lot of good point also about how much of the list (The Air Up There et al) don&#39;t make sense on a list of &quot;secretly&quot; racist movies. </p>

<p>There&#39;s yet amother category of errors in this list, though, the best example of which is Ace Ventura 2: When Nature Calls. This movie is not racist. I know this because racism in a film is a flaw, and that film has no flaws. QED.</p></span>

<p>I was borderline offended by the inclusion of the <i>Siege</i>, which I see as prescient.  America will toss everything overboard when attacked, torture and recrimination of the Muslim minority will make it worse, and, as more and more abuses are perpetrated, even Arabs/Muslims who originally were willing to join the cause of universal values (as exemplified by Benning and Washington) will turn against the US for not living up to its own rhetoric. </p>

<p>Since basically that&#39;s what happened, albeit mostly overseas, the movie only missed the massive US direct payment to one day terrorists/the next day allies characters.  otherwise, it&#39;s a scenery change away from being a historical documentary</p>

I mean, if anything, I thought it assaulted our complacence as viewers a bit too much- but, no, apparently I&#39;m reading too much into it.</p></span>

Friday Night Lights has leveled up.</strong> I have no actual proof that Peter Berg, Brian Grazer and David Nevins—the production team responsible for the NBC drama Friday Night Lights—play role playing games, but having watched the first season of their show, I have a hard time believing that they don't. Solid narrative involves character development, that's a given; but rarely is that development so abrupt that it seems as if the characters have reached a new level. For example, when the paralyzed former quarterback, Jason Street, teaches the new quarterback, Matt Saracen, a fade pattern that Saracen insists he lacks the arm strength to throw, his first two attempts prove that he does, in fact, lack the arm strength to throw that outside fade. Then, as if throwing it two times earned him enough experience points to level up, Saracen hits his receiver's outside shoulder not once, not twice, but consistently, and for the remainder of the season. I initially thought this phenomenon was limited to the acquisition of greater physical gifts, and chalked it up to the production team's desire to show improvement without having to regularly resort to montages; but as the season progressed, it became clear that this logic also applied to the character's emotional and intellectual development. For example, when the wildly irresponsible Tim Riggins first encounters the annoying son of the single mother who moved in next door, he treats the child like all wildly irresponsible teenagers treat annoying third-graders; then, on a day when he is spectacularly hungover, Riggins converses with the boy and temporarily fortifies his Intelligence attribute enough to provide him the mana required to cast an ensouling spell, which he does, resulting in a permanent +1 bump to his total magicka. Has there ever been another series in which character development was this aggressively tiered?</span></a></div>
