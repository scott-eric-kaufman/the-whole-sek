<p>That I don&#39;t know.  I can&#39;t assume he did, though, because he insisted he was the only one able to reproduce his technique . . . but since the freshmen anthology wasn&#39;t an extant artifact when he wrote the poem, I&#39;m assuming he thought the image would be preserved somehow, or intended it to at least.  I don&#39;t know.  Are there any Blake scholars in the house?</p></span>

<p>He could manage a fair approximation of Michelangelo . . . in <em>relief etching</em>.  By which I mean, he could&#39;ve drawn himself a fine and fulsome tiger had he desired to do so.  But he didn&#39;t.  (I can&#39;t link directly to the British Museum because of, well, I don&#39;t know why, but it has something to do with JavaScript.  Point being, if you google &quot;Blake&quot; and &quot;British Museum,&quot; you&#39;ll be taken to Blake&#39;s very skilled anatomies, which point to Occam slicing unjustly in this instance.)</p></span>

<p>But if you&#39;re allowing that he does indeed draw people very well, then look at the tiger&#39;s face. Forget the rest of the drawing and notice the wide eyes, tiny pupils, the worry lines that extend backwards, and the downturned mouth. They are all typical, simplistic, human facial expressions or worry, sorrow, general whimpering. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still trying to understand the association between the two, as somehow I&#39;ve always read &quot;The Tyger&quot; as less fierce, and somehow more melancholy but had never seen the drawing before.</p></span>

Songs of Experience are contrasting to those of Innocence. Blakes &#39;Experience&#39; is once the veil of Innocence is corrupted by environment, by carnal knowledge, by cynicism, suspicion and society.  The &#39;innocent&#39; would have depicted the Tyger below, its ideal of what a Tyger looks like.  The top Tyger being a metaphor for the ravages of life and effect on a creature normally portrayed as magnificent. As you quite rightly said, his etchings were always intended to be presented with his verse as a signifyer.  </p></span>

It should come as no surprise that my favorite prepackaged lecture focuses on the importance of historical context to rhetorical analysis. What I try to do is throw so much context at them that by the end of class they feel alienated from their own cultural moment. That way when they discuss the context of these works they're forced to sift through quite a bit of information and deem what bits of it are relevant to the rhetorical situation. It usually goes something like this: Only today as soon as I mentioned House the following ensued: STUDENT #1: KUTNER! HALF THE CLASS: What about Kutner? STUDENT #2: Don't spoil it! HALF THE CLASS: What is there to spoil about Kutner? SEK: There will be no spoilers in this classroom! STUDENT #1: But you just told us Superman saves everybody on the plane. SEK: Superman saving everyone isn't a spoiler. That's what has to happen. (pauses a beat to let the students settle) HALF THE CLASS: Seriously you guys did something happen to Kutner? Normally I wouldn't comment on this, but the outpouring of affection my ninety-five percent minority class had for Kal Penn's character makes me think the rationale behind suiciding Kutner might be more compelling than it first sounds.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/prelude-to-a-scene-analysis-of-bryan-singers-superman-returns.html"><span><strong>Prelude to a scene analysis of Bryan Singer's Superman Returns</strong> (The analysis itself spiraled out of control because Bryan Singer is a lunatic who bobs and weaves and cuts constantly. More on that tomorrow.) It goes without saying that Bryan Singer's Superman Returns (2006) is not a very good film. Or so I thought before hitting up Rotten Tomatoes. Let me put it this way: I think Superman Returns is a mediocre but interesting film. If you look at my chart you can probably guess why: the film mines the imagery of 9/11 in order to address the shit mist of uncertainty Americans fumbled through from 9/12 forward. The Americans in the film had themselves a Superman and the supreme confidence having a Superman entails. Then they lost him. Suddenly and inexplicably. Singer wants his audience to imagine what it would be like to wake up one morning and realize that the truly terrible things that never happen here can now happen here. Not too hard. I remember staring numbly at video of the first Tower smoking when I saw the nose of the second plane enter the frame: I was watching the truly terrible things that never happen here happening here and I felt sick. The sense of security I lost that morning never returned. No amount of anything will ever bring it back . . . with the possible exception of the arrival of Superman. The Americans in the film have learned to live without Superman. Or so they tell themselves. Lois Lane wins a Pulitzer for a stiff upper lip of an article entitled &quot;Why the World Doesn't Need Superman&quot; but the article has all the conviction of an empty gesture. (&quot;I never really loved you either!&quot; says the man whose girlfriend just left him.) When Clark Kent suddenly reappears after five years of being elsewhere, the audience knows what the Americans in the film don't: they can quiet that nagging nothing in the pit of their guts and breathe a little easier because Superman is back. Untangling why actual Americans are happy for their fake brethren is something of a chore, so let me leave it at this: 9/11 so rattled our presumptions that we experience real pleasure at the very thought that someone out there might reclaim some of the gusto they lost that morning even if that someone is an imitation American on a Sydney sound stage. Whatever the circumstances, the film's most powerful moment was always going to be when Superman reappeared. But Singer goes one step further and stages this scene in a manner designed to prime our 9/11 pumps without calling attention to what makes us shit the sheets (terrorism generally and Islamic fundamentalism in particular). All the props are there—the airplanes, the New York City landmarks, the air traffic controllers—but Singer stripped them of their normal significance so they only horrify secondhandedly. The scene I'll analyze tomorrow is equivalent to what the man who lost control over his car and slammed into a ditch in December feels when he starts...</span></a></div>
