			<p>I recognize I criticized <em><a href="http://www.sadlyno.com/">Sadly, No!</a> </em>rather harshly not but three days ago, so it may seem strange for me to trumpet this, but they've been putting yeoman's screws to Jonah Goldberg's insufferably stupid <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385511841/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning</em></a>.&nbsp; I'm normally not one to join the <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2007/12/19/the-goldberg-variations/">gagging</a> <a href="http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/2007/12/goldberg-swarth.html">chorus</a>, but this book demands mockery.&nbsp; I'm not sure where I should even begin, so why don't we begin where the book did:&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>I. Composition</strong></p>

<p>In October of 2005, Goldberg unashamedly used his <em>Corner</em> pulpit to <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NWUyZjk2YWFhNTUyYzhjNTM3ZGNmNzcxMzU5ZDc4Njg=">ask other people to do his research for him</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I'm working on a chapter of the book which requires me to read a lot about and by Herbert Spencer. There's simply no way I can read all of it, nor do I really need to. But if there are any real experts on Spencer out there—regardless of ideological affiliation—I'd love to ask you a few questions in case I'm missing something.</p></blockquote><p>Repeat after me: &quot;<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/more-listserv-e.html">Real scholars do their own research</a>.&nbsp; <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/09/what-they-see-w.html">Real scholars do their own research</a>.&quot;&nbsp; Since I was genuinely interested in what someone else had to say about Spencer, I responded to Goldberg's plea.&nbsp; (Why <em>not </em>aid a fellow Jew maintain the illusion of integrity?)&nbsp; He told me what he thought Spencer was up to.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I informed him (<em>politely</em>) he couldn't be more wrong.</p>

<p>He responded (<em>haughtily</em>) that other people said Spencer had said that.</p>

<p>I informed him (<em>politely</em>) those other people were wrong too.</p>

<p>He inquired (<em>brusquely</em>) why they wrote it then.</p>

<p>I said (<em>politely</em>) Spencer is the most misunderstood thinker of the 19th Century.</p>

<p>He told me (<em>angrily</em>) I hadn't helped him at all and not to write back.</p>

<p>So, without even having read the book, I can say with certainty that whatever it says about Herbert Spencer will not reflect anything Spencer himself wrote or believed.&nbsp; (For that you should <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0801445906/diesekoschmar-20">go here</a>.)&nbsp; I'll even go so far as imitate Spencer and draw a sweeping general conclusion from this particular incident:</p><blockquote><p>People should not write books about things they haven't read.&nbsp; (That's <a href="http://pervegalit.wordpress.com/2007/12/17/n1-speaks-the-truth/">what blogs are for</a>.)&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p><strong>II. Promotion</strong></p>

<p>Two years later, Goldberg <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGY3ODg1ZGEyYjQ0OTYxYzc0Yzc0ZDNhN2Q1MzhjMDE=">reversed tack</a>: instead of proclaiming his intellectual irresponsibility from the mount, he claimed <em>Liberal Fascism </em>would be &quot;a very serious, thoughtful, argument that has never been made&nbsp; in such detail or with such care.&quot;&nbsp; Given my experience with him, I must ask: </p>

<p><em>By whom </em>will this very serious, thoughtful, argument that has never been made in such detail or with such care be made?&nbsp; Certainly not by the person who rebuffed my attempt to inform him of what Spencer actually said.&nbsp; <em></em></p>

<p><em>That </em>guy clearly doesn't know from care or detail when it comes to research.&nbsp; <em></em></p>

<p><em>That</em> guy clearly has an agenda he won't let inconvenient truths upset.</p>

<p>Yet Goldberg would have us believe that these two guys are one and the same. </p>

<p>I say there is no universe in which the guy who begged scholars for misinformation is the same guy who will make a careful and detailed argument.&nbsp; (What with two objects not being able to occupy the same space at the same and all.)</p>

<p><strong>III. The Title</strong></p>

<p><em>Liberal Fascism</em>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Just because you put two words next to each other doesn't make them related.&nbsp; (This rule also applies to people.)&nbsp; </p>

<p>(Unless they're on an altar in the presence of some speech acts.)</p>

<p><strong>IV. The Sub-Title</strong></p>

<p><em>The Secret History of the American Left, from Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning.</em>&nbsp; </p>

<p>Mussolini?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Not American.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>V. The Text</strong></p>

<p>The folks at <em>Sadly, No! </em>have spent the better part of the week <a href="http://www.sadlyno.com/archives/8280.html">taking pictures of Goldberg's words</a>.&nbsp; These pictures demonstrate that Goldberg was unable to overcome his self-handicapping: for all the research he didn't do and all his protestations of care and detail, <em>Liberal Fascism </em>is a sublimely stupid book.&nbsp; Were a student to write such nonsense I'd vow <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/and_yet_i_still.html">to make them uncomfortable with my words and what I say</a>.&nbsp; <em>Liberal Fascism</em> is that stupid.&nbsp; To wit:</p>

<center><img src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/12/20/libfascism15.jpg" /></center>

<p>Where to begin?&nbsp; <em>YOU ARE A <a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/jonah081500.asp">BAD JEW</a> </em>.&nbsp; (Sorry.&nbsp; Just slipped out.)&nbsp; <em><br /></em></p>

<p><em>YOU ARE A BAD JEW.</em>&nbsp; (Don't know where this is coming from.&nbsp; I'll stop.) </p>

<p> <em>YOU ARE A ... A ... A ... PERSON WHO DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING.&nbsp; </em>(Better.) </p>

<p>Logic is one of the many things Goldberg does not know.&nbsp; Here is what he thinks it is:</p><blockquote><p>All X believe Y.</p>

<p>All Z believe Y.</p>

<p>Therefore all X are Z.</p></blockquote><p>I take it back: Goldberg <em>does</em> know logic.&nbsp; You can find the above syllogism in logic textbooks.&nbsp; Just turn to the section on <a href="http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/middle_fall.html">the fallacy of the undistributed middle</a> and there it is right there in your logic textbook.&nbsp; It is logic.&nbsp; Goldberg is wise to employ it:</p><blockquote><p>All [animal rights activists] believe [in animal rights].</p>

<p>All [Nazis] believe [in animal rights].</p>

<p>Therefore all [animal rights activists] are [Nazis].</p></blockquote><p>Logic is fun!&nbsp; I want to do more!</p><blockquote><p>All [liberals] believe [orgasms are fun].</p>

<p>All [Nazis] believe [orgasms are fun].</p>

<p>Therefore all [liberals] are [Nazis].</p></blockquote><p>You know what else is fun?&nbsp; Poetry!&nbsp; Poetry is fun!&nbsp; </p>

<p>You know what's even funner?&nbsp; Poetry about Goldberg!&nbsp; Poetry about Goldberg is even funner!&nbsp; Flippanter <a href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/comments_7962.html#721354">proves it</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Thirteen and a Half Ways of Looking at Jonah Goldberg</em></p>

<p>I.<br />
In the haunted thoughts of Jonah Goldberg<br />
The only hallowed thing<br />
Was the fear of the Clintons.</p>

<p>II.<br />
He was of two minds,<br />
Like an Enterprise<br />
On which there were two captains.</p>

<p>III.<br />
The Goldberg flailed at the keyboard,<br />
Pantomimed the smallness of his parts.</p>

<p>IV.<br />
A liberal and a fascist<br />
Are one.<br />
A liberal and a fascist<br />
And a schoolteacher are one.</p>

<p>V.<br />
I know which to prefer:<br />
The beauty of the war<br />
Is the beauty of Bush.<br />
You'd better agree now<br />
Or at least soon.</p>

<p>VI.<br />
Nachos filled his belly<br />
With barbaric gas.<br />
The shadow of the liberal<br />
And the liberal's girlfriend<br />
Ruined his mood.<br />
Stupid liberals<br />
And their exclusive parties.</p>

Just don&#39;t read it, or something, until you&#39;re drinking at MLA; I&#39;d guess some people there might be willing to try it out.  It is pretty funny that not only have the subjects of all of those verses actually happened (well, actually been blogged; we take it on trust that they&#39;ve actually happened), there were so many that I actually had to combine two and eliminate of couple of other more minor ones.</p>

<p>Maybe Goldberg is trying to drive everyone crazy just as the beloved Capt. Kirk did with computers.  &quot;Anything this stupid must be parodied.  Anything this stupid must be ignored.  Oh no, basic directive conflict -- abort, retry, fail!  Abort, retry, fail!&quot;</p></span>

		<span id="comment-94447970-content"><p>Scott, the thing you have to remember in dealing with characters like Jonah Goldberg (and included in this category is Michelle Malkin, Ann Althouse, and Patterico, from the previous thread) is that they literally, expressly do not care whether what they say is true or false. They don&#39;t think in terms of truth or falsity, but are instead minutely attuned to the success or failure of the rhetorical tactics in play. </p>

<p>You might be like, &quot;Sure, sure, I understand that,&quot; But I don&#39;t think you appreciate the lunar moral vacuum. When you say that they&#39;re acting in other than good faith, they <i>don&#39;t even understand what you mean</i>.   </p>

<p>And I actually like Patterico personally, by the way. There&#39;s no current grudge between us that I&#39;m aware of. </p></span>

<p>—Fernando Claudìn, <i>The Communist Movement: From Comintern to Cominform</i> (Penguin Books, 1975) </p>

<p>Is it dirty pool to point how much the New Right resembles the old Stalinist hegemony?</p>

<p>Thanks for your amusing response to Goldberg. I&#39;m glad to know that Goldberg evinced the precise degree of intellectual honesty I would have expected of him in that exchange.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-95718726-content"><p>I&#39;m interested in reading the book, having placed my Amazon pre-order back in April.  When I briefly talked to Jonah about it two years ago, he was somewhere in between Hayek and the professional political science literature, i.e., fascism as a movement of the left and fascism as an impossibly vague word that is more of an indication of disagreement than anything else.  The sub-title &quot;From Mussolini&quot; is important, because it&#39;s there that we can see the important problem of conflating Nazism with Fascism.  It&#39;s safe to say, even if some smart people will disagree with you, that Nazism is a kind of fascism, but that does not mean that Nazism is the sum total of what fascism means.  Mussolini and Hitler spent the war papering over their deep ideological disagreements.  I don&#39;t mean to give the impression that it&#39;s the last word on the subject, but I&#39;ve found Allardyce&#39;s &quot;What Fascism Is Not: Thoughts on the Deflation of a Concept&quot;, from The American Historical Review, Vol. 84, No. 2 (Apr., 1979), pp. 367-388, to be very informative.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-96368366-content"><p>Two quotes:</p>

<p>&quot;I have tried to be fair to the academic literature, though this is not an academic book.&quot;</p>

<p>And,</p>

<p>&quot;Herbert Spencer, the supposed founder of social Darwinism, was singled out as the poster boy for all that was wrong in classical liberalism.  Spencer was indeed a Darwinist--he coined the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;--but his interpretation of evolutionary theory reinforced his view that people should be left alone.  In almost every sense, Spencer was a good--albeit classical-- liberal: he championed charity, women&#39;s suffrage, and civil liberties.  But has was the incarnation of all that was backward, reactionary, and wrong according to the progressive worldview, not because he supported Hitlerian schemes of forced race hygiene but because he adamantly opposed them.  To this day it is de rigueur among liberal intellectual and historians to take potshots at Spencer as the philosophical wellspring of racism, right-wing &quot;greed,&quot; and even the Holocaust.&quot;</p></span>

		<span id="comment-97945210-content"><p>Assuming SEK has given a fair summary of his interactions with Jonah, we really have a landmark moment in the annals of chutzpah here.  In promoting his books, the message is &#39;Everything you thought you knew about fascism is wrong!  Free yourself from the tyranny of liberal academic groupthink!&#39;  But, inform him that he&#39;s wrong about Spencer and the response is &#39;You can&#39;t be serious: <i>everybody</i> knows Spencer believed such-and-such; it&#39;s an <i>Academically Acknowledged Fact</i>!&#39;</p>

Miriam had my back. The material'd been covered. We'd moved to the next chapter. Yet I had to read this tonight: Does anyone know if Marx wrote anything substantial on capital-qua-capital? (I'm not so concerned with his writing on money, although if something about it seems relevant to capital, I'd be happy to hear about that too.) If so, in what text might I find this? Thanks so much for extending your not inconsiderable expertise to suborn my project. I'll consider slapping your name in my acknowledgments page for fifteen seconds before deciding I'm a self-made man who never needed your help anyway. Thanks! All y'all who ask the obvious of experts, let me whisper some sweet somethings in your ear: Were I an evil telepathic narcissist, you'd think yourself the dynamite of my PROJECTED FUSE. Were I an angry giant robot, I'd evaporate your people with my devastating RAY STAR. Were I some folk who had tell of Internets, all my YAHOOS would ASK JEEVES who OGLED the cripplingly obvious answer to your question and we would laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh at your inability to locate the most basic of source material and the gall required to broadcast your shortcomings to everyone who knows you because it would be funny.</span></a></div>

I meant to send a quick note to the Little Womedievalist to the effect that she should spin her collection of inexplicable medieval marginalia into a blog of hilarious proportions ... but she shares the first letter of her Christian name with my advisor, and Outlook decided to send him the email I intended for her. I caught light of my mistake as I tabbed to and smacked &quot;Send.&quot; (What was it Saint Malkmus sang? &quot;Type Slowly&quot; [.mp3]? Maybe I should heed this shit.) By then it was too late. So thank you, Mr. Cohen, thank you for forcing me to send an email to my advisor explaining that I hadn't sent him the final draft of my first chapter, but a link to a picture of a medieval &quot;monkey butt trumpet.&quot; (I have no idea where the hyphen belongs there. It could just as easily be a &quot;monkey-butt trumpet&quot; as a &quot;monkey butt-trumpet.&quot;) I owe you one.</span></a></div>
