Since he's obsessed with inflating his hit count (because, as you well know, the more people who laugh at your blog, the more they esteem you), I encourage all my regular readers to peruse Bruce's accusations (including his devestatingly charming habit of refering to me as &quot;Scott Eric,&quot; as if it wasn't my name but constituted an insult) and tell them what they really think of me. Seriously. Unlike the Bruce, I have no illusions about my audience.

Anyhow, you can read his silly bloviation here. Feel free to inflate his hit count by demeaning me in every which way you can.

Update: Bruce has penned another &quot;anti-Scott Eric&quot; screed. He calls it &quot;Two Questions for Scott Eric.&quot; But he's banned me from commenting on it. You may be asking yourself: why would you directly ask someone questions then deny them the ability to answer them? Could it be that you fear my cold hard logic? (Because you should.

		<span id="comment-10025165-content"><p>According to John Bruce&#39;s own touchstone -- the dictionary -- a dangling participle only requires revision when the meaning of the sentence is unclear (the example, &quot;Looking to west, the river widens at it reaches the sea,&quot; is offered a perfectly acceptable sentence).  Given the context in which your cited sentence appears, I don&#39;t think revision was necessary.  As someone who corrects more dangling grammar than I care to admit, I can admit that it took me ten re-readings of the sentence to even *see* the dangling occuring.  Why?  Because your post on London made it clear from the start that it was London switching philosophies.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a word for those who think style is about rules and not clarity: bureaucrats.</p>

<p>Keep up the good work, and let John Bruce type his tales of middle-managers.  To paraphrase Capote on Kerouac, that&#39;s not writing, it&#39;s typing.</p>

<p>(Notice how JB won&#39;t take on someone like Berube -- the mocking he&#39;d bring on himself would be quite fun though.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-10035878-content"><p>As a non-sequitur:</p>

<p>Someone (me?) should write a satirical academic thriller called &quot;The Hiring Committee,&quot; where an extremely competitive and self-conscious graduate student does Whatever It Takes to get hired, only to discover that the particular job he wants is actually going to be given (an &quot;insider&quot; search) to an undercover FBI agent who is investigating a murder. </p>

<p>But it turns out the FBI agent is someone the protagonist dated in graduate school. She had dropped out and fallen off the radar. Unbeknownst to anyone, she started working undercover for the Agency. </p>

<p>While uncovering this mystery, our schlemiel anti-hero gets romantically involved with the chief suspect for the murder being investigated. (She -- the suspect -- happens to be the chair of the Hiring Committee)</p>

<p>What do you think? I&#39;m aiming for David Lodge meets John Grisham. </p>

<p>Oh, and John Bruce will be a character in the novel (not sure what his exact role will be yet; perhaps he will be a boorish blogger who runs a blog called <em>The Alley Gory</em>).</p></span>

<p>Amardeep, I&#39;d be there opening night, all three of my names in tow.  (I may even invent a fourth for the occasion.

<p>One thing that&#39;s been an eye-opener to me, as a middle-aged Southern English man with the repressive conditioning <i>always to be polite at all times, even to people who are smacking you in the head with a cricket bat</i> (&#39;I say would you mind <i>awfully</i> if I asked you to stop doing that ...?&#39;) is how r-u-d-e people can get when they&#39;re online.  Is it a &#39;I can&#39;t see your face therefore you don&#39;t register with my conscience <i>as</i> a human being&#39; type thing?  Or is it just that people are more fesity and aggressive over there in America?</p>

<p>Tolkien once claimed that he spoke &#39;the politeness dialect of the old Westron man&#39;, which if it could be purged of its reactionary ideological odour would be a wonderful language indeed to speak.</p></span>

On to the actual post: For the second time this week, I fulfill a promise to post about a given topic; namely, my courseblog. (Regular readers know what I'm talking about. Those drawn here by the carnival can read my initial musings here.) I've been meaning to talk about how this experiment proceeds, but life has intruded. Now that I'm living it at its proper remove again, I have time enough to say that courseblogging works. I'll discuss the benefits first, then share a few reservations. Class prepartation My old class preparation routine consisted of re-reading the essay I'd be teaching the next day and considering its place in the course. If I'd taught an article before, I'd look over my old notes to determine whether they're still germane. If they were, I reaquainted myself with them; if they weren't, I worked up new notes. Now I sit down, open my laptop, look over my notes and determine what aspect of the essay could benefit from careful dissection. For example, before teaching John McPhee's &quot;Atchafalaya&quot; on Monday, I spent Sunday morning piquing the students interest in his characteristically revealing metaphors. I did this despite knowing that I would spend the majority of Monday's class discussing his research methodology and structuring techniques. One blog post allowed me to accomplish two days worth of teaching in a single class period. It also relieved the pressure we all feel to cover everything in a single period. Of course, in addition to supplementing the assigned reading with extended discussion, I can also supplement the course itself with readings I didn't assign but think the students ought to read. In addition to the extensive list of resources scrolling down my sidebar, I've also posted emails from Pulitzer Prize-winning on the subject of foreshadowing and exceptional works of literary journalism published that week, like an excerpt from Joan Didion's latest book or her 2002 profile of Martha Stewart. (Lest you think the students don't read the supplementary material, here's a comment in which a student incorporates it into her argument.) The Actual Class Because I had analyzed McPhee's metaphors in a post they had already mulled over, I was able to discuss them with a much higher degree of sophistication. The responses from the students were correspondingly higher. Because we will be talking in more detail about literary journalists' special relationship with metaphorical writing, I didn't need to (nor did I) discuss McPhee's at great length. However, in today's class the students brought up Susan Orlean's metaphors in &quot;Lifelike&quot; and compared them to McPhee's in &quot;Atchafalaya.&quot; That means when I address the subject formerly in Week 5, the students will already have been processing the subject in a sophisticated manner for four weeks. The corresponding benefit is that when we have the formal discussion in Week 5, it will be far more informed by the reading they've already done than past classes have. Why? Because they've been processing the information...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/im_always_stumb.html"><span><strong>How to Open a Victorian Novel; or, The Greatest Opening Sentences That Never Were</strong> I'm always stumbling across sentences in the middle of paragraphs buried deep within chapters nestled in some sub-sub-section which, if I had my druthers, would instead find themselves the opening line of a classic Victorian novel. &quot;Why,&quot; I ask myself, &quot;would someone bury this perfectly serviceable first sentence of a Victorian novel in the middle of the middle of the middle of a book?&quot; I've often thought of keeping a notebook of such sentences, or at the very least, a running list of them on this humble blog. It could be a series easier to update than the failed &quot;A. Cephalous Word of the Every Other Day or So.&quot; (Which, I should add, I remind myself to update whenever I bump into words like &quot;calcate,&quot; which means &quot;to trample or stamp under heel.&quot; But while I'd love to show my shiny new word to the world, writing faux-usage histories seems so been-there-done-that I can't bring myself to go there and do it again.) But I digress. This sentence from the third chapter of Joan Didion's The Year of Magical Thinking should be opening some dusty Victorian tome: It was deep into the summer, some months after the night when I needed to be alone so that he could come back, before I recognized that through the winter and spring there had been occasions on which I was incapable of thinking rationally. Marvel at its potential. Looking at it now though, I wonder whether this particular example is more Victorian or postmodernly faux-Victorian. Because I think I may've read that Paul Auster novel. Back to the point: I'm going to start a collection of such sentences, and if you run across any feel free to deposit them in the comments section. I'm not entirely sure what I'm going to do with this collection, or what possible purpose it could serve humanity, but at the very least it could be a way to think more systematically about great opening lines without having to limit ourselves to idiosyncratically great opening lines. (As we did a few months back at Bérubé's place.) We'd limit ourselves to Victorian or postmodernly faux-Victorian novels instead.</span></a></div>
