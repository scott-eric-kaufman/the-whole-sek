        <meta name="description" content="The university's revamped the curriculum to emphasize the written word, so now I have to teach a traditional novel alongside my visual works. (Which I almost always did anyway but no matter.) I've decided to teach Game of Thrones, but there's one problem: I've decided to teach Game of Thrones. In a freshmen composition class. That's only ten weeks long. The quarter will look something like this: Week 1: Introduction to the genre. Watch Fellowship of the Ring. Read secondary material about fantasy. Weeks 2-5: Read Game of Thrones. Read secondary material about the novel. Write 4 blog posts and 1 short essay about it. Weeks 6-9: Watch Game of Thrones. Read secondary material about the series. Write 4 blog posts and 1 long essay about it. Week 10: Final project. You see the problem: the novel's 675 pages long, meaning that from Week 2 until Week 5 they'll be reading 169 pages of the novel and approximately 15 pages of secondary material per week. Experience suggests that having freshmen non-majors read 184 pages per week while also asking them to produce 10 of their own pages may be too much for them to handle. So here's my bold (or blasphemous) plan: I let them skip the Daenerys chapters (3, 11, 23, 36, 46, 54, 61, 64, 68, and 72). Because I read the novel on a Kindle, I'm not exactly sure how many pages that will save them. But it makes narrative sense: they'll spend all their time on the island of Westeros and we'll spend all our classtime discussing its affairs in Weeks 2-5. When we shift to the series in Week 6, we'll focus our attention on Daenerys and the events happening on Essos. That means the majority of the visual rhetorical analysis will involve horses, but it could be worse. Another idea, floated by Gerry Canavan, would be to force the students to read one chapter from each of the point-of-view characters and allow them to decide which two they wanted to ignore. They'd have to justify their decision via a rhetorical analysis in a blog post, meaning that they would write that the Daenerys chapters don't provide them with significant information about the context of conversations within the novel, or that they don't believe they're receiving accurate information from Tyrion because of his ethos. I like that from a pedagogical point of view, but I'm not sure about the classroom mechanics. Take a vote and ignore the two characters with the fewest proponents? I don't know. Any other suggestions are welcome." />

			<p>The university&#39;s revamped the curriculum to emphasize the written word, so now I have to teach a traditional novel alongside my visual works. (Which I almost always did anyway but no matter.) I&#39;ve decided to teach <a href="www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553386794/diesekoschmar-20" target="_self"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, but there&#39;s one problem: I&#39;ve decided to teach <em>Game of Thrones</em>. In a freshmen composition class. That&#39;s only ten weeks long. The quarter will look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Week 1: </strong>Introduction to the genre. Watch <a href="www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000YMKBWG/diesekoschmar-20" target="_self"><em>Fellowship of the Ring</em></a>. Read secondary material about fantasy.</li>
<li><strong>Weeks 2-5: </strong>Read&#0160;<a href="www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553386794/diesekoschmar-20" target="_self"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a><em>.</em> Read secondary material about the novel. Write 4 blog posts and 1 short essay about it.</li>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c317d2346970b-content"><p>Scott, the last time I watched Jackson&#39;s movies, I felt that they looked like shitty &#39;80&#39;s action films, and it disgusted me. I remember how I felt after I saw Fellowship, and I walked right out of Two Towers it was so horrible. The bits and pieces of Return of the King that I&#39;ve seen were just...offensive.</p>

<p>So, when I see that you&#39;re using Fellowship in your class, I absolutely have to ask you for a visual rhetoric post on it. How, how, how can you be showing that to impressionable young freshmen? The dialogue is infantile, and the framing of the shots is straight out of, I don&#39;t know, a Van Damme movie. The movies are one big practical joke on society. </p>

<p>I am seriously requesting you do a post on LotR, becase, honestly, in ten years, no one - not a single person - has ever given me a single argument as to why they are decent movies, let alone &quot;best of the year and/or decade.&quot; I absolutely need to see your critiques of these movies, because I am absolutely shocked that you would use them in your class. </p></span>

There&#39;s a lot to be said about Jackson reverting to his pre-<em>Heavenly Creatures</em> love of horror clichés, and have no fears, I&#39;ll say it.</p></span>

I mean, you can call my taste in movies bad or whatever, but that&#39;s not an argument for the movie&#39;s quality, it&#39;s just a dig at my taste. </p>

<p>To be clear, I mainly take issue with Jackson&#39;s childish interpretation of the plot and the terrible way he handled the characters. He could have simplified the story by actually telling the important parts of the story instead of wasting time with all his little dick and fart jokes. &quot;No one tosses a dwarf.&quot; Just...huh? Where did that even come from? Was this supposed to be a children&#39;s movie or something? </p>

<p>But when I rewatched it, I also noticed that it is shot like a cheesy action movie, and that&#39;s something that SEK specializes in explaining, and I absolutely understand that I could be wrong about that, which is why I want to see SEK&#39;s post on it.</p></span>

<p>I don&#39;t call your taste in movies bad, not at all. But it clearly is idiosyncratic (at least in this case)--these movies were not only loved by audiences but also critically acclaimed, which doesn&#39;t make you wrong but does make it weird that you would be so shocked that someone would teach them in a class.</p>

<p>I rank the movies more highly than you or Ahist do. I don&#39;t have enough of a sense of film history or composition to tell the difference between the movie being shot like a &quot;cheesy action movie&quot; and a regular action movie, though, so I too am interested in Scott&#39;s (and your) thoughts on that.</p></span>

<p>But, yeah, I&#39;m not shocked as much as, you know, I trust SEK&#39;s word on movies, and he&#39;s teaching something that I&#39;ve never understood. So now&#39;s a chance for me to hear a real professional tell me why the movies are good. </p>

<p>I mean, most reviewers have really faint praise for these movies. At least when SEK criticizes a movie, he&#39;ll still tell us why it LOOKS good, even if it&#39;s otherwise crap. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c317fea97970b-content"><p>I dunno about the individualized route. Opting out of (e.g.) Ned&#39;s POV would mean missing some pretty damn important elements of the narrative; skipping Jon&#39;s would save them a lot of work, but would also mean losing some of the more interesting sociological details of family and xenophobia. You could easily find yourself spending four weeks teaching a dozen <i>different</i> novels with separate (if overlapping) themes, plots, and characters. That seems... excessively difficult.</p>

<p>Cutting out the Danaerys POV seems like the most straightforward plan, since (IIRC; it&#39;s been a while) she doesn&#39;t really collide with the rest of the POV characters until halfway through the second volume. But in that case I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s a better idea to complement the missing material or maintain your focus on events in Westeros; on balance, and given the typical undergraduate attention span, I&#39;d probably take the latter.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3185bfab970b-content"><p>Robert M. has some good points; the different POV&#39;s form a tapestry, and I think if you let students choose which POV&#39;s to follow, you&#39;d probably end up doing so much backfilling in order to connect thematic dots that it becomes confusing, or tedious, or both. At least with Danaerys&#39; POV, her part of the tapestry takes more time to link up with the rest. You <i>could</i> help smooth out that pothole by providing a kind of outline for what&#39;s going on in those chapters, just so the students could see how a theme developed in one section is addressed in another section they&#39;re not reading. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this happens in GoT, but later on, it becomes more difficult to leave out certain POV chapters. The whole Bastard of Bolton storyline is in part conveyed through partially-heard conversations by small folk and relatively minor characters across a few different chapters. It seemed like GRRM was telling the reader not to ignore the little things.</p>

<p>What kind of secondary material are you bringing in? About a year ago, I saw some debates about how Romanticism influences contemporary fantasy; how fascism took many of its aesthetic cues from Romanticism, and thus if contemporary fantasy then contains -- mainly unconsciously -- a kernel of what motivates fascist ideology; and if A Song of Ice and Fire reiterated or resisted those aesthetic moves. Interesting discussion material.</p></span>

Since when do Republicans pay attention to climate models?</strong> Everyone knows that predicting the future is incredibly easy, whereas explaining the past is incredibly difficult. For example, in 1933 everyone in the entire world could foresee that Hitler's rise to power would lead directly to the Final Solution, whereas today, it's impossible to prove that the Holocaust even happened. Similarly, today everyone in the Republican Party can look at the meteorological maps and foresee that delaying the convention by a day is a prudent idea, whereas a decade hence, they won't even be able to prove that a &quot;Hurricane Isaac&quot; delayed their trip to &quot;Tampa Bay&quot; to nominate something called a &quot;Mitt Romney&quot; to represent their &quot;Party&quot; in the &quot;White House.&quot; It'll be called &quot;Convention Theory&quot; and will, of course, merely be a &quot;theory.&quot; Just like global warming and the Holocaust. If ever there were a time to slam conservatives for their selective belief systems, it is now. If they truly don't believe in that scientists can accurately account for climatological events, we should hold their feet to the fire and demand mandatory attendance for all planned speakers. Doesn't matter if Jindal wants to stay in Louisiana, because by the standards he otherwise champions there's no proof that Hurricane Isaac will hit New Orleans. It's only a &quot;theory.&quot; If Isaac does hit New Orleans, it won't mean anything other than weather. Pat Robertson won't go on national television and declare that Isaac's landing is God's Punishment. The optics of Republicans partying at their convention while New Orleans drowns again won't be indicative of the Party's disregard for Americans who are poor or black, it'll be a creation of the liberal media intended to make the Republicans look callous. &quot;We'd planned this convention for months and removing Obama from office is paramount to the plight of an already drowned city,&quot; not a single one of them will say. But some conservative bloggers will note -- as they did during Katrina -- that New Orleans deserves its death because it's low-lying and within a common hurricane track, and they'll base their conviction on solid evidence, by which they'll mean the same geological record and climate modeling that relegates global warming to the status of &quot;theory.&quot; Just like the Holocaust.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/08/breaking-bad-say-my-name.html"><span><strong>Breaking Bad: &quot;Say My Name,&quot; or fine, maybe don't even acknowledge I exist.</strong> One of the more gratifying things about studying film and television is the occasional payoff. You consider a scene in obsessive detail and it turns out that scene is just as important as you thought it was. This isn't a credit to you, obviously, so much as the director. (Though it is a validation that you're not imparting significance to irrelevant details.) So watching the latest episode of Breaking Bad, &quot;Say My Name,&quot; was particularly gratifying for yours truly because it indicated that I didn't waste a day last week breaking down that scene at the dinner table in &quot;Buyout.&quot; It had a punchline. Recall the establishing shot from that episode: Compare that to the establishing shot in &quot;Say My Name&quot;: They're nearly identical. Nearly. As I tell my students: shots in which the differences are slight matter more than shots in which the differences are grand. So this long shot is a little longer—the head of the couch in the living room is visible—but the composition is identical, albeit less tightly framed. What does the looser framing suggest? Given the off-center position of the couch-head, the implication is that whatever orderly detente had been reached in the previous episode has, literally, been cast askew. Evidence of the tipped kilter abounds: two of the chairs occupied in &quot;Buyout&quot; are empty, and one of the characters—Jesse in his role as a figure of a son—has been replaced by a bottle of wine. It's almost as if the director, Thomas Schnauz, is claiming that if Jesse prevented Skyler and Walter from having a conversation in &quot;Buyout,&quot; in &quot;Say My Name&quot; it's the wine. (And that Skyler's deliberately putting the wine between them. It had occupied the majority of her attention the last time after all.) Point being: Schnauz wants viewers to employ their Highlights for Kids-cultivated ability to discern what's different about these establishing shots. He's inviting the comparison, and there are many to be made. In &quot;Buyout,&quot; for example, the &quot;family&quot; sat down to a freshly cooked dinner from Albertson's. It's not quite home-cooking, but it's not entirely processed either. In &quot;Say My Name,&quot; Skyler has sat down with a bottle of wine and a TV dinner. She didn't even bother to buy the freshly prepackaged meal, meaning she cares one degree-of-freshness less in this episode than she did in the last. And not just about herself: She's &quot;prepared&quot; a microwave dinner for Walter as well, if by &quot;prepare&quot; one means &quot;purchased and deposited in the freezer.&quot; The implication in &quot;Buyout&quot; was that she'd plated the food she'd bought at Albertson's—hence Jesse's confusion about it being home-cooked—whereas in &quot;Say My Name&quot; Walter's clearly had to microwave his own highly processed dinner. Moreover, whereas in the previous episode some modicum of social graces kept Skyler at the table long enough to listen to Jesse blather on about the green beans, in this episode as soon as Walter starts talking about Jesse's replacement, Skyler just leaves: And note that she takes the long...</span></a></div>
