	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/02/this_will_have_.html"><span><strong>This Will Have Been the Best Post Ever</strong> It opened with an anecdote you found charming and shared with the first person you saw. She thought it wonderful too, and wrote about it on her blog. A few nights later, over drinks, you argued about its intent. You were both off the mark and fought anyway. In the end, you each found the other's misinterpretation meaningful. Reconciled, you promised to get drinks again soon. Later that night, you continued reading. In the next sentence, the anecdote had been contextualized. You found it meaningful in a way you were too tired to think about. You left the tab open intending to return to it, but started browsing around your favorite guilty pleasures instead. You learned who that breathtaking Hollywood star was reputed to have slept with and in what shoes. Arriving at a page in which fifty-four Flash ads blared their wares in bitter discord, you closed your browser before it crashed. It crashed anyway. You thought about the phrase &quot;bitter discord&quot; and realized that it and the like are why people sometimes find you pretentious. You restarted the computer and reopened your browser. Your eyes lit upon the anecdote again and you nodded your head at its context. What followed surprised you with a shock of ribald humor. You couldn't believe this post said that. You turned away, embarrassed, afraid that someone might have seen what you had read. But no one had. You enjoyed its bawdy humor and praised the admirable daring or egregious stupidity of its author. Whether it was daring or stupidity was an internal debate you shelved for later that afternoon, when that dullard would drone at you and life would grind to a standstill. So you continued reading and were impressed by a brilliant interpretation of an abstruse work. This sentence was particularly wonderful, but you stared at it too long and its brilliance shattered under the scrutiny. As the idiot shards rained down you ran for cover. But your familiar online environs were tainted by the experience. You decided never to read another post here again, and yet, here you are, reading a post here again. You wonder what is wrong with you for a few minutes before remembering the answer.</span></a></div>
