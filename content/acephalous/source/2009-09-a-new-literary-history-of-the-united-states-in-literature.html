        <meta name="description" content="The publication of A New Literary History of the United States will likely strike a few chords familiar to the participants in the debate that followed Rohan’s latest post. Written neither in the Emory Elliot mode—a history of items both literary and American—nor that of Sacvan Bercovitch—a history all items written by Americans that can be yours for the low, low price of $299.29—editors Greil Marcus and Werner Sollors instead decided to write a cultural history of the United States in a self-consciously literary voice. As Laura Miller at Salon* writes, the two have pitched the biggest tent conceivable, pegging each of the chronologically arranged essays in the book to “points in time and imagination where something changed: when a new idea or a new form came into being, when new questions were raised, when what before seemed impossible came to seem necessary or inevitable.” With this in mind, they’ve produced a compendium that is neither reference nor criticism, neither history nor treatise, but a genre-defying, transcendent fusion of them all. It sounds impossible, but the result seems both inevitable and necessary and profoundly welcome, too. This is, then, an anthology seemingly written to drive J.C. Hallman to drink, because it doggedly focuses on cultural significance over the literariness of the literary. However soul-deadening he might consider its subject matter, the manner in which most of it is written would likely meet with approval. Though idea-driven, the prose in Jonathan Lethem’s entry on Thomas Edison—in which he exclusively discusses the inventor’s place in film history—still sings: To watch the Edison films now, and those of the other production companies that joined him in the earliest phase of the film industry, is to discover a portal peering both backward and forward in cultural time. Even the most assiduous film buffs tend to begin with Charlie Chaplin, who appeared as a performer and made his first pictures as a fledgling director in 1914, or D. W. Griffith’s Birth of a Nation a year later. But the films that preceded those are as revelatory for their familiarity as their strangeness. Almost none presents a possibility that will fail to be exfoliated in the great boom to come, nor explores an avenue that runs anywhere but straight from the common cultural trove. A 120-second costumed Punch and Judy show like The Clown and the Alchemist (Edison Company, 1900), with its antic clown assisted in his abuses of the sententious alchemist by the use of stop-motion special effects, forms a lucid bridge between vaudeville and a Jim Carrey movie—The Mask, say. And watching the Selig Polyscope Company’s thirteen-minute 1910 version of The Wizard of Oz provides an uncanny sense of dislocation. Presenting a series of highlight moments derived from the popular stage version (adapted by L. Frank Baum, the novel’s author), the Selig Oz, in scenes of the Tin Man’s oiling, of the tale’s companions skipping arm in arm down a yellow brick road, and of the Wizard’s departure by balloon, seems a precognitive appropriation..." />

<blockquote><p>To watch the Edison films now, and those of the other
production companies that joined him in the earliest phase of the film
industry, is to discover a portal peering both backward and forward in
cultural time. Even the most assiduous film buffs tend to begin with
Charlie Chaplin, who appeared as a performer and made his first
pictures as a fledgling director in 1914, or D. W. Griffith’s <em>Birth of a Nation</em>
a year later. But the films that preceded those are as revelatory for
their familiarity as their strangeness. Almost none presents a
possibility that will fail to be exfoliated in the great boom to come,
nor explores an avenue that runs anywhere but straight from the common
cultural trove. A 120-second costumed Punch and Judy show like <em>The Clown and the Alchemist</em>
(Edison Company, 1900), with its antic clown assisted in his abuses of
the sententious alchemist by the use of stop-motion special effects,
forms a lucid bridge between vaudeville and a Jim Carrey movie—<em>The Mask</em>, say. And watching the Selig Polyscope Company’s thirteen-minute 1910 version of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>
provides an uncanny sense of dislocation. Presenting a series of
highlight moments derived from the popular stage version (adapted by L.
Frank Baum, the novel’s author), the Selig <em>Oz</em>, in scenes of
the Tin Man’s oiling, of the tale’s companions skipping arm in arm down
a yellow brick road, and of the Wizard’s departure by balloon, seems a
precognitive appropriation of gestures that would otherwise appear to
wholly belong to Judy Garland and her 1939 compatriots. The viewer may
be convinced that the medium’s real genius was for stopping American
time, and for opening an interior eye on a cultural unconscious always
rehearsing the same few dreams.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Mostly sings—sings more than academic prose normally does.&#0160; Marcus’s entry <a href="http://www.newliteraryhistory.com/mobydick.html">on <em>Moby Dick</em></a> and Gish Jen’s <a href="http://www.newliteraryhistory.com/catcherintherye.html">on <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em></a> both do justice to their subjects in under 2,000 words, and <em>by God</em>, <em>man</em>, when someone edits <a href="http://www.newliteraryhistory.com/tennesseewilliams.html">Camille Paglia</a>,
she almost resembles the scholar she once was.&#0160; That said, sustaining
my enthusiasm for this sort of literary reevaluation of American
history becomes difficult when I remember how quickly such endeavors
seem dated.&#0160; For example, one hundred years ago next year, Edwin
Markham published a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=aa89AAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22the+real+america+in+romance%22&amp;output=text&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s">similarly self-conscious literary history of the United States</a>, only then the regnant literary mode—in the <em>literarily</em> literary sense—was the historical romance, so the result sounded something like this:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Is it true that there is nothing new under the sun? Is
not aerial navigation a new method of transportation? wireless
telegraphy a new means of communication? Is not the plan of teaching
authentic history through the medium of romance not only a new
educational method, but a long step in advance of any hitherto
employed?
</p>
<p>History is laden with romance: why withhold it? No land is richer in
material for song and story than our New World; its discovery is a tale
of faerie, its discoverer a hero of enchantment. And—what is even more
to the purpose—where is there a romantic character so satisfactorily
interesting, where a creation of the imagination so humanly
serviceable, as here? What finer inspiration can a boy have to lead him
into manhood and uplift him through the long years of after life than
that which glows in the career of this dreamer of a Dream?
</p>
<p>It is not the purpose here to tell a new story: it has been told
again and again, and the truth winnowed out from the chaff of
unscrupulous biographers. But stress has been laid upon facts too
commonly neglected, and characters lightly estimated have been given
proper emphasis . . . </p>
<p>
Here we may learn anew that while conservatism is necessary to hold
what has been attained in our civilization, it is not from this that
advancement comes; rather is it from the idealist, the man too little
esteemed by those enthroned, that the impetus is gained which opens the
way, not to one, but to many a new world . . .
</p>
<p>That every care has been taken to maintain the highest standard of
accuracy in historical dates, places, characters, and happenings, and
to prevent confusion of romantic episode and historic event, need not
be said: the tale which follows bears upon its face its own proof.
</p>
<p>To the reader is left the pleasant duty of entering upon
acquaintance, even to the point of intimacy, with a fellow-man, a
fellow-American whose greatness was not for his own time or nation, but
for all time and all mankind. Even as he is to bespeak your admiration
for his marvelous, his unparalleled, achievement, so is he to make
demands upon your tenderest sympathies for the troubles that beset him
and the woes which encompassed him roundabout.</p></blockquote>
<p>
I’m not saying this new anthology will sound equally dated a century from now, but I’m not saying it won’t, either.

*I don’t know why all the entries Laura Miller mentioned in her review
are available online, but given that Marcus and Paglia also write for <em>Salon</em>, it’s more likely a matter of behind-the-scenes cooperation than those-are-the-only-ones-Miller-read. </p><p>(<em><a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/a_new_literary_history_of_the_united_states_in_literature/">x-posted</a></em>.)</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5963371970b-content"><p>I dunno.  While the style of Markham&#39;s writing has that old-school Progressive Era charm to it, I find the substance entirely in keeping with current concerns.  The historical novel remains the dominant middle-to-high literary form in American writing, and romance as a mode of historiography is the dominant mode.  I found it rather prophetic, actually.</p>

<p>In any case, this Marcus/Sollors collection -- beyond the thrill that this book was assembled by these two wonderful writers and scholars -- totally excited me.  My only concern is that they included Obama as an entry, and that immediately dates it.  The idea that the Obama presidency is the start of something new (which is the unifying thread throughout the entries) is short-sighted and, so far, palpably untrue.  If anything, Dubya ran an entirely new form of presidency.  Obama is trying, and failing, to run some bastard child of Kennedy&#39;s and FDR&#39;s regimes.</p></span>

Color me impressed.</strong> It may have taken awhile, but thanks to Patrick Courrielche’s exposé at, of all places, Big Hollywood, conservatives are positively fuming over the Bush Administration‘s decision to funnel $2.2 billion through the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives into programs that specifically support the President’s ideological and policy commitments, like the Abstinence Education Program, designed to “enable states to provide abstinence education and mentoring, counseling, and adult supervision to promote abstinence from sexual activity.” Conservatives are rightly upset with a speech Bush delivered at the 2004 White House National Conference on Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, in which he said “[i]t’s hard to be a faith-based program if you can’t practice faith [and] the message to you is, we’re changing the culture here in America.” “It’s hard to read his comments as anything but a call for groups to engage in a partisan campaign on behalf of the Bush Administration’s policy agenda,” argued John Hinderaker. Nick Gillespie agreed, saying that “[i]f you’ve ever wondered—and worried—about where government support of the arts leads, look no further than the full transcript of an August 10, 2009 telecon[ference call] between an official at the National Endowment for the Arts and a group of ‘independent artists from around the country.’” Wait wait wait—I thought conservatives were upset because the White House created an office, installed it five federal agencies, then used them to fund a clearly partisan policy agenda to the tune of $2.2 billion. You mean to tell me all those links are about an August 10th conference call that tried to wrangle up support for the current President’s National Day of Service—a call in which not one cent of the NEA’s $155 million budget was dispensed or even offered? They are. All the outrage centers around a conference call designed, in the words soon-to-be-becked* Yosi Sergant, “to raise the visibility” for a program whose purpose is to encourage “all Americans and others throughout the world to voluntarily perform at least one good deed or another service activity on the anniversary of 9/11 each year, and on other days marked by terrorist events.” The problem, it seems, is that the NEA is supposed to be above partisanship, and supporting the President’s United We Serve initiative is seen by conservatives to be a partisan issue. Here are some of its highly partisan goals: We want to make Americans’ lives better by asking everybody to participate in shaping the life of their community and make the quality of life better. Clearly, “making Americans’ lives better” is a partisan issue. Which would be acceptable, were the administration not being so heavy-handed: [H]ow do we move the people who look to each of you for guidance to get involved? We have to leave that to you because nobody else knows how to do it better than you do[.] Clearly, dictating that individual organizations ought to do what they think is appropriate in a manner of their own choosing is but one step from installing Obama as...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/turns-out-i-owe-jack-cashill-an-apology.html"><span><strong>Turns out I owe Jack Cashill an apology.</strong> Because I was wrong, wrong, wrong about the identity of the author of Dreams From My Father. Independent confirmation of Cashill's claim that William Ayers penned the President's memoir comes in the form of a book by celebrity biographer Christopher Andersen. Cashill is right to be excited—it's not every day you blunder to the plate, close your eyes, swing for the fences and have your prayers answered. That's what the arrival of corroborating evidence in Andersen's book amounts to, and no researcher who's found corroboration of the sort in independently researched materials will begrudge Cashill the tone of unreserved glee and grammatical abandon evident in his latest post: In his new book, &quot;Barack and Michelle: Portrait of an American Marriage,&quot; Best-selling celebrity journalist, Christopher Andersen, has blown a huge hole in the Obama genius myth without intending to do so. Who cares that book titles are traditionally underlined or italicized, capital letters belong at the beginning of sentences, or that he uses, commas, like an undergraduate when independent research has provided a factual basis for his speculative argument: Relying on inside sources, quite possibly Michelle Obama herself, Andersen describes how Dreams came to be published—just as I had envisioned it in my articles on the authorship of Dreams. With the deadline pressing, Michelle recommended that Barack seek advice from &quot;his friend and Hyde Park neighbor Bill Ayers.&quot; Only a killjoy would complain that Michelle Obama couldn't be a source, &quot;quite possibly&quot; or otherwise, because Andersen wrote an unauthorized biography—which, by definition, is a biography whose subject or subjects did not participate in its composition. That those &quot;inside sources&quot; who knew of Michelle's purported recommendation are not named, i.e. sourced, is the sort of thing that, despite being true, only someone who hated joy would point out. Andersen continues, &quot;In the end, Ayers's contribution to Barack's Dreams From My Father would be significant—so much so that the book's language, oddly specific references, literary devices, and themes would bear a jarring similarity to Ayers's own writing.&quot; Even though Cashill jettisons the very pretense of formatting book titles here, and even though Andersen's claim is couched in a conditional clause (&quot;would be significant&quot;) of the sort favored by authors who learned their libel law from the wrong end of many lawsuits, we should not let such quibbles diminish the importance of this independent, corroborating evidence—especially when, even though Cashill doesn't identify him in his post, these claims come from a named source: In the end, Ayers's contribution of Barack's Dreams from My Father would be significant—so much so that the book's language, oddly specific references, literary devices, and themes would bear a jarring similiarity to Ayers's own writings . . . &quot;There was a good deal of literary back-scratching going on in Hyde Park,&quot; said writer Jack Cashill, who noted that a mutual friend of Barack and Ayers, Rashid Khalidi, thanked Ayers for helping him with his book Resurrecting Empire. Ayers, explained Cashill, &quot;provided an informal editing service for like-minded friends in the...</span></a></div>
