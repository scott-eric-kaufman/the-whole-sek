political equivalent of an atomic wedgie: overt propaganda. Attacking
the National Endowment for the Arts comes straight from the &#39;90s
script: every dollar the NEA disburses will be tracked by the likes of <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/">Andrew Breitbart</a> until <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0884540464/diesekoschmar-20">the perfect moment</a> to introduce the world to the next &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piss_Christ">Piss Christ</a>&quot; arrives. They&#39;ve already begun to remind the troops of <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/ggraham/2009/09/28/art-is-stuff-and-stuff-happens/">all the old tropes</a>,
but their attempt to preemptively undermine the institutional
credibility of the NEA indicates that this generation of conservative
critics might be more media savvy than their &#39;90s counterparts. Tim
Slagle&#39;s <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/tslagle/2009/09/25/will-ferrell-and-co-answer-the-nea-call-shill-for-obamacare/">response</a> to a recent <a href="http://pol.moveon.org/insurance_execs/?rc=homepage">MoveOn campaign</a> is a sign of smears to come:</p><blockquote>It looks like the NEA’s call for artists to promote health care initiatives has been heard by some comedy artists.</blockquote>

<p>MoveOn

artists—whether they shoot a crucifix in urine like Andrew Serrano or
urinate on themselves like Will Ferrell—will be seen as complicit in a
conspiracy to undermine America so grand even Goebbels would blush.</p>

<p>But
while they may be savvy, they&#39;re far from smart. In the article quoted
above, Slagle offers a &quot;prize to anyone who can name all eight [actors
in the MoveOn video] without using Google,&quot; includes the name of all of
them in his tags not once, <em>but twice</em>, and his commenters are still stumped. And <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/how-to-be-an-as.html">the one</a> <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/whos-tribunaling-whose-what-to-whom-here.html">and odious</a> John Ziegler calls for a return to &quot;the Golden Age of television (the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s),&quot; when Americans came together <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jziegler/2009/09/28/why-were-the-emmys-not-racist/">to laugh at black people for the wrong reasons</a>, before he realized—or was told—that he should be laughing <em>at</em> Archie Bunker, not <em>with</em> him.</p>

<p>That his list of programs excludes <em>The Cosby Show</em> is no surprise. He prefers <em>Sanford and Sons</em> because its humor was a function of its characters&#39; blackness, whereas the comedy on <em>Cosby</em>
was situational, and Ziegler found its situations implausible. How
could a black obstetrician treat white women without race becoming an
issue? The specter of miscegenation may not, I confess, be responsible
for him preferring Golden Age shows with majority black casts, but his
vision of American unity is undeniably odd:</p><blockquote>The major
networks used to create a de facto “team photo” of our nation which
(after a slow start) eventually included everyone in the picture. Now,
each race, gender, and age group has their own “team” and tends to
watch programming that is built to only appeal to them. In short, we
end up living in very different realities with almost nothing in
common[.]</blockquote>

<p>So in the Golden Age, when Norman Lear was adapting the BBC sitcoms <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Till_Death_Us_Do_Part_%28British_TV_series%29">Till Death Us Do Part</a></em> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steptoe_and_Son"><em>Steptoe and Son</em></a>
for American audiences, television became &quot;a de facto &#39;team photo&#39; of
our nation [that] included everyone in the picture.&quot; First, white and
black do not a photograph of America make; second, in Ziegler&#39;s
photograph there are shows with majority white casts and shows with
majority black casts, but none, like <em>Cosby</em>, with what could be called <em>integrated casts</em>.
Ziegler further complains that his inability to find Tyler Perry funny
represents &quot;a net loss to the strength of the fabric of our country,&quot;
because once upon a time he could laugh at the scheming of Fred
Sanford, but now that black people have shows built to &quot;appeal to
them,&quot; they appear to be &quot;living in very different realities with
almost nothing in common.&quot;</p>

<p>He seems not to realize that <em>they did then and do now</em>.
A commenter who named himself after Dane Cook does his damnedest to
embody the plain racist underpinning of Ziegler&#39;s argument:</p> <blockquote>For
the most part, blacks on television have assimilated into the
mainstream of society and no one thinks much about it any more.</blockquote>

<p>The mainstream of society . . . they assimilated into the mainstream of society . . . now what would that be again?</p>

But there semed to be an underlying assertion along those lines that I percieved throughout your essay.  Perhaps it was more related to what you said more directly in your comment, that racism is a stuctural element of the culture wars.</p>

<p>I disagree with that too, and believe that it is no more an element of the culture wars than class, age, provinciality, and closed-mindedness are.</p>

<p>I think that the whole culture wars concept is one of perception though.  As many folks that feel somehow that women and minorities are culturally put upon, there are an almost equal number that feel our nation has become one of minority exceptionalism and the celebration of mediocrity-all in the name of a stilted &quot;diversity&quot; that is forcibly superimposed regardless of setting.  Neither extremem would have been what Dr. King was referring to when he spoke of a color blind society.</p></span>

You misunderstand my sentance, the majority of the public is not opposed to the NEA, but is opposed to the health care legislation that the White House and the Democratic leadership in congress is proposing.</p>

<p><a href="http://tiny.cc/1pEmK" rel="nofollow">http://tiny.cc/1pEmK</a></p>

<p>And I don&#39;t know if Scaife is behind &quot;Reason&quot; magazine, but I&#39;ll take your word for it.  It doesn&#39;t matter really though, because no public funds are going towards advancing his ideological agenda, which is the point I was making about Soros funding pro-Obama agenda art instead of the NEA.</p>

<p>Finally Karl, there are many on the left side of the political spectrum that decry the opposition to Obama&#39;s agenda as being revealing of racism, conscious or otherwise.  The list is too long for me to make a complete one, but let&#39;s start with Jimmy Carter, Howard Kurtz, Joe Klein, Maxine Waters to name but a few.  And while I never said that there are no racists who oppose Obama soley for his appearance, these are a minority-and nonexistent in the circles I run in, so to speak...<br />

But as I like this definition by Tom better than mine, I'm running with it instead: Since SEK eventually writes at any given blog I happen to read,* if I start reading, say, The Corner on a regular basis, it is inevitable that one day SEK will be blogging there. Which means that we can—simply by reading conservative blogs—turn the entire wingnut blogosphere in a bastion of literary criticism interested in Darwinian rhetoric, comic books, and dismantling incredibly dumb arguments made by those very same conservatives. Go, Scott, go! *What I will now call SEK'S Law, a variation on Godwin's Law: &quot;As a blog's lifespan grows longer, the probability of SEK becoming a regular contributor approaches 1.&quot;</span></a></div>

How could there not be? Andersen &quot;interviewed some 200 people for the book,&quot; which is a whole lot. Here is a list of them drawn from the back matter and organized by chapters: Chapters 1 and 2 Janet Allison Maxine Box Clive Gray Joyce Feuer Leslie Hairston Lowell Jacobs Keith Kakugawa Eric Kusunoki Julie Lauster Alan Lum Chris McLachlin Abner Mikva Newton Minow Toni Preckwinkle Vinai Thummalapally Carolyn Trani Pake Zane Chapters 3 and 4 Loretta Augustin-Herron Bradford Berenson Cheryl Johnson Hazel Johnson Jerry Kellman Mike Kruglik Yvonne Lloyd Alvin Love Abner Mikva* Judson Miner Newton Minow* Linda Randle Vinai Thummalapally* Laurence Tribe Chapters 5 to 8 Janet Allison* Letitia Baldrige Mary Ann Campbell Joyce Feuer* Leslie Hairston* Tom Harkin Coralee Jacobs Denny Jacobs Lowell Jacobs Mike Jacobs John Kerry Edward Koch Rick Lazio Alan Love* Abner Mikva* Judson Miner* Newton Minow* Jeremiah Posedel Toni Preckwinkle* Betsy Vandercook Larry Walsh Wellington Wilson Zarif If you subtract the sources I asterisked because they were counted in previous chapters, the final tally of Andersen's 200 some interviews is an impressive 43. That means that only 157 or so of them were unwilling to speak truth to the powerful lies of the President on the record. That so few of them were willing to follow the example of the young Obama's &quot;roommate and closest friend . . . Siddiqi&quot; and speak on the—hold on a minute.
