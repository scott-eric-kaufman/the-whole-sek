 and the phrase &quot;mistaken shootings&quot; refers to the fact that there have

 for the <em>Times</em> and a white man sneaking in a morning surf. But 
calling these incidents &quot;mistaken shootings&quot; downplays both the extent

<p>I&#39;m not sure what I find more disturbing: the fact that two members of the LAPD put <em>at least</em>
 forty-six bullets in the back of that truck or that the barrage only 
wounded the two women in the truck. Not that I wish them further injury,
 mind you, only that I&#39;m uncomfortable with the level of incompetence 
such &quot;marksmanship&quot; seems to suggest, because the police are out in 
terrible force and they are angry. If you live where I do, you don&#39;t 
need to watch the news conferences or know that over 50 members of the 
force (and their families) are in protective custody to notice, and feel
 unsettled by, the heightened police presence in Riverside and Orange 
and LA counties. I literally can&#39;t go to the doughnut store without

<p>For some reason I&#39;m reminded of the debate on campus when my undergraduate institution raised the possibility of considering having firearms-equipped security. Maybe it&#39;s a sign of my age that it didn&#39;t seem a good idea to a vast majority of the (fairly conservative) student body, and the extant unarmed security guards were exhibit A in the case against.</p>

Their solution was to up the frame rate—giving the filmmaker more information to play around with. Honestly, the 24 fps strobing never bothered me, cause if you are telling your story right, little nitpicks like the don’t enter the mind of your audience. For reasons unclear even to me, I responded to his gentle correction with A Brief and Inadequate History of Special Effects: I didn’t want to get too technical in the podcast, but I was hinting at that: 3-D created a problem that didn’t previously exist, and the solution is worse than the original problem. No more strobing, but now the effects are so obviously “special” that we may as well be watching the original Clash of the Titans. An incredible film, don’t get me wrong, it just required a superhuman suspension of disbelief. Which at the time was fine, because “special effects” like George Reeves flashing across the sky were meant to be “special,” outside of the ordinary, and didn’t need to look as if they were of this world or obeyed its laws of physics. I tend to think George Lucas ruined this fantastical acceptance of the specialness of “special” effects when he married recognizably modernist styles with space stations and star ships—the Millennium Falcon could’ve been a Le Corbusier, the stormtroopers come from the mind of an Italian fascist, and half the scenery consisted of the same brutalist style that litters my campus. Point being, his realist aesthetic made “special” effects look quaint, the people who loved them rubes, and that’s where we’ve been ever since. Realism or naught! Realism or naught! (With a few exceptions, Del Toro notably among them.) So I could understand why Jackson wanted The Hobbit to accede to the demands of the regnant style, but in doing so he utterly ruined his film. I mentioned in the podcast that the best scene in the film, Bilbo’s encounter with Gollum, looked like exactly what it was: Martin Freeman in front of a green screen talking to a man in ping-pong ball covered suit. (I know that’s not how they do it anymore but you know what I mean.) It looked like Jackson had decided to avoid the uncanny valley by introducing its monstrous child to an actual human being and hoping the audience wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. I’m not going to say it made me want to cry, but I’m not going to deny I teared up a bit at the sheer waste of it all. Like you, I’m more interested in the story, so if the technological advances can be integrated into it—like the conference tables in Avatar—I’m fine with that because it complements...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2013/02/im-only-racist-on-my-mothers-side-my-fathers-people-were-misanthropes.html"><span><strong>&quot;I'm only racist on my mother's side. My father's people were misanthropes.&quot;</strong> That Brevard Community College will be firing Sharon Sweet for compelling her students to vote for Obama is, of course, evidence that such indoctrination is ubiquitous in contemporary academia. The first comment on that Daily Caller link states the case in its strongest form: Liberal fascism at home on every campus. Exactly! Those two words always belong next to each other on campus. Goes without saying. What I find interesting about this story is that there’s no racial angle to it. Sweet’s race is never mentioned in the article nor does a search turn up an image that’s unequivocally of her. But Jim Hoft knows what she must look like, so when he did a Google Image search for “Sharon Sweet” he carefully considered all of the faces that might be hers and went with his gut. That it told him she must be the black woman in the mug shot doesn’t make Hoft himself a racist—just his gut. Which makes him, what? About thirty percent racist?</span></a></div>
