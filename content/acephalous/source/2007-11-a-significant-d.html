A significant drawback of being deaf is the concentration required to carry on a conversation. (There are others.) Since I only pick up have a word here and half a word there, I must rely on my preternatural ability to reconstruct whole words from half-heard phonemes. I acquired this skill through long hours, hard work, and the normal course of cognitive development: all I'd ever heard are half-words, so my brain developed to hear half-words. So how would I know that conversing requires more concentrating for me than the hearing world? Simple: When I'm tired, stressed, or otherwise not paying close enough attention, words break down into their constitute phonemes. (Poetry often has the same effect.) These phonemes typically migrate: the first phoneme of one word because the final of another and vice versa. Consider a previous example: One day I went to meet with my advisor. He inquired into the state of my &quot;current tree search.&quot; I stared, frozen and mute, wondering how he'd learned of my plans to purchase a potted lemon tree for the porch. &quot;I'm thinking about lemons,&quot; I blundered. Now it was his turn to stare, bewildered by my admission that I'd been considering lemons a valid object of literary study. He asked why I'd been thinking about lemons, to which I sensibly replied &quot;because there's not much room on the porch.&quot; &quot;For your work?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; &quot;Planting a lemon tree on the back porch.&quot; &quot;Why would I care about that?&quot; &quot;Then why did you ask?&quot; &quot;Then why did I ask what?&quot; &quot;About my current ...&quot; I trailed off exactly when my mouth, prepping to repeat the absurdity, clued my brain in to the nature of the misunderstanding. Sometimes, as with the lemon tree, these migrations fold neatly into the English language. Note how my brain tried to find a suitable context for my mistake: I had been planning on purchasing a tree for the porch, so my brain thrust my advisor's statement into that context. But more often than not, I'm thrust back into language with a shock of incomprehension: &quot;Did you just say—you didn't just say—did you? What?&quot; Most of the time, I don't have a plausible context ready-to-hand, so my confusion results in absurd, context-less statements. I hear words, but they're not arranged into sentences. Or I hear sentences, but the sentences make no sense. I'm hard-pressed to provide examples of what this experience is like ... or was before I learned about Benny Lava's Loony Buns. The video below the fold consists of a Bollywood musical number sung in Hindi but transliterated into English.

The jumbled phonemes and weird Hollywood (&amp; hip-hop?) -&gt; Bollywood -&gt; adolescent(?) guy in middle America -&gt; poetic context (did you know they&#39;re singing about Haiku?) cultural transfer make this one directly tap into ... some kind of unpleasant basement level or other.  Something that&#39;s going to just keep churning until I re-write this as a sonnet or something.<br />

		<span id="comment-88850978-content"><p>It&#39;s not Dadaist poetry at all, Alexei.  The original video has a sort of over-the-top, cutesy, and to my cultural frame rather odd attempt at sex appeal, which the only partially phonetic lyrics match with a sort of giggling U.S.-typical adolescent sex humor.  That&#39;s why the piece works.  I mean, perhaps the original may be a consciously ironic / camp regression of Bollywood trope -- look at the guy in the intro, going through the supercool moves with his jacket -- in turn being mocked by someone who we can in turn mock.  But it&#39;s all good humored enough so that it isn&#39;t deadening.</p>

<p>Besides, anything which allows me to turn part of Sonnet 116 into something about watersports is ispo facto good.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-88862422-content"><p>Rich, </p>

<p>I&#39;m disinclined to talk about found poetry because it relies so much on who found it.  If a certain Joe Day Deen finds a picture of a baboon that happens to depict the reason why democracy will fail, well, I attribute Joe Day Deen&#39;s interpretation to something significant; <em>i.e.</em> I think the &quot;foundednes&quot; of &quot;found art&quot; principally reflects the aesthetic judgment of the findee ... and that that&#39;s not necessary a good thing.  (Consider the plight of &quot;Emo Boy,&quot; who sees his PAIN reflected everywhere he turns.)</p>

<p>Also, are you sure it&#39;s Tamil?  I don&#39;t think Meg knows Tamil, but her translation jibed with yours, so ... damn it, I hate being married to someone who can learn languages without my realizing it sometimes.</p>

<p>Joeo, </p>

<p>Has Zukofsky did anything all that interesting?  I&#39;ve tried to read him, but found myself consistently unimpressed (not to mention bored).  This is, no doubt, a personal failure, but still ... recommendations of non-Catullus transliterations would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Alexei,</p>

<p>I had a paragraph on Dada in the original post, but deleted it because I couldn&#39;t make it swing properly.  I&#39;m inclined to think my failure accords with Rich&#39;s statement that it ain&#39;t Dada, but I&#39;m willing to be convinced otherwise (if only to justify my own initial instincts).</p></span>

		<span id="comment-88867906-content"><p>My only warrant for thinking it&#39;s Tamil comes from the two links I gave in my first comment, but as far as random links that you&#39;ve obtained from Google can look like their writers knew what they&#39;re doing, they do.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why the foundedness of the poetry really matters.  Once you get to this level of (degraded) postmodernist pastiche, everything is &quot;found&quot;.  I mean, when I realized that &quot;My loony bun is fine, Benny Lava&quot; had 10 syllables and 5 stresses, Sonnet 116 just sort of found itself being peed on, so to speak.</p>

<p>But isn&#39;t this a better washed-up-on-the-beach metaphor than the Wordsworth one?  Here, a clearly human-created artifact has washed up on Buffalax&#39; beach.  Buffalax, rather than trying to figure out what it means -- which is not the point, really -- consciously assigns it known-to-be-incorrect meanings that comically play off of the universals and/or common cultural elements that are understandable, plus off of plain old xenophobia (the original video is labelled &quot;crazy&quot;).   Unlike mysterious letters that form themselves due to no human agency, this is an archetypal form of cultural transmission -- a sort of Harold Bloomian misreading on a slapstick level.  Clearly the original artists&#39; intentions counted for something, but not everything.</p>

<p>As for aesthetic judgement, well, yeah, there&#39;s something lacking in this case.  But the example should be the same whether it&#39;s Wordwworth washing up or something decidedly more downscale.</p></span>

<p>For Zukofsky, I&#39;d start with &quot;A&quot;-11 and branch out.  That&#39;s a great, great poem, but it&#39;s in his traditional / metrical vein, which is only one corner of his practice (as the phonetics were only one corner).<br />

<p>While I&#39;m not sure I can offer a strong defense of the idea that there is something Dadaist about this clip, let me give it a shot anyway. In the first instance, the attempt to parse a foreign language according to the recognizable components of English resembles Tzara&#39;s Scissors. For, as we know, what sounds like two words (or syllables, or morphemes) to an English speaker can in fact be one (or more than two) in another language.  Think of listening to German, or whatever language you don&#39;t really speak (or for the theoretically inclined, think of Wittgenstein&#39;s remarks about how foreigners speak).  Simply put, identifying a sound pattern as &#39;sounding like Benny Lava&#39; requires a series of judgments, which &#39;cut,&#39; parse, what we&#39;re hearing. And these judgments, these &#39;original separations&#39; as Hoelderlin would have it, differentiate the recognizable from the nonsense, and allows us to fill in the blanks, to synthesize.  </p>

<p>Now I suppose this doesn&#39;t sound like Dadaist poetry. But I think we merely need to stress Tzara&#39;s dictum, &#39;Copy conscientiously&#39; (I think I&#39;ve also seen this translated as, &#39;copy faithfully&#39;).  I take it that the point is to spark certain (artistic) processes, either by automatic writing or by Tzara&#39;s poetics, but surely Dadaist poetry doesn&#39;t end with method, nor is it confined to humour, irony, etc.</p>

<p>But all this said, I&#39;m quite happy to see Shakespeare and water sports together again for the very first time -- though I wonder Rich: didn&#39;t Shakespeare beat you to it? wouldn&#39;t some kind of scat-play explain why his lover&#39;s breasts are dun coloured in Sonnet 154?  hmmm, makes you wonder.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-89178968-content"><p>Alexei, I think that the critical difference in source material and apparent intent is more important than a surface similiarity of technique.  The Dadaists were about destroying traditional esthetics and their own high culture.  This video mocks another culture.  When kids laugh at a foreigner speaking some strange language, and at how it sounds like he&#39;s saying something funny in their own language, that&#39;s not Dada.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you liked the Shakespeare bit.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-89231380-content"><p>Of course you&#39;re right, Rich, Kids laughing at a foreign language is downright wrong.  And kids mocking another culture is even wronger.  The wrongest, however, would be for kids to mock their own culture and traditions, that omnipresent source of all things good and moral.  So perhaps we should say: Kids shouldn&#39;t mock anything. And kids shouldn&#39;t be exposed to anything that mocks anything else, even -- especially -- itself. That would just be too much,  too confusing.  So, since they&#39;re just kids, and since mockery is a serious business, perhaps we should ensure that only Adults can mock stuff.  We could then tightly regulate what folks can mock by establishing shining institutions of cultural preservation, like the <a href="http://www.olf.gouv.qc.ca/" rel="nofollow">Office de la langue francaise</a>, the <a href="http://www.academie-francaise.fr/langue/index.html" rel="nofollow">Acadamie francaise</a>, the <a href="http://www.deutscheakademie.de/" rel="nofollow">Deutsche Akademie fuer Sprache und Dichtung</a> or maybe the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/montypython/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">BBC</a>; these bureaucracies could then provide training in mockery, and certify trained professionals, who would only be permitted to mock -- under penalty of being relegated to the status of low-brow, culturally offensive agitators -- the institutions that have accredited them.  But Wait! that would be a paradox: we would be mocking the High-cultural Origin of Tradition.... </p>

<p>In any event, though you&#39;re right to say that the clip isn&#39;t Dada -- <strong>yet</strong>.  It does, however, share an insight with Dada (hence my initial remark about &#39;discovering Dada,&#39; which you&#39;ve called superficial.  And now, since I&#39;m into hairsplitting, I don&#39;t think that what keeps it from being Dadaist has anything to do with the material, since as it stands, the clip could be a music video on MTV (part of it&#39;s foreign language programming, perhaps), or something of MTV&#39;s ilk. In terms of its technical or compositional elements, the clip isn&#39;t at all that different from &#39;our culture.&#39;</p>

<p>Moreover, I&#39;m not at all worried about intentions.  Some very funny stuff is unintentional, and sometimes great writing (like some parts of <em>Ulysses</em>) begins with a brilliant typo.  INdeed the whole Dadaist experiment with automatic writing was yet another attempt to invalidate such a concept. Intention is a difference that makes a difference only in jurisprudence (and maybe at cocktail parties, where the line between something humorous and saying something embarrassing has everything to do with intention). </p>

<p>So intentions aside, as there are far too many untestable assumptions involved in attributing them, I think there&#39;s more than a superficial similarity of technique, and a deeper affinity, however sophomoric, or juvenile it may be, with Dadaist style.   But I guess we&#39;re perfectly able to disagree on that matter.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-89265046-content"><p>Well, I&#39;m certainly not issuing any condemnations of mockery in general.  But I think that it particularly works in this case because the original video is so focussed on sex appeal that making fun of it in the same mode seems light-hearted, not unfair.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not a big deal, but I still think you need more than that to call it Dadaist.  Dadaism involves an ideology and a historical context.  There was once an argument on the Valve somewhere, in which Luther Blissett said that people should stop using Surrealism to describe vaguely surreal artistic effects that weren&#39;t connected to the historically specific beliefs and context of Surrealism, and I generally agree with that kind of thing.</p></span>

The phrase &quot;Do you have your hearing aids in???&quot; is heard daily in this house. I enjoy time alone because I am not overloaded with nnoise and sounds, but know it is important for me to be able to hear when dealing with seniors at work.  It just great to have another person not hearing what I am saying because they are &quot;to young&quot; to have hearing aids.  I am a perfect example for them because I am the young person wearing hearing aids so that I can hear them and solve their problems.</p></span>

I do this all the time. Nature and I are practically Communists. (We're that close.) When I'm in the desert I remember being Communists in the desert before: like this one time when I was thirsty and I needed water and saw this cactus and I ate it. Then there was the time I was thirsty but didn't see a cactus and was thirsty for a long time. I remember that time fondly. I walked up a trail and had a vision. It was moving and I was moved and then I moved along. I took my thirst with me. There was a rabbit on the path ahead that didn't look thirsty. It was a fine rabbit. I followed it. Two hours later I saw it commune with other rabbits and a man who looked suspiciously like Michael Bérubé. I asked this man for water and he brandished a hockey stick and said: &quot;What about ice?&quot; I said: &quot;Ice would be fine.&quot; &quot;Because I play hockey on ice with rabbits who aren't thirsty.&quot; I said: &quot;I envy those rabbits.&quot; The man who looked like Bérubé shot me a glance like Ira Glass and I was scared of rabbits and ran away thirsty. The hair on the back of my neck stood up as I ran down the path willy-nilly and very thirsty and then I tripped and fell down a deep magnificent hole. As I plunged to certain death I admired my hole's depth and thought &quot;What a wonderful bottom to splat on!&quot; I fell and fell and then when I felt I could fall no more I noticed I wasn't falling. The rock I'd tripped over had tripped too and landed where my head fell. My ears were ringing and I could see on my laptop that I could not be The Best 2501-3000 this year. It was then that I realized that Chris Clarke should win and that votes for me were taking away from his commanding lead. I looked in the mirror and saw my Inner Nader and pledged something importantly Communist for the common good of the desert and the rabbits and my thirst. (Note: If this makes no sense to you read this and this.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/11/homicide.html"><span><strong>The Munch Paradox</strong> Frequent commenter Todd. and I spent Saturday afternoon watching [redacted for Todd.'s peace of mind]. The conversation turned to David Simon's Homicide: Life on the Streets, then to the storied history one of Baltimore's (fictional) finest: John Munch. Munch, played by comedian Richard Belzer, will make television history when he appears on an episode of Simon's current show, The Wire , as it will mark the tenth separate program in which he has appeared as a character. In addition to being a principle on Homicide and Law &amp; Order: SVU, Munch has appeared on: Law &amp; Order Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury The Simpsons Arrested Development The Beat The X-Files Sesame Street What is it about Munch that people find so compelling? The conspiracy theories? The serial monogamy? The counter-culture radical turned cop? Whatever the reason, the ubiquity of Munch obscures an important fact: namely, that Simon's Homicide is an adaptation of his book of a similar name and that he based Munch on an actual murder police named Jay Landsman. I've taught Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets before, so I'm familiar with Landsman, of the sidelong smile and pockmarked face, who tells the mothers of wanted men that all the commotion is nothing to be upset about, just a routine murder warrant. Landsman, who leaves empty liquor bottles in the other sergeants' desks and never fails to turn out the men's room light when a ranking officer is indisposed. Landsman, who rides a headquarters elevator the police commissioner and leaves complaining that some sonofabitch stole his wallet. Jay Landsman, who as a Southwestern patrolman parked his radio car at Edmondson and Hilton, then used a Quaker Oatmeal box covered in aluminum fol as a radar gun. The pockmarked face and sneering at authority is vintage Munch. The drinking and fake radar guns? Reminds me more of this detective from The Wire. His name? Jay Landsman. He looks like this: Who looks nothing like this: And even less like this: Who is that? Why, that would be a retired Baltimore murder police by the name of Jay Landsman, playing a character named Dennis Mello on The Wire. The mind boggles. For those of you keeping score, it's possible that an upcoming episode of The Wire might now incorporate: John Munch, a character inspired by Jay Landsman Jay Landsman, a second character inspired by Jay Landsman the real Jay Landsman I should be able to draw some sort of conclusion from this, but honestly, the situation seems unprecedented. Have there ever been two fictionalized versions of the same guy and the guy himself running around the same television show? There must be a meta-meta-meta-point to be drawn from this—something more sophisticated than &quot;David Simon, he loves him some Landsman&quot;—but I'm at a loss for what it might be.</span></a></div>
