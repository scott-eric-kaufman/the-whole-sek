<p>Hi <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hertz?directed_target_id=0">Hertz</a>!
  Remember me? I&#39;m the deaf guy your Ontario, CA employees mocked this  
morning. I spent the better part of the day talking my way up from one  
middle-manager to another and was PROMISED that I&#39;d get a call &quot;later&quot;  
from someone with the authority to 1) answer my very simple, basic  
question and 2) explain to me why Hertz employees are encouraged to  
behave as they do. (Do you WANT to drive away customers? Because I don&#39;t
  see that being a successful long-term business model.)</p>
<p>Point  being, I&#39;m supposed to pick up my SUV tomorrow morning, but as
 I told  every rung on your corporate ladder, I refuse to honor my 
reservation if  the people who willfully and maliciously dishonored me 
today are  working the counter. I&#39;ve asked for assurances that they 
wouldn&#39;t be,  but have heard nothing. I&#39;ve asked for an explanation as 
to why they  were allowed to do so in the first place, but I&#39;ve heard 
nothing.</p>
<p>Basically, I&#39;ve heard nothing except &quot;later,&quot; and now &quot;later&quot; is  
creeping into &quot;tomorrow.&quot; Should you ever again desire the business of  
the communities to which I belong -- deaf and hearing alike -- I  
strongly recommend that someone with the ability to address my concerns 
 contacts me sooner rather than &quot;later.&quot;</p>

Here’s our take on “Lord Snow,” the series’ third episode. And before you ask: yes, the podcast did explode before we had a chance to finish it. We'll cover the four minutes we lost in two weeks, after I've moved and settled in. Which also means, obviously, that there won't be a podcast next week, as I'll be moving and settling in. Try not to miss me too much. Works SEK discusses: &quot;Lord Snow,&quot; you're no bigger than a half-man. Works Attewell discusses (warning, all of these posts contain spoilers for all five books): Daenerys III (on assimilation and how Viserys fails to use its power) Bran IV (old Nan’s stories and the meta-history of Westeros) Eddard IV (Eddard’s first Small Council meeting, first assessment of his political skills, and the Littlefinger embezzlement question) Catelyn IV (the knife, Littlefinger the gambler, his historical counterpart, and how he contrasts with Varys) Jon III (the Watch as an institution in decline, Jon Snow getting over his privilege) Arya II (Arya as a deconstruction of the fantasy heroic protagonist, Syrio Forel and famous swordswomen) Video: Audio: You can listen to the above podcast here. Archives: Back to the beginning with “Winter Is Coming” (S01E01). Life is &quot;The Kingsroad,&quot; they want to ride it all night long (S01E02). Our very civilized discussion of the premiere (S03E01). Fancy-talking about “Dark Wings, Dark Words” (S03E02). Here we are blathering on about “Walk of Punishment” (S03E03). Don’t watch — because you can’t — us discuss “And Now His Watch Has Ended” (S03E04). The rudely interrupted first half of our discussion of “Kissed by Fire” (S03E05). The second half of our discussion of religion in “Kissed by Fire” (S03E05). In which we discuss “The Climb” sans spoilers (S03E06). “The Climb” with spoilers (S03E06). “Second Sons.” We has them (S03E08). Belatedly, “The Bear and the Maiden Fair” (S03E07). You’re all invited to an epic performance of “The Rains of Castamere” (S03E09). This is the end … the end of Season Three (S03E10).</span></a></div>
