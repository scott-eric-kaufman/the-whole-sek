		<span id="comment-13743768-content"><p>An interesting exercise might be to ponder substitute words/phrases for dude.</p>

<p>Example:  <br />
Speaker A:  So did you go out last night?<br />
Speaker B:  Dude...I didn&#39;t get home til 3.</p>

<p>&quot;Dude,&quot; in the above exchange, is used as a signpost, the removal of which would deflate the breathless anticipation surely felt by Speaker A.  Beginning a sentence with &quot;dude&quot; here sends notice that news of awe-inspiring male triumph will soon be revealed.  But what might substitute for &quot;dude?&quot;  </p>

<p>I&#39;m also strangely amused by women that refer to each other as &quot;dude.&quot;  Dude is apparently gender-neutral.  Or its use among women may just be plain old penis envy.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-13744264-content"><p>Not penis-envy. But I do use it. I kind of don&#39;t know why, other than what Scott&#39;s post declares:  Dude is a conversation, in and of itself. One of my closest girl friends and I use it in all the ways he mentions.  We don&#39;t refer to ourselves or each other as &quot;dude&quot; (as in, You are The Dude! (man, woman, etc).  But we say &quot;hey, dude, what&#39;s up&quot; all the time.  For women, it&#39;s a substitute/synonym for &quot;girl,&quot; &quot;chica,&quot; which sound pretty annoying after a while.  What is most enjoyable are the emotions &quot;dude&quot; can convey depending on inflection.  So in that respect, given the stereotypical ability of women to communicate feelings, &quot;dude&quot; is really quite useful.</p>

<p>Also, maybe it&#39;s a Southern California thing. I also use &quot;yo&quot; and &quot;homie&quot; a lot.  As in &quot;Hey Homie, s&#39;up.&quot; </p>

<p>I do wish that it was completely gender neutral though. There is a sociologist that subtitles his blog &quot;My life and thoughts as an Asian-American professor/sociologist/liberal/dude.  I always wished that I could use &quot;dude&quot; like that. I HATE &quot;dudette.&quot;  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-13818590-content"><p>ok, here it is (imagine classical musical background as this is explained):<br />
Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today, is the word fuck. Of all the English words beginning with f, fuck is the single one referred to as the &quot;f-word&quot;. It&#39;s the one magical word. Just by it&#39;s sound it can describe pain, pleasure, hate and love. Fuck, as most of the other words in English, has arrived from Germany. Fuck from German&#39;s &quot;fliechen&quot; which mean to strike. In English, fuck folds into many grammatical categories. As a transital verb for instance, &quot;John fucked Shirley&quot;. As an intransitive verb; &quot;Shirley fucks&quot;. It&#39;s meaning is not always sexual, it can be used as an adjective such as; John&#39;s doing all the fucking work. As part of an adverb; &quot;Shirley talks too fucking much&quot;, as an adverb enhancing an adjective; Shirley is fucking beautiful. As a noun; &quot;I don&#39;t give a fuck&quot;. As part of a word: &quot;abso-fucking-lutely&quot; or &quot;in-fucking-credible&quot;. Or as almost every word in a sentence: &quot;fuck the fucking fuckers!&quot;. As you must realize, there aren&#39;t many words with the versitility such as the word fuck,as in these examples used as the following words;<br />
- fraud: &quot;I got fucked&quot;<br />
- trouble: &quot;I guess I&#39;m really fucked now&quot;<br />
- dismay: &quot;Oh, fuck it!&quot;<br />
- aggresion: &quot;don&#39;t fuck with me, buddy!&quot;<br />
- difficulty: &quot;I don&#39;t understand this fucking question&quot;<br />
- inquery: &quot;who the fuck was that?&quot;<br />
- dissatisfaction: &quot;I don&#39;t like what the fuck is going on here&quot;<br />
- incompetence: &quot;he&#39;s a fuck-off!&quot;<br />
- dismissal: &quot;why don&#39;t you go outside and fuck yourself?&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you can think of many more examples.<br />
With all these multipurpoused applications, how can anyone be offended when you use the word?<br />
Use this unique, flexibel word more often in your daily speech. It will identify the quality of your character immediately. Say it loudly and proudly:<br />
FUCK YOU! <br />

		<span id="comment-141030856-content"><p>I stumbled upon this DUD while searching for a downloadable version of the famously classic Jack Wagner outtake/break illustrating the use of the word FUCK. </p>

<p>As a blinding example of the pathetic lack of originality infecting Blog-generation, it demands I take the time to share some observations:<br />
1. Dude, the disquisition on the use of Dude is such a fuking weak ripoff of Jack Wagner&#39;s satire that it fails in every attempt at comedy. The idiot who provided the WRITTEN description of the use of the word fails to realize that the audio is KEY to the comedic success. This is the primary ineptitude that inspired me to read what kind of idiotic comments could have been generated. <br />
2. The dude who found the word &#39;disquisition&#39; is clearly familiar with a book called a thesaurus, but needs to check the definition for bombastic and elucidate himself.<br />
3. The dudette, or, if I may be so bold as to offer DUD as an alternative, fails to realize that the gender of the word is also vital to its usage and meaning. In other words chica, find your own fucking word for yourself instead of being so lazy that you use one of a masculine gender. <br />
4. Lastly, the grain of data that led me to this pit of the pitifully unconscious and uninformed was Jack Wagner, an unmistakeable voiceover master who cannot possibly be mistaken for any other performer. This recording is not a &#39;video&#39; you idiot. It is AUDIO, an incredibly rich medium often used for comedy, and it should never have been sullied by the video additions I have seen. It stands alone, needing no augmentation, but if a video were to be added, it should be a filmstrip, rolling painfully behind in its timing to the audio, probably text only, perhaps sentence diagraming to identify the proper parts of speech.</p>

<p>Jack made a career of audio voiceovers, accompanying filmstrips for public school and other governmental training programs. As instructional medium, predating computers and video, I believe I can state that it truly sucked. It was almost funny that it WAS an instuctional tool, except that we were forced to watch and listen to them.<br />
 <br />
Along with many hilarious outtakes, this recording was probably meant to be discarded, but was saved by some unknown and brilliant technician recognizing the spontaneous satirical genious. Wagner later came to love the recording (or so he said) and he actually re-recorded it, in exactly the same manner as dozens of other grammar-instruction filmstrip products.<br />
 <br />
Monty Python and George Carlin are and were fantastic comedic geniouses. Their voices, equally unmistakeable would object to my wasting the time it has taken to type this comment. <br />
The gang of Brits would almost certainly read your drivel in character as the Village Idiot, or perhaps the upper-class dullard with the overbite. <br />
George, being much less tolerant in his old age, would turn around and drop a shit on every one of you for being so painfully unoriginal, uninformed, and apparently incapable of independent or logical thought. He spins in his grave thinking that you attributed this beautiful satire to anyone but Wagner, and realizing that all his effort to try to get you to THINK had failed.</p>

<p>Sorry George, I&#39;ve tried too, but I think it&#39;s the wrong audience.</p></span>

Reading '70s review literature on the longstanding Realism vs. Romance debate, it is impossible to mistake the grumpy old guard's contempt for the young proud and profoundly theoretical. One reviewer remarks how in his newly tenured compatriot's sealed world of romance, all reality is textual, and as theorists have taught us, when scrutinized closely textual realities unravel to reveal the void at the center, or, in some of the manifestations of the idea presented [in this book], a &quot;discontinuously woven&quot; text &quot;may have no magic in its web&quot;; an attempt at representation points to the &quot;absence of the represented entity&quot;; the &quot;moment of origin&quot; becomes the &quot;sign of a loss&quot;; the novel is &quot;a record of an absence, a deferred and indirect account of a direct exposure. Nothing unusual here. A reviewer doesn't want to &quot;do the deconstruction.&quot; His reviewee most emphatically does. All is well in academia. Only as I continued reading the review I noticed something different about this criticism . . . something I wouldn't expect in contemporary. The reviewer chides the reviewee for imputing to the authors whose works he studies an awareness of the deconstructive principle. To wit: Yet it is not the post-modernist critic who unties the twisted strands of codes and conventions . . . that compose these novels, but the romancers themselves, who, because they are deeply aware of the unstable verbal space of their texts, have already problematized the uncertain relationship between readers and writers. You're more than welcome to gawk. This reviewer complains that the book he reviews substantiates its claim via authorial intent instead of critical acumen. What world did these two men live in? One in which an awareness for the limitations of language belongs to author and critic alike . . . in which the critic finds in the words of the author evidence of theoretically applicability instead of forcing the author's words into some framework as becoming as an octogenerian in a thong. Not that the imposition is unwarranted at times. Some authors un-self-consciously larded their novels with fine critical pickings. Conrad may have thought about the implications of his dovetailed theories of race and colonialism but it took Said's perspective to snap them into place. That is certainly true. But sometimes in this field in which hyper-production has become the norm of necessity . . . and in which the path of least unproductivity contains critical jewels enough to write fifteen books . . . in such a situation the normative mode of analysis privileges the critic over the author every time. The author is the base metal from which the critic will construct the ladder he'll climb up from promotion to promotion. At least that's how it sometimes seems. Reading the same argument by the same critic in different articles about different authors will do that to a body.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/extract_of_a_le.html"><span><strong>Extract of a Letter, Written from Paris, containing an Account of fome Effects of the Transfufion of Bloud; and of two Monftrous Births, &amp;c.</strong> From Philosophical Transactions (1666): In the Houfe of M. Bourdelots was fhew'd a Monfter in form of an Ape, having all over its fhoulders, almoft to his middle, a mafs of flefh, that came from the hinder part of its head, and hung down in form of a little Cloak. The report is, that the Woman that brought it forth, had feen on a Stage an Ape fo cloathed: The moft remarkable thing was, that the faid mafs of flefh was divided in four parts, correfpondent to the Coat, the Ape did carry. The Woman, upon inquiry, was found to have gone five months Child, before fhe had met with the acceident of that unhappy fight. Many questions were on this occafion agitated: viz. about the Power of Imagination; and whether this Creature was endow'd with a humane Soul; and if not, what became of the Soul of the Embryo, that was five months old. Back in the good ol' days literature mattered. Pregnant women with overactive imaginations would produce monstrous births resembling something they saw on stage at some point during the pregnancy. Not to mention those fellows had the whole abortion thing solved pat: Baby souls are either malleable or interstitial. If malleable, a woman could take in a play, transform her baby into something monstrous and demand her abomination be aborted. (Depending on the cast she may create something wholly unfit for human parturition. Her life would therefore depend on aborting the beast in her womb before it grew too large or abominable to be removed.) If baby souls are interstitial, then the thing being aborted is as human as a chicken or a cod and therefore not entitled to any special treatment. Unless the interstitial baby soul is some sort of loaner, in which case it would've been returned upon successful egression from the birth canal and is merely being returned early. They had it all figured out. Where did we go so terribly, terribly wrong?</span></a></div>
