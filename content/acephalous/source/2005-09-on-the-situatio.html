Not an angry rant, but a grieving one.  Loving the city as much as you clearly do, I trust you&#39;re more hysterical than this sounds ... </p>

		<span id="comment-9032989-content"><p>My work brings me into contact with emergency planners and firefighters, and this whole bungled situation is absolutely illustrative of where America is right now.  I mean, how smart do you have to be to send out the hospital ships not now, but before the storm reaches land?  Not very.  Yet it wasn&#39;t done.  </p>

<p>And is it purely Bush&#39;s fault?  In a proximate sense, yes.  But he is empowered not only by the moronic hordes of the religious right, but also by every libertarian who disdains managerial liberalism and talks up the market.  You want a free market?  You&#39;ve got one in New Orleans right now, perfectly unregulated.  America is fundamentally unserious, from the conservatives who think that the most important thing is repressing sexuality, to the postmodernists who think that reality is purely socially constructed, to the blissed-out Republican pols who think that they can create reality; not one of them is an adult in anything but name.</p>

<p>And there are other completely forseeable catastrophes waiting in the wings.  Wait until avian flu hits.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-9042584-content"><p>I thought it was pretty temperate too.  It&#39;s admirable you could even be so.  The failure at local levels is atrocious, but the federal failure is exactly like they are about everything--I don&#39;t have the words for what they have uniquely become.  This proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt.  Although since an object of disgust to many of us, Giuliani did give New York a sense of some way to get through it--the president was barely visible then either, working on using it for Iraq.  The 2 tragedies are physically different, of course, with 9/11 occurring in a relatively small area, not even causing much physical damage nearby, but this is so shameful and heartbreaking, in many ways the most disgraceful moment on American soil.</p></span>

(Though truth be told, for the humanistically inclined any hobby which involves crunching numbers shouldn't be considered &quot;passive.&quot; Still, this one--despite the mathematics involved--is more than a whit indulgent.) All of that said, all I can say is that I've so much to say that I can hardly decide where to start. There's the umbicular connection I share with my malfunctioning laptop. I realize this, recognize the problem and scream inside my head everytime I can't record some mundanity in an ephemeral email to myself (which I'll never read or even remember writing come day's end). Then there's the fact that My Hometown (despite my self-identification with Brooklyn and northern New Jersey and the years spent in the Canadian hinterland), what Huey Long compulsively called &quot;The Great State of Louisiana,&quot; currently stands more submerged than usual come creole August, and that the estimated death toll rises with every learned estimation. The emails I've received from friends in the midst of it remain unencouraging. One friend's father has lost everything, another's mother only materialized after three agonizingly uncommunicative days, and still another's brother remains among the missing. I could blather on for days about what the tragedy that is My Hometown at this moment, but my blather would only trivialize the magnitude of the events about which I blather. On a similarly somber subject, Badger (of Badgerings) lost her husband last Monday. Even though I only know her through that most tenuous of tenuous connections (the polite acknowledgment of the link), I send my sympathies and (were I one to pray) all the prayers I know. But since I'm not one to pray I'll settle for sending my thoughts, so that she knows her husband's touched lives so distant, so removed, and will not be forgetton. (And while it may seem untoward to address her grief in so omnibus an entry, since I don't know when I'll have unfettered access again, I think the sentiment outweighs whatever violation of decorum I've committed. Best to you and yours in your time of trials, Badger.) Come Monday I decided to attend this year's MLA (so that I've experienced one before I scour another for reasonable job offers) and have no idea how to follow through with this decision. Do I purchase a ticket, book a hotel room and wander from motel-to-hotel in search of thems that I know and thems that I'd like to? (Paging Mr. McLemee, Mr. McCann,...</span></a></div>

Makes a Statement of Conditions— Noble Response to Appeals By dark the entire city was submerged. The flooding of the electric-light plant and the gas plants left the city in darkness. To go upon the streets was to court death. The wind was then at cyclonic velocity, roofs, cisterns, portions of buildings, telegraph poles, and walls were falling, and the noise of the wind and the crashing of the buildings was terrifying in the extreme. During all this time the people...were like rats in traps. The histest portion of the city was four to five feet under water, while in the great majority of cases the streets were submerged to a depth of ten feet. To leave a house was to drown. To remain was to court death in the wreckage. Such a night of agony has seldom equaled.
