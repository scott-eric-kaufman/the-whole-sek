A discriminative act resulting in this book lacked sufficient discrimination. What I learned was: Titchner was born in the English town of Chichester. His family had little money. With the help of scholarship, he got admitted into Malvern College and then entered into Oxford University from where he took his bachelor's degree. This also completed his training as a physiologist. But he was dissatisfied with what he had learned till now. Therefore, he went to Germany at Leipzig University to get training with famous Wilhelm Wundt. He studied with Wundt for 2 years, that is, from 1890 to 1892 and obtained his doctorate degree in 1892. His dissertation was on binocular effects of monocular stimulation. Although Titchner spent only two years with Wundt, he (Wundt) made a great impression on him—an impression which was never obliterated. After returning from Leipzig, Titchner became an extension lecturer of Oxford. He would have liked to remain at Oxford but the English were not ready to show any sympathy or even were not ready to accept the &quot;new&quot; psychology of Titchner. Therefore he decided to immigrate to America at Cornell University where he remained for the rest of his life, that is, for nearly thirtyfive [sic] years. [...] During his thirtyfive [sic] years [sic] brilliant career at the Cornell University [sic sic sic], he established his system, wrote articles and books and guided research students. [...] During the last years of his life, the interest of Titchner turned from psychology to numismatics or coin collecting. He died in 1927 probably [!] due to a brain tumor.

Knowing that someone, somewhere thought this should be published is a powerful mental enervation. I can finish the dissertation which will have been written for seven years, that is, from 2001 to 2008. Then I think I should compose a profoundly amusing quiz for you readers in which I present passages about Francis Galton, cousin of the famous Charles, from my Twain chapter alongside excerpts from this book and have you guess what is their origin.

<p>Just think of your dissertation not so much as the defining document that shows your professional skills so much as a chat transcript during a long game you&#39;ve been playing.  I&#39;d say to go with something like:</p>

<p>Galton FTL!  Great cvariations in mental exp., lol XD</p></span>

Without students there can be no inappropriate office sex. Scott keeps linking to that post even though everyone (except the new readers who email a cultivated OMG! every time he links to it) has already read it. Blogs cannot be good by definition. Scott never replies to comments anymore, even though he would like to, but must focus on finishing the dissertation he'll never finish. Fans can tell when narrative arcs stall (because Scott still hasn't finished his dissertation). Too much time blogging elsewhere leaves the people who love Scott and Scott alone despondent. Did Scott mean Hanukkah and must he not be a terrible Jew what with the spurious transliteration of offense? Scott is now an old person and blogs are 2 b 4 the young and young at heart. Writing a dissertation for seven years might as well be abusing crystal meth for how rapidly it ages your proverbial heart (like the before-and-after addict they use to scare children straight). Scott has written on the same topics so often he has crippled Google's ability to index his site (and thus his ability to find that thing he knows he wrote about back in the summer of a year maybe beginning with a two). But for a short-lived dalliance with a single column that ended in open revolt, the layout and color scheme haven't changed since the day the blog went live in 1922. Now that I, being you, think about it, it never really was that good (not even in 1922 when America had flappers). Scott still hasn't finished his dissertation.</span></a></div>
