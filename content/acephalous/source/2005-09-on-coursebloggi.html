		<span id="comment-9739345-content"><p>Thanks for these reflections. I&#39;ve looked at your courseblog with interest. I&#39;d be curious to hear more about your experiences this quarter, particularly the student response. My courseblogs have enabled me to communicate so much more with my students outside of class, and for their benefit primarily (extra notes, clarifying muddy points from an animated class discussion etc.) What&#39;s harder to do is inculcate in them a sense of the potential for interactivity and community that this medium can allow. Let&#39;s post back on this subject at the end of our terms with feedback from our students. It will be interesting to examine their response to our interest and belief in courseblogging.</p></span>

I want to know how Americans mangled his thought during the &quot;Nietzsche vogue&quot; of 1897-1908. (Those dates aren't as random as they seem, but I lack sufficient energy to justify my bracketing.) A Polaroid of this fissure between intellectuals (like Adam) and intellectual historians (like Yours Truly) looks something like this: intellectuals are more interested in the causes than their effects, whereas intellectual historians are more interested in the effects than their causes. So how did Americans mangle Nietzsche during his very own vogue? Arthur Allin's review of Alexander Tille's Von Nietzsche bis Darwin (1897) in The Journal of American Psychology neatly captures both the common misinterpretations and the shrill tone with which they were voiced: Nietzsche, the erratic, the eccentric, the aphoristic and the modern oracular Zarathurstrian, is for [Tille] the high-water mark of the tide which has been rising so steadily since Darwin’s days. Spencer, Leslie Stephen, Wundt, Huxley, Fiske, Williams, Bebel and others are shown to be so many landscapes on the road to Nietzsche. The trend of thought is, of course, biological and evolutionary. The Abermensch, the Beyond-Man, is the continued goal. A race of laughing lions is coming, strong men full of deeds and vigor. The cry is not Repent! but the true Metanoia, change of life and conduct; not so much humility and penance, as Grecian valor and Roman virtus. A high aristocratic Herrenclasse, the product of natural selection is his ideal. Consumptives must not marry. Only the fittest must survive.</span></a></div>
