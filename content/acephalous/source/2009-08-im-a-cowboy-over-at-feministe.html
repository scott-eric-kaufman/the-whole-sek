An email exchange with Andrew sealed the deal: whatever academic blogging will become, it should not be so brazenly political. The larger world can be engaged without directly engaging the larger world. I want my spaces to be free not from dissent so much as formula: no one benefits from a common increase in the rigidity of all opinions. I will still venture into unfriendly wilds with abandon, but I will no longer invite the jungle in for drinks. I can interact with everyone who participated on that thread individually, which goes to show that the internet may be less like a classroom and more like office hours. Maybe I ought to start treating it as such. What does this mean? Acephalous will no longer tackle politics unless they directly relate to something in which I possess some expertise. (Granted, that would not have stopped me from commenting on Gates, what with me having focused issues of race and community leading up to the dissertation, but the general principle is solid nonetheless.) My contributions to Edge of the American West will focus on the relationship of literary history to history history. All jokes about trolling and trawling to the contrary, that is why they hired me in the first place. More from me on The Valve. I'm its editor and it's my field and it's time to put these post-dissertation doubts to rest. I need to do what I was trained to do instead of worrying about whether everyone will see that my degree was undeserved. I'll embrace my new gig, which is . . . roll some drums . . . at Feministe. A few weeks back I sent Jill an email in which I admitted to spending Monday mornings sifting through Sunday's shameless self-promotions and having to fight the urge to post a number of those links at one of my places so as to not to be tacky. Starting this week, I'll be collating them over there. (Not sure exactly how that'll work yet, but I'm working on it.) I'll link to it from here, because I can't overstate how much those Mondays have changed me. I'll delve into the how and the why over there come Monday. I'm terrible at mission statements, but figure that if ever there's a time to make one, it's when your desk is pointed a different direction in a new city full of unfamiliar but not unpleasant smells. That time is now. [Thanks, happy.]</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/08/leverage-and-the-liberal-pornographic.html"><span><strong>Leverage and the Liberal Pornographic</strong> Unlike their counterparts on The Definite-Indefinite Article-Team, the Robin Hoods on John Rogers and Chris Downey's Leverage aren't joyful militarists whose idea of helping people invariably involves vans and walls. Because, unlike Leverage, that other show was a guy's show. It was male-driven. It was written by guys. It was directed by guys. It was acted by guys. It's about what guys do. We talked the way guys talked. We were the boss. We were the God. We smoked when we wanted. We shot guns when we wanted. It was the last truly masculine show. In the 1980s, heroism only came from the barrel of guns aimed by incompetent men at similarly scattershot adversaries—because for all the gunplay, no one was ever shot. When these world-historically poor shots grew tired of wasting ammunition, they would chase each other in vans until one of them found a wall in need of Kool-Aid, then someone would punch someone, everyone would laugh, and the day would somehow have been saved. The Definite-Indefinite Article-Team was a male fantasy about a world in which simpleminded evil could be thwarted by brute force, the implication being that had the government allowed these clowns—who, the audience was to believe, were once ex-Special Forces—free rein in Vietnam, America would have won the war. How you win a war with soldiers who can barely hit the broad side of a barn with a van is beside the point: the 1980s needed manly men to manly deeds, and when they did, nothing made much sense, but everything worked out. [Insert here a clunky summary of the arching plot. Describe how it's a show in which a former insurance investigator hires the talented specialists he formerly investigated to help those that corporations have rendered helpless. Maybe mention that the official website describes it as a show that features &quot;elaborate scams designed to exact revenge against those who use power and wealth to victimize people.&quot; Then move on because exposition is necessary, but good God damn, is it ever boring.] With Leverage, the issue isn't whether nothing makes sense and everything works out, but whether the audience can make sense of how everything worked out. According to John Rogers: Testing indicates—and I'm not kidding—that about 30% of our audience never understands the con at all. Despite the fact that almost one-third of viewers have no clue what's happening or why, Americans have voted with their eyes and elected Leverage the most popular show on basic cable. Which means that Americans love something they don't understand, fully aware that they're not understanding it. Unlike Twin Peaks, where the ignorance was as collective as its ratings were impressive, Leverage is a caper show, so the visceral narrative enjoyment should come from watching the plot hatch. Let me literalize that: Ideally, the audience should watch a hen have sex with a mutant rooster, then see the egg appear and, knowing what's in the egg, watch with gleeful anticipation as the fox steals into the hen...</span></a></div>
