<p>Why the tribes simply didn't donate another Zamboni is beyond me.&nbsp; By now they must have known the terrible truth that <em>Jews love Zambonis</em>.&nbsp; Their sultry Italian names remind wealthy Jews of forbidden thrusts in bombed out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiksa">shiksa</a> brothels.&nbsp; The thought of their shiny hulls resurfacing ice recalls some Old Testament obliteration of enemies of the wandering Jewish state.&nbsp; The Zamboni symbolizes the Jewish love of slates wiped clean and women whose touch corrupts.&nbsp; <em>Or so you would think.&nbsp; </em>It turns out Abramoff simply decided Native Americans didn't need Zambonis any more than he didn't, and that if it came down to who needed-it-less more, than the more less-needy party which deserved it was his own.&nbsp; And if they complained, <em>his front company was the beneficiary of the Native Americans' life insurance policies</em>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Pornography.&nbsp; Not the pornographic material already illegal, mind you, but the kind that depicts and is marketed to consenting adults.&nbsp; (You!&nbsp; Put down that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Dworkin">Dworkin</a>!&nbsp; This debate is not that debate but another one entirely!&nbsp; We can have <em>that</em> debate later <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/article312997.ece">if we don't drown first</a>.)&nbsp; For those of you who may be confused, this announcement is a complete coincidence.&nbsp; The Administration did not plan to announce the new Department of Hardcore Pornography on the same day the story of the Jew who swindled the Indians in order to buy Zambonis broke.&nbsp; I repeat:</p>

<p>This.&nbsp; Is.&nbsp; Your.&nbsp; Garden.&nbsp; Variety.&nbsp; Coincidence.</p>

		<span id="comment-9630638-content"><p>I will now violate many rules of blog etiquette and comment on my own post:</p>

<p>Despite making light of the events mentioned above, I must admit that I only joke because I&#39;m infuriated by the absurdity of it all.  <i>Zambonis?</i>  I&#39;d have preferred the money be used to prepare the little Jewlings for their Bar and Bat Mitzvahs.  Instead Abramoff macerated logic by purchasing Zambonis for nonexistent hockey rinks!  I&#39;m often ashamed of my people (for much the same reason that I&#39;m often ashamed of <i>all</i> people, only I feel more a party to the shame of those who repudiate--in deeds but certainly not words--the same heritage I&#39;ve spent the past decade disowning).  We should know better than to prey on the weak and powerless; but then again, so should pretty much everyone else.  It&#39;s like <a href="http://www.calendarlive.com/tv/cl-et-earl20sep20,0,4475485.story?coll=cl-home-more-channels" rel="nofollow">Carson Daly says</a>: &quot;I believe in karma.&quot;  (Yes, there is a context for that remark, and yes, there&#39;s quite a story as to why I enjoy Jason Lee&#39;s jacked-up stupidity as much as I do, but that will have to wait until the inaugural <i>Acephalous Review of New Television Shows Scott Has Bothered To Watch</i>.

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/rich_on_wolfe.html"><span><strong>Rich on Wolfe</strong> [I swear I didn't post this for the title alone. Sometimes comments just deserve to be posts, and since Rich doesn't have a blog of his own I'm the one duty-bound to do the elevating. What follows is the coda to his conversation with Jonathan. I don't necessarily agree with all of it (to be specific some of Philip K. Dick's hack-work stinks to me of hack-work), but it deserves a showcase. So on with Rich's show.] Rather than just respond to Jonathan, I should say what I think of Wolfe directly (although I'll probably be repeating myself from earlier in the thread). It's not that he's a bad writer. He's a second-rate writer, because he sets up expectations that he does not fulfill. Certain aspects of his books are good enough so that I am jolted out of the mindset of reading yet another work of commercial fantasy, and once I am, I discover that too much of the work remains inflected by commercial fantasy. With regard to the New Sun books, commonly regarded as his best series, I've already gone into the problems that I see in it: the classic and transparent plot devices, the puzzle-box authorial fiddling, the careless use of torture fetishism as a character booster. I think that Scott is right that Wolfe has a single tone for many of his works (I haven't read them all -- just the five New Sun books, some of the short stories, the Swords books, and the Wizard Knight books), and it's a tone that enables him to indulge himself in his weaknesses. I'm sure that he really is interested in heroes who lose their memory, who have died and come back, who aren't who they think they are, and so on, but these characteristics of his protagonists also allow him a free hand with stage management, which he really should avoid allowing himself. A writer should be judged on his best work, I suppose, and there are certainly writers who I think are first-rate (such as PKD) who have churned out some very inferior hackwork. But when PKD did hackwork, it always seemed like he was at least trying to be worthwhile, and I can't always say that for Wolfe. Case in point: the Wizard Knight books. These two books are a pastiche, and he attempts to get around this by saying over and over that he knows it's a pastiche, he's doing it on purpose, it's a homage! But, just like Grunge in my quote above, that doesn't really make it any more than what it is. The rest of this comment will take the Wizard Knight books as an example; I don't think there are many plot revelations that you don't encounter early in the first book, but you have been warned. The basic conceit of the books is taken from Yves Meynard's _The Book of Knights_ (a much better book). Wolfe credits Meynard in the acknowledgements. There is, as with the New Sun books,...</span></a></div>

Today I hear from my family in Houston that they're evacuating to Baton Rouge to dodge Rita. (But it's about time for another Storm of the Century, now that we're finished dealing with the political, structural and emotional fallout from Katrina.[1]) At least this time all the politicos understand that their careers are on the line, so the people of Galveston (which has seen its fair share of powerful hurricanes before) have already begun evacuating the barrier island off the single road connecting it to the mainland. (When will the calls to permanently abandon Galveston begin? How long before Dennis Hastert pens some inflammatory, inappropriate and insensitive remarks? Galveston, after all, doesn't front the planet's fourth busiest port complex.) At this point I'm almost tempted to say that the entire South should be reconfigured along the lines of &quot;the perpetual train&quot; in China Mieville's Iron Council. Put the whole region on rails. Instead of evacuating the people, whenever the latest Storm of the Century barrels down on some Southern coastline the South can pick up its skirts, lay down its rails and evacuate itself. (Given his impressive breakdown of the failure of the federal, state and local governments to respond to Katrina I wonder why he hasn't beat me to the punch.) Ugh. I thought I was finished with this particular panic attack for the 2005 Hurricane Season. [1] Because the history of New Orleans (according to Wikipedia) is no longer subdivided into &quot;Colonial Era,&quot; &quot;19th Century,&quot; &quot;20th Century&quot; and &quot;Hurricane Katrina.&quot;</span></a></div>
