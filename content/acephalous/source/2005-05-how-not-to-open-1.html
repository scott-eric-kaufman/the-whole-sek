				<p>Despite the insistence of some prominent (and some
not-so-prominent) literary critics on the value of criticism for criticism’s
sake, literary criticism ought to abhor a vacuum. If nothing else, literature ought to provide
the occasion for the critic’s labored prose and tangled syntax. Evidence of what I deem the proper mode of
literary criticism abounds in <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>’s critical canon. Neither superior nor subservient to Hawthorne’s romance, these
essays engage in an interactive dialogue with <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> as a
work of literature. This may seem
simpleminded or wrongheaded of me: if you believe it the former, forgive me my
stupidity; if the latter, I welcome your new low opinion of me. This brief, highly directed reading of
critical history of <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> demonstrates the proper role of
literature in literary studies, as an occasion for critical enterprise
(irrespective of the theoretical allegiances of the critic undertaking
it). Of course, this little polemic of
mine concerns only what falls under the aegis of literary criticism or literary
studies. Cultural studies, media
studies, intellectual histories and the like serve a purpose, but one distinct
from literary studies (if only by virtue of their primary object of
investigation). </p>

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>The
Scarlet Letter</em>’s status as a canonical work of American literature assures
its treatment by each and every (earth-shatteringly significant but ultimately)
fleeting critical fancy. Determining
(or, I’m tempted to say, limiting) the focus of <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>’s
critical apparatus is then either frighteningly easy or impossibly
complex. In a reductive sense, the
criticism’s focus is on the narrative and the events that occur therein (what
we as undergraduates referred to as “the plot”). Regardless of their theoretical orientation,
all critics address the issues addressed (albeit, with varying degrees of
salience) by “the plot.” (The grossest
reduction necessary to sustain this reading is, obviously enough, the necessary
exclusion of “The Custom House” from its purview.) A more complex approach acknowledges the
determinative effects of a theoretical orientation on the generation of
significance in a literary work like <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, meaning that in
each transitory critical moment critics are, in effect, reading a <em>Scarlet
Letter</em> different from that of their predecessors. To prevent this polemic against the
theorizing of theory from falling prey to the logic it rejects, we need to
examine the critical apparatus that has grown up (though by no means
organically) around Hawthorne’s romance. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">However,
first we need to account for why such an apparatus would grow in the first
place. A “great” literary work would
not, according the working definition I’m developing, transcend the critic’s
mundane task so much as it merely (and you can read that “merely” as ironically
or unironically as is your wont) precedes it. Prior but not superior to the critical enterprise, a literary text like <em>The
Scarlet Letter</em> occasions a mode of speculation categorically different from
the one engendered by, for example, a historical treatise on the effect of the
theological doctrine subtending Puritan legalism on the formation of “female”
as an autonomous subject position in Boston circa 1650. The question is not “what mode of
speculation?” or “which particular theoretical methodology?” <em>The Scarlet
Letter</em> summons from the void so much as why one is summoned in the first
place. Scanning through the secondary
literature, one (note: not “the”) reason manifests itself: that old
undergraduate standby, “the plot.” As
long as we imprison the novel’s self-conscious symbolic order in the
terminological confines of “the plot,” this speculation (again, read as
ironically or unironically as is your wont) is not entirely invalid. However, its purview is so great, so broad
and simpleminded, that as speculations go, it is less than worthless. After all, every critical encounter with <em>The
Scarlet Letter</em> addresses this definition of “the plot” in some respect,
however idiosyncratic. Intellectual
honesty demands it. We must then
question whether the text itself explicates some thing or idea (thereby
attributing its articulation to the Author), or whether we, in our capacity as
literary critics, explicate it. If the
text itself is doing the explicating (on its face, a patently absurd idea), how
is it communicating these ideas to the reader? How does it articulate what it means? But if the literary critic undertakes the explication of the text, by
what standards are we to judge that explication’s legitimacy? Intellectual history provides us with an easy
answer to that second question: the explications of literary critics are judged
(and just as often, their generation is over-determined) by the dominant mode
of criticism in a given historical moment. The answer to the first question eludes me, although it possible
existence seems less patently absurd now than it did a few sentences ago.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And so we
begin this paragraph where we began the last, attempting to justify the
centrality of literature to literary criticism. The majority (and I say “majority” to distinguish the conclusions of my
“comprehensive” two-week search from the potentially different conclusions an
“exhaustive” two-week search might reach. Were the two one-and-the-same, I’d venture to claim that the “entirety”)
of secondary material on <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> presupposes the novel’s
importance, thus necessitating we distinguish between a great work of
literature and one which is merely important. To proclaim a work “great” implies an a-historical, transcendent
“greatness” inheres in the work itself, whereas proclaiming it “important”
merely indicates that a host of others have and do and will think it
“great.” Neither approach illuminates
much about the text itself, but at the very least, the idea of a work’s
importance (even if divorced from the conceptualization of its “greatness”)
provides an impetus for reading it. Otherwise, what reason is there for the voluminous amount of criticism
openly hostile to the work it addresses (or the opinions of the author as
inferred from that work)? If a work were
truly and inherently “great,” what reason could there possibly be to dislike
it? The easy answer to this is that some
people just don’t like “greatness.” But
if this answer doesn’t beg the question, I don’t know what does. How are we defining the quality of
“greatness” in a work? If the answer is
that someone or something assures of its “greatness,” we’d have to quantify
their criteria for “greatness,” and do we really think their non-answer will be
more quantifiable than ours? Probably
not, but despite the emptiness of the term, its circulation (both horizontally,
if you will, through a particular society in a particular historical moment,
and vertically, as it were, down through generations from its moment of
production to our own) assures us that we can validly consider it
“important.” From this, more questions
follow: what role does our consideration of a work’s importance play in
creating the illusion of its “greatness”? And if, metaphorically speaking, we as critics are speculators, what is
our gold standard? Do we even have one? Or are we no better than Peter
Goldwaite? (Goldwaite’s name becomes
more suggestive in this context: Goldwaite as “gold wait,” implying the
possible redemption of our paper bills; or is it Goldwaite as “gold wraithe,”
implying something about the abstract relation, as configured in this metaphor,
of a work’s “greatness” to its “importance.”) Cultural studies (at least in my caricature of it) impresses on us the
brilliance (quite the loaded term here) of the critical act as speculation: Who
needs a gold standard when such brilliant speculators abound? Who needs <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> when we
can come to identical conclusions by reading the transcript of Ann Hutchinson’s
trial? Sadly enough, I’m no closer to an
answer now than when I began this paragraph; at most, I’ve established the
importance of <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, and that functions as an adequate (though
by no means convincing) reason a re-reading of Hawthorne’s romance accompanies
the (monstrous?) birth of each new critical paradigm.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> But what
then are we to make of the fact that most of these re-readings still consider
the same thematic axial? From a
distance, there is uniformity to the situation I referred to earlier as being
“impossibly complex.” (No facile
allusion to chaos theory here; the distinction is analogous to the respective
perspectives of the private in the trenches and the binoculared general on a
distant hilltop. I know, I know, my
metaphor begs challenging. How,
precisely, did I acquire this perspective? To which I disingenuously reply, I have no conscious investment in any
particular methodology other than whichever one allows me to momentarily
repress my awareness of the illegitimacy of my metaphor.) I term this uniformity “a social history of
individual sin.” Critical paradigms
notwithstanding, the majority of the criticism contained in <em>The Scarlet
Letter</em>’s scholarly apparatus addresses the relation of an individual sin to
an individual sinner living under the strictures of the Puritan establishment.</p>

<p>A cursory
examination of the critical literature demonstrates the presence of this
thematic in the most disparate methodological approaches. In the cleverly titled “The New England
Sources of <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>” (AL 31:
257-72), published in 1959, Charles Ryskamp delivers a detailed explication of Hawthorne’s fastidious use
of historical sources. He characterizes Hawthorne’s historical
project as an attempt to imbue his fictional narrative with the authority of a
historical text. About Hawthorne’s
use of historical personages, Ryskamp claims “the fictional protagonists of the
action move and gain their being in part through their realistic meetings with
well-known people of colonial Boston.” Or, to rephrase this in the terminology I’ve
established, according to Ryskamp, Hawthorne situates his narrative within (what was, at the time, considered to be a
historically accurate) depiction of the Puritan social order to “support the
scenes of passion and punishment.” Here,
Ryskamp implicitly claims Hawthorne values the disjunction between the stern social order of the historical Puritan
establishment and Hester’s alternative moral order. I can hear Ryskamp’s valuation of the
historical as a higher order of narrativized reality than literary fiction when
he projects his own ideological leanings onto Hawthorne, who evinced a “steady
determination to make the romances of his imagination as real as the prison
house and the grave.” But how can a
fictional narrative compete with the materiality of the building? The implied answer is “through the
utilization of the historical record.” Ryskamp’s conception of the constitution of physical reality extends
farther than my contemporary one, encompassing not merely the building
historical events occurred in, but the events themselves. The one-to-one correspondence between the
historical reality of Puritan Boston and the severe social order in which Hawthorne situates his
narrative create a contrast that accentuates the thematic I have already
identified as being central to the secondary literature. (Were I more intellectually honest, I might
pause here and characterize my own critical methodology. I might historicize the critical move of
combing a text in search of ruptures, that moment where what I (pre-)conceive
as being the common strain in <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>’s secondary literature
bubbles to the surface of a critical essay with a markedly different
theoretical orientation and “betrays” this other author’s unconscious awareness
of the superiority of my critical enterprise. Of course, I would never articulate the purpose of my method so
directly, instead claiming that my awareness of these ruptures in this other
critic’s text is the result of my directed reading, because we’re all tired of
constantly having to kill our fathers, those benevolent figures we assist in
the reproduction of every time we read another always already obsolete
essay. Or, at the very least, we’re
tired of hearing about it. After all,
what kind of party pooper would harp about the blood on our hands when we’ve
recreated a brand new critical paradigm?)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Other
historical approaches, such as Joseph Schwartz’s “Three Aspects of Hawthorne’s Puritanism”
(NEQ, 36: 192-208), published in 1963, explicitly relate to my
directed/thematic reading of the secondary literature. Schwartz claims that “Hawthorne always felt that the religious
system of Puritanism was hard, cold, and confined; it was only the fervent
faith of firm believers that redeemed it at all.” Hawthorne’s
use of Puritanism thus created a tension between society and the exquisitely
complex emotional life of the individual. If we were to politicize that complexity, render its juxtaposition with
the Puritan social order in sectarian logic, we would find ourselves arguing
something similar to Michael J. Colacurcio’s argument in “Footsteps of Ann
Hutchinson: the Context of <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>” (ELH 39: Sept. 1972). In Colacurcio’s account, Hester’s individual
complexity implicates her sinful actions in the antinomian movement, because
“the extremes of public legalism seem to breed their antinomian opposite as if
by natural law,” thus making it impossible for Hester “to affirm the legitimacy
of her powerful sexual nature without also affirming total, anarchic spiritual
freedom” (of a sort anathema, if you’ll pardon my ecumenicalism, in the rigid
Puritan social order). </p>

<p></p>

<p>The old and
new historicism both assume “a social history of individual sin” to be <em>The
Scarlet Letter</em>’s central thematic, and therefore use it to underpin their
entire critical enterprise. But in a
real way, the proper response to my essay so far should be a resounding (All
together now!) “Duh.” How could
historically inclined critics not presuppose the primacy of social history in
their accounts of <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>? How could they not contextualize Hawthorne’s
romance and still respect themselves in the morning? Nina Baym, in a review of 1968’s body of Hawthorne criticism,
praises Nina Bayn for doing precisely that. Nina Baym, in what Nina Baym characterizes to as “a fresh reading of
this much-read book,” is impressed by her own dehistoricization and
secularization of <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>’s context in “Passion and Authority
in <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>” (NEQ 43: 209-30). Nina Baym recounts Nina Baym’s argues that Dimmesdale and Hester “feel
guilt to the extent that they have internalized the prohibitions of their
community, and no absolute moral issues are implicated in their ‘sin.’” Baym’s dehistoricization of the Puritan
social order is not a unique move, but one with a long critical history. Prominent examples include, at least in
theory, psychoanalytic readings, but to be fair to Fredrick Crews, his <em>The
Sins of the Father</em> doesn’t participate in this dismissal of history. However, Crews does that “if [he] were to say
in one sentence what <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> was ‘about’ … [he] would call it
a study in the unconscious interdependence of people who feed off one another’s
incompleteness in a society which encourages them to dissemble and burn
themselves away in secret.” The movement
into a psychoanalytic critical apparatus poses some problems for the historicist. For example, how exactly do the neuroses and
psychoses of early 20<sup>th</sup> century Austrians pertain to individuals in
17<sup>th</sup> Puritan Boston? (Freud’s
universalization of his conceptual apparatus, first by projecting it back to
the origins of Western Civilization (<em>IoD</em>), then by implicating it in the
discourse of scientific objectivity (<em>BtPP</em>, <em>E&amp;I</em>), does not
validate Crews approach. Full
disclosure: Then again, here I am talking about “ruptures” in the text.) Baym’s decontextualization seems the more
egregious of the two, because she replaces the framework of Puritan authority
with an a-historical, blandly generic society that is “repressive and
authoritarian in its nature, and condemns their act because of its passionate
and self-expressive essence.” (By comparison,
Kafka’s parables seem exemplars of literary realism.) </p>

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Because
this is becoming increasingly unwieldy (<em>The Casebook II: This Time, It’s
Historical</em>), let me quickly return to the issue I was discussing at the
onset of this essay. That is, if the
central theme in <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>’s critical apparatus is the social
history of individual sin, why read <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> at all? Why not analyze the transcripts of Ann
Hutchinson’s trial instead? Is it merely
because of the novel’s purported “importance”? Since I have the floor, I’ll fathom an answer: literature is synthetic,
and as such it engenders a mode of speculation of a category different from
that of the historical, political, or moral speculation. Thinking about the four offices of the scarlet
letter (historical, political, moral, aesthetic), we can imagine their
conflation as being representative of the literary text. Through this synthesis, the concrete is
rendered ambiguous, but to what end? To
be honest (that is, to resist polemics for the moment), it’s just more
fun. It’s more work, sure, but it’s
enjoyable work. I read about I.G.
Farben’s involvement with the Third Reich in history texts, but I didn’t enjoy
it. It was edifying alright, but not
productive of a sublime paranoia that dogged my heels for weeks. To be polemical again, we can gather two
sorts of information from this synthesis: 1) inferred information about the
author, and 2) information about the society in which such a synthesis would
occur. Of course, when the moment
depicted differs from the moment of production, we’re going to run into a
problem, unless we posit that the real issue is the author’s opinion on the
society in which such a synthesis would occur. The question then becomes, why would we value this particular human
being’s opinion so highly that we’d work to generate the kind of information we
could be spoon fed by a historical treatise? Is the answer that literature contains another kind of knowledge, that
one synthesis occurs, no one office can extricate itself from the mess without
retaining something of the others? Does
each infect/inflect the other? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not clear on what you&#39;re saying here. Does it involve you liking ass, or am I way off base on that?</p></span>

I wanted to inform Some Gay Guy who just left my apartment that thanks to his comments (and my damnable urge to provoke them), I'm now in the top 10 Google searches for: &quot;queer marketing disaster&quot; &quot;male intimacy&quot; &quot;queer bias in&quot; any book I've mentioned since I've started writing this thing I know, I know. You're probably not even home yet and I'm already mocking you. It's a long walk up a steep hill, however, so I have time for some more, well, complaining. I've noticed that an inordinate number of the hits from the various search engines are for &quot;cliffs+notes+herr+dispatches&quot; or &quot;cliffs+notes+mcewan&quot; or &quot;cliffs+notes+whatever+novel+biography+book+I've+read+recently&quot; and I'm beginning to wonder: Do the people responsible for Cliff's Notes send out spiders to collect information or are students so desperate for cheatin' material that they scour the 'net for hours looking for what they could've already written by the time they've tracked it down? EDIT: Someone just googled &quot;cliffs+notes+left+behind.&quot; Either one of my loyal readers wants to see my head explode while processing that or the world really is about to end.</span></a></div>

The sly but unsubtle hyperbole of &quot;Woe unto ye beetles of South America!&quot; is typical of the way Darwin interacted with the natural world; namely, as if it could understand him and, more tellingly, as if he assumed it could answer back. According to Browne, it spoke through the mountains of evidence in which Darwin would, after decades of meticulous research, begin to see the contours of his theory of natural selection. But what Browne really wants to hammer home is that while, for some people, the idea that &quot;evidence speaks&quot; is little more than inflated modesty, for Darwin it organized his every observation for the majority of his life. For example, Browne writes Flowers invited him to bury his head in their petals, guinea-pigs reproached him for finding them tasty. It was a shame to kill armadillos when they were &quot;so quiet.&quot; Sometimes the rocks themselves were like people, hiding their secrets or teasing him with gnomic clues. Thereafter, he gave human attributes to almost every species he met, including flatworms and beetles: a trait that blurred the dividing line between man and beast. (216) You can see where this claim's headed: blurring &quot;the dividing line between man and beast&quot; allowed him to apply Malthus' arguments on the populations of man to animals or to impute the instinctive behaviors of animals to man. One that wall fell, the door had opened and in walked the theory of natural selection. (But not through the door, what with the wall having already fallen there would've been no need. Or door. But as the British are liable to be, well, British under any and all circumstances, the theory of natural selection probably walked in approximately where the door had been, so that it might be greeted in the foyer.) But as compelling and intelligent as Browne's book has been--I'm a little more than two-thirds of the way through the first volume, sounding the waters around the Galapagos Island of Indefatigable, that is, east of Duncan, south of James, and north of Charles, Barrington and Chatham--I'm unsatisfied with this telegraphed epiphanic logic. I know from Darwin's account that he'll soon be tormenting large iguanas: I watched one for a long time, till half its body was buried; I then walked up and pulled it by the tail, at this it was greatly astonished, and soon shuffled up to see what was the matter; and then stared me in the face, much as to say, What made you pull my tail? Browne's claim of anthropomorphism is inadequate. It's not that Darwin believes the entire world is human, no, he believes the entire world is British. His treatment of the metaphorical subjects of the Queen is therefore doubly deplorable. Of tormenting another iguana,...</span></a></div>
