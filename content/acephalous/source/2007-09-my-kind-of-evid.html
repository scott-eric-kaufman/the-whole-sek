        <meta name="description" content="In his 1987 bestseller A History of the Jews, Paul Johnson claims the story of Moses must be true because it is &quot;beyond the power of the human mind to invent&quot; (27). The preceding sentence is instructive: That is why the contention of Wellhausen and his school that Moses was a later fiction and the Mosaic code a fabrication of the post-Exilic priests in the second half of the first millennium BC—a view still held by some historians today—is skepticism carried to the point of fanaticism, a vandalizing of the historical record. The historical record, then, consists of material too outlandish to invent, the likes of which only a fanatic would challenge.

This odd logic obtains despite the fact that, as Edward Said discusses in &quot;Invention, Memory, and Place&quot; (2000), Jewish historians are well-aware of the purposes to which Jewish history has been deliberately put: In her 1995 book Recovered Roots: Collective Memory and the Making of an Israeli National Tradition, the Israeli-American historian Yael Zerubavel shows how before the late nineteenth century the story of Masada was unknown to most Jews. Then in 1862 a Hebrew translation of the Roman sources of Masada in Josephus's War of the Jews was published, and in a short time the story was transformed by reconstruction into four important things: &quot;a major turning point in Jewish history, a locus of modern pilgrimage, a famous archaeological site, and a contemporary political metaphor&quot; (63). So another story &quot;beyond the power of the human mind to invent&quot; must also be true, again on the basis of its outlandishness, only now everyone knows the fix is on. General Yigael Yadin excavates Masada in 1948, finds no compelling proof that a mass-suicide didn't occur, then declares that it did. And people believe him. Despite how it looks, this must be a compelling argument: Concoct something unbelievable. Locate a place in which no evidence of the unbelievable event can be found. Declare the absence of evidence proves the unbelievable occurred because it cannot be disproved. I think I'm going to wander back north and see what evidence I can't find. I know I should have my outlandish claims prepared before I leave, but that's what's so wonderful about this methodology: I need only concoct something outlandish enough there's little chance any relevant evidence (contradictory or otherwise) will ever be found.

		<span id="comment-82380375-content"><p>I loved reading Josephus (in translation); he&#39;s probably my favorite historian.  And I got a completely different series of lessons about how to survive as a Jew than every other Jew seems to have.</p>

<p>Lesson #1: The survivors write the histories.</p>

<p>You know all those people who supposedly killed themselves at Masada?  (Let&#39;s assume that they did.)  We aren&#39;t descended from them -- they had no descendents.  We&#39;re descended from people like Josephus, who did whatever he had to do to make it through.  No one should admire those people.</p>

<p>Lesson #2: Fanatics are stupid.</p>

<p>Remember the scene where Josephus&#39; twenty-person bodyguard (or something) says that they all have to kill themselves now that the Romans have won, and they&#39;ll kill Jospephus if he runs?  He says, OK, we&#39;ll all draw lots to see who kills who first until we&#39;re all gone.  And then of course he palms the long lot, or something, to manipulate the system until only him and one other less-fanatic guy are left.  Then he asks the less-fanatic guy, do you really want to kill each other?  The answer&#39;s no; they go surrender to the Romans, leaving the other 18 dead.</p>

<p>Lesson #3: People in power are gullible and easily flattered.</p>

<p>So Josephus has been captured, and he&#39;s going to get the usual Roman treatment for captured enemy generals, which I imagine involves being paraded around, then crucifiction or something.  He goes up to the Roman general and says, hey, I have prophetic dreams, and I see that you&#39;re going to become Emperor of Rome!  So the general instead puts Josephus in jail for the moment, as a sort of flattering good luck charm, and then the general (as was not uncommon) uses his successful generalship to become Emperor of Rome, frees Josephus, and makes him rich.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-82862481-content"><p>This reminds me of an article I read years ago on Elizabeth Bishop&#39;s lesbian poetics.  The argument was, basically, that despite Bishop&#39;s letters and journal entries in which she says that to write about one&#39;s intimate sexual life is gauche (which the writer of the article included excerpts from), this recurring theme of absences and voids in her poems is surely a signifier of precisely that life, in a presence-of-absence=absent-presence sort of way.  I thought at the time, Huh?  But now, seeing that Johnson--and Freud--engaged in this same sort of shell-game, I now belatedly realize I&#39;ve wasted a whole lot of time in libraries.</p></span>

VT quarterback Sean Glennon is having problems concentrating in the huddle ... not because of the 90,000 rabid LSU fans screaming at him, and not because he's facing the best defense in the nation, but because he can never rid himself of the memories of that tragic day. He prays to God someday he will, but that day is not today, as he looks completely out-thought and over-matched by this LSU defense. Meanwhile, God—paying very close attention to this game—has decided that the 1,800 people killed by his hurricane need mourning far more than the mere thirty-two people Seung-Hui Cho murdered before taking his own life. Of course, it's only the end of the first quarter, and He may change His mind. UPDATE: The Lord can count, apparently, and He feels worse about Katrina. LSU up twenty-four to nothing. Geaux Tigers. UPDATE II: Three LSU linemen weighing a collective 900 lbs. stitched the Virginia Tech players a memorial quilt. We all know how God feels about blankets. Geaux Tigers. *Lest the hate-mail stream in: I'm not mocking anyone except the announcers here. They've obviously been told to be &quot;reverent&quot; and are trying their best ... but their best entails turning a football game into a theological disquisition on the God's will delivered with all the complexity of freshmen who've hit more bongs than books.</span></a></div>
