				<p>CFP: The Cultural Logic of Brad Pitt</p>

<p>For the 2005 Western Literature Association Conference in Los Angeles, we plan to organize a panel on the film icon, Brad Pitt. Why Brad Pitt?</p>

<p>As one of this generation's most popular actors, Pitt has explored many of the cultural tensions of our emerging postmodern era. Depicting masculine American whiteness in various states of crisis, his characters generally enact complex postmodern agencies; they are never wholly coherent, they are often self-destructive, and they generally rely on a certain amount of play--between stability and instability, between life and death, between autonomy and alter-dependency, between control and abandon. Simultaneously reifying and challenging hegemonic codes of race, class, gender, and regional or national identity, his characters explore the complex and changing postmodern cultural landscape. Tracing his performances through a variety of films and theoretical texts we hope to explain Brad Pitt's multi-dimensional postmodernity by exploring: 1) the cultural logic of his performances, showing how they dramatize postmodern cultural tensions, and 2) the kind of cultural or political work that his performances accomplish, or the difference that they make and the impact that they have on the audiences who watch them.</p>

<p>Some of the kinds of issues that we hope to explore include:</p>

<p>* Brad Pitt's West: From A River Runs Through It and Legends of the Fall to Thelma and Louise and Kalifornia, many of Pitt's performances explore the physical and cultural landscapes of the American West? How do Pitt's performances both reenact and revise more traditional western narratives and identities?</p>

<p>* Brad Pitt's postmodern subjectivity: How do Pitt's performances, especially in films such as Fight Club and 12 Monkeys, explore new postmodern constructions of race, class, gender, and national identity?&nbsp; What makes these characters compelling or illuminating for contemporary audiences, and what do they tell us about how American culture is changing in response to new postmodern economic and historical contexts?</p>

<p>* Marketing Brad Pitt: While Brad Pitt has clearly emerged as a mainstream Hollywood star and box-office favorite, his characters frequently bristle with an undeniably rebellious and countercultural energy? But do his characters really explore radical or marginal locations outside the boundaries of the dominant culture, or are they only pseudo-revolutionaries-posing as rebels, but ultimately conforming to privileged, white, male, heterosexual, and American cultural norms? What do his performances teach us about the complex relationship between the culture and the countercultures of the postmodern, especially in the popular media? How is his revolutionary persona used as a marketing device to sell movies and/or postmodern culture?</p>

		<span id="comment-5512098-content"><p>This cfp annoyed me too.  More generally, have you noticed how roughly 75% of the cfps that come up concern some totally bullshitty topic?  Is it just the academic nut-jobs who write these things?  Do the non-nut-jobs team up for panels on their own, because they&#39;re afraid of the nut-job proposals they&#39;d receive if they posted on the cfp list serve?  I wish our mutual advisor would put us in contact with those other non-nut-jobs.</p></span>

<p>Even if I saw that panel at the SCMS (Society for Cinema &amp; Media Studies) Conference--where it might arguably more belong--I would avoid it like a trip to the dentist. Sadly, it&#39;s possible that individual papers submitted to that panel may be quite good, but the &quot;logic&quot; of the panel itself and how the terms of inquiry are laid out are very much what I am trying to avoid in my scholarship. </p></span>

All 38 are believed to be known associates of the Cultural Logic of Brad Pitt Cartel. Authorities have not yet released the cause of death, but preliminary reports indicate they were shot with a large-caliber handgun sometime around 1:17 p.m. on the afternoon of May 8th. Although no suspects are in custody, APD Police Chief Roger Wilco believes the case will be resolved quickly. &quot;This is a small town. Everybody knows everybody else,&quot; he said. &quot;Sooner or later something will turn up.&quot;</span></a></div>
