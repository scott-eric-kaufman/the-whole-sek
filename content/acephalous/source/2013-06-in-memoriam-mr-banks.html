Banks</strong> Not that it's unexpected, but all signs point to Iain M. Banks having lost his battle with cancer this morning. I am, for the record, allowed to mourn his passing without conservative self-promoters like John Ziegler attacking me for falsely lionizing the recently deceased. Should he or any like-minded asshole try any such thing, I have no doubt he'll feel the full force of the online equivalent of Special Circumstances. I'll write a Banks a proper send-off once I gather my thoughts, but for now, I'll acknowledge we've lost a great one and leave it at that.</span></a></div>

From here continue to: The second of the so-called “Game of LASER TAG: ‘Then you’ll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock,’” concerns the gratifying results created by the tapestry of eyelines MacClaren established early in the episode. Then we moved on to “The Rains of Castamere” podcast, in which Steven and I disagreed about when the titular song begins. Then, in my first post on the subject, I noted that the eyelines — lasers or no lasers — align in a manner that should (and does) cause suspicion among the guests, foremost among them Catelyn Stark. I almost discuss when the song begins, but then I don’t. I covered that in my final post on “The Rains of Castamere,” in which I defined all the minor elements of Aristotelian tragedy before demonstrating the order and manner in which they cause the maximum amount of pain and keening. I hope this is less confusing. I know when material’s cross-linked and back-dated and newer posts appear before older ones that I sometimes find myself befuddled. There’s no shame in that. Or if there is, take heart in knowing I share it.</span></a></div>
