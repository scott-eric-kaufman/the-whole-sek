Most students of the humanities encounter bovarysme (if they encounter it at all) in T.S. Eliot's &quot;Shakespeare and the Stoicism of Seneca.&quot; Eliot argues that Othello &quot;succeeds in turning himself into a pathetic figure, by adopting an aesthetic rather than a moral attitude, dramatising himself against his environment.&quot; He doesn't &quot;believe that any writer has ever exposed this bovarysme, the human will to see things as they are not, more clearly than Shakespeare.&quot; Hannah Arendt would disagree. In Eichmann in Jerusalem (1963) she notes how rare it is to find documents in which such bald words as &quot;extermination,&quot; &quot;liquidation,&quot; or &quot;killing&quot; occur. The prescribed code names for killing were &quot;final solution,&quot; &quot;evacuation&quot; (Aussiedlung ), and &quot;special treatment&quot; (Sonderbehandlung). This language sounds euphemistic for good reason. Because we want Nazis to be responsible for the Holocaust we must read them as being euphemisms. If they aren't euphemisms—if the average Nazi believed that he was implementing &quot;the final solution&quot; instead of ordering an &quot;extermination&quot;—then their culpability can be questioned. The state bovarysme describes is one of complete mystification. The victims of the so-called will-to-illusion never see the despoiled forest for the haggard trees. Or even the haggard trees. They see fields of blooming poppies just begging for a good hard frolicking. They see puppies prancing with kittens cavorting with bunnies bouncing alongside wee little chicks. Such people aren't (and can't be) culpable in the way we want Eichmann culpable. The extent of self-deception exonerates the bovaryste of serial euphemism. What prevents bovarysme from being incorporated into a more thoroughgoing conception of ideology? The mystification of the bovaryste may be as powerful as any ideological mystification this side of the faded and flagging Iron Curtain, but it lacks the systemic kick of old school ideological interpellation (sans Lacan). What fascinates me about this particular fashionable philosophical position is that it appeals to anyone who wants to fool themselves so thoroughly as to forget they've ever fooled themselves of anything. They believe the lie not because they want to but because they've forgotten they lied to themselves. Why do I mention this tonight? Do I have some political point I'm desperate to make? No. I mention it because Jonathan and Rich were having a fascinating discussion about the merits of Gene Wolfe and I wanted to feel like a contributer to this blog. Since I haven't read the novels they're discussing in more than five years I felt I could best contribute by pointing out the aspect of Wolfe's The Fifth Head of Cerberus I found most fascinating aligns neatly with a turn-of-the-century philosophical fad I also find fascinating.

		<span id="comment-9601108-content"><p>I suppose I meant &quot;(sans Lacan by way of sans Althusser),&quot; but I&#39;m a sucker for assonance...and there <i>is</i> a way in which interpellation minus Lacan approximates commonplace ideological mystification.  Plus I&#39;d already said &quot;mystification&quot; twice and desperately needed another word and, having run plum out of &#39;em, I grasped for interpellation and qualifed.  I suppose &quot;san Althusser&quot; could work, but there&#39;s something plainer and more inaccurate about the sweet musicality of &quot;sans Lacan.&quot;</p>

<p>That said, you didn&#39;t correct me on my French, which means those eight years <i>weren&#39;t wasted</i> thank-you-very-much-Madame-LaFleur!</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/this_will_have_.html"><span><strong>This Will Have Been the Poem Post; or, Anti-Socialist Doggerel and the London Scholars Amused by It</strong> I'm not normally a fan of poetry—some sapiens whose fallow fields ain't all too fallow are born into ambiguity and live contentedly &quot;within&quot; the ken of such conveniently aesthetic interpretations their whole life long .... but seeing how I ain't numbered 'mong them this ought to ring truer than the Virgin's very own words—so I hereby proclaim that even infides like I find the following doggerel infinitely entertaining. (Consider that your special stamp o' approval.) It is called &quot;Mother Jones Melodies&quot; and comes from the 18 April 1906 issue of the wildly popular satirical Puck Magazine. To contextualize this moment a bit, this poem and its corresponding cartoon would've been in print shortly after Jack London (already wildly successful and widely scorned for The People of the Abyss and a lecture-circuit-sensation) published his revolutionary socialist novel The Iron Heel and Upton Sinclar (ever the practical man) had published his muckraking of the meat-packing industry, The Jungle. I mention the latter because it sits upon the desk in the cartoon (immediately to the left of the hoppin' mad elfin figure who represents .... someone?) and the former because its composition and publication are (in London's mind) integral to his vacation on the Isle of British Poverty (recounted in The People of the Abyss). But you're not interested in all this dry dusty history! On to the poem! The &quot;poem&quot; (subtitled &quot;For the Kindergarten School of Socialists&quot;) reads: Pussy Cat, Pussy Cat, where have you been? I've been to Jack London to hark to his chin. Pussy Cat, Pussy Cat, what did he say? &quot;Blow h—l out of everything—smash, burn and slay!&quot; Not that London would not have said that (or much, much worse, by which I mean yelling &quot;EVERYTHING IS FINE! RETURN TO YOUR SEATS!&quot; in a burning theater). And not that London wouldn't have juxtaposed it for maximum effect, as this author unwittingly does in his or her sad shot at satire. What London never would have done was jump up and down and wave his arms and stamp his feet and let a cat—because if ever a man was a dog or wolf man, Jack London was a dog or a wolf man—tell him what someone as important as Jack London had said. London knew better than to trust a cat. Cats lie. They claim to have not been fed when they can hardly stand for belly-bulge. They claim to have no water when the bowl (which is not the slowly dripping bathroom tap) overbrims with fresh filtered water. London knew better than to allow a cat even one all gussied up in stripes and scarves to tell him the who-for or what-not. My point? You want my point?!? Were I not bound the by strictures of the Dissertators' Code I would have to admit that that cartoon and its accompanying nursery rhyme are damn funny.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/since_i_couldnt.html"><span><strong>On The MLA, Google Blog Search, the OED and The Lord's Perfect Game</strong> Since I couldn't very well incorporate these thoughts into the prior post: I will be attending the MLA this year. Everyone I've met here who will be there should sit down somewhere and have some beers. I hear Edmund Wilson also wanted to spend the convention on a bender. Why not help make his dream our reality? (Shout out in the comment section or send me an email.) Since Google unveiled Google Blog Search this humble blog has been oogled by oodles of googlers desperately seeking gossip about themselves. I have more hits by Vanity Googlers in the past three days than I've had since I opened Acephalous. I can only imagine that—having seen the short spot on Google Blog Search on CNN this weekend—they thought that everyone they have ever met in their entire lives has probably published something about them on their respective blogs. Desperate to gain entry to the Great Halls of Gossip they beseeched the Gods of Google for guidance .... only to end up here. Someone finally informed the editors of the online edition of The Oxford English Dictionary that a search algorithm which can shuttle even chronic misspellers to the promised land would be an excellent way to circumvent the paradox dogging American schoolchildren: If I knew how to spell it I wouldn't have to look it up in the dictionary! They still ought to code it such that it don't crash when people look up &quot;algorhythm.&quot; (That is a blank screen you see. That is my point. Compare it &quot;algorithm.&quot;) I hear thunder. I see lightening. I live in Southern California. (sings) One of these things is not like the other. One of these things is just not the same. (sheepishly ceases) What I mean to say is that outside my window it is thundering something so fierce even the Louisianians swear the Lord aims to bowl Hisself 300.</span></a></div>
