			<p>&quot;Scott's Dissertation&quot; is the name of a folder on my desktop.&nbsp; Has been for the past three years.&nbsp; When I migrated my files from my laptop, I copied &quot;Scott's Dissertation&quot; to the external hard drive (<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/06.jpg">a.k.a.</a>); then I copied it from the external hard drive (<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/06.jpg">a.k.a.</a>) to my my new desktop.&nbsp; I assumed my new &quot;Scott's Dissertation&quot; folder would contain all the files and folders housed in the old one.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It doesn't.&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>This post makes me hungry.</em></p>

<p>TIN CANS DON&#39;T FRAKKIN&#39; EAT.</p>

<p>Ari:</p>

<p><em>Thanks for the anxiety. I really needed it.</em></p>

<p>You make me cry, I make you worry.  It&#39;s only fair.</p>

<p>Luther:</p>

<p><em>Always email your chapter drafts to yourself and your loved ones. </em></p>

<p>I&#39;ve sent emails out to people I&#39;m pretty sure have copies of it, so I think I&#39;m safe ... just insecure for the moment.  The thing is, I finished the introduction so long ago -- it&#39;s a primer on Spencer/Darwin and the influence of evolutionary thought, bits of which get worked into all my other chapters -- that I didn&#39;t have Gmail at the time.  (<em>Gawd</em>, I&#39;ve been at this that long.)</p>

<p><em>twenty versions of every chapter, all called things like &quot;Morrison chapter&quot; or &quot;Harris chapter.&quot;</em> </p>

<p>Every one of my chapters has a name and a designation, like &quot;Wharton 7.61.&quot;  (Not kidding about that either.  Actual chapter draft name there.)  But my first chapter, well, it&#39;s <em>vanished</em>.  It&#39;ll reappear soon, I&#39;m sure.  </p>

<p>(Or violence.)</p>

<p>(Violence galore.)</p>

<p><em>Also: can turtledoves --- aka lovebirds --- be irate?</em></p>

<p>Have you ever had one stare you down, murder in its eyes, seeds on its mind?  <em>Didn&#39;t think so</em>.  You partridge in your pear tree all you&#39;d like, there&#39;s no escaping the wrath of starving lovebirds ...</p></span>

<p>Very sorry to hear about the chapter. </p>

<p>[I&#39;m going to assume you&#39;ve already done this, but it might be worth it: have you done a thorough search of places the chapter folder should <i>not</i> be? I ask this because it&#39;s shockingly easy, in the drag and drop process, to relocate a folder within a drive without meaning to, and the relocation process is so quick, you can not realize what you&#39;ve done until later.]</p></span>

<p><em>I ask this because it&#39;s shockingly easy, in the drag and drop process, to relocate a folder within a drive without meaning to, and the relocation process is so quick, you can not realize what you&#39;ve done until later.</em> </p>

<p>Right now, I&#39;ve installed Google Desktop and it&#39;s scanning my hard drive ... but since it&#39;s 500 gigs and overstuffed with ebooks, it&#39;s going to take a while.  (Four days, according to its estimate.)  But I&#39;ve been searching in all the places it might&#39;ve landed -- the problem is, as you say, I probably dropped it in one of my five hundred thousand music folders.  (Stupid legacy of iTunes&#39;s &quot;organizational&quot; structure.)</p>

<p>Naadir:</p>

<p><em>All I can say is foldershare.com.</em></p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen that before ... must learn how to use.  </p>

<p>Emerson:</p>

<p><em>So I rename one file &quot;Introduction best version&quot;. Then finally I just start dating everything in the filename. But then I sometimes forget. And I may still may have a few old files on 5 1/4&quot; Wordstar floppies. Or on harddrives in landfills somewhere.</em></p>

<p>I rename stuff like that, but the problem is I end up with eighteen files ambiguously named &quot;Introduction - Best Version 4.3,&quot; &quot;Introduction - Best Version FOR REAL 9.1,&quot; &amp;c.  </p>

<p>And I&#39;ll see your Wordstar and raise you Leading Edge Word Processor documents.  My old LEWP files require an emulator to run ... but the emulator&#39;s based on Windows 95, so now I have to run a Windows 95 emulator session in Vista in order to run my LEWP emulator.  (And no, the files won&#39;t convert, damn it, and I don&#39;t want to lose all my pre-undergraduate noodling.)</p>

<p>Martin:</p>

<p><em>Yes, search your hard drive for the file name, see if it turns up.</em></p>

<p>The Windows search function is, shall we say, not all that functional.  The damnable beast crashes <em>every single time</em>.  I wish I&#39;d bought a Mac.  (Not really, but you know what I mean.)  </p>

<p>Read:</p>

<p>You know what&#39;d be nice to have in my head?  An unkillable, damn-near omniscient Cyclon.  If it could help Gaius compromise Caprica&#39;s security grid -- WARNING! THAT WAS A SPOILER, BUT IF IT SPOILED ANYTHING, THIS POST PROBABLY MADE NO SENSE, SO NEVERMIND -- surely Seven could help me finish my dissertation.  I mean, she&#39;s got to read faster than me, right?</p>

<p>Belle:</p>

<p>No, the Cylon&#39;s not allowed on the Internet ... but as you can tell, that hasn&#39;t stopped it from doing so.</p>

<p>Doomed.  We&#39;re all doomed.</p></span>

<p>Can your Cylon subdue spies and terrorists as well? Audience testing proves that eating book chapters is awfully glamorous; catching criminals, though, makes for a catchier plot. I know you probably want to play yourself in the movie, but, no disrespect intended, I think we need someone who is TV pretty.  </p>

On the portable drive it was in that folder. On new desktop it is not in that folder. Where is it? I ate it. It was there but I ate it. Did you need it for something? Hope not because I ate it. Why would I not eat it? It was there so I ate it. Should I have eaten it? Probably not but it was there so I ate it. Will I eat it again? Probably if it is there I will eat it. You would eat it too if it was there. Why hold me to higher standards? Turtledove attack. Sill obscured by mob of irate turtledoves. Window not thick enough to withstand turtledove assault. Bulwark with something handy. Books? Edibles? Cats? Can you eat turtledoves they are there. Are they not there? You complain about what is not there. Why not accept what is? Turtledoves are there. Need chapter not birds. Birds not acceptable. Professors laugh when you turn in birds. Search committees consider incomplete birds unacceptable. Jobs not won on strength of birds. Annotated birds? Plagiarized? Nonsense. Need chapter. Birds unacceptable. You defend with the dissertation you have not the dissertation you want. (Or with birds.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/02/michelle-obamas.html"><span><strong>Michelle Obama's Senior Thesis: Representative, though not as Embarrassing as Mine, Damn It</strong> Travis Kavulla has some &quot;Thoughts on Michelle Obama's Thesis.&quot; As his title suggests, they are neither smart nor sound thoughts: they are merely thoughts. Kavulla is not a dumb man. He may even be a nice man. So I grant, for the moment, that his thoughts on Michelle's Obama's thesis represent neither his mind nor his character; because if they did, they would speak quite poorly of both. First and foremost, the object of his critique is an undergraduate thesis. It is not written deliberately—with the care a graduate student would write a seminar paper or a law student compose a sample brief—but in bursts of research crammed in between unrelated coursework. (No scholar works on a paper while simultaneously trying to master studentized range distributions and Bowen's reaction series.*) So undergraduate theses tend to resemble fun-house reflections of their committee's interests. For example, remember my undergraduate thesis? Were someone to dredge it up when my wife went up for tenure on the assumption it reflected my current beliefs and standards, I would dismiss them as frivolous. My senior thesis is the product of an immature mind warping John Protevi's passion for continental philosophy into an embarrassing melange of big words and bad ideas. Like any successful undergraduate, I could outline [.pdf] other people's thoughts but had problems generating any of my own. So I did what every undergraduate does: I mimicked. I experimented. I minced the careful prose of my betters until it emitted a fragrance I thought odoriferous, everyone else odorous. But I've changed. In the years since I wrote my undergraduate thesis, I've learned how to parrot the conventions of my betters more convincingly, and that research consists of more than finding a theory that conveniently accounts for what I've already determined to be very important facts. In short, I've honed the skills I once wielded with all the subtlety of toddler with a broadsword. Now for the ironic part: I'd still be an oversized infant struggling to hack with a sword twice as wide as he was tall were it not for one of Kavulla's co-bloggers. When I first arrived in Irvine, I talked BIG TALK. I impressed people with my manifest impressiveness. One day, after witnessing me conquer fellow graduate students in an after-seminar bull-session, a fellow by the name of Jim Zeigler pulled me aside and recommended I read Mark Bauerlein's Literary Criticism: An Autopsy. I was humbled. Not that I agreed (or agree) with Bauerlein, but the idea that someone was challenging the theoretical orthodoxy I'd come to believe sacred was exactly the corrective I needed. I'd uncritically embraced post-modern/post-structuralist theory as an undergraduate and needed some distance. I needed to read something like this: [&quot;Discourse&quot;] has a loaded meaning, but a vague referent, and the vagueness is necessary to this mode of inquiry. In using it, critics can attenuate their descriptions, yet still sound authoritative. &quot;Discourse&quot; usage converts a methodological weakness into a theoretical exigency. &quot;Discourse&quot; is an essential constituent of inquiry,...</span></a></div>
