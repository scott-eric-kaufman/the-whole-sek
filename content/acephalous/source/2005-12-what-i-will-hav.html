		<span id="comment-12112351-content"><p>You&#39;re going to casually learn Adobe InDesign?  You are either delusional or highly gifted.  Or have previous desktop publishing software experience, I guess.  I can&#39;t even figure out how to put pictures into OpenOffice and get them to come out the right size.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been playing around for a while now trying to get a book with pictures in it together for Lulu.com publication.  Each time I come back to it I quickly realize that learning how to format the thing is going to take the same kind of energy as work does (which commenting on blogs, clearly, does not) and therefore take tremendous amounts of time that could be spent helping people figure out which pollutants from military bases are getting into groundwater or something.  I could pay someone to do it, but $400 or so while in theory affordable seems like overkill for the 6 copies of the book that I expect to &quot;sell&quot;.  So I&#39;m stuck.  If anyone out there has any advice (free or cheap software plus really good tutorial, perhaps?), please feel free.</p></span>

Or have a social life.  Or don&#39;t have a wife whose salary equals yours.  Or don&#39;t have and/or want children.  Or health insurance.  Or a working car.  </p>

<p>Seriously, all you whiners piss me off.</p>

<p>Rich, I didn&#39;t say I would &quot;casually&quot; learn InDesign.  I said I&#39;d learn it.  Nothing casual about it.  Check its tome out of the library.  Sit down and spend an hour a day working through it chapter by chapter.  Eventually finish it and have an idea how to work the basics.  Build on that.  I am a quick study with computer programs, however, so I think I&#39;ll be able to whip <i>something</i> up in a month.  We&#39;ll see.  Feel free to point and laugh when I fail.</p></span>

I think we should <i>flunk Ed</i>.  Perhaps one is more acceptable to MLA panellists than the other?  Although it seems to me that academics presenting at the MLA should be grateful that anybody is reading their stuff at all.</p>

<p>Me: I plan to spend this vacation staging my suicide from a snow-bound bridge so as to tempt down my guardian angel so he can show me how things in London (and the London area) would have worked out had I never been born.  I&#39;m curious, that&#39;s all.<br />

Kelly&#39;s going to bang some pots and pans by her head tomorrow.  If that fails, we&#39;re going to throw her in the tub then dump a toaster in there.  </p>

<p>Adam, I didn&#39;t realize <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361227/" rel="nofollow">Ashton Kutchor</a> a solely American phenomenon.  How long does it take to cross that ocean, anyway?  Are your comments like the light from long dead stars, having journeyed millions of years over an unimaginable abyss to reach me?  </p>

<p>The Google link to the Wikipedia page raises some interesting usage questions:</p>

<blockquote>The show has spawned the catchphrase &quot;You just got punk&#39;d&quot; ... The victim will then say to the camera &quot;I&#39;ve just been punk&#39;d&quot;.</blockquote>

<p>Jonathan, I&#39;m sorry, but the people have declared in one voice that &quot;punk&quot; is a verb.  And by &quot;people&quot; I mean &quot;Ezra Pound&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>You lay back, you let me have the whole stinking sweat of providing the mechanical means for letting through the new movement... Then you punk out, cursing me for not being in two places at once, and for ‘seeing no alternative to my own groove’.</blockquote></span>

<p>Part of this stems from my years as a linguistics major, toiling away at descriptive grammar and learning to love the evolution of language.  I don&#39;t mind if &quot;punk&quot; verbifies into an intransitive.  In fact, I love it.  I verb all the time, and I wager Jonathan does to . . . he&#39;s just too high and mighty to allow a <i>popular</i> verbed noun enter the lexicon.  </p></span>

For seven reasons. Once I styled myself a poet. At the time I only read comic books so my poems had an uncanny amount of spandex in them. But I matured. In the year of nineteen-hundred and ninety-five I wrote &quot;A Jew Speaks of Joan Rivers.&quot; I consider it my best work. Be kind.* I’ve known Joan Rivers: I’ve known Rivers, ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins. My soul has grown shallow like Joan Rivers. I bathed in the Euphrates when Melissa was young. I built my house near Hollywood Hills and Joan bored me to death. I looked upon Joan and raised Melissa above her. I heard the squawking of the Rivers when Gwyneth Paltrow went down to accept her Emmy, and so I’ve seen her death-pale bosom heave in that ill-fitting dress. I’ve known the Rivers. The ancient, chalky Rivers. My soul has grown shallow like the Rivers. *By which I mean flatter me now for my stupidity then. Because I did write that in 1995. I've resisted the urge to &quot;improve&quot; it. I teach journalism after all. I fight for the interests of accuracy. Scratch that. I teach literary journalism and value accuracy. Much better.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/12/stereoscopic_po.html"><span><strong>Stereoscopic Poetry; or, How the Near-Deaf Focus on Words</strong> Because I have less than no time to post tonight, I present you with interesting facts about my life culled from other places: I’m a certifiably strange listener of poetry, since when I attend readings I’m reading the poet’s lips as much as I’m listening to auditory cues. When I listen to recordings, however, I have to do so with the text memorized or in front of me, which means that my eyes are keyed to the words and my ears to the rhythm. Then there’s the article a doctor-friend of mine sent me a while back about the way children with severe hearing loss during early childhood (I was stone deaf until corrective surgery at two or three) end up with brains wired to handle language differently. From what I understand, there’s no demonstrable influence on my communication skills, only on the parts of the brain responsible for them. I can’t remember which parts, but I know the way I experience sound is different from the way other people do. For example, I “hear” noises in people’s voices that other people’s brains filter out, so what I hear when an ordinary person speaks isn’t what you hear. All of which is mere preface to this: When I listen to poetry I have the distinct impression that I’m not listening to human speech; the rhythms, the way the mouth moves, the noises other people’s brains filter out all combine to create the distinct impression that I’m listening to something speech-like, but not actual language. I have to work to snap the sounds back into language, much like when one stares at one of those magic eye stereograms--it clicks for a moment, then I have to “refocus” and it does again, ad infinitum. In other words, I could describe my experience listening to poetry to other people, but I’m not sure it’d be relevent in any meaningful way. The agonzing complement to this story can be read on Michael's blog so long as you don't mind scrolling down. (I would copy and paste it too but you should read Michael's post before reading my comment.) One day I'll take Matt and Ray's advice and place my life somewhere prestigious. For now I'll settle for snagging it when time is tight so readers don't forget about this humble blog as they celebrate the season.</span></a></div>
