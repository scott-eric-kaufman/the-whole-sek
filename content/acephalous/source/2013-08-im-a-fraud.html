        <meta name="description" content="I don’t want to steal anyone’s thunder or appear to be piling on, but one aspect of Hugo Schyzer’s “confession” strikes me as especially problematic, especially at a time in which the humanities are under assault from well-funded conservative forces: his claim of academic fraudulence. He’s clearly not a fraud in the traditional sense, i.e. he didn’t falsify his credentials or publish papers on data he knew to be cooked. He claims that when he was in graduate school, “there was no such thing as porn studies,” so he lacked the credentials to teach it. Which, I suppose, is technically true. But he also claims to have “do[ne] the reading,” which in practice is all that’s required of scholars who work in a field that didn’t exist when they earned their doctorates. The other “fraud” he believes he committed is that he spoke about feminism but “never published in any serious academic journal [because he] wanted to write for a popular audience.” Anyone familiar with the current state of academic journals knows about the incestuous nature of “blind” review: your name’s not on your submission, but if you’ve spoken at a conference or to another scholar in the field, you’re a known quantity. Your work whispers your name to the person who reviews it and that, as much as any independent factors, determines whether it’ll be published. (Why yes, I am that cynical.) But I haven’t come here to bury humanities journals—their “style” secures them a place in the deepest recesses of empty libraries—only to note that failure to publish in a discipline or subdiscipline doesn’t disqualify a person from teaching in it if they’ve done the reading. That’s all that’s required. If Schwyzer convinced his colleagues that he’d done the reading, he was qualified to teach a course in whatever it was he’d read. Does this system require trust and lend itself to abuse? I suppose. But as someone who spent 13 years teaching at one of the best universities in the country, I can assure you that when you stand in front of a classroom of bright, motivated students you always feel like a fraud. You’ve never read enough, and you never will have. Your shelves will always be lined with books you should’ve already read. You feel like a fraud because you’ve only read thirty books on X, but your students consider you an authority for the very same reason. Was I a hypocrite when I taught a literary journalism course after only having casually read Joan Didion, Hunter S. Thompson, Tom Wolfe, and John McPhee? What if I told you I’d also had a subscription to The New Yorker for a decade? How much literary journalism did I need to read to be able to teach it? How familiar with its style and conventions did I need to be? I can’t answer those questions, so instead I’ll say what every teacher knows to be true: I wasn’t qualified to teach the material until I’d already taught..." />

			<p>I don’t want to steal <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/08/hugo-schwyzer-white-knight">anyone’s thunder</a> or appear to be piling on, but one aspect of Hugo Schyzer’s “<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/12/porn-professor-hugo-schwyzer-comes-clean-about-his-twitter-meltdown-and-life-as-a-fraud.html">confession</a>”
 strikes me as especially problematic, especially at a time in which the
 humanities are under assault from well-funded conservative forces: his 
claim of academic fraudulence. </p>
<p>He’s clearly not a fraud in the 
traditional sense, <em>i.e.</em> he didn’t falsify his credentials or 
publish papers on data he knew to be cooked. He claims that when he was 
in graduate school, “there was no such thing as porn studies,” so he 
lacked the credentials to teach it. Which, I suppose, is technically 
true. But he also claims to have “do[ne] the reading,” which in practice
 is all that’s required of scholars who work in a field that didn’t 
exist when they earned their doctorates. </p>
<p>The other “fraud” he believes he committed is that he spoke about 
feminism but “never published in any serious academic journal [because 
he] wanted to write for a popular audience.” Anyone familiar with the 
current state of academic journals knows about the incestuous nature of 
“blind” review: your name’s not on your submission, but if you’ve spoken
 at a conference or to another scholar in the field, you’re a known 
quantity. Your work whispers your name to the person who reviews it and 
that, as much as any independent factors, determines whether it’ll be 
published. (Why yes, I <em>am</em> that cynical.) But I haven’t come 
here to bury humanities journals—their “style” secures them a place in 
the deepest recesses of empty libraries—only to note that failure to 
publish in a discipline or subdiscipline doesn’t disqualify a person 
from teaching in it <em>if they’ve done the reading</em>. That’s all 
that’s required. If Schwyzer convinced his colleagues that he’d done the
 reading, he was qualified to teach a course in whatever it was he’d 
read.</p>
<p>Does this system require trust and lend itself to abuse? I suppose. 
But as someone who spent 13 years teaching at one of the best 
universities in the country, I can assure you that when you stand in front 
of a classroom of bright, motivated students <em>you always feel like a fraud</em>. You’ve never read enough, and you never will have. Your shelves will <em>always</em>
 be lined with books you should’ve already read. You feel like a fraud 
because you’ve only read thirty books on X, but your students consider 
you an authority for the very same reason. </p>
<p>Was I a hypocrite when I 
taught a literary journalism course after only having casually read Joan
 Didion, Hunter S. Thompson, Tom Wolfe, and John McPhee? What if I told 
you I’d also had a subscription to <em>The New Yorker</em> for a decade?
 How much literary journalism did I need to read to be able to teach it?
 How familiar with its style and conventions did I need to be? I can’t 
answer those questions, so instead I’ll say what every teacher knows to 
be true: I wasn’t qualified to teach the material until I’d already 
taught it a few times.</p>
<p>That doesn’t make me a fraud—it makes me a teacher.</p>
<p>Here’s a hypothetical: an academic writes a dissertation about, say, evolutionary theory in <em>fin de siècle</em>
 American popular culture, but later starts reading and writing about a 
subject in which he’d received absolutely no graduate level training. 
Like, I don’t know, film theory. He reads the seminal texts, then writes
 about it online, for a popular audience instead of an academic one, for
 the better part of six years. Would this academic be qualified to open 
an “Internet Film School” at the Onion A.V. Club? Would he be a fraud if
 he did?</p>

What kind of person would do such a thing? No, I’m not sure either. But I will say that, two days later, I'm even more fond of the title of my Holocaust piece than I was when I wrote it.</span></a></div>

THE ROAD: I AM FULL OF DEER! SEK: !?! THE ROAD: FULL OF DEER! SEK: !?! THE ROAD: DEER DEER DEER! SEK: SHIT SHIT SHIT! [slams on brakes] You could’ve said something. THE ROAD: !?! Having survived THE ROAD, SEK arrives in Baton Rouge. However, somewhere between California and Louisiana, the AWESOME HISPANIC MOVERS became GIANT ANGRY TATTOOED BELARUSIANS. SEK: You can just put all my worldly possessions in this perfectly normally storage unit on my friend’s property. GIANT ANGRY TATTOOED BELARUSIANS: We cannot do that. SEK: Why not? GIANT ANGRY TATTOOED BELARUSIANS: We do not do that. SEK: !?! GIANT ANGRY TATTOOED BELARUSIANS: Here is what you do, I tell you. You rent U-Haul, we meet in parking lot. You move your stuff to U-Haul, drive to home and costs you only one hundred. SEK: To rent a U-Haul for a day? GIANT ANGRY TATTOOED BELARUSIANS: For us to unload alone. Fifty if you help. SEK: Am I not already paying you a – GIANT ANGRY TATTOOED BELARUSIANS: You pay company, we are here. You want us unload, you pay us. SEK: Just so I have this right: I pay for a U-Haul, we meet in a parking lot, I hand you cash, and then I have to unload everything myself later? GIANT ANGRY TATTOOED BELARUSIANS: Fifty you help, hundred you don’t. SEK: I’ll help. GIANT ANGRY TATTOOED BELARUSIANS: Please to be sure. For two hundred we walk on grass even. SEK: I WILL HELP. SEK then is to be unloading a U-Haul by his lonesome, waiting for VERY STRONG GODCHILD and HIS VERY STRONG GODCHILD’S BROTHER to make finish with swim practice and become UNPAID CHILD LABORERS.</span></a></div>
