years to come, according to a statement by Dr. Charles Amos Dice,
professor of business organization at Ohio State University and author
of &quot;New Levels in the Stock Market,&quot; just issued by the McGraw-Hill

<p>Did I forgot to mention that this article is from 13 October 1929? 
Or that the aptly named Dr. Dice's book was published the week of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929">Black Thursday</a>?&nbsp; I considered a different approach—in which this post would've been a sequel to <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/08/14/some-times-i-feel-sorry-for-the-high-school-coach-who-cut-michael-jordan-from-the-jv-squad-because-quote-he-would-never-cut-it-on-varsity/" mce_href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/08/14/some-times-i-feel-sorry-for-the-high-school-coach-who-cut-michael-jordan-from-the-jv-squad-because-quote-he-would-never-cut-it-on-varsity/">this one</a>—but I didn't want to play this one for laughs.</p>
<p>Like <a href="http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=652" mce_href="http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=652">Timothy</a>, I'm not equipped to understand what exactly the market's up to.&nbsp; No matter how patiently <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/today-in-financ.html" mce_href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/today-in-financ.html">DeLong explains</a> the situation, I'll be lost by the second sentence.&nbsp; But I still feel <em>it</em>.</p>

				<p>It's on the porch.</p>
<p>It's through the window.</p>
<p>It's in the hall.</p>
<p>It's behind the door.</p>
<p>It's under the bed.</p>
<p>What do you do when the robber you fear morphs into a monster
beneath your bed?&nbsp; You can stop home invasions with moxie and a
baseball bat, but no amount of violence can cure a bed of monsters. 
Put differently: I have a <em>rational </em>fear of a McCain presidency, but I can alleviate it with a steady diet of polls and pundits; whereas I have an <em>irrational </em>fear of a catastrophic market collapse that can't be tamped by wit or wisdom.</p>
<p>Not that I don't try: I dutifully click on the links forwarded by
various trusted authorities and read their sources' take on the state
of the economy, but as we all well know, those takes differ.&nbsp; Economist
A declares W about X indicates a shaky 1,400.&nbsp; Economist B avails
himself of Y and Z to demonstrate the fundamental soundness of
1,400,000.&nbsp; But none of these authorities can answer my simple
question: Did we have our Black Tuesday already?&nbsp; Or was that our Black
Thursday, and we still have a Black Monday to look forward to before
the main event?</p>
<p>So I decided to see what was said in the weeks prior to the 29
October 1929, to see if there were some equivalent to the presentiments
of financial doom in residence beneath my bed.&nbsp; The results fail to
comfort.&nbsp; There are the odd personifications of the market's wares:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stocks of all sorts milled about in a curiously confused fashion yesterday.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are the half-finished attempts to impress:</p>
<blockquote><p>If all the margin calls sent out of Wall Street Saturday
morning were placed end to end, the line would stretch a great distance.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are the Palin-like reassurances whose confusions border on poetic:</p>
<blockquote><p>The stock market bobs up and down in a manner that must
be terrifying to the fledgling.&nbsp; Yet in the face of the ancient
contention that what goes up must come down, the bears are having a
hard time in getting a toe-nail's grip---even for a day.&nbsp; Up the pike
will come the bulls in a mad rush and teh crowd can hardly see the
score board for the dust.&nbsp; The shorts hardly stay in long enough to get
squeezed.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are the McCain-like declarations about the fundamentals of our economy:</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;There is no reason to feel unduly alarmed,&quot; one leading
banker declared.&nbsp; &quot;We have made careful inquiries and have failed to
discover that anyone has been seriously hurt.&nbsp; There is no danger of a
panic because the economic position of the country remains sound.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>There are many editors who share Colbert's fears:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/bears.jpg" mce_href="http://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/bears.jpg"><img height="91" width="320" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4336" title="bears" src="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/files/2008/09/bears.jpg" mce_src="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/files/2008/09/bears.jpg" /></a></p></blockquote>
<p>And there are many, many examples of hubris:</p>
<blockquote><p>We can only repeat that business is now too big and
diversified, and the country too rich, to be influenced by stock market
fluctuations.&nbsp; For the past six years the stock market has not been the
barometer of business it was when things were not so sound and
prosperous as they are now.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of which leads me to believe that at least we won't be sucker-punched by bears before the bulls maul us.</p>

The whole day looks fascinating, but this panel should be a thing of great and terrible profundity: (10:45) Blogging and the Academy Eszter Hargittai, Crooked Timber Tedra Osell, Bitch Ph.D. Scott Kaufman, Acephalous/The Valve Moderator: Catherine Lui, UC Irvine Before you ask: Tedra and I are indeed a package deal. (I considered getting the band back together and asking Bérubé and Holbo to join us, but Singapore's far away and Bérubé's not a blogger anymore.) My edgier side would've been listed, but Eric and Ari's didn't consider margins when they christened my other other other place. The other panels: (9:15) Public Spheres, Reason and Rationality in the 18th Century Sean Greenberg, UC Irvine John Smith, UC Irvine Moderator: Ann Van Sant, UC Irvine (2:00) The Transnational Public: China and Iran Kenneth Pomeranz, The China Beat Jeffrey Wasserstrom, The China Beat Elham Gheytanchi, Huffington Post Moderator: Alison Brysk, UC Irvine (3:45) Election 2008 Ezra Klein, The American Prospect Kevin Roderick, LA Observed John Wiener, UC Irvine Moderator: Amy Wilentz, Huffington Post (5:15) Wrap-up, Round Table, &amp; Reception</span></a></div>

(With luck it will be optioned.)</strong> Picture a boy playing with a toilet seat to no good end. His mother comes to rebuke him but his mother is not his mother! Remember Quantum Leap? This is exactly like that, except with a literary figure instead of Sam Beckett. (You know what I mean.) The literary figure inhabiting his mother's head? Edgar Allan Poe! Turns out that bloated fellow not wearing Poe's clothing wasn't Poe at all. Somehow or another, Poe had leapt forward in time into the boy's mother; and somehow or another, despite being all of two years old, he realizes this and screams, &quot;Mr. Poe! You are not my mother!&quot; Cut to the boy's 2nd grade play. His mother and father are in the crowd, and as he walks onstage dressed as Goofy, he spies his mother in the crowd only to find his mother is not his mother! She is Edgar Allan Poe! Again! The boy becomes flustered and nearly trips over his oversized shoes. His Poe-mother rushes the stage but the boy is already out the door and half-way down the hall. Years pass. His Poe-mother seems to have shook her Poe-self off. Until on the eve of his high school graduation, he looks across the kitchen table and realizes his mother is not his mother! She is Poe again! The boy darts from the table right into the sliding glass door. He regains consciousness sometime after midnight in the calm sterility of an American hospital. He finds this comforting until a figure emerges from a darkened corner. It's his Poe-mother! He tries to run but trips over the many wires glued and stuck into his parts. His Poe-mother approaches. He screams and— —and then I wake up. Why was Poe after me? Was he really after me? Or was it my mother he wanted all along? (Or a Freudian pun of such baleful provenance I deserve to be stabbed multiple times in painful places?)</span></a></div>
