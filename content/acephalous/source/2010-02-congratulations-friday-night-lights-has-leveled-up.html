		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01310f2d2958970c-content"><p>I haven&#39;t thought that, but I have thought that a FNL type setup would be perfect for a roleplaying game -- you have a natural party structure for the main characters, the high school setting gives you tons of relationships and drama to play with, and you can make the weekly games into an analogue for the interstitial combat that happens in most RPGs -- fairly rules-heavy set-pieces in which the players need to think tactically and work together -- but using the results to push ahead the drama in the other sections so it&#39;s all fairly unified and makes sense within the narrative.</p>

<p>I actually pitched my regular gaming group on this idea, but sadly only got limited interest, since mostly it&#39;s easier to stick with the usual fantasy/sci-fi/horror tripes.  Sigh.</p></span>

<p>You used something that refers to groups and things to refer to people!  You&#39;re the worst pedant ever!  (Sorry, I did mandatory office hours all day and feel the need to subject others to the shortcomings my interior monologues brought to my attention.)</p>

<p>That said, I see what you&#39;re saying, but what makes this show so odd is that you&#39;re never quite sure who&#39;s going to level up when, which means that at any moment some random fullback will X-treme! Chrysalis! and emerge moments later the second coming of Herschel Walker.  Which is fine and all, surprise-wise, but it doesn&#39;t make for the best narrative development.  (Although having watched a few more episodes, I think the writers migth could be aware of this and be playing with it ... which is why I shouldn&#39;t write about unfinished projects.)</p>

<p><em>I haven&#39;t thought that, but I have thought that a FNL type setup would be perfect for a roleplaying game -- you have a natural party structure for the main characters, the high school setting gives you tons of relationships and drama to play with, and you can make the weekly games into an analogue for the interstitial combat that happens in most RPGs -- fairly rules-heavy set-pieces in which the players need to think tactically and work together -- but using the results to push ahead the drama in the other sections so it&#39;s all fairly unified and makes sense within the narrative.</em></p>

<p>Russo, you&#39;re a geek after my own heart ... by which I mean, the fact that you used the word &quot;interstitial&quot; in a post about football and role playing games overbrims with awesome. </p>

<p><em></p>

<p>When Xander became soldier Xander I thought that was kind of super abrupt really.  But that&#39;s different.</em></p>

<p>Which, as you well know, exactly.  You may not remember, because I didn&#39;t write it up, but I taught that episode a few quarters back to no good end.  The students couldn&#39;t follow the scene changes, which saddened me because, you know, <em>Buffy</em>&#39;s wonderful, but not Joyce.*</p>

<p>*Sorry, I&#39;ve waited for years to employ that pun ... yet now that I have, I think it might not have been worth it.</p></span>

<p>Sort of, but in this case (and yes, I&#39;m thinking mostly of the vastly overrated Seven of Nine character) I think there was more confusion among the principle writers (and the series bible, which allowed them great lattitude) about the character, because the genius/idiot aspect was rarely central to the plot. </p>

<p><i>You used something that refers to groups and things to refer to people! You&#39;re the worst pedant ever! </i></p>

<p>Unless &quot;it&quot; refers to the quality (&quot;idiot or genius&quot;) rather than to the character (who, in some views, is an &quot;it&quot; not a &quot;sie,&quot; especially when the character is in some way fundamentally inhuman). Try and out-pedant me, will you?</p>

<p><i>(Sorry, I did mandatory office hours all day and feel the need to subject others to the shortcomings my interior monologues brought to my attention.)</i></p>

<p>So, you had a bad day; why should I suffer?</p></span>

I&#39;m specifically thinking of situations when the writers would decide hours after one of Jack&#39;s near fatal experiences that he suddenly had to deal with various physical/emotional repercussions.  These bursts of character &quot;development&quot; tended to be subtle compared to other abrupt changes, though, like bright and sunny conditions at 4:59:59 PM, followed by pitch blackness at 5:00:01.<br />
The writers could more easily get away with this sort of thing when the episodes aired weeks apart, but the DVDs made them glaringly obvious.  Then again, &quot;24&quot; is neither Joyce nor Buffy, so perhaps my expectations of verisimilitude are a tad high, and I need to try harder to suspend my disbelief (along with my moral reasoning) when I watch that show.</p></span>

At Racialicious, Thea Lim discusses Complex Magazine's list of The 50 Most Racist Movies You Didn't Know Were Racist, and while the majority of the list disappoints (on account of me already knowing the overtly racist films listed were racist), some of the entries simply baffle me. Foremost among them is Bulworth, Warren Beatty's film about the centrist penchant to use blacks as electoral pawns—Bulworth won't die in defense of his principles, but he will commit suicide for a lobbyist payday, at least until he realizes that black people are really people, at which point American political logic demands he be assassinated—but not far behind is Sopphia Coppola's Lost in Translation, which Lim glosses thus: [T]he whole point of the movie disgusts me. As in, the nauseatingly self-indulgent focus on the deep, brooding subjectivity of two Anglo-Americans, against a backdrop of depthless Japanese people who, with their hilariously absurd subcultures, bizarre language and affinity for bowing, are all exactly the same.Lim then quotes a section about self-involved white cluelessness from Restructure!: [W]hat disgusts me about Lost in Translation is that it centers on the lives of white people in a country where they are the minority, and it suggests that the social isolation that comes from being a minority is something that could only happen to white people.I'm not sure why either writer assumes that the experience Coppola describes in the film is something that can only happen to white people, because to me, the film seems to do the exact opposite: it demonstrates that white Americans are emotionally and intellectually unprepared to understand the non-majoritarian social experience. So maybe it does describe an experience that can only happen to white people—but only because white people are alone in being unable to recognize their privilege for what it is. Neither Bill Murray's &quot;Bob&quot; nor Scarlett Johansson's &quot;Charlotte&quot; have given a moment's thought to the plight of non-whites in American society, so the events of the film represent their first encounter with any form of double-consciousness—even one in which their whiteness still affords them privileged social stature. The film begins with caricature and absurdity because these characters are incapable of understanding Japanese society, or their roles as others in that society understand them to be; e.g. Bob is baffled by the arrival of an escort because he is unfamiliar with the sexism endemic in traditional Japanese business culture. Charlotte knows one of her roles—that of the tourist in exotic Japan—and indulges in some Orientalist fare, visiting a temple to watch some monks chant. Their relationship, such as it is, is only possible in an environment in which their previously stable and unquestioned identities have dissolved in the face of their own otherness. I took this to be a criticism of American insularity and arrogance, not an assertion of its eternal provenance. To an American audience, it may seem as if the...</span></a></div>
