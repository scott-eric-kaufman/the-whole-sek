				<p>My word processor has become a graveyard for needlessly informative or
woefully inadequate “statements of purpose”. Some contain my life story
in full, some limit themselves to my intellectual history, while others
are narrative attempts at explaining “how I got to where I am now,” but
their imposed narratives rendered all of them little more than wistful
fictions. So instead of making more stillborn contributions to “the
story of who I was and how that man became this one,” I will tell you
who I am and who I wish to become while attaining my doctorate. </p>

<p>“Who I
am” is a student interested in the more covertly political statements
made by literary works. For instance, I am currently writing an Honors
thesis on Thomas Pynchon’s criticism of colonialism and its concomitant
domination of language in his earlier novels, <em>V.</em> and <em>Gravity’s Rainbow</em>.
In writing this I have had my first experience of what graduate work
will be like, and to be truthful, I thoroughly enjoyed the nights I
spent in the library reading, among others, Frantz Fanon, Michel
Foucault, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. </p>

<p>Over the course of my graduate work
I intend to further<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=303,height=472,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/pu.jpg"><img width="100" height="155" border="0" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/pu.jpg" title="Pu" alt="Pu" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a> the study of literary and cultural theory I have
begun with this thesis (and in a modern criticism class I took this
semester). My theoretical interests are all over the map, ranging from
Jameson and the long Marxist tradition he represents to Lacan and the
better part of the Freudian canon, as well as where those traditions
collide, such as in the work of Althusser. To be honest though, right
now I am doing little more than dropping names. I read Jameson’s
<em>Political Unconscious</em> and am in the process of wrestling with Lacan’s
Ecrits, and my knowledge of Althusser is limited to what I gleaned from
William Dowling’s introduction to <em>The Political Unconscious</em>. In other
words, what I have read pales in comparison to what I will read, and I
am well aware that my knowledge base is in desperate need of expansion.
</p>

<p>This is not to say that I plan on reading theory to the exclusion of
other works, as I have a voracious appetite for fiction that theory
cannot begin to sate. As you could probably guess from the subject of
my Honors thesis, one of the people I am most interested in studying is
Thomas Pynchon, who also happens <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=399,height=579,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/d400xii72.gif"><img width="100" height="145" border="0" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/d400xii72.gif" title="D400xii72" alt="D400xii72" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>to be one of my favorite authors. I
also have a keen interest in James Joyce, stemming from a class I took
on <em>Ulysses </em>from Patrick McGee last spring. Sometime during my graduate
work I intend on studying in depth the one book of Joyce’s I have yet
to read, <em>Finnegans Wake</em>. But my interests are not limited to so-called
“modern” works of literature. For instance, I have already spent a
semester reading Dante’s <em>Commedia</em> and, with a little help from a friend
who has promised to teach me medieval Italian, I will someday soon read
it again in its native Italian. I also plan on studying more of what is
considered “canonical” literature, for if my forays into theory have
taught me anything, it is that there are strains of thought running
through even the most canonical works that demand they be re-read and
re-evaluated. To this end I have already re-read <em>Moby Dick</em> and have
started reading the complete works of George Eliot, a task I hope to
have accomplished in full by the time the Fall of 1999 rolls around. </p>

<p>My
interests are not even limited to what are considered “literary” works,
as a penchant for science fiction and other more “pulpy” strains of
literature has transformed itself into a desire to critically re-read
much of what I had previously read purely for entertainment. <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=1240,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/philip_k_dick_1962_the_man_in_the_high_c.jpg"><img width="100" height="155" border="0" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/philip_k_dick_1962_the_man_in_the_high_c.jpg" title="Philip_k_dick_1962_the_man_in_the_high_c" alt="Philip_k_dick_1962_the_man_in_the_high_c" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>For
instance, I have written papers on Philip K. Dick, Kim Stanley
Robinson, and Bruce Sterling, a group of authors I might not even have
acknowledged having read in a statement of purpose a couple of years
ago. What theory has enabled me to do is to see the value in what I
otherwise would have overlooked, such as science fiction, film, and pop
culture, and to examine these things with the same tenacity I once
reserved for “literature.” What that basically means, for me, is that
even if I find five rejection letters in the mail in five months time,
the course of my studies will not be altered. I fully intend on
continuing my studies for the rest of my life, in the directions that I
have indicated above, as those represent my current interests and
long-term goals. Those goals can and most certainly will evolve as I
learn more and discover new literatures and theories, which is what
excites me the most about continuing my education into and beyond the
graduate level.</p>

<p>Oh, and to read a UCI ABD&#39;s S.O.P on the very night I&#39;ve sat down to compose my own, and to find in your S.O.P. something radically dissimilar to my (possibly) misguided notion of what an S.O.P. should look, read, and smell like, I am now mired in a state of (probably unnecessary) confusion, apprehension, and grief over the proper form/tone my S.O.P should take.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/08/socialism_evolu.html"><span><strong>Socialism, Evolutionary Theory &amp; the Solipsism of the Dissertator</strong> Were Scott McLemee to cast his current project back a couple of decades, his usefulness to me would shoot up exponentially.[1] Sure, his bi-weekly Intellectual Affairs column somehow never disappoints the considerable expectations with which I anticipate it. Certainly, the standard he's set for blogging about academic matters is one all academic bloggers should aspire to meet. But answer me this: What has Scott McLemee done for me lately? Nothing. Except for the occasional edification. And clarification. And elucidation. Not to mention all the incidental detenebrations about alembicated over-subtilizations. (Rips sleeve off shirt. Tourniquet staunches learned but labored logorrhea. Spits. Appears overly pleased by own inscrutability. Arm of Angry God stretches from offstage left. Fingers roll into Infallible Fist. Angry God shakes Infallible Fist. Scott laughs heartedly, dies ironically.) My highly rational point is that the only value all people who are not Scott Eric Kaufman have for all people who are Scott Eric Kaufman resides in the catalytic potential of their thought and the possibility that it will assist all people who are Scott Eric Kaufman in finishing his damnably unfinishable dissertation. That said, were I not nearly blinded by myopic visions of completed chapters I would no doubt be incredibly interested in McLemee's current work. He's addressing many of the same issues I am only more directly, by which I mean &quot;not alembicated through refined literary filters like my work will day be.&quot; Of course, since popular and literary cultures are often indistinguishable in the period in which I work, my focus on the literature may allow me to address these issues with a confidence McLemee will never acquire, what with the rise of radio programs destined to fade unrecoverable into the ether. (If ever you wanted to excavate my insecurities, the previous sentence would be an excellent place to begin, e.g. &quot;What ate at Scott day-and-night for months-upon-months was the possibility that somewhere out there, in an &quot;archive&quot; consisting of the collapsed basement of a soon-to-be-demolished house, awaits an article providing incontrovertible evidence of Jack London's position on...&quot;) All of which is only to say that I believe I have to systematize my account of the relation of socialist thought to evolutionary theory. Right now it's currently more an account of what idiosyncratic socialist thinkers (like Jack London) considered a reasonable bridge between these two diverse bodies of thought. I have a hunch (based on three years of research) that the majority of thinkers wouldn't fit neatly into any recognized body of evolutionary or socialist thought, and that London's eclectisim is thus far more representative than one might think. Still, since socialist doctrine was far more routinized after the establishment of Communist Party liasons in the C.P.U.S.A. and evolutionary thought would be closer to the establishment of the Modern Synthesis, there's a good chance that both may've been far less adventurous than they had been at the turn-of-the-century. But I can't say that with any certainty. I had intended this discussion turn to the incompatibilities of &quot;social...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/08/some_signs_that.html"><span><strong>On the Indexical, Literally; or &quot;Running-amok, 368&quot;</strong> Some signs that your career in academia is well-chosen are easily recognized: loving sleep deprivation and its epiphanic stupor; wishing Figure X, Y or Z were more prominent so that others might admire the thoroughness with which you trounce him; considering afternoons spent unwriting pages of meticulously crafted prose &quot;productive&quot; and need I even continue? But one sign out-signifies all the rest. I speak, of course, of having a favorite index. You know you do. There's that one index out there that you read like a novel and cherish like a dead parent. Don't deny it. So today I step out onto this ledge of a limb and introduce you to my favorite index: The &quot;Index of Topics&quot; in Kenneth Burke's The Philosophy of Literary Form. If you want to know where Burke discusses &quot;Accepting (by one name), Rejecting (by another),&quot; all you need do is consult the index. If you were more interested in &quot;'Beauty,' via tonal disguise of the repellent,&quot; &quot;Catharsis by 'electoral obscenity,'&quot; or &quot;Destruction (of natural resources) poetically interpreted as 'advance,'&quot; consult the index. If you want to anticipate John Guillory's argument in Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Creation by a robust 57 years, consult the index then read about &quot;Education, as working capital of Intelligensia.&quot; The depressed can take comfort in his account of the &quot;Emptiness (of failure, of success),&quot; &quot;Expectancy, the 'arrows' of,&quot; &quot;'Medicine,' Hitler's&quot; or &quot;Humanitarianism, and Debunking.&quot; The aesthete can bask in the &quot;'Aesthetic Sense,' Special&quot; or ponder the conflict of &quot;Aesthetic, vs. Anesthetic.&quot; The blunt can read of &quot;Frankness, not 'distinterested curiosity'&quot; and complain of it with &quot;'Four-letter Words,' transformed.&quot; The socialist can learn where to find &quot;Laughter, 'Capitalist,'&quot; but lest he dive into his doldrums, he can also discover the &quot;Mythic Hero, recipe for&quot; and the &quot;Magic Formulae, 'outraged'&quot; required to cook Him or Her up. (Then he can discover arguments about &quot;'Prolitarian Literature as 'Pastoral'&quot; and put his outraged Magic Formulae to good use.) The overconfident can undermine their own arguments by reading &quot;Opponent, Unanswerable,&quot; &quot;Perspectives, Theory of (to transcend rival perspectives.&quot; The strict formalist can try (and fail) to verify his intuitions by turning to Burke's discussion of the &quot;Poem, not identical for writer and reader,&quot; but if his delusions get the best of him, he can &quot;succeed&quot; by &quot;Summarizing Term, as 'god-function.'&quot; Freudians can avoid the ubiquitous &quot;Unanswerable Opponent&quot; by asserting that the &quot;Universe, becomes 'guilt-laden'&quot; and denying that the &quot;Symbolic Act, in neurosis as distinct from art.&quot; (If that fails, they can commit &quot;Symbolic Suicide, as assertion.&quot;) [Note: The rest of the index is available below the fold.] Page 6: Page 7: Page 8:</span></a></div>
