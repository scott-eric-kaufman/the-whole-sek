In this case, the something in question was watching the wonderfully named Angel Pagan hit an inside-the-park home run and initiate a triple play in the same game.

I remember being six or seven years old and watching the Mets play the Cardinals in an afternoon game at Shea Stadium, and thanks to the miracle of the Internet, I can definitively say that at approximately 4:30 p.m. on 9 June 1985, I watched Terry Pendleton hit an inside-the-park grand slam off Joe Sambito in a game the Cardinals would go on to win handily. The fact that I can verify vague memories of events that occurred twenty-five years ago astounds me in a way I sometimes forget the Internet is capable of doing. This realization is obviously not of world-historical importance, merely a reminder that this thing whose existence we take for granted daily represents a fundamentally weird complement to human memory. The fact that at some point in the future I can know who I rode in an elevator with on 28 December 2005 is less weird because I chose to write about riding in an elevator with Grimace. That I can access detailed information about events I have no right remembering in detail is another matter entirely." />

Now that I remember him, which I didn&#39;t before, I remember him as being the pitcher who&#39;d pitched for 1) the team the Mets faced to get to the &#39;86 Series and 2) the one they faced in it.  I didn&#39;t remember that I remember that, but now that I do, I do.  Memory, as Gertrude Stein would say, is funny.</p></span>

Having given up on watching the actual sport, mention of baseball now only sparks memories of The Old Man and the Sea and the old time baseball writers.  It is true that at the end of time, the old time baseball writers will be hailed as the very best writers, as they had access to an event that was susceptible to beautiful writing, but horrendous to watch in person.  Plus, they smoked a prodigious quantity of cigarettes.    </p>

<p>nota bene:  An overdue library book is a crime against Humanities.  </p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/05/an-incidental-apocalypse.html"><span><strong>An incidental apocalypse?</strong> The typical apocalyptic narrative either focuses on the grand events that brought about the end of civilization—nuclear war, global pandemic, sentient machines—or describes life after the shock of those events. The number of narratives in which the global social body declines into the incorporeal slowly, almost without notice, are few and far between. Rarely do you encounter narratives in which, for example, a volcano on an isolated island erupts, deposits a thin layer of ash at 35,000 feet and reminds humanity that evolution didn't intend him to fly. Eyjafjallajökull killed no one—it merely disrupted air travel over a continent for a few weeks. As potentially apocalyptic events go, that barely even registers. But pair it with another narrative rarely encountered in apocalyptic literature, for example, a broken pipe, and it becomes possible—frighteningly possible—to imagine the ash in the air and the oil in the ocean collaborating to form an apocalyptic accumulation, if you will, with the power to unmake society in the same manner that Manuel DeLanda describes its invention in A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History. I only mention the notion that civilization will come undone by a series of non-apocalyptic incidents because: Some oil from the Gulf of Mexico spill is &quot;increasingly likely&quot; to be dragged into a strong current that hugs Florida's coasts, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) officials said today. But other experts say that the oil is already there—satellite images show oil caught up in one of the eddies, or powerful whorls, attached to the Loop Current, a high-speed stream that pulses north into the Gulf of Mexico and travels in a clockwise pattern toward Florida. Once in the Loop Current, oil can travel south and enter the Gulf Stream, a powerful ocean conveyor belt that carries warm water up the eastern seaboard. In which case, the oil that will be &quot;flowing robustly&quot; into the Gulf of Mexico for years will be carried approximately here: One need not share the dyspeptic cynicism of Eliot's hollow men to think that the world might, in truth, end not with a bang but a whimper.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/05/what-the-words-you-read-in-the-paper-really-mean.html"><span><strong>What the words you read in the paper really mean.</strong> When someone reports this: [O]fficials are warning residents nearby to be ready in case they were ordered to evacuate, the Riverside County Fire Department said. What they actually mean is that someone from your apartment complex knocks on your door and informs you that the fire department might have to evacuate you in less than five minutes, so anything you don't want burned alive (in the case of the cats) or to ashes (in the case of wedding photographs) should be right by the front door ready to run to the car. When someone reports this: &quot;The aircraft and the helicopters have been doing a pretty good job about keeping it from coming too close to these homes,&quot; said homeowner Warren Gillette. What they actually mean is that it'll sound like you're in the opening scene of a Vietnam film about to turn gruesome. I'm not sure what you think of when it sounds like air cav has arrived, but rest assured, the relentless buzzing of tankers and copters can unravel your core. I'd go to sleep, but I still need to figure out what my valuables are and find another cat carrier. I'm sure this will amount to nothing, but when it sounds like you're in a war zone, even things that amount to nothing rattle you insomniac.</span></a></div>
