I wrote: You would think someone at the WSJ would know that enough about literature to know that The Great Gatsby was published in 1925. If you grant the title its premises, the question should be “Did Someone Write a ‘Gatsby’ in 2004 and If So Who Was He or She and What Was the Title of It?” But that’s not quite right. The WSJ‘s infuriating decision to publish the titles of books in quotation marks means that we’re not even sure whether the current crisis will be producing a novel affectionately called Gatsby or a fictional Jew with class insecurities who meets an untimely end. Because we have umpteen examples of the latter—Curb Your Enthusiasm may even be a Gatsby-in-progress. Tune in next season to find out! But even that’s not quite right.

editorial entitled “Will This Crisis Produce a ‘Gatsby’?” I’ll link to

troublesome to warrant criticism.&#0160; I wrote:</p>

<p>Then I started reading the text itself.&#0160; The mention of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Adamic">Louis Adamic</a> seemed promising, and the rest of the article built what I took to be a fairly solid case until the last few paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote><p>John Steinbeck’s novel “The Grapes of Wrath” made the

<p>My response?</p>
<blockquote><p>If there’s one thing I learned writing my dissertation, it’s that you can’t throw words like “ideology” around like that—<em>especially</em> not when you’re claiming that a book published in 1939 laid the groundwork for the policies that were curtailed in 1939 by “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BtSU6ZaCbzMC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=%22dr.+new+deal%22&amp;ei=6MGxSaKPBYOQlQSFje1Q&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA126,M1">Dr. Win-the-War</a>.”
If I’d tried to end-around history like that I would’ve—I don’t know
what would’ve happened to me, actually, because I’d learned early in my
graduate career to avoid situations in which I could be browbeaten by “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=G9lbz7CzwzoC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22irrefragable+fact%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WCBVZuwGR7&amp;sig=TbZRkRcUGnS7yf1sbGQyUwaijqA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bcOxSaz-M4mGsQPm_YmKAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result">the fact, man, the irrefragable fact</a>!”</p></blockquote>
<p>I continued blustering on—scrolling back up the article, snipping
the bits that confirmed my claim of sloppy historicism and snarking
mightily upon them—until I returned to those final paragraphs and hit
the byline:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Sean McCann, a professor of English at Wesleyan University, is the author of “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691136955/diesekoschmar-20">A Pinnacle of Feeling: American Literature and Presidential Government</a>.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>At first I thought <a href="http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2009/03/05/human-remains/">I’d been pranked</a>.&#0160;
Then I realized I’d done it to myself: I’d read the article about as
uncharitably as it could be read.&#0160; I’d clipped the sections suggestive
of causality . . . and ignored all those that spoke directly to the
notion that the cultural output of the ‘30s <em>reflected</em> a growing disenchantment with the vision of social mobility that’d been aggressively asserted in the ‘20s.&#0160; See <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123517583815437521.html">Sean’s article</a> for all the details.</p>
<p>Me?&#0160; I’m off to go where they send half-cocked purveyors of online opinion when they misbehave: to <em>The Corner</em>.&#0160; (Dunce cap not optional.)</p>

I enjoyed the article when I read it and more after reding your post. I agree with your basic point that a generous reading teaches more and makes life a little easier to live, but critical thinking is the bedrock of that generosity. For example, there was no mention of all the Busby Berkley musicals or the Goldigger series in the movie references and there was an anachronistic feel to the piece in the sense that <i>Gatsby</i> was written on the way up and <i>Grapes of Wrath</i> on the way down. A little editing would have made the point McCann made a little clearer. But his use of words like myth, rhetoric and idea in reference to social mobility are pretty clear indicators of McCanns view of the reality of that mobility. Maybe he had to sneak it all past John Galt, social criticism editor at WSJ.</p></span>

I haven&#39;t read all of your post, so I may be missing something important you say later, but Gatsby is a Lutheran.</p>

<p>And while we&#39;re pretending fictional characters are real people, where does Tom&#39;s family&#39;s money come from?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef011168c9c767970c-content"><p>Seems to me there are a few different lessons one could take from this experiment/experience:<br />
1) Yes, the whole generous reading thing, blah, blah, blah, but more pragmatically:<br />
2) Ignore titles, or at least set them to one side, this one clearly having been chosen by an editor who simply picked the most recognizable literary name in the article and framed as a pointed presentatstic question (also comes with fetching file photo of Robert Redford).<br />
3) Read the article before you begin critiquing it.  As you say, if you hadn&#39;t been looking for examples, the structure of the actual article would have pointed you in a different direction. (Here I think I&#39;m think I&#39;m disagreeing with drip and agreeing with you the second that the point about <i>Gatsby</i> in the actual article was that it dealt with social and economic contraditions which would only be fully exposed later.)<br />
4)Read the byline first.  You know, just to make sure it&#39;s not someone you know.  About the only way this could have been better is if it had been wirtten by your actual advisor.<br />
It&#39;s good you share these cautionary tales with us.</p></span>

I think Scott&#39;s complaints are completely fair and very much appreciate the generosity shown here.  Yes, it&#39;s true that writers of op-eds don&#39;t get to choose their titles--and don&#39;t have full control over their content even--and, yes, it&#39;s very hard to get the WSJ to let you say anything very pointed or specific about, e.g., the myth of social mobility in the U.S.</p></span>

WITH DUMMIES LIKE YOU, WHO NEEDS THE MENTALLY DISABLED?&quot;</strong> (My actual review of the film can be found here. That post I'm holding off on is still M.I.A.) I’m holding off on that other Watchmen post because I think I might, um, be wrong about something fairly central to my argument. In the meantime, I have a declaration to make: I love Debbie Schlussel. Her review of Watchmen is simply to die for. To wit: If you take your kids to see “The Watchmen,” you’re a moron. If you see it yourself, you’re also probably a moron and a vapid, indecent human being. Set aside the fact that she punts the film’s title. Set aside the fact that she punts the film’s title even though the poster is included in the post. Concentrate instead on how she castigates hypothetical parents who would take their children to an R-rated film. Who is her audience? Who does she imagine it is? I know, it’s being heavily marketed as a superhero movie, with action figures for your kids. I see now—her audience consists of people who never click on links. Because if they did, they’d see Schlussel links to a limited run of 5,000 figures designed for I-buy-Power-Girl-statuettes crowd. But what about the hypothetical children? Who will care for the hypothetical children? But then, we see cops looking over their naked, bloodied, dead bodies on a bed, with the words “LESBIAN WHORES,” written in blood on the wall. Mommy, mommy, what’s a lesbian? What’s a whore? So our hypothetical terrible parent takes her hypothetical toddler to see an R-rated movie and—what’s an R-rated picture again? An R-rated motion picture may include adult themes, adult activity, hard language, intense or persistent violence, sexually-oriented nudity, drug abuse or other elements, so that parents are counseled to take this rating very seriously. Children under 17 are not allowed to attend R-rated motion pictures unaccompanied by a parent or adult guardian. Parents are strongly urged to find out more about R-rated motion pictures in determining their suitability for their children. Generally, it is not appropriate for parents to bring their young children with them to R-rated motion pictures. Thank you, official Motion Picture Association of America guidelines. Let’s compare rubric of the R-rating to Schlussel’s litany of offensive scenes in the film: Schlussel: Two superheroes have an explicit sex scene in a spaceship–she’s on top, then he’s on top, awesome–you can teach your young kids multiple sexual positions before they even reach puberty, by taking them to see this (there’s a less explicit sex scene between the slutty superheroine and another superhero not long before that). MPAA: . . . sexually-oriented nudity . . . Situation normal. Schlussel: Superhero “The Comedian” (a bad Robert Downey, Jr. look-alike) brutally beating and raping another superhero[.] MPAA: . . . adult themes . . . Situation normal.. Schlussel: [S]uperheroes hurling obscenities[.] MPAA: . . . hard language . . . Situation normal. Schlussel: A man’s hands and arms being sawed off with an electric saw–we’re shown the bloody stumps...</span></a></div>
