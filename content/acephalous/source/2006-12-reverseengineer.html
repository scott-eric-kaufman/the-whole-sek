<p>The following searches brought potential plagiarists to <a href="http://acephalous.typepd.com/">Acephalous</a> the last two weeks.&nbsp; What do you think the prompts prompting their searches looked like?&nbsp; Consider, for example:
</p>
<blockquote><p>“<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=is+tyler+durden+masculine+character&amp;btnG=Search">Is Tyler Durden a masculine character</a>?&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003W8NM/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Really?</em></a>&nbsp; Someone needed Google to answer <em>that?</em>&nbsp; I find it difficult to imagine the motivating prompt:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Is the central character in a novel epitomizing the
compensatory masculinity of “a generation of men raised by women”
really all that masculine?&nbsp; Your answer should take the form of a “Yes”
or a “No.” Students choosing the latter must also identify the occupant
of Grant’s Tomb.&nbsp; Failure to do so correctly will result in my friends
and I reconsidering our position on compulsory sterilization.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Some searches resist identification by virtue of their excessive generality, like the one demanding Google produce a “<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22ode+on+a+grecian+urn%22+good+reading+of">good reading [of] ode on a grecian urn</a>.”&nbsp; Do such searches betray the desperation of a beleaguered and waning faith in student intellection?&nbsp; 
</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the course of the semester, your profound ignorance
of history, literature, culture and the fundaments of English grammar
convinced me that anything resembling an argument written in anything
approximating standard English is almost too much to ask.&nbsp; I would no
more entrust you with a sentence than a baby with a machete, but as an
oral exam would remind me that you exist outside the nightmare my
therapist recommended I consider the fifty minutes I spend with you
demons three times a week, I have no choice but to suggest someone else
write your paper for you.&nbsp; Straight plagiarism is preferred, since your
transparent paraphrases will only force me to spend ten seconds
resenting everyone who decided the world would be a better place if no
one strangled you.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Then there are the students who leach the fun from this contest by including the prompt in their search, <em>e.g.</em>
</p>
<blockquote><p>“<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=what+are+the+elements+of+our+personality%3F+which+of+these+elements+are+the+result+your+heredity+and+which+are+the+results+of+your+environment%3F+was+nature+or+nurture+more+important+in+your+development%3F+how+did+you+become+the+person+you+are%3F+free+sample+essays&amp;btnG=Search">What

<p>
That search inspired me one of my own:
</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+social+darwinism%3F+did+it+really+exist%3F+or+did+people+believe+in+different+evolutionary+theories%2C+like+those+of+lamarck%3F+were+they+aware+that+they+did%2C+or+did+they+think+they+were+good+Darwinians+free+sample+essays">What

(No, context will not be forthcoming.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/12/the_repetitiona.html"><span><strong>The Repetitional Imperative</strong> The emails I've received this week about where I stand vis-à-vis my program and the job market forced me to acknowledge an uncomfortable truth about blogging under your own name: You're not nearly so important as you think you are. The assumption that everyone knows everything about you is pure hubris. Some people know some little something, but those people can be counted on one hand. Most people only know you as someone who writes what they read when stranded hikers and basketball brawls bore them to the bottom of the world. They know naught of your hopes, dreams, or life-and-death struggles with cancer. So it behooves you to repeat yourself every once in a while. Or write an &quot;About Me&quot; page which includes all this information. Thing is, preemptive pity parties strike most people as more than a little crass, so repetition it is: I won't hit the market this year. Before I started this blog, I lost a year I should've been working to feeling like shit. You see, I spent about seven months barely able to stop puking long enough to sleep. I slept-walked whilst dehydrated through a quarter and a half before I went to the doctor and discovered I had cancer. But as I'd been taught to keep my pain to myself and not make excuses, I kept it to myself, didn't make excuses and continued to teach. A sane person—by which I mean, a Jew without a Puritanical work ethic—would've taken a leave of absence. But I didn't. So in addition to the seven months I lost to feeling the effects of the tumor, I spent another six feeling the effects of its cure. I should've spent all of them working. (Not that I didn't work, mind you, I just didn't work well.) So after losing that year and some-odd months, I'd reestablished my writing routine and was looking forward to finishing my dissertation ... ... when I got hit by a car. The next seven months, I struggled to continue my researches. I would've done better were it not for that nagging feeling of impending vomit. And now it is today. So there you have it. I would be on the market this year were it not for a truly extraordinary string of bad luck. Now that I've fulfilled the repetitional imperative, I beg of you to come back. Repetition may be necessary, but it sure ain't pretty. If only there were some way I could guarantee you came back ...
