Cephalous</strong> Irrenowned linguist A. Cephalous loves his obsolete adjectives and anarthrous occupational nominal premodifiers. However, he loves thinking about the blazing speed with which humans produce intelligible language even more. So how pleased is he to learn that Dutch linguist Peter Hagoort won the 2005 Spinoza prize, a.k.a. the &quot;Dutch Nobels,&quot; for his work on neurobiological aspects of human linguistic competence? Very. Hagoort demonstrated that &quot;people know the grammatical data about a noun approximately 40 milliseconds earlier than they [utter] the first syllable of a word.&quot; (With 40 milliseconds being such a frickin' long time, it's no coincidence that Hagoort works at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.) According to Hagoort's 1998 article in Science, This knowledge includes information about the meaning of words, their syntactic properties (such as word class), and their phonological properties (such as their phonemes and syllable structure). All this information is stored in a component of long-term memory that is usually referred to as the mental lexicon. During speaking, the mental lexicon is accessed automatically at very high speed to select words that express the intended meaning, and to retrieve their syntactic and phonological properties....A central unresolved question concerns the orchestration in real time of the retrieval of the distinct types of linguistic knowledge required to produce fluent speech. The answer, as I've already mentioned, is about 40 milliseconds. And that's for speaking. How quickly is it for writing? The fellows at the A. Cephalous Center for the Unscientific Study of Scientific Science Stuff decided to find out. One of the fellows, Sneed, scientifically imbibed 3 gallons of water. Another, Tommy, scientifically steered Sneed's hand into a gallon of water warmed, scientifically, to room temperature. Lady lab assistant Marsha measured how long it took before Sneed's sallow face performed the familiar contortions of persons seconds away from mighty micturations. At this point the lab director, A. Cephalous himself, asked Sneed to remove his hand from the warm water and compelled him to confess to murdering by snickersnee the beloved office caricature, The Insolent Sailor, and informed him that he must also, scientifically, measure the speed with which he selected the appropriate words and retrieved their syntactic and phonological properties. The obliging Sneed--held captive by his busting bladder and the snickle A. Cephalous had slipped around his neck whilst removing his warm-watered hand--confessed to his morally dubious dastardly doings and begged to be unsnickled and unsnooled so that he might relieve the painful pressure of his bloated bladder. A. Cephalous declined Sneed's request. Snarling at his snickering former fellows, the snickled Sneed labored a lunge at his former fellows and much to mutual dismay nearly snapped his snickle. The snickle held but sad snarling Sneed's snooled neck did snap. His snobbish former fellows, saddened by the snapping of Sneed's snickled neck, quickly tired of disposing his detritus and decided to dedicate the day's remaining light to snuggling and snogging. Those few fellows without women with whom snuggling and snogging would be constant and consensual were to retire...</span></a></div>

Cephalous Will Never Have Children</strong> From William Gass' &quot;The Soul Inside the Sentence&quot;: Forbidden to refuse food, the child may throw up (and what can you do about that, mommy, but buy a new bucket and mop?); punished, its nose bleeds (so there daddy-o, you brute!); it develops allergies (especially to milk), becomes asthmatic, pees in drawers filled with silks, on platters, in planters like a cat, poops in its pants or on the vinyl, has earaches, dawdles, talks too much or absolutely not, stutters to remind you how you've terrified it, or mumbles to make you ask, what? destroys its toys or picks its nose or fights, or rubs its crotch or whines and wheedles, or cries at the sight of strangers, dogs, or beetles, makes lewd suggestions as if in all innocence, at bedtime needs lights and unsettles your sleep with its dreamings, throws up in cars or at birthday parties, becomes overexcited, plays with matches, develops a cry like a shaken saw, swears precociously, spits, has a permanently runny nose, scabs on knees and elbows, dirt like a clown's comical cosmetic around its mouth, holds tantrums in shops the way some hold public meetings, darts into the street and pushes over bicycles, filches pennies, is a victim of inexplicable frights, fads, and manias, is peevish, pouts, enjoys meaningless disobedience or extended sulks, or pesters the grownups like bees at a picnic, but disappears when called and hides when sought, can be sugary and solicitous, docile and loving, yet when no one is watching scratches, pinchis, hits, kicks, and bites.
