Although the violence which with his case concluded is anomalous, this transcript succinctly captures not only the cultural milieu of Summer 2003, but also its continued (and possibly salutary) resonance. The first voice you hear belongs to the late Shelby Darling; the second, Patient #3987. Breathe deeply. Slowly. Focus on the experience of breathing, the feel of cool air over your lips, into your lungs, then out again. Now listen to the smooth, soothing sound of my words as they wash over your worries and fears. You are in a safe space, now. Nothing from the grind can disturb the peace you now inhabit now. You lose yourself in the warm embrace, of my calming words, and you breathe deeply, and you breathe slowly, and you feel the cool air cross your lips . . . . . . and you look around you, at your surroundings. You are in a familiar place, but you experience it from an angle that makes it seem unfamiliar now. Tell me, [#3987], what do you see? I hear Kenny Mayne shouting. He sounds scared. Someone else is shouting too. &quot;The devils!&quot; they scream, and together they scream, &quot;The devils!&quot;1 Where am I? You're in a safe place, remember. Now take a deep breath and gently walk away from the voices. Now, continue to retreat, calmly, orderly, to your safe space. Ignore Kenny Mayne. Kenny Mayne can't harm you here. You're in a safe space. Now take a deep breathe . . . I can't go back there. The devils, he said, the devils. I can't. DIDN'T YOU HEAR WHAT KENNY MAYNE SAID ABOUT THE DEVILS? It's alright, [#3987], everything's going to be alright. You're under my protection. Neither Kenny Mayne nor his devils can hurt you so long as I'm here. Now, I want you to return to that familiar place, and inhale. Now, look around again, and exhale. Ignore Kenny Mayne for the moment and tell me what you see. I see a poster on the wall and, and I see a man in a bathrobe, but not in a bathroom.2 He's near the television, but there's no picture, no sound anymore. Tell me more about this man. He seems adrift, lost in a culture not his own. He looks bedeviled, yes, bedeviled by feelings of inadequacy. This all means more, I think, more than this . . . Tell me one thing . . . . . . there is nothing, that's what he's thinking. That there's nothing more than this.3 I can hear Kenny Mayne again. He's yelling again: &quot;The devils have one! The devils have one!&quot; What do they have? I don't know. Then the devils have nothing.4 They're weak. Mental representations of fears you can't face alone. But I'm here, I'm here with you now.

this point the tape abruptly ends.&nbsp; The first salient fact about this
transcipt are the frequent, indirect references to the year 2003.&nbsp; In
what follows, I will reconstruct Patient #3987's experiences that year
and describe how the unconscious trauma sustained 1) explains the
violence with which his and Dr. Darling's lives ended and 2) presages
the prosecution of its symbolic equivalent by a similarly traumatized
American public.&nbsp; This symbolic equivalent, as I will argue at length
later, could contain the seeds required to create a space for a
radical, progressive intervention in mainstream US politics.&nbsp; To that
end, I begin by describing how America's desire was militated, then
repressed by the events of 2003, starting with the sudden (but
significant) popularity of the Lyte Funky Ones. </p>

<p><strong>II.</strong></p>

<p>Citizens like Patient #3987 reacted to the unfettered voice of the
globo-capitalist, American unconscious speaking through the Lyte Funky
Ones.&nbsp; As the President prepared and launched a preemptive strike
against Iraq, the Lyte Funky Ones launched their own preemptive strike
against the intelligence of the Patient #3987 and American people.&nbsp; The
lyrics to their hit &quot;Summer Girl&quot; paved the way for the invasion of
Iraq by flooding the airwaves with material of the American
unconscious.&nbsp; Take, for example, the opening verse:</p><blockquote><blockquote><center>New Kids On The Block, had a bunch of hits.<br /> Chinese food makes me sick.</center></blockquote></blockquote><p>
The American psyche—long accustomed to the simple, heroic narratives
alluded to in the song itself (see below)—could not handle such random
articulations of fact and taste.&nbsp; The song leaps from a popular mall
clothier to a condemnation of Chinese cuisine—almost as if the
unconscious were speaking <em>in song </em>much
as it does in dreams.&nbsp; America, &quot;asleep,&quot; could be manipulated.&nbsp; The
Administration knew that a &quot;slumbering&quot; population would be unable to
understand and unlikely to care about rational arguments or important
issues.&nbsp; So it acted.&nbsp; But what did it act upon?&nbsp; And how?</p>

<p>I will address the second question first, since it addresses the
dual role and syngeristic effect the Lyte Funky Ones had in the events
of that summer.&nbsp; The power of &quot;Summer Girls&quot; is the product of the fact
that it speaks <em>to the objects of desire in the language of the desire</em>.&nbsp; It catalogues desire while stimulating it.&nbsp; The cumulative effect is one of emasculating nostalgia.&nbsp; First the lyrics:<br /> </p><blockquote><center><strong>
Hip Hop, marmalade, Spic &amp; Span,
</strong><br />Met you one summer and it all began
<br />You're the best girl that I ever did see,
<br /><strong>The great Larry Bird, jersey 33.

</strong><br /><br />When you take a sip, you buzz like a hornet,
<br /><strong>Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets.
</strong><br />Call me Willy Whistle, cause I can't speak baby.
<br />Something in your eyes went and drove me crazy.

<br /><span style="color: #ffffff;">h</span><br />Now I can't forget you and it makes me mad,
<br />Left one day and never came back.
<br />Stayed all summer, then went back home,
<br /><strong>Macauly Culkin wasn't Home Alone.

</strong><br /><br />Fell deep in love, but now we ain't speakin',
<br /><strong>Michael J. Fox was Alex P. Keaton</strong>.
<br />When I met you, I said my name was Rich:
<br />You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch.<br /><br />You come from Georgia where the peaches grow,<br /> They drink lemonade and speak real slow.
<br />You love hip hop and rock n roll.<br />Your dad took off when you were 4 years old.<br /><br /><strong>There was a good man named Paul Revere.
</strong><br />I feel much better baby when you're near.<br />You love fun dip and Cherry Coke.<br />I like the way you laugh when I tell a joke.<br /><br />When I met you I said my name was Rich.
<br />You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch</center></blockquote><p>[<em>end of excerpt</em>]</p>

I've finished the first twelve issues of Warren Ellis's Planetary, and if you can stomach one egregiously lame &quot;revelation,&quot; I'm sure you'll agree it's the one of the best damned thing you've read in some time. You'll have to think to the left, the right, before and behind &quot;the box&quot; to do so, but I guarantee the effort'll be worth the reward. So if you're an honorable person who fancies novel stimuli, send me an email (at any of the addresses I haunt) and I'll send you a substantial something or other. IRONIC CODA: If you've sent me an email in the past three weeks and I have yet to respond, I apologize. Earlier this evening, I discovered approximately seventy emails in Gmail's spam folder which don't belong there. I'm in the process of responding, but have serious doubts about my stamina, so if you don't hear from me tonight, please don't add it to your tally of my inequities. I'm hard at type rehabilitating my good name, and the wonky vibes you'd be broadcasting could bring this whole show crashing down.</span></a></div>
