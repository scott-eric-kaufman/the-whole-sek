        <meta name="description" content="Alyssa Rosenberg's response to my earlier post reminded me that I never got around to finishing the discussion of Blowup I started in this one, but before doing so I want to note something that my students teased from the film yesterday. Antonioni structures the film around a series of moments in which the sound and actors and actions are at odds with the world. The first involves the mimes at the beginning of the film: Why is that mime's mouth open? Because she is yelling. The second scene occurs slightly after this shot: The blonde on the left is willing to have sex with Thomas in exchange for photographs, but the brunette in the center is not. So what happens? The blonde helps Thomas strip her friend and he proceeds to rape her. How does she react? She laughs while resisting. The third scene occurs at the Yardbirds' concert: As Keith Relf sings about &quot;strolling on&quot; and Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck dual it out on guitars, the crowd remains eerily immobile. The fourth (and most famous) instance finishes up the film: Having retrieved and returned the imaginary ball for the (now silent) tennis-playing mimes, Thomas stares at them and begins to hear an actual tennis match. Why Antonioni created this disconnect between the sound and the onscreen actions in a film that obsesses on the visual is not a question I can answer at the moment. But it is significant that the screaming mimes, giggling victims, unmoved attendees and impossible tennis all contribute to the overweening sense of wrongness that permeates the film. What do I mean by that? In addition to the above, there is the opening sequence in which Antonioni violates the 180° rule by having the van full of mimes exit to and emerge from the right: Followed by an eyeline match between people in different areas of the city: To a bizarre series of cuts in which the camera seems to flip along the vertical axis as Thomas faces the camera: Then turns his back to it: Only to be facing it again immediately thereafter: It feels as if he walks into the camera, which then somersaults to catch his back before darting in front of him to catch his face again, almost as if Antonioni is doing to Thomas, his subject, what Thomas will shortly to do his: It makes a certain amount of narrative sense for the camera to dance in this fashion, if only because it places the audience in the role of the model being surveilled, but the result of this odd sequence of shots is a profound and deliberate disorientation. The audience is unclear where it stands with relation to the diegetic world depicted onscreen—which it now occurs to me may be the point. Just as Thomas relates, through his camera, to a world that has ceased making sense—as evidenced by his non-evidence of a crime he can't prove was committed—so too does the viewer relate to Thomas' world...." />

<p>Or something along those lines.&#0160; Next time I promise to stop trying to solve the film and discuss how it establishes an operative definition of &quot;slowness&quot; for my course.</p>

His movies are full of interest but shouldn&#39;t be presumed to be coherent. (<i>L&#39;Avventura</i>, I&#39;ll admit, is engaging from start to finish, while also full of good stuff.) So when we ask, &quot;why is the movie weird in this way?&quot;, the answer we get isn&#39;t guaranteed to be satisfying.</p></span>

Despite all the condemnation of everyone else's &quot;violent rhetoric,&quot; I've yet to see one post in which the term itself is defined. It seems to mean, in the current political vernacular, anything said by someone else that involves anything even remotely violent. Katrina Trinko's attempt to tu quoque Keith Olbermann is particularly enlightening, as it describes a number of angry statements by Olbermann that are neither violent nor rhetorical, e.g. In 2007, Olbermann called rival network Fox News “worse than al-Qaeda ... for our society” and said the channel was “as dangerous as the Ku Klux Klan ever was.” Neither of those statements are rhetorical because neither of them attempts to call its audience to action. For them to be rhetorical, as per Aristotle in On Rhetoric, they would need to be intended to persuade. Moreover, they would need to be intended to persuade a particular audience to undertake a particular action. This is the rhetorical triangle: Note the interconnectedness of the speaker and audience. The general problem with discussing rhetoric in the current media environment is that the particularity of the audience is absent. Anyone can read or watch or listen to anything without regard for their relation to the intended audience and without reference to the action whose commission the rhetor intends. In such a situation, it is not surprising when the mode of persuasion favored by speakers is the one that is most effectively general. To quote Aristotle again: The first [mode of persuasion] depends on the personal character of the speaker [ethos]; the second on putting the audience into a certain frame of mind [pathos]; the third on the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself [logos]. Though pathos is typically translated as an &quot;appeal to emotion,&quot; it is better understood as an &quot;appeal to imagination.&quot; Anything that stokes the imagination, be it an image or a narrative, fits the bill. It goes without saying that the majority of political rhetoric in America is, in this technical sense, pathetic. This is simply because most politicians have questionable ethos and very few have speechwriters sufficiently talented to produce persuasive logos. But it is also because most Americans are too suspicious of political motives to allow politicians to establish an ethos and too untrained in the literary arts to understand an appeal to logos. Typically, then, we are left in a situation in which politicians, as rhetors, design speeches whose pathos is general enough to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. It stands to reason that if we want to understand what &quot;violent rhetoric&quot; entails, we must focus on whose images and stories are stoking whose imaginations and to what effect. Pointing out that Keith Olbermann associated Fox News with terrorist organizations foreign and domestic does nothing of the sort because the audience and...</span></a></div>

The reason why we need a special phrase like “blood libel” to denote lies told about what Jews do with the blood of baby Christians is the sheer number of libels which Jews have had to contend over the years. He gets to the &quot;ass libel&quot; and the &quot;leper libel&quot; soon enough. (No, neither of us is kidding.)</span></a></div>
