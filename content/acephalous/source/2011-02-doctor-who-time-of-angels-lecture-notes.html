Let me say it again: they are a malevolent race of statues. How do they demonstrate their malevolence? When you're not looking. There's a purity to the concept of creating a monster whose movements perfectly (and can only, because they must) match the cinematographic vocabulary of horror. Every time the camera is on them, they must be statues, meaning the audience must actively infer their off-screen movement. The audience must be attentive because they won't be able to sit back and observe the proceedings (and because if they do there won't be any proceedings to sit back and observe). The challenge for Moffat and director Adam Smith is to take this ingenious metaphor for horror films and turn it into something genuinely horrifying. What follows is how they do it in the beginning of the episode. First, they place the Doctor's companion, Amy Pond, in an enclosed space: This is a fairly long shot, the purpose of which is to provide the audience with a sense of both a character and that character's status relative to his or her environment. It also uses deep focus ironically, keeping everything in focus so that the audience can see just how much of it there isn't. Additionally, the tight framing of the shot is similar to this scene from Mad Men, except here those lines are both imagined and actual because she's in a metal tube. The result is a claustrophic atmosphere, but a bit menacing, too, because the audience knows the cheat cut is effected from the position on the wall occupied by the recorded image of an Angel: Note that Smith eschews a point-of-view shot and instead places the camera equidistant between the recording and Pond.

<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c86e02d0970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Doctor who time of angels00002" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c86e02d0970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c86e02d0970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Doctor who time of angels00002" /></a> <br />He is a funny old man with a magic blue box <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS" target="_self">whose Wikipedia entry</a> is longer than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire" target="_self">New Hampshire&#39;s</a>, so I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be able to briefly sum up who and what he is.&#0160; Suffice it to say he&#39;s the English equivalent of Superman, only intellectualized instead of strong.&#0160; You don&#39;t really need to understand the Doctor to understand this episode or my post, though; more important for the present are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_of_Angels" target="_self">the Weeping Angels</a>, a malevolent race of statues created by the current show-runner, Steven Moffatt.&#0160; Let me say it again: they are a malevolent race <em>of statues</em>.&#0160; How do they demonstrate their malevolence?&#0160; <em>When you&#39;re not looking</em>.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a purity to the concept of creating a monster whose movements perfectly (and can only, because they must) match the cinematographic vocabulary of horror.&#0160; Every time the camera is on them, they must be statues, meaning the audience must actively infer their off-screen movement.&#0160; The audience must be attentive because they won&#39;t be able to sit back and observe the proceedings (and because if they do there won&#39;t be any proceedings to sit back and observe).&#0160; The challenge for Moffat and director Adam Smith is to take this ingenious metaphor for horror films and turn it into something genuinely horrifying.&#0160; What follows is how they do it in the beginning of the episode.&#0160;</p>
<p>First, they place the Doctor&#39;s companion, Amy Pond, in an enclosed space:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c86e3221970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Doctor who time of angels00048" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c86e3221970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c86e3221970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Doctor who time of angels00048" /></a></p>
<p>This is a fairly <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48039" target="_self">long shot</a>, the purpose of which is to provide the audience with a sense of both a character and that character&#39;s status relative to his or her environment.&#0160; It also uses <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#38561" target="_self">deep focus</a> ironically, keeping everything in focus so that the audience can see just how much of it there isn&#39;t.&#0160; Additionally, the tight framing of the shot is similar to <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/09/mad-men-in-the-suitcase.html" target="_self">this scene from <em>Mad Men</em></a>, except here those lines are both imagined <em>and </em>actual because she&#39;s in a metal tube.&#0160; The result is a claustrophic atmosphere, but a bit menacing, too, because the audience knows the <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#51524" target="_self">cheat cut</a> is effected from the position on the wall occupied by the recorded image of an Angel:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c86e44de970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Doctor who time of angels00049" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c86e44de970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c86e44de970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Doctor who time of angels00049" /></a> <br />Note that Smith eschews a <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48019" target="_self">point-of-view shot</a> and instead places the camera equidistant between the recording and Pond.&#0160; The previous shot established that these are extremely tight quarters, and zooming in to this <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#98485" target="_self">eyeline match</a> makes them feel even tighter.&#0160; This is espeically true because the series often consists of the camera following the Doctor as he whirls about in his magic blue box, which is itself whirling about through space and time.&#0160; The entire series is predicated on an escapist conceit, which is why &quot;it&#39;s bigger on the inside&quot; is so critical to the show&#39;s appeal—not to mention why a box that isn&#39;t bigger on the inside is such a terrifying concept to this audience.&#0160; To return to my point: this is a bad box.&#0160; A confining box.&#0160; Only bad things can happen in a confining box, and Smith is framing these shots in order to heighten the impression of confinement.&#0160; Both shots above are impressively framed themselves, but more significantly, the shots and <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#51531" target="_self">reverse shots</a> within the bunker use the same <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48004" target="_self">angle of framing</a>.&#0160; The <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48009" target="_self">level of framing</a> shifts as Pond approaches the image, but not the angle, which results in the scene feeling very constricted: can&#39;t look up, can&#39;t look down, only straight ahead:</p>

<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e265724d970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Doctor who time of angels00059" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e265724d970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e265724d970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Doctor who time of angels00059" /></a> <br />Because it suggests that the image is staring back, and <em>images shouldn&#39;t be capable of staring back</em>.&#0160; Moreover, the zooming in suggests that the image is paying an increasing amount of attention to her, and <em>images ought not be able to express increasing interest</em>.&#0160; It&#39;s almost as if the audience becoming uncomfortable because the episode is telling them, in filmic terms, something they know can&#39;t be true.&#0160; Pond then leaves for a moment to ask the Doctor a question, and when she returns so too does the camera, first to its original position:</p>

<p>(There&#39;s much more to say about this scene and episode, but I still have another class to prepare for.&#0160; More then, possibly, later.)</p>

Too much blogging and writing a pedagogy book instead of revising the dissertation must do that, I suppose, because this doesn't even sound like me: Linking Sim to Pound by reference to their similarly developing relationship to form and to Joyce by their analogous material circumstances may seem like an attempt to shoehorn Sim into a canon in which he does not properly belong. However, Sim's inclusion and ventriloquism of another notable Irish modernist, Oscar Wilde, in Jaka's Story requires at the very least that the book be considered an homage to, or possibly a parody of, Wilde's high modern aesthetic. Whether the book partakes of that high modern aesthetic depends upon an estimation of the success of the ventriloquism, but even if it is unsuccessful, the inclusion alone is enough to warrant numbering Sim among academic modernists like Pound and Joyce. Because there exist as many definitions of “modernism” as scholars of it, for the purposes of the current argument—not to mention general relevance—these competing modernisms will be defined specifically by the attitude they strike to history. In this respect, the high modernism of Wilde can be characterized by its rejection of mimesis and the attendant distancing from history that that rejection entails, whereas the academic modernism of Joyce and Pound seeks to, as the latter urged, “make it new,” with the “it” in question being the nightmare of history from which the former struggled to awake. That Sim lifts Wilde from history and employs him as a narrator in Jaka's Story is not merely an irony seemingly designed to irritate the author of The Decay of Lying, but in “making Wilde new,” Sim demonstrates a formal and aesthetic solidarity with the academic modernists. The highest irony of Wilde operating as a narrator is that he is not narrating Sim's book, Jaka's Story, but one that exists within Sim's titled Daughter of Palnu—meaning, in short, that not only does Sim's imitation of Wilde violate the principles of high modernism, but he employs the imitation to write a book which itself violates the principles of high modernism by relating the actual story of an exiled princess named Jaka. The word “actual” is not meant to imply that Daughter of Palnu is factually accurate, merely that because her story is related to Oscar by her husband, Rick, no matter how fantastically Oscar embellished the novel would still be one in which, to paraphrase Wilde in The Decay of Lying, art would be imitating life. I feel like, I maybe need, a few more, commas. Also, this is, or may be, my most boring, post ever.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/02/a-better-purer-science.html"><span><strong>A Better, Purer Science</strong> As someone who wrote a dissertation entitled “Maximal Diversity: Non-Darwinian Evolutionary Theory in American Fiction, 1895-1910,” I can’t help but lend my full support to this bill: Oklahoma state Rep. Sally Kern wants to make it clear that her new legislation protecting the rights of science teachers to “teach all science instead of just the Darwin model” is in no way an attempt to introduce creationism or Intelligent Design into the classroom. It is, in fact, just an attempt to let teachers teach “pure science” about “all of evolution” No student in Oklahoma can possibly understand the modern world without a firm grasp of heterogenesis, Lamarkian inheritance, kinetogenesis, orthogenesis, metakinesis, geographic isolation, biologic isolation, the Baldwin effect, organic selection, and orthoplasty, to name but a few. To stick to those strains of evolutionary theory that Morse Peckham called “Darwinisticistic” is a travesty against science and democracy that can only be rectified by the State of Oklahoma commissioning to write a textbook for many moneys.</span></a></div>
