        <meta name="description" content="At 8 a.m. on the morning of 16 June 1904, two men woke up. One shaved for class and breakfasted with his usurper and an anti-Semite. The other, a Jew, purchased a pork kidney, ate it, then stared at his wife in the same bed in which she cuckolded him. He left to pick up a letter from his secret sweetheart and chatted with the people he met on his way to the baths. Once clean, he attended a funeral and saw a mysterious man. After the funeral, he tried to place an advertisement in a local newspaper but decided more research was required, so he scooted off to the library where, unbeknown to him, the first of our two men was disquisiting on Shakespeare. Many people walked around, including our Jew, who decided to follow his morning kidney with an afternoon liver. He ogled the barmaids and thought about his wife who, if his suspicions were correct, would soon be cuckholding him again. So he exited the bar with the pretty reminders of his pain and entered another full of anti-Semites. Fists and cans were thrown. Troubled by thoughts of wife and ancient grievances, he wandered seaside way and publicly co-masturbated with a cripple. He later attended the birth of a child and the English language before following our first man into the red-light district. He caught up with him, himself, himself-in-drag, his dead grandfather, Nobodaddy, a giant green crab, a talking hat-stand and ducked out when the police arrived. Chastened, the two men entered a dive and met a drunken sailor. They absconded to the home of the Jew and bonded while urinating under the stars. As 16 June 1904 came to a close, the Jew returned to his troubled marital bed and asked his wife to serve him breakfast in it tomorrow. She considered his request but never decided one way or the other.

A second-long Easter egg that no one notices until the producers point it out in the DVD commentary doesn't really qualify as a pointed rhetorical statement. Not that it won't be spun into one as soon as someone emails that link to Jonah Goldberg or Jeff Goldstein—both of whom will point out that it'd be considered both violent and racist if it were Obama's head—but it's still an Easter egg, which by definition limits its appeal to the Bush-hating, Martin-loving, DVD-commentary-watching crowd, which likely numbers in the tens. That said, I don't buy the producers' claim that it wasn't &quot;a choice [or] a political statement. We just had to use whatever head we had around.&quot; The scenes in King's Landing were filmed in Malta, so I find it difficult to believe they happened to have a plastic replica of W.'s head just lying around. Unless there's a booming Maltese trade in eerily life-like effigies of which I'm unaware, that Easter egg was planted there purposely. Rhetoric aside, there's all sorts of fun to be had with this, including (but not limited to) questions such as &quot;What's the sigil of House Bush?&quot; I contend it'd be this: A root-rotten shrub surrounded by all the weapons of mass destruction W. found in Iraq. Feel free to offer your own suggestions in the comments.</span></a></div>

As I'm not wont to abandon perfectly decent material to the unknown algorithms lording over the most skidded of Google's rows, I think it's about time for me—by which I mean you—to figure out the best material I produced between 2009 and 2011. I've even made alluring icons to represent whatever you believe to be my best. For 2009, which begins here and tracks the year after I earned my dissertation, I'm going with this: [UPDATE: You can see a list of the &quot;winners&quot; by clicking on the image above or, if you're very lazy, this link.] For 2010, which begins here and tracks my first year working full time while trying to hit the job market, I've come up with this: My chances are so good! It's springtime! Just look at that tree! So for 2011, which begins here and must have gone better from a professional standpoint, I concocted this: Or, like most candidates, I died a little inside. But pity me not! Just vote! Vote! Vote! Vote! (Otherwise I'll have to re-read everything I've written over the past three years and will, inevitably, annoy myself by revising and tweaking ever single post. Save me the trouble, my friend, and enjoy your journey through my archives.)</span></a></div>
