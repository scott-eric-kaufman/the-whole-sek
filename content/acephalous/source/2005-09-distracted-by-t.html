        <meta name="description" content="For awhile now I've subscribed to the Jack London Listserv. The discussions range from typical fanboy esoterica (&quot;What ever happened to the Snark?&quot;) to scholarly inquiries into London's sexual orientation (&quot;Was Jack a pitcher or a catcher?&quot;). I had never looked at the listserv's official homepage before, but needless to say I was shocked by this guide to student submissions to it: Students doing papers on London are welcome to send questions, however they should be aksed after the research is underway. Do not ask questions like, &quot;How did Jack London's writings express social Darwinism?&quot; or &quot;Where can I find criticisms of The Call of the Wild?&quot; Instead, be precise, such as &quot;I'm including the following stories for a paper on London and Social Darwinism ... Have I left any out?&quot; Or, &quot;X says the following about The Call of the Wild ... Here is my idea. What do others think?&quot; In other words, do your own footwork first. Now those of you familiar with my dissertation know why this amuses me: I'm currently writing a chapter on London in a dissertation devoted to proving illegitimate questions like &quot;How did Jack London's writings express social Darwinism?&quot; One critical component of my argument is that literary scholars, academic historians and the general public have an unshakeable belief that some thing called &quot;social Darwinism&quot; exists and that popular writers (especially naturalists like Jack London) glean their unflappable faith in some form of pernicious environmental determinism from it. Only it doesn't and they don't. I would love to include that excerpt from the listserv's home page in the list of general misconceptions that necessitate a project like mine. Somehow I don't think it meets the evidentiary standard for academic papers. Then it hits me: I would have (and in fact have not had) any problem including similar ephemera from the turn-of-the-century in my dissertation. (The current version of London chapter itself includes a brief discussion of MacMillan's advertising campaign for Before Adam.) But for some reason I believe brittle and dessicated 98 year old newsprint to be more substantial than a webpage on a university server which has been up since (at least) 13 June 1997 and which has contained the text about London and social Darwinism since (at least) 15 August 2000. While I understand that the London site may disappear, the Wayback Machine shouldn't. (The Wayback Machine is a collaborative project with, among others, the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian. While based in San Fransisco, it has mirror sites around the world, so even if the unthinkable should happen to the entire United States, the electronic record of the webpages of its former citizens will be safe ... deep in the heart of the Middle East.)

Twice looks like a grudge. Update: The Washington Post informs us that &quot;Rita Upgraded to 'Monster' Category 5 Hurricane.&quot; (CNN confirms.) Has the National Hurricane Center always applied such adjectives to hurricanes? Can one Category 5 be &quot;beastly&quot; and another &quot;indifferent&quot;? Or are all Category 5 hurricanes &quot;Monster&quot; by definition? (I kid, frankly, because I don't like the alternative emotional responses.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/differences_wit.html"><span><strong>Differences without Distinctions: Another Post (sort of) about the Weather</strong> As Summer yields to the inconstant stress of Fall, I want to take a moment to reflect on what I've accomplished and press the muzzle of what I haven't firmly to my temple. Or maybe I should inhale deeply ... and again ... and again. Now I feel better. Crazed but better. I remind myself that the danger of a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 155 miles per hour differs only terminologically from the danger of a Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 160 miles per hours. As I begin to hyperventilate I remember that Rita is only history's third strongest hurricane and then I realize that I'm still blogging about the weather. Of all the things I never thought I'd launch into online permanence, the cliché which launched a thousand pointless conversations topped the list. Yet observe the depths to which I have so eagerly rappeled.[1] And so I offer Nature the following compromise: I will stop writing about the weather if you promise to stop churning out weather worth writing about. Deal? [1] While double-checking that I spelled &quot;rappel&quot; correctly I inadvertantly came across the entry for &quot;rapely,&quot; which means &quot;hastily, in haste, quickly.&quot; The chilling irony of the definition certainly offends, but not nearly so much as the selected quotation: &quot;Adam took Gamelyn, And ladde him rapely and anon.&quot; (Even when a footnote flees from hurricane Katrina and her horrible sister I still roll some disturbing die.)</span></a></div>
