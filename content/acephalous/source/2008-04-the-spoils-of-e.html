<p>Scenarios for gaining &quot;income&quot; at bottle center:</p>

<p>1. Personal bottles and cans (just clap your hands, just clap your hands):</p>

<p>I buy a six pack of Coca-Cola at Piggly Wiggly.  In addition to the 3.50 retail price of the soda and packaging I am buying, I  am required to put down 35 cent deposit for the cans or bottles I am taking with me, which I can reclaim upon bringing the bottles or cans back to any recycling center.  At that point I get my 35 cents back.   In the meantime, Piggly Wiggly&#39;s bank account has been accruing interest using my 35 cents, mind you.  </p>

<p>2. Collection of the discarded bottles and cans of others:</p>

<p>Other folks follow the above procedure, but they neglect to carry the containers to a recycling center.  They toss their cans into the wastestream, forfeiting their deposit.  I come along and collect the bottles and cans, carrying them back to the recycling center where I reclaim the deposit forfeited by another.  </p>

<p><br />
In either scenario, no one has worked for income! The 5 cents that I give for each bottle has already been taxed as part of my income, unless, of course someone out there buys their soda in a pre-tax deduction from the paycheck.  </p>

<p>If anyone should be taxed, it is the grocer who accumulates interest on my deposit money, or they should have to turn the interest back to me,  (or the state). </p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe that I sound like a liberatarian, but the idea that one would be taxed on the return of a deposit is insane!</p></span>

I've looked through my collections of slave-narratives and scoured Google Books, Project Gutenberg, JSTOR, &amp;c. and turned up nothing. As you might imagine, the reference links to recent talk of heredity and fingerprints: Did people believe calluses, or the propensity for developing useful ones, a heritable trait? Did they, following Galton, think fingerprints could be &quot;obliterated&quot; by calluses? The forgotten slave-narrative connects these questions to larger issues of race and passing in Pudd'nhead Wilson. It's been the linchpin of this section of the Twain chapter since I first outlined it. Only now I can't remember which one it is and will no doubt deprive myself of sleep until I do. For The Record: I normally resist the urge to ask for help by soldiering through deep waters alone. But I'm so frustrated now I can't even keep my metaphors strait. Or my homonyms. Plus my mistakes all reference drowning. It's not like last Tuesday when I spent four hours utterly incapable of remembering anything about Randolph Bourne except he was disabled and died young. That passed. This won't.</span></a></div>

Not that there's anything wrong with the article per se. It just fails to capture the existential horror of elevator entrapment. How would I know? Glad you asked. Three years ago, I spent the better part of an hour trapped in an elevator. I'd rushed to the Humanities Instructional Building to make some copies before an 8 a.m. class and so instead of bounding up four flights of stairs I chose to take the elevator.* The elevators in HIB have a hitch. They overshoot every floor by about an inch and then ... hang ... there ... for a few beats before settling down. You get used to it. So I pressed the button, flew up four stories and was hanging there for a few beats ... and then a few more ... and then a few more ... and so with great annoyance (feigned ostentatiously for a nonexistent audience) I pressed the &quot;Door Open&quot; button. But nothing happened. Then I tried to go to the second floor and pressed the button and it lit up. But nothing happened. So I hit the button with the fire and the ax on it. The one that requires a key to work. Because maybe if they knew someone was fucking with important buttons in the elevator they would send someone to reprimand them. But nothing happened. At this point I was about five minutes into my own hanging. The damn thing wouldn't settle and so I panicked. I started pacing frantically and I checked my watch and I knew I would be late for class because you know and why am I still hanging inches above my point of egress but then wait a minute I'm an inch from the floor I want to be on but am in fact floating in an elevator shaft four stories up with a two-thousand pound counterweight aimed at my head and maybe I ought to take a breath or two and consider the seriousness of my predicament and so with great consideration I jumped in the air and slammed my feet into the floor. I stomped and stomped thinking that I might loosen what normally unhitched and allowed the elevator to settle. Twenty minutes later I stopped. I figured the noise I'd made would alert someone that something was wrong with the elevators. It didn't. I resigned myself to skipping class on account of having the best of all possible excuses shortly after dismissing the possibility that there's only so much air in an elevator and there was no chance I'd suffocate and that the worse case scenario was that I'd drink my water and eat my granola bar and have to evacuate savagely into or onto an improvised something but despite the calm I convinced myself I felt it dawned on me that I was breathless and hyperventilating and that if this fucking...</span></a></div>
