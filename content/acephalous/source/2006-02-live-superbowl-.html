			<p>Kick off!&nbsp; Late flag.&nbsp; Looks like it may come back. </p>

<p>Here's the snap.&nbsp; Tries to turn the
corner.&nbsp; Great block on the point of attack.&nbsp; He was overdue to break
one.&nbsp; Now they want to pound it on the ground.&nbsp; They won't have much success if they get too one-dimensional.&nbsp; Pump fake.&nbsp; Looks like he's short.&nbsp; That'll be three and out.&nbsp; Here's the kicking team.&nbsp; </p>

<p>He calls for a fair catch.</p>

<p>They want to pass.&nbsp; He

<p>Punted off the side of his foot.&nbsp; Fair catch.<br /> </p>

<p>They want to establish the running game.&nbsp; Here's the snap.&nbsp; He picks up a little bit of a convoy.&nbsp; Now <em>that </em>is
smash-mouth football.&nbsp; Look at him run downhill.&nbsp; Great second effort.&nbsp; He keeps his legs
moving and big things happen.&nbsp; Now the defense knows it needs to
dominate the line of scrimmage.&nbsp; &nbsp;The front four have to tighten up.&nbsp; Here's the snap.&nbsp; You could have driven a truck through that hole! </p>

<p>They needs to make a stand here.&nbsp; They show blitz.&nbsp; He audiblizes.&nbsp; I

Pressure from the corners.&nbsp; He scrambles.&nbsp; The throw is on the money but
he must have heard footsteps.&nbsp; He's usually sure-handed.&nbsp; Only a minute left but a minute can be a lifetime.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Naked bootleg.&nbsp; Looks like it's just shy of the marker.&nbsp; The official waved his arms.&nbsp; The man upstairs will review it.&nbsp; They stripped him.&nbsp; There may be holding.&nbsp; Is he down by contact?&nbsp; Did his knee touch the ground?&nbsp; Did they whistle it dead?&nbsp; They can't afford to cough it up here.&nbsp; After further review it stands.&nbsp; </p>

<p>He wants to go deep.&nbsp; He has men in the slots.&nbsp; He pumps.&nbsp; Looks around.&nbsp; Sees his man.&nbsp; He has his man.&nbsp; They take him down from behind.&nbsp; He has to be upset.&nbsp; Say Al does all this patter suddenly seem homoerotic?&nbsp; Kiss me John . . . because as you always say whoever scores the most in the end wins.</p>

Duped By The Best</strong> After last night's &quot;spoofed dupe&quot; I decided that if I'm to be made a mockery it may as well be by someone I esteem. So I sat down and started reading the author for whom the phrase &quot;contempt for his readership&quot; hardly does justice to the cruelties he inflicts on it: Vladimir Nabokov. (Why do we become intellectual masochists when suffering from mental fatigue? I only hit the dizzingly self-conscious shelf when I'm physically beaten and mentally drained. There must be an explanation. If I could string three thoughts together I might even be able to smoke it out.) As I lazily re-read Pnin and Speak, Memory I tried to ignore my marginalia lest its cataloguing of authorial shenanigans interfere with the languid movement of my eyes across the page. The man cannot tell an unvarnished truth. He was mad for varnish and refused to write a single sentence which failed to embelish aurally its plain meaning. (On which more shortly.) He also despised prepackaged symbolism. Here he counters the psychoanalytic account of his work in Nabokov's Deceptive World by objecting that: Mr. Rowe's manipulating my most innocent words so as to introduce sexual &quot;symbols&quot; into them. The notion of symbol itself has always been abhorrent to me, and I never tire of retelling how I once failed a student—the dupe, alas, of an earlier teacher—for writing that Jane Austen describes leaves as &quot;green&quot; because Fanny is hopeful, and &quot;green&quot; is the color of hope. The symbolism racket in schools attracts computerized minds but destroys plain intelligence as well as poetical sense. It bleaches the soul. It numbs all capacity to enjoy the fun and enchantment of art. Who the hell cares, as Mr. Rowe wants us to care, that there is, according to his italics, a &quot;man&quot; in the sentence about a homosexual Swede who &quot;had embarrassing manners&quot; (p. 148), and another &quot;man&quot; in &quot;manipulate&quot; (passim)? &quot;Wickedly folded moth&quot; suggests &quot;wick&quot; to Mr. Rowe, and &quot;wick,&quot; as we Freudians know, is the Male Organ. &quot;I&quot; stands for &quot;eye,&quot; and &quot;eye&quot; stands for the Female Organ. Pencil licking is always a reference to you know what. A soccer goal hints at the vulval orifice (which Mr. Rowe evidently sees as square). I can think of no author whose words are more &quot;guilty&quot; than those of Nabokov . . . unless I think of Joyce. But Nabokov's words move in a more familiar register than Joyce's. You don't need fluency in forty-five languages to know when Nabokov pulls your leg. You need only experience the tingling Hey . . . wait a second which so many of his sentences induce to know that his sentence-level meaning is far from &quot;innocent.&quot; You don't even need to read the books to know he's about to dupe you. The titles alone tell all. Speak, Memory? Why must he enjoin his memory to speak instead of simply remembering? Especially considering his infamous hostility to &quot;the talking cure&quot;: I have ransacked my my oldest dreams for...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/own_up_or_if_yo.html"><span><strong>Own Up! Or, If You Wouldn't Mind Informing, We Would Be Much Obliged</strong> Normally I'm not overly nosey about my readership . . . but two groups among you kick-start my fancy: People who follow the link from my Valve contributor page. Are you of the &quot;Who in His Name Who Won't Be Taken In Vain does this 'Scott Eric Kaufman' think he is?&quot; school? Or do you belong to the the more deciduous suite who thinks I'm too forward and forthcoming and is only looking out for my best interest? Because I'm curious to tolerable torture why it is you click from there to here. People who arrive here via a Google search for &quot;hot monkey office sex.&quot; What exactly are you looking for? &quot;Hot monkeys&quot; who have sex in offices? Clerical liasons which border on the primatological? Which of those two adjectives takes precendence? Because hot office sex amongst thems who go at it like monkeys falls into the increasingly wide swath of &quot;acceptable pornographic fantisies.&quot; But monkeys who have &quot;hot sex&quot; in &quot;offices&quot; borders on the bestial and I don't want to be a part of it . . . nor does Google but since it doesn't involve tanks crushing democratic protesters I doubt you'll get a letter.</span></a></div>
