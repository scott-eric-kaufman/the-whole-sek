<p>I would observe: <em>the capacity of Royce Hall</em>.&nbsp; I would observe: <em>the characteristics of the audience</em>.&nbsp; I would observe: <em>Didion's hands as she spoke about the death of her husband</em>.</p>

<p>In two minutes Didion would take the stage.&nbsp; Almost all of the 1,834 seats had been filled but people still shuffled in.&nbsp; Royce Hall had been modeled after the San Ambrogio Church in Milan.&nbsp; Construction on San Ambrogio began in the 4th century.&nbsp; A south tower was added in the 9th.&nbsp; A north in the 12th.&nbsp; The 12th century oversaw a interior remodeling in the popular Romanesque style.&nbsp; The rolling terrain of the young UCLA campus suggested northern Italy to the architects.&nbsp; Three years later they had completed their Romanesque basilica.&nbsp; Of the Westwood campus' original four buildings it is the only one which stands unrenovated.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In the 15th Century Cardinal Ascanio Sforza ordered Bramante to add cloisters to the church.&nbsp; Sforza belonged to the ruling family of Milan.&nbsp; Its founder is rumored to have bent metal bars with his hands.&nbsp; Ascanio wanted to create what the 19th century American philosopher Josiah Royce would call &quot;a community of hope.&quot;&nbsp; The community would be &quot;constituted by the fact that each of its members accepts, as part of his own individual life and self, the same expected future events that each of his fellows accepts.&quot;&nbsp; The UCLA Fellows agreed with Royce and named a building after him.</p>

<p>The building was filled to near capacity.&nbsp; In the audience were many older Californians, fans of her work in the '60s and '70s and naturally sympathetic to the lose of a spouse or a child.&nbsp; &nbsp;They too would have lost someone, or soon will.&nbsp; There were also many younger women finding seats, asking men who had rolled joints in Berkeley in the '60s if they could squeeze by.&nbsp; Her long blonde hair brushed his arm as she passed and you knew from his face he didn't mind.&nbsp; He could imagine her in an iconic yellow bikini as the Vietnam War raged.&nbsp; He could remember when he read in 1979 that Didion was not &quot;the society in microcosm [but] a thirty-four-year-old woman with long straight hair and an old-fashioned bikini bathing suit and bad nerves sitting on an island in the middle of the Pacific waiting for a tidal wave that will not come.&quot;&nbsp; You could almost see him sniff the air in her wake.</p>

<p>That these young woman came to hear Didion speak initially surprised many.&nbsp; When Didion took to the stage she related how <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/140004314X/diesekoschmar-20">The Year of Magical Thinking</a> </em>had found her a new audience.&nbsp; &quot;People would come up and speak to me in the airport now,&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;They were younger than I expected, more interested in my marriage than his death.&quot;&nbsp; As she said this none of the young women present looked embarassed or disturbed.&nbsp; None of them shifted in their seats at her statement.&nbsp; None of them were more interested in Didion's marriage than her loss.&nbsp; &quot;We are not allowed to dwell on death,&quot; she said.&nbsp; Some of them did.</p>

<p>During the Question &amp; Answer segment one stepped to the microphone.&nbsp; &quot;I was friends with Quintana Roo in high school.&nbsp; She was a beautiful person.&nbsp; Will you write a book about that too?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I hadn't thought about that,&quot; Didion lied.&nbsp; When asked by the <em>New York Times </em>whether she would change <em>The Year of Magical Thinking </em>to reflect her daughter's death, she had said &quot;It's finished.&quot;&nbsp; Her lie seemed more a product of surprise than deliberation.&nbsp; She had not expected to see a young woman, one Quintana may have brought home one day, one who if she thought long enough she could remember, or imagine she remembered, streaking through the kitchen to inform her daughter of some urgent triviality.&nbsp; She said &quot;I hadn't thought about that.&quot;</p>

<p>Of her craft and life she said &quot;I stopped caring about hiding things.&nbsp; My style is about withholding information.&nbsp; Or it was.&nbsp; Now I wanted to be direct.&quot;&nbsp; When a woman in the Q &amp; A informed her that &quot;I have a severe learning disability, I can barely read, but I love your books,&quot; she smiled kindly and said &quot;It must be the very large typeface.&nbsp; They want me to write in a very large typeface.&quot;&nbsp; Unless the typeface is unusual publishers will not inform their patrons of its name.&nbsp; <em>Play It As It Lays </em>is &quot;Designed by Guy Fleming.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Book design by Iris Weinstein&quot; graces the copyright page of <em>Political Fictions</em>.&nbsp; On back cover you find &quot;Author photograph © Quintana Roo.&quot;</p>

<p>The death of her daughter will figure more prominently in the stage adaptation of <em>The Year of Magical Thinking</em>.&nbsp; Despite being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Didion">known</a> &quot;as a journalist, playwright, essayist, and novelist,&quot; this is &quot;the first stage play I've written.&quot;&nbsp; She has collaborated with her late husband on numerous screenplays, but this is different.&nbsp; &quot;There is no investment,&quot; she says of writing screenplays, &quot;because you know someone else will come and ruin it.&quot;&nbsp; The only screenplay she still likes and could, but never will, re-read is for <em>Ice Queen</em>.&nbsp; It was never filmed.&nbsp; <em>The Year of Magical Thinking </em>will be a one-woman monologue.&nbsp; She hopes, but doubts,&nbsp; it will find an audience.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&quot;I never even go to the theater.&quot;&nbsp; <br /> </p>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/friday_random_t.html"><span><strong>Friday Random Ten</strong> After thinking about &quot;Friday Random Ten&quot; as an aesthetic phenomenon, it seems silly not to slap one up there myself. I'm normally no fan of the routine blog post—as evidenced by the couple I've concocted that've fallen by the wayside—but that has more to do with the &quot;length&quot; of my attention span. A few iterations and I'm bored with it. This window into my iRiver's soul will slam shut sooner than later: Clem Snide - &quot;Action&quot; The Pogues - &quot;If I Should Fall From Grace With God&quot; Dave Van Ronk &amp; Frankie Armstrong - &quot;The Legend of the Dead Soldier&quot; Sleater-Kinney - &quot;I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone&quot; The Jayhawks - &quot;Wichita&quot; Django Reinhardt - &quot;H.C.Q. Strut&quot; Wilco - &quot;Box Full of Letters&quot; Blonde Redhead - &quot;Without Feathers&quot; Drive By Truckers - &quot;Lookout Mountain&quot; Grant Lee Buffalo - &quot;Lonestar Song&quot; What have I learned? To believe in Random. At least one-third of my iRiver consists of Jeff Tweedy-related albums, bootlegs, demos, solo- and side- projects. What ends up on my only ever Random Ten? One mediocre track from Wilco's only mediocre album. Not that there aren't some fortuitous entries: When Holbo was out here last week I actually mentioned Grant Lee Buffalo's &quot;Lonestar Song.&quot; Scott McLemee will dig the appearance by the Drive By Truckers. The Pogues' &quot;If I Should Fall From Grace With God&quot; is the best song off the album of the same name. The Dave Van Ronk &amp; Frankie Armstrong album full of Brecht covers is as good as it seems pretentious. More people should own it. Same with the Jayhawks' Hollywood Town Hall. Sleater-Kinney's &quot;I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone,&quot; while not one of my favorite songs, at least comes from their best period ('95-'99). The list is odd in many respects, however. There's no rap or hip-hop. In fact there aren't any African-American performers on it. It seems I own a racist iRiver. Anyone know if there's a firmware upgrade for that?</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/noneclectic_ecl.html"><span><strong>Non-Eclectic Eclecticism</strong> In response to comments on Friday's Random Ten, I wonder if the class would like to discuss why so many academics have such similar taste in music. Dr. Virago, Belle Lettre, Lauren, Craig and Jon all correspond to different colors in the leftist intellectual rainbow. Yet if they ask their portable .mp3 players to speak they do so with one voice. (Which apparently sounds much like Jeff Tweedy's circa Summerteeth.) How is it that thinkers who pledge allegiance to Green have the same taste in music as those who espouse undying love of Blue? And what are we to make of the Reds and the Yellows? How did this strange state affairs come to be? Common roots? Were we outcasts all in high school? Does reading too much at too young an age predispose us to love of Morrissey and &quot;alternative country&quot;? An article about Morrissey's wild popularity in Mexico claimed that Mexicans love him because of the melodramatic ambiguity of his lyrics.* Is that why we love him? &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot; [edited to refelct the fact that I confuse the lyrics with the title of that song] moved my adolescent heart via its elegant and articulate bombast. Why did it cause yours to skip a beat? Why does the answer to that question have anything to do with Theory? I'm not sure. But perhaps we can tease out some sub-sub-sub-cultural distinctions which will account for our apparent similarities in musical taste. Do those who favor theoretical eclecticism tend more toward experimental music? Or do they also have a soft spot for Springsteen's working class epic &quot;The River&quot;? Why (hypothetically) can they abide by Morrissey but not Springsteen? &amp;c. *At a concert in Arizona, Morrissey told the largely Latino audience that they could stay for the concert but would have to return to Mexico at its conclusion. As Gustavo Arellano noted, &quot;Only one white man in the world—and he's not the Pope—can tell a group of Mexicans in the United States to return to Mexico and not only avert death, but be loved for saying so.&quot;</span></a></div>
