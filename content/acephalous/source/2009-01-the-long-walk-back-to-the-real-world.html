I don’t mean <em>generally</em>, because <em>generally</em> the answer is they don’t think about their media consumption any more than your average liberal. I mean <em>specifically</em>, that is, when they do consider how the media they consume intersects with the beliefs they profess, what happens? Thanks to <a><em>Andrew Breitbart</em></a>,
we now have a daily glut of valuable insight into what it is to be a
conservative for whom music, literature and film don’t nadir after
Beethoven, Shakespeare and Bogart. Admittedly, some of the revelations
are old hat, as with <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/abreitbart/2009/01/11/my-first-assignment-gone-baby-gone/">Breitbart’s confession</a> of how certain conservatives really feel about the working poor:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whoever cast the Boston grotesques that littered the
film, my hat’s off to you. These profoundly ugly people really created
a backdrop that made you want to root for the kid not to be found and
brought back to her natural origins.</p></blockquote>
<p>But most of <em>Big Hollywood</em> is so awesomely counter-intuitive
Walter Benn Michaels wouldn’t touch it with your ten-foot pole. Exhibit
A: Evan Sayet’s post on <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/esayet/2009/01/09/bruce-springsteen-one-hundred-percent-republican/">Bruce Springsteen’s secret conservatism</a>, in which he claims</p>
<blockquote><p>that, while Springsteen the multimillionaire, rock star
with the mansion in Beverly Hills may be a Liberal, Bruce Springsteen
the poet is one-hundred percent Republican.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those of you currently reading Dante in your sophomore English
classes take note: Sayet someone out. Not that I need to tell you this,
but the <em>Commedia</em> is written by Dante the Man about Dante the Pilgrim <em>as narrated by Dante the Poet</em>. The Poet is the fiction’s conceit—the character who remembers and recalls what happened after he found himself <em>per una selva oscura</em>—and
is not to be treated coextensive with Dante the Man. I invoke Dante
here because Springsteen, like Dante, is frequently confused for his
narrators by people who should know better. No one reads “<a href="http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/267.html">Caliban upon Setebos</a>”
and mistakes the theological musings of Prospero’s deformed manservant
for a definitive statement of Browning’s philosophy; whereas with
Springsteen, every word his narrators utter is an expression of his
personal beliefs <em>even when</em> he opens with a lyric like “<a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/HighwayPatrolman.html">[m]y name is Joe Roberts</a>.” </p><p>
</p></div></div>

<p><span id="more-6768"></span></p>
<p>By these lights, Springsteen the Poet is a conservative because Joe
Roberts believes a “man [who] turns his back on his family, well, he
just ain’t no good.” As that belief plugs neatly into the fallacy
whereby family values are conservative values are Republican values,
Springsteen the Poet would’ve been besotted by Sarah Palin and voting
for John McCain. If that sounds simple-minded, you likely won’t be
impressed by Sayet’s Sowell-lite philosophizing: liberals believe “man
is born good and then corrupted by the institutions of society,”
whereas conservatives believe “man is born with a dual and conflicting
nature—capable of good and evil and everything in between—requiring
cultural forces to help him tamp down the darker side and cultivate the
good within.” By these druthers, any song in which options are weighed
lilts conservative; any song that narrates the selection of the correct
option must, therefore, be the product of a conservative mindset. A
song like “Imagine” is liberal because if there are no countries and no
religions there is nothing to kill or die for—that is, without some
system of belief around to adjudicate the merits of a decision, no
choice is any more or less meaningful than any other. Do what <em>feels</em> right replaces do what <em>is</em> right, and since doing wrong feels so right why don’t we do it in the road? To Sayet’s mind, </p>
<blockquote><p>Springsteen . . . holds the diametrically opposed—Conservative—vision of man’s nature:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two faces have I.<br />
One that laughs, one that cries.<br />
One says “hello,” one says “goodbye.”<br />
One says things I don’t understand.<br />
Makes me feel like half a man.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since Springsteen recognizes that his feelings are conflicted, far
from seeking the destruction of the civilizing forces, these are the
things he specifically turns to for guidance:</p>
<blockquote><p>At night I get down on my knees and pray<br />
I want to make that other man go away.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Couple of points to make here: first, Springsteen is a recovering Catholic; second, <em>Springsteen is a recovering Catholic</em>. Has Sayet never met a recovering Catholic before? Because <em>Tunnel of Love</em> may be the quintessential statement of recovering Catholicism in the latter half of the last century. Just ask <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Z83RmRyZ63kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22it+ain%27t+no+sin+to+be+glad+you%27re+alive%22&amp;ei=coxrSeGjGYrUkwSZpPGBDg&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA189,M1">Walker Percy</a>. Pick as many cherries as you like—and Sayet <em>loves</em> cherries—you cannot turn Springsteen into an organization man:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fairly early in Springsteen’s career, in the song “<a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/Badlands.html">Badlands</a>,”
the Conservative poet takes a moment to contemplate what will bring him
happiness in life. He then runs through the usual possibilities, from
losing oneself in his work to the accruing of fabulous riches, only to
decide in the end that is “Faith that can save me.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Strangely, Sayet fails to quote the song’s most famous lyric:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the ones who had a notion,<br />
A notion deep inside.<br />
That it ain’t no sin<br />
To be glad you’re alive . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Except, were Springsteen the Catholic Sayet wants him to be, <em>it would be</em>.
Catholic’s have this funny idea about babies and the taint of sin—life
is a journey, see, from sin to salvation, and this journey starts the
moment you find yourself in <em>una selva oscura</em> . . . but I’m
not here to quibble about Catholic doctrine. I concede that
Springsteen’s thought was shaped by his Catholic upbringing. I’ll even
concede that the confessional <em>métier</em> imparted by a Catholic
upbringing makes for some fine art. However, I steadfastly insist that
writing songs in which your narrator feels conflicted does not a
conservative make. Misunderstanding fairly straightforward lyrics,
hower . . . </p>
<blockquote><p>Springsteen sees the constraints of the Constitution as good, right and essential:</p>
<blockquote><p>See that flag flying over the courthouse?<br />
It says certain things are set in stone.<br />
Who we are, what we’ll do and what we won’t.</p></blockquote>
<p>The combination of Catholic imagery and American iconography stand
in stark contrast to the Neo-Liberal Lennon whose Utopian dreams
require the dismantling of these things—of all codes and creeds beyond
doing what feels good at any moment</p></blockquote>
<p>Sayet correctly identifies Springsteen’s reverance for classical American iconography, but he misses <em>the entire point of the song</em>.
Those words are not spoken by the narrator—they don’t even appear in
the song, actually, but I’m not here to nitpick about misquotation—they
are spoken <em>to</em> the narrator <em>by</em> his father. In “<a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/LongWalkHome.html">Long Walk Home</a>,”
Springsteen’s narrator returns to the town where he was born and finds
it in disrepair. The local grocery and barbarshop are still there, but
they’re manned and patonized by “rank strangers.” The diner is dust.
The veteran’s hall stands “silent and alone.” <em>Then</em> the narrator recalls what his father told him: </p>
<blockquote><p>My father said,<br />
“Son, we’re lucky in this town.<br />
It’s a beautiful place to be born.<br />
It just wraps its arms around you,<br />
Nobody crowds you, nobody goes it alone.<br />
You know that flag flying over the courthouse?<br />
Means certain things are set in stone.<br />
Who we are, what we’ll do and what we won’t.”</p></blockquote>
<p>You don’t need my crack skills as a professional interpreter of
words to recognize what Springsteen is up to here: the town through
which the narrator currently walks, with its shuttered businesses and
lonely veterans, resembles the town his father described in name alone.
Via a simple grammatical exercise, this point can be made abundantly
clear. Since the father’s statements were made in the past, I will put
them in the past tense:</p>
<blockquote><p>My father said,<br />
“Son, we <strong>were</strong> lucky in this town.<br />
It <strong>was</strong> a beautiful place to be born.<br />
It just <strong>wrapped</strong> its arms around you,<br />
Nobody <strong>crowded</strong> you, nobody <strong>went</strong> it alone.<br />
You know that flag flying over the courthouse?<br />
<strong>Meant</strong> certain things <strong>were</strong> set in stone.<br />
Who we <strong>were</strong>, what we <strong>would’ve done</strong> and what we <strong>wouldn’t have done</strong>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The last line clunks something awful, but the point should be clear:
he doesn’t believe in the permanence of community or the continuity of
shared cultural values. The song documents how fragile the order his
father cherished actually was. The narrator wouldn’t return to his
hometown and note that “it’s gonna be a long walk home” if “home”
possessed the timeless virtues Sayet attributes to it. What we have
here, then, is a succinct example of the conservative break from
reality:</p>
<p>A town falls to shit. </p>
<p>A person notes that the town fell to shit and remembers what his father told him the town was like. </p>
<p>A conservative comes along, examines the town, declares the father correct and attributes the sentiment to the son. </p>
<p>“You and me, Bruce,” the conservative tells the son. “We’re alike.”</p>
<p>“I’m not Bruce.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you are.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not.”</p>
<p>“Whatever. All that matters is you’re really just like me.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think what you think I think,” he replies.</p>
<p>“But you just—you just now said—you talked about how wonderful your hometown is.”</p>
<p>“Was.”</p>
<p>“Wrong! I was listening. You spoke in the present tense.”</p>
<p>“I <em>remembered</em> in the present tense.”</p>
<p>“You <em>remembered</em> how great this town is.”</p>
<p>“Was.”</p>
<p>“IS!”</p>
<p>“Was.”</p>
<p>“IS IS IS!”</p>
<p>“Was.”</p>
<p>“IS IS IS INFINITY NO TAKE BACKS!”</p>

I think the message is that people who talk about politics should be careful about talking about art.  Because if you talk about art then a man whose job it is to interpret art will make you sad.  That is because he will say you are doing it wrong.  </p>

<p>Say rather that Headless is talking about Bruce Springsteen et al. in order to make a point about another man talking about bullshit (i.e. politics).</p>

		<span id="comment-144974554-content"><p>Thank you for taking the time to read my piece on Springsteen.  While I don&#39;t quite grasp your analysis -- how does being GLAD you&#39;re alive have anything to do with &quot;original sin?&quot; -- I enjoyed your writing.  </p>

<p>Further, even if it was the fatther speaking in the past tense -- an odd call since he&#39;s speaking in the PRESENT tense -- the point remains that what is set in stone is set in stone whether times are good or bad and that it is the failure of the Neo-liberal generation to have ANYTHING set in stone (except that if it FEELS good, do it) that has brought on society&#39;s decline.  It&#39;s the Greatest Generation talking to the Me  Generation and,  yes, it&#39;s a long walk home to the America of values and beliefs.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-145099086-content"><p>I really think that all cultural consumption and media consumption has &quot;biases and filters&quot; that alter reality in ways that the adherants understand and the detractors are unable to recognize. And I would think that there are more than just two of these, not merely one being liberal and the other conservative. Neither group is as monolithic as its critics suggest, but the respective stereotypes are interesting to invoke and watch the screams arise from the targeted group. </p>

<p>Except that&#39;s not getting to be much fun anymore, if it ever was. </p>

<p>It appears to be the yin and yang of consumption. Want a totally objective person? They don&#39;t exist. Except maybe in their own mind.</p></span>

This is just a tribute. Via S, N!) I first got into HBO’s hit television program The Wired about two years ago. A stranger mentioned it to the person in front of him at the 700 Club cafeteria, and by the time I finished the first episode, I knew I would be telling people I was completely hooked. (This, by the way, is my Recruitment Rule for The Wired: watch the first four minutes. If you don’t like it by then, dump out.) I am so excited by my enthusiasm for the show, in fact, that I often tout the first episode of The Wired as the best show in the history of television. I don’t simply love this episode for its terrific acting, wonderful writing, quirkly plotting, or mind-boggling twists. I also love it because of its subtle conservatism. Here are the top five conservative characters on the first episode of The Wired. Beware—SPOILERS INCLUDED. 1. William Rawls: John Doman’s tough Homicide investigator, William Rawls, is the top conservative character on television, bar none. Rawls is a real man’s man, a true paragon of conservative integrity. He knows that America is a meritocracy and, according to Wikipedia, in Season 4 openly attacks the reverse racism of affirmative action by proving that, instead of working up the ranks honestly like he has, the blacks in the Baltimore Police Department were recruited up the chain of command because of the color of their skin. This racism created a leadership vacuum, and like true conservatives, Rawls knows the value of a true leader of men. He may not always love the men beneath him, but he knows they need discipline and is determined to give it to them. 2. Jimmy McNulty: If every public servant showed McNulty’s commitment to civic duty, we would never have heard the odious phrase “President-Elect Obama” said without a snigger. In this episode alone, McNulty attends a trial when he could have been at home and stays up all night to make sure his report is on his deputy’s desk at 0800 clean and with no typos. Here he is in a clip from Season 2, going above and beyond the call of duty: He’s also a family man who wants nothing more than the judge to give him more than three out of four weekends with his children. 3. Snot Boogie: Every Friday night, anonymous young black men would roll bones behind the Cut Rate, and every Friday night, Snot Boogie would wait until there was cash on the ground, grab it, and run away. Snot Boogie knew these games were unsanctioned and bravely confiscated the illegal proceeds even though he knew the young black men would catch him and beat his ass. To do what you know to be right, no matter the consequence, is a true conservative value. 4. The Anonymous Young Black Men behind the Cut Rate: The anonymous young black men behind...</span></a></div>

First, the sentiment is utterly inane. Second, only had he danced while driving a car do I even see how the first bit relates to the rest of the sentence. Third, the next sentence begins: On July 13, 2008, police entered [his] Long Beach apartment after receiving calls from neighbors who had noticed a strong smell emanating from [his] home. Utterly inane is to be expected. Boilerplate newswire prose in a memorial is not. The AP Style Guide neither loves no one and remembers no one. Don't invite it to the wake. Know what else doesn't? Cheap shots: [He] was consistently five to 10 minutes late to class, and he would pause his lectures to go outside and smoke a cigarette. I could list a few more of his professional failings, but I'm not about to do it while commenting on his memorial. (Much less were I writing it.) His liberal political views infiltrated his teaching style, a bias that many students found refreshing, but others found abrasive. True enough. But true enough that we ought to let his detractors have the last word? No. And yet: One student interpreted [his] political theories and observations as Marxism and believed that the professor's liberal bias was excessive and unnecessary. The memorial veers from boilerplate newswire prose to boilerplate conservative kvetching in under five paragraphs. I'm not sure whether I should be more offended by the callousness of the editorial staff or the audacity of the anonymous student Horowitzing about his grades in a memorial.</span></a></div>
