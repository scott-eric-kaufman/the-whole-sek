the Baldwin Effect in Jack London’s <em>The Iron Heel </em>and <em>Before Adam</em></strong></p>

<p>Jack London was branded by 
association the moment Richard Hofstadter’s <em>Social Darwinism in American Thought</em> hit 
the shelves. One of the earliest reviews 
recounted a session of the American Sociological Society devoted to Social 
Darwinism. The reviewer notes that “none 
of [the participants] went in for any such vociferous and belligerent 
discipleship as did Jack London.” Readers of London’s youthful exchanges with his friend Cloudesley Johns 
would consider this association appropriate: a twenty-four year-old London 
declared himself “An Evolutionist, believing in Natural Selection, half 
believing Mathus’ ‘Law of Population,’ and a myriad of other factors thrown in, 
[who] cannot but hail as unavoidable, the Black and the Brown going down before 
the White.” According to William E. 
Cain, this sentence—first published Joan London’s <em>Jack London and His Times </em>(1939) and a 
longtime staple of the London industry—is 
evidence that “London is quick to express his social 
Darwinism.” Such assessments 
overestimate the coherence of evolutionary theory during what Stephen Jay Gould 
has called the “decade of maximal agnosticism and diversity in evolutionary 
theories.” Strictly speaking, social 
Darwinism did not exist. The 
evolutionary zeitgeist is more accurately called “social Spencerianism,” for it 
is the teleological thought of Herbert Spencer, not the radical randomness of 
Darwinian natural selection, which informs the politics and literature of the 
period. Absent from most accounts is the 
teleology inherent in Spencer’s dictum that development marches from the 
homogeneous to the heterogeneous.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In 
“Telic Action and Collective Stupidity” (1902), London describes how “the individual is capable 
of, and does perform, telic actions—that is, adjusts his acts to remote ends; a 
thing which society never does.” He 
laments the stupidity of the crowd, here functioning metonymically for society 
at large, which despite being composed of individuals capable of telic action, 
<em>en masse</em> behave as if such feats of 
foresight are impossible. Although he 
posits no solution to this problem, he strikes one optimistic note: it is 
possible for “two or three individuals, or a score, [to] organize a company or 
corporation and collectively perform telic actions.” Telic actions cannot be performed by 
acephalous organizations; democracy is hamstrung by “by the arrant idiocy of 
political organization.” Such actions 
can only be undertaken by undemocratic organizations whose leaders are chosen 
not because they represent society at large, but because they do not. They are superior, and will influence society 
by means of what is called “the Baldwin Effect,” according to which Lamarckian 
inheritance works alongside natural selection in the human population. Great leaders accelerate the teleological 
process London 
believed was already at work: namely, that “from the facts of [human] 
history…the trend of [social] development is toward greater and greater 
collective wisdom.” For him, the 
amelioration of suffering via socialism could not happen soon enough. During this talk, I will demonstrate how 
London’s 
impatience with the pace of evolution compels him to advocate Baldwinian logic 
in the two novels he wrote during 1906, <em>The Iron Heel </em>and <em>Before Adam</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I was told that it&#39;s not customary to give a paper when it has been accepted for publication -- that doesn&#39;t apply here (yet), but subsequent experience has taught me that when a paper is accepted, there is really <i>absolutely no danger</i> of it appearing within a year.</p></span>

<p>Adam, I&#39;ve never heard that.  I have heard a number of people remark off-hand that this is from their forthcoming book or article.  Stupid academic niceties ... fortunately, I&#39;m only in the sending-it-out stage, so even if it gets accepted, it&#39;ll be a good long while before it&#39;ll appear in a journal only libraries can afford to buy.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-72999360-content"><p>1) It&#39;s fine to give a paper that&#39;s out for publication, or even accepted but not published, but it&#39;s bad form to give one that&#39;s been published. Not horribly bad form, but not recommended, especially if the scenario is one that matters in some way. (Giving a paper you&#39;ve published, say, at a minor grad conference isn&#39;t really a big deal. At MLA, maybe it would be... A job talk should always be work that is currently underway and not published.) </p>

<p>2) Sometimes people say they don&#39;t like the &quot;under review&quot; category. Personally, I do put &quot;under review&quot; papers on my CV. If you haven&#39;t been accepted for publication anywhere when you go out for your first job, I definitely think it would be best to list a few papers &quot;under review.&quot; </p>

<p>One thing not to do, probably, is to have a CV category called &quot;Published Papers&quot; that contains <i>only</i> papers that are under review. Call it something else (just &quot;Papers&quot; perhaps...) It does point out the fact that you are currently trying to publish, and gives a sense of what you&#39;ve been working on... Don&#39;t list the journal where it&#39;s under review though. If it gets gonged, you don&#39;t want to answer the question of the status of your paper at Journal X. (That is, if it gets gonged, a manila envelope and postage will make it under review again instantly...) </p></span>

You leave the racial comment just lying there.  Was this a theory of racial absorbtion as Skidmore describes for Brazil (with some interesting U.S. connections), or simply of racial supremacy in evolutionary garb?  I trust that in the larger paper you address somehow how London&#39;s racial thought fit into the larger crazy quilt of his evolutionary thinking.  (So, society is stupid, but humanity has ever greater collective wisdom? Huh?)</p></span>

It had been front and center -- my dissertation started as an examination of race and liberalism in the &#39;30s, and only gradually drifted back to the &#39;00s -- but London&#39;s theories on race are unexamined, dull commonplaces.  There&#39;s nothing unique about them.  Not that they don&#39;t evolve as he matures -- in <em>The Iron Heel</em>, written six years after that letter to Johns, he expresses his belief that each of the races will ascend, through socialism, such that they are on equitable terms, evolutionarily and revolutionarily speaking -- but that he doesn&#39;t examine them in any great detail until the South Pacific books, which were written much later (and are outside the scope of my project, which focuses on evolutionary thought before the ascent of the eugenics).</p></span>

		<span id="comment-73262474-content"><p>OK, I know that this is/was a paper proposal, and I&#39;ve certainly included elements in some of mine that I knew I wouldn&#39;t be able to follow up on, but the &quot;the Black and the Brown going down before the White” line practically jumps off the page/screen and begs for somekind of follow up.  You obviously don&#39;t want to do that kind of following up right now (leave the chapter the hell alone, he writes, trying to follow such advice himself), but it does seem potentially worthwhile later on, just because, in the pre-eugenics period, racial thought is considerably more diverse and cross pollinating with a variety of scientific and biblical debates.  If you haven&#39;t read it already, I would recommend adding Thomas Skidmore&#39;s classic _Black into White_ to your eventual reading pile.  Skidmore doesn&#39;t have Theodore Roosevelt reporting on Brazilian theories of whitening to a U.S. public until 1914, but I would suspect that there is a more difuse spread of ideas on evolutionary solutions to the race problem in the decades before that.</p></span>

This is a problem. Cranes have been hired. Expect replies shortly. So long as I'm apologizing, I wonder if anyone knows how to convert a song ripped in iTunes into an .mp3. After I lost my hard copy of Leonard Cohen's Songs of Love and Hate—his best, by far—I downloaded it through iTunes ... which means I can't import it into my newly purchased generic .mp3 player. Now, neither my original rips nor the iTunes files work, and damn it, if I can't listen to it, I'm living for nothing now, and am keeping, no kinds of records. I also misconverted all my episodes of In Our Times, so if you have any about and some bandwidth to spare, I'd love to reconnect with my collection. If I can't learn about epistolary novels most immediately, I'll ensconce myself in that cupboard until Mr. B. uses wiles to release me. Gifts: Leonard Cohen, Master Song, So Long Marianne, Stranger Song.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/paging_dr_freud.html"><span><strong>Paging Dr. Freud</strong> &quot;Making up&quot; was the most essential activity of Pussy Jones' childhood: &quot;Making up&quot; began for her when [she] was four or five, and the family had just moved to Europe. She had begun inventing stories before then—from the moment she could remember, in fact—but now she &quot;found the necessary formula.&quot; The &quot;formula&quot; is described very precisely: it was ritualistic, solitary and very physical. She had to have a book in her hands, preferably with lots of thick black type, and she would walk rapidly up and down in an &quot;ecstasy&quot; of invention, turning the pages as if reading, regardless of whether the book was upside down or not, and improvising out loud, and very fast, an imaginary story ... Her account of &quot;the ecstasy which transported my little body&quot; is extremely erotic: there is evidently something masturbatory and orgasmic about these &quot;enraptured sessions.&quot; When Pussy Jones* writes of &quot;making up&quot; in her unpublished novel Literature, she does so through the character of a young boy who, of course, she christens &quot;Dick Thaxter.&quot; Names are important. Lacan said so. To relate something I wrote back before you read me—when I thought differently about psychoanalysis, and a mere two days after I announced the arrival of a fantastic new blog—a Lacanian with whom I briefly shared an office once told me: Lacan thought seriously about names and their effect on development. I don't see anything wrong with teaching a lesson in a freshman composition class on how Richard Caputo's politics derive from the fact that he is, nominally and probably actually too, a &quot;dick head.&quot; In light of this, I can only conclude that Pussy rewriting her masturbatory &quot;make up&quot; sessions as a Dick extremely significant. Would that I knew how. *Better known by her given and married names, Edith Wharton. The quote is from Hermione Lee's new biography, which is as good as advertised. In one of those tangled online coincidences, a search for &quot;Hermione Lee&quot; on the LRB site returns her review of this book, currently gracing my sidebar; even more tangled and coincidental, a search for &quot;Edith Wharton&quot; returns a host of articles written by a woman of no small recent interest. The internet is not as large as it looks. At the very least, today it contains the allusive density of a dream. How very apropos.</span></a></div>
