In other words, I don't disapprove of Morrison's grand scheme so much as I think its philosophical underpinnings are as sound and stable as those of anyone else who drops too much acid and claims communion with unseen entities of vast esoteric power. They—being the philosophical underpinnings, not the unseen entities of vast esoteric power—are there, certainly, but they're there to be accepted as revelation, not to be argued with. That said, I decided to teach All-Star Superman anyway and will attempt to do it justice. Fortunately for me, that's not too difficult to do if I concentrate on the opening pages of the first issue.

(Or because, despite its familiarity, it <em>is </em>moving.)&#0160;In eight words evenly distributed over four panels, Morrison captures the oft-forgotten pathos of the character.</p>
<p>How does Morrison effect this? By creating an alternating rhythm to the panels. The first depicts a world-historical catastrophe; the second, a medium close-up of two people caught in it; the third, the catastrophe again; the fourth, a first-person extreme close-up of two people whose lives are changed by it. The balance created by alternating between the catastrophic scale in the first and third panels emphasizes, by putting into relief, the personal scale evident in the second and fourth. Put differently: the pained faces in the second panel are both magnified and humanized by the events depicted in the panels bookending it. Similarly, the inquisitive faces in the fourth panel are made meaningful both by the third and the splash page that follows:</p>

It&#39;s almost as if the Kents&#39; curiosity on the previous page is answered by the magnificance depicted on the two subsequent ones. (The visual impact of the second and third pages is diminished by the necessities of blog-columns, but if you click on the images they should open in their original sizes.) In short, the book opens with symmetry (page one) and transitions to sublime grace (pages two and three), which perfectly prepares the reader for this:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0154363410af970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="04" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0154363410af970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0154363410af970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="04" /></a><br />I&#39;m going to avoid plot-points I don&#39;t entirely understand and stick with the visuals, beginning with the basics: which panel is the first panel? The page. But in conventional superhero comics, pages rarely function as panels, because conventional superhero comics are orderly and the job of being panels belongs to the panels. (The exception being fights splashed onto pages, but even in those cases rarely do other panels tumble down the side as these do here.) The point being: the symmetry and grace of the preceding pages is disrupted by a page that can&#39;t even control its own panels. The calamity befalling the characters in the second through fourth panels doesn&#39;t belong to or in the harmonious universe previously described. They&#39;re &quot;falling into a sunspot the size of South America&quot; precisely as the pilot in the first panels describes. Like much of Morrison&#39;s work, they&#39;re performing their own meaning. So too are the panels on the next page:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e8c545242970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="05" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e8c545242970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e8c545242970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="05" /></a><br />The page again functions as the first panel, but in this case, the panels it contains are orderly. They may not fit a convention 9- or 6-panel scheme, but they&#39;re equidistant from both edges of the page and neatly organized in its central area. Did I say neatly? I meant obsessively: if we were to draw lines up from each panel it becomes evident that Frank Quitely has placed them in such a manner as to frame her face:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e8c545c99970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Lines05" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e8c545c99970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e8c545c99970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Lines05" /></a><br />The second panel occupies the same width on the page as her hair. The third stops at the inward edge of her right nostril and the fourth begins at the inward edge of her left. The fifth frames the outside of her left ear and extends to the edge of her hair. (I alternated the line on the right edge of the second panel and the left edge of the fifth because it&#39;s impossible to see the ears they&#39;re framing beneath the lines otherwise.) This orderly composition of this page counterpoises the disorderly tumbling of the previous, and with good reason: that&#39;s what Superman does. He restores order when the universe threatens to upset it. Morrison again has his form mirror his content (and vice versa). He wants the reader to both see and understand Superman&#39;s function in his fictional universe.&#0160;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that Morrison takes it seriously, it&#39;s how seriously he takes it.  The irony being, of course, that I still admire Moore, who also takes his magic very, very seriously.  I think the difference is that Morrison&#39;s cosmology seems thin and under-thought: he feels, for example, to define the term &quot;metafiction&quot; in <em>Supergods</em> in the way that an undergraduate, flush with an encounter with a new idea, would.  There&#39;s no depth to the contemplation, just random encounters with drugs, aliens, magic, and the comic metaverse. </p></span>

Yes, his work often seems to be underthought.  _Animal Man_, I remember, had a long-running plot about Animal Man becoming involved in the animal rights movement, until the issue where he turns away from them, idealism betrayed, angry that they want to use him as a soldier.  And that was it.  It was like something that could have been written by an 18 year old.  _Doom Patrol_ was great, but it had trouble actually going anywhere.  As you can tell by these examples, there are whole decades of Morrison I&#39;ve skipped.</p>

<p>I do think that this quality is the reason why he&#39;s made it so (comparatively) big out of the Brit Invasion writers in the classic superhero comics world.  I did read _Seven Soldiers_, and was astounded by how Morrison in the intro page seemingly unironically writes about turning the characters into salable properties, ready for their own individual series.  It&#39;s not that he&#39;s selling out.   It&#39;s just like he hasn&#39;t really thought about it.</p></span>

<p>Rather, that he isn&#39;t bothered by selling out or considers it particularly shameful to be commercially minded in some of his more &quot;mainstream&quot; projects.</p>

<p>Regarding Animal Man and Doom Patrol, you shouldn&#39;t really look at these as longform works, as both were written at a time when the monthly floppy was king and clearly written from month to month. There never was an overall arch for either of them and especially Animal Man is Morrison mucking about doing things that interested him that month; attempt to read it as a coherent story in trade paperback and you&#39;ll be disappointed, but it works as a monthly comic.</p>

<p>Re the original post: too much talk about Morrison doing this or meaning that with the panel placement while almost entirely ignoring Frank Quitely&#39;s input. Even if Morrison dictates the layout of a given page, the artist&#39;s intepretation is key to how it&#39;ll end up looking. <br />

Whatever his point is, he doesn’t particularly care whether or not he communicates it. An illegible image of some scribbles isn’t likely to inspire a movement. It’s akin to a child screaming for attention for attention’s sake, because without legible words the only message Erickson can communicate is that he wants to communicate a message. His incompetence has rendered his point beside itself—because his point is that he is making a point, damn it, and he is making it on the Internet. He actually states his argument over at Red State, but I think he had a better chance garnering sympathy with his non-message: [A critic] wants you to fixate on the new house and ignore the old house. My wife and I bought it for $110,000.00 in March of 2001. It is appraised, for taxes, at $119,000.00. We’re having a tough time selling it. My student loans payments are more each month than the mortgage. But with the new house? It was originally for sale for over $600,000.00 and we benefited from the misery of others in the market downturn. It was tasty misery at that. The man owns two homes—one of which is worth upward of half a million dollars—and clearly enjoys exploiting the market conditions he and his fellow-travelers created. Revels in it. Hence the significance of the non-message he communicates: when he tells people what he truly believes, they’ll understand that Erickson is as odious as the policies he supports. Your average human being tends to be better than the worst consequences of his or her political beliefs. For example, most conservatives champion the free market, but when they meet someone who lost everything when the housing bubble burst, they respond sympathetically because, for them, the consequences of their belief are systemic. They take no personal joy in someone else’s homelessness. Erick Erickson, however, is not an average human being. He’s a spoiled man-child devoted to an ideology so despicable not even he can bring himself to communicate it directly. Yet he feels compelled to because he knows there are other terrible people out there who share the-sentiments-that-shall-not-shared and genuinely seeks their approval. So what does he do? He artfully arranges some books on the desk behind him, takes off his shirt and scribbles his foul screed. He performs the very act (“whining”) he condemns in blissful ignorance of his unintentionally ironic statement. The man can do nothing but whine—and he proves as much by whining an unintelligible criticism of whining. If there’s a market for shirtless men who loudly say nothing, I suppose we ought to thank Erickson for cornering it for us. Somebody had to, and far better him than us.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/10/its-just-a-book-about-indian-history.html"><span><strong>It's just a book about Indian history.</strong> Earlier this week, Salman Rusdie told Haaretz: Everybody loves The Wire and I think it's okay, but in the end it's just a police series. I love The Sopranos. Deadwood, which didn't last long, was a series I liked a lot; it had more filthy language than I've ever heard on television anywhere in my life, but it was brilliantly written. I like some of what is on now, like Breaking Bad and Dexter. Ever since then, his Twitter feed's been mighty entertaining. In particular, he implicitly claims that The Wire is &quot;just a police series&quot; but Entourage is something more. (I'm not sure exactly what that something is, but it must have to do with the fact that, as a celebrity himself, he could relate to the Vince and his crew on a profound level inaccessible to those of us who found the show and its characters vapid and humorless.) Rushdie's dismissal of The Wire as &quot;mere&quot; genre fiction couldn't be more poorly timed, coming as it does on the tail end of Colson Whitehead's dismissal of genre fiction as an operative category in contemporary literature. Genre only matters, Whitehead argues, to people incapable of seeing past it. One would assume that a magic realist like Rushdie would understand that. But no. He'll watch Game of Thrones, but only because it qualifies as research: I watched all that because if I am going to work in this field, I need to know what it is going on. I have been making myself have whole-series marathons to get the point of how it goes. I will soon start writing my little series. What's his &quot;little series&quot; about? It's a sort of paranoid science-fiction series, people disappearing and being replaced by other people. Sounds like just another science fiction series to me.</span></a></div>
