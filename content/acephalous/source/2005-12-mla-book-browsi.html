<p>I needed was more money.&nbsp; The line at the ATM snaked around the former homes of pay phones.&nbsp; I stood there patiently . . . like a toddler with a Big Gulp and an undersized bladder.&nbsp; At that point I ran into fellow UCI future-alum Peter Byrne.&nbsp; He looked sharp.&nbsp; I don't want to knock his typical attire but I had never seen him with clean lines and a complementary trench coat.&nbsp; He took one look at what Sean called my &quot;blog hipster&quot; look and correctly sussed that I was not on the market.&nbsp; We talked for a couple of minutes then he went to search for &quot;his&quot; suite.&nbsp; I haven't seen him since but I can spy the gutter from my window so I'm sure it wasn't a disaster.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I asked her how she knew so much about the books she sold.&nbsp; &nbsp;She informed me that she gets so bored sometimes she has nothing better to do than read the merchandise.&nbsp; If only all students displayed such admirable laziness.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Enough about the books I bought.&nbsp; Because if the wife asks I didn't buy a single book.&nbsp; I don't even know what a book is.&nbsp; But I did eventually find myself before the <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/">Inside Higher Ed</a> booth.&nbsp; I saw two men (neither of whom was Scott McLemee, whom I had met that morning) discussing something and a woman passing out candy.&nbsp; I went for the candy.&nbsp; She asked me if I ever read IHE and I told her of course I do . . . I consider McLemee a friend and look forward to reading his column every week.&nbsp; </p>

<p>She seemed impressed that I knew McLemee's name so she started to stare at my most masculine chest.&nbsp; She parsed my letters and outed me as Office Coitus Interruptus Guy.&nbsp; Scott Jaschik didn't bat an eye and continued talking to some unknown male.&nbsp; I approached him to &quot;quickly&quot; introduce myself and he immediately turned to his companion and said:</p>

<p> &quot;This is Scott Kaufman . . . the guy who caught the kids having sex in his office.&quot;</p>

<p>His interlocutor responded:</p>

<p>&quot;Nice to finally meet you Scott.&nbsp; I'm Matt.&quot;&nbsp; Being that I hadn't slept in 24 hours at that point I took the &quot;finally&quot; to be a colloquialism.&nbsp; Then I looked up and read his full tag:</p><center><p><strong>Matthew Greenfield</strong></p></center><p>For one delirious quarter of a second I nearly blurted out that I blogged alongside a Matt Greenfield but Matt rendered that unnecessary by gently reminding my scrambled eggs that I knew him.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Then shit of unknown origin descended from the sky and landed on Jaschik's jacket.&nbsp; It splattered on his sleeve and he and Matt and I stared at the ceiling in a vain effort to identify the culprit.&nbsp; Fearing for my life I fled the scene of the untimely release and made my way back into the main rooms.&nbsp; Once there I met up with the people I almost consider my cohorts now . . . but I must pause that story until the demons stop darting in and out of my peripheral vision. </p>

<p>UPDATE #1: Scott Jaschik writes:</p>

<p>After you and Matthew left the booth, I went off to clean my jacket. En route, I noticed three hotel workers talking in the area between the exhibit hall annex in which our booth is located and the main area, and I was mulling whether to complain to them about the bird situation and I thought &quot;they'll never believe me, despite the evidence that remains on my jacket.&quot; But just then, not one but two birds flew down and landed&nbsp; so I went up to this trio, pointed to the birds, pointed to my jacket, and suggested that there is a problem with some of those being admitted to the MLA exhibit hall without proper badges. One of the men then told me: &quot;In the country where I come from, having this happen is very good luck, especially right before the new year.&quot;<br /><br />I was not thrilled with this response, I'm afraid, but another of the men found the supervisor, who promptly took my jacket and promised to return to the IHE booth -- dry-cleaned -- before the conference ends.</p>

		<span id="comment-12402086-content"><p>I once tried, not very hard, to get a NYRB rep to give me a free copy of <em>The Anatomy of Melancholy</em>, to no avail.  This was four or five years ago, at an ABA conference, so it wasn&#39;t completely unlikely that they&#39;d be giving free books away; in fact, I think at the previous year&#39;s convention they had given my mother a free copy of <em>A Month in the Country</em> which she then gave to me.</p>

<p>I also didn&#39;t get any free books from the Dalkey Archive, though I did have a very brief conversation with Chad Wossname.</p>

<p>The point of this comment is, did you notice if <em>The Anatomy of Melancholy</em> was among the books displayed?  Because that is a long-ass book.</p></span>

I thought to myself: &quot;What a wonderful opportunity to meet someone I've read daily and corresponded with occasionally the past nine months.&quot; Holbo and I sat down in the front row and with a subtlety born of never having to be especially subtle, looked around to see if Michael was there. Here is the picture of the person I (and I imagine John also) was looking for. Never saw him. After the panel John and I are walking with Williams, McLemee and fellow panelist David Shumway to a resteraunt to continue the post-panel discussion and I mention that I was disappointed I didn't get to meet Michael. Williams looks at me and says &quot;He was sitting right next to you.&quot; My eyes bug out. &quot;Right next to us?&quot; &quot;Sure. He was the guy who asked whether we should let Vincent Leitch back into the room.&quot; (There had been a &quot;disturbance&quot; in the room next door. More on that in the summary of the panel itself.) I think to myself: The guy with the beard and no name tag, who made an incredibly witty remark before letting Leitch back into the room and who Shumway kept pointing to when he praised the work Michael has done on his blog. That was him? For obvious reasons, then, I think I will cease posting updates of individual panels until I sleep for at least four hours in a row. Then it is off to the races. Again.</span></a></div>

I met someone who didn't feel comfortable revealing her online handle to me but she's obviously familiar with my work. I don't think she's lying either, since she introduced herself to me. It also brings up an interesting question: Are some ordinary names actually handles? Is &quot;Adam Kotsko&quot; really Adam Kotsko? Is he actually Tom Smith or Jason Jones? I ask because as I tried to coordinate the conversation I was currently having with ones I've had in comment sections past it occured to me that real-sounding names are neither more nor less likely to be real than obvious pseudonyms. So whoever you are online, Early Afternoon Interlocutor, know that you have blown the stitches of my world. (Not that it didn't need it.)</span></a></div>
