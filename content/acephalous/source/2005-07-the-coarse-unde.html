		<span id="comment-7589002-content"><p>I can only think of a few writers for whom this &quot;exhaustion effect&quot; does not apply - Joyce and Pynchon come to mind, since both of them were very careful about what they published and generally (with some exceptions) avoided writing too much occasional journalism and essays (although there&#39;s a collection of these for Joyce).</p>

<p>It applies to virtually every other writer and strikes you particularly hard when you&#39;re dissertating and have to read everything they&#39;ve ever written.  I just finished doing this with Mary McCarthy, and by the time I had finished the mediocre stuff (like her book-length report on the Watergate scandal - who the hell reads that anymore?) had thoroughly infected the good stuff that got me interested in her in the first place.</p></span>

Can I suggest a better palate-cleansing sorbet after London would be something fruitier from the American 19th century? Thoreau or Whitman? Just little doses, mind you. Then a swallow or two of Poe. </p>

<p>BTW, The Man Without Qualities is perfectly finished, Musil just didn&#39;t realize it. Pretend the second volume never happened and you&#39;ll be fine. :-P</p></span>

I belong. 1. How do you organize your collection? The Littlewomedievalist and I segregate our academic books from our general fiction, history, philosophy, &amp;c. Then our academic books are sorted up on the basis of ownership. As you can see from the first photo on the left, the back bedroom is now a haven for books on medieval literature, philosophy, and history. To your right is the shelf in which all the books at all germane to my dissertation live. Other books squat there too, as you can tell: the works of literary journalism I teach occupy the second shelf. (Not pictured are chess books on the first shelf. No one needs to know how many chess books I've read.) The organizing principle behind this arrangement stresses convenience and pains the parts of my brain which demand order. I tend to use my shelves as a mneumonic, with books rotating alongside the rhythm of my work. So you can tell from the books on the right-hand side of that picture that I'm working on something that involves the popularization of science (The Blank Slate and Collapse), William and Henry James, popular American novels, and debates about the nature of the realism/naturalism distinction. These are the high traffic Americanist books, the ones whose rotations are so regular they're housed immediately beside my desk. Next to the kitchen, an anonymous Ikea bookshelf still bears the scars of my qualifying exams. You can see the generalist quality of this shelf: the theory I needed to work through my Theory list, the classics of American literary criticism, &amp;c. Because it's adjacent to the kitchen, it also suffers the occasional invasion of convenience: I finished Lethem's Fortress of Solitude and needed some crackers, so now it sits beside some Kenneth Burke and (inexplicably) Charles Lyell. (The Lyell shouldn't be there. It misbehaves and will be punished.) The only other features of our collection worth mention are Theoryland and the Science Fiction &amp; Irish Literature ghetto. Theoryland is stacked three rows deep. While I wish this were some clever commentary on &quot;the depth of the books,&quot; it's really a testament to Gigantor--the 8.32 ft. tall solid-cherry monster once home to an ornamental law library but purchased for $80 in a secondhand shop--and his marketing prowess. All the books want to live on Gigantor. The sublime materiality of a 318 lbs. bookshelf in an apartment almost exclusively festooned with particle-board attracts all the best books. They know that social mobility flows both ways. On Monday you're right where you want to be, sandwiched between Derrida and Deleuze, a complete set of Durant's Story of Civilization above your head; on Tuesday you awake dazed in unfamiliar and unfriendly environs, comics and graphic novels to your left, Vintage reprints of Phillip K. Dick novels to your right....</span></a></div>
