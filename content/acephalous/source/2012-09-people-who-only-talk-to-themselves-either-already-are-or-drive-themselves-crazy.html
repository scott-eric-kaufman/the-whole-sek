        <meta name="description" content="After the past week and, well, the past twenty-four hours, I think it's become clear to conservatives that their strategy to install Mitt Romney in the White House has failed. As strategies go, it had its charms: conservatives would only talk and watch and read other conservatives, thereby eliminating the possibility that they might hear or see or read anything that failed to conform to their prejudices. For months, this strategy seemed to be working. They had convinced themselves and each other that Obama, being the worst president in the history of the United States, couldn't be elected again if the opposition candidate had some appeal to the center. So they chose Mitt Romney. Unfortunately, Mitt Romney also chose them. He started to appeal to the conservative base in order to acquire what had already been delivered. He was supposed to bring in the centrists, but he and his campaign chose tactics designed to further secure the base. The irony is that his appeals to the base have only angered and alienated it. His &quot;inelegant&quot; iterations of their cherished theories have set the terms of the national debate against conservatives, such that any argument about equitable taxation must begin by discussing the 47 percent instead of job creation. In the war to frame the debate, conservatives now believe, Mitt Romney has unwittingly played the role of Benedict Arnold. With the former opportunist Romney now considered an extremist, what are the actual extremists to do? If the past week is any indication, they are going to spend the next two months losing their shit to establish their bona fides. Now that they have no reason to appeal to center, or to rational thought generally, we are in for two months of: Barack Obama has been building a cult of personality reminiscent of fascist leaders. That doesn’t mean he’s a fascist; it doesn’t mean that he’s Hitler or Mussolini or Stalin. But his semiotics and iconography are far more suited for a fascist country than a vibrant republic. Of course Ben Shapiro has no clue what &quot;semiotics&quot; actually means, but it makes him sound like an authority on something, in this case the &quot;fascist&quot; field of branding. Instead of being annoyed that, from Shepard Fairey forward, the Obama campaign team has simply demonstrated a more sophisticated understanding of contemporary advertising than any of its Republican opponents, Shapiro wants to claim that the use of &quot;iconography&quot; is &quot;far more suited for a fascist country than a vibrant republic.&quot; And it doesn't matter how many images of the Twin Towers falling or acting Presidents in flight suits you show him, Shapiro will never believe that any other administration has ever used the power of singular images to sway public opinion.

			<p>After the past week and, well, <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/todays-philosophical-inquiry">the past twenty-four hours</a>,
 I think it&#39;s become clear to conservatives that their strategy to 
install Mitt Romney in the White House has failed. As strategies go, it 
had its charms: conservatives would only talk and watch and read other 
conservatives, thereby eliminating the possibility that they might hear 
or see or read anything that failed to conform to their prejudices. For 
months, this strategy seemed to be working. They had convinced 
themselves and each other that Obama, being the worst president in the 
history of the United States, couldn&#39;t be elected again if the 
opposition candidate had some appeal to the center. So they chose Mitt 
Romney.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mitt Romney also chose them. He started to appeal to 
the conservative base in order to acquire what had already been 
delivered. He was supposed to bring in the centrists, but he and his 
campaign chose tactics designed to further secure the base. The irony is
 that his appeals to the base have only angered and alienated it. His 
&quot;inelegant&quot; iterations of their cherished theories have set the terms of
 the national debate against conservatives, such that any argument about
 equitable taxation must begin by discussing the 47 percent instead of 
job creation. In the war to frame the debate, conservatives now believe,
 Mitt Romney has unwittingly played the role of Benedict Arnold.</p>
<p>With the former opportunist Romney now considered an extremist, what 
are the actual extremists to do? If the past week is any indication, 
they are going to spend the next two months losing their shit to 
establish their <em>bona fides</em>. Now that they have no reason to appeal to center, or to rational thought generally, we are in for <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/09/20/Obama-cult-of-personality-iconography-semiotics">two months of</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Barack Obama has been building a cult of personality 
reminiscent of  fascist leaders. That doesn’t mean he’s a fascist; it 
doesn’t mean that  he’s Hitler or Mussolini or Stalin. But his semiotics
 and iconography  are far more suited for a fascist country than a 
vibrant republic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course Ben Shapiro has no clue what &quot;semiotics&quot; actually means, 
but it makes him sound like an authority on something, in this case 
the &quot;fascist&quot; field of branding. Instead of being annoyed that, from 
Shepard Fairey forward, the Obama campaign team has simply demonstrated a
 more sophisticated understanding of contemporary advertising than any 
of its Republican opponents, Shapiro wants to claim that the use of 
&quot;iconography&quot; is &quot;far more suited for a fascist country than a vibrant 
republic.&quot; And it doesn&#39;t matter how many images of the Twin Towers 
falling or acting Presidents in flight suits you show him, Shapiro will 
never believe that any other administration has ever used the power of 
singular images to sway public opinion. It&#39;s only ever been Obama.</p>
<p>This is but the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>The knotted fringes of the far right movement no longer have any 
reason to remain tangled, so as their weak coalitions unravel expect to 
hear more about every inane and insane theory that&#39;s dogged the 
administration since before Inauguration Day 2009. I fully expect the 
next two months will witness some of the most absurd political theater 
ever to grace the American stage, and I fully expect that while some of 
it will make me weep for the state of our great republic, quite a bit of
 it will provide me with an endless hours of entertainment.</p>

As this is to be the first of many posts breaking down the visual rhetoric of Game of Thrones, I want to tell you either &quot;You're welcome!&quot; or &quot;I'm sorry!&quot; I need to write them for my class this quarter so they will written. Regular blogging will continue as usual. (See?) Now on to &quot;Winter Is Coming.&quot; For those of you who haven't read George R.R. Martin's Games of Thrones, it's important to note that there are twenty-four characters through whose perspective the narrative is occasionally focalized, meaning that the writers and directors of the television series needed to go full-Rashomon or find another way to imbue each episode with the feel of perspectival diversity. Which makes the decision to open &quot;Winter Is Coming&quot; with the Prologue odd but instructive. On the one hand, beginning where the novel begins is a simple decision: Martin placed the Prologue where he did because he wanted to set the mood for the scenes to come and director Tim Van Patten followed suit. On the other hand, in an episode that can only be 52 minutes long and in which numerous perspectives must be introduced, devoting 11 minutes to the quick end of the short life of Will, the Prologue's narrator, seems excessive. I'm going to argue otherwise: what the material contained in the Prologue provides the audience is a means of sympathizing with the different perspectives on Will's life and death, and in so doing begins to recreate the structure of the novel. But I'm getting ahead of myself here. First we need to be introduced to Will: He's one of those little black dots on horseback in this extreme long or establishing shot, the purpose of which is establish the scale of the wall by providing us with an identifiable reference and the state of the environment by showing us an unimaginably large wall made of ice and a cover of snow that follows the wall to the vanishing point. Before we even meet Will, then, Van Patten informs us that he is a small man beholden to powers great enough to build and maintain that wall, and that he is likely in peril, because no one who isn't builds and lives behind a wall like that. Moreover, the contrast between the blue-white snow and the black riders suggests that not only is Will in peril, he's conspicuously so, which means he's all the more likely to meet a sad end. And Van Patten's communicated all of this in a single shot. He cuts to another establishing shot that works much like the first: in what we'll call a very long shot, the world is still white and empty of all but some men and trees. This is the classic Russian technique of turning a forest into the cinematic equivalent of a barren desert: the only life visible is either human or snow-coated evergreen. These riders...</span></a></div>

Because as it turns out I somehow missed this: Breitbart News is doubling its reward—to $100,000—for one of the missing pieces of Barack Obama’s past, which may be the key to understanding his collapsing Middle East policy: the “Khalidi tape,” a video kept under wraps by the Los Angeles Times since April 2008. The Khalidi tape shows Obama at a 2003 farewell party for radical Palestinian academic and activist Rashid Khalidi, and reportedly features vitriolic anti-Israel rhetoric ... The ties between Obama and Khalidi are deep, going back to the days when Obama served on the board of the Woods Fund with former terrorist Bill Ayers, and provided funds for Khalidi’s Arab American Action Network ... Given Obama’s muted response to the attacks on U.S. embassies and troops throughout the Middle East today; his refusal to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week; his eagerness to sacrifice Americans’ free speech rights in fruitless gestures of appeasement; and his belated but effusive support for the now-radicalized Arab Spring, it is worth examining the roots of his misguided foreign policy. The Khalidi tape may provide the key. I'm pleased to introduce you to The New New Stupid, son of The New Stupid, inevitable father to the host of Newer Stupids due to arrive in the next two months. When FOX decided to blanket itself in that 1998 video of Obama discussing taxation as an anodyne form of redistributing wealth, all I could think was that someone in management thought tit-for-tat the most effective strategy to counter the release of the Romney video.* If they have videos, I imagined management saying, we will too. Put aside the fact that FOX claims to be an independent news organization and focus on the fact that executives at FOX believe that &quot;video&quot; is a unit, and that the only way to counter one unit of &quot;video&quot; is with another. Breitbart News, so named because it decided to call itself that, literally doubled-down today in an attempt to produce a unit of &quot;video&quot; that will damage Obama's candidacy more than Romney's did his. This video, if it exists, will do maximal damage because it'll introduce Breitbart News readers and FOX viewers to shocking new ideas like &quot;Obama has Muslim sympathies,&quot; &quot;Obama hates Israel&quot; and &quot;Obama pals around with terrorists.&quot; As I noted in my previous post, the problem with this approach is that anyone who's going to believe that already does, so finding a unit of &quot;video&quot; that can be edited to demonstrate Obama's long-standing loathing of America and gefilte fish will have absolutely no impact on the election. Yet it's incredibly important to conservative &quot;news&quot; outlets to find and disseminate as many of these units as they can between now and November. I would say that I don't know why, but I know that sucking at...</span></a></div>
