there may be no place for the likes of those who would own up to their

The only comments left enabled are the rarely used Report to the General commenting system and they apparently are currently only being used by some hit-and-run posters who it is claimed will be banned (of course only to appear under another name).</p>

<p>This is all so sad. I know you need to defend yourself, but you also have to be careful not to go appear as crazed as your attacker clearly is. So far you seem to be doing fine, but no one can win a full war. Doesn&#39;t ever happen. Trust that the recipients will see the craziness too. Let them react before you do. I would hope none would have the power to summarily harm you with allowing you to mount a credible defense. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-72319142-content"><p>Most certainly continue to be the better person -- but don&#39;t close off avenues due to a perception of a dilemma that may be false.  You may have to use that information at some point.  If so, it&#39;s slightly less annoying not to have to go back on saying that you wouldn&#39;t do it.</p>

<p>As for being slandered on blogs that you&#39;ve been banned from, I have considerable personal expertise.  I&#39;d say that if it&#39;s actual slander, like saying that you&#39;re a racist, it&#39;s worth responding to.  If it&#39;s the usual kind of &quot;Joe X is a fool and now we can say so since he can&#39;t say anything&quot;, it&#39;s annoying, but best ignored.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s likely to happen on JG, because the public stance is that the whole subject is over, period.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still hoping that after a couple of days go by, everyone will look back at the more heated aspects of this exchange and wonder what they were thinking.  (Of course, you won&#39;t get to do that and then forget about it -- the official gears will have been put in motion, paperwork generated, etc.)  One comparison to past blog scandals that I haven&#39;t yet seen in the Kos saying didn&#39;t care about the contractor deaths in Iraq one.  Having an online flamewar with someone&#39;s death in it somewhere makes it far worse than normal.</p></span>

By the time you&#39;re done with that, perhaps tempers will have cooled.

		<span id="comment-72348652-content"><p>Hi.  I&#39;m coming your way by a link from somewhere else and I&#39;ve caught up on your current situation and I just want to say that as a person who has been stalked and harassed online myself, I think the people who are encouraging you not to respond to these people anymore are correct.  It took me a very long time to come to that place of understanding when others advised me to ignore them myself, however, what I learned was that people who do this sort of thing CANNOT be reasoned with.  So you sit on your end and you think to yourself---well, if I just present a rational telling of everything that went down, he/she will see that he/she is being unreasonable/wrong/stalkerish/whatever, but that NEVER happens because the person doing the harassing will never look at the situation from your point of view and will never admit to being wrong.  NEVER.  </p>

<p>It took me almost a year of wasting my life trying to fight my stalkers to realize how futile my efforts were.  The lengths they were willing to go to harm me were insane (hunting down my children from information I had given out in my own blog--posting my home address and phone number to name a few).  They did not consider going after my CHILDREN as wrong.  They told me it was my fault that I had ever mentioned my children.  This is the mentality of the mentally unstable stalker/harasser.  They have nothing to lose and they go where they know you will be harmed the most and they simply DO NOT CARE.</p>

<p>I decided to NEVER again refer to them or respond to them in my blog.  Since that point, they&#39;ve pretty much left me alone although once in a while one of them will post something to try to get under my skin and I pretend I haven&#39;t seen it.  I have everything copied that they have done and keep it in a file, but I refuse to give them anymore attention.  They love the attention and feel like they hold some sort of power over you when you respond--and they do what this JG person is doing by trying to make it appear as though YOU are the one initiating things when you are a VICTIM.</p>

<p>So I would suggest keeping all evidence and refusing to give them more airtime because believe you me, they are loving this.</p></span>

This idiot should keep in mind that this can come back to bite him--if say, you were fired or disciplined, and took it to legal, he could very well be subpoenaed. (Hell, with the level of harassment he&#39;s subjecting you to, he should really hope and pray you don&#39;t take it to the law.) And how would he explain this activity to his boss? How would he explain this activity to his friends?</p>

<p>As for JG, well--it seems the greatest offenses committed have been some of us bitches calling his actions sexist (apologize! NOW! damn you, harpies!), and letting him know that one of his commenters is a stalker freak.  JG&#39;s enabling of this is disgusting, but not surprising.  It would be one thing if you were trolling his blog--I could understand his reluctance then--but you aren&#39;t.    </p></span>

<p>We who pay attention to your posts know you&#39;re not some kind of insane racist nutjob.  Let the stalker&#39;s energy run its course.  I guarantee you he/she won&#39;t be watching your blog in two weeks. - TL</p></span>

<p>How does that work? Ignoring is enabling. If you don&#39;t find the whole &quot;Sir, Reporting to the General Sir&quot; meme disturbing then you need some help.</p>

<p>Ignoring Jesus General is a mistake. I hope Wired Magazine writes up this issue. Not even the Daily KOS goes as far as the General and his &quot;troops&quot;. I find bigotry, misogyny, blackmail, and coercion offensive no matter who does it.</p>

All I know is that I am being harassed by someone named &quot;John Casper.&quot; My attempts to discover his identity have been limited to determining whether he is the same &quot;John Casper&quot; who posts on FireDogLake. I have made these attempts because, should it come to that, I do not want to accuse the wrong person of harassment. What do I mean by harassment? Since he sent the first email to the UCI community, he has sent five more. The second concerned my apparent disregard for UCI disciplinary policy, and included material from a private email I had sent &quot;General JC Christian, Patriot,&quot; which the General shared with &quot;John Casper.&quot; I wrote: He's decided to contact my employer because of some civil debate on the Gilbert thread. I'm not likely to get in trouble for this, but it will annoy people (myself included), through the creation of unnecessary meetings/conference calls/&amp;c. As he's your commenter, his actions will reflect on you, so I thought I'd give you the heads up. To &quot;John Casper,&quot; the act of wanting to avoid entangling my university in an online disagreement constitutes my &quot;assessment of UCI's disciplinary policy.&quot; When I informed him that I had written this: Although it will cause me personal inconvenience, I do hope the people who received this email take it seriously. Accusations of hate-speech and race-based discrimination should be investigated, so that when the complaints are legitimate they can be dealt with accordingly. He then forward that to half the UCI community. By this point, I had sent him three emails. He has responded to none. Now he believes I have committed a crime against him. He learned of my desire to discover his identity from the General. Here is my email (to which the General never responded): Would it be possible to get the IP information for the Ghost of Adolph Rupp? He's stepped up his behavior and is now bordering on harassment. I have his name, but I need to know which &quot;John Casper&quot; he is. When &quot;John Casper&quot; asked whether the General would share that information, the General responded: not going to do it. stay off the comments for awhile so i can say there's no way to find your ip. I'm considering revoking my opinion of the General. I no longer think he's a classy guy. So at this point I still do not know the identity of the man who is threatening my career. Moreover, he is conspiring with others to hide his identity from me. You can read the complete text of his letter below the fold. As to why I am publishing this information, the first reason is because I have absolutely nothing to hide. The second is that he is copying his emails to news outlets, and in so doing indicates that he wants people to read them. (He includes the General's email in an attachment, and I...</span></a></div>

Now I'm back to work.) All scribes utilize lexicons. Roget's regnant tome monopolizes the matriculant market. Neophytes congregate in monograph outlets to procure a reprint. They disembark at their domicile and allocate Peter Roget's linguistical treatise a bearing on a transversal above their desktop computer. There it hunkers until a pedagogue implores them to formulate a polemic. Then the prentice wordsmith extracts it. The pupil employs it to ameliorate his pedestrian prose. With hubris he asseverates the eminence of his phraseological aptitude: &quot;My profiency with palaver is unparalleled. Scrutinize my incomparable prose if you don't accredit me!&quot; The ensuing evening his educator ensconces himself at his trestle to assess his august pupil's critique. After he appraises it he thrusts his extremities on his coutenance. He again cognizes that graduands should not be sanctioned to retain Roget's opus because proprietorship of aforementioned reprehensible receptacle of lexical surrogates elicits maximal keening from all preceptors. &quot;Why!&quot; the mentor declaims at his articulatory apex. &quot;Why must charges importune their prose with exorbitant diction?&quot;</span></a></div>
