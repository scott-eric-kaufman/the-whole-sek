		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01348062196a970c-content"><p>Scott, are you rejecting Praeger’s claim that it’s desirable (or, perhaps, possible) to argue from first principles?</p>

<p>Everything else equal, if the absence of one race or ethnic group from one side of political debate is suspect, and invalidates the claims of the political position from which they’re absent, then it seems that the overwhelming presence of a race or ethnic group from the other side is suspect as well.  That is, unless you wish to claim that the interests of some groups are more valid than the interests of others.</p>

<p>Which raises the question, is everything else equal?  Your premise is that the Tea Party movement represents a particular “white” interest.  Praeger’s claim is that the Tea Party movement does in fact represent the self-interest of all Americans, but that African Americans do not recognize this fact.  Neither of these claims is self-evident.  Your caricature of Praeger as evil or stupid is not persuasive.  You should note what Hamilton writes in The Federalist Papers #1:</p>

<blockquote>I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because their situations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or ambitious views. Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men may be actuated by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted that much of the opposition which has made its appearance, or may hereafter make its appearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if not respectable--the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived jealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes which serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we, upon many occasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right side of questions of the first magnitude to society. This circumstance, if duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any controversy. And a further reason for caution, in this respect, might be drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that those who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists. Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition, and many other motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate as well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a question. Were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all times, characterized political parties. For in politics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword. Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.</blockquote>

<p>From survey research, we know a few things (and I should admit that this is a bit off my patch and that, as a science, this part of Political Science is progressive, so there may be a study or survey which modifies, contradicts, or invalidates the surveys I’ve read).  First, whites and blacks in America disagree about the prevalence, effect, and nature of racism.  Second, inequality of outcome is explained in cultural terms by whites (“destruction of the black family”) and by reference to racism by African-Americans.  The salience of racism as a factor that determines the public opinion of these groups is, as a result, markedly different.  We also know that racial identity is a less salient identifying factor for whites then blacks.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, I’ve heard Eugene Robinson make a point similar to Praeger’s.  Once racism and affirmative action are taken off the table, what does the Democratic Party have to offer the growing African American middle class?</p>

<p>Praeger made no claim regarding the “inherent” abilities of any group, either directly or implicitly.  And, as the survey research demonstrates, you can explain the same set of facts without reference to the “inherent” abilities of any particular group.  It’s dishonest for you to imply otherwise.</p></span>

Their argument, briefly, is that focusing on B.D.'s gradual acceptance that he had suffered Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder transforms him into an object of sympathy for both the American right and left; and that, as such, PTSD represents a political common ground that is, to the rest of the world, rather unsavory. For example, if an American soldier kills civilians in Iraq, from the American perspective, that soldier suffers a trauma; whereas from the international perspective, that soldier may have committed a war crime, etc. It was an impressive argument, but it didn't sit well with me because it relied too heavily on the notion that, unlike Vietnam, the United States military is a volunteer force. It ignores both the extent to which stop-loss has been used to plug recruitment shortfalls and the class politics at play in all military recruitment. If you want to claim that the United States military is used to achieve imperialists ends, there's an argument to be made there; but if you want to claim that United States soldiers knowingly support an imperialist agenda, you have your work cut out for you. All of which is only to say, it seemed odd that these sharp British scholars were taking Gary Trudeau behind the woodshed for being implicitly conservative when there are so many explicitly conservative cartoonists who better express the ideological incoherence of the foreign policy and cultural politics of the contemporary right. Granted, they might not consider actual conservative cartoonists worthy of their attention, and I can see why. Consider Chris Muir, a.k.a. the man who unwittingly proves that white male Tea Party aficionados only listen to arguments proffered by scantily clad women. The only interesting thing about Muir is how bereft of his ideas his &quot;strips&quot; are: he finds the conservative talking point of the day, imagines a domestic scene in which his female characters would be fully or partially nude, and combines them into a poorly drawn political burlesque. How formulaic is he? He could continue his strip indefinitely without ever needing to &quot;draw&quot; again in his life. To demonstrate the validity of this claim, I've done Muir the favor of remixing some of his recent output into entirely new comics: They do, I admit, border on the absurd, but I'd consider that an improvement. I suppose I understand then why Sabin and Barker decided to treat the implicit conservatism in Trudeau then: they probably had a difficult time believing that folks like Muir realistically represent conservative thought in American politics. Would that they were correct.</span></a></div>

His dismissal of such readers almost reaches the point of fetish, as if he thrills at the thought of being the comic auteur who produces books that don't belong on the same shelves as Marvel or DC titles. So strong, in fact, is his desire to not be numbered among the lowly readers of genre titles that despite banking his career on sympathetic portrayals of losers and misfits, he lumps anyone who's ever picked up a copy of Detective Comics and enjoyed it in with the Dan Pussey's of the world. Which is only to say that in Clowes hierarchy of worth, there are reasonably well-adjusted people, self-conscious consumers of indie comic art, losers, pariahs, and loser pariahs who read mainstream comics. The fate of the aforementioned Pussey is, you recall, to have his &quot;silly books&quot; ransacked and mocked by elderly iterations of Ghost World's Enid and Rebecca. How powerful is his desire to distance himself from mainstream titles? His new book, Wilson, contains exactly one reference to comic books period, and it serves to demonstrate that while his titular character may be a felonious asshole whose misogyny dresses the windows of a much more malicious psychosis, at least he knows what's what: Heaven forefend anyone mistake Clowes for one of those readers.* *That said, my annoyance here is at the gesture more than the gesturer. Clowes is a phenomenal talent, but just as I can't brook people who claim they can't dig Pavement because they're into Television or the Wire, people who argue that their taste was never sullied by the commonplace strike a populist nerve. That comparison only makes sense if you know people with an unhealthy fetish for '70s new wave who hate the modern.</span></a></div>
