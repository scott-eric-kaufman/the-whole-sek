        <meta name="description" content="I keep on reading that the title of this season's penultimate Mad Men episode, &quot;The Quality of Mercy,&quot; is &quot;a phrase from Shakespeare&quot; without any explanation as to what its significance might be.

It only exists as a rhetorical tactic. But it doesn't work quite that way anymore. For contemporary audiences the quality of mercy is something granted through extra-textual means -- the play's antisemitism retroactively grants it to Shylock -- which is another way of saying that characters exist in history and shouldn't be judged by their actions in the moment so much as their reputation over the not-so-longue durée. This excuses nothing: Shylock behaves like a stock Jew because Shakespeare didn't think his character worth elevating. The same can't be said of Don Draper in a season in which his status as an unknown quantity's been highlighted by the presence of fellow professional liar Bob Benson. Or can it? The last two episodes have seen him turn against his wife (Megan) and his protege (Peggy) for reasons that aren't entirely clear but clearly aren't merciful.

That's correct: we're Shylock demanding a pound of Draper's flesh and we're the contemporary audience extending him mercy because we know that Shylock's been misunderstood by history.

			<p>I keep on reading that the title of this season&#39;s penultimate <em>Mad Men </em>episode, &quot;The Quality of Mercy,&quot; is &quot;<a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bastard-machine/mad-men-ready-evolve-569970">a phrase from Shakespeare</a>&quot; without any explanation as to what its significance might be. <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-quality-of-mercy,98638/">Todd&#39;s the exception</a>,
 but his account of the play muddies his most pressing insight: one only
 appeals to the quality of mercy when dealing with people who don&#39;t 
deserve it <em>because one wants it from that very same person</em>. It only exists as a rhetorical tactic. But
 it doesn&#39;t work quite that way anymore. For contemporary audiences the

the not-so-<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longue_dur%C3%A9e">longue durée</a>. </em>This excuses nothing:</p>
<p>Shylock behaves like a stock Jew because Shakespeare didn&#39;t think his
 character worth elevating. The same can&#39;t be said of Don Draper in a 
season in which his status as an unknown quantity&#39;s been highlighted by 
the presence of fellow professional liar Bob Benson. Or can it? The last
 two episodes have seen him turn against his wife (Megan) and his 
protege (Peggy) for reasons that aren&#39;t entirely clear but clearly 
aren&#39;t merciful. And yet the arrival of Benson mingles with his failing 
marriage and office foibles in a manner that makes him seem deserving of
 the mercy Shylock wanted to refuse Antonio. That mercy would&#39;ve denied 
Shylock his &quot;pound of flesh.&quot; Care to guess who we are in this analogy?</p>
<p>That&#39;s correct: we&#39;re Shylock demanding a pound of Draper&#39;s flesh<em> and </em>we&#39;re
 the contemporary audience extending him mercy because we know that 
Shylock&#39;s been misunderstood by history. Which is about where we stand 
at this point in the series: Draper&#39;s a tragic figure made all the more 
tragic by the decisions he&#39;s making. He&#39;s an unforgivable human being 
widely recognized as a product of his circumstances. He&#39;s the man 
everyone envies until they see his substance is little more than 
strategically placed shadows -- particularly in this episode. But before
 I comment on that I should note how this episode begins:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00001.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00001.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - the quality of mercy00001" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>With Draper in the fetal position. I&#39;m not going to go all Freudian on you because <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/on_the_power_of.html">I don&#39;t do that anymore</a>.
 What&#39;s more significant than any Freudian overtones is that this is the
 first time in this episode that one side of Draper&#39;s face is hidden 
from the camera. That Phil Abraham went with an overhead shot in order 
to accomplish that is a telling oddity: we don&#39;t normally see shots from
 this perspective outside of the opening credits. Make of that what you 
will. What I find significant is that the opening shot of the episode 1)
 informs us that Don&#39;s wounded and 2) suggests that he&#39;s hiding his 
wound by hiding his face. I know this isn&#39;t actually true -- you can&#39;t 
hide psychological scars behind turned heads or well-positioned shadows 
-- but consider how the rest of the episode is shot. Here&#39;s Don pouring 
orange juice:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00003.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00003.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - the quality of mercy00003" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Abraham&#39;s clearly taking advantage of the &quot;natural&quot; light streaming 
in the set&#39;s windows -- it&#39;s most likely a key light -- but it&#39;s all 
coming from frame-right.&#0160; If you imagine Jon Hamm&#39;s standing in the 
center of a clock facing 12 o&#39;clock, it appears as if there&#39;s a key 
light with a diffuser of some sort around 9 o&#39;clock. If there weren&#39;t a 
diffuser of some sort the contrast would be harsher and it would look 
more noir -- but the shot&#39;s not that flat, as we can see light gently 
reflecting off the cupboards behind him. What&#39;s missing is some sort of 
fill light at 2 o&#39;clock to illuminate Hamm&#39;s face. Why&#39;s it missing? 
Because Abraham wanted him to look &quot;shady&quot; without seeming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaeism#Figurative_use">Manichean</a>. That&#39;s why the diffuser&#39;s significant: it prevents the contrast from being harsh and turning Draper into <a href="http://icandi-art.deviantart.com/art/Film-Noir-The-Mobster-158987548">an anti-heroic image of stock-noir</a>.
 The conflict in most noir films being, of course, that Humphrey 
Bogart&#39;s trying to apply his black-and-white code of right and wrong to a
 grey world. Draper&#39;s conflict, of course, is that he has no code to 
apply to an increasingly colorful world, so it stands to reason that 
Abraham wouldn&#39;t shoot him so harshly. Especially when he&#39;s pouring 
orange juice. But what about when he&#39;s pouring vodka <em>into </em>the orange juice?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00006.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00006.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - the quality of mercy00006" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Nope. That&#39;s the same key light. Hamm&#39;s just turned around so now the
 other side of his face is shaded. Not completely, though, because as 
noted there&#39;s some light reflecting off the cupboards that&#39;s preventing 
the entirety of the left side of his face from being in darkness. 
There&#39;s clearly something wrong with him in these shots: it&#39;s not that 
Draper&#39;s drinking in the morning, but that he&#39;s <em>hiding </em>drinking
 in the morning. Even the functional alcoholic occasionally needs a day 
off to drink inappropriately -- not that I speak from experience. But 
that&#39;s clearly what&#39;s happening here: more of the same only slightly 
different. But it doesn&#39;t get any better as the scene progresses:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00011.png"><img alt="" height="281" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00011.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - the quality of mercy00011" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>As soon as he turns around he may as well not have: he&#39;s not bathed 
in the radiance of the same missing fill light. Maybe it&#39;ll improve once
 he stops celebrating Screwdriver Appreciation Day and shows up for 
work?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00025.png"><img alt="" height="278" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00025.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - the quality of mercy00025" width="496" /></a></p>
<p>It&#39;s dogging him. I know shadows can&#39;t actually dog people and that it&#39;s all about strategically placed lights <em>but if I didn&#39;t know any better </em>I&#39;d
 say this shadow was dogging him. Because rhetorically it is. In terms 
of its effect on the audience this shadow has been plastered to a side 
of his face since the moment he woke up<em> in the fetal position</em> 
trying to hide it from the camera in that overhead shot. It dissipates 
some in the meeting in which he &quot;saves&quot; Peggy by attributing her idea to
 the dear and recently departed:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00042.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00042.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - the quality of mercy00042" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It&#39;s not nearly so extreme here, which makes sense, because Draper&#39;s 
in his element. If the producers are manifesting his demons as shadows, 
it&#39;s understandable that they&#39;d be less prominent in the one place 
Draper still feels somewhat comfortable. But the lighting&#39;s still 
working against Hamm: there&#39;s a fill light illuminating most of him, but
 it seems more designed to highlight the drawings of Peggy&#39;s <em>Rosemary&#39;s Baby</em>-inspired children&#39;s aspirin ad. He&#39;s catching the light <em>incidentally</em>
 and Draper&#39;s not a character often filmed in reflected glory. But here 
he is. I don&#39;t have any inside knowledge about why he keeps his head 
canted throughout this scene, but I can say that the effect echoes the 
shadowing from earlier in the episode. He&#39;s fighting the lights to spite
 his face here, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s unintentional. Especially not 
considering his conversation after the meeting:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00049.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00049.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - the quality of mercy00049" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>And this one&#39;s the give-away. This shot shouts the director&#39;s intent 
loud as subtitles: he&#39;s determined to create shadows on Hamm&#39;s face <em>even if it requires off-lighting it very brightly</em>.
 That glare on the right side of his head is the unfortunate side-effect
 of burying the rest of his face beneath shadow in what is, otherwise, a
 very bright room. I&#39;m not sure what the thematic function of this 
shadow is -- I&#39;m wary of explanations of characters that rely too 
heavily on how they&#39;re being presented by individual directors -- but 
there has to be one. I mean:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00051.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00051.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - the quality of mercy00051" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>There has to be one. It&#39;s extremely difficult to create that sort of 
contrast -- diffused or otherwise -- in such well-lit spaces. I&#39;d praise
 the dedicated crew responsible for creating this effect if I knew what 
their names were, because they deserve praise for creating this 
impression of a Don dogged by something. I could be glib and say it&#39;s 
history generally, or his personal history, or his night with Betty, or 
his non-nights with Megan, but I&#39;d rather let the show tell me which of 
those is bothering him. Apparently it&#39;s the latter:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00053.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00053.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - the quality of mercy00053" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Whatever his problem is, the visual structure of the episode is 
relating it back to Megan. He ends this episode as he began it: in the 
fetal position sleeping with Megan&#39;s significant absence.</p>

From here continue to: The second of the so-called “Game of LASER TAG: ‘Then you’ll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock,’” concerns the gratifying results created by the tapestry of eyelines MacClaren established early in the episode. Then we moved on to “The Rains of Castamere” podcast, in which Steven and I disagreed about when the titular song begins. Then, in my first post on the subject, I noted that the eyelines — lasers or no lasers — align in a manner that should (and does) cause suspicion among the guests, foremost among them Catelyn Stark. I almost discuss when the song begins, but then I don’t. I covered that in my final post on “The Rains of Castamere,” in which I defined all the minor elements of Aristotelian tragedy before demonstrating the order and manner in which they cause the maximum amount of pain and keening. I hope this is less confusing. I know when material’s cross-linked and back-dated and newer posts appear before older ones that I sometimes find myself befuddled. There’s no shame in that. Or if there is, take heart in knowing I share it.</span></a></div>

But produced it has been! Enjoy! You can listen to the above podcast here. Our very civilized discussion of the premiere (S03E01). Fancy-talking about “Dark Wings, Dark Words” (S03E02). Here we are blathering on about “Walk of Punishment” (S03E03). Don’t watch — because you can’t — us discuss “And Now His Watch Has Ended” (S03E04). The rudely interrupted first half of our discussion of “Kissed by Fire” (S03E05). The second half of our discussion of religion in “Kissed by Fire” (S03E05). In which we discuss “The Climb” sans spoilers (S03E06). “The Climb” with spoilers (S03E06). “Second Sons.” We has them (S03E08). Belatedly, “The Bear and the Maiden Fair” (S03E07). You're all invited to an epic performance of &quot;The Rains of Castamere&quot; (S03E09).</span></a></div>
