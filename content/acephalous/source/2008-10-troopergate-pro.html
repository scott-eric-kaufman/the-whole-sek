on yesterday’s Michalski ruling, know that I do so reluctantly. At
issue is the so-called “Troopergate” filing, in which six Alaskan
senators sought to quash the legislature’s investigation into possible
abuses of power by Governor Sarah Palin. Here’s Michalski’s summary of
the events to date. The Plantiffs’ argue</p>
<blockquote><p>that the court must immediately enjoin the legislative
investigation because “[a]s the nation watches, Senator French [D],
Senator Elton [D] and Mr. Branchflower [are making] the Alaska
Legislature and the State of Alaska a laughingstock.”</p></blockquote>
<p>On this point, and this point alone, Michalski agrees:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this politically charged atmosphere, perceptions
differ. Consider: Alaska’s Governor pledges her full cooperation with
the investigation, then reverses court when selected for national
office. The Governor files an ethics complaint against herself, then
moves to dismiss it as meritless. The announcement that a witness will
disobey an Alaska legislative subpoena comes from a spokesman of the
McCain Campaign. Six Alaska legislators file suit, asking the court to
rule that the Legislature—their own coequal branch—has no authority to
investigate abuses of power by the Executive. The Attorney General, the
highest law enforcement officer in the state, advises witness that
whether to comply with subpoenas is a matter of personal choice.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs may truly believe that Alaska has become a
“laughingstock,” but they should look at someone other than Defendants
here for the source of the humor.</p></blockquote>
		</div>
					<a id="more"></a>
			<div class="entry-more">
				<p>Michalski then addresses the case-law behind the Plaintiffs’ argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>Plaintiffs give relatively short shrift to the legal
bases for the relief they ask for, and with good reason. In support of
their extraordinary request—that the court shut down a duly authorized
legislative investigation in the final weeks of its life, solely to
forestall a possibly negative impact on the fortunes of one political
party, Plaintiffs are able to cite . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Read <a href="http://media.adn.com/smedia/2008/10/02/10/trooper.source.prod_affiliate.7.pdf">the decision itself</a> for the legal niceties.&nbsp; I’ll focus on the rhetorical effect:</p>
<blockquote><p>. . . Plaintiffs are able to cite:</p>
<p>—not a single case from any jurisdiction . . . </p>
<p>—not a single case from any jurisdiction . . . </p>
<p>—not a single case from any jurisdiction . . . </p>
<p>—not a single case from any jurisdiction . . . </p>
<p>—not a single case from any jurisdiction . . . </p>
<p>—not a single case from any jurisdiction . . . </p>
<p>—not a single case from any jurisdiction . . . </p>
<p>—not a single case from any jurisdiction . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Michalski’s conclusion?</p>
<blockquote><p>Alaska law is unambiguous on these issues, and
Plaintiffs failure to cite it, while lamentable, is understandable as
well . . . . </p>
<p>[Plaintiffs'] obviously half-hearted argument cites no case law and relies on no legal principles . . . . </p>
<p>Again, if there were a single case in America that supports any of
these highly dubious propositions, Plaintiffs would presumably have
brought it to the court’s attention . . . . </p>
<p>Rarely, if ever, has a request for such extraordinary injunctive relief been made on such flimsy legal grounds.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s difficult to tell whether Michalski believes the legislators
are ignorant of the law or merely partisan hacks. At times, he seems to
believe the former and sounds like a high school Civics teacher: “In
the tripartite form of government shared to some degree by every one of
the U.S. states,” &amp;c. This condescension could be a rhetorical ploy
on his part, but Michalski sometimes seems convinced that the
legislators have a Palin-esque understanding of the separation of
powers, as when they</p>
<blockquote><p>confuse two very different concepts: the actual <em>exercise</em> of executive power (which of course is for the Executive), and the power to <em>investigate</em>
the Executive’s exercise of executive power (which is a fundamental
power—and duty—of the Legislature . . . . Since all executive powers
are given by law to the Executive, and since every action by the
Executive is presumably taken pursuant to its executive powers, the
Alaska Legislature—according to Plaintiffs—is forbidden from
investigating <em>any executive action at all</em>. For six sitting
legislators to come into court and seek thus to eliminate one of the
Legislature’s most fundamental and historically important powers—and
all, apparently, for the prospect of short-term political gain in one
national election—is stunningly short-sighted.</p></blockquote>
<p>What we have here, then, is an example of legislators willing to
cede powers inherent to it at the behest of an executive branch which
believes all powers—every last one of them—are proper to the office of
the Executive. Now, I don’t know about you, but isn’t it ironic that
conservatives are complaining that Palin isn’t Bush, and that Biden’s
repeated attempts to smear her by association are unwarranted <em>the day after Michalski’s decision appears</em>?</p>

What does that have to do with anything?  Let me offer a small chart.  Let&#39;s say that a conservative like KC Johnson who is known for any or all of deception, shading the truth, ideological fixation or outright lying writes a defense of normal Americana -- it doesn&#39;t matter what.  That the executive is not a dictator, say.  What should your response be?</p>

<p>Year + 1:  Wow!  This person is an intellectually honest, respectable conservative!  Let&#39;s link this everywhere!<br />
Year + 2: It&#39;s so refreshing to hear a conservative saying these things.  I thought that everyone had forgot.<br />
Year + 3: Well, even a few honest conservatives are seeing the truth, now, about what&#39;s going on.<br />
Year + 4: Finally!  It&#39;s taken a long time, but ordinary conservatives are starting to get this.<br />
Year + 5: All right, things are getting so bad that even the lamest cons are getting it now.<br />
Year + 6: Now they&#39;re saying this?  After flacking for so long?  Well, I suppose that rats get to leave a sinking ship.<br />
Year + 7: Any sane person has to say this now.  They get absolutely no credit for waiting till the last minute.<br />
Year + 8: Damned phonies.  The Bush era is going down, so they&#39;re trying to save their credibility.  Screw them.</p>

<p>This is year + 8.  Just link to the Michalski decision directly.</p></span>

And we will do what is best for the American people in tapping into that position and ushering in an agenda that is supportive and cooperative with the president's agenda in that position. Yeah, so I do agree with him that we have a lot of flexibility in there, and we'll do what we have to do to administer very appropriately the plans that are needed for this nation. I admit: unedited transcripts make everyone sound like an idiot. However, so does sounding like an idiot. I'm with Burke and Bérubé on this one: she sounded like a student bluffing her way through an exam she crammed for three hours earlier. At times she was passable --- but only barely. She tacked back to her charted course five seconds into every answer, irrespective of the question, because she could only fit so much on those notecards the cameras didn't once catch her repeatedly shuffling through --- did I just call them notecards? I meant cheat sheets. Please, America, I beg of you: be as smart as the squiggly lines CNN had representing your core convictions are accurate. Live up to the ideals embodied by those squiggly lines our Founding Fathers.</span></a></div>

Obama’s “palling around with terrorists,” yes he is: Because a real American would’ve planted his platform right smack in front of the Liberty Bell, yes he would. This isn’t to say I’m still waiting for the folks who attack Obama for his connection to Ayers to acknowledge that the man who financed the Annenberg Challenge—a.k.a. Annenberg—was a close, personal friend of Ronald Reagan. Because they won’t, you know. Wouldn’t suit “the narrative.” The fact that it’s Annenberg who gave Ayers the $50M these folks claim is proof of Obama’s ideological kinship with the Weather Underground is irrelevant, because, well, because. Reagan was a patriot. Played “Born in the U.S.A.” at every—I mean, it’s not like that guitar-totin’ fellow in the picture knows jack about Philadelphia— —Obama is a terrorist, alright? Just vote for McCain already and I’ll shut up. Ain’t that motivation enough?</span></a></div>
