			<p>Below the fold you’ll find a copy of the paper I presented today.&nbsp; As I’ve <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/01/painstakingly_c.html">said before</a>, when I write a talk, <em>I write a talk</em>.
I don’t write an essay that just so happens to be read aloud. I revise
based on what I hear when I read aloud, so as to avoid speaking
sentences that can’t be parsed on the fly like, say, this one:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tina told Mark that John thought Pauline knew what Sam
had planned for Justine, but Pauline insisted she had no idea John
believed that, nor whether the look Justine exchanged with Mark at work
yesterday meant that Tina had inadvertently revealed Sam’s trap before
John and his brother Adam could spring it.</p></blockquote>
<p>My shorthand’s pretty straight-forward: ALL CAPS means emphasis, en
dash short pause, em dash longer pause, &amp;c.&nbsp; Some of the sentences
are, yes, ungrammatical when written down—but when read aloud, they
make more sense.&nbsp; (There are complicated linguistic reasons for this <em>vis-a-vis </em>the relation of written language to spoken, and one day I might get into them, but that day ain’t today.)&nbsp; That said, my talk:</p><blockquote><p>I’ve taken the title of this panel–”Blogging and the Academy”–a
little literally, but I’ve heard and delivered a number of talks about
the role of blogging in the academy–about its intellectual utility and
its community-building potential–but haven’t heard much discussion
about what impact, if any, the public presence of academics has had on
the general level of online discourse. With that in mind, here are the
two types of academic bloggers I won’t be discussing here today: the
first is best embodied by former UCI economist Duncan Black, a.k.a.
Atrios, whose blog <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/">Eschaton</a>
is, by any of the various unreliable measures of online
popularity—links, hits, page views, &amp;c.—one of the most powerful
voices out there; the second comes in the form of Thers, the
pseudonymous proprieter of <a href="http://whiskeyfire.typepad.com/">Whiskey Fire</a> and an English professor at a small liberal arts college.</p>
<p>Duncan Black I’m avoiding because at this point, Eschaton is little
more than a link-aggregator, with his longest recent post logging in at
a robust 94 words; Thers I’m avoiding because he deliberately lives up
to his namesake, Thersites, and as such is blunt, surly, and coarse;
the verbal equivalent of Homer’s powerfully ugly hunchback whose
satirical mode is, as Laurence Sterne noted, “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rXYLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA254&amp;dq=%22There+is+a+pelting+kind+of+Thersitical+satire,+as+black+as+the+very+ink+%27tis+wrote+with%22&amp;ei=EdL_SJfOI43gswPi_42yAw">of a pelting kind . . . as black as the very ink ’tis wrote with</a>.”&nbsp; Which is only to say, he responds to people like Jonah Goldberg with deserved venom.</p>
<p>If you don’t know who <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah_Goldberg">Jonah Goldberg</a>
is, consider yourself lucky—or formerly lucky, as I’m about to
introduce you to him. He’s the son of conservative icon Lucianne
Goldberg, who first made her mark on the national consciousness spying
on the McGovern campaign for Nixon, but who is now best known for
having advised Linda Tripp to record her conversations with Monica
Lewinsky and deliver the tapes to Ken Starr. Writing in defense of his
mother for publications beholden to her, Jonah Goldberg landed a
twice-weekly column in the National Review and a place of prominence at
two of the most influential conservative sites on the internet:
Townhall and the National Review’s in-house blog, The Corner. His
meretricious—sorry, MERITORIOUS rise to the status of “respectable
pundit”—he’s done the Sunday-morning circuit, and regularly appears on
Glenn Beck and Neil Cavuto’s fair-and-balanced programs as an expert
on, um . . . well, he appears as an expert, professing, with the
over-eagerness of an earnest seeker or arrogant neophyte, professing
academic expertise in matters of American and intellectual history.</p>
<p>Now, if he’s an earnest seeker–if, that is, he’s someone outside the
professorial ranks with an abiding interest in American and
intellectual history, he should be the sort of person people like me
try to engage. By “people like me,” I simply mean “people who don’t,
like Duncan Black, limit themselves to short bursts of quotidian fact;
and don’t, like Thers, pelt ideological opponents with insults as black
as Laurence Sterne’s ink; but simply people who try to share something
of the academic ethos, the academic habit of mind, with the general
public.” Despite my introduction, Goldberg COULD be an enthusiast. In
fact, just this week, a grad student here at Irvine, Brandon Gordon,
wrote him an email, which Goldberg immediately posted online–no breach
of etiquette there–and indicated he appreciated its “civil, if
scolding, tone.”</p>
<p>But he didn’t buy any of the argument. Not that he addressed its
substance, mind you. Quote: “[W]e can debate economic philosophy
another time,” he wrote. Gordon’s analysis “falls apart . . . in his
political analysis,” he wrote. Then he blandished a few Republican
talking points—ACORN! Jesse Jackson! Hollywood!–for a couple of
sentences. As I think should be obvious, Goldberg wasn’t interested in
engaging Gordon intellectually; nor, from the looks of it, was he
interested in seriously engaging him at all.</p>
<p>And yet, the next day, Brandon received an email notification:
“Jonah Goldberg added you as a friend on Facebook. We need to confirm
that you know Jonah in order for you to be friends.”</p>
<p>Needless to say, Goldberg’s offer was declined. But it does, in its
awkward way, illustrate a basic point, which is that the imprimatur of
a doctorate still means something, is still valued, as are the
standards of academic honesty that accompanies it. We–being academics
who put our ideals above careerism and venture into the digital wilds
under our own name—we might we be able to raise the level of the
discourse, disabuse a skeptical public of the stereotype of ivory tower
elitism? Probably not.</p>
<p>Goldberg might’ve offered a hand to the grad student he’d just
slapped down, but he’s not interested in the evidentiary and
argumentative standards we, as academics, value. If we want a co-equal
audience, we’re going to have to cultivate it ourselves, because
Goldberg and his ilk don’t want to internalize our values—they want to
appropriate our authority, our tone, and if we let them—if we allow
their imitations to go unchallenged, the expert on the Great Depression
on the evening news (or, as I just learned this morning, the History
Channel) won’t be my co-blogger at <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/">The Edge of the American West</a>, Eric Rauchway—it’ll be Jonah Goldberg.&nbsp; A brief example of why, exactly, this is worrisome:</p>
<p>In 2005, while (scare quotes) researching what would become <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385511841/diesekoschmar-20">Liberal Fascism</a>—about which, more shortly—Goldberg posted to the Corner <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NWUyZjk2YWFhNTUyYzhjNTM3ZGNmNzcxMzU5ZDc4Njg=">the following request</a>:</p>
<p>Wanted, he wrote, in big bold letters, Herbert Spencer Expert:</p>
<p>Quote: I’m working on a chapter of the book which requires me to
read a lot about and by Herbert Spencer. There’s simply no way I can
read all of it, nor do I really need to. [NOR DO I REALLY NEED TO] But
if there are any real experts on Spencer out there — regardless of
ideological affiliation — I’d love to ask you a few questions in case
I’m missing something.</p>
<p>Because I’m sort of a Spencer expert—my dissertation was on
non-Darwinian evolutionary theories, most of which were heavily
indebted to Spencer and his brand of neo-Lamarckian thought—I
responded. And so he sent me a few drafty passages that partook of the
worst sort of anti-Spencerian slanders. Which, incidentally, made it
into the book almost unchanged, quote: “[Spencer's] interpretation of
evolutionary theory reinforced his view that people should be left
alone.” Needless to say, for a man whose body of work was too vast for
Goldberg to traverse himself, Spencer wasn’t all that complicated.</p>
<p>OR that Goldberg was oversimplifying things, as I gently—in true
teacherly mode—informed him. I cited his work on altruism, some of the
letters he exchanged with Huxley on the subject, and provided him a
brief, focused bibliography that would disabuse him of the idea that
Spencer opposed intervention on principle.</p>
<p>He responded, haughtily, that other people said Spencer thought
people were best left alone, and that he was a classical, STRESS, an
ALL CAPS CLASSICAL liberal.</p>
<p>I replied, politely, that those other people were wrong.</p>
<p>He then inquired as to WHY DID THEY WRITE IT THEN?</p>
<p>When I told him that Spencer’s the most misunderstood thinker of the
19th Century, he told me I hadn’t helped him at all and that I
shouldn’t write back.</p>
<p>Now, I know what you’re thinking: scholars, professional and amateur
alike, can have legitimate disagreements, and maybe this is one of
those times. After all, <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGY3ODg1ZGEyYjQ0OTYxYzc0Yzc0ZDNhN2Q1MzhjMDE=">he’d written of his then-forthcoming book</a>,
quote, that it “isn’t like Dinesh [D'Souza]’s latest book. It isn’t
like any Ann Coulter book. It isn’t what the Amazon description says or
what the Economist claims it is [o]r what Frank Rich imagines it is
[but] a very serious, thoughtful argument that has never been made in
such detail or with such care.”</p>
<p>In such detail. Or with such care. Said the man who admitted he
needed, quote, “to read a lot about and by Herbert Spencer [but] there
was simply no way [he could] read all of it, NOR [DID HE] REALLY NEED
TO.</p>
<p>He was roundly, and rightly, mocked for his hubris, but the laughter
would’ve abated had his book not proven, as A.E. Housmann wrote of
Friedrich Jacob, that Goldberg’s “trade is one which requires, that it
may be practiced in perfection, two qualifications only: ignorance of
language and abstinence from thought.”</p>
<p>The ignorance of language is right there in his title, Liberal
Fascism, which proves that words are no different than people: just
because you put two next to each other doesn’t mean they’re actually
related; the abstinence from thought is, well, EVERYWHERE, but begins
with the subtitle, The Secret History of the American Left, from
Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning. Even had he not confused
Mussolini for an American, the unseriousness of his argument would
outed itself quickly. I quote:</p>
<p>“Animal rights advocates correctly note that animal rights activism
was a major concern in pre-Nazi Germany . . . [b]ut the fact that these
conventionally leftist views were held by Nazis suggests that Nazism
isn’t as alien to mainstream progressive thought as some would have us
believe.”</p>
<p>Again, I know what you’re thinking: why should reputable scholars
waste our time with people who don’t know from the fallacy of the
undistributed middle? Short answer: because Goldberg’s more popular
than we are. Liberal Fascism’s sold over 200,000 copies—that’s
hardcover, the paperback’s not due until 2009—and its popularity can be
attributed to what he’s stolen from us; namely, the arguments of
countless scholars whose work Goldberg has grossly misrepresented.
Movement conservatives read Ann Coulter, but they don’t cite her as an
authority because she has none; neither does Goldberg, but he’s written
a book with—as any acolyte of his will tell you again, and again, and
again—with over 600 footnotes!</p>
<p>And FOOTNOTES, I don’t need to tell you, are our thing.</p>
<p>But if the only people the public sees employing footnotes do so
expressly to dissemble—to cherry-pick their sources and practice serial
misprison—and not unconsciously, as Harold Bloom would have it—if this
is all the public sees of scholarship, our reputation suffers twice
over: to Goldberg and the movement conservatives who read him, we’re
diminished by the perpetuation of the idea that we’re ivory tower
elites. As Liberal Fascism’s jacket copy reads, quote, “The
quintessential liberal fascist isn’t an SS storm trooper; it is a
female grade-school teacher with an education degree from Brown or
Swarthmore.”</p>
<p>And to anyone who cares to check Goldberg’s footnotes, we’re
diminished by association—once someone sees how easy it is to deceive
through citation—through 600 CITATIONS—they’re liable to lose trust in
the scholarly apparatus itself.&nbsp; This isn’t a responsibility we can
abdicate, I don’t think.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Thank you.</p></blockquote>

<p>&quot;Eschaton is little more than a link-aggregator&quot;</p>

<p>Not that it really matters for your talk, but that isn&#39;t right.  He shapes opinion through three main methods: choice of link plus a one-sentence framing of the link, ideas that he creates via repetition attached to links (i.e. the Friedman unit), and completely unlinked, very short passages that crystalize everything that had come before (c.f. his statement that the financial crisis is not a liquidity problem because the money is lost, &quot;all gone&quot;).  You&#39;re missing out on a quite important and powerful set of rhetorical tactics by calling him a link aggregator.  He&#39;s a ... very short essayist?</p>

<p>&quot;and not unconsciously, as Harold Bloom would have it&quot;  </p>

<p>Did Bloom defend Goldberg specifically, or was this some general statement he made about footnotes?  The first would be pretty laughable.</p>

<p>&quot;This isn’t a responsibility we can abdicate, I don’t think. &quot;</p>

<p>The problem with treating it as a responsibility is that in politics, responsibilities require effects.  What effect did your criticism of Goldberg actually have?  Has it ever been quoted in an attack on Goldberg?  Has Goldberg ever had to bother to defend himself against it?  Goldberg is still chugging along, made fun of by everyone, but with none of that mattering to his core political task; demonizing liberalism to the GOP base.</p>

<p>What would actually decrease his ability to do this, given that he will never feel shame, and that the money will never run out?  In these cases, I generally think that the person has to be baited into an arena in which they can lose.  They can then go back and bluster to their fans that they didn&#39;t lose, but something within them has snapped, and they are never as effective after that.  I vaguely remember aspects of the Horowitz / Berube debates as being similar.<br />

		<span id="comment-136763415-content"><p>Well, Jordan, I&#39;m not going to be saying anything that the excellent Washington Post review of the book hasn&#39;t said already, but &quot;fascism&quot; is an extremely <i>unreasonable</i> term for what FDR was doing. FDR did not have personal roots in the fascist movement, and the Fascists did not invent governmental participation in the economy. Was Teddy Roosevelt&#39;s trust-busting therefore &quot;fascism,&quot; before the word had even been invented? In the end, you are just using &quot;fascist&quot; as a negatively-associated word for government of any kind. </p>

<p>Obviously, the book wasn&#39;t very well-researched, or did you completely miss Scott&#39;s point?</p>

<blockquote>Now, can someone explain to me how religious fanatics who believe in free markets and small government are &quot;American Fascists&quot;?</blockquote>

<p>Nope, nobody can, as this would also be a misnomer. I don&#39;t like the religious right in America, nor do I like the libertarians, but relatively few people in both groups could legitimately be considered fascist.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-138437354-content"><p>The current state of the &quot;intelligentia&quot; on the right is disgraceful. There is one important reason for this: nepotism.  Those considered the &quot;commentariate&quot; or the &quot;intelligentia&quot; on the right have gotten there not because of what they know or their own abilities, but because of who they are related to. This &quot;nepotisagentia&quot; includes  Bill Kristol, Jonah Goldberg, Robert Kagan, Fred Kagan, and some others, not all of whom I know.  It is interesting, to this point, that Buckley has actually become, in the course of this election, his own person.  He has rejected Palinism, and this has led to his ouster from his father&#39;s magazine, a departure partly engineered by himself, and partly his being forced out by lesser beings (kremlinology is not my strong suit).  </p>

<p>But the intellectual capitol of this group is very small.  Kristol is a commentator, but is simply unable to stop himself from commentating, even when he is called upon to make neutral statements.  He is not a journalist, but a right-wing-politician in writer&#39;s clothing.  Kagan and Kagan are incompetents of the very most clear manner.  Robert Kagan is called upon in many cases on NPR programs, and he intones his bullshit and claptrap without anyone calling him on it.  The man has said many things since PNAC days of 1997, and none NONE of it not a single sentence has been correct.</p>

<p>This &quot;nepotistigencia&quot; is basically a warmed-over soup of opinion unleavened by the smallest sprinkle of reason.  It&#39;s really quite embarrassing. </p></span>

<p>I believe that you are a scholar, but in your criticism of Goldberg, whose book I haven&#39;t read, you malign his research yet provide not one example of a misused footnote. In the interest of the dignity of scholarship, should not you do this? Your writing is highly personal and emotional, not detached and factual.</p>

<p>For instance, even in the case of your own proclaimed field, Spencer, you make no attempt to positively state what was wrong with the passage. You may have informed GOLDBERG [dreaded all caps] of what would have better characterized Spencer&#39;s beliefs, but you did not tell us. Instead, you have forced us to simple take your word for it: you are right because you are an academic expert and he is wrong because he is not.</p>

<p>I apologize if this appears too hostile. I sincerely like to be educated by those with knowledge.</p></span>

<p>This was a short panel presentation, so I didn&#39;t delve into too much detail.  A more detailed criticism can be found <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/i-recognize-i-c.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  (I say &quot;more,&quot; not &quot;fully,&quot; because Goldberg refused me permission to reprint his private emails, as is his prerogative, and I refuse to reprint private emails without their author&#39;s permission, as is mine.)</p>

<p><em>You may have informed GOLDBERG [dreaded all caps] of what would have better characterized Spencer&#39;s beliefs, but you did not tell us.</em></p>

<p>As I note earlier in the post, those all caps aren&#39;t of the dreaded variety, merely diacritical: they remind me when to emphasize a word when I say it aloud.</p>

<p><em>I apologize if this appears too hostile. I sincerely like to be educated by those with knowledge.</em></p>

<p>A little testy, maybe, but not hostile, so no worries.  (And understandably testy, at that, given that I somehow neglected to include a link to my other posts on Goldberg.)<br />

A wonderful time will be had by all. As Ari will tell you, my slagging of Jonah Goldberg is unparalleled. It isn’t like a Sadly, No! slagging. It is a very serious, thoughtful slagging that has never been made in such detail or with such care. (Largely because I quote him at length, but still.)</span></a></div>
