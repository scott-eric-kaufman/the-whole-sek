After struggling through her introduction and the first half of this chapter, I think I understand the argument: vigorously upper-class depictions Anglo-American subjects constitute an attempt by the social elite used the Spencerian idea of progress to counter what they perceived as Darwinian red-in-tooth-and-claw nihilism. Paintings like The Little White Girl secure the historic privileges of the elite not only by preserving its aesthetic but by grafting that aesthetic onto a confused Spencerian utopianism. I buy that argument as far as it goes, but I'm disinclined to trust it when I slam into paragraphs like this one: Whistler's spiritualist beliefs and practices in the 1870s would become all-important to his development of a landscape of the unconscious that is evoked through a feminized color mode and the body of woman. As his first attempt to construct an image of the soul, The Little White Girl is ambivalent: while the female body is constricted by masculine will and geometric structuring, the power of feminine imagination, signified in the masklike face and dreaming eye of the mirror image, eludes such rational definition. Whistler attempted to master, control, and constrict the female figure within the geometry imposed by the intellectual act of ordering. The feminine realm of the imagination, concretized in the mirror in the upper region of the canvas, however, remains finally elusive to the willful imposition of limiting, masculine reason. What I do understand about the above paragraph is that it: proceeds from a typical alignment of imagination (good) with the feminine and reason (bad) with the masculine; moves to show how these feminine and masculine principles are in tension; and that privileges the feminine and everything which &quot;eludes such rational definition.&quot; What baffles me is the unverifiability of the claims Pyne makes. She claims Whistler attempts to &quot;master, control, and constrict the female figure within the geometry imposed by the intellectual act of ordering,&quot; but when I look at the painting, that analysis strikes me as utterly contingent upon possibilities she never addresses. Did Whistler choose to paint Joanna Hiffernan indoors or was he commissioned to do so? If commissioned, was it raining heavily for that period of time, and if so, could that have influenced Whistler's decision to paint Hiffernan leaning wistfully against the mantle? Shouldn't the circumstances of a painting's production factor into an analyis of its content? Or am I importing my own (frequentlyl unfulfilled) historicist expectations into art history?" />

		<span id="comment-5822737-content"><p>Yes, of course, the circumstances of a painting&#39;s production may be factored into an analysis of its &quot;content&quot;.  But we don&#39;t need to pursue that line of argument to object to the argument Pyne&#39;s making (taking your word for how she continues it).</p>

<p>Even if we grant that the reflected face &quot;eludes&quot; the strict geometry of the overall composition (put this way, not a bad observation), we should try to remember that <i>Whistler painted them both</i>.  The elusion and dreaming are his just as much as the constriction and ordering.  And if we want to argue that the elusion means the ordering has failed, we have a long row to hoe.</p>

<p>One reason she looks tall (apart from the fact that she fills the frame) is that the reflected face is below the direct face; assuming the mirror is vertical, that implies we&#39;re looking up at her, at rather a steep angle.  But her far shoulder looks higher than the near shoulder, as though we were looking down.  We could justify this by imagining contortions, but it&#39;s more parsimonious to allow that the perspective is inconsistent.  It&#39;s this, I think, that most obviously makes the face float free of the &quot;geometry&quot; of the composition....an effect that could obviously have been planned.  Or not.<br />

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/monday_morning_.html"><span><strong>Monday Morning Office-Blogging: Other(ing)(ed) Cultural Studies</strong> This intolerable situation in which I can't type on my laptop without recreating some conditions typical to California but which, to be frank, frighten me beyond the thought of them...this intolerable situation forces me to post some unsatisfying entires. Exhibit #1: Yesterday's hurried post on Mailer, which I will get around to revising shortly. In the meantime, satisfy your acephalitic dependence with another installment of &lt;booming voice&gt; From The Archives &lt;/booming voice&gt;. In 1917, cultural studies meant something entirely different from the anti-disciplinarian, anti-foundational, self-contradictory and lovin' it characterized by the thought of scholars like Teresa Ebert, who say things like Whether postmodernism is seen as what Fredric Jameson calls &quot;the cultural logic of late capitalism&quot; or is associated with the writings of Jean-Francois Lyotard and Jean Baudrillard, with Derridean poststructuralists or Lacanian psychoanalysis, it has intimated the end of transformative politics. Throw in some Foucauldian nonsense about power producing its own immantent plurality of resistances--for, as Foucault says, &quot;where there is power, there is resistance&quot;--and you have a template for much of the radical and liberatory work done under the aegis of Cultural Studies. Lump together the postmodern heavyweights, claim they're all saying the same thing--when, in truth, their nonsense is highly idiosyncratic, as is required by the neologism-happy French academe--and then build a claim on some ungentle tweakings of the whole mess. But it didn't have to come to this. In his 1917 article &quot;Wanted: A Bureau of Definition,&quot; Edwin M. Hopkins supports a &quot;cultural studies&quot; program which, instead of training people how to think like someone else, would allow them to demystify themselves: Since at first we can build on our own experience only, and are alive only to a small part of that until the observation has been trained, we presumably always shall find it well to begin our training with studies of more practical type; but still we are likely to require a so-called cultural study to bring from our subconscious-ness the cognition of the largest and finest part of our own personal experience without regard to the further wealth that comes from sources outside ourselves. Hence, though what we call cultural studies are under present conditions of training far more necessary in education than they may be in time to come, they always will be necessary in order to secure the broadest experience, the most complete usefulness, and therefore the fullest life, to the individual mind. So our bureau might give its heartiest indorsement to manual training, domestic art, and every vocational study, and recommend all for the fullest credit in college or elsewhere, but at the same time require with equal emphasis that every such study must be so directed as to train the imagination, and to train it on all sides, and then insist on such further complementary training for the imagination as may be necessary or desirable. (143) What I find most compelling about this definition, esp. in comparison to the radical and liberatory training in Marxist, feminist, post-colonial, etc. thought...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/ja_ich_habe_poc.html"><span><strong>Ja, Ich Habe Pockenangst! or Important People Throwing, Part II</strong> I'm starting a collection of amusing anecdotes about famous people throwing. Here's the second one I've found, from Richard Preston's The Demon in the Freezer. A Western doctor named Larry Brilliant is studying with Neem Karoli Baba, one of the most influential mystics in India during Indira Gandhi's time as Prime Minister. &quot;The Blanket Baba,&quot; so-called because his sole possession was a plaid blanket, encouraged Brilliant to seek employment with the World Heatlh Organization. Brilliant explains: So I said, &quot;What do I do?&quot; And he said, &quot;Go to New Delhi. Go to the office of the World Health Organization. Go get your job. Jao, jao, jao jao.&quot; That means, &quot;Go, go, go, go.&quot; After a 17 hour journey, Brilliant arrived in New Dehli and met with Dr. Nicole Grasset, who informed him that WHO had no job to offer him. Brilliant journeyed 17 hours back to the Blanket Baba's ashram and informed him of his failure. &quot;Did you get your job?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Go back and get it.&quot; Brilliant returned to New Dehli, again talked to Dr. Grasset, and again returned to the ashram without &quot;his&quot; job. &quot;I went back and forth between New Dehli and the ashram at least a dozen times. All my teacher kept saying was, 'Don't worry, you'll get your job. Smallpox will be unmulun, uprooted.' When at the ashram, Brilliant meditated. He would assume the lotus position, shut his eyes, and utter the sacred word Aummmmm. Neem Karoli Baba would notice he was meditating, and he would walk up to Brilliant, yank an apple out from under his blanket, and throw it at Brilliant's testicles. There would a whack! and Brilliant's Aummmmm would turn into Oww God! My balls! and he would assume the &quot;writhing lotus&quot; position on the floor. The guru seemed to be hinting, Brilliant says now, that he needed to stand up and on his feet and get back to the WHO in New Dehli, where his job awaited. Based on my own very, very limited knowledge of Hinduism--by which I mean &quot;that time I read Vikram Chandra's Red Earth and Pouring Rain--I'm not altogether surprised to learn that Neem Karoli Baba was a Hanuman devotee. Make of my profound ignorance in this (as in all) matters what you will.</span></a></div>
