		<span id="comment-149232163-content"><p>The study was completed last year. Why report on it now? Because it&#39;s a perfect opportunity to confect a morality play pertaining to the &quot;economic crisis&quot; (ie, depression) the US faces. Predictably, people will be horrified. What about &quot;personal responsibility&quot;? And of course what this means is that the fact that such a response from students is entirely in keeping with the logic of the culture which surrounds them will be lost. Let&#39;s go back to Theodor Adorno for an insight:</p>

<p> &quot;What has become alien to men is the human component of culture, its closest part, which upholds them against the world. They make common cause with the world against themselves, and the most alienated condition of all, the omnipresence of commodities, their own conversion into appendages of machinery, is for them a mirage of closeness. &quot;</p>

<p>The root of the problem, then, is not ungrateful or cynical students gaming a bankrupt system, but the society which makes such activity seem necessary. IN a world modeled after the market-- which is, in a word, false-- is such falsity surprising?</p></span>

Vance and I have been back-channeling about Watchmen this past week. It occurs to me that there's no sense in wasting my brilliant thoughts on an audience of one (!?!) when I could be sharing them with all the world. Vance agreed. Our first quibble concerns the look of Dave Gibbon's panels. Vance insists the panels looked dated. He's not wrong. But before we discuss some of his limitations, we should attend to Gibbons' strength: layout. Consider these panels again: Gibbons purposely centers the first panel on nothing in order to force the reader to search for the photograph. Your eyes gravitate to the center. Nothing there. So you move them to the portion of the panel which contains actual information: up and to the right. Gibbons draws your attention into the center panel. The strong version of this argument would be that he accomplishes this by aligning the photograph such that your eye is drawn from the center of the panel, through the photograph, then to the text at the top of the center panel like so: The weak version would claim that Gibbons does this through color. The display itself almost functions like a purple arrow (minus the stalk) pointing at the predominantly purple center panel. The blue of Manhattan's jacket would then perform a similar bridging function from the second panel to the third. Note that he also disconnects Manhattan from himself. By centering the center panel on her and the right panel on him, Gibbons puts space (literally) between the man in the picture and the god on Mars. The repetition of the smooth line of Manhattan's right shoulder in both panels makes it seem as if the image skips because someone removed a few frames from the reel. In an issue in which nostalgia is achieved by moving through time and re- or pre-living an event (from the perspective of the narrative present), this slight technical success unobtrusively reinforces the larger theme. You likely noticed the weak and strong versions of my argument can (and do) coexist. Each of the three elements of the text (script, composition, color) augment the other two. Such synergy is rare (and likely a function of Moore's notoriously precise scripts), and in terms of the visual style of the book, sets Watchmen far above its peers. Put differently: Watchmen looks dated in the same way (and for the same reason) a Caravaggio like this one does: it fails to meet the photorealistic standards of a future era. We praise Caravaggio for his sense of composition and use of color. We should extend the same sympathy to Gibbons. The fact that a Caravaggio looks more photorealistic than any panel in Watchmen did not escape my notice. Gibbons and his inker, John Higgins, labored under the substantial material constraints: their lines and colors must...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/batman-begins-works-because-christopher-nolan-decided-to-spend-the-first-hour-and-twenty-minutes-denying-the-audience-what-it.html"><span><strong>Batman as a Monster in a Classic Horror Film (Batman Begins)</strong> (Someone sent me an email asking if I thought Nolan had shot Batman like a monster in a horror film in the fundraiser scene. I replied that I had not. But when I taught Batman Begins last quarter I taught it as a horror film. What follows are lightly-redacted notes for that class. It may read a little staccato.) Christopher Nolan spends the first ninety-three minutes of Batman Begins denying his audience what they paid to experience: the vicarious thrill of costumed vigilantism. The film opens with a violent tease (Wayne beating back multiple attackers in a Bhutanese prison) before settling into an almost leisurely sequence of expository flashbacks. That Nolan sustains any narrative tension while recapitulating the most famous origin story in comic history testifies to the talent that made Memento more than the sum of its gimmicks. He pushes the narrative forward on three fronts: from his childhood to the death of Thomas and Martha Wayne; from their death to his imprisonment in Bhutan; and from his release from prison forward (the narrative present). Setting the narrative pace so slow ensures that the first glimpse of Wayne in full regalia will bring the catharsis. Or would have had Nolan's direction not transformed Batman into a monster. Cut to the docks. The corrupt Detective Flass and mobster Carmine Falcone oversee the delivery of a drug shipment. The stevedores load boxes into the back of a truck: Cut back to Flass and Falcone discussing the drugs in a limo: Then back to the stevedores. Note that the stevedores are directly beneath a cone of warm light of the sort being put out by the light in the background: Nolan chooses a deep shot here because he wants you to know how far the stevedore must travel to deposit that box onto the back of the truck. He cuts back to Flass and Falcone discussing drugs (similar to above) then back to the stevedore carrying the box: Only that is not the stevedore with the box. Nolan confounds the conventions of continuity editing by violating the 180° rule. If a car careens off the right side of the screen it should emerge from the left in the next shot. (Otherwise.) Figures moving away from us should continue to move away from us. But Nolan aims to disorient here. He crosses the 180° line and follows the hooded man who had been moving toward us. (Note that he had been under one cone of light in the shot above and walks toward another. The stevedore with the box also walked toward a cone of light. We now know that this stretch of warehouse is illuminated by three lights.*) By the time we realize where we are and who we see, the hooded stevedore has nearly traversed the fraught space between him and the storage unit: Note the classic horror blinds to his left and right. One more cut to the stevedore with the box establishes the forthcoming reaction shot: The hooded stevedore...</span></a></div>
