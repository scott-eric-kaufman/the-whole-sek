				<p>[1]From Ben Marcus' <em>The Age of Wire and String</em>:</p>

<p>&quot;Intercourse with Resuscitated Wife&quot;</p>

<p>Intercourse with
resuscitated wife for particular number of days, superstitious act
designed to insure safe operation of household machinery. Electricity
mourns the absence of the energy form (wife) within the household’s
walls by stalling its flow to the outlets. As such, an improvised
friction needs to take the place of electricity, to goad the natural
currents back to their proper levels. This is achieved with the dead
wife. She must be found, revived, and then penetrated until heat fills
the room, until the toaster is shooting bread onto the floor, until she
is smiling beneath you with black teeth and grabbing your bottom. Then
the vacuum rides by and no one is pushing it, it is on full steam. Days
flip past in chunks of fake light, <span class="hilite">and</span> the intercourse is placed in the back <span class="hilite">of</span>
the mind. But it is always there, that moving into a static-ridden
corpse that once spoke familiar messages in the morning when the sun
was new. </p>

<p>&quot;Snoring, Accidental Speech&quot;</p>

<p> Snoring,
language disturbance caused by accidental sleeping, in which a person
speaks in compressed syllables <span class="hilite">and</span>
bulleted syntax, often stacking several words over one another in a
distemporal deliverance of a sentence. The snoring person can be
stuffed with cool air to slow the delivery <span class="hilite">of</span>
its language, but perspiration froths at key points on the hips and
back when artificial air is introduced, and thus the sleep becomes
sketchy <span class="hilite">and</span> riddled with noise. It is often best to cull the sleeper forth with apneic barks-<del>sounds produced without air. The effect of the barks is to isolate each aspect <span class="hilite">of</span> the snore sound by slowing down the delivery</del>-riding the sleeper until the snore breaks into separate words. Decoders should sit on the bed <span class="hilite">and</span>
jostle the sleeper’s stomach. This further dispatches the clusters that
often form when the sleeper speaks all at once (snores). The decoder is
then better able to decipher the word blocks. When analyzed, the
messages are often simple. Pull me out, they say, the water has risen
to the base <span class="hilite">of</span> my neck.</p>

		<span id="comment-7666151-content"><p>Scott, not sure what to make of these last two passages.  Are you trying your hand at surrealistic short fiction?  As for your day-in-the-life post, it pretty much confirms what I&#39;d suspected.  Your day consists of work, brief intellectual excursions, prosaic interactions with your significant other, and fleeting moments of introspection/self doubt.  And by day&#39;s end it sounds as if you typically achieve some degree, however minimal, of progress on that curious dissertation.  </p>

<p>Questions (of the formal variety):  Do you frequent the library?  Or are you pretty much set with what you have at home?  Do you let your wife or anyone else read your dissertation?  </p>

<p>Questions: (of the informal variety) Did you ever have a class with Derrida?  Can you explain to me the metaphysics of presence fallacy?  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-7673570-content"><p>padmini, I&#39;ve a long, long way to go.  I&#39;d say at least another year, possibly longer.  All this pesky &quot;research&quot; that must be done before writing slows me down.</p>

<p>Jonathan, thanks for not outing the wife and I.  As to the line, it involves Chris Eigeman, his young Jersey girlfriend, a contested parking spot, and begins: &quot;He&#39;d <i>already</i> rather be...&quot;</p>

<p>Mike, those last two passages are the Ben Marcus stories &quot;below the fold.&quot;  Of course, if you read the post directly there&#39;s no evidence of the fold; so I&#39;ll edit that to make it easier to understand.  Now, as for your questions:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t frequent the library so much right now because I&#39;ve already done the research for the chapter I&#39;m working on.  I&#39;ve either purchased, copied or checked out all the work I need.  The wife doesn&#39;t read my work right now, but will in the future.  The person who reads endless drafts of my work is a fellow graduate student, Stephen Schryer.  In fact, instead of commenting here I <i>should</i> finish commenting on the chapter on Mary McCarthy he sent me yesterday.  (But I&#39;m on holiday for half an hour.)  I highly, <i>highly</i> recommend you acquire yourself a Schryer or two when you get to grad. school, as it will vastly improve the quality of your work.  Knowing that you have actual readers means you have to consider audience; too often, as other&#39;s have recently noted, graduate student work reads like <a href="http://crazyphd.blogspot.com/2005/07/masturbation-and-academic-writing.html" rel="nofollow">intellectual masturbation</a>, i.e. work written solely to please its author and which never considers the possibility that it may be read.  The knowledge that it <i>will</i> be read, immediately, by someone whose opinion you respect (but who isn&#39;t a professor, as that&#39;s a different story), puts demands on the prose that it would otherwise lack; namely, that it communicate.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve mentioned before that I did, in fact, participate in one of Derrida&#39;s seminars (and two of Hillis Miller&#39;s); that said, it would be <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/a_very_unfunny_.html" rel="nofollow">difficult for me</a> put the metaphysics of presence in its proper nutshell.  I could make some breathtakingly vague statements, but they&#39;d be as useless to you and reveal me for the fraud that I am.  So I won&#39;t.  </p>

<p>And I&#39;m a Beatles fan the way of lots of people are Beatles fans: I have a favorite Beatle, own pretty much all the albums and know all the words on them, but for some reason haven&#39;t listened to them in years.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-7674744-content"><p>Sorry, Scott, not gonna let you off the hook that easily.  However breathtakingly vague your gloss may be, I need The Kaufman to reduce the metaphysics of presence to an intelligble (and probably oversimplified) soundbyte.  The only reason I&#39;m keeping on you about this is because a couple semesters back I wrote a brief (3-4 pages) essay on the m.o.p.&#39;s implications for the study of rhetoric.  Now, you&#39;re likely wondering why I feel the need to pester you with this when I&#39;ve already come to some of my own conclusions about this slightly arcane concept/theory/metaphysical hogwash.  The reason I&#39;m interested in your thoughts is because in your posts, blogs, and banter you&#39;ve proven yourself to be a logical, scrupulous, and articulate fellow.  Pardon the unseemly number of complements I&#39;ve given you this past week, but...well...I like you, Scott.  You&#39;re honest and good-humored, and it&#39;s refreshing to know we&#39;ve chosen the same profession.  Okay, now get to work on that m.o.p. post!  Perhaps it ties in with some of those Wittgenstein pieces you&#39;ve been perusing.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-19901217-content"><p>Scott, in revisiting this thread, it occurred to me that this &quot;day in the life&quot; snapshot (or feature length film, depending on you look at it) takes place in the very recent past (ie: during the final phase of your academic training).  When convenient, and provided you feel generous and nostalgic enough to do it, how about a prequel to this post entitled, &quot;A Day in the Life: Year One?&quot;  My interest in peeking in on a young S E Kaufman during those first few quarters of coursework at UCI has only to do with the fact that, in a few more fortnights, I will start my own graduate program.  A typical day&#39;s tasks/responsibilities in September will differ considerably from my current ones.  So take a break from psychoanalysis, Scott, and dust off your memories of 1999 or 2000 or whenever you started.  </p></span>

<p>For the record, TypePad really needs a better system for alerting bloggers why spam&#39;s being flagged.  All I get when I comment is a little message on a white page telling me that TypePad&#39;s marked my comment as spam and that it won&#39;t be posted.  But TypePad doesn&#39;t send me an email indicating why some spam&#39;s been blocked, so I can&#39;t even white-list people like, say, myself.</p></span>

Why you chose to email me instead of leaving your logic in the comment box is something I could think about, but Bill Pannapacker captures, if not the fact (as some have argued), then at least the mind-set that would compel people to console my idiotic fears privately: Blogs are a useful tool for people on the margins of the profession. They help to break up the control of editorial boards and conference committees over the acceptable range of professional discourse. But it will be a long time before they are regarded as a legitimate venue for scholarly discussion; participation in them is not likely to help, and it could do a lot to harm one's career, if that is what matters most. Let me be the first to admit that I think the nerve Pannapacker touched is raw for a reason: we really don't know what we're doing. We are on the margins of academia (or, in Ray's case, beyond them), and we are inclined to dance when someone questions the validity and viability of what we're doing. (Not that Pannapacker said or implied that; any consideration of what we are or aren't doing strikes the same nerve. It's not his fault we're so jumpy.) By &quot;we are on the margins of the academy,&quot; I don't mean to imply that we're all on the same margins. McCann's a force in the field and Holbo and the Miriams are internet celebrities. Jonathan, um, Jonathan's Jonathan. His position's so cryptic as to defy description. (But I suspect he too is an internet celebrity. Only incognito.) And then there's me. I'm writing a dissertation. I've never been published. I'm not on the margins so much as the testing grounds. Will I succeed? Who knows. I don't anticipate ticker-tape parades, but I clench my fists in futile prayer that I'll land a job somewhere someday. But who knows. Maybe someday people like Walter Benn Michaels won't be objects of discussions on blogs but authors of position-blogs about their work. (Am I auguring a rigged prophecy? Wouldn't you like to know.) My point is only that the status of what we write on our blogs is subject to changes beyond our ability to predict. Maybe what I'm writing need only adhere to the casual constraints which govern the lion's share of blogs out there. Then again, maybe it ought to adhere to far more rigorous standards, as I thought when I posted my contribution to the Theory's Empire event. I included 29 footnotes. The next highest number? None. That's not a criticism but an admission of confusion. I wrote a Frankenstein &quot;blessay.&quot; The reason there's more &quot;essay&quot; than &quot;blog&quot; in that neologism is because there was more essay than blog in my contribution. I didn't know quite what...</span></a></div>

How else to describe a man who could continue to produce short stories and novels for nearly sixty years after his own death? He may never have written the Great American Novel (which more on shortly), but he was America's Greatest Living Novelest. At least until his timely death in 1974. When the editorial board of Library Journal said &quot;The Library of America is starting off with a bang in 1999,&quot; they didn't jest: the Library of America scored quite the coup. Forthcoming editions include: his (unpublished) novel about three starving German socialites after the Great War, The Wings of the Pigeon (1931) his (unpublished) sequel to The Ambassadors, the scathing Chamberlain (1939) his (unpublished) update to The Siege of London (1883) entitled The Seige of London (1942) his (unpublished) account of the death of humanism and the increasingly technocratic nature of political power, Washington Squares (1948) his (unpublished) paean to domesticity in the '50s, The Diary of a Man of One-Hundred and Fifty (1952) his (unpublished) biography of the young Charles Van Doren, The Pupil (1957) his (unpublished) sequel to his (unpublished) biogrpahy of the young Charles Van Doren, The Pupil?!? (1958) his (unpublished) story of a young woman's entrance into and rebellion against society, titled The Private-Life-Is-Political (1968) his (unpublished) shameful novella written shortly before his death, The Beasts Rumble in the Jungle (1974)</span></a></div>
