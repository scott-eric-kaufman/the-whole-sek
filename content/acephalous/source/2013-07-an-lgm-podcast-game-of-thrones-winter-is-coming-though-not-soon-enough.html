        <meta name="description" content="Steven Attewell and I decided that we didn't want to wait until next February to continue talking about Game of Thrones, and so we decided to start over. Here's our take on &quot;Winter Is Coming,&quot; the serie's inaugural episode. I'm including links to the works I referenced and will have Steven do the same. Works SEK discusses: Game of Thrones - &quot;Winter Is Coming&quot; for Poor Will Game of Thrones - &quot;Winter Is Coming&quot; for Bran Game of Thrones - &quot;Winter Is Coming&quot; for Catelyn Stark and Jon Snow Game of Thrones - &quot;Winter Is Coming&quot; for Will and Bran Works Attewell discusses: Game of Thrones – Prologue (Will, Gared, and Ser Waymar beyond the Wall, and class inequality within the Night’s Watch) Game of Thrones – Bran I (the execution of the Night’s Watch deserter and the direpups, Ned Stark’s theory of personal power) Game of Thrones – Catelyn I (Catelyn brings bad news to the Godswood, Jon Arryn as hand and explorations into feudalism) Game of Thrones – Daenerys I (Daenerys meets her future husband, conflicting historical memories of Robert’s Rebellion) Game of Thrones – Eddard I (Eddard and Robert down in the crypts, Robert as Henry VIII, and the Wardens Cardinal) Game of Thrones – Jon I (Jon meets Tyrion and is super-emo, how GRRM exaggerates medieval bastardy) Game of Thrones – Catelyn II (Catelyn gets a letter from her sister, Catelyn’s political skills, the nature of the Hand) Game of Thrones – Arya I (Arya doesn’t like sewing, Westerosi Punnett squares and not jumping to conclusions) Game of Thrones – Bran II (Bran goes climbing, introduction to the Lannister Conspiracy) Video: Audio: You can listen to the above podcast here. Archives: Our very civilized discussion of the premiere (S03E01). Fancy-talking about “Dark Wings, Dark Words” (S03E02). Here we are blathering on about “Walk of Punishment” (S03E03). Don’t watch — because you can’t — us discuss “And Now His Watch Has Ended” (S03E04). The rudely interrupted first half of our discussion of “Kissed by Fire” (S03E05). The second half of our discussion of religion in “Kissed by Fire” (S03E05). In which we discuss “The Climb” sans spoilers (S03E06). “The Climb” with spoilers (S03E06). “Second Sons.” We has them (S03E08). Belatedly, “The Bear and the Maiden Fair” (S03E07). You’re all invited to an epic performance of “The Rains of Castamere” (S03E09). This is the end ... the end of Season Three (S03E10)." />

In other words, my first two posts were about how Weiner creates tension via the visuals and sustains it by undermining the visuals that created it via the narrative. Most television shows — and most television writers — have a particular set of visual and narrative crutches they break out when they need to rouse their viewers. For example, Joss Whedon favors hackneyed speeches undermined by immediate circumstances: BUFFY: No, it doesn’t stop! It never stops! Do you — do you think I chose to be like this? You have any idea how lonely it is? How dangerous? I would love to be upstairs, watching TV or gossiping about boys or — God, even studying! But I have to save the world. Again. Or: LOKI: Enough! You are, all of you are beneath me! I am a god, you dull creature, and I will not be bullied by – (HULK flattens LOKI by SMASH) Whenever one of Whedon’s characters starts to speechify like William Wallace pontificating about the theoretical possibility of Scottish independence, that character’s likely to find his or her authority undermined either by their own words or someone else’s actions.* Whedon telegraphs it to a man who proceeds to semaphore it at your face. Which is why Mad Men continues to make for compelling television: Weiner and his writers are clearly aware of how they’re manipulating us and, like a great boxer, always slug us where we’re not expecting. Especially when they’ve established those expectations in a particular episode. In the last scene of this one, he combines the “Oh Really” sequence with its content-dependent and confessional opposite. To wit: He opens with this long shot of the Draper/Whitman family. They’re all clearly staring up at something, and because of the extremely high angle, seem to be dominated by whatever that something is. Establishing that something’s doing the dominating before actually showing it on screen has two effects: the first is to rouse our curiosity; the second, to remind us of what’s become obvious by now, i.e. that this family’s been burdened by an unknown and unspoken something for quite some time. Of course Don knows what it is, but to Sally, in particular, there’s just been this horrible presence that’s tainted her father’s relationships with everyone. She has no idea what it is, but this shot’s telling you here it is. But before cutting to this looming presence, Weiner thinks we need a refresher on how close this family is at the moment: These are the children. They’re together, but: They’re also apart from Don. Each slightly encroaches into the others’ shot, but for...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2013/07/it-contains-all-the-colors-of-the-rainbow-from-white-to-white.html"><span><strong>It contains all the colors of the rainbow, from white to white.*</strong> Before you laugh, you should know that intellectual heavyweights like the Internet's own Jeff Goldstein are a crucial part of the movement to make &quot;North Colorado&quot; the 51st state. The movement's &quot;willing to make our voices heard even while being labeled kooks and 'fringe' elements,&quot; which is a good thing, since it sounds like something concocted by kooky fringe elements. Who are these people? Don't know. But according to Jeff they represent a growing number of contiguous outlying counties that surround the Denver/Boulder doughnut hole owned by the hipsters and Democrats, and the many out-of-state (and illegally out-of-country) imports who have taken over Colorado government, at least for the time being[.] I wonder what those counties have in common? Let me see now: Kit Carson - 94.8 percent white Logan - 92.2 percent white Morgan - 92.8 percent white Phillips - 96.9 percent white Sedgewick - 96.0 percent white Washington - 96.2 percent white Weld - 93.4 percent white Yuma - 97.5 percent white They &quot;represent&quot; a group wants to form a state that will be on average 94.94 percent white. They specifically want to exclude urban areas like Denver County, which threatens their Great White Fever Dream with its 10.4 percent blackness. Not that their desire for a white state prevents them from explicitly comparing their plight to the Civil Rights Movement. Except if you scroll down, you'll see that their new white state will require that &quot;the streets run with blood like we've never seen before.&quot; (That sounds ominous until you remember how low a benchmark that is for shut-ins like these.) So it'll be just like the Civil Rights Movement, only with lots of guns and violence. I bet Jeff's sitting at home right now thinking about rolling naked on the floor -- I mean grappling -- and choking the life from some dusky liberal relativist. Because there's nothing racist about wanting to create a white state if it's just an accident of ideology that everyone invested in its creation is white. Unrelatedly: *Stolen from a comment David Cross made when I saw him perform at the Irvine Spectrum Center many years ago.</span></a></div>
