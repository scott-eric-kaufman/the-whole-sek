Can they really be this clueless? The painting in the Google link is, I think we can say with certainty, the one Genn referenced for his cover. (Compare everything from the neck down.) In visual terms, then, Lowry’s argument is thus: Keeping in mind that “[c]aricature always involves exaggerating someone’s distinctive features, which is all that our artist Roman Genn did with Sotomayor,” I think it’s obvious that the National Review didn’t insult Sotomayor. They merely exaggerated her distinctively slanted eyes—wait, can we compare the photo references for the cover again, only this time zoomed in on the eyes? As I suspected, the “someone” whose features are being “exaggerated” on the cover is neither Sotomayor nor Buddha, but the man so grand they named a peril after him: Wait—can I get another one of those closeups? That’s not an exaggeration of the racist depiction of Asians like Yellow Claw, that’s a racist depiction of Asians. The logic—such that it is—of the National Review editorial board seems to be that since everyone knows Asians are better than Latinos, no one can call them racist if they compare Sotomayor to an Asian.

<p>Ahistoricality, I was all set to write about the teeth, but decided that since I&#39;m making a strong claim here---that these were the actual pictures the editor, Lowry, sent to the artist, Genn---that the teeth could, arguably, be an artifact of <a href="http://levellers.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/sotommayor1.jpg" rel="nofollow">the photo itself</a>.

<p>The teeth are, imho, far weaker evidence than the eyes. The eyes are really blatant. The teeth aren&#39;t as exaggerated. The mouth seems to be a fairly typical caricature mouth, and its proportions are more natural than the mouth on the propaganda poster. She has large teeth, but they aren&#39;t pronounced buck teeth nor do they take up most of her lower face. Most of the Asian stereotype illustrations I&#39;ve seen show a smile that goes nearly from ear to ear and has huge upper teeth.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t change it that much. But most caricatures accentuate the teeth. The caricaturist at the state fair will probably accentuate your kids&#39; teeth. Search Google for political caricatures, and you&#39;ll find everyone from Sarah Palin to Tony Blair to Silvio Berlusconi with accentuated teeth and mouths. </p>

<p>Given the ridiculously racist eyes, I don&#39;t see any point harping on the mouth.</p></span>

<p>I can&#39;t comment on the others, but Tony Blair&#39;s teeth were accentuated because he was notorious, in the early years, for his perpetual inane grin.</p></span>

<p>I think we&#39;re going to have to agree to disagree. I don&#39;t think the mouth is exaggerated enough for it to be definitively racist. Maybe the artist was aiming to include both the mouth and eye stereotypes, but given how exaggerated the eyes are, I&#39;d think he would have exaggerated the mouth more than he did.</p></span>

Mel Allen, &quot;the Voice of the Yankees,&quot; was a lawyer by trade; his partner, Red Barber, caught his break while working as a janitor at a college radio station. (A professor scheduled to read &quot;Certain Aspects of Bovine Obstretics&quot; never showed, so Barber picked up the microphone and read it himself.) Jimmy Dudley majored in chemistry, got drafted and, like Harry Kalas, began his broadcasting career calling intramural games in the South Pacific during WWII. Although all four of them belong to the Baseball Hall of Fame, they were amateurs. The first great professional announcer, Vin Scully, studied broadcast journalism at Fordham. Following Scully's success on both coasts, team owners and network executives decided that games were best called by people whose sober, understated delivery betrayed an intimate knowledge of the technical limitations of their equipment. No matter where in America you turned on your radio or television in the 1960s, you were listening to a college graduate whose vocal coach had taught him to speak the smooth, unaccented English of an imaginary Middle America. With the exception of a few token athletes, like Joe Garagiola and Bob Uecker, by the early 1970s the voices that spoke for the game weren't the voices of the game. Because the game on the field is so different from the one observed from the booth, I think it best that there be someone up there who, for example, understands in his bones that the depth of field required to keep both the pitcher and the batter (60 feet 6 inches away) in focus makes a 67 m.p.h. curveball look slow even though, were it a car, it would have exceeded the interstate speed limit in ninety-percent of the country. I would hope that a wise former baseball player, with the richness of his playing experiences, would more often than not reach a better conclusion about a game situation than someone who hasn't lived the life. But I'm not so myopic as to believe that others of different experiences or backgrounds are incapable of understanding the game. Many are so capable. Gary Cohen could only play in Soviet Russia—when he picks up a bat, it swing hims—yet he is a tremendous announcer. However, for someone who didn't play the game to understand its nuances takes time and effort, something that not all people are willing to give. Personal experiences influence the facts that announcers chooses to discuss. But this is not to say that only former players can understand the game. Sometimes they emphasize their own experience to the exclusion of others, as is the case with Tim McCarver, for whom baseball has not changed one iota since the day he retired in 1979, and Joe Morgan, whose greatness on the diamond is inversely proportional to his awfulness in the booth. For a former player to become a good announcer, he must extrapolate from his experiences into areas which with...</span></a></div>

Employees of things. Employees of things who graduated from community colleges. Employees of things who graduated from community colleges and then found a decent enough job. Employees of things who graduated from community colleges and then found a decent enough job but are vulnerable to managerial whimsy. Such is Ed Whelan’s “argument.” If you work for a company that manufactures cat food, you shouldn’t be able to pseudonymously blog about your liberal politics if your boss is a conservative, because “revealing [your] identity breaches no ethical norm,” so everyone you argue with has the “right to tell [on you], for whatever reason it suit[s them] to tell it—including no particular reason at all other than that [they find] it useful at the moment [they do] it.” If your boss fires you because he disapproves of what he now knows to be your views, it’s your fault for having them while not being the President of your thing. (Because when you’re the President of your thing, only you can fire you for your views.) But if you’re not the President of your thing? That makes you an employee; which, following Whelan’s logic, means that you don’t have anything important to say, because you can’t have anything important to say, because people who haven’t already risen to being the President of their thing are worthless people. They shouldn’t be allowed to blog because, when they chatter about their unimportant views, the compel Presidents of things, like Ed Whelan, to listen and respond to them—even though whatever it is they say is, by definition, worthless. Because anything written by anyone with a threatenable job is, by definition, worthless. Unless, that is, they have “extraordinary circumstances in which the reason to use a pseudonym would be compelling.” Having “extraordinary circumstances” indicates that someone’s extraordinary enough to acquire high-caliber circumstances, which means that—despite not being the President of their thing—they are somehow important. What kinds of circumstances does Whelan consider extraordinary? Hard to tell what they are, but we know what they can’t be: they can’t be “private, family, [or] professional,” because when those were offered as reasons not to out someone, Whelan went ahead and, without ever inquiring as to what those reasons might be, outed publius anyway. That can only mean that “extraordinary circumstances” never fall into the categories of private, family, or professional matters, otherwise the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center would’ve violated his own ethical standards by outing someone who potentially had circumstances of the sort; and, being that he’s the President of an ethical thing, the...</span></a></div>
