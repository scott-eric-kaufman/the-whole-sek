<p>Boy.&nbsp; Howdy.</p>

<p>These first drafts floored me.&nbsp; While still suffering from many of the problems that all young literary journalists must overcome, these first drafts are far suprior to any first drafts past students have produced.&nbsp; Not only that, some of these first drafts are better than many of the final drafts past students have produced.&nbsp; In the past, I've had first drafts due in Week 7, the thought being that the more revisions the better.&nbsp; But there's a trade-off: because the students already writing in Weeks 5, 6 and 7, they're not paying as much attention to the assigned reading as they otherwise might.&nbsp; (I suspect that, up-swept in the rush to produce their first drafts, they may do very little of the assigned reading.)&nbsp; This quarter, they focused on reading, analyzing and discussing articles until Week 8 and what I've discovered is this: those 4 or 5 extra weeks of dedicated reading make all the difference in the world.&nbsp; These students are impressively intuitive because, technically speaking, they fucking get it. </p>

<p>Why then do you suppose that so many undergraduate papers for literature classes are so patently awful?&nbsp; The commonplace complaint of English professors--the students don't read criticism and therefore don't know how to produce it--always rings hollow.&nbsp; The Balkanization of the profession ensures that even a student well-versed in criticism is unlikely to produce what a particular professor considers a competent critical analysis.&nbsp; What these students need is some way to read hundreds of superior student essays, to mine them not for ideas--that's plagiarism, and plagiarism, as we all know, is the devil's third favorite past-time after putting idle hands to use and masturbation--but for proficiency.&nbsp; English undergraduates write terrible papers because they don't fucking get it.&nbsp; They can't because they're never exposed to what good undergraduate English essays look like; or they know what an abstract model of a good undergraduate English essay looks like but have never seen or produced one themselves.&nbsp; So why not provide students throughout the quarter with examples of excellent essays.&nbsp; Start a farm for superior essays on <em>Huck Finn</em>, teach the essays alongside the book, then write a prompt that makes it impossible for the students to plagiarize any of the essays you've provided (or encourage them to learn about citation and allow them citational privileges).&nbsp; Maybe then they'll fucking get it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>[Note: I intended this to turn into an amusing diatribe in favor of plagiarism--packed to perfection with slips down slopes dewy with rubbing alcohol into pits lined with razors--but actually convinced myself that this might not be an entirely untenable idea.&nbsp; How's about them apples?]</p>

		<span id="comment-6121231-content"><p>I think you&#39;ve hit the nail on the head; undergraduates in most classes are being graded for producing an artificial genre - the undergraduate paper.  This genre is still very much a product of 1950s New Criticism - i.e., close reading with thin or non-existent historical research and little awareness of the critical debates going on in the present time.  It doesn&#39;t correspond to what professors as scholars actually produce in their own published work, which is why most graduate students have to re-learn how to write in their first semester.  My solution when I was teaching 28A,B,C was eventually just to pass around sample passages from student papers and discuss what analytical techniques work, which ones don&#39;t, etc.  But it would be far better to have compilations of polished papers.</p></span>

Anecdote ahoy! A few years ago I was a TA for first year sociology at a reasonably prestigious English university, I set up a website for my students with hints, tips and reading suggestions.  I also included a (middling) essay of mine from when I did a similar course as an undergraduate along with comments as to its strengths and weaknesses.  The URL to this website I gave to my students on the introductory material I handed out to them.  It was not linked from anywhere else and not Googlible.  You can guess how this ends.  Recently, doing a vanity search on Google, I find that a number of cheat sites are willing to sell my own essay back to me.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6157696-content"><p>I recently returned to school after a long hiatus and completed my English B.A.  The professor for my capstone course thoughtfully included several student essays from previous classes in the course packet, and I can&#39;t understate how grateful I was for those model essays.  The essays gave me a concrete sense of what kind of work was possible and, more importantly, what kind of work was acceptable.  This probably kept my anxiety to a minimum, too -- I remember reading the model essays and thinking, &quot;I can do better than that.&quot;</p>

<p>I suppose the model essays weren&#39;t generally helpful in this case, though.  I spoke to my professor at the end of the semester, and he didn&#39;t even try to conceal his disappointment with most of the work the class had turned in.  But the conversation then turned to his impending retirement, and that cheered him up right away.<br />

Cephalous-Style, Like Hamster, Only Tougher...)</strong> [Cross-posted over yonder.] Many, many, many people linked to the article in The Chronicle of Higher Education on “Academic Flame Wars.” To my mind, Miriam hits the nail on the head when she says “It’s not clear what we’re supposed to learn from this article. That people are sometimes nasty to each other in online environments? That discussion groups aren’t necessarily warm and cuddly? That spending time online can distract you from other pursuits? I could have sworn that most of us knew these things already.” As a description of the way people relate online, Mr. Mendelsohn’s account is as accurate as any. For those impressed by its profundities, well, you and I should have words about the sky (still up), the seas (still water), food (still edible) and television (still unbearable).* For the rest of you, the real issue in this article is accountability. The first thing you notice when reading it is that its pseudonymous author, Alan Mendelsohn, appears to have played no part in the various skirmishes he describes. He’s an innocent bystander in a violent, hostile (and presumably unmoderated) forum. Perhaps Mr. Mendelsohn really did stand on the sidelines and watch as his department-mates tore into each other. In his account, at least, he isn’t a major player. He’s no tire-iron wieldin’ “Brian” who, “in a bizarre performance...vaulted into the discussion to announce that Dave was ‘the boy who cried racism.’” As the final paragraph makes perfectly clear, he’d like his audience to believe he’s the one who “plaintively” asks “Am I the only who that has papers to write?” (I don’t buy that someone would be moved, at least “a year later,” to write an anonymous column in The Chronicle if he hadn’t a stake in the affair.) He’d participate in these discussions, he’d have us believe, but he’s too busy drafting a criticism of a theoretical trend that you’re bored with the essay by the time it appears in a peer-reviewed journal, but at least you’ve produced something more lasting than a blog-delivered, “You think you’re so sympathetic to the oppressed, Dr. New Historicist, but when it comes to labor activism in the community, you’re a no-show.&quot; I’m circling back to that. When he conflates an official departmental listserv and a blog--&quot;my department’s online discussion group for graduate students, which often doubled as a blog in that students made six- or seven-paragraph comments about various topics&quot;--he makes a category error that his brief mention of McLuhan should’ve warned him away from: different media, different ball-game. An official departmental listserv, comprised of people you meet and interact with on a regular basis, and in which matters are discussed serially but in such a way that previous bits of the conversation are lost in the noise that follow, well, that’s entirely different from a blog in which everyone’s words are right painfully present. They make themselves known by virtue of their permanence. To misconstrue someone’s point is to risk being called out for misconstruing it because...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/i40_millisecond.html"><span><strong>40 Milliseconds, Featuring Former Leading &quot;Lady&quot; Luke Perry as Dread Pirate Linguist Dr. A. Cephalous</strong> Irrenowned linguist A. Cephalous loves his obsolete adjectives and anarthrous occupational nominal premodifiers. However, he loves thinking about the blazing speed with which humans produce intelligible language even more. So how pleased is he to learn that Dutch linguist Peter Hagoort won the 2005 Spinoza prize, a.k.a. the &quot;Dutch Nobels,&quot; for his work on neurobiological aspects of human linguistic competence? Very. Hagoort demonstrated that &quot;people know the grammatical data about a noun approximately 40 milliseconds earlier than they [utter] the first syllable of a word.&quot; (With 40 milliseconds being such a frickin' long time, it's no coincidence that Hagoort works at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.) According to Hagoort's 1998 article in Science, This knowledge includes information about the meaning of words, their syntactic properties (such as word class), and their phonological properties (such as their phonemes and syllable structure). All this information is stored in a component of long-term memory that is usually referred to as the mental lexicon. During speaking, the mental lexicon is accessed automatically at very high speed to select words that express the intended meaning, and to retrieve their syntactic and phonological properties....A central unresolved question concerns the orchestration in real time of the retrieval of the distinct types of linguistic knowledge required to produce fluent speech. The answer, as I've already mentioned, is about 40 milliseconds. And that's for speaking. How quickly is it for writing? The fellows at the A. Cephalous Center for the Unscientific Study of Scientific Science Stuff decided to find out. One of the fellows, Sneed, scientifically imbibed 3 gallons of water. Another, Tommy, scientifically steered Sneed's hand into a gallon of water warmed, scientifically, to room temperature. Lady lab assistant Marsha measured how long it took before Sneed's sallow face performed the familiar contortions of persons seconds away from mighty micturations. At this point the lab director, A. Cephalous himself, asked Sneed to remove his hand from the warm water and compelled him to confess to murdering by snickersnee the beloved office caricature, The Insolent Sailor, and informed him that he must also, scientifically, measure the speed with which he selected the appropriate words and retrieved their syntactic and phonological properties. The obliging Sneed--held captive by his busting bladder and the snickle A. Cephalous had slipped around his neck whilst removing his warm-watered hand--confessed to his morally dubious dastardly doings and begged to be unsnickled and unsnooled so that he might relieve the painful pressure of his bloated bladder. A. Cephalous declined Sneed's request. Snarling at his snickering former fellows, the snickled Sneed labored a lunge at his former fellows and much to mutual dismay nearly snapped his snickle. The snickle held but sad snarling Sneed's snooled neck did snap. His snobbish former fellows, saddened by the snapping of Sneed's snickled neck, quickly tired of disposing his detritus and decided to dedicate the day's remaining light to snuggling and snogging. Those few fellows without women with whom snuggling and snogging would be constant and consensual were to retire...</span></a></div>
