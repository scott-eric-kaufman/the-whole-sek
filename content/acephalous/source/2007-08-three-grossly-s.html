		<span id="comment-78666938-content"><p>I did go to LSU, but not to play baseball.  My last year in Legion was my last year in organized ball.  Mike was also three years younger than me -- if I&#39;m remembering right, he played Varsity for Kentwood from his freshmen year forward.  </p>

<p>Also, I should add a note: playing with someone who&#39;s great says absolutely nothing about one&#39;s own skills.  I was an all-field, hit-behind-the-pitcher-type player.  Once my knees started barking and my range dropped, I moved from short to third, and there&#39;s no such thing as an all-field third baseman, so that was it for my playing days.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-78734946-content"><p>This post totally screwed my day, as it provoked me to spend several hours, in my damned office, googling all the guys that I played with back in the day to see what became of them, when I should have been working. I really already knew, of course, what became of them as players... </p>

<p>So strange to find the guy who was probably one of the best LLers in the US back when we were 12 (would have f&#39;d Drury up right good - seriously) is now a Dental Insurance Analyst. A few inches taller and everything would have been different. Or the guy who made it to AAA with the Yankees is now a cop back in his home town. Or maybe it&#39;s only strange to me. It&#39;s a perfectly normal chain of events, I suppose.</p>

<p>I found a photo collection of a bunch of the best of my LL / legion (but not HS) teammates - the ones who went Div I - playing wiffle ball this summer in someone&#39;s backyard. It was a <i>memorial</i> wiffle-ball game, in memory of one of my other teammates who drunkenly fell off of a roof and died during college. They have gotten, in some cases, very very fat. But when they bat, you can recognize the stance from when they were 12 - 15 - 18 years old. </p>

<p>The guy they were commemorating charged the mound on me when I was 15 and he was 14. But when he got out to me, and I dropped my glove, he didn&#39;t really know what to do next, and so that was that. My dad had cut him from the 15 yr old all-star team the day before...</p>

<p>They are townies, then. They went home after college. And back then, they had what we thought of as &quot;hot girlfriends&quot; who&#39;d sit in the stands, game after game, and it seems that some of them have married them... The girlfriends, now wives, look tired and old. They look tired and old. Academia shaves the years off, somehow. My wife and I look ten years younger than the lot of them. </p>

<p>(Anyway, this has been a slight, momentary, midlife crisis. Thanks for hosting, Scott...) <br />

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/making-jokes-du.html"><span><strong>Making Jokes During Pain, Plus Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Leonard Cohen</strong> Since y'all have seen fit to make jokes during my pain* I'm not going to post anything original tonight. Not even anything humorously frivolous. Instead, I'll post Ladies and Gentleman, Mr. Leonard Cohen (1965). Despite being made by Canadians, it's quite good. Even if you don't like Cohen, I recommend watching the stand-up bit at the beginning of the first episode. At the very least, his delivery bears on Saturday's post. Cohen could, in fact, not sound like Cohen, meaning that his decision to read and sing flat may not be reducible to his deficient voice. Judge for yourself: Before Joe panics because I've become one of those sad &quot;YouTube bloggers,&quot; let me say that this documentary's been lost for more than a decade, so its appearance on YouTube's a certifiable find. This is no cute polar bear cub, but a verifiable important bit of music history. Or something. Anyhow, watch Part One above. Now that I've quelled that fear, here's the rest of the documentary: Part Two: Part Three: Part Four: Part Five: Tomorrow, I'll write about more academic material, i.e. elephants that aren't on tables, kittens that aren't around corners, and rings that aren't on fingers. *Joss Whedon, &quot;Hush,&quot; from Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season Four.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/the-self-correc.html"><span><strong>The Self-Correcting Blogosphere</strong> Two days ago, I told a story about having to have a toilet seat removed from my head by the jaws of life. I mentioned that the people who removed it knew my father, because he was also on the rescue squad. Two days later, the mysterious &quot;alkau&quot; fleshed out my story. Since this happened in Alberta, these firefighters didn't know my father. He was only a paramedic when we lived in New Jersey. I thought this happened in New Jersey. I must've been confusing this with the time the firefighters were called to my parents' house [eight] days after I was born ... when my dad was on call. Can you imagine that? There you are, playing cards with the other paramedics, and a call squawks in: &quot;Fire reported at [your address].&quot; I wasn't even a week old before my knack for getting myself into &quot;situations&quot; outed itself. Back to the topic at hand: I didn't lie when I implied this happened in New Jersey. Nor did the mysterious &quot;alkau&quot; lie when she said my head had been extricated by the jaws-of-life. But, as the equally mysterious &quot;jlkau&quot; informs us, she was mistaken. Seems trained rescue personnel would not use something with &quot;an incredible 195,126 lbs. of cutting force&quot; anywhere near the head of a small child unless he were trapped in the crushed hulk of a burning vehicle. This blog is now made of truth.</span></a></div>
