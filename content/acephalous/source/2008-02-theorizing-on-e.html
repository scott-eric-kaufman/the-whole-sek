If it is of use to men, why should not natural selection have multiplied the few women who have it? Why are not men eight or ten feet high, and as strong as elephants; would it not be useful to them?

<p><em>Actually, this essay is the protoplasmic first ancestor of the Just-So evolutionary sociobiology essay. </em></p>

<p>I&#39;m digging through the archives for appropriately clever introductory paragraphs (SUCH IS DAMNABLE REVISION!) and have found so many refutations of Darwin that dovetail with the just-so crowd it ain&#39;t even funny.</p>

<p>Scrumptious,</p>

<p>I like bananas (and, when 13, wanted to be Mike Seaver) much as the next guy, but ... I&#39;ve said too much, haven&#39;t I?</p>

<p>Adam,</p>

<p><em>Dude, I am. At least on my right-hand side. </em></p>

<p>You&#39;re 10 ft. tall on your right hand side?  I&#39;m about 6&#39;1 on that side, and, I think, about 6&#39;1 on the other.  You variably-heighted Brits are weird.</p>

<p>Ari,</p>

<p>Fly!  Fly!  You are free now!</p>

<p>Ahistoricality,</p>

<p>You beat me to that punch.  If I&#39;d wanted to be more funny than accurate, I&#39;d have slotted that graph in last, since that sentence is a monster of Morrisseyian proportions.</p>

<p>Daniel,</p>

<p><em>I can&#39;t count the number of times I&#39;ve wished I had a race of flying squirrels.</em></p>

<p>Have you checked out my catalogue yet?  You too can have a race of (headless) flying squirrels!  (Sorry, but gimmick requires, you know, my gimmick.)</p></span>

On the counter are bottles Bruichladdich, Glenmorangie, Gran Patrón Platinum, Johnnie Walker Blue, Chopin, Neisson Reserve, and Grey Goose. More bottles are on the floor. The UNDERGRAD explains his situation to the CASHIER: Undergrad: No dawg, you don't get it. Them bottles wasn't for drinking. They were behind the bar, yo, to impress the ladies. But we served them shit. Cashier: So you wanted your bar to look stocked and— Undergrad: Now you feelin' me, dawg. (thumps chest and points at CASHIER) So yo, see, we put all this shit on our plastic and now we need to return it. We had to impress, yo, so— (points at bottles). Cashier: And now you want to return them? Undergrad: Yup. (into phone) No man, dude says we cool. (to CASHIER) We cool right? Cashier: Long as they're not open— Undergrad: Not open? Hold on now. (into phone) Says they need be not opened. (listens) That's what he say. (still listening) Hold on. Let me gets clarifyification. (to CASHIER) So now you saying these need be not opened? (CASHIER nods) That's not what we just now agreed on when you said we cool. Now you say we not? (into phone) Now he say we not cool. (listens) That's what he say. (listens) No, dude, now we not cool. (listens) Shit, hold on, I'll explain. (to CASHIER) So you know we had, see, you know we had to make it seems like we wasn't just stocked for the party. (CASHIER nods) Had to make seem like we always rolling, so my boy (points at phone) underscrewed some of them tops and corks and shit. But nobody drank none. (loud tinny sounds from phone) Cashier: (reaches for a box of Johnnie Walker Black) So you just unscrewed this is what you're saying? Undergrad: (into phone) Hold, yo. I got this covered. (to CASHIER) Look, why y'all accusin' us drinking the good shit and refilling them bottles with— Cashier: I didn't accuse you of anything, but now that you mention it, I have an open bottle of Black back here. (brandishes two snifters) I pour some from mine here and some from yours here, they gonna taste the same? Undergrad: What? (into phone) Wants to compare and shit. (in the parking lot someone lays into their horn) What? (car horn continues) Can't hear shit. (car horn continues) Come again? (to CASHIER) Can't hear my boy. (turns and begins to walk toward door) Hold on, yo. Be right back. (exits) SEK and CASHIER exchange looks. The car horn ceases. A car door slams and another car—perhaps the same, but perhaps not—peels out of the parking lot. SEK and CASHIER look at the bottles left behind. Cashier: Think the little shit would've won my Pepsi challenge? SEK: Doubtful.</span></a></div>

I don't believe the Christmas Truce really happened. Nor do I believe the guy who purchased the letter claiming otherwise is the same Chris de Burgh whose song &quot;Say Goodbye To It All&quot; [.mp3] haunted my childhood. (I don't recommend you listen to that song. It's beyond awful. My rebellion was so pathetic as to barely register as rebellious.) I am not this handsomely-named guy writing at HNN. I haven't written a biography of Rosalynn Carter, nor do I know whether Carter's experience in the White House is in any way analogous to Hillary Clinton's. However, I do agree with my namesake on one front: Clinton's accomplishments in seven years of service approximate what Obama's mustered in a mere two, and I think that critically undermines Clinton's claims that her &quot;experience&quot; trumps his. (Not that this'll satisfy Ari.)</span></a></div>
