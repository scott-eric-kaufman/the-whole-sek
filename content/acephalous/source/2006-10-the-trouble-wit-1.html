<p>For Walter Benn Michaels, “culture” is a comforting fiction based on
an unscientific racial logic, an incoherent theory of historical
transmission, and a discredited linguistic essentialism.&nbsp; I’ll leave
the last of those arguments to the experts who will show up later this
week; I’ll address the first two today—albeit obliquely, through a
reading of the Atom Egoyan film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005KCAU/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Next of Kin</em></a>
(1984).&nbsp; Egoyan seems the perfect foil for Michaels’ account of
identity—born in Egypt, raised in Canada, proudly Armenian—and yet,
with the notable exception of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JLR5/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Ararat</em></a>
(2002), his identitarian commitments never drift into uncritical
sentimentality.&nbsp; His obsession with historical and cultural
transmission, his probing of the <em>means</em> by which memories intrude into the present moment, prevent such drift.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
No critic of Egoyan, academic or otherwise, has failed to notice how
“films-within-films populate [his] works, glimpses of guilt or pleasure
captured on tape and then twisted out of shape by a subsequent
perspective.&quot;<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/10/the_trouble_wit_1.html#1"><span style="font-size: 0.9em;"><sup>[1]</sup></span></a>&nbsp; Nor should they.&nbsp; Egoyan directed the only watchable short in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006FXQN/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Beckett on Film</em></a> (2003) collection; his unostentatious <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0802150551/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Krapp’s Last Tape</em></a>
showcases his preoccupation with inaccurate, illegitimate transmission
of racial/cultural/historical memories.&nbsp; Like Beckett in <em>Krapp’s Last Tape</em>,
Egoyan typically stages the interaction of individual and mechanical
memory as a conflict between an event, the cherished memory of it, an
initial reencounter with that memory, then all the subsequent ones. 
All these “reencounters” are mediated—Krapp’s by his tape-recorder,
Egoyan’s characters’ through home-movies (their own and others)—by
contraptions far less abstract and direct than the “ghosts of
historicism” Michaels discusses in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691118728/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Shape of Signifier</em></a>: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>From Sethe’s standpoint, [Denver’s claim that “nothing
ever dies&quot;] is, of course, a kind of threat; she and her contemporaries
are, as one critic has put it, “haunted by memories they seek to
avoid.” But if <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452280621/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Beloved</em></a>‘s
characters want to forget something that happened to them, its
readers—&quot;black people,” “white people,” Morrison herself—are to
supposed to remember something that didn’t happen to them ... For
Morrison’s race ... provides the mechanism as well as the meaning of
the conversion of history into memory.&nbsp; [Greg Bear’s] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743444965/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Blood Music</em></a> requires <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Music">weird science</a> to explain how people can “remember stuff” they haven’t “even lived through” (197) ... <em>Beloved</em> needs only race.<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/10/the_trouble_wit_1.html#2"><span style="font-size: 0.9em;"><sup>[2]</sup></span></a></p></blockquote>

				<p>I quote from the “Historicism” chapter of <em>The Shape of the Signifier</em> not only because redacted chunks of it appear in <em>The Trouble With Diversity</em>,
but because I think his argument against the possibility of
cultural/racial/historical transmission far more forceful in the
original.&nbsp; This detour allows me to establish a memorial hierarchy,
from the fantastic-technological (<em>Blood Music</em>) to the just plain technological (<em>Krapp’s Last Tape</em>) to the just plain fantastic (<em>Beloved</em>). 
A self-aware lymphatic system capable of cloning consciousness would be
the perfect vehicle for transmitting historical knowledge; modern day
recording equipment would be orders of magnitude worse; and while
powerful, the supernatural reappearance of dead children <del>would be</del> <em>is</em>
impossible.&nbsp; Yet, as Michaels argues, because of its emotional
resonance, most Americans employ this impossibility whenever they think
about culture, which “is now being used as a virtual synonym for <em>racial identity</em>.&quot;<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/10/the_trouble_wit_1.html#3"><span style="font-size: 0.9em;"><sup>[3]</sup></span></a>
</p>
<p>
To return to Egoyan: in <em>Next of Kin</em>, the bored, affectless
Peter escapes the Canadian suburbs by posing as the long-lost son of a
Toronto-area Armenian family, the Deryans, who had been put up for
adoption twenty years earlier.&nbsp; He learns of their situation by
impersonating his therapist and charming his way past a temp into the
room where the videotaped sessions are stored.&nbsp; Watching the Deryan
family—father George, mother Sonya and daughter Azah—arguing, he thinks
about his own family life, his parents’ constant quarreling over his
future, and decides to transform himself into Bedros, the child whose
absence threatens to tear the Deryan family apart.&nbsp; He’ll become both
Armenian and a member of the middle-class.&nbsp; Becoming the latter is easy
enough: he breaks from his family and joins the Deryan’s.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Becoming Armenian, however, offers a greater challenge for the waspy Peter.&nbsp; (I mean, <em>just <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/nok1.jpg">look</a> <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/f003.gif">at him</a>!</em>)&nbsp; And yet, his desire to belong and the Deryan’s desire to accept him are so great that he <em>does</em>,
in some slippery sense, become Armenian by film’s end.&nbsp; Shortly after
arriving in his new “home,” he picks up his sister’s Spanish guitar and
amateurishly plucks at its strings; but as the end credits roll, the
camera pans around her bedroom to beautiful stylings on a Spanish
guitar being played, as we see the second before the screen turns
black, by Peter/Bedros.&nbsp; The impostor <em>acquires</em> what he should have only been able to inherit: that Armenian <em>soul</em>, that supernatural connection to his community figured powerfully in <em>Beloved</em>.&nbsp; (&quot;<em>Just look at him!&nbsp; So <strong>Armenian</strong>, now</em>“)
Now that it happened to “his” people, for example, he’ll also be
haunted by the legacy of the Armenian genocide, &amp;c.&nbsp; It is as if,
to paraphrase Michaels, learning how to rap didn’t make Peter a rapper,
but black.
</p>
<p>Egoyan can create this ambiguity because his attention to the faulty
mechanisms of transmission parries the notion of inviolable identity. 
(Not that that makes Peter’s transformation into Bedros any less
unsettling.) His film captures the very identitarian appeal Michaels’
addresses: the creation, legitimate or no, of a common culture brings
order to the mental lives of its members.&nbsp; However, it also highlights
the sorts of sacrifices such order entails: the acceptance of a lonely
suburban exile into the family and the end to the search for the actual
Bedros.&nbsp; How you feel about this ending—whether you believe it the
celebration of a talented fraud or a statement of intense desire for
communities organized around a racialized culture—bears on how you’ll
feel about Michaels’ argument.&nbsp; What is the <em>ideal</em>
outcome here?&nbsp; Is it better for a community to remain blind to its
constituitive incoherence so long as no one gets hurt?&nbsp; What about if
someone <em>did</em> get hurt?&nbsp; What if the community, by virtue of being a community, suffered?&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
I want to end by veering away from the questions of authenticity
Egoyan’s dark film manages to ask playfully; instead, I’ll focus on
what I called, in the title to this post, “Egoyan’s crowbar.” As I
argued above, Egoyan’s obsession with the technologies of
cultural/racial/historical transmission alerts him to the
inconsistencies Michaels lays bear in <em>The Trouble With Diversity</em>. 
So do you think, maybe, that this is a question of genre?&nbsp; Does
Egoyan’s realist obsession with verisimilitude—the means of its
creation and reproduction, as well as its limitations—immunize him
against identitarian appeals?&nbsp; Does magic realism like Morrison’s lend
itself to a identitarian notion of community?&nbsp; Do you believe writers
imagine community as such and thus write works of magic realism?&nbsp; Or do
you think they write magic realism and convince themselves that’s how
commuity works?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Yes, I know, incredibly general (and inflammatory) questions; but I
want to open the floor for discussion, and know that few amongst us can
resist the urge to write sweeping dismissals and/or defenses of entire
modes/genres/traditions.

I'll x-post what I write, but I'd prefer you comment on the Valve, as we want to keep the conversation humming. That said, I want to repost what my prelude over here, so those who want some background but don't read the Valve can follow the conversation (if they so desire). So, without further ado: The Trouble With Diversity: A Prelude As a prelude to next week’s discussion of The Trouble With Diversity, I’m providing some links to recent articles by and about Walter Benn Michaels and the conversaions they elicited. I’ll follow those with links to scholarly articles about the two books from which The Trouble With Diversity draws its arguments, Our America: Nativism, Modernism and Pluralism and The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the End of History. Articles by Michaels concerning The Trouble With Diversity: “The Trouble With Diversity,” American Prospect, September 12, 2006 “Class Fictions,” Boston Globe, October 9, 2005 “Diversity’s False Solace,” New York Times, April 11, 2004 “Overrating Diversity,” Huffington Post, September 15, 2006 “Plots Against America: Neoliberalism and Antiracism,” American Literary History 18.2 (2006) [Project Muse] “Autobiography of an Ex-White Man,” Transition 73 (1997) [JSTOR] Commentary on The Trouble With Diversity: “Ideology Instead of Identity,” Jennifer Howard, The Chronicle of Higher Education, September 22, 2006 “Liberty, Equality ...

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/10/the_trouble_wit_2.html"><span><strong>The Trouble With Diversity: Alan Wolfe &amp; With All Due Respect...</strong> [x-posted] Today in Slate, Alan Wolfe writes a classic “with all due respect” review of The Trouble With Diversity: Michaels pictures himself as the tough guy willing to take on the hard issues of class while everyone else opts for warm and fuzzy bromides promising cultural and racial diversity. Indeed, he argues, so prevalent is this superficial desire to bring everyone together that Americans apply ideas of tolerance and acceptance to areas where they do not belong, especially the area of religion. “Only someone who doesn’t believe in any religion can take the view that all religions may plausibly be considered equal and that their differences can be appreciated,” Michaels writes. (I am one of the people he has in mind here.) Like his colleague Stanley Fish, he insists that “if you believe that Jesus is the way and I don’t believe Jesus is the way, one of us must be wrong.” Believers, including nonbelievers, have no choice but to fight it out. Convincing each other is futile; converting each other is our only option. With all due respect, Michaels has no idea what he is talking about. Wolfe continues: He writes about religion without distinguishing between religions. Hence, you would never know that some religions do indeed look for converts, while others actually place barriers in front of those who would join. Nor do all religions assign the same priority to belief as evangelical Christians do; observance, for some, is more important than belief, and so long as a society allows them to keep their strict observance, they can easily live together with others of different convictions. And even those who believe that Jesus is the way have come to accept that others can find God in other ways. Since Nostra Aetate (1965), the Vatican has worked assiduously to recognize the validity of Judaism to Jews, and the great bulk of American evangelicals, for all their talk of witnessing the faith, do not routinely tell their Hindu co-workers that they will burn in hell. In a world in which intermarriage is a fact of life and switching congregations hardly worthy of notice, religious diversity is an inescapable fact, not a logical impossibility. With all due respect, I think Wolfe misses Michaels’ point here. It’s not that believers should “fight it out,” but that their beliefs should have a normative force which flies in the face of religious diversity. As he writes: The point about the Ten Commandments, as Neuhaus reminds us, is that they are commandments: “They are not, as has been said, Ten Suggestions or Ten Significant Moral Insights, to be more or less appreciated according to one’s subjective disposition.” What it means to be a believer in the Ten Commandments is to believe that it is in fact wrong to do the things they enjoin against, and that anybody who does not believe in the Ten Commandments is mistaken, and that anyone who does not follow them is behaving wrongly. (186) As Michaels demonstrates, once these beliefs...</span></a></div>
