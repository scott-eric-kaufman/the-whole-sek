        <meta name="description" content="Dan Riehl’s so cute when he’s being racist: Put directly and too harshly, the tragic reality is that Trayvon Martin got, not only what he deserved, but what he sought, with or without realizing it, on the night of his encounter with George Zimmerman. Less bluntly, thug-life and even wannabe thug-life is not a good life, rarely a long life and never a life that any young man — or woman — of any color or race should want to pursue. Now, I know he’s saying that no person of any “color or race” should want to be a thug, but we all know that Dan Riehl has a long history of cowering in corners: Dan Riehl recently encountered some black people who “were technically thugs.” What did these “technically thug[gish]” black people do? “There was no confrontation,” Riehl informs his readers, but “there were maybe ten or so” of them in the bus, which is about nine or so more than is required to trigger a flight-or-flight response in folks like Riehl. Somehow, he managed to keep it together long enough to hear what these “pretty young, not that big” black “kids” were saying. Re-reading that post, I’m struck by the similarities: a white man’s confronted by “pretty young, not that big” kids who he considers “technically thugs,” but luckily for all involved, “it [by which he means, not insignificantly, the black kids] went on but not really to a level that was so loud, or so confrontational that it needed to be addressed.” The implicit question is, of course, “Addressed by whom?” In the wake of Trayvon Martin’s death, for Dan Riehl the answer is “By the likes of George Zimmerman.” Because Zimmerman’s going to become a folk hero in the style of Bernard Goetz, someone white people call out to in their moment of desperation when a black kid approaches them on a sidewalk, armed with concrete. Or maybe he’ll become an Arthurian figure who will rise again in their hour of greatest need when the kids behind the counter at McDonald’s have tattoos and wear their caps crooked. Or maybe the next time Dan Riehl finds his ass on a bus with some black kids it won’t be so clenched because, like his hero, he’ll be carrying concealed heat. Because maybe next time those kids won’t “get away” with threatening Riehl with their youth and blackness, but will get “not only what [they] deserved, but what [they] sought, with or without realizing it, on the night of [their] encounter with [Dan Riehl].” *Actual quotation from the article: “That’s life in the big city, or just another day in the hood if you prefer, bro. Deal with it.” UPDATE: According to Robert Stacy McCain, &quot;Nobody is saying Trayvon Martin 'deserved it,' and it is astonishing that the Tampa Bay Times would employ a reporter who would write such a dishonest sentence, or editors who would let that lie appear in print.&quot;" />

The evidence all points to Zimmerman becoming increasingly obsessed with the presence of black males at his apartment complex in the months leading up to Trayvon Martin's death. Prior to April 2011, Zimmerman's 911 calls were the work of the neighborhood busybody. For example, he called to report: 12 August 2004: &quot;a male in a green Ford pickup&quot; 20 August 2004: &quot;an open garage door&quot; 27 April 2005: another &quot;open garage door&quot; 17 March 2005: &quot;pothole that is blocking the road&quot; 21 September 2005: &quot;a stray dog&quot; 10 June 2009: &quot;fire alarm going off&quot; 7 September 2009: another &quot;pothole in the road&quot; 22 September 2009: &quot;yellow bike ... doing wheelies&quot; But starting in August of 2011, Zimmerman's calls took on a decidedly different note. He reported: 3 August 2011: &quot;[a] black male last seen wearing a white tank top and black shorts,&quot; who he &quot;believes ... is involved in recent [burglaries]&quot; 6 August 2011: &quot;two black males ... in their teens&quot; 23 September 2011: yet another &quot;open garage door,&quot; but specifies reason for calling is &quot;neighborhood watch [meeting] last night&quot; 1 October 2011: &quot;two black males ... 20 - 30 [years old] in Chevy [possibly] Impala at the gate of the community,&quot; about whom Zimmerman's concerned because he &quot;does not recognize [the subjects] or [vehicle] and is concerned due to recent burglaries&quot; 29 January 2012: children &quot;running and playing in the street&quot; 2 February 2012: &quot;[black male last seen wearing] black leather jacket, black hat, printed PJ pants [who] keeps going to [the same] location&quot; And then on 26 February 2012 he calls about Trayvon Martin. There's a pattern here obvious to anyone without an investment in not seeing it. What began as annoying 911 operators with pointless complaints escalated to notifying the authorities any time he saw a black male he didn't know. The argument that he's not racist and wasn't profiling is based on the fact that he &quot;mentored black children&quot; and &quot;had black friends&quot; and is entirely beside the point, because it presumes that he's an overt and deliberate racist. Those who make it claim victory when they demonstrate that he never wore a white hood or bedecked his body in Nazi ink. I'll grant that that Zimmerman didn't pine for the days of short ropes and sturdy limbs. I'll grant that he didn't dream of goose-stepping down the Champs-Élysées in his dress browns. But I won't grant that race didn't color his judgment when it came to young black men with whom he wasn't personally acquainted. From 3 August 2011 forward he's increasingly -- and almost exclusively -- concerned with unfamiliar black males in his apartment complex. Maybe confirmation bias is more the problem here than racism, but the fact remains that the bias being confirmed is that young black males are suspects until...</span></a></div>
