<p>Thanks.  But for accuracy&#39;s sake, it should be known than I&#39;m <i>Stupid</i> Cretinous Cancer Boy.  (Actaully, since I now care about accuracy, it should be Stupid <i>Formerly</i> Cretinous Cancer Boy.)</p>

<p>Ben,</p>

<p>The wife is quite impressed with your manuscript-reading abilities.  She said neither of the medievalists here could read it, and wondered how you could.  She said you must have read you some manuscripts in your time (or possibly even the particular one she copied, since she said something about it being the only extant one).</p>

<p>Adam,</p>

<p>See, this is why I&#39;ll make such a fine manuscript reader: as a once rabid sci-fi fan, I have a nose for continuity errors...that, and, I wouldn&#39;t have noticed it had you not painted so memorable a picture of his/her running around the ship naked.  (I wanted to ask you about that, but I&#39;ll save it for my more substantial response.)  </p>

<p>Goat-skin was always the wife&#39;s first choice.  I remember the day it arrived.  The UPS man came to the door.  I opened it and he said &quot;I have some goat-skin for Scott Kaufman.&quot;  We looked at each other and both started laughing.  There&#39;s something about sending sheets of goat-skin by air-mail that&#39;s inherently funny.</p>

<p>Stephen,</p>

<p>The Mund is offended you think him capable of such violence.  It was actually Kelly&#39;s 24 lbs. monster who mauled me.  He had escaped mid-Halloween party, I found him and tried to pick him up so he didn&#39;t run into the street, and he flipped.  I have <i>never</i> seen a cat this scared and angry.  I finally had to pin him down and wait for reinforcements.  In the meantime, he did that to both arms.  That cat is <i>huge</i>.  But there&#39;s nothing like coming back to a party covered in cat urine and your own blood.  (Also, I&#39;m absolutely positively going to remember to email the comments on your Bellow chapter when I get home.  I&#39;ve been so spaced this past week. All apologies.)</p></span>

Ah, but you have fallen right into my narrative trap.  Because, of course, this is a <i>first-person narrative</i>, and the narrator is an <i>unreliable</i> narrator, what&#39;s known in the trade as an &#39;if Wolfe can get away with it...&#39; character.  S/he may have put the shirt on, and <i>omitted to say so in the narration</i>.  (And, if I remember aright, there are some discontinuities in the narrative at that point).  Though to be honest, it&#39;s a while since I wrote that book, and I can no longer remember what I was thinking.</p>

<p><i>I wouldn&#39;t have noticed it had you not painted so memorable a picture of his/her running around the ship naked.</i><br />
Memorable picture-painting of naked people running.  Is there a nobler aim in art?</p></span>

<p>Ha!  Actually I happened to notice (on one of the further-away pictures, I think) that the first word looked like &quot;Perle&quot;, and compared what I could make out of the first two lines (gold, princes, pay, dear) to the first two lines of Tolkein&#39;s translation, which I own for reasons which now escape me.  Initial hypothesis pure fortuity.  Without a Modern English text for ideas, I wouldn&#39;t hazard any guesses as to what the words on any given line are.</p></span>

<p>You&#39;re the next Gene Wolfe...by which I mean, at least I can tell your narrator from your other characters.  (Am currently reading <i>Salt</i>...but am high on cold medicine.  So probably have nothing to say about it other than &quot;I like.  It good.&quot;)  That said, I&#39;m still tweaking my drafted post on <i>Stone</i>, which I like more the more I think about.  I think this is the benefit of stuffing a novel so full of ideas as you have, which is something I like.  I think there&#39;s an interesting alteration of the narrative voice when you inform the reader that...nevermind, since I know two other readers have decided to read <i>Stone</i> I won&#39;t reveal this immediately.  (Check your email tomorrow, maybe, or y&#39;all read the damn faster.  I&#39;m crunked on Dayquil and impatient!)  </p>

<p>Stephen, </p>

<p>Oddly, I had taken my helmet off prior to being mauled.  This was a bad idea, as I have a very painful scratch down the side of my scalp which feels like it tears everytime I smile.  Thankfully, I have this terrible cold now and scorn everything on principle.  Also, in my defense, his alternatives were &quot;be held down by this man who can&#39;t bear to see his friend&#39;s cat run away&quot; or &quot;run into the street and be hit by a car.&quot;  He should&#39;ve known better.  (<i>cue Richard Marx.  Wait, no, please don&#39;t</i>.)  And really...he&#39;s a <i>24 lbs. cat</i>, armed with <i>razor sharp teeth and claws</i>.  Why should <i>he</i> be scared of me?  </p>

<p>Ben, </p>

<p>I won&#39;t tell her.  She now has an intense respect for your acumen, and I don&#39;t want to shatter her illusions.  She sometimes thinks that medieval literature matters, and when people like you—<i>i.e.</i> people she doesn&#39;t know to be medievalists—provide evidence that the world still cares about 14th Century manuscripts, she&#39;s a much happier woman.  I can kind of sort of not really still read Middle English.  I had to learn to read it for the &quot;History of the English Language&quot; course I took as an undergraduate (while still a linguistics major), but at this point, well, I&#39;m &quot;rusty.&quot;  I didn&#39;t recognize it at first glance, so I&#39;m still impressed.  </p></span>

When your options are your wife's clothes and a bicycle helmet, well, they're limited. (Pictures available upon request. This post will certainly be deleted before I hit the market.) I should add that I've a reputation for wearing and/or suggesting the most offensive Halloween costumes imaginable. If you don't believe me ... then you don't believe me, since there's a 00.000% I subject my brilliantly offensive costumes on the general public. All apologies in advance, but the odds of this appearing on my permanent record are less than nill. (But they really are brilliant. This year's &quot;costume&quot; represents the bottom of my costumery barrel. Terrible, really. Offensive by sartorial necessity.
