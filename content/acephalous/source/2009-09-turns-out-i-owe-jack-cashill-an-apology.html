<p>&quot;There was a good deal of literary back-scratching going on in Hyde Park,&quot; said writer <strong>Jack Cashill</strong>, who noted that a mutual friend of Barack and Ayers, Rashid Khalidi, thanked Ayers for helping him with his book <em>Resurrecting Empire</em>. Ayers, explained Cashill, &quot;provided an informal editing service for like-minded friends in the neighborhood.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>Your eyes do not deceive you. Against odds of astronomical grandeur, Cashill&#39;s independent, corroborating evidence for his theory that William Ayers wrote the President&#39;s memoir <em>is also named Jack Cashill</em>. But, as Cashill—the one who first made the claim, not the independent researcher who verified it—might say, sometimes the world can be as small as the city of the Chicago.</p>

Andersen says &quot;a Hyde Park neighbor&quot; told him so and I believe him. I just don&#39;t get the sense from the little president man that he could write a book. If he *could* write a book, his career would have been very different early on. He wouldn&#39;t have chosen to scrounge around the slums of Chicago with that hateful marxist preacher if he had actual literary talent or even general literary proclivities I don&#39;t think. I doubt his woman would have married him neither, if he were a writer for real. She doesn&#39;t seem very enthusiastic about thinking and stuff.</p></span>

<p>This is just a nitpick, Scott, but that&#39;s not actually so.  </p>

<p>An &quot;unauthorized&quot; biography simply means that the subject hasn&#39;t given their legal stamp of approval to the book; it doesn&#39;t mean that a subject, or related <i>couldn&#39;t</i> be a source &quot;by definition.&quot;  </p>

<p>As I said, this is a nitpick, but &quot;by definition&quot; is wrong.  (Taking into account that, of course, &quot;not&quot; also fell out of your sentence between &quot;did&quot; and &quot;participate.&quot;)</p>

<p>&quot;Authorized&quot; and &quot;unauthorized&quot; concepts that are applicable legally, but don&#39;t speak to specific details of who may have said what to which author.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s unlikely beyond all reasonable doubt that Michelle Obama was a source here, but it&#39;s not impossible &quot;by definition.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.publaw.com/biography.html" rel="nofollow">Helpful link</a>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to encourage your trolls; as I&#39;ve said, it&#39;s just a tiny nitpick.</p></span>

<p>You got me there, happy.</p>

<p><em>He wouldn&#39;t have chosen to scrounge around the slums of Chicago with that hateful marxist preacher if he had actual literary talent or even general literary proclivities I don&#39;t think.</em></p>

<p>As to the literary proclivities---or, as they&#39;re more accurately known, &quot;pretensions&quot;---we have irrefutable evidence that Obama had them in the form of the poems he published as an undergraduate.  As to the literary talent, well, that depends on what you mean.  If you mean, &quot;the ability to write non-embarrassing poetry,&quot; then I think we can agree on &quot;not so much,&quot; but if you mean, &quot;has an ear for a finely-turned phrase and steals from the right people,&quot; then I&#39;ve got to say you&#39;re in the wrong.  It&#39;s one thing to give good speech (oratorical talent);  another to write good speech (rhetorical talent); and another to recognize and employ speechwriters whose rhetorical talents complement your oratorical ones, and that is, I think, a literary-type talent.  </p>

<p><em>An &quot;unauthorized&quot; biography simply means that the subject hasn&#39;t given their legal stamp of approval to the book; it doesn&#39;t mean that a subject, or related couldn&#39;t be a source &quot;by definition.&quot; </em></p>

<p>I know you&#39;ve worked in publishing, but it was my understanding that the subjects of unauthorized biographies avoid all contact with the authors writing them because even, as it was explained to me, an email telling an author to &quot;GO FUCK YOURSELF!&quot; could be legal grounds for a claim that the biography is authorized.  Obviously, the person who told me was exaggerating, but as she represents some biographers and this was in the course of a conversation about the complex legal relationships my little literary journalists entered into with their subjects, I&#39;m inclined to think there&#39;s something there.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, though, that I don&#39;t quite know what that is: it could be conventional wisdom of the &quot;There There Be Dragons&quot; variety, intended to chop the infinitesimal odds of a lawsuit into ever finer bits, but now I&#39;m interested, damn it.  Let me consult my friend and see what&#39;s what here.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a597fee8970b-content"><p>IANAL, but I&#39;ve editorially worked on more than one biography that was not, in any contractual way, authorized, but in which, nonetheless, the surviving spouse of the subject gave lengthy interviews and provided much information and material to the biographer.  For what it&#39;s worth.  </p>

<p>In other words, a legal heir to a subject of a biography can easily not sign a contract that renders a biography &quot;authorized,&quot; and yet cooperate as much as the heir desires to.  </p>

<p>Doing so enables the heir to avoid putting their implied personal seal of approval on every detail and phrase of a biographer, while still being cooperative.  </p>

<p>&quot;Authorized&quot; tends to lead to unjustified assumptions by many that the subject/heir has established a legal veto right over the content of such a biography, and this will indeed be the case with many &quot;authorized&quot; biographies, but it doesn&#39;t <i>need</i> to be the case, and often it isn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>See, for example, Edmund Morris&#39; authorized biography of Ronald Reagan; it was fully legally &quot;authorized&quot; by Reagan, but no veto power was exercised over what Morris said or included.</p>

<p>But since this sort of thing is often unclear to many readers/reviewers/people, not signing a legal contract that says the publisher can label the book as &quot;authorized&quot; is one way a survivor or subject can both provide some distance and also be helpful, if they choose.  </p>

<p>Thus, &quot;unauthorized&quot; in no way establishes &quot;by definition,&quot; or at all, that a subject or heir hasn&#39;t cooperated.</p>

<p>Though I think I&#39;d bet a nickel or two in this case that, in fact, Michelle Obama was not a source.  I spell my name &quot;Danger.&quot;</p></span>

It&#39;s a wonder to me that Cashill, so far as I know, doesn&#39;t make any reference to what must be the vast literature on  literary influence and stylistic change in any number of major author studies (Joyce or Eliot, for example). Surely this would complicate his silly argument. And doesn&#39;t someone somewhere consider Obama&#39;s book and its style in relation to his undergraduate style? All I find off hand is a NY Times article on Obama&#39;s long history of opposition to nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>You know it was quite common in the 19th-century to claim that ex-Slave narratives could not have been written by the slaves. I also think of Christine de Pizan&#39;s works being ascribed to men in her 15th-century translations into English. Plus ça change...</p>

<p>As for the intellectual acumen of a Princeton and Harvard grad who is not, unlike so many of those folks, a legacy admit...where&#39;d you get your terminal degree, HF?</p>

<p><i>I think you&#39;re conflating marketing savvy and literary talent. </i><br />
Oh wise one, how do you isolate the literariness of any particular piece of writing? Pick up your formalist silverware and commence slicing! Or maybe I should direct you to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?aq=f&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=" rel="nofollow">Richard Ohmann.</a><br />

Which means you have just accused Christopher Andersen of being a plagiarist and a fabulist.  Either that, or you are accusing Cashill of being a liar.  Choose.</p>

<p>Oh.  Conditional and past imperfect are not the same thing.  You can make an argument that what&#39;s being used here is an implied conditional, but <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15337#comment-788940" rel="nofollow">dicentra</a> has a different take.</p>

<p>Farber already dealt with your &quot;unauthorized&quot; gotcha in his own preciously pedantic way, so I&#39;ll only add that Michelle Obama could have been the source the anonymous source was attributing the information to.  Which would make her the source without making her the source, if in fact Andersen trusts the source of the source.</p>

<p>The rest is you attacking the grammar and punctuation of a blog post.  </p>

<p>Cashill&#39;s the only named source.  If, as he claims before an audience ideologically predisposed to believing him, he never spoke to Andersen, that means that Andersen&#39;s a lying about having spoken to Cashill.  You do not read something on the internet and write about it as if it is the product of a dedicated interview.  You do not, as M.G. Lord wrote a few weeks back, &quot;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-ca-barbie30-2009aug30,0,6186928.story" rel="nofollow">try to pawn off someone else&#39;s research as your own</a>,&quot; but that&#39;s exactly what Andersen seems to do.  The back material for chapters <em>five through eight</em> is almost exclusively a list of previously published articles.  Here&#39;s the kicker, though: </p>

<p>Cashill claims Andersen didn&#39;t talk to him, that he must&#39;ve have read something he&#39;d written online---but the words Andersen reports Cashill having &quot;said&quot; <em>don&#39;t appear online</em>.  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22There+was+a+good+deal+of+literary+back-scratching+going+on+in+Hyde+Park,%22&hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hs=wHu&num=100&filter=0" rel="nofollow">See for yourself</a>.  Now, I can&#39;t definitively say where those words came from, only that Cashill&#39;s claim that Andersen must have read that online is demonstrably untrue . . . which, when coupled with his deleriously sloppy bibliographic skills, makes Andersen the most dubious of sources.</p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re Jeff, in which case, Andersen&#39;s sloppiness, reliance on previously published material, as well as his propensity for lying <em>enhances his credibility</em>.  Which is fine as far as standards go, but it does make it abundantly obvious that you&#39;re not motivated by a deep-seated commitment to the truth.</p>

<p>Back to the original point, here&#39;s what Andersen says of the information contained in chapters five through eight:</p>

<blockquote>For these chapters, the author drew on conversations with, <b><em>among others</em></b>, Senator John Kerry, Senator Tom Harkin, Newton Minow, Jeremiah Posedel, Abner Mikva, Senator Mike Jacobs, Larry Walsh, Zarif, Joyce Feuer, Janet Allison, Letitia Baldrige, Wellington Wilson, Coralee Jacobs, Edward Koch, Rick Lazio, the Reverend Alvin Love, Betsy Vandercook, Mary Ann Campbell, and Lowell Jacobs. (309)</blockquote>

<p>He then proceeds to list two pages of previously published sources.  Significantly, <em>none of Cashill&#39;s work is listed there</em>, which when combined with the fact that wha Andersen reports Cashill as having &quot;said,&quot; convinces me that either one or both of them is lying . . . because either one or both of them is lying, but given how irresponsible Andersen is, it&#39;s impossible to tell who.  Given the available evidence---which is suspect, since Andersen even muffs his own index, claiming Cashill appears on 166 instead of 164---Cashill would fall into the incredibly dubious category of &quot;among others,&quot; in which case, Andersen&#39;s intellectual irresponsibility has made it impossible to verify his claims . . . </p>

<p>. . . which, if you&#39;re Jeff, is a good thing because you can&#39;t disprove what&#39;s been deliberately obfuscated.  </p></span>

<p>I went looking for that as well. I&#39;d also like to know who, in that list of sources, could possibly be close enough to Michelle Obama to qualify as a credible rumor-monger (as opposed to the non-credible ones, which journalists are supposed to ignore): I don&#39;t recognize most of the names, and don&#39;t know (or care, generally) enough about the Obama&#39;s private life to even know where to look.</p></span>

<p>It&#39;s gotta be Ed Koch, no?  Wasn&#39;t she tight with John Kerry back in the day?  No, sorry, I&#39;m misremembering: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Harkin" rel="nofollow">Tom Harkin</a> was her confidante, or was it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zarif" rel="nofollow">Zarif</a>?  No, I&#39;m sure it was <a href="http://www.senatedem.ilga.gov/index.php/sen-jacobs-home" rel="nofollow">Mike Jacobs</a>, because he and Michelle were <em>like this</em> back when they didn&#39;t live anywhere near each other and neither were in politics . . . but who am I kidding?</p>

<p>We both know that the confidante was &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22among+others%22" rel="nofollow">among others</a>.&quot;  How could it not be?  By which I mean, I dare you to prove it isn&#39;t.  Because neither you nor anyone else can . . . which is exactly as Andersen wants it.  Honestly, it&#39;s hilarious that Jeff points to a claim in a poorly researched, aggressively irresponsible book by a celebrity biographer and thinks the burden of proof is <em>on us</em>.  (And by &quot;hilarious,&quot; I mean &quot;pathetic,&quot; because he used to be better than that.)</p></span>

Written neither in the Emory Elliot mode—a history of items both literary and American—nor that of Sacvan Bercovitch—a history all items written by Americans that can be yours for the low, low price of $299.29—editors Greil Marcus and Werner Sollors instead decided to write a cultural history of the United States in a self-consciously literary voice. As Laura Miller at Salon* writes, the two have pitched the biggest tent conceivable, pegging each of the chronologically arranged essays in the book to “points in time and imagination where something changed: when a new idea or a new form came into being, when new questions were raised, when what before seemed impossible came to seem necessary or inevitable.” With this in mind, they’ve produced a compendium that is neither reference nor criticism, neither history nor treatise, but a genre-defying, transcendent fusion of them all. It sounds impossible, but the result seems both inevitable and necessary and profoundly welcome, too. This is, then, an anthology seemingly written to drive J.C. Hallman to drink, because it doggedly focuses on cultural significance over the literariness of the literary. However soul-deadening he might consider its subject matter, the manner in which most of it is written would likely meet with approval. Though idea-driven, the prose in Jonathan Lethem’s entry on Thomas Edison—in which he exclusively discusses the inventor’s place in film history—still sings: To watch the Edison films now, and those of the other production companies that joined him in the earliest phase of the film industry, is to discover a portal peering both backward and forward in cultural time. Even the most assiduous film buffs tend to begin with Charlie Chaplin, who appeared as a performer and made his first pictures as a fledgling director in 1914, or D. W. Griffith’s Birth of a Nation a year later. But the films that preceded those are as revelatory for their familiarity as their strangeness. Almost none presents a possibility that will fail to be exfoliated in the great boom to come, nor explores an avenue that runs anywhere but straight from the common cultural trove. A 120-second costumed Punch and Judy show like The Clown and the Alchemist (Edison Company, 1900), with its antic clown assisted in his abuses of the sententious alchemist by the use of stop-motion special effects, forms a lucid bridge between vaudeville and a Jim Carrey movie—The Mask, say. And watching the Selig Polyscope Company’s thirteen-minute 1910 version of The Wizard of Oz provides an uncanny sense of dislocation. Presenting a series of highlight moments derived from the popular stage version (adapted by L. Frank Baum, the novel’s author), the Selig Oz, in scenes of the Tin Man’s oiling, of the tale’s companions skipping arm in arm down a yellow brick road, and of the Wizard’s departure by balloon, seems a precognitive appropriation...</span></a></div>

In sum: You are a liar and a fraud. And I don't give a rat's ass what anyone who respects you may think of me, because I haven't any respect for anyone who would respect a disingenuous lying weasel like you to begin with. Can you do me a favor? Because I can't help but be polite, I even responded to these emails by telling my interlocutor how he could secure the information he needed to launch another baseless attack against me. Why did I tell an intellectually dishonest person how to contact an agent who could put him in touch with the author he believes has information that undermines my argument? Because that's what disingenuous lying weasels do: they provide their critics the means to suss out any truth that begs for sunlight. Don't believe me? You should. I have independent corroboration of my good faith gesture. That evidence of my good faith comes from the very person who would cast me as a world-historical tool should elicit a few cheap chuckles . . . as should the fact that said person attempts to prove my iniquitous nature by publishing a private email in which I wrote the following: [Y]ou don’t even realize that I was trying to help you there, because I’d like to know what Andersen thinks as much as you do. But after the way you’ve maligned me without cause for the past few years, my friends—go figure—don’t want to have a fucking thing to do with you. I can’t ask them to do a favor on your behalf because they’re pre-pissed at me for even engaging with you in uncivil blog commentary. But because I’m not a fucking asshole, I remind you that you did some graduate work with someone who currently works at the same agency that represents Andersen. How do I know this? Because the person in question told me once upon a time. I’m not going to give you my friend’s email address because that’d be pointless—apples to oranges she already has all permutations of your address in a kill file—so I point you in a direction of another agent there that might bear fruit[.] Your eyes do not deceive you: I am being called all manner of awful things for the sin of trying to help a person who wants to discredit me because I'm more interested in the truth than I am winning an argument. I'm actually glad my critic tunneled 'neath the low road and published our private correspondence online because it proves that I'm the sort of person whose friends care about him enough to despise strangers on his behalf is so invested in the truth that he will attempt to help someone who hates him find a way around those friends in order to discover it who should fucking cut back...</span></a></div>
