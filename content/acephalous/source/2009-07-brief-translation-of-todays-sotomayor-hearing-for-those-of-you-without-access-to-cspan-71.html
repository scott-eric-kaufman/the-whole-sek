<blockquote><p>[<em>Because I wasn&#39;t.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong> I like you, by the way, for
whatever that matters. Since I may vote for you that ought to matter to
you. One thing that stood out about your record is that when you look
at the almanac of the federal judiciary, lawyers anonymously rate
judges in terms of temperament. And here’s what they said about you.
She’s a terror on the bench. She’s temperamental, excitable, she seems
angry. She’s overall aggressive, not very judicial. She does not have a
very good temperament. She abuses lawyers. She really lacks judicial
temperament.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Everyone knows you&#39;re a bitch, but I&#39;ll refrain
from agreeing with them for a few more questions to keep up the
appearance of impartiality.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong> Are you the only one that asks tough questions in oral arguments?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Exactly how long have you been such a bitch?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong> Let’s talk about the wise Latino comment, yet again.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3eTSbC3neA#t=2m45s">Now is you is, or is you ain&#39;t, my constituency</a>?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong> I can’t find the quote, but
I’ll find it here in a moment—the wise Latino quote. I’ve got it: “I
would hope that a wise Latino [<em>sic</em>] woman, with the richness of her experience, would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male.”</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Latino women clearly ain&#39;t my constituency.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>DICK DURBIN (D):</strong> While white victims account for
about one-half of all murder victims, 80 percent of death penalty cases
involve victims who are white. This raises from obvious questions we
have to face on this side of the table. I’m asking you if it raises
questions of justice and fairness on your side of the table.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>I am a white person. You are not. Will you protect white people like me from people like you?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JEFFERSON BEAUREGARD SESSIONS, III (R):</strong> Aren’t you saying there that you expect your background and—and heritage to influence your decision-making?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em><a href="http://postbourgie.com/2009/06/02/conservatives-and-whiteness-continued/#comment-9939">White people have <strong>history</strong>; minorities have <strong>ethnicity</strong></a>. Will you people treat us white folk with the respect our history demands?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JEFFERSON BEAUREGARD SESSIONS, III (R):</strong> When I
present evidence, I expect the judge to hear and see all the evidence
that gets presented. How is it appropriate for a judge ever to say that
they will choose to see some facts and not others?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Do you hold my truths to be self-evident?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JEFFERSON BEAUREGARD SESSIONS, III (R):</strong> Judge, on
the—so philosophy can impact your judging. I think it’s much more
likely to reach full flower if you sit on the Supreme Court, and then
you will—than it will on a lower court where you’re subject to review
by your colleagues in the higher court.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>If I put this cookie on the table and leave the
room, will it still be there when I get back? Because this is my
cookie</em>—<em>my white cookie</em>—<em>and how am I to know you won&#39;t eat my white
cookie when I leave the room and replace it with a brown cookie?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JEFFERSON BEAUREGARD SESSIONS, III (R):</strong> Was the
fact that the New Haven firefighters had been subject to discrimination
one of the facts you chose not to see in this case?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Because I see what you did with their fine white cookies.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JEFFERSON BEAUREGARD SESSIONS, III (R):</strong> Had you
voted with Judge Cabranes, himself of—of—of Puerto Rican ancestry—had
you voted with him, you—you—you could have changed that case.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>You people are always doing that to our cookies.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JEFFERSON BEAUREGARD SESSIONS, III (R):</strong> But do you
think that Frank Ricci and the other firefighters whose claims you
dismissed felt that their arguments and concerns were appropriately
understood and acknowledged by such a short opinion from the court?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Do you even feel bad when despoil the purity of our fine white cookies?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>CHUCK SCHUMER (D):</strong> Now, I’m just going to go to a
group of cases here rather than one individual case. We could go—we
could do this all day long where sympathy, empathy would be on one
side, but you found rule of law on the other side and you sided with
rule of law.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Will you idiots stop worrying about your damn cookies and act like fucking adults already?</em>]</p></blockquote><p>(<em><a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/brief-translation-of-todays-sotomayor-hearing-for-those-of-you-without-access-to-c-span-71/">x-posted</a></em>.)</p>

That said, your brief translation of Durbin&#39;s bit seems unfair and uncharacteristic.  I&#39;d guess a translation of that remark would be more along the lines of &quot;Killing white people has worse consequences than killing non-whites.  That&#39;s weird, right?&quot;  I thought at first that was the joke- like, finally, a D makes a valid point.  But the D making the valid point in this example was Schumer.  Durbin&#39;s a good guy.  (That said, I&#39;m from Illinois, so of course I think my senator is doing a terrific job.)</p></span>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that Durbin&#39;s a good egg (as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/14/AR2009071402879.html" rel="nofollow">the majority of his questions prove</a>), but that question was just damn oddly phrased and I couldn&#39;t, in unfairness, <em>not</em> mock it.  </p>

<p><em>His middle name really is &quot;BEAUREGARD.&quot;</em></p>

<p>True story: a friend of mine convinced me today that his name was &quot;Jefferson Davis Beauregard Sessions, III.&quot;  Oddly enough, the true ain&#39;t that far from that fiction.</p>

<p><em>She sounded patient, like a park ranger explaining geysers to a five year-old. Again.</em></p>

<p>How could she not, what with the deliberate way she learned to speak English deliberately from &quot;children&#39;s books&quot;?</p></span>

[Let me clarify: I don't think they should when people like you are on the bench.] JOHN CORNYN (R): You wrote that the law judges declare is not, quote, “a definitive capital-L Law that would many would like to think exists,” and, quote, “that the public fails to appreciate the importance of indefiniteness in the law.” Can you explain those statements? [The Law is like the Bible: it has always said what I say it said the moment I say it said it.] JOHN CORNYN (R): In a 2001 speech at Berkeley, you wrote that “whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences . . . our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging.” The difference is physiological if it relates to the mechanical, physical, or biochemical functions of the body, as I understand the word. What do you mean by that? [I'm a convenient egalitarian and I'm going to pretend your statement applies to judges on the bench instead of whether we ought to let blind people be fighter pilots .] JOHN CORNYN (R): We’re not talking about pilots. [Enough with the pilots already. If you don't stop addressing the substance of your argument, I won't be able to trick you into saying you believe ridiculous things.] JOHN CORNYN (R): So you stand by the comment or the statement that inherent physiological differences will make a difference in judging? [Why won't you walk into my trap? It says it right there: THIS IS A TRAP. Are you fucking illiterate?] JOHN CORNYN (R): I’m struggling a little bit to understand how your statement about physiological differences could affect the outcome or affect judging and your stated commitment to fidelity to the law as being your sole standard and how any litigant can know where that will end. But let me ask you on another topic. [Fine. If you don't like that trap, I have others.] JOHN CORNYN (R): There was a Washington Post story that said, “The White House scrambled yesterday to assuage worries from liberal groups about Judge Sonia Sotomayor’s scant record on abortion rights.” It goes on to say, “the White House press secretary said the president did not ask Sotomayor specifically about abortion rights during their interview.” If that’s the case, on what basis would White House officials subsequently send a message that abortion rights groups do not need to worry about how you might rule in a challenge to Roe v. Wade? [How exactly would the mainstream liberals in the White House know what a mainstream liberal like yourself believes?] JEFFERSON BEAUREGARD SESSIONS, III (R): I would offer a letter for the record from the National Rifle Association in which they express serious concern about the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor. I would also offer for the record a letter from Mr. Richard Land, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, also...</span></a></div>
