That Jesus fellow gets the press <em>but</em> it turns out Lacan's the <em>real</em> answer.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Don't you <em>dare</em> say it.&nbsp; I know you want to.)&nbsp; &nbsp;Didn't I read a damn big book?&nbsp; &nbsp;Over 1,600 pages of pure pleasure principle.&nbsp; &nbsp;If only I'd written a works cited I'd even be able to tell you what it was!&nbsp; 

</p><blockquote><p>What all this adds up to is a picture of a state of affairs which, though I personally believe it to be at least somewhat accurate, is far removed from Poe’s conception of the world.&nbsp; Or is it?</p></blockquote><p>

A &quot;picture of a state of affairs&quot;?&nbsp; &nbsp;Far too direct.&nbsp; &nbsp;I should've noted its function as a symbol of a representation of a picture of a state of affairs.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then I would've <em>earned</em> the A this essay inexplicably received.&nbsp; &nbsp;(I chalk it up to the Lacan references.&nbsp; &nbsp;And the fact that I'm <em>so</em> very pretty.)&nbsp; &nbsp;But now you're thinkin' to yourself: &quot;Why hasn't Scott made and drawn attention to a pun whose foulness has no rivals?&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Have no fear:

<p>You came up with a title that blows <i>and</i> sucks <i>simultaneously</i>?  My hat is off sir.  It&#39;s off and tipped in your direction, sir</p>

<p>But I have a challenge for the prize of suckiest title ever, which beats yours if only by virtue of the fact that I actually published mine.  Between hard and indeed soft covers.  Admittedly only with a small academic press, and thankfully it&#39;s long been out of print, but nonetheless: there was a time in my life when I thought that it would be a good idea to call a critical study of contemporary Arthuran fantasy <i>Silk and Potatoes</i>.  There&#39;s a reason the book&#39;s called that, but it&#39;s still the suckiest of sucky titles, and makes people go, &#39;huh?&#39; or perhaps &#39;ugh!&#39;  There.  I&#39;ve spoken out at this circle of Suckier Titlers Anonymous.</p>

<p>[PS:  &quot;<i>What do I think I am, German?</i>&quot;  With a name like &#39;Kaufmann&#39;? Surely not.]<br />

		<span id="comment-14312404-content"><p>Adam, not to be too graphic, but I think there&#39;s a precedent on the blow/suck issue.  I&#39;ve said my peace.  Put me in the &quot;huh?&quot; camp on your &quot;Silk and Potatoes.&quot;  It seems dreadful on its face, but I wager there&#39;s a depth to its suckitude my Americanist mind can&#39;t begin to sound.  And I didn&#39;t realize this would turn into a contest.  Have you and josef k. forgotten about &quot;<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/how_not_to_open.html" rel="nofollow">Cyborg Identity and the Destabilization of Epistemological Boundaries in Thomas Pynchon&#39;s V. and Gravity&#39;s Rainbow</a>&quot;?  At least &quot;Silk and Potatoes&quot; and &quot;The Vision Machine on the Road to Damascus&quot; don&#39;t have airs.  <i>I</i> have airs.  So does Mike.  Only not <i>so</i> refined.  (Doesn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t try; but, bless his little heart, he lacked the will to suck 110 percent.  He couldn&#39;t take his suck to the next level.  He left it there, sadly sucking at its current level.  Poor, poor &quot;Tainted Love: Object Cathexis and Ego Identification in Dermot Healy&#39;s A Goat&#39;s Song.&quot;  If Soft Cell and goats can&#39;t cut it, how will you ever learn to suck like the masters?</p>

<p>Noah--to switch from fourth to first with a deafening lurch--I&#39;ll see if I can find the stomach to post a little more about Szalay&#39;s chapter on London.  It blew my mind when I first read it, and it&#39;s the reason I tagged him as my advisor.  It&#39;s just so . . . he nailed it.  I suppose that&#39;s one of the reasons I think Berube&#39;s so level-headed.  He spent his summer in the <a href="http://www.lifetimehockey.com/egg.htm" rel="nofollow">garment district</a>, and knows what it means to work.  I think a lot of academics from academic families feel that they&#39;re entitled to their leisure, that they don&#39;t need to transform their writing and researching into work; and I think that&#39;s why people like Michael (and, I hope, someday myself) will succeed.  We know what it&#39;s like to work so we appreciate what we do now more than someone for whom work-a-day life is something they saw on <i>Roseanne</i>.  Or maybe I&#39;m just a working class snob.  (I am, actually.  But I keep close watch on my lips.  Through a little bourbon in my boilers, however, and I could sink the whole damn fleet.)</p></span>

The others may have bad titles -- but how many of those titles (plus trademark self-deprecation of younger self) have helped to inspire *an entire bad poem*?</p>

<p>Requoted below of course.  And yes, it&#39;s by me: don&#39;t blame this one on Scott.</p>

<p>Youth needs its cyborg identity<br />
tap the fingers, keys, <br />
the mouse runs<br />
each click a heaping of coal<br />
burned, somewhere the ice cap shudders<br />
the CRT glow<br />
imposing on the body <br />
every reality in monochrome</p>

<p>The rockets go up, you see<br />
Are they acts?  What if<br />
if<br />
they never came down?<br />
Hung, sparklelike, webs in air<br />
Is that system?<br />
Does it demand<br />
A fall?</p>

<p>Looking back<br />
(the cyborg runs, headless)<br />
the debris lies there,<br />
smells of gunpowder<br />
in the green-glow<br />
Looking back, tapping,<br />
For one last unfired</p></span>
