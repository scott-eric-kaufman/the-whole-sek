I'm going to make up for that now by doing what I should've done then: I'm going to publish Goldstein's home address. I encourage anyone who thinks he needs to be punished for saying that about them to go to the following address and make your displeasure known: Jeff Goldstein XXXX XXXXXX XX XXXXXXXXX XX XXXXX-XXXX You know what?

I learned that from Alyssa Milano and by God she&#39;s absolutely right about that. She just got married to an unattractive well-connected rich person. So also what I learned is it&#39;s nice to be attractive but it&#39;s more important to be rich and well-connected. I guess maybe her last name isn&#39;t even Milano anymore. I&#39;ll have to check, but everyone involved here needs to ask themselves WWAMD I think.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very disappointed in how cavalier you internet people can be with each others&#39; feelings.</p></span>

<p>Thank you much.  It&#39;d have been even better if TypePad stopped reverting to earlier drafts every time Firefox crashes, but what can you do?  (I can close the TypePad editor when done writing, so Firefox doesn&#39;t reload it automatically whenever it recovers from a crash, that&#39;s what.)</p>

<p><em>I&#39;m very disappointed in how cavalier you internet people can be with each others&#39; feelings.</em></p>

<p>My feelings weren&#39;t hurt, happy.  Far from it: I thought it hilarious that a group of people who are pissed at me on Jeff&#39;s behalf (because of what I wrote him in that email) are making fun of me for having a group of people who are pissed at Jeff on mine.  I mean, the inability to see the irony is precious.  Who could be upset by that?</p>

<p><em>As a former toadying sycophant, I am outraged and disgusted by your brutal put-down of poor Jeff.</em></p>

<p>I am too!  (And will be even more so in the future, when someone links to this post and claims I&#39;d really posted his emails and home address and only redacted it when everyone got mad at me for doing so vile a thing.)</p></span>

Remember when I <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/06/polygraphlevel-scholarship-may-suffice-for-harmless-speculation-about-the-authorship-of-midsummers-n.html" rel="nofollow">proved</a> that if you use Cashill&#39;s definition of &quot;A-level matches,&quot; then the 1967 Illinois Commission on Automation and Technological Progress also co-authored <em>Dreams From My Father</em>?  That was me being a literary expert and stating that, even if it turns out that Ayers did write <em>Dreams From My Father</em>, the evidence Cashill provided doesn&#39;t meet the minimum requirements of any rational evidentiary standard.  For example, 99 percent of the non-place-name words used in <em>Dreams From My Father</em> also appear in the King James Bible, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;d want to accuse King James of having written Obama&#39;s memoir, now would you?</p></span>

<p>So, automatically generated trackbacks are inherently offensive and must be deleted, but vaingloriously barging into the comments with a link to something you&#39;ve written is the stuff of polite society?  Hypocrisy, thy name is Goldstein.</p></span>

In sum: You are a liar and a fraud. And I don't give a rat's ass what anyone who respects you may think of me, because I haven't any respect for anyone who would respect a disingenuous lying weasel like you to begin with. Can you do me a favor? Because I can't help but be polite, I even responded to these emails by telling my interlocutor how he could secure the information he needed to launch another baseless attack against me. Why did I tell an intellectually dishonest person how to contact an agent who could put him in touch with the author he believes has information that undermines my argument? Because that's what disingenuous lying weasels do: they provide their critics the means to suss out any truth that begs for sunlight. Don't believe me? You should. I have independent corroboration of my good faith gesture. That evidence of my good faith comes from the very person who would cast me as a world-historical tool should elicit a few cheap chuckles . . . as should the fact that said person attempts to prove my iniquitous nature by publishing a private email in which I wrote the following: [Y]ou don’t even realize that I was trying to help you there, because I’d like to know what Andersen thinks as much as you do. But after the way you’ve maligned me without cause for the past few years, my friends—go figure—don’t want to have a fucking thing to do with you. I can’t ask them to do a favor on your behalf because they’re pre-pissed at me for even engaging with you in uncivil blog commentary. But because I’m not a fucking asshole, I remind you that you did some graduate work with someone who currently works at the same agency that represents Andersen. How do I know this? Because the person in question told me once upon a time. I’m not going to give you my friend’s email address because that’d be pointless—apples to oranges she already has all permutations of your address in a kill file—so I point you in a direction of another agent there that might bear fruit[.] Your eyes do not deceive you: I am being called all manner of awful things for the sin of trying to help a person who wants to discredit me because I'm more interested in the truth than I am winning an argument. I'm actually glad my critic tunneled 'neath the low road and published our private correspondence online because it proves that I'm the sort of person whose friends care about him enough to despise strangers on his behalf is so invested in the truth that he will attempt to help someone who hates him find a way around those friends in order to discover it who should fucking cut back...</span></a></div>

But as I like this definition by Tom better than mine, I'm running with it instead: Since SEK eventually writes at any given blog I happen to read,* if I start reading, say, The Corner on a regular basis, it is inevitable that one day SEK will be blogging there. Which means that we can—simply by reading conservative blogs—turn the entire wingnut blogosphere in a bastion of literary criticism interested in Darwinian rhetoric, comic books, and dismantling incredibly dumb arguments made by those very same conservatives. Go, Scott, go! *What I will now call SEK'S Law, a variation on Godwin's Law: &quot;As a blog's lifespan grows longer, the probability of SEK becoming a regular contributor approaches 1.&quot;</span></a></div>
