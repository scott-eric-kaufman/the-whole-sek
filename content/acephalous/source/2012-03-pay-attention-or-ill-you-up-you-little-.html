<p>Why does this sentence work?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ellsworth</strong>: I’ll tell you what: I may have fucked my life up flatter than hammered shit, but I stand here before you today beholden to no human cocksucker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My best guess:</p>
<p>The “I’ll tell you what” is conventional enough.&#0160; Only, which convention does it partake of here?&#0160; Is it the quiet, conspiratorial “I’ll tell you what” salesmen whisper when they want to do us a favor and throw in the top coat for an extra $400?&#0160; (They’ll have to run it by their manager.) If it is, the “tell” and “what,” the speech and its content, would be emphasized; the “I” and “you” would sink, unstressed, in order to abnegate responsibility for the fucking “I’m” about to do to “you.” That doesn’t seem to work.</p>
<p>So, how about the one in which the stresses fall drunkenly on the first and third beats?&#0160; “<em>I’ll</em>&#0160;tell&#0160;<em>you</em>&#0160;what” embraces the responsibility for the beating “I” declare, for all to hear, that “I’m” gonna put on “you.” This works much, much better.&#0160; Such statements should, by law or enforced custom, incite terrible violence … only this one doesn’t.</p>
<p>Instead, we’re treated to a somber but forceful self-introspection.&#0160; Ellsworth, we learn, “fucked [his] life up flatter than hammered shit.” Look at mess of alliteration and assonance there.&#0160; We have the&#0160;<em>f</em>&#0160;sounds stumbling in and out of “fucked,” “life” and “flatter.” Notice how the poetic trickery staples the phrase together.&#0160; The&#0160;<em>fə</em>&#0160;occurs in “fucked” and draws “life” and “up” together, almost into a single word (<em>li-fəp</em>), uniting life up with that what’s been fucked.&#0160; You know, life.</p>
<p>The third&#0160;<em>f</em>&#0160;introduces the next sound, what linguists call the “near-open, front unrounded”)&#0160;<em>æ</em>&#0160;which occurs in the word which best describes it: “flat.”&#0160; The&#0160;<em>flæ</em>&#0160;pulls together the alliterative&#0160;<em>f</em>s with the assonant&#0160;<em>æ</em>s.&#0160; (It also flips the&#0160;<em>l</em>&#0160;and&#0160;<em>f</em>&#0160;sounds of “life up,” a mirroring which’ll manifest thematically half a second later.)&#0160; The repetition of the internal&#0160;<em>æ</em>&#0160;does what it describes:&#0160;<em>it hammers</em>.</p>
<p>The&#0160;<em>æ</em>,&#0160;<em>æ</em>,&#0160;<em>æ</em>&#0160;drives home the content of the phrase, too.&#0160; He may have “fucked up [his] life,” but he did so methodically and with force, rendering it “flatter than hammered” … and at this point we expect something worthy of the assonant pounding it just took.&#0160; I’m not sure why we do, since the phrase itself is difficult to imagine: how do you fuck up something flat?&#0160; Begs the question:</p>
<p>How do you fuck it up&#0160;<em>flatter</em>?</p>
<p>The image we have at this point in the sentence is one of drunk declaration; of the man who makes it, we sense that he’s ruined his life through long effort, through the labor evoked by the mention and soundscape of hammering.&#0160; So we expect the object on the anvil, so to speak, will be worthy of the beating it’s taking.&#0160; Something substantial, you know, dull-red and ready for a vicious forging.</p>
<p>Instead, we get “shit.” That’s been “hammered” flat, no less. Suddenly, the entire sentence turns on its head.&#0160; The rugged worker, ruined by his steady toil, turns out to have been hammering&#0160;<em>shit</em>.&#0160; Those forceful&#0160;<em>æ</em>s suddely sound as tinny as the&#0160;<em>i</em>&#0160;in shit.</p>
<p>It’s pound, pound. pound, clank.&#0160; Thud, thud, thud, tick.&#0160; Our brains skip a beat.&#0160; In short, our impression of Ellsworth changes from proud prospector to tedious slattern in the space of a sentence.</p>
<p>When he realizes his mistake, he pulls back and changes course. “But,” he says, and mouths another, equally conventional, opening statement.&#0160; Unlike the threating “I’ll tell you what,” however, “I stand before you today” belongs to the rhetoric of the public confessional.&#0160; No one stands before anyone, today or any other day, unless they’ve come to repent (or pretend to).&#0160; Realizing the bluster of “I’ll tell you what” has come to naught, he decides to fluff his feathers Protestant-style with a declaration of sins past.</p>
<p>As with all such declarations, this one suggests the current superiority of the speaker to his audience.&#0160; Do&#0160;<em>they</em>&#0160;stand before the crowd, listing their iniquities for strangers to judge?&#0160; No, they don’t.&#0160; They stand there, comfortable, quiet in their sin.&#0160; But the speaker, in high Protestant-style, aims to clear his name.&#0160;&#0160;<em>In public</em>.&#0160; He is no Catholic, absolved in isolation.&#0160; He has a&#0160;<em>direct</em>&#0160;relation to God and a&#0160;<em>firm</em>&#0160;commitment to the community.&#0160; Just like Milton.</p>
<p>Who, incidentally, Ellsworth suddenly channels: “I stand before you today&#0160;<em>beholden to no human cocksucker</em>.” The unnecessary and archaic “beholden” thrusts Milton in your mind, as does the pejoratively adjectival “human.” This “human” reeks of “mere.” God will judge him, it suggests, not some&#0160;<em>human</em>&#0160;authority. Given the implicit insult of “human,” then, we expect something exalted, like “authorty,” to follow.&#0160; Instead, we’re treated to “cocksucker.”</p>
<p>The dissonance is jarring.&#0160; We may not think it consciously, but somewhere, our brains know “cocksucker” ain’t sufficiently exalted to be diminished so.&#0160; We wonder what, exactly, is lower than a “<em>human</em>&#0160;cocksucker.” We imagine the angelic host on its knees, The Great Chain of Being collapsing before our eyes.&#0160; Links collide with unlike links and ungodly things starting slouching, waiting to be born …</p>
<p>… and then we realize:&#0160;<em>This</em>, kids,&#0160;<em>is literature</em>.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

Have—shall we call it fun?) If I begin my essay with a rhetorical question, I contradict the Great French Thinker Montaigne, who believed I should not, because as he wrote, a “mind could not find a firm footing, [therefore he] should not be making essays, but coming to conclusions.” Those conclusions, which were important, are sadly lost to history, but the fact that Montaigne’s name remains reminds those who remember it that his failure was reason enough to memorialize it. My professor said that we should not write in the style of Montaigne, presumably because the stench of his insufficient success might sour my prose, but I believe the best essays are the ones that I write, and if my Professor thinks differently, he can take it up with Montaigne. First, my professor told me to write a paragraph like a hamburger. Can you believe that? That is not a rhetorical question: my college professor told me that the best paragraphs are structured like a hamburger. But I must follow my muse, Montaigne, and insist that I am not interesting in stabilizing my subject, however slight, in a structure of such déclassé fare, or that if I were, mine would tower above that base alternative in direct proportion to the extent of my genius. My paragraphs will, instead, inform my audience about the manner of their composition, paying special attention not to structure or transitions but to the brilliance that I mustered to tame into interest material others might find trite. By “others,” I refer explicitly to my Professor, whose ability to mix a metaphor is nearly as impressive as his encyclopedic knowledge of all things which will never make him money. He claims that an essay is like the relationship he’s clearly never had: it begin with a witty conversation, an introduction, if you will, in which impress upon your reader the timeliness and worthiness of your subject. For those who fail to recognize the universal validity of Foucault, this could be an issue, but Montaigne and I know that so long as we only speak engagingly about ourselves and Foucault, the right kind of people will recognize our brilliance and gravitate to the empty table we have saved for them. My professor then proceeds to argue that the remaining paragraphs in an essay constitute an evolving relationship between the writer and reader not unlike the one initiated in the introduction. “Just as a relationship explodes with initial insight in those first heady weeks,” he says, “so too should a first paragraph make good on the promise of its introduction.” Which is simply wrong — the purpose of an introduction is convince your future reader or paramour that...</span></a></div>

For a thousand years, Our Republic stood as the crowning achievement of civilized beings. But there were those who would set us against one another, and we took arms to defend of way of life against the Democrats. In doing so, we never suspected that the greatest threat came from within. The Democrat Party, and some within our own Senate, had conspired to create the shadow of racial animus using one of their own as the enemy’s leader. They had hoped to grind the Our Grand Republic into ruin. But the hatred in their hearts could not be hidden forever. As last, there came a day when our enemies showed their true natures. The Democrat Party hoped to unleash their destructive power against the Our Republic by assassinating the head of shadow government – Breitbart – and acquiring control of the reserve forces But the aims of the would-be tyrants were valiantly opposed by those without elitist, dangerous powers, who never went to school. Our loyal know-nothing troopers contained the insurrection within the Jefferson Memorial and quelled uprisings across the planet. The remaining Democrat conspirators will be hunted down and defeated. Any collaborators will suffer the same fate. These have been trying times, but we have passed the test. The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger. The war is over. The Sepratist Democrats have been defeated, and the Decmocrat rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning. In order to ensure the security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Global Empire, for a safe and secure society, which I assure you will last for 10,000 years. An Empire that will be continue to be ruled by this august body and a sovereign ruler chosen for life. An Empire ruled by the majority, ruled by a New Constitution. By bringing the entire galaxy under one law, one language, and the enlightened guidance of one individual, the corruption that plagued the Republic in its later years will never take root. Regional governors will eliminate the bureaucracy that allowed the Democract movement to grow unchecked. A strong and growing military will ensure the rule of law. Under the Empire’s New Order, our most cherished beliefs will be safeguarded. We will defend our ideals by force of arms. We will give no ground to our enemies and we will stand together against attacks from with or without. Let the enemies of the Empire take heed: Those who challenge Imperial resolve will be crushed. We have taken on a task that will be difficult, but the people of the Empire are ready for the challenge. Because of our efforts, the galaxy has traded war for peace and anarchy for stability. Billions of beings now look forward to a secure future. The Empire will grow as more planets feel the...</span></a></div>
