The  look. And the selective withholding that look in order to make the look,  when it finally happens, worth something at the end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps if I had children, that moment would be filled with dread  instead of indicative of lazy scripting; but because I don’t have  children, those shots felt manipulative, as if Nolan realized he’d  failed to develop Cobb organically and needed to find some cheap way to  create immediate sympathy. I confess that I wish I’d seen the film Adam  had instead of the one I did—if only because I’m a Jew in Southern  California and had to pay $32 to see the damn thing—but it seemed to me I  spent three hours waiting for a conclusion I knew was inevitable after  the first, and that I’d been mistreated in this way by a director I  prize for his willingness to embrace nonsense in the midst of tightly  structured films.</p>
<p>The Joker’s orchestration of the murder of Rachel Dawes in <em>The Dark Knight</em> is emblematic. There’s no way a plan that relies so heavily on  incident and accident can be planned, but that’s precisely the point:  the Joker succeeds so long as his plan remains an unfathomable flux of a  mess, and the second the Batman can make sense of it, the film resorts  to <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/01/humans-do-not-run-in-packs-they-form-social-circles-and-erect-strict-hierarchies-but-the-desire-to-live-in-a-pack-is-either.html">dogs and fisticuffs</a>.  But the nonsensical core of his plotting in that film only throws into  relief the problem with scripting a straight film about dreams: he  could have played to his strengths, but instead spent three hours  courting his weaknesses.</p>
<p>Passing over the fact that the film delves into and through the  dreams of five contemporary males and is rated PG-13; that it failed to  conform the very rules established via tedious exposition; that Nolan  chose to name the woman who designed the labyrinths with all the  subtlety of a doctrinaire Freudian; passing over all of <em>that</em>,  the absence of an uncanny, doctrinally Freudian or otherwise, in a film  about nested dreams is a substantial flaw generally, but even more so  with Nolan at its helm. Nolan is a director willing to embrace the  absurd in an otherwise realistic film like <em>The Prestige</em>, but when confronted with an opportunity to do so more fully in <em>Inception</em>, decided that the recesses of the human mind function in a manner orderly enough to con. Even someone as <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/psychoanalysis/">hostile to psychoanalytic theory as I am</a> doubts that communal dreams can be scaled like mountains.</p>
<p>In short, all the problems with the film Adam documents <em>still exist</em> even if the children finally establish an eyeline match with their  father. I’m not claiming that moment can’t be moving, only that for me,  it felt inevitable and unearned.</p>

The scenes with Cobb&#39;s children -- both the backs and the front of their twee little heads -- were a cheap, manipulative stunt, notable primarily for both the transparency and complete ineffectiveness of their lugubriousness.  Oddly enough, a repeated shot of a pair on anonymous-seeming tykes running away from the camera is insufficient to build sympathy or longing with the audience.  YMMV I guess, but it shouldn&#39;t.</p></span>

<p>Now I feel like a dickhead: sorry, Scott, if my post appeared to bait you for childishness.  I didn&#39;t intend to.  And actually, my reaction to the film was pretty similar to yours until the very end (I wondered, indeed, if you&#39;d stuck it until the very end -- you say you &#39;walked out&#39;).  And of course you&#39;re right that on the level of plot the film was predictable and holey.  Doctor Memory (and commentator at my blog) are probably also right -- the implication is in your post too, although you&#39;re too well mannered to bash me on the head with it -- that my becoming a father has turned my critical faculties to mush.  Conceivably so.  I&#39;d say I don&#39;t <i>think</i> it&#39;s that (though I would say that, wouldn&#39;t I).  It wasn&#39;t the kids, really (and the final moment didn&#39;t make me &#39;sympathize with any of the characters&#39;).  It was the <i>look</i>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, well, it may be hard to find any ground on which somebody who is not moved by a work of art can usefully discuss it with someone who is.  You feel it, or you don&#39;t: &#39;right&#39; and &#39;wrong&#39; doesn&#39;t seem the best vocabulary, really: millions of Victorians wept genuine tears when they read the death of Little Nell.  Oscar Wilde thought Little Nell&#39;s death utterly unmoving, and indeed risible.  Who&#39;s right?  I&#39;m tempted to suggest it&#39;s easier to endorse Wilde, here, because normally I&#39;m exactly that kind of ironical, postmodern, keep-emotions-at-arm&#39;s-length repressed Englishman who finds the sight of people weeping vulgar.  Except that: there I was, in that cinema at that time, feeling acutal feelings.  Weird.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t argue with &#39;manipulative&#39;, either: as a description of what Nolan is trying to do in this film, or of Dickens&#39;s mode.  I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s quite as pejorative a term as you suggest, though.  Isn&#39;t cinema generally manipulative?  Don&#39;t we go to these texts in part to <i>be</i> manipulated?</p></span>

I think OK Computer was much better than Hail to the Thief. By that logic alone, must i conclude that the latter isn&#39;t very good at all?  Probably not.  I should, then, have self-sufficient reasons for not liking Hail to the Theif as much as the band&#39;s other work. You may be making both points: 1) that the movie, in and of itself, was not good 2)Its not as good as his other work.  </p>

<p>If 1), then i praise your genius.  You solved a puzzle that by design isn&#39;t meant to be solved, without seeing the film entirely. My god! thats like solving a rubik&#39;s cube thats missing half the squares. </p>

<p>If 2), then as much as you know and may appreciate his work, you&#39;d really like him to make movies the way you would, if you were him...&#39;oh Mr. Nolan, you&#39;re so typaically you. Can&#39;t you prefigure how I think you should make movies? With all that talent, why waste your time with elaborate puzzles?  make me feel something, like the director of all those Meg Ryan movies.&#39;</p>

<p><br />
It seems silly to walk out of a movie becuase it does or doesn&#39;t do what other moveies have already done. Incidientally, i resisted the urge the other day to get up from the dinner table in anager because my wife&#39;s meatloaf was derivative. I realized that if i want meatloaf, on some level, it will taste like meatloaf. </p>

<p>This guy has a way addressing the film without quite as much self-importance. <a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2010/07/the_ultimate_explanation_of_in.html" rel="nofollow">http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2010/07/the_ultimate_explanation_of_in.html</a></p></span>

<p>I agree with or consider valid some of your ciriticisms, SEK, but that&#39;s entirely separate from the tone the discussion, which was what was getting my hackles up.  &quot;I didn&#39;t like it&quot; or &quot;I was dissappointed that this artist didn&#39;t go in a more interesting (to me) direction&quot;* are different kinds of statements from &quot;[the film was] designed to make idiots feel smart.&quot; They are different in about the same way as &quot;Your blog post did not provide me with the guidance I was looking for&quot; is different from &quot;YOUR BLOG IS A LIE!!!&quot; or &quot;my comment about my initial reaction to the film wasn&#39;t what I went with&quot; is different from &quot;my initial reaction was ungenerous and incorrect.&quot;</p>

<p>On formalism, my confusion stemmed from the fact that in visual art, particularly sculpture/3d art, &quot;formalism&quot; means quite literally an emphasis on physical/visual form, rather than on representational meaning.  It makes sense that it would have a different meaning in literary or film studies.</p>

<p>*I&#39;m picturing an analogy here to post-Uncle Tupelo recording, where you were hoping that &quot;Inception&quot; would show Nolan to be Jeff Tweedy, but are afraid that it has revealed him to be Jay Farrar.</p></span>

<p>We&#39;re not sensitive; you&#39;re just an asshole.  Sensitive would mean getting hurt and upset by what you said, which no one was.  Instead, we&#39;re annoyed that you call the author an idiot while sounding like an idiot yourself: your sarcasm is at about a tenth grade level and your analogies look like my cat threw them up.  No one feels offended by what you said except on the level of basic intelligence.</p></span>

I think depicting a &quot;real&quot; dream, a dream as it is actually experienced by a dreamer, is impossible to do in a film; even Lynch struggles with it, and in the end <i>Mulholland Drive</i> feels like a Fuessli painting; an allegory that uses the dream as playground rather than a depiction of the artist&#39;s dream. In the same way, <i>Inception</i> uses the concept of &quot;the dream&quot; in order to generate a narrative, just like <i>Memento</i> used the concept of &quot;short-term memory loss&quot; to generate its own narrative.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0134861b8aa2970c-content"><p>I&#39;ve been on a road trip this entire time, so I&#39;m a bit late to the party here, but have you seen this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chud.com/articles/articles/24477/1/NEVER-WAKE-UP-THE-MEANING-AND-SECRET-OF-INCEPTION/Page1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chud.com/articles/articles/24477/1/NEVER-WAKE-UP-THE-MEANING-AND-SECRET-OF-INCEPTION/Page1.html</a></p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a pretty solid analysis, but could use a little commentary here.  I haven&#39;t read the comments on that site, so I apologize if what I say overlaps with whatever is there.<br />
The end is really a sort of false cliffhanger, presented to thrill audiences who didn&#39;t see it coming, and didn&#39;t want to think about the movie very much.  Really, the elements needed to resolve the &quot;is this a dream or not?&quot; question are totally present within the film.  Long story short, it&#39;s a dream.  The above link makes most of the arguments I was going to make, but leaves out a few tiny things and one big one: the music, which is a really blatant clue.  See: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVkQ0C4qDvM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVkQ0C4qDvM</a></p>

<p>There are two ways you can argue the meaning of it all being a dream, depending on whether you think the logic of the &quot;real life&quot; sequences can be applied to actual real life (not pictured), and that shared dreams are possible, etc.<br />
If you think it can, you end up with what I naturally came to:  the whole thing is some kind of inception for Cobb.  There are some clues for this one, relating to how he interacts with Saito and various people.  I&#39;d argue that they are trying to plant some form of the reverse of the idea he gave to Mal in his head; that he needs to wake up and take reality seriously.  A lot of questions are left unanswered by this approach though, even though I think there are a couple hints that it might be the correct interpretation.</p>

<p>The second interpretation is that the entirety of the &quot;shared dreams&quot; thing isn&#39;t real at all. This is what the above author concludes and it&#39;s a little bit more pleasing, because it allows you to view the entire movie as a metaphor about film making.  By that interpretation, this is Nolan&#39;s 8 1/2, and it&#39;s all about himself.  I&#39;d write but it&#39;s best to just read the above post, as it makes all the worthwhile points.</p>

<p>So anyway, I can&#39;t really say anything to address your rhetorical issues with Inception, but I hope this convinces you that there&#39;s at least a little more going on under the surface of the film than meets the eye.</p>

<p>Re: other dream movies.  I regrettably haven&#39;t seen Mulholland Drive, but my favorite filmic presentation of dreams is in the anime Paprika, which I&#39;m surprised hasn&#39;t been brought up.  Paprika is pretty good about doing what Inception didn&#39;t, and acknowledging the bizarre internal logic of dreams.  Things constantly change when you&#39;re not looking, characters make use of the malleability of dreams for their own advantage, and seem to have no problem accepting the strange twists as reality.  My favorite point (from memory) is where two characters are stuck far away from the action and one is just like &quot;why don&#39;t we take these jet skis?&quot; and points to a billboard advertising jet skis.  Moments later they burst out of a scene depicted in another advertisement aboard powered watercraft.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/07/interinception.html"><span><strong>Inter-Inception</strong> It appears as if my wife and I are the only two people on the face of the planet who hated Inception. She walked out about an hour and change into it—immediately before the tedious exposition that made the rest of the film thuddingly predictable—and I followed shortly thereafter. Spoilers follow under the fold. As soon as the ersatz Ra's Al Ghul from Batman Begins got shot the film screamed its circularity. Once the rules about dying in one dream level were explained, the mechanism of that circularity became obvious, as did the fact that the &quot;cliffhanger&quot; would consist of whether or not Cobb was really in the really real world or just in another dream. Which is pot-logic; by which I mean, the sort of thing you say when you're listening to Floyd in your dorm and everyone has their own bowl and is abusing it. &quot;Man, but what if this was all, like, a dream?&quot; &quot;I know, dude, but what if it's not even a person's? What if we're all, like, in a dog's dream?&quot; &quot;And the moment it wakes up to lick its balls? We like cease to exist?&quot; &quot;That is deep, dude.&quot; &quot;Totally.&quot; It's an infuriatingly stupid conceit, and asking the audience to accept it in order to make a film work is insulting.* I'll admit that film was finely composed: the plot circled back perfectly, i.e. the timing of the van versus the timing at the hotel versus the timing at the fortress and then Limbo. Limbo. What to say about that? The less more likely the better. Instead, I'll just note that psychological complexity in this film was figured like a wedding cake: &quot;depth&quot; literally entailed layers stacked one atop the other, such that the &quot;deeper&quot; one went, the &quot;deeper&quot; one was. Which is deep, dude. But the perfect circularity of the plot had another unintended consequence: the film felt like an exercise in empty formalism. I'm sorry, I misspoke: the film &quot;felt&quot; like nothing, because it generated sympathy for neither the characters nor the corporation at whose behest they toiled. When Nolan did attempt to make viewers care about the characters, he did so in the most grossly manipulative of manners: he killed a wife and quasi-orphaned some children. Only who cared? They weren't people so much as necessary elements of his orderly plotting, without whom he couldn't have knocked over that first domino. &quot;Dominoes&quot; aren't the operative metaphor here, though. Inception was the equivalent of watching a grandmaster play an uninspired game against the village idiot. There's brilliance there, certainly, but it's pointless and wasted. *My personal theory is that no one had the gumption to tell Nolan this because The Dark Knight was the highest grossing film of all time.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/08/creating-critical-distance-or-on-teaching-avatar-the-last-airbender.html"><span><strong>Creating Critical Distance; or, on Teaching Avatar: The Last Airbender</strong> As I noted earlier, I decided to teach an episode of Avatar: The Last Airbender in my &quot;American Manga&quot; class even though only half that title applies. (It's technically &quot;American anime.&quot;) I chose the penultimate episode, &quot;The Ember Island Players,&quot; because it 1) requires almost no knowledge of the series to understand and 2) it performs the show's fraught relation to its Japanese forebears. I'll tackle the first item today, the second tomorrow. Before I continue, I'll add the same caveat I have to all these analyses designed for freshmen-level composition courses: they're designed for freshmen-level composition courses.* I'm attempting to model engaged cultural criticism for students who consider culture something to be passively consumed, i.e. I provide the tools then teach them how to construct a persuasive rhetorical argument.** On with the show: &quot;The Ember Island Players&quot; requires little knowledge of the series because it consists of the main characters watching a play that recapitulates it. All I need to tell the two students who haven't already seen every episode is that the kids are about to go to war with the Fire Nation, and that this play (as the title of the episode indicates) is being produced by a Fire Nation theater troupe. As soon as Sokka—the Zeppo of this crew—discovers the poster, the difference between the kids: And their on-stage equivalents becomes clear: Sokka and his sister, Katara, are being played by adults, and Aang, the titular Airbender, by a woman. The episode is as committed to verisimilitude (or a realistic representation the series' established aesthetic) as the average Elizabethean drama in which the women were portrayed by young boys and the young boys were portrayed by old men. Just as with all theater—and by extension, all animated representations of it—the act of suspending disbelief is a wilfull one, a fact which &quot;The Ember Island Players&quot; takes pains to foreground. To wit: That would be curtain rising in the theater to reveal a highly stylized (ahem) representation of the first event in the series: Sokka and Katara on the verge of discovering Aang frozen in a block of ice. Note that the backdrop is clearly attached to a batten (its top is visible even when staring the stage straight on) and that the lighting above is purely functional (intended merely to illuminate the scene in a way that &quot;suggests&quot; the time of day). The stage is framed like a television, calling attention to the unreality of the events depicted on it; but it's framed like a television on a television, which should (but often doesn't) call attention to the unreality of the events depicted on it. (Especially when they're animated.) Director Giancarlo Volpe has created a complex narrative situation that is simple enough for a child to decode. (Which is partly the point of recapitulating the narrative arc of a complex show aimed at children whose memory for nuances may yet be underdeveloped.) Not only is the viewer constantly aware that the on-stage narrative is constructed, Volpe...</span></a></div>
