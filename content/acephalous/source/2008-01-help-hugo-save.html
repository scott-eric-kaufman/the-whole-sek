He cares enough not to insult them directly—they're already fat, after all. What would happen to their self-esteem were Hugo to remind them they're also illiterate? So he kindly hides his concern in the for obese idiots in the header of his blog. When their sagging asses and bulging guts click on his site, they might not see evidence of his concern, but he hopes his message of Phentermine Love penetrates the folds and flaps of flab and communes with the thin person buried deep within.

		<span id="comment-96258008-content"><p>Karl, I don&#39;t think I am.  If George is right and Hugo was hacked, I&#39;ll pull this down.  But as it currently stands, it looks like someone&#39;s exploiting feminist controversy to make a buck.  (And before we think it&#39;s <em>not</em> hacktastic, remember that <a href="http://www.amptoons.com/blog/" rel="nofollow"><em>Alas, a Blog</em></a> eventually admitted to capitalizing on its Online Presence.  I&#39;d rather not think that&#39;s what&#39;s happened, but I can&#39;t be sure.  But if Schwyzer tells me he&#39;s been hacked, I&#39;ll pull this.  I don&#39;t want to tar someone for something s/he can&#39;t control.)</p>

<p>(Plus, when I saw this same invidious code a few months back, I sent Schwyzer an email alerting him to the hack.  He never responded.  Then, when someone linked to him again, I pointed it out, emailed him, and he never responded.  I can&#39;t find the comment I made at <a href="http://www.adamkotsko.com/" rel="nofollow">Adam&#39;s place</a>, but it was a while back, and that was around the third time I contacted him about this.  I can only conclude that 1) he thinks I&#39;m a nobody not worth responding to, 2) he knows he&#39;s right and that I should slink into some corner, or 3) he&#39;s deliberately ignored me for months and months, which proves that I&#39;m envious, and, um, many other things that reflect poorly on me.)</p></span>

<p>It seems extremely unlikely that his blog code was <i>not</i> hacked. In altering WordPress layouts, a blog owner (or her/his blog designer) can sometimes leave certain files universally &quot;writable&quot; (it&#39;s a Unix thing), making them much easier to edit but unfortunately vulnerable to this sort of exploit.</p>

<p>There are many forum/blog posts online about this problem with WordPress.</p>

<p>I first read about the problem <a href="http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/why-i-hate-hackers-right-now/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Google &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=wordpress+spam+injection" rel="nofollow">wordpress spam injection</a>&quot; or &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&newwindow=1&safe=off&q=wordpress.net.in" rel="nofollow">wordpress.net.in</a>&quot; for more discussion.</p>

<p>Note, also, that the links change. I just looked at the html on Schwyzer&#39;s blog again, and found links for anxiety and impotence meds instead of weight loss meds. It&#39;s not hard for a hacker to write code that will dynamically generate such spam links from an external database.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-96275876-content"><p>A Wordpress site of mine got hacked last year after the host managed to hand over a bunch of passwords to some spammers (thanks for nothing, Dreamhost). The spammers as I recall added their bilge to the main index.php file in a way that could be difficult to spot if you were using a standard WP theme (I wasn&#39;t, and it was immediately obvious something was wrong). And it wasn&#39;t enough to edit the file, they&#39;d just keep coming back until you changed your ftp passwords. So let&#39;s just say I&#39;m sympathetic to the hacking theory. </p></span>

Of course I can&#39;t help clicking on something you link to  -- so now I can see that Chris Clarke has been going off on me on his blog.  For some year-old comment that he disliked.  Oh, I can bet that isn&#39;t it, let&#39;s see what a search on &quot;ilyka&quot; turns up: <a href="http://faultline.org/index.php/site/comments/baby_came_back/" rel="nofollow">yep,I&#39;m called a jerk du jour</a> in that one.</p>

<p>If anyone not in Chris&#39; claque wants to actually read my old comment, they can see that Chris misrepresents it; it&#39;s about the presumption that political blogs should be about writing, rather than about organization or even just broadcasting propaganda to an audience, if you want to look at it least sympathetically.  And writers who dismiss organization as &quot;concern with ranking&quot; -- well, envy or cluelessness, it&#39;s your pick.  Chris, you&#39;re blogwarring and being sarcastic, all as you denounce blogwarring and being sarcastic.  Leave me out of it, OK?</p>

<p>Oh, and you know what?  Ilyka doing her best to encourage inter-group hostilities around Gilliard&#39;s death was a classic provocateur move.  I know that you don&#39;t like hearing that, but there it is.  I said that she was acting like a provocateur, and she was.  </p></span>

Pissed me off as stupidly insulting and still does, when I bother to think about it. But generally, when I don&#39;t need an example of that kind of thing, I just consider the source and move on. And I&#39;d just as soon, honestly, not have anything to do with you directly, so I suppose I&#39;ll find other examples of  such things.</p>

<p>And I would just move on <em>now</em> and ignore you, except that you&#39;ve repeated your slander against my friend, and I just want to note (apologizing to SEK for the derail) that you made that statement as she was <em>being followed from blog to blog by a reactionary who was literally trying to provoke fights about her politics regardless of the topic of her comment in each thread he subsequently visited.</em> What&#39;s more, you made it in response to lighthearted banter between her and SEK. You helped to silence her for a long time last year, Rich. You helped silence someone whose voice is far more important and persuasive than yours will ever be, someone who is actually doing the online organizing you laud instead of just browbeating people Puchalsky-style for doing it wrong.</p>

<p>In sum; bite me. And stop fucking jacketing my friends. </p>

<p>Apologies again, SEK, for the unpleasant derail, but my one regret about my part in all that shit last year is that I didn&#39;t respond to that as forcefully as it deserved, as decency and loyalty deserved. </p></span>

<p>You know, for someone complaining about &quot;year-old comments...&quot;  </p>

<p>I read the comment and the thread.  I think that the point about not casting aspersions on the motivations of A-list bloggers is a reasonable one.  I&#39;d dispute it, given the way that progressive &quot;side-issue&quot; real-world organizing is also treated.  However, your point and subsequent complaint about unfair assumptions are destroyed by &quot;sour grapes.&quot;  If you think writing-blogs and GOTV-blogs shouldn&#39;t be conflated because their keepers have some views in common, that&#39;s one thing.

<p>She was also having to deal with a lot of people who didn&#39;t know her assuming that she was a reformed reactionary who, uh, still hated progressives.  Some combination of convert&#39;s zeal and provocateuristining that was so nefarious that it made sense only to Ilyka.  </p>

<p>But ANYWAY.  Sorry to assist the derail!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Hugo had anything to do with this; I think it is spam.  And I don&#39;t know why you want to give him another opportunity to apologize for existing, Scott.  I think that&#39;s really irresponsible.  </p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/01/why-obama-lost.html"><span><strong>Why Obama Lost New Hampshire</strong> Not much has been written about The Ibogaine Effect as a serious factor in the New Hampshire primary, but toward the end of the race—about three hours before the vote—word leaked out that some of Obama's top advisors had called in a Brazilian doctor who was said to be treating the candidate with &quot;some kind of strange drug&quot; that nobody in the press corps had ever heard of. It had been common knowledge for many weeks that Clinton was using an exotic brand of speed known as Wallot ... and it had long been whispered that Obama was into something very heavy, but it was hard to take the talk seriously until I heard about the appearance of a mysterious Brazilian doctor. That was the key. Barack discussed the cocaine question for the dope-smoking students in Manchester, moments before refusing to snort himself. Later that night, however, it was reported that Senator Obama was a known user of a powerful drug called Ibogaine. I immediately recognized The Ibogaine Effect—from Obama's near-breakdown on the flatbed truck in Iowa, the delusions and altered thinking that characterized his campaign in New Hampshire, and finally the condition of &quot;total rage&quot; that gripped him in Ohio. There was no doubt about it: The Savior from Illinois had turned to massive doses of Ibogaine as a last resort. The only remaining question was &quot;when did he start?&quot; But nobody could answer this one, and I was not able to press the candidate himself for an answer because I was permanently barred from the Obama campaign after that incident on the &quot;Tall Corn Special&quot; in Iowa ... and that scene makes far more sense now than it did at the time. Obama has always taken pride in his ability to deal with hecklers; he has frequently challenged them, calling them up to the stage in front of big crowds and then forcing the poor bastards to debate with him in a blaze of TV lights. But there was none of that in New Hampshire. When the Boohoo began grabbing at his legs and screaming for more gin, Big Hussein went all to pieces ... which gave rise to speculation among reporters familiar with his campaign style, that Obama was not himself. It was noted, among other things, that he had developed a tendency to roll his eyes wildly during TV interviews, that his thought patterns had become strangely fragmented, and that not even his closest advisors could predict when he might suddenly spiral off into babbling rages, or neocomatose funks. In retrospect, however, it is easy to see why Obama fell apart in New Hampshire. There he was—far gone in a bad Ibogaine frenzy—suddenly shoved out in the blinding daylight to face an exuberant crowd and some kind of snarling lunatic going for his legs while he tried to explain why he was &quot;the only Democrat who can beat Romney.&quot; It is entirely conceivable—given the known effects of Ibogaine—that Obama's brain was almost paralyzed by hallucinations at...</span></a></div>
