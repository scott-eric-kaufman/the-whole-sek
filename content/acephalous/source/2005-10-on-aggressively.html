<p>Franzen, Marcus argues, encourages writers &quot;to behave like cover bands, embellishing the oldies, maybe, while ensuring that buried in the song is an old familiar melody to make us smile with recognition, so that we might read more from memory than by active attention.&quot;&nbsp; Thus begins his attack against the author of the (criminally over-rated but) award-winning novel <em>The Corrections</em>.&nbsp; It continues unabated for what remains of the article, and that's unfortunate, because at his best Marcus effectively communicates what, to scholars of realist and naturalist works, constitutes a commonplace but which, to the general reading public, the essays of Franzen and <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>'s B.R. Meyers frequently obscure:</p><blockquote><p>The fallacy that literary realists have some privileged relationship to reality has allowed the whole movement to soften and become false ... the exceptions are terrific writers who have pounded on the emotional possibilities of their mode, refusing to subscribe to worn-out techniques and storytelling methods so familiar we could pretty much sing along to them.&nbsp; These are writers who are keen to interrogate the assumptions of realism and bend the habitual gestures around new shapes.</p></blockquote><p>To not accept the strictures of realism is consign yourself to the unread stable of &quot;experimental writers&quot; whose &quot;work does not matter, is not readable, and is aggressively masturbatory.&quot;&nbsp; Critics disdain such writers, prefering instead realists whose work possesses &quot;enough surface flourishes and stylistic tics to allow a false show of originality, so that critics can dispense phrases like 'radically innovative' and 'a bold new voice,' when the only thing new is the writer's DNA.&quot;&nbsp; The article concludes with seven pages of close-readings in which Marcus demolishes the arguments Franzen proffers in a recent series of self-aggrandizing short fictions and self-serving book reviews.&nbsp; I won't repeat it—mostly because like all brilliant close-readings,&nbsp; citation ruins the brilliance of the reading and thus discredits whoever announces its brilliance—but needless to say, by the end of it I desperately wanted time enough to squeeze a re-reading Gaddis into my George Eliot heavy reading docket.&nbsp; Still, considering all this, I'm tempted to agree with Franzen.</p>

<p>I know, I know, that sounds terrible, but keep a couple things in mind:</p>

<ol><li>I adore a brilliant polemic and Marcus has penned one.&nbsp; </li>

<li>I read very little poetry by design and constitution.&nbsp; I lack the patience required to work through poetry if it lacks the puzzling qualities I value in writers like Joyce.&nbsp; (I mean &quot;puzzling&quot; literally there, as in &quot;like a puzzle&quot; which I'm enjoined to put back together.&nbsp; Hence my love/hate relationship with Gene Wolfe.)</li>

<li>As much as I love Marcus' own work, I read it incredibly slowly, and only on those most rare occasions when I can do so carefully.&nbsp; Now, this may be a symptom of my dissertation.&nbsp; I may tend toward realist novels now because I can't stomach any more ambiguity than I'm managed to create trying to untangle the knots that earlier realist writers wrote themselves into.&nbsp; But my late-evening laziness bolsters Marcus' claims, not Franzen's, even if I end up reading fictions more to Franzen's taste instead of Marcus'.&nbsp; While this situation is temporary for me, I doubt it is for the majority of the reading public ... and as Franzen said, better they read realist prose sans interrogation than another episode of <em>The O.C. </em>or <em>The Real Laguna Beach</em>.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; </li></ol>

<p>In short, I'm caught between Marcus' idealism and Franzen's pragmatism, and while I <em>think</em> Marcus is correct, I <em>intuit</em> Franzen is.&nbsp; &nbsp;Which is why I award Marcus the laurels in the end, despite agreeing with Franzen for the present.&nbsp; </p>

		<span id="comment-9971703-content"><p>Brad, I agree entirely.  In fact, I&#39;m come down on Marcus&#39; side of the polemic, even though I agree with Franzen&#39;s implicit claims about the needs of a lazy (or otherwise intellectually occupied) reader.  I mean, look at the list of books scrolling down the column to your right: not an experimental novel among them.</p>

<p>Adam, I&#39;m really torn by Wolfe, and at this point am only able to read him in small doses.  My opinion as to the experience of reading Wolfe as keeping the company of a single narrative voice hasn&#39;t changed (no matter how many layers of ironic distance people would have me place between him and his narrators); nor have I had the time to read some of the books in which his voice varies.  In short, I mostly agree with what the <i>other</i> other Adam said <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/on_terrible_neo.html#comment-9611995" rel="nofollow">earlier</a>.  Hence the love/hate.  I love him in small doses; hate him in long stretches...but he always writes series which compel me to read them for long stretches.  It&#39;s as if he <i>enjoys</i> torturing his readers.</p></span>

<p>Funny, funny.</p>

<p>Actually, since you like puzzles, I should add to my recommendation of Iain Banks.  Both &quot;The Bridge&quot; or &quot;Use of Weapons&quot; have a sort of highly structured, back-and-forth-in-time setup in which you slowly figure out more about the main character and their history, and both have highly developed symbolic sets which you can create for yourself or ignore as you prefer.  In a certain sense, aspects of the books are similar to Wolfe&#39;s puzzles, in that by careful tracking of the information given out, you can figure out things about the characters that you wouldn&#39;t otherwise notice (and that aren&#39;t really necessary towards following the story).  However, I find them vastly preferable because the main characters appear to have organically developed life histories and personalities, and aren&#39;t always being jerked around by whatever level of authorial plot-devicing you can choose to think is responsible for events in e.g. Wolfe&#39;s BOTNS (in which you can imagine that events are being manipulated by Wolfe as author, Severian as narrator, or the Heirodules / Heirogrammates as manipulators, but in which it&#39;s clear that someone is, er, snapping the whip).</p></span>

		<span id="comment-9975381-content"><p>Would David F. Wallace&#39;s new collection <i>really</i> be characterized as &#39;realist&#39;? </p>

<p>All the same, I&#39;m not entirely sure that Marcus would disagree either.  (His pot shots at realist fiction, notwithstanding.)  Ultimately, I think he recognizes that experimental fiction is a minor literature, in the grand scheme of contemporary literature. Neither lover of experimental of fiction, or an adherent to realism, should be at all bothered by this.  (The problem, I suppose, when either position wishes to demarcate the limits of what constitutes literary art.  In my opinion, Franzen seems far more willing to do this than Marcus.)</p>

<p>Can the distinction at stake here be boiled down to that between a &#39;hard&#39; novel and an &#39;easy&#39; novel?  If so ... what makes a realist novel easier?  At what point does one&#39;s commitment to realism turn into experimentalism -- when you&#39;ve taken too many lessons from Proust? What is limit of Franzen&#39;s argument.</p>

<p>Surely. it holds up on a very pragmatic level, but at what cost.  To put it in terms of cinema, are we to sacrifice Godard&#39;s <i>Masculine Feminine</i> for <i>Vertigo</i>, Fellini&#39;s <i>8 1/2</i> for the <i>Unforgiven</i>?  (I rather like all four.)  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re making this argument ... just wondering about the practical consequences of pragmatics.   </p></span>

		<span id="comment-10001648-content"><p>My editor passed on to me a rather striking statistic, derived I suppose from market research of some kind.  The majority of UK readers buy <i>one</i> book a year, usually when they&#39;re off on their hols (since they&#39;re going someplace without a TV), and they buy that book in the airport bookshop on the strength of either its first sentence, or its cover/placement in the shop/that &#39;they&#39;ve heard of it&#39;.  This book, whichever it is, becomes a bestseller, and it almost invariably demonstrates very similar narrative qualities to cinema ... which is to say, the song that&#39;s being covered is not another book so much as the narrative logic of film itself.  I don&#39;t want to sound snobbish here; cinema is a wonderful art form, and filmic narrative can be really powerful: there&#39;s a reason why it has become the dominant mode of narrative in our age.  But there are things, of course, that film can&#39;t do, and it is <i>just those things</i> that I&#39;m looking for when I read novels.  Otherwise I&#39;d give my tired end-of-the-workday brain a rest and just watch telly.</p>

<p>In other words, the problem with a novel like <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> is not that it&#39;s populist, genre, pulp, lowbrow, none of which categories I have a problem with; it&#39;s that it adheres so closely to the filmic paradigm there&#39;s nothing in it that wouldn&#39;t be better expressed that way.  A counter example is Cunningham&#39;s <i>The Hours</i>, which of course was made into a film: made with honourable intent, but failingly and clumsily made nevertheless.  To watch the film and to read the book is to see, I hope, what I mean here: by missing the exacting and carefully quilted stylistic textures of Cunningham&#39;s prose the film misses everything.  Even the <i>Corrections</i> (overpraised as it has been, I agree with the Headless One) has moments like this, apperceptions that could only be novelistic because they&#39;re about the way the world, the mind and the way the mind takes in and makes words all rub up against one another.  This isn&#39;t about genre (eg &#39;Literary Realists&#39; vs &#39;Fantasists&#39;); it&#39;s verbal.  There&#39;s an Anthony Burgess character (is it Enderby? Or the chap in <i>Earthly Powers</i>? I can&#39;t remember) who is told by somebody that poems are made out of feeling and passion, and replies &#39;oh no, very much no, poems are made out of words.&#39;  So there aren&#39;t any guitar-strings and all that paraphernalia in my Wernicke&#39;s area, I hope: it&#39;s a library.  Words are important in my life; they&#39;re how I communicate to other people and often how I think to myself, and they structure many of my attitudes and beliegs and concepts.  I&#39;m interested in art that shakes this word-thing in interesting ways.</p>

<p>It&#39;s for this reason that I&#39;d say the &#39;aggressively masturbatory&#39; tag is misapplied, not to mention a daft metaphor (it makes me picture a line of soldiers marching across no-man&#39;s-land wanking for victory).  &#39;Masturbatory&#39; gets used by rhetoricians who want to deride something that lacks popular appeal; but masturbation depends on a predominantly visual and conceptual stimulus, no?  You can masturbate to a picture of a naked person, or to the idea of one in your head, but surely not to the word &#39;naked&#39;.  (This, and the way these categories fit together in subjectivity is a complicated  business I know; and people do wank to prose, but -- I&#39;d suggest -- to prose that evokes the visual and cinematic experience, not to the Sirens chapter in <i>Ulysses</i>).  ButI suppose &#39;aggressively masturbatory&#39; makes a better jag than &#39;aggressively contemplative&#39; or &#39;aggressively literary&#39;.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-26551804-content"><p>I am still baffled by the stir that Franzen caused here.  Marcus is so obviously on target.  Artists in any medium can choose to be leaders or followers.  Franzen pretends that blind obeisance is a virtue.  Marcus rightly points out that it never has nor will produce an art worthy of examination.  Sure, a reader of genre work (i.e. conventional work) might respond positively to the first reading of that kind of work, because for him or her it appears to be fresh.  And then, like the heroin addict, he or she might forever seek a repetition of that initial experience, reading identical novel after novel (e.g. Silhouette Romances), never quite recapturing that initial excitement.  A reader of innovative work looks for an exciting, idiosyncratic, original read every time.  The choice is between complacency or challenge.  What is baffling is that those calling for complacency can find the energy to even raise their own voices.  Perhaps they should try to do that in their work.</p></span>

BAVO! but Hold the Encore!</strong> Will someone please inform BAVO that the concept of BAVO--a two-man academic thinktank, a.k.a. &quot;friendship,&quot; calling themselves what looks like (but from what I can tell isn't) an acronym--sounds terribly silly? While you're at it, let BAVO in on the secret that ending the title of every other article BAVO publishes with an exclamation point may lead people to believe BAVO really Really REALLY! enthusiastic or hysterical! Really! Unironic exclamation points destroy your credibility! Below the fold you can find the CFP which brought BAVO to my attention. Upon googling BAVO, some of the practical difficulties of being BAVO forced themselves upon me: when BAVO introduces a panel, which BAVO of BAVO does the speaking? Does BAVO alternate every other word with BAVO? Or does BAVO chant in unison? Does BAVO harmonize? Could BAVO harmonize? Because that would be the introductions to end all introductions. [I reserve the right to remove this post at my discretion. Currently, BAVO reminds me too much of BARJO or DEVO or some post-communist pro-socialist collective. If it turns out to be a reputable European thinktank which only seems forebodingly monolithic in translation, I'll admit to my mistake. Now, back to NERDT's Empire.] PSYCHOANALYSIS, URBAN THEORY AND THE CITY OF LATE CAPITALISM A three day international workshop Organized by BAVO &amp; Lorenzo Chiesa Jan van Eyck Academie, Maastricht, The Netherlands November 18th - 20th, 2005 Today, the long-held belief that urban culture is the engine par excellence for democratization and emancipation processes, has been dealt some lethal blows. If Marx and his avatars still dreamt of ‘the urban’ as the incubator and accelerator of universal solidarity and radical social change, today metropolitan areas are more often than not labelled as social time-bombs that threaten to draw its hinterland into a downward spiral of disintegration, segregation and mute violence. Similarly, if for Freud the metropolitan way of life provided the ‘humus’ for the modern hysterical subjectivity – endlessly questioning and ‘working through’ the traditional mores – today, in an environment in which individuals and communities redraw into technologically nurtured capsular environments, subjectivity seems to evaporate again into a generalized autism. In this conference we invite experts from the field of Marxist urban theory, radical political philosophy and Lacanian psychoanalysis to give presentations on topics relevant to understand the current post-metropolitan condition as well as ways to intervene or resist it. Day 1: Identifying the Urban Unconscious This day aims at the identification of the construct of the city of late capitalism. What are its basic procedures? How do they secure the city’s normal functioning? Or inversely, how is the city kept in a permanent &quot;state of emergency.&quot; Of special interest here are studies of Marxist-oriented urban theorists and Lacanian inspired psychoanalysts that lay bare how the city of late capitalism depends more and more on psychosocial processes to generate the necessary increase in ‘return value’ or to secure control over its subjects. Think of the production of geographies of fear, the stimulation of a phantasmatic economy...</span></a></div>

Theory's Empire is an ambitious volume, which seeks to provide a dissident's version of the Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism and to argue against the perceived pre-eminence of &quot;theory&quot; in literary criticism. The book is now beginning to attract attention from the mainstream media and will probably be the subject of symposia and debates over the next couple of years. A semi-organized symposium on the Valve, the blog of the Association of Literary Scholars and Critics, allowed a wide-ranging and active debate on the book within several weeks of its publication. The debate included responses from authors of pieces in Theory's Empire, as well as from prominent academics like John McGowan (an editor of the Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism) and Michael Bérubé, both of whom have successful blogs. But it also included, on an equal footing, responses from nonspecialists, like the Berkeley economics professor Brad DeLong, and from nonacademic bloggers with an interest in the topic, like Kevin Drum of The Washington Monthly. The result: an unusually high level of intelligent discussion around a topic more usually associated with stale pro- and anti-theory polemics. As McGowan describes it, &quot;This is not yet another round in the culture and theory wars. ... Is it possible that academics interested in such questions have won their way through to a place where they can be discussed and examined calmly? As someone whose most usual stance has been a plague on both your houses, I am hopeful.&quot; Yes, I realize Farrell and Holbo both post on Crooked Timber; and yes, I realize that Farrell's commented here recently as well; so yes, I realize that we're all patting each other on the back in some respects, and that there's something uncouth about it all, but positive play is positive play. If I hadn't written this entry, people would've read that article thinking the praise unvarnished and entirely deserved ... which it is, despite recent evidence to the contrary. (In the aforelinked conversation, everyone reserves the right to talk past everyone else and demands the right to be offended when anyone talks past them. In other words: not with a ten foot pole.)</span></a></div>
