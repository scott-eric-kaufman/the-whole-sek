Teaching insecure undergraduates how to dish out (politely) and take in (constructively) substantive criticism is always a hairy ordeal, so having an object lesson at hand is convenient. The intended benefit is more easily quantified: they learned how to couch their results of their minuscule survey in (some might say inappropriately) strong terms without resorting to outright lying. Consider this sample paragraph comprised of sentences my students produced in class today: Before elaborating on the findings from this study it is necessary to emphasize certain limitations that should be taken into account when interpreting these results. We lacked the time and resources required to collect data on thousands of college students, but the data we did collect consists of self-reported statements about variable emotional states. However, despite the fact that our sample population was relatively limited, we believe further analysis demonstrates that the results obtained via our survey support the hypothesis we put forward. Moreover, because there are strong theoretical reasons and an emerging literature suggesting the importance of findings, our provisional belief is that the relationship captured in our results is likely to be ubiquitous and that future research will bear this out. Due to variables present in every methodological approach, no type of data is perfect, and no single analysis can unequivocally answer a complex research question like the one we asked. Further research should be conducted in light of these limitations in order to confirm our results. Before you declare that I am training students to obscure the limitations of their work behind statements of technical honesty, remember that in order to present material that is only technically honest, they must understand what they can claim without lying and calibrate their prose accordingly.

By teaching students these methods in this direction, you are giving them the tools and skill to comprehend and function in the broader academic environment. By reminding them of the limits, the issues and the problems of this stuff, you can keep them from hurting the academic environment through their success. </p>

<p>The same holds for your Moore script lesson on artist intent- it&#39;s the most effective lesson concept I&#39;ve ever seen, but it would benefit from a similar partner pointing out the dangers of assuming universal determination, or in this case, the danger of rhetorically derived ethical relativism and the like. How about a lesson deconstructing the values of an Objectivist essay, or any one of the rationalizations of journalistic pseudo-objectivity through quotation?</p></span>

Also for the record: WOLVERINE! have better flow than the Young Cons, but as Ackerman notes, they also clearly write from the fringe, as their song repeatedly addresses the first black president as “boy”; has a lyric in which a rapper imagining herself as a soldier in Iraq declares herself “sick of smelling like a mosque after Ramadan”; and then features a birther talking about how Obama isn’t an American.But I'm sure the fact that mainstream conservatives are attracted to the increasingly bizarre elements of their movement has nothing to do with the rhetoric they use.</span></a></div>
