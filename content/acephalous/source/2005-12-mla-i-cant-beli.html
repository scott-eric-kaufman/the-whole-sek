		<span id="comment-12419981-content"><p>I was at the same session, and can verify that SEK&#39;s characterization of this individual&#39;s presentation is not even slightly unfair. If anything, it is generous. It leaves out one of the more irritating rhetorical moves s/he indulged repeatedly -- what can  be summed up as &quot;vague gesture towards profund topic and/or cognitive abyss that, alas, cannot be discussed now, due to time constraints.&quot; </p>

<p>Do this three, four....seven....ten times and gosh, it sure does seem like you are a heavy thinker. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-12424097-content"><p>I suppose it&#39;s reasonable to call it unprofessional. It&#39;s also a childish attempt to escape responsibility for one&#39;s performance. I&#39;d like to think it doesn&#39;t work at all to tell your paying audience that they&#39;re only witnessing a rehearsal, but maybe it does--until a particular variation on the trick gets old. Of course, I do it too. I suspect this childishness is kosher in academia because it looks like self-awareness and self-scrutiny, which is a sign of quality in the researcher.  </p></span>

I met someone who didn't feel comfortable revealing her online handle to me but she's obviously familiar with my work. I don't think she's lying either, since she introduced herself to me. It also brings up an interesting question: Are some ordinary names actually handles? Is &quot;Adam Kotsko&quot; really Adam Kotsko? Is he actually Tom Smith or Jason Jones? I ask because as I tried to coordinate the conversation I was currently having with ones I've had in comment sections past it occured to me that real-sounding names are neither more nor less likely to be real than obvious pseudonyms. So whoever you are online, Early Afternoon Interlocutor, know that you have blown the stitches of my world. (Not that it didn't need it.)</span></a></div>

Those who live quiet lives should not travel across the country and pretend they're Hunter S. Thompson and not expect dire fucking consequences. Around 3 a.m. I awoke shaking with a bone-chill four layers of sweaters and a heater could not kill. I took some Tylenol and stopped shaking . . . but I suspect my body had some threshold which I unwittingly crossed yesterday. I don't think I'm actually ill so much as toast. So unless the fifteen gallons of water I've imbibed have magical restorative powers, I will only venture to Brian Thill's panel today. (Otherwise I would have to admit I wasted valuable suitcase space on a giant foam finger.) UPDATE: A couple more hours of sleep and I'm young and alive again! Best. Flu-like. Symptoms. Ever.</span></a></div>
