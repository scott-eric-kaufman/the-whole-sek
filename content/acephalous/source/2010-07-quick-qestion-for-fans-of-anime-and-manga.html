<p>Well, in both films, the natural renewal occurs not at the end of the film, but after the credits roll, which suggests that a good deal of time has passed.  (Because if you sat through the credits, subjectively speaking, it has, what with credit sequences not being inherently entertaining.)</p>

<p>This is what I needed to know, as my knowledge of Japanese literature basically begins with Abe and ends with Murakami.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0134854d7ee6970c-content"><p>I&#39;ve watched all of Avatar: The Last Airbender (having kids in the right age range) and, as far as I know, it&#39;s really not Japanese.  It&#39;s an American series, and only has the structure that you see as an imitation (or homage, whatever) to Japanese works that it&#39;s following.  So whether it&#39;s a tic or is structural is not something that Avatar: TLA can really bear on.</p>

<p>Going back to some of the Japanese originals, many of which I&#39;ve seen in translation: I thought that they were quite notable for a certain kind of naive pacifism.  &quot;Naive&quot; because pacifism is girlish in these works, and therefore can&#39;t be the main focus of action until the end, when the girl-hero ends the war pacifistically and saves everyone.  It can only work once the requisite number of explosions have occurred, and isn&#39;t really a focus of struggle in its own right.</p>

<p>There&#39;s certainly (well, arguably) something there that&#39;s left from WW II in general, the A-bombs in specific.  Not an imitation of catastrophe-then-renewal, because as said above, the immediate aftermath wasn&#39;t renewal, but revulsion at war does seem to me to be left from that period.</p>

<p>These are children&#39;s stories though, in the main, and it&#39;s done childishly.  Or perhaps just badly translated.  And because it&#39;s genderified, there&#39;s a whole second level of possible discomfort there.</p></span>

<p>—three works,</p>

<p>—two of which are by one director, and</p>

<p>—one of which is American?</p>

<p>Or are there other works you have in mind here?  I mean, the <i>Evangelion</i> TV show ended this way (the movie, not really).  <i>Akira</i>…kind of.  We could talk about different works, but I just want to make sure that you&#39;re not generalizing about an entire genre (two, really, if we take manga as different from anime) based on such a scanty sample size.  If not, apologies, but the post made it seem that way.</p></span>

So whether it&#39;s a tic or is structural is not something that Avatar: TLA can really bear on.</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s just why it&#39;s important, though: its commitment to its source material would indicate that there is, in that source material, a similar structure. </p>

<p><em>Just as an example -- though I&#39;m not certain where it stands within Japanese lineage -- there&#39;s Minmei, the teenager who finally ends the war by singing.</em></p>

<p>I wrote a post about that years ago, but don&#39;t think I ever posted it: <em>Robotech</em>&#39;s a bad example for the very reason it&#39;s interesting: it&#39;s three entirely unrelated series dubbed to make them seem contiguous.  Quite an amazing feat, actually, of early mix-tape-type culture. </p>

<p><em>Just so we&#39;re clear, are you making this claim (sorry, this &quot;quick question&quot;) based on</p>

<p>—three works,</p>

<p>—two of which are by one director, and</p>

<p>—one of which is American?</em></p>

<p>I just chose those as examples, because <em>Avatar</em> is clearly, and I think playfully and quite brilliantly, derivative; it revels in its imitation of form, which suggests that its structure isn&#39;t incidental.  I&#39;ve been reading manga and watching anime in my spare time this summer, so I&#39;ve got quite a bit of it under my belt at this point—in truth, this post initially concerned adaptation, but the structural similarities <em>Nausicaa</em> and <em>Avatar</em> ended up not being the point, as Miyazaki&#39;s film ends the same place the manga did because of the production schedule.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a wonder you were able to finish your dissertation if you didn&#39;t allow yourself to generalize from examples.</p></span>

<p>Ah, but I didn&#39;t link to Robotech, I linked to Super Dimension Fortress Macross, the Japanese original (and what became the first part of Robotech after the adaptation).  The whole singing-girl-ends-the-war thing is there from before the three series were glued together.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a bit iffy about argument-from-Avatar here.  Avatar is playfully derivative, yes, but it&#39;s playfully derivative of the same anime that Americans were most likely to see and be influenced by -- the same ones that you&#39;re presumably most likely to have seen.  Do you remember the Season 3 Avatar: TLA episode &quot;The Ember Island Players&quot; where there&#39;s a play within the series that parodies and re-tells the story of the series, distorted in line with fan comments?   Remember how in that one Katara is parodied as someone who keeps weeping about how the Avatar is going to bring peace to everyone?   That&#39;s how Americans tend to perceive that role, which recurs in many of the series that Americans have watched.  I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s really representative of Japanese series as a whole, though, so I can&#39;t tell whether it&#39;s an influential creator&#39;s tic that being imitated or something throughout the genre.  If you want to talk about the Japanese genre as opposed to its American reflection, I think you have to go back to Japanese works.</p></span>

<p>I&#39;ve only been reading this intensely for a month, so I&#39;m open to suggestions.  I did get through a bit of <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, and thought it&#39;d be interesting to teaching alongside <em>Firefly</em>—since <em>CB</em> appropriates from the West, <em>Firefly</em> from the East, and yet they&#39;re both mostly about bounties—but it does actually seem like an exceptional show, inasmuch as it borrows so many American motifs and stances.  I&#39;m not familiar with <em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em> or <em>Trigun</em>, but I&#39;m not averse to looking into them.  Just the opposite, in fact.</p>

<p>Again, posts like this one should indicate a fundamental insecurity and a reaching out to people who, like you, and as the title suggests, are bigger &quot;fans of anime and manga&quot; than I am.  That said, I still feel a responsibility to cover them in a book about visual rhetoric, given their increasing domination of the market.</p></span>

Both were good fun along the way, had climactic moments that didn&#39;t entirely make sense, and ended in a fairly sentimental manner (IIRC-- I don&#39;t recall all of the details of either ending).</p>

<p><i>Cowboy Bebop</i> is a clear exception, I think. <i>Samurai Champloo</i>, though, by some of the same people, would tend to fit. Again, depending on the definitions.<br />

<p>You might want to check out Outlaw Star too, since it is like Cowboy Bebop and Firefly in that it is about bounty hunters and rag-tag group of misfits traveling around space and whatnot, and also because Firefly (strangely) quotes the very image in Outlaw Star of &quot;the-girl-in-the-suitcase.&quot; <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/bbs/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=703&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0" rel="nofollow">The parallels are discussed more on this forum</a>. <br />

<p>May I ask, are you working with just the film of <i>Nausicaa</i>, or the extended-story manga that Miyazaki produced after the film? I&#39;m sorry, it seems like you mention the manga here, but since it doesn&#39;t end at the same point as the film, I can&#39;t quite tell. Either way, i think the ending of the manga is much more ambiguous than that of the film. <i>Mononoke</i> is often billed as Miyazaki&#39;s do-over of <i>Nausicaa</i>, but the more advanced technological world of the <i>Nausicaa</i> manga allows for an epilogue to the epic-disaster climax that is fairly cynical when compared to both <i>Mononoke</i> and the <i>Nausicaa</i> film.</p>

<p>I absolutely second the &quot;please please don&#39;t&quot; comment about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but, that said, if you&#39;re interested in reading something that <i>does</i> posit a relationship between anime &amp; manga, fandom, victim consciousness and the bombs, Takashi Murakami is all over that in his writings on superflat and his Little Boy exhibition. Also, I&#39;d be really really surprised if you hadn&#39;t discovered or had this recommended to you yet, but Thomas Lamarre&#39;s recent book <i>The Anime Machine</i> would probably be great to mine for secondary sources and other good leads. He touches on Murakami and goes into pretty deep detail about Miyazaki&#39;s many personal tics.</p>

<p>Finally, while it definitely makes sense to focus on epic destruction narratives because they&#39;re internationally the highest-profile variety of anime and manga,it helps to remember that there&#39;s also a lot of manga about baseball (for example). Very few explosions, but still lots of sentimentality.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f229aa84970b-content"><p>I&#39;m no expert on anime or manga, but I worry that &quot;grossly sentimental denouement&quot; is expansive enough to cover anything short of bleak nothingness. Also, it&#39;s animation. One would never even bother to describe a Disney film as having a &quot;grossly sentimental denouement,&quot; because it would be impossible to imagine them as ending any other way.  On the other hand I wonder if &quot;epic nonsensical climax&quot; is quite the thing.  I mean, yes they often feel that way, but I don&#39;t think &quot;nonsensical&quot; is what the films I&#39;ve seen are actually going for.  I think it&#39;s more that they tat together a set of abitrary but semi-coherent rules for the world that their constructing and then explain that it was fine at the time but the laws have changed, yeah, and so there&#39;s now a starchild, who legend foretells... Anyway, the point is that I think anime generally does some version of the Fantasy thing of world-building, but then tries to do so as impressionistically as possible. So the world only has to maintain enough internal coherence not to trip over itself irreperably.  Sometimes this works (&quot;FCLC&quot; attains only the loosest kind of coherence by the end of the series, and it&#39;s creator basically made it up as he went along, but the characters and visual and stylistic sensibility still hold together) and sometimes it doesn&#39;t (&quot;Metropolis&quot; for me, despite stunning visuals, never became more than a series of borrowed plot elements in search of a shared movie), but with a few surrealist exceptions (like the haunting dream-tastic &quot;Cat Soup&quot;) they&#39;re all at least trying for the impression of coherence.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0134854f9ed2970c-content"><p>Well, if you really wanted to you could trace it way back;  Genji dies about 3/4ths of the way through Genji Monogatari, and the remaining 13 chapters could well be described as a lengthy denouement, with the rest of the characters carrying on and finally overcoming Genji&#39;s legacy.  But then you&#39;d have to justify cultural essentialism in a culture with several major historical breaks.</p>

<p>I think a more relevant cultural phenomenon is serialization;  Japanese literature is produced in serialized form to a much greater extent than in the West.  Most of the &quot;novels&quot; in the modern Japanese literary canon were originally serialized in newspapers and magazines, and of course manga is almost exclusively serialized.  </p>

<p>Unlike the tight control over form and structure the coherent novel affords, serialized works tend to be more relaxed structurally.  Or perhaps it would be better to say their structural focus is on the individual chapter; each serialized unit must intrigue the reader and advance the plot, so perhaps a lengthy denouement after the plot climax, where the loose ends are tied up after readers are already invested in the story, makes sense in that context.</p>

<p>But I suspect newspaper readers clamoring for another installment that ties all the loose ends is a major reason you see less of the quick denouements with much left unresolved that you do in the West.</p>

<p>Of course, the movies you mentioned were not (to the best of my knowledge) serialized as manga first, but that is the kind of literary environment they were conceived in.</p>

<p>I would be interested to know if there are further examples.</p></span>

<p>Most of the ticks you see in Anime and Manga are products of two things: Disney and Manga release schedules. Anime is directly based off of the early Disney films that were imported to Japan. Things like the large-eyed, small-nosed features of the characters, the dopey sidekicks, and animal friends were drawn directly from Disney films. And how do most Disney films end? In an epic nonsensical disaster followed by a natural renewal.</p>

<p>A lot of Anime, not just series but movies as well, is based off of popular Manga. Manga is released usually in either monthly of quarterly installments. It is picked up after it becomes popular, which is usually six months after being initially released. If you factor in the time it takes to produce an animated film or series (6 months to a year), this ends up with you having 6-18 installments of a Manga by time the series or film is released. The average length of a Manga series is 2-4 years, with a total of 8-48 installments. The end result is that most series or Anime will be finished and released <i>before</i> the Manga reaches it&#39;s conclusion. This requires an ending to be written for the Anime. This ending is ususally written by someone other than the original author. That&#39;s why most fans agree that Manga tend to have better ending than Anime. It also leads to Anime having more contrived/formulaic endings as compared to Manga.</p></span>

How would you possibly talk about the Godzilla movies, say, without reference to them?   It&#39;s clearly a major idea within Japanese culture, and I don&#39;t see why people seem to be treating as a sort of Godwin effect.  If I wrote &quot;the Holocaust is a major idea within Israeli culture&quot; that&#39;s not a Godwinning, it&#39;s just fact.</p></span>

(Despite the inherent nonsensicality of &quot;world conflict resolves when hobbit pitches ring into volcano&quot;.)  Is the denouement grossly sentimental, with the Scouring of the Shire and all that?</p>

<p>The description, by itself, doesn&#39;t seem specific enough.  The epic climax that you&#39;re thinking about specifically has to involve mass destruction, doesn&#39;t it?  The problem is that in many Japanese works that I&#39;ve seen, the destruction happens at the beginning, followed by a long squabble over the ruins, and an epic climax to the fighting at the end that does not lead to so much as permit the renewal, which happens via other mechanisms.  Think Avatar: TLA and the epic fighting in the invasion, and later, among the airships, and even between the Avatar and the firelord.  None of that really turns out to matter.  The whole thing is settled by the post-fighting conflict of powers between Aang and the firelord, in which peace sort of drives out war.</p></span>

<p><em>I&#39;m a bit iffy about argument-from-Avatar here. Avatar is playfully derivative, yes, but it&#39;s playfully derivative of the same anime that Americans were most likely to see and be influenced by -- the same ones that you&#39;re presumably most likely to have seen.</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure whether that&#39;s a feature or a bug, though, as the book&#39;s aimed at an undergraduate audience who won&#39;t always, as is the case at UCI, more familiar with anime/manga than I am.</p>

<p><em>Do you remember the Season 3 Avatar: TLA episode &quot;The Ember Island Players&quot; where there&#39;s a play within the series that parodies and re-tells the story of the series, distorted in line with fan comments? Remember how in that one Katara is parodied as someone who keeps weeping about how the Avatar is going to bring peace to everyone?</em></p>

<p>My understanding of that episode is that it served as a recap for fans, especially younger ones, prior to the series finale.  That it also worked as a parody of the series, and, potentially, how anime watchers might perceive it is a bit of brilliance.</p>

<p><em>If you want to talk about the Japanese genre as opposed to its American reflection, I think you have to go back to Japanese works.</em></p>

<p>This is still a question that&#39;s up in the air.</p>

<p>Orzelc:</p>

<p><em>I&#39;d need a clearer definition of both &quot;epic nonsensical climax&quot; and &quot;grossly sentimental denouement&quot; to say for sure</em></p>

<p>I am, admittedly, speaking in shorthand, but I&#39;d define the former as &quot;anything involving a sometimes hyper-mystical, sometimes hyper-technological armageddon-type clash between outrageously powerful forces,&quot; and the latter as &quot;anything that fits with what we commonly identify as sentimental tropes, <em>i.e.</em> the death of a child, a long-awaited, oft-postponed, but non-sexualized consummation of a love affair, etc.&quot;  Admittedly, you can shoehorn quite a bit into those definitions too, but its the frequency with which they arise together in the genre I&#39;ve been reading---which means, not the high school melodramas, or sports books, or tentacle porn, etc.---that&#39;s struck me.</p>

<p>Jake:</p>

<p>But that&#39;s what I&#39;m not doing in this chapter!  It&#39;s just damn interesting in the way the two series reverse cultural polarities, so to speak; but it is something I&#39;ll end up investigating anyway, because now I can&#39;t not.</p>

<p>Stompie:</p>

<p><em>May I ask, are you working with just the film of Nausicaa, or the extended-story manga that Miyazaki produced after the film? I&#39;m sorry, it seems like you mention the manga here, but since it doesn&#39;t end at the same point as the film, I can&#39;t quite tell. </em></p>

<p>Since the book is about visual rhetoric---titled <em>Seeing Rhetoric</em>---I&#39;m trying to stick to comics that have film counterparts.  I read all of <em>Nausicaa</em>, though, and agree that it&#39;s far more ambiguous.  Still, it&#39;s significant that the first book was considered, say, &quot;complete enough&quot; to stand alone as a narrative.  That it&#39;s not the <em>end</em> of the narrative is significant too, but that&#39;s one of the aspects film vs. comics that will be highlighted in the book as a whole---starting, most likely, with Eco&#39;s take on eternal recurrence in the comic medium in &quot;The Myth of Superman.&quot;</p>

<p><em>I&#39;d be really really surprised if you hadn&#39;t discovered or had this recommended to you yet, but Thomas Lamarre&#39;s recent book The Anime Machine would probably be great to mine for secondary sources and other good leads. He touches on Murakami and goes into pretty deep detail about Miyazaki&#39;s many personal tics.</em></p>

<p>That would be a negative on both fronts: I&#39;ve spent the past month with primary texts and haven&#39;t started in with the secondary ones yet, as I like to have a feel for the sources; otherwise, the criticism overdetermines my reading of them ... as I learned during my qualifying exams. </p>

<p><em>Finally, while it definitely makes sense to focus on epic destruction narratives because they&#39;re internationally the highest-profile variety of anime and manga,it helps to remember that there&#39;s also a lot of manga about baseball (for example). Very few explosions, but still lots of sentimentality.</em></p>

<p>Availability is also an issue.  While the Barnes and Noble in Southern California may have a wall of manga, the same can&#39;t be said in, say, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>More replies in a bit.  Need to run some errands.</p></span>

To which I replied: My my. Then I started writing this post, which is, as per the title, about James Hudnall’s remarkably unselfconscious rant about Wonder Woman. Hudnall’s not interested in her costume change, which was apparently a topic of no small interest while I had my head in the sand, and about which all I have to say is this: if you attended a meeting and were the only one there wearing a swimsuit, would you feel uncomfortable? Enough said. For Hudnall, though, the debate about her costume merely provides him an excuse to attack her character. Like many a spurned misogynist, he does so by accusing her, and by proxy all feminists, of misandry. He begins: The problem with Wonder Woman isn’t her look. It’s her personality. She has never been a warm, appealing character. She comes from an island populated only by immortal Amazons who hate men. And men aren’t allowed to set foot on the island. This island of super-women send her to “the man’s world” where she brings the baggage of this sexist worldview. You want to talk about baggage? Consider what Hudnall brings to the table: women who are not “warm” are also not “appealing.” The first question, obviously, is what does he mean by “warm”? The second, of course, is “appealing” to whom? That he failed to notice that his definition of “warmth” entails that she must be “appealing” to men like him is a remarkable, albeit typical among his lot, feat of argumentative blindness: women who possess characteristics that he finds unattractive hate all men because they fail to cater or conform to Hudnall’s needs. In addition to his inability to distinguish the universal from the particular, he simply misunderstands the character. Wonder Woman does enjoy giving those who underestimate her because she’s a woman, be they thugs or comic villains, their comeuppance—a category that by extension includes readers like Hudnall, but more on that in a bit. But notice what Hudnall fails to: the comic universe is predicated on the logic of a vicarious enjoyment of comeuppance. Consider this scene in The Dark Knight. The nifty camerawork helps ratchet up the tension on a formal level, but on a narrative one, the tension comes from the viewer knowing what the Joker doesn’t: the implications of having crashed Bruce Wayne’s fundraiser. The viewer anticipates the comeuppance, because the Joker underestimated Wayne on account of his being a wealthy playboy. Same thing works in any situation in which Clark Kent is threatened. It even girds works that demonstrate the limitations of the genre, as that last panel neatly illustrates. In other words, despite being the motivating force behind the genre, the logic comeuppance only bothers Hudnall when men who underestimate women receive theirs. I wonder why that is? Let’s deal with some reality for a second. I know the PC crowd and...</span></a></div>
