I <i>did</i> experience the full thrill of the OTP joint (that&#39;s the word, right? Probably not. Whatever. Word.), though: I thought the way they start out in the voice of a disappointed Obama voter is, if you&#39;ll pardon the expression, rhetorically interesting, since I&#39;m quite certain that there&#39;s almost no overlap between Obama voters, independent or otherwise, and the Riefenstaal-manques producing agitprop art for the Tea Party wing.</p></span>

<p>I just want to say that your ability to seek out and watch or read all varieties of conservative crap is admirable, as I could not get through more than 50 seconds of that video before turning it off and ramming my head into a wall.  You are performing some kind of public service, watching all this so that we don&#39;t have to.</p></span>

<p>It&#39;s the idea of a homosexuality as a historic threat to christian civilization, I&#39;d wager. The ancient Greeks were kinda equivocal about this stuff too, and more to the point, they weren&#39;t christians, so what could they know?</p></span>

<p>Actually, the Athenians behind the curtain were women: the gynaeceum was separated from men&#39;s living space, and respectable women rarely appeared in public without being veiled. Hellas being what it was, other city cultures varied.</p></span>

<p>Mwanga II came to power as Kabaka (king) of Buganda in 1884, at a time when Muslims, Catholics and Protestants were all vying for converts and political influence or control within the kingdom.  His father, Mutesa, had executed a number of Muslim converts over accusations of disloyalty.  Mwanga saw the primary threat to his authority coming from Christian converts, but while he executed or in other ways punished some Christians, he promoted others to high office.</p>

<p>The twenty-two executed young men were pages within the royal court.  While Mitchell is just making shit up in his &quot;passed legislation&quot; line, there was the general understanding that advances of the King could not be reasonably refused.  Over the course of his reign Mwanga took sixteen wives, but he was also known for taking young men as sexual partners.  This was seen as a vice both in Ganda culture and among the converts, but his power as Kabaka gave him license to behave in ways that would violate standard social norms.  The refusal of the Catholic pages to submit to his advances, as well as their proximity to him as members of the court, were among the factor that spurred his execution of them in a rage over what he perceived to be Christian disloyalty.  Ugandans today primarily remember the Uganda Martyrs for their execution as Christians/Catholics, rather than anything to do with sexual politics.</p>

<p>Ron Kassimir has a good recent survey of this history and the classic account is by John Rowe:</p>

<p>Ronald Kassimir, &quot;Complex Martyrs: Symbols of Catholic Church Formation and Political Differentiation in Uganda.&quot; African Affairs, Vol. 90, No. 360 (1991), pp. 357-382.</p>

<p>J. A. Rowe, &quot;The Purge of Christians at Mwanga&#39;s Court: A Reassessment of This Episode in Buganda History.&quot; The Journal of African History, Vol. 5, No. 1 (1964), pp. 55-72.</p></span>

Yeah, though of course it&#39;s a moral economy/politics of legitimacy kind of thing — Holly Hanson has argued that the big change in the late-nineteenth century was from a basically patrimonial relationship between rulers and subject in Buganda to one conditioned primarily by violence, which in turn encouraged factional conflicts.<br />
So in simpler terms, <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2010/03/04/lessons-of-history-2/" rel="nofollow">historians aren&#39;t very good at simpler terms</a>.</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01310f7cac86970c-content"><p>Well, I have a couple of things to chime in about on what that lovely video had to say.  JPool was right about Mwanga, but what needs to also be pointed out was that Mwanga wasn&#39;t executed by anyone, but rather exiled and eventually became a convert himself--he died in 1903 (quite a few years off of 1886).  The June 3rd date refers to a catholic saint that was burned alive for his beliefs.  (You know, I really hate it when facts get in the way of brainwashing people.)</p>

<p>Furthermore, I love how the &#39;news reporter&#39; cites Genesis 9:6.  This passage basically says that no one has the right to spill the blood of another person.  Yet this passage is being used to support the death of gays?... how... but the... and with... (my head is spinning trying to fathom the contradiction.)</p></span>

The unintended benefit of being upbraided by the Internets was that it allowed me to show my students how to handle criticism honestly and with humility the week before they engage in a massive peer review exercise. Teaching insecure undergraduates how to dish out (politely) and take in (constructively) substantive criticism is always a hairy ordeal, so having an object lesson at hand is convenient. The intended benefit is more easily quantified: they learned how to couch their results of their minuscule survey in (some might say inappropriately) strong terms without resorting to outright lying. Consider this sample paragraph comprised of sentences my students produced in class today: Before elaborating on the findings from this study it is necessary to emphasize certain limitations that should be taken into account when interpreting these results. We lacked the time and resources required to collect data on thousands of college students, but the data we did collect consists of self-reported statements about variable emotional states. However, despite the fact that our sample population was relatively limited, we believe further analysis demonstrates that the results obtained via our survey support the hypothesis we put forward. Moreover, because there are strong theoretical reasons and an emerging literature suggesting the importance of findings, our provisional belief is that the relationship captured in our results is likely to be ubiquitous and that future research will bear this out. Due to variables present in every methodological approach, no type of data is perfect, and no single analysis can unequivocally answer a complex research question like the one we asked. Further research should be conducted in light of these limitations in order to confirm our results. Before you declare that I am training students to obscure the limitations of their work behind statements of technical honesty, remember that in order to present material that is only technically honest, they must understand what they can claim without lying and calibrate their prose accordingly. Forcing them to pay attention to the relationship between their arguments and the language in which they couch them is difficult to do. Students balk at evaluating the strength of what their words claim because they believe that their readers will intuitively understand the purview of their arguments. This exercise disabuses them of that mistaken notion, so while it may be ignoble in its execution, its effect on the structure of their claims is revelatory. Consider the conversation the class had about this sentence: We lacked the time and resources required to collect data on thousands of college students, but the data we did collect consists of self-reported statements about variable emotional states. They thought that mentioning &quot;thousands of college students&quot; implied that they had surveyed &quot;hundreds,&quot; and that using &quot;but&quot; instead of &quot;and&quot; suggested, on a grammatical level, that relying...</span></a></div>
