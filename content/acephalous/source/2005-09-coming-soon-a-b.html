	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/exhaustion_vaca.html"><span><strong>Exhaustion, Vacation &amp; Scholarly Matters (Syllabi, Class Blogs &amp; the MLA) </strong> Just when I'm too exhausted to think about Louisiana anymore, it dawns on me that the vacation the wife and I planned months ago is suddenly upon us. As in &quot;Leaving for San Francisco on Sunday.&quot; This may be a good thing considering how I can't possibly feel any more impotent than I currently do, but this leaves many things up in the air. To speak of things unrelated to Katrina: This means another week without my laptop, so another week without regular updates here, at the Valve, or on my dissertation. (That's the thing I intended on finishing a chapter of before I went on this vacation and before the quarter started. Contingency intervenes again.) This means another week without finishing the posts I've already nearly finished on The Literary Wittgenstein and The Plot Against America. (That may be a good thing. Give people a vacation from what they may consider tired topics at this point.) This means another week of not finishing my syllabus for the Fall Quarter or the teaching blog I've created for the students. It'll be a whiz-bang blog when it's finished, complete with links to publications favorable to literary journalism; reviews of works of literary journalism (such as have appeared on the Valve and other blogs); mini-interviews I have and will be conducting with some of the authors the students will be reading this quarter; and much, much more. It'll be the teaching blog to top all teaching blogs. It will make class preparation more entertaining for me because I enjoy this blogging thing more than the class preparation thing. (I love the class-teaching thing, the student-interacting thing, and the seeing-students-improve-from-paper-to-paper thing.) But this will have to wait. So will the decision on whether or not to attend the MLA this year. Jonathan, Sean et al. have been fairly convincing (even though given the availability of departmental funding and the generally miserly life the wife and I live, money wouldn't be an issue). If it will be no more traumatic to be there and sell myself than to simply be there, I might as well pocket that money, skip the trauma and spend the winter working.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/ready_shoot_aim.html"><span><strong>Ready, Shoot, Aim!</strong> Would that I had the gall to rename this blog that. So I'm off to &quot;NorCal&quot; in the morning. (I've been told that if I want to fit in I need to call it &quot;NorCal,&quot; but since SoCal's abbreviated &quot;SoCal,&quot; I'm not sure if I've been had or not. Probably.) I fully intend on enjoying this vacation. I'll be re-reading Michael Lewis' (of Moneyball fame) account of his years at Salomon Brothers, Liar's Poker, and following it up by being the last boy on the block to read Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrrell. (And yes, I'll also be re-reading Moneyball, because it's the best popular book about the numerous attempts to quantify human behavior and develop sophisticated predicative models based on said quantifications...and it's about the Oakland A's, who I may have an opportunity to see while I'm in &quot;NorCal.&quot;) One thing I won't be doing is visitng Jack London Square. &quot;Outstanding Shopping, Dining, and Entertainment&quot;? In Jack London Square? Soapboxes topped by socialists I'd understand. Spencerians screaming &quot;progress, Progress, PROGRESS&quot; wouldn't surprise. But &quot;Outstanding Shopping, Dining, and Entertainment&quot;? No thank you. Jack London State Historic Park, to the contrary, looks to embody his own contradictions instead of those of modern consumer capitalism. I find that more palatable and fully attend on visiting the charred remains of Wolf House (pictured on your immediate left). I may also visit the boulder under which he insisted he be buried. Such somber processions I can stomach at times like these. Visiting the birthplace of the Dead, on the other hand, turns it. I'll address many issues (and answer many questions) upon my return. But don't think that I won't be updating this here blog in every WiFi outfitted coffee shop from Irvine to Napa Valley. Because I will be. (And with all that time to think I'll answer intelligently many an important question, including the one asked by Cam, which if I weren't packing and/or avoiding thinking unpleasant thoughts about quarters beginning or Louisiana, I'd address immediately.)</span></a></div>
