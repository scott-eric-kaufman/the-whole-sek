		<span id="comment-82287851-content"><p>I heartily disagree with you about Herbstreit; can you say what it is you don&#39;t like about him?  Any sample bits of non-wisdom?  His GameDay analysis has always seemed savvy, and his color commentary during the Cal-Tennessee game was great.  So was Musburger, I thought.</p>

<p>Now, regarding this one game…I don&#39;t think it&#39;s their fault.  The media always feels compelled to emphasize the &quot;healing power of sport&quot; story, and it was clear from the beginning of the season that this is what was going to be talked about whenever VT came up.  And it&#39;s equally clear that they can&#39;t talk about Virginia&#39;s tragedy without talking about Louisiana&#39;s, lest people write in about tragedy disparity.  Hence…</p></span>

		<span id="comment-82361257-content"><p>My main complaint about Herbstreit is that he&#39;s lazily inaccurate.  A former QB should be able to tell the difference between a 3-4 and a 4-3 set-up, yet he consistently punts it.  He mistakes nickels for dimes, then chides the QB for making the wrong call at the line.  I know he probably knows what he&#39;s talking about, but once he finds a narrative, he sticks to it.  Whether this is done purposely or not, I don&#39;t know, but it <em>really</em> bothers me.  I mean, I&#39;m looking at the reply too!  That&#39;s a 3-4 package with a safety blitzing from the corner, not a 4-3 with four linemen!</p>

<p>He did this <em>all game long</em>.  Perhaps it did have something to do with &quot;the healing power of sports&quot; being forced upon them ... but still, it&#39;s extremely annoying when your experts don&#39;t demonstrate, well, expertise.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-82623601-content"><p>OK.....If one more person talks about Katrina and LSU in the same sentence, they should be shot. It has been long enough since Katrina to stop feeling sorry about what happened. I am not saying this to be mean; I am saying it because I deal with Katrina people almost daily. This group of people are mentioned each and every day here and most people just don&#39;t want to here it anymore. VT has had its share of sadness, but please don&#39;t keep reminding them. They won&#39;t forget and they want to get on with life. Make a football game about football. This is what the colle wants to happen. Get someone to announce that really knows what they are talking about and not one that constantly want to make our hearts bleed, along with our ears.  Turn the sound off and call the game yourself, this would have been a better way to watch this week game.  GO TIGERS!!!</p></span>

The Robotech Treatment</strong> Surprisingly, I loved Robotech as a child. I say &quot;surprisingly&quot; because, by and large, I never had a clue what was going on. The events in one episode would take place in space and the good guys would look like this while the bad guys like this. The next episode would feature a completely different cast, be on a planet, and pit these folks against these. Then another cast would arrive at a planet from space in one of these and all I could do was repeat to myself, mantra-like: &quot;They all want the Protoculture ... They all want the Protoculture ... They all want the Protoculture.&quot; (It goes without saying that I had no idea what &quot;Protoculture&quot; was nor why anyone would want it.) Turns out, I had every reason to be confused: Robotech is a story adapted with edited content and revised dialogue from the animation of three different mecha anime series: The Super Dimension Fortress Macross, Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross, and Genesis Climber Mospeada. It never occurred to me that the best way to fill up a syndication schedule would be to splice three completely unrelated stories into a single, nonsensical narrative. Of course, creating nonsense is simple: first-generation Care Bears could evolve in My Little Pony (or vice versa) and frolic until the the arrival of the evil Popples, &amp;c. I wonder whether we can't do the same for literature, only in a sensible fashion? Who wouldn't want to read, say, The House of Sister Carrie Bradshaw, the moving novel about a woman who almost has it all, is reduced to nothing, and (scratch death scene, insert amnesia-inducing bonnet-frilling accident) moves to the country, only to return to the city, rise from nothing, become an actress, and (add in some literary aspirations and play up the fact that as &quot;Lily,&quot; &quot;Carrie&quot; was quite knowledgeable about contemporary fashion) becomes a noted advice columnist no more able to run her own life now than &quot;Lily&quot; had been before her accident. I'm sure you can muster better.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/09/my-kind-of-evid.html"><span><strong>My Kind of Evidentiary Standard</strong> In his 1987 bestseller A History of the Jews, Paul Johnson claims the story of Moses must be true because it is &quot;beyond the power of the human mind to invent&quot; (27). The preceding sentence is instructive: That is why the contention of Wellhausen and his school that Moses was a later fiction and the Mosaic code a fabrication of the post-Exilic priests in the second half of the first millennium BC—a view still held by some historians today—is skepticism carried to the point of fanaticism, a vandalizing of the historical record. The historical record, then, consists of material too outlandish to invent, the likes of which only a fanatic would challenge. To question its outlandishness is vandalism; one must merely acknowledge it and move on. This odd logic obtains despite the fact that, as Edward Said discusses in &quot;Invention, Memory, and Place&quot; (2000), Jewish historians are well-aware of the purposes to which Jewish history has been deliberately put: In her 1995 book Recovered Roots: Collective Memory and the Making of an Israeli National Tradition, the Israeli-American historian Yael Zerubavel shows how before the late nineteenth century the story of Masada was unknown to most Jews. Then in 1862 a Hebrew translation of the Roman sources of Masada in Josephus's War of the Jews was published, and in a short time the story was transformed by reconstruction into four important things: &quot;a major turning point in Jewish history, a locus of modern pilgrimage, a famous archaeological site, and a contemporary political metaphor&quot; (63). So another story &quot;beyond the power of the human mind to invent&quot; must also be true, again on the basis of its outlandishness, only now everyone knows the fix is on. General Yigael Yadin excavates Masada in 1948, finds no compelling proof that a mass-suicide didn't occur, then declares that it did. And people believe him. Despite how it looks, this must be a compelling argument: Concoct something unbelievable. Locate a place in which no evidence of the unbelievable event can be found. Declare the absence of evidence proves the unbelievable occurred because it cannot be disproved. I think I'm going to wander back north and see what evidence I can't find. I know I should have my outlandish claims prepared before I leave, but that's what's so wonderful about this methodology: I need only concoct something outlandish enough there's little chance any relevant evidence (contradictory or otherwise) will ever be found. I can picture the opening line of my first article already: &quot;Scholars have long believed Jack London possessed the power of flight ... &quot;</span></a></div>
