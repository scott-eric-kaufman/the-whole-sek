        <meta name="description" content="There's nothing like the present to click the past into place. Take the following exchange, from a terrible 19th Century American novel, between a proto-neurologist narrator describes and his poet-sculptor friend. Said the poet-sculptor: &quot;At that moment I became aware of a black figure on my left side. It was literally shrouded from head to foot; even the face and th e extremities were hidden. At first I was surprised, and then by degrees a deadly fear possessed. I was motionless, and it did not stir. I turned to face it, but, as I did so, it moved so as to keep relatively to me the same positon. The whole act, if I may call it that, lasted, I should say, a minute. Then an agitation seized the form, as f it were convulsed under its black cloack, and a faint glow, like phosphorescence, ran along the lines of the drapery, and it was gone.&quot; &quot;As he lost [the black figure],&quot; said [the proto-neurologist], &quot;he felt a violent pain over his left eye, and this was one of his usual attacks of neualgic headaches. It was merely the substitution of a figure of a cloaked man for the lines of zigzag light which usually precede his headaches, and are not very rare. One man sees stars falling, one a catharine-wheel; but the appearance of distinct human or other forms in their place is a recent observation.&quot; When I stumbled across this passage, I wondered whether the part of the poet's brain responsible for both the headache and the &quot;cloaked man&quot; was the left temporoparietal junction. Stimulate it and you'll feel a shadowy presence following you. Could the proto-neurologist have pinpointed a defect within the left TPJ of the poet-sculptor? We'll never know, of course. The author of this novel, Silas Weir Mitchell, was himself a proto-neurologist, and he claimed to have based the poet-sculptor on his friends and patients in equal measure; so the possibility of something scientifical being recorded in this passage remains. To my chagrin, it seems the impulse to transform literature into science still roosts high in my rafters, its cackles audible across the years. Whatever else it is, literature is not evidence in the scientific sense. The words are an intercessory of something-we-know-not-what, and to treat them as scientific evidence would put us league with those who think evolution &quot;just a theory&quot;—same mistake, only from the other direction. And yet: I remember walking to Latin IV—a.k.a. Publius Virgilius Maro, Virgilius &amp; Vergil 101—after finishing up my Microbiology &amp; Man midterm. I had spent the entire two days previous studying for the midterm and had barely had time to skim through the third book of the Georgics. I prided myself on always being prepared for my classes, so I seriously considered bailing. But there were only five of us in the class, so my skipping would put serious pressure on the other students, and I considered two of them close friends. So I put all truant thought..." />

					<a id="more"></a>
			<div class="entry-more">
				<p>I remember walking to Latin IV—<em>a.k.a. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil">Publius Virgilius Maro</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil">Virgilius</a> &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil">Vergil</a> 101</em>—after finishing up my <em>Microbiology &amp; Man</em> midterm.&nbsp; I had spent the entire two days previous studying for the midterm and had barely had time to skim through the third book of the <em>Georgics</em>.&nbsp; I prided myself on always being prepared for my classes, so I seriously considered bailing.&nbsp; But there were only five of us in the class, so my skipping would put serious pressure on the other students, and I considered two of them close friends.&nbsp; So I put all truant thought from mind, downed a quart of coffee and went to class unprepared.</p>

<p>Our professor walked in, looked us over, and seemed to realize that midterms had made our minds slag before remembering she didn't care:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Cold-reading quiz.&nbsp; Put away your notes and translate the following passage.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>As she read out the line numbers, my caffeinated but b-b-b-b-benumbed mind sc-sc-sc-sc-scanned the p-p-p-p-page—like a sprinter running full-bore, beating his personal best, but over uneven terrain, cluttered with cartoon rakes, eager to pop him in, his full-bore-personal-best face—and I found <em>anthrax</em>.&nbsp; Sure, I should've been translating Virgil, but what can I say?&nbsp; I found <em>anthrax</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>To death at once whole heards of cattle go;
<br />Sheep, oxen, horses, fall; and heaped on high,
<br />The differing species in confusion lie,
<br />Till, warned by their loathsome carrion under ground;
<br />For useless to the currier were their hides;
<br />Nor could their tainted flesh with ocean tides
<br />Be free from filth ...
<br />Nor safely could they shear their fleecy store
<br />(Made drunk with poisonous juice, and stiff with gore),
<br />Or touch the web: but if the vest they wear,
<br />Red blisters rising on their paps appear,
<br />And flaming carbuncles, and noisome sweat,
<br />And clammy dews, that loathsome lice beget;
<br />Till the slow-creeping evil eats his way,
<br />Consumes the parching limbs, and makes the life his prey.</p></blockquote><p>

Now, this isn't <em>quite</em> the translation I produced that day; nor, for that matter, is it necessarily an <em>accurate</em> one.&nbsp; It is, however, the one I found reading Berton Rouche's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452265886/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Medical Detectives</em></a> yesterday, which reminded me of that day, long before I became an English major, when my weakness for psychoanalytic <em>ex post facto</em> first revealed itself ...</p>

And remember to be early at Mr. St. Clair's [tea]; we must make it a success.&quot; &quot;And the Leighs?&quot; [says the narrator]. &quot;They will come; and now go and repent of your having been cross to Fred Vincent's wife&quot; [says Fred Vincent's wife, inexplicably referring to herself in the third person]. [The narrator] looked at her reproachfully. &quot;Oh, but you were, and you would have liked to be still more unpleasant. Good-by.&quot; This elicited a giggle: &quot;Yes; I am asked to go South on a Government commission to study the outbreak [of yellow fever] they have had. I think I shall go. I saw it once before, and for some reasons, no one else is quite as well fitted for this not over-pleasant task&quot; [says the narrator]. &quot;It is risky&quot; [says the narrator's poet-friend]. &quot;Very.&quot; &quot;I would n't go. What 's the use?&quot; &quot;It is a simple duty. I should like to go away for a while, and it fits in nicely.&quot; &quot;Darn duty.&quot; I laughed, as if darning duty mended matters, and we parted. See what I've been reduced to? After burning, Miriam-like, through five such novels the past five days, I'm increasingly tolerant of bad puns, witless cutting insults and the nimble plotting of the club-handed. Before you can say &quot;Spelling,&quot; I'll find Desperate Housewives clever, watch ER religiously and argue the literary merits of Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Works outside the canon may be, as my betters have argued, of historical import—but sometimes neglected works have been abandoned with good reason. I dread the day someone says &quot;I read X, Y or Z on the strength of your article,&quot; as I'm a man of peace and can do nothing to arrest the pummelling I've earned. I mean, I could plead professionalism: &quot;You don't understand! Appreciative criticism isn't appreciated in academia! Not the face! Not the face!&quot; But why heap humiliation on hospitalization?</span></a></div>
