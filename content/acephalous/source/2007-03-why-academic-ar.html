		<span id="comment-62876500-content"><p>It may not work within an academic article, but I think that it&#39;s a valid poetic technique.  I often write something that has some element of politics-of-the-moment in it, knowing that by the time anyone reads the poem, the moment will have passed.  But that gets away from the presumption that political poetry is supposed to have an effect as such, and universalizes it.  Because the truth is that decades later the same thing will probably be happening in some form.  The &quot;War of the Gulf&quot; is many wars, after all.</p>

<p>Well, at least I think that the technique would work if I could write better poetry.  Here&#39;s a sample that attempts to use specificity-within-universality (written before the Abu Ghraib scandal broke, I think):</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Hostage Crisis</p>

<p><br />
Captured<br />
The woman and child<br />
Held by strangers who don’t even know their language<br />
Are political pawns<br />
The leader of their guards,<br />
The colonel,<br />
Leaves a ransom note<br />
“If you want your family released, turn yourself in”<br />
The guards laugh, salute</p>

<p>When the husband shows up<br />
The colonel boasts to the media<br />
-- We got the criminal from the old regime! --<br />
And they publish it<br />
Job well done, soldier</p>

<p>No surprise it worked<br />
Who’d want to leave their wife and daughter in Abu Ghraib?<br />
The colonel smiles, gazes fondly at Old Glory<br />
How I love this country</p>

<p>Another day, another hostage crisis<br />
Seems they might not yet be ready for democracy</p>

<p>If we are very lucky<br />
Then there is no God to judge us</p></span>

		<span id="comment-62892448-content"><p>Scott - I&#39;m curious if you could spell out your objection a bit more here?  I&#39;m not asking this because I... er... object to the objection, but because I&#39;ve been wrestling with the issue of how distilled my own formal writing often is, when much of the provocation for my thought is often quite embedded and contextual.  On the one hand, distilled writing abstracted from the various idiosyncratic concerns that led the author to those particular ideas has the benefit of exposing the ideas to readers who are unlikely to share the same experiences - making it possible to test the validity of the ideas in a broader context.  On the other hand, it tends to present an odd picture of how thought unfolds - a picture that, I sometimes worry, can help convince readers that the production of ideas occurs in some rarified and disconnected realm, difficult for most people to access...  At any rate - mainly random musings, and perhaps not at all related to your reaction to this passage.  I was just curious...</p></span>

		<span id="comment-62926052-content"><p>Adam and CR, chill with the chilling!  </p>

<p>Constructivist, money being what it is right now, all I can offer is this bag of sticks.  (C.O.D., obviously.)  I haven&#39;t read much recent Emerson criticism, actually, but it&#39;s because (<i>wait for it... wait for it...</i>) I <b>really</b> dislike reading Emerson.  His prose has a soporific effect on me, which is strange, since I mostly adore (<i>mostly</i>) long mellifluous sentences.  </p>

<p>Rich, it certainly is a valid poetic technique -- and given the tenor of this article, that may justify its inclusion.  Maybe the fault is mine, then, inasmuch as I read the article as I would a work of criticism, when it&#39;s really more of a Benjaminian riff.</p>

<p>N.P., for the most part, what bothers me about it is the casualness, the looseness of the referent and its potential to trivialize a work.  I mean, we all know that we write in a fraught world; but the world&#39;s always been fraught, the pressure of the present&#39;s always acted upon us.  We can either treat that as we would our subject -- with the careful attention to detail it&#39;s afforded in our work -- or we can write an article for our immediate audience.  (Which, given the speed of academic publishing, is little more than a guarantee of immediate obsolescence.)  </p></span>

I linked to this song in my comment on the Benjamin thread, but it's so moving I'm going to link to it again: Modest Mouse - &quot;Dashboard&quot; [mp3] As Acephalous is neither Pitchfork nor Pirate Bay , I'll neither review nor link to the entire album.

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/anatomy_of_a_sp.html"><span><strong>Anatomy of a Splash: Don't Fear the Blog</strong> I've had a couple of interesting email exchanges of late with academics who want to blog, but fear the commitment required to find and retain an audience. In case any of you lurkers have similar questions, I thought I'd share my Words of Wisdom: You blog when you want to. Sometimes you'll fear disappointing your audience, but you shouldn't. We live in the age of Real Simple Syndication, which means even if you go dormant, people will know when you start blogging again. This is the Timothy Burke model: he disappears for a few weeks, comes back with a couple of great posts, then disappears again. You do not have to post five times a day. You can follow the Acephalous model and post once a day. Posting once a day has pleasant side effects: foremost among them, a backlog of potential posts (which I keep in a drafts folder and mine fairly frequently). Think of it like this: you gain an audience by making a splash. Throwing a thousand individual pebbles makes for a thousand tiny splashes. No one will notice. Hire a wrecking crew and chunk a few boulders in there and everyone will notice. So, write a few great posts, have them linked to by the right people, and you'll find yourself with an audience. Sinthome's a good example of this (although lately he's chucking individual boulders in four times daily). If you write something you know another blogger will find interesting, by all means, send an email. If you merely think they will, however, hold off. Of the links I'm emailed, only about half of them are of any real interest to me. Another quarter are pseudo-spam sent by people who email all the Marauding Marsupials with links to their poorly-scribed political screeds or the latest update on their vanity project of dubious value. But I take the time to read the rest and comment when I have something to say. (That said, I love those sorts of emails, so feel free to send me more.) I don't link to nearly enough of them—or in a timely manner—but that's the fault of the aforementioned backlog. (Still, I really ought to link to those items which really get me thinking, like CR's recent meditation on Barthes.) If you have any more questions, feel free to ask in the comments or send me an email.</span></a></div>
