        <meta name="description" content="The earliest example of the phrase &quot;the Great American Novel&quot; available in any of the databases I can access online occurs in T.S. Perry's 1873 review of &quot;American Novels&quot; in The North American Review. Of course, given the context of the occurance, I'm not entirely sure it's the first: We have often wondered that the people who raise the outcry for the &quot;Great American Novel&quot; did not see that, so far from being of any assistance to our fellow-countryman who is trying to win fame by writing fiction, they have rather stood in his way by setting up before him a false aim for his art, and by giving the critical reader a defective standard by which to judge his work. (366) Who are &quot;the people who raise the outcry for the 'Great American Novel'&quot;? According to an anonymous critic writing in The Aldine (also in 1873), they are Those who, since the days of Cooper, Irving, Hawthorne, the lamented Theodore Winthrop, and the publication of Mrs. Stowe's famous story, have been impatiently waiting for &quot;the great American novel,&quot; without knowing exactly what they want or expect. (188) This anonymous reviewer assures &quot;them&quot; that &quot;they may indulge in fresh hope since there are indications that, in the fullness of time, it will be forthcoming&quot; (ibid.). So &quot;they&quot; have waited well-nigh 70 years for a novel whose defining characteristics &quot;they&quot; can't fathom. But it will, &quot;they&quot; declaim, be American. &quot;There is an American nature,&quot; Perry insisted, but &quot;then there is human nature underlying it, and to that the novel must be true before anything else&quot; (366). So the great American novel must first be &quot;great&quot; before it should even worry about it being &quot;American.&quot; That sounds like a reasonable enough proposition, unless there's something about being an American that precludes one from writing &quot;great&quot; literature. (More on that in a moment.) What it manifestly could not be, all the critics writing in 1873 concurred, is an English or French ship sailing under American colors. But these critics also concur on the problem with writing a &quot;great&quot; novel about Americans: American life. As Perry says, &quot;the very uniformity of our social life would offer nothing tempting to the writer, unless, indeed, to the satirist&quot; (374). American English is so comically artless, Perry argues, that any attempt to depict it would sound satirical to educated readers even if it were not intended as such. So Americans can't be allowed to speak like Americans in the Great American Novel, but neither are they to speak like the British; American authors, it seems, are too unfamiliar with British locution to ape it successfully. When they try it sounds satirical. An example from Sylvester Judd's Margaret will prove this point: &quot;This is a fine mineralogical region,&quot; said he, as they entered the spot. &quot;I wish I had a hammer!&quot; &quot;I will get one!&quot; she said. &quot;Let me go for it now!&quot; &quot;You are not in health, you told me, and you do not look very strong...." />

			<p>The earliest example of the phrase &quot;the Great American Novel&quot; available in any of the databases I can access online occurs in T.S. Perry's 1873 review of &quot;American Novels&quot; in <em>The North American Review</em>.&nbsp; Of course, given the context of the occurance, I'm not <em>entirely </em>sure it's the first:</p><blockquote><p>We have often wondered that the people who raise the outcry for the &quot;Great American Novel&quot; did not see that, so far from being of any assistance to our fellow-countryman who is trying to win fame by writing fiction, they have rather stood in his way by setting up before him a false aim for his art, and by giving the critical reader a defective standard by which to judge his work.

(188)</p></blockquote><p>This anonymous reviewer assures &quot;them&quot; that &quot;they may indulge in fresh hope since there are indications that, in the fullness of time, it will be forthcoming&quot; (<em>ibid.</em>).&nbsp; So &quot;they&quot; have waited well-nigh 70 years for a novel whose defining characteristics &quot;they&quot; can't fathom.&nbsp; But it will, &quot;they&quot; declaim, be <em>American</em>.&nbsp; &quot;There is an American nature,&quot; Perry insisted, but &quot;then there is human nature underlying it, and to that the novel must be true before anything else&quot; (366).&nbsp; So the great American novel must first be &quot;great&quot; before it should even worry about it being &quot;American.&quot;&nbsp; That sounds like a reasonable enough proposition, unless there's something about being an American that precludes one from writing &quot;great&quot; literature.&nbsp; (More on that in a moment.)&nbsp; What it manifestly could not be, all the critics writing in 1873 concurred, is an English or French ship sailing under American colors.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But these critics also concur on the problem with writing a &quot;great&quot; novel about Americans: American life.&nbsp; As Perry says, &quot;the very uniformity of our social life would offer nothing tempting to the writer, unless, indeed, to the satirist&quot; (374). American English is so comically artless, Perry argues, that any attempt to depict it would sound satirical to educated readers even if it were not intended as such.&nbsp; So Americans can't be allowed to speak like Americans in the Great American Novel, but neither are they to speak like the British; American authors, it seems, are too unfamiliar with British locution to ape it successfully.&nbsp; When they try it sounds satirical.&nbsp; An example from Sylvester Judd's <em>Margaret </em>will prove this point:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This is a fine mineralogical region,&quot; said he, as they entered the spot.&nbsp; &quot;I wish I had a hammer!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will get one!&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;Let me go for it now!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are not in health, you told me, and you do not look very strong.&nbsp; I must go by all means!&nbsp; I will be back in a trice.&quot;</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>&quot;See this,&quot; said he, exposing a hollow stone filled with rare crystals.</p>

<p>&quot;I thank you, I thank you!&quot; she replied.&nbsp; &quot;The master has given me an inkling of geology, but I never imagined such beauty was hidden here!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With definite forms and brilliant textures these gems vegetate in the centre of this rough rusty stone!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Incomparable mystery!&nbsp; New anagogics!&nbsp; I begin to be in love with what I understand not!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Satire indeed.&nbsp; So what is an American author writing in 1873 who wants to write the Great American Novel to do?&nbsp; Best to sit out until the next Presidential election.&nbsp; Maybe then the American people will elect someone able to fulfill Perry's prophecy: &quot;possibly with good Presidents and a proper tariff,&quot; he propounds, migth come &quot;an American Shakespeare&quot; (369).&nbsp; (Don't look for direct causality: it isn't there.)&nbsp; But instead of a good President, the Americans elected Grant.&nbsp; </p>

<p>No one talked about the Great American Novel from 1873 until 1883.&nbsp; Apparently Rutherford B. Hayes lacked whatever quality compels people to talk about the Great American Novel.&nbsp; Not that writers stopped trying.&nbsp; Henry Adams' subtitled his anonymously published novel, <em>Democracy</em>, with the subtle <em>An American Novel</em>.&nbsp; It may've been American, and it may've been a Novel, but alas! it was not Great.</p>

<p>In 1883, James Garfield, er, Chester Arthur had the country a-buzz with talk of writing the Great American Novel.&nbsp; Perhaps the American people felt liberated by the death of that quintessential American, Ralph Waldo Emerson.&nbsp; No longer would their characters, by dint of Emerson's awesome Americanness, be stalked by the gigantic eyeballs which imparted to all American literature a disturbing gothic flair.&nbsp; (Imagine how much better Isabel Archer would have fared with her suitors were it not for the enormous floating eye behind her!)&nbsp; </p>

<p>But then it was discovered that the Great American Novel had already been written.&nbsp; Only it was a romance.&nbsp; Three romances, actually: <em>The Blithedale Romance</em>,&nbsp; <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, and <em>The House of Seven Gables</em>.&nbsp; That all these romances are Hawthorne's is incidental: one critic &quot;take[s] leave to say, that if I draw illustrations from this particular writer, it is for no other reason than that he presents, more forcibly than most, a method of dealing with the special problem [America] we are considering&quot; (174).&nbsp; At the news of this discovery, throngs of problematic Americans filled streets devoid of History to celebrate the young critical genius: &quot;Julian!&quot; the young ladies cried uncouthly, &quot;Juuuuuuulian!&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Then Julian Hawthorne awoke to the realization that no one in his right mind would consider him an impartial source on the matter.&nbsp; So the search for the Great American Novel continued, and despite Julian Hawthorne's best efforts, most eyes were turned to the future.&nbsp; At least they did once they recovered from whatever struck them.&nbsp; Struck them with what?&nbsp; I don't know, but whatever it was, it was such that no one would really mention the Great American Novel until 1889.&nbsp; Why these gaps?&nbsp; </p>

<p>That will be the subject of tomorrow's essay.&nbsp; To whet your appetite: young Master Julian may have been correct: the Great American Novel may still vegetate like a gem in the rough rusty rock of American life.&nbsp; Also, there will be a wedding.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And a murder.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And a birth.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A terrible, terrible birth.</p>

		<span id="comment-7381472-content"><p>Some of the gaps may have to do with how the search phrases work. For example, during the gap from 1873-1883 there was <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/ncpsbib:@field(DOCID+@lit(ABK2934-0037-83_bib))::" rel="nofollow">an article</a> in <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em> of April 1876 that began:</p>

<blockquote>The problem of writing American
novels, about which it has of late years
become the fashion to talk with a great
deal of artificial profundity and useless
intricacy, is not a new one. Some of
the prevalent theories about it are fort-
unately new; but the attempt to solve
the difficulty began more than three
quarters of a century ago.</blockquote>

<p>but it does not seem to use the actual phrase &quot;great american novel.&quot;</p>

<p><br />
And the <em>Blithedale Romance</em> is great, by the way, although most of my students didn&#39;t seem to like it.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-7382226-content"><p>eb, first, refering to you as &quot;E.B.&quot; makes me feel like I&#39;m on <i>Deadwood</i>, and that if I don&#39;t spout a string of language most vile and sincere, that I&#39;ll somehow upset the order of the universal.  Second, there&#39;s a lot of chatter about what constitutes <i>an</i> American novel, but from what I can tell, there are these strange bursts when people start talking, almost exclusively, about <i>the Great</i> American novel.  This is a sketch of some initial research--with some absurd commentary on my part--of what may become a larger research project.  I can&#39;t quite figure the cause of these sporadic demands for greatness of some monolithic American sort, but I aim to.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mind <i>Blithedale</i>, but what I didn&#39;t quote is Julian&#39;s discussion of how <i>The Marble Faun</i> may be the Great Italian Novel.  Nor will I, as it will entail me thinking about <i>The Marble Faun</i> again, and I&#39;ve already done that far, far too much today.  (Yes, the time it took me to type this constitutes far, far too much.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-7399346-content"><p>Well, there is the whole issue of whether anything truly great, in European terms, can be produced in a democratic society. De Tocqueville (aside: after years of seeing people cite him now I know what it feels like to be one of those people who quotes de Tocqueville) comes back to this theme a lot: true greatness requires lofty ambition, and lofty ambitions seem to be created more in highly stratified societies than in democratic/egalitarian ones. So if America embodies democracy itself then it&#39;s going to have a problem producing high culture. The creation of Great American Novels would go a long way towards disproving the ideas of those elitist naysayers across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>This actually comes up in the context of slavery too; I think one of Fitzhugh&#39;s defences of slave societies like ancient greece is that they produced the kind of greatness in thought (and possibly in art, too - I don&#39;t remember) that America should strive to emulate.</p>

<p>Also, not having watched any of <em>Deadwood</em> I appreciate your restraint.</p></span>

They's Numbers!</strong> In &quot;Presentism,&quot; Graham Good argues that Francis Fukuyama's brilliant Hegelian work called The End of History was dismissed unread by most theorists despite (or because of) its offer of a coherent and persuasive vision of where we are in human history. If any further justification were needed for the dismissal, it was provided by the news that Fukuyama worked fro the U.S. State Department. So why bother with study, argument or disproof? (288). For reasons unclear to me then--and still murky to me now--I didn't buy it. I'd seen too many serious engagements with Fukuyama's argument for Good's claim to be true. So I did some fact-checking of the cursory but thorough sort beloved by bloggers everywhere. Here are the results: A general search of JSTOR reveals 653 citations of Fukuyama's The End of History. Limit the database to &quot;Language &amp; Literature,&quot; and you're left with 57. &quot;Not bad!&quot; you yell? (Self-congratulation is so becoming.) Considering that the &quot;Language &amp; Literature&quot; is one of the four largest sub-groups in the database (63 journals to History's 57, Business' 59 and Economics' 40), that means the vast majority of citations of Fukuyama appear in other fields. So how seriously have the folks who study &quot;Language &amp; Literature&quot; taken one of the most influential theories--ideological inclinations notwithstanding--of the past 15 years? Well, they're not doing too well in terms of pure numbers. But maybe the literary scholars who take the time to challenge his argument do so seriously. A quick tour: Social Text's editorial board loves to publish articles that bash Fukuyama. To wit: David Scott argues that &quot;Fukuyama's thesis (such as it is) is simply that the changes and transformations taking place around the world today ... should not be seen as isolated, contingent events&quot; (12). Further condemnation: &quot;it may be felt, rightly or wrongly, that The End of History, elegant and learned as it may appear, is merely the work of the U.S. State Department ideologue and therefore hardly worth reflecting on&quot; (14). Scott's evalution (such as it is) is simply dismissive, merely the work of a Social Text ideologue and hardly worth reflecting on. In Specters of Marx, Derrida calls The End of History and the Last Man &quot;the grammar school exercise of a young, industrious, but come-lately reader of Kojeve&quot; who possesses a &quot;sophisticated naivete&quot; and a neoconservative &quot;evangelism&quot; (56, 62). Judith Butler doesn't diss so much as dismiss Fukuyama as Kojeve-lite, then says this about &quot;their&quot; theory: &quot;On the contrary, in a sense that will become important to interrogate, the unrealizability of the end of history is precisely what guarantees futurity, for if history were to have an end, a telos, and if that end were knowable in the present, then the future would be known in advance of its emergence, and the futrue would be always already present&quot; (4). This is a stunningly general argument: if we know exactly will happen, then the &quot;future&quot; is in some sense &quot;present.&quot; As in: if I throw a ball up...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/life_among_the_.html"><span><strong>Life among the Bhabhatistas: a Memoir in the Key of Clatter, for Dry Bones and Cello</strong> Brad Delong complains of the noise my dry bones make when they clatter. Then he sprints below decks and stands, in the boiler room, at the contact point, before the mast. (I'm relieved his metaphor's metaphorical: I would pity the crew quartered in the boiler room.) He says: Over at The Valve, they are talking about the book Theory's Empire--and thus about the damage done by &quot;Critical Theory&quot; and its spawn on the American humanities over the past generation. But most of it is all too... theoretical. What work can you do with statements like... ...and then he quotes, among other things, the second half of the fourth paragraph of my contribution as an example of the bloodlessness of the Valve's critique of Theory. Now, DeLong is sharp on matters economic, but if his reading of my essay's typical of his analysis of all matters outside economics, then I applaud his decision to stick to his strengths. On what grounds, if not logical, would he have literary critics confront the excesses of more Theoretically-minded critics? My essay, as you know, fingers the decline of rigorous thought as the motive force behind the rise of Theory in the humanities. And I argue my point, if you please, rigorously. But rigor and logic are bloodless, whereas invective is sanguifluous. In Timothy and Sean's posts, the streets run crimson as the life runs from the things which late were Theories. Those posts excel where mine fail: they make sweeping arguments designed to appeal to those who are already convinced of Theory's vacuity. In other words, they have the rhetorical flair which appeals to someone who, like DeLong, dismisses Theory as so much blather. And some of it is. However, no one who practices one or another of the regnant Theories will read Timothy or Sean's posts and reevaluate their life's work. They will recognize, in both, the hostility that they and theirs have (admittedly) earned. But it still reads hostile, and it's still likely to be ignored. Consider an example: Sean and Timothy are Generals in the War Against Theory. All available intelligence points to a battalion of Bhabhatistas hiding in the Deconstructed Zone. On the eve of battle, General McCann delivers a rousing condemnation of the Bhabhatistas. General Burke follows suit. The troops, intoxicated by the rhetoric, grab their gear and prepare for the assault. Sounds about right to me. But what would happen if Covert Operative McCann delivered that same condemnation to Bhabhatistas he bunks with? How long before the life begins running from the rapidly de-sanguinating body of poor C.O. McCann? Not long at all. So C.O. McCann, knowing his intentions and his audience, would probably choose to encourage defection by other means. &quot;We have the logic,&quot; he mouths to a bunk-mate. &quot;But, the Bhabha said...&quot; &quot;Forget about the Bhabha!&quot; he whispers with a vehemence belying volume. &quot;The Bhabha lied. Logic is real...&quot; &quot;...The Logic is The Real?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; McCann mumbles. &quot;Logic is real. As in 'it exists.'&quot; &quot;Oh, I...</span></a></div>
