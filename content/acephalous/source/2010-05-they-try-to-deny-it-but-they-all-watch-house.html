<p>Now I understand why you don&#39;t blame graduate school for you &#39;eventful&#39; life....</p>

<p><i>The YOUNG DOCTOR looks at SEK, scowls, then exits the &quot;room&quot; and tells the nurse to send NEW DOCTOR in to help him.</i></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t realize until recently that a doctor could do that: give up on a patient because we&#39;re &#39;difficult.&#39; I saw a <i>surgeon</i> do it when he couldn&#39;t answer basic questions to the satisfaction of non-doctors and we had the temerity to <i>keep asking questions</i>. It&#39;s grossly unprofessional behavior. But it has the benefit of removing incompetents from your care team, so I suppose it&#39;s not entirely without merit.</p></span>

Justin would agree with this.  As far as the doctor goes, yes even if you are paying a doctor can refuse to care for you or you can request another doctor.  The issue is not reading history and thinking you have all the answers. With complex histories having a written up history that you carry with you is important.  Having a list of ALL meds.,including over-the-counter stuff is a must.  This gives a doctor or anyone treating you with an instant look into your medical issues.  This can prevent undue testing and provide a jumping point that cut to the chase.  A doctor know what you are taking and what you know are issues and can lead to a pleace that only concerns the present. You know where to go quickly and what you can rule out easily.  This helps cut costs and saves time.    Anyway, that is my thought on the medical issue.  Doctors are not GOD and yet, we still try to treat them as such even when we are paying the bill.</p></span>

The real truth lies in the little electronic pads they are never without.  Thes are used to let others on duty that they have no clue to what is worng with the patient, who just now looks like he is dying. And yes Scott gets his  &#39;telling tales&quot; ability from his mom.<br />
And watch the nurses because they know more and can help more. They often tell the MDswhat to do.  They can also move the MDs in the right direction.I know I was a very healthy woman until we moved south to a land I really love, but I seem to be spending more time and money seeking cures from this diease slowly taking my life.<br />
And phones today can be used in most places in hospitals because of new technology. Thats how doctors keep up with patients and MDs can carry around info which he can get instant results from.   It&#39;s like Windows 7. I just love it. With that said I will now go to sleep so I can get to the hospital in the morning for some testing on myself before I fly to Cal.Like mother, like Son.  Love, Mom</p></span>

<p>There&#39;s no question whatsoever that you wrote it, in style, content or origin. While your new medication regimen may have produced some short-term memory loss, it clearly didn&#39;t diminish your linguistic or stylistic abilities nor, unless I&#39;m missing something, lower your inhibitions to write something you would normally have hidden or otherwise redacted. </p>

<p>As far as being a &#39;warning&#39; to future writers, I think the only message is this: have a style and method well polished before attempting public writing <i>in extremis</i>. </p></span>
