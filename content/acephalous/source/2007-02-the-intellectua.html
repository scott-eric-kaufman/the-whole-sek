As Todd McGowan [JSTOR] notes, the emphasis on the gaze in film studies has pushed the third element of the Lacanian triad, the Real, past the vanishing point, a “crucial omission, because the Real provides the key to understanding the radical role that the gaze plays within filmic experience.” Doing justice neither to the art object under examination nor the examining theory, the routinization of “the gaze” in film studies speaks to the intellectual deficit caused by professional isolation.

		<span id="comment-28631564-content"><p>I have often wondered what &quot;gaze theory&quot; would say about directors like Tartovsky, Herzog, and Malick, whose lenses seem often to answer the demands of neither self-reflection nor desire, but instead obsessively focus on what the director believes is the Real. Maybe this speaks more to my own favorite films than to the bulk of what is made. When I was an undergrad studying film, T, H, and M somehow seemed beside the point, not useful as texts underlying film theory. Now, they&#39;re incredibly helpful to me for understanding poetry.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-28631604-content"><p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re wrong.  It seems symptomatic of a larger problem with lazy applications of Theory, which is the tendency to treat all theories one agrees with as settled questions.  Like, &quot;You&#39;re talking about the study of history, but Nietzsche already showed the problems with that&quot; (this jerk, almost-actual quote).  Without continual debate, development, and modification, theories inevitably calcify into mere cliché, useful only as &quot;food for thought.&quot;</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t I read somewhere  Oh yeah, it was in the Properties of a Dinosaur Comic: <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=859." rel="nofollow">http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=859.</a>  Sources don&#39;t get any more reliable than that.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-28631943-content"><p>Tired after a long day of teaching, but I&#39;ll try to make some comments here.  I think this account probably overstates Lacan&#39;s influence on film studies to some extent, especially over the last decade, but I could be ignoring some of my own unconscious biases.  I certainly teach Mulvey, and her essay helped to shape one of the major debates in the field (about how spectators are positioned), but one of the major strains of film scholarship--the cognitivist approach advocated by Bordwell and Thompson--operates from much different assumptions about film spectators and how they watch films.  There&#39;s also quite a bit of work inspired/influenced by Bourdieu and others that focuses on audience behaviors  and activities, etc.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t really comment on Roberts&#39; essay specifically, unfortunately, because I haven&#39;t read it.  I do find Macgowan&#39;s re-reading of Lacan fairly convincing, but I think a lot of film scholars would be suspicious of relatively sloppy homologies between film watching and the mirror stage.  Again, I&#39;m pretty sleepy, so I may be missing something.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-28632149-content"><p>I don&#39;t have enough context on this, not having read the Roberts essay -- but don&#39;t sufficiently influential theories within the humanites become self-fulfilling prophecies?  If Mulvey&#39;s idea has been so highly cited, then it&#39;s certainly influenced film criticism and possibly influenced filmmakers.  Like Freudianism, it may have assumed a folk-pyschological reality that exists as a social belief whether the &quot;science&quot; is bogus or not.  (I used to write folk-psychoanalytic instead of folk-psychological, but that led to too many questions.)</p>

<p>So in that sense, her ideas are now important, however challenged, whether they were originally right or not.</p></span>

<p>If psychoanalysis is so dead, why all the work on trauma, mourning, loss this past decade--and not just from a Lacanian perspective?  There are incredibly vibrant debates among multiple psychoanlytic traditions on these concepts, as well as from cognitive scientists, filmmakers, writers, poststructuralists, marxists, postcolonialists, critical race theorists, etc.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-28633215-content"><p>Constructivist, your comment brings up once again the question of a distinction between folk-psychology and folk-psychoanalysis.  Trauma, mourning, and loss are generally considered to human universals; it&#39;s not like psychoanalysis discovered them.  Psychoanalysis got to set the modern framework through which they are perceived, though, so that now one can refer to trauma, mourning, loss and automatically think that psychoanalytic theories are relevant.  But psychoanalysis could be dead, and trauma, mourning, and loss would not disappear from human experience, from art, or from reactions to art.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-28704218-content"><p>I am certain that Mulvey&#39;s argument holds for many films, by many filmmakers, not because of transcendent universals, but because of the way the medium has evolved historically.</p>

<p>For example, every single discussion I have heard about <i>Casino Royale</i> has involved the voyeuristic gaze, particularly since the film semi-seriously makes Bond (as well as his girls, the traditional objects of desire) subject to the gaze.</p>

<p>Likewise the narcissistic gaze: there is tons of evidence (for example, in dozens of hip-hop songs) that the Al Pacino film <i>Scarface</i> continues to be interpreted narcissistically. Likewise <i>Legally Blonde</i>, most Tarantino films, and various acclaimed television shows (including <i>Buffy</i> and <i>The Sopranos</i>).</p>

<p>It is true that desire doesn&#39;t work the same way in Herzog or Malick (I haven&#39;t seen anything by Tarkovsky). It may not work the same way in Kieslowski, either. However, it is still desire of some sort, and voyeurism of some sort -- how can one overlook the desire in <i>Wings of Desire</i>, the voyeurism of the angel&#39;s melancholy visions of a humanity from which he is excluded? Meanwhile, a film like <i>The Thin Red Line</i> is suffused with yearning for God. This spirituality is also a yearning for the Real (the capitalization seems particularly appropriate), but then arguably so is the more earthly yearning of voyeuristic carnality.</p></span>

<p>&quot;Without continual debate, development, and modification, theories inevitably calcify into mere cliché, useful only as &quot;food for thought.&quot;</p>

<p>I wonder if this might be good reason for &#39;wild scholarship&#39;, scholarship which intentionally sets out to ignore it&#39;s predecessors. It wouldn&#39;t work if it was the norm but occasionally &quot;cultivating naivety&quot; as my favourite science fiction author Frank Herbert put it might be edifying. As he put it there is no better impediment to learning new things than an accumulation of “things I know”. <br />
