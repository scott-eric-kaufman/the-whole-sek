			<p>Reading through my feeds on a lazy Sunday morning, I came across Cory Doctorow's <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/07/15/pocket_paper_enginee.html">declaration of love</a> to Caron Barton's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Paper Pocket Engineer</em></a>:</p>

<p>Doctorow loves &quot;grown-up uses for popups&quot;?&nbsp; I thought he'd sworn undying devotion to <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/05/03/alice_in_wonderland_.html"><em>Alice in Wonderland</em> dishes</a>; or was it <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2001/08/30/the_wombles_of_wimbl.html"><em>The Wombles of Wimbleton Common</em></a>?&nbsp; I have it all wrong: Doctorow's one and only is <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/12/08/ubuntu_for_nongeeks.html">Stinkpad</a>, or maybe <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/16/transmetropolitan_1_.html"><em>Transmetropolitan</em></a>.&nbsp; No, I remember now, his heart belongs to <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2001/08/24/the_roadtools_guys_s.html">Podium CoolPads</a> or <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2003/04/14/waterproof_cases_for.html">waterproof cases for Exilim cameras</a>, one or the other, unless you count <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/02/12/new_album_of_beatles.html">The Beastles' <em>Let It Beast</em></a>, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/30/quicksilver_better_t.html"><em>Quicksilver</em></a>, or <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/23/wicked_rss_reader_re.html"><em>Shrook</em> 2.0</a>. </p>

<p>Pressed to choose, I'm sure <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2003/02/20/disney_ephemera_thro.html">vintage Disney ephemera</a> would be his true, mad, total squeeze. </p>

<p>Not that he ever will be, mind you.&nbsp; Doctorow's a <em>lover</em>, not &quot;The Decider.&quot;</p>

<p>You know, Scott, maybe the Internet is just too both/and for you; it is a place for the expression of a plenitude of loves, unfettered by the exclusivity of love in the singular. </p>

<p>...or maybe Doctorow just likes distracting shiny things. </p>

<p>PS why does my Bloglines keep updating saying you have 33 or 102 new posts every few hours, but then you don&#39;t?</p></span>

I spent my youth swiping and selling back balls from <a href="http://www.ccofla.com/CCOFLA/home.aspx" rel="nofollow">The Country Club of Louisiana</a>, which later boasted both Master P and Snoop Dogg as members.  (Didn&#39;t swipe from them though, as I ain&#39;t stupid.  Although, now that I think about it, I think Snoop would&#39;ve respected me ganking his balls when he wasn&#39;t looking ... so long as the enterprise remained wholly literal, that is.)</p>

<p>Sisyphus, I don&#39;t doubt that Doctorow loves shiny things ... and had I the energy and salary, I&#39;d love shiny things too.  But it&#39;s odd for such a love to become standard, no?  I&#39;m being flip here only because I don&#39;t have time or thought enough to spare on all its implications, but such that it is, my argument would be that the fetishization of sleek stuff is as deleterious as any other, we merely miss it because of Doctorow&#39;s activism.  (I should say here that I&#39;ve exchanged a couple of emails with him, and there&#39;s no doubt in my mind as to his commitment ... I only wonder about the effect of his love on his many, many, many, many, many readers.)</p>

<p>As to why I seem to write so much according to Bloglines, well, I don&#39;t know.  It doesn&#39;t pick up all my drafts, does it?  (<em>he says, fear visible in his eyes</em>) </p></span>

<p>And since I usually pile up some quotes and then work backwards to figure out my point, I&#39;ll leave some handy quotes for you to spin into gold --- or Doctorow analysis --- yourself:</p>

<p>“In the flâneur the intelligentsia pays a visit to the marketplace, ostensibly to look around, yet in reality to find a buyer” (Walter Benjamin, “Paris, Capital of the Nineteenth Century”)</p>

<p>... ok the Foucault one about desires proliferating as sex is put into discourse isn&#39;t coming easily to hand. Have one quote then.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-76037332-content"><p>Doctorow&#39;s love for commercial ephemera is genuine and thoroughly self-aware. His signature short story was, after all, <a href="http://craphound.com/?p=140" rel="nofollow">&quot;Craphound&quot;</a>, and his parents are, after all, <a href="http://www.sfrevu.com/ISSUES/2003/0302/Feature%20Interview%20-%20Cory%20Doctorow/Interview.htm" rel="nofollow">academic Trotskyites</a>. I think he&#39;d agree with us that his idiosyncrasies match peculiarly well with the weblog form and some widespread habits of his online generation. I also think he&#39;s had more opportunity to think about what that means than we have, and so it might be worth bringing him into the discussion. My conversations with Cory have often included mutual exasperation, but I&#39;ve never found him to be thoughtless or inarticulate.</p>

<p>(As a preview of sorts, his view of my enthusiasm for high culture and pre-1950 literature didn&#39;t differ much in form from your view of his enthusiasm for plastic junk.)<br />

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/07/ae-housman-the-.html"><span><strong>A.E. Housman &amp; The Latin for Ass; or, the Kool Moe Dee to Our Busy Bees</strong> Hunting down the source of the Latin maxim with which Wharton closes &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;—&quot;labor est etiam ipsa voluptas&quot; (&quot;toil is itself a pleasure&quot;)—I came across numerous articles by A.E. Housman, best known to high-schoolers as the author of &quot;To An Athlete Dying Young.&quot; Regrettably, before tonight I knew little more about Housman now than I did in high school; by which I mean, it could've been summarized &quot;'we chaired you through the market-place' taught me how to verb.&quot; Now that I've become acquainted with him as a classical scholar, however, that's certain to change. If the below's indicative of his professional correspondence, I can't wait to read his letters. Perhaps this is well-known to all them what ain't rubes like me, but Housman tore his contemporaries new ones faster and harder and bigger than anyone this side of Stanley Fish. Strike that. His is the withering to which Fish-wit aspires. Consider his introduction to Juvenal: Frailty of understanding is in itself no proper target for scorn and mockery ... but the unintelligent forfeit their claim to compassion when they begin to indulge in self-complacent airs, and to call themselves sane critics, meaning they are mechanics. And when, relying on their numbers, they pass from self-complacency to insolence, and reprove their betters for using the brains which God has denied them, they dry up the fount of pity. (xiii.) W.M. Lindsay's shriveled riposte? If [Housman's] preface, in spite of the unfortunate1 style in which it is written ... 1 I suppose it is useless to express a wish that Mr. Housman would cease to speak about veteran scholars of eminence ... in that fashion. Fortunately for us, Lindsay's wish was useless. In the preface to his translation of Manilius' Astronomica, Housman first lights into Elias Stoeber of Strassburg, &quot;a city still famous for its geese&quot;: &quot;Stoeber's mind, though that is no name to call it by, was one which turned as unswervingly to the false, the meaningless, the unmetrical, and the ungrammatical, as the needle to the pole.&quot; (xix) A later translator, Friedrich Jacob, fairs no better: Not only had Jacob no sense for grammar, no sense for coherency, no sense for sense, but being himself possessed by a passion for the clumsy and the hispid he imputed this disgusting taste to all the authors whom he edited; and Manilius, the one Latin poet who exceeds even Ovid in verbal point and smartness, is accordingly constrained to write the sort of poetry which might have been composed by Nebuchadnezzar when he was driven from men and did eat grass as oxen. (xxi) As to how Jacob and Stoeber compared: In [Jacob's] short book, if only its vices are considered, is a scarce less woeful piece of work than Stoeber's: the difference is that while Stoeber never reminds one of a rational animal, the fog of Jacob's intellect is shot through, and not that seldom, by flashes of conspicuous and startling brilliancy. (xxii) Of the conservative critic, Housman opined: His...</span></a></div>
