<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>Why?</p>

<p><strong>Michael:&nbsp; </strong>What's it to you?</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>I kind of like the little fellow.&nbsp; He stole a pizza for us once.</p>

<p><strong>Michael:&nbsp; </strong>I can kick your ass too.</p>

<p><strong>Michael:&nbsp; </strong>For that fucker.&nbsp; (<em>He points at Trey.&nbsp; His pacing becomes more frantic.&nbsp; The attention spans of his posse begin to flag.</em>)&nbsp; I'm gonna kick his ass. </p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>Was that really necessary?</p>

<p><strong>Michael:&nbsp; </strong>Why don't you tell me.</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>Look.&nbsp; Let him sit down and eat his lunch.&nbsp; You can kick his ass some other time what with you being so manly and all.</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>I'm going to class.&nbsp; (<em>Scott decides not to go to class.&nbsp; Instead he walks to &quot;the black side of campus.&quot;&nbsp; The school itself may be desegregated but the student population isn't.&nbsp; Scott has black friends.&nbsp; One of them, Chester, was particularly protective of him and had told him that if he was ever in trouble to head towards the black side of campus.&nbsp; So Scott did.</em>)</p>

<p><strong>Michael:&nbsp; </strong>The fuck you are!&nbsp; (<em>The pre-fight crowd begins to gather.&nbsp; As Scott walks he can feel each addition to the group trailing him.&nbsp; What troubles him is the group beginning to form in front of him.&nbsp; If they form a circle around him and Michael before he reaches the black side of campus . . . then they do.&nbsp; Scott is now surrounded.&nbsp; He turns to face Michael.</em>)&nbsp; You stupid fucking pussy ass motherfucking ass-face pussy motherfucking son of a motherfucking bitch I will fuck you up!</p>

<p><strong>Scott:&nbsp; </strong>Why Michael, what a colorful vocabulary you have!</p>

<p><strong>Michael:&nbsp; </strong>Are you calling me a <em>nigger</em>?</p>

<p><em>The terrible beating Scott had already resigned himself to ensues.&nbsp; He should have known better.&nbsp; He did.&nbsp; But he has a big mouth.&nbsp; He knows you know that.&nbsp; He also knows that those of you who have heard this story before will think to themselves &quot;I think he normally tells it better.&nbsp; He left something crucial out.&quot;&nbsp; He thinks he did too . . . but he can't remember what it is.&nbsp; He wants you to feel free to inform him.&nbsp; Especially Jason since he both reads this blog and was there.&nbsp; And Zach and Jamie, who have both heard him tell this story before.&nbsp; He wants to perfect it for his bio-pic.&nbsp; It'll start with his time in New Jersey and Canada and move forward to his High School of Horrors before concluding with <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my_morning.html">His Infamous Morning</a> . . . </em></p>

For whatever reason I've been having a ball writing these little scenes. The quality will improve. I promise. Now for a couple of quick notes: First: I've a new post up on the Valve which contains roughly the first 80 percent of tomorrow night's public lecture. Read it and tell me what you think. Second: I sincerely thank the person who clicked on an Amazon link and purchased $1,432.91 in baby paraphernalia. That is by far the easiest $57.32 I've ever earned. Feel free to splurge on one of these , which you can roll up to this when you're not too busy watching this on one of these . Third: I'm thinking of a site redesign now that Acephalous is officially one year old. (I forgot to wish the old bird a happy birthday. I'd be a terrible parent.) Jonathan frequently complains about the colors of the text and body. I like them but he thinks they're unreadable. What about you? Would you prefer something more transparent? Or simply something different and easier on the eyes? Or is she fine as is?</span></a></div>
