<p>I.</p>

<p>Thanks to the passage of time, terrorism is now <a href="http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/ny-etterror4798234jun29,0,3907021.story?page=2&amp;coll=ny-entertainment-headlines">an acceptable novelistic subject</a>.&nbsp; Just don’t make it <em>Middle Eastern</em> terrorism, because according to Brad Thor, “We’re getting Islamic terrorist fatigue.”

old: “[In] an abundant society where people have laptops, cellphones,
iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod along with books. I
prefer to search library stacks because when I work to learn something,
I remember it.”
</p>
<p>
Film novelization is <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2144703">a dying art</a>, and that’s a shame, because “<em>Quadrophenia</em> [was] surprisingly good.”
</p>
<p>
Realism must <a href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/theo_hobson/2006/06/where_novelists_fear_to_tread.html">embrace fundamentalism</a> or risk losing its license.
</p>

Finally, the announcement of <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/abstractalous_m.html">my new project</a>, an attempt to create an abstract database for literary scholars.&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>II.</p>

<p>This week on Bill Moyer’s <a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/">Faith &amp; Reason</a>:

I hope to be back tomorrow. I was able to compose a semi-intelligent response to yesterday's post while hunkered in another, actually, the only air-conditioned room available. So there's that. Expect more when the air moves again. A couple quick confessions: The whole Freud thing devestates me. I knew he was wrong, but until now I didn't think him a fraud. That'll teach me to read people's letters or, you know, look past the face with which people countenance history. [Edited because one can't &quot;delve beyond&quot; a face. See what the heat does to otherwise sound heads?] Google has abandoned me. For some reason I lack the liquids to discover, Google will no longer index Acephalous. I'm not sure what I did, but I think it has something to do with that search box I added the other day. I did so because I found myself wanting to refer to things I'd previously written more and more and tired of having to do so the old-fashioned way. That'll teach me to, you know, do things to make my life easier.</span></a></div>

The reason for the &quot;again&quot; above, if you're curious.] Passage from a letter excerpted in Ernest Jone's The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (3:392): If I had my life to live over again, I should devote myself to telepathy rather than to psychoanalysis. To which I can only say this: What would the world look like if Freud had his druthers? What would theory debates look like? What claims made? I planned on outlining this all, but got so involved in the gimmick I'm too tired to make the joke.</span></a></div>
