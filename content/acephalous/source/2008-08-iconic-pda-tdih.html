On this day in 1927, a man whose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=V%E2%80%93J_day_in_Times_Square&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=229645442"><em>Wikipedia</em> entry</a> was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%E2%80%93J_day_in_Times_Square#Glenn_McDuffie">edited</a>, via cell, from Minute Maid Park in the home half of the seventh was born.&nbsp; Television crews didn’t capture the edit, but they did capture the man himself as
he waved feebly to the crowd of 38,602 baseball fans who applauded the
infamous V-J Day celebrant on the occasion of his 81st birthday.&nbsp; How
do I know?&nbsp; I was there.&nbsp; As luck would have it, not only was I there,
I was seated next to <a href="http://www.lonestarmets.com/">a blogger</a>. 
You’d think this was planned — Scott leaves house, “accidentally” meets
blogger, bores wife with insider baseball for hours — but it wasn’t. 
Honest.&nbsp; But I digress.</p>
<p>The octogenarian in question, Glenn McDuffie, has convinced <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=3422191">forensic artists and lie detectors</a> he should remembered as the sailor who stopped to kiss a stranger on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%E2%80%93J_day_in_Times_Square#Glenn_McDuffie">his way to his girlfriend’s apartment</a>.*&nbsp; How his girlfriend, Ardith Bloomfield of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=%22555+crown+street%22+brooklyn&amp;sll=40.669783,-73.939683&amp;sspn=0.009049,0.016565&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.670076,-73.938632&amp;spn=0.009049,0.024719&amp;t=k&amp;z=16&amp;cbll=40.665709,-73.940142&amp;panoid=_hcA07jboKCI0xi9ucWwgg&amp;cbp=2,0,,0,5">555 Crown Street</a> felt about his iconic act of infidelity isn’t only lost to history, but McDuffie too: <a href="http://www.thedestinlog.com/news/card_4867___article.html/times_mcduffie.html">he went to sea and never saw her again</a>.** 
McDuffie’s not the only person to claim the mantle of Great American
Osculator.&nbsp; He’s not even named as a potential candidate in the <em>Life</em>’s <a href="http://www.leatherneck.com/forums/showthread.php?t=16298">1980 attempt to ferret the identities of the infamous kisser and kissee</a>.</p>
<p>When you think about it, it’s only fitting he celebrated his birthday at major sporting event, since major sporting events <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MD7esdY_Kg">celebrate kissing</a> for a minute or two every game.***&nbsp; His kiss, however, has the <a href="http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/mar_apr07/forum.php">benefit of inadvertant artfullness</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Eisenstaedt’s photo is a perfect Renaissance
perspective, with the foreground directly on the lower part of the
bowtie, with big buildings converging diagonally toward the vanishing
point, and a giant sign with a paternal figure promoting Ruppert Beer
right on the point. This sailor and this nurse are surrounded by big
buildings, by silver trolley tracks, by neon signs, and by the sky, but
also by an assortment of other people. About twenty feet away there is
a second sailor (and, in some croppings, a third), smiling on the
couple. Another comment is suggested by the huge neon sign just to
their right, which advertises BOND, then America’s biggest ready-made
clothing store [...] The sign that proclaims the bond between this
primal couple also highlights the more complex bonds that hold together
the city, the country, maybe even the world. The other people in the
picture are participants in the crowd’s festivities, but also, like
ourselves, spectators of the couple’s embrace. They are both wearing
uniforms, which mark them as “public servants” and separate them from
the multitude of civilians (like ourselves) who surround them and whom
they serve. His uniform is black, hers white. The contrast between
them, sharpened by black-and-white film, heightens the clinch that
binds them together.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the man responsible for this quintessential American
photograph?&nbsp; A German Jewish refugee named Alfred Eisenstaedt whose
previous claim to fame was <a href="http://www.schlossberg-cohen.com/work.cfm?ID=866">a portrait of Goebbels</a> the Nazi Propaganda Minister only found unflattering <em>after</em> he learned Eisenstaedt was Jewish.&nbsp; Because before, I mean, I think we’d all hit that.****</p>

<hr />

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">*Only F. Lee Bailey remains skeptical.&nbsp; “If you honestly believe

Simpson’s defense <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/Story?id=3422191&amp;page=2">told ABC news</a> in 2007.&nbsp; Shortly after the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, he “<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E7DA163FF936A35755C0A9669C8B63">stopped [Simpson's polygraph test] because it was not going well</a>.”&nbsp; Seems Simpson didn’t honestly believe in his innocence in June 1994.&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2157652/pagenum/2/">Nor since</a>, for that matter.)</span></p>

He was a well-established photojournalist, and <a href="http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue9911/icon21.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>, from a decade earlier, has certainly been widely reproduced (though seldom so fuzzily).  The blurb on <a href="http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue9911/icon18.htm" rel="nofollow">this photo</a> captures him well, I think:</p>

<blockquote>I left Germany in November, 1935, and emigrated to the United States. I was lucky because I was a free-lancer for the Associated Press, so I found work very soon.  LIFE magazine started a year later. They looked at my photographs and told me, &#39;This is the sort of photography we want.&#39; I haven&#39;t ever had to change my style...</blockquote></span>

I watched Wristcutters: A Love Story for the same reason I've watched many a quirky, middlebrow film: Tom Waits. True to form, the film exuded a quirky, middlebrow charm. But it featured &quot;Through the Roof,&quot; by Gogol Bordello, which you must listen to. From the film: A (possibly the, but what do I know?) complete video: The tired, tossed off absurdity of the chorus comes from the Shane McGowan School of Lyric. Would that graduates were more plentiful and sober. I'm Scott Kaufman, and I approve of these videos.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/08/as-abish-attest.html"><span><strong>As Abish attests, all American art is alliterative.</strong> (x-posted.) Not really, of course. Only if it’s postmodern or romantic, and today it’s romantic. Edwin Markham’s The Real America in Romance (1909) sought to blend “authentic history and romance … to their mutual advantage.” His rationale: Here are set before us the examples of great men of earth, men great in their patriotism and self-sacrifice; and side by side with them are romantic characters typical of the times, men and women only less great in their kindliness and unselfishness, all affording a high expression of the art of Anglo-Saxon romance. Instead of reading about historical characters and events, we see the persons themselves in action, and live with them through the events of their day and generation. The reader loses himself in the irresistible fascination of the story, and the impressions resulting are made on the heart as well as on the intellect. You do not merely read about Columbus: you endure with him his hardships, share with him his disappointments, rejoice with him in his achievements. You actually feel the thrill of discovery when the New World swims into his vision. Not content with telling you merely that Washington wintered and suffered at Valley Forge with his army, the author takes you straightway into the camp, shows you the torn and bleeding feet of the soldiers, and makes you stand watch with the half-fed sentries, with little to warm your blood except a fiery determination to die of cold, hunger, or British bullets, rather than give up the fight for your country. That’s a single paragraph in the original, but I’ve sliced it up 1) because it’s overlong, and 2) to emphasize a rhetorical shift from “the reader” to “you.” What opens as a theory of literary affect quickly pivots into admonishment — the reader who doesn’t endure, share, rejoice, winter, suffer or stand watch isn’t merely a bad reader but unpatriotic. “If you have fail to empathize with those who fought ‘for your country,’” Markham as much as says, “you’re a terrible American.” He never considers a reader might withhold sympathy not because he or she possesses a paucity of patriotism, but because his bathetic prose betrays an ear unworthy of enthused encomium. Consider the first sentence of Volume IX, The Stars &amp; Stripes: A band of boys was abroad in the streets of Boston. But Scott, you say, happy accidents have happened heretofore! Granted. Now consider the first two sentences of the second paragraph: But it was not mirth nor mischief that brought them forth to throng the streets. So much might have been inferred from their eager and excited talk as they hurried over the flagging, covered thinly with snow. Those alliterative pairs — “mirth nor mischief” and “eager and excited” — bespeak a deliberately alliterative aesthetic agenda. Still don’t believe me? Turn to the twenty-first page and proceed to ponder this passage: Then the people, or such of them as did not feel the restraint of the more orderly element, rose in riot. The...</span></a></div>
