<p>We know what route the conservative punditry took, but who are we to begrudge them their moment of vindication? The <em>Times</em>
finally got around to finding their smoking gun for them. They now have
incontrovertible proof that Obama held, holds, and will forever harbor
deeply radical thoughts; that he held, holds, and will forever adhere
to an ideology hostile to American ideals and interests; that he held,
holds, and will forever—but we should allow him the courtesy of <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/obama-s-1983-college-magazine-article/original.pdf">hanging by his own rope</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The more sensitive among us struggle to extrapolate
experiences of war from our everyday experience, discussing the latest
mortality statistics from Guatemala, sensitizing ourselves to our
parents’ wartime memories, or incorporating into our framework a
reality as depicted by a Mailer or a Coppola. But the taste of war—the
sounds and chill, the dead bodies—are remote and far removed. We know
that wars have occurred, will occur, are occurring, but bringing such
experience down into our hearts, and taking continual, tangible steps
to prevent war, becomes a difficult task.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2009/06/breakthrough_on_the_authorship_1.html">one conservative</a>
who won’t be happy to see how rhetorically savvy Obama was as a senior.
The pacing of the nested clauses, the balance of the alliteration, the
oratorical flourishes of the parallelism—all the features of his later
prose are in evidence long before Obama met Ayers. Other than that, we
learn nothing new about Obama from this passage. He opposes the
extrajudicial killing of noncombatants in Guatemala and believes that
high culture can counter the effect of popular culture, such that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312265050/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Naked and the Dead</em></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FSME1A/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Apocalypse Now</em></a> work against <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0004Z33EG/diesekoschmar-20"><em>First Blood</em></a> by showing us the horror! the horror! of war. Neither position qualifies as a shocking revelation.</p>
<p>In fact, the only aspects of this well-timed find with which conservatives take issue are his “<a href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/rubin/72321">non-proliferation fetish</a>”
and the anti-militaristic rhetoric in which he couches it. They bemoan
the senior’s support for “the dangerously delusional nuclear-freeze
movement,” and they mock him for insisting that focusing on arms
control to the exclusion of larger economic and political issues might
be, in his words, “another instance of focusing on the symptoms of a
problem instead of the disease itself.” These ideas, they suggest, are
so far afield of the American mainstream that Obama is forced to quote
a <em>reggae singer</em> to substantiate them—and as Jennifer Rubin points out, what the reggae singer doesn’t know could very well kill us:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]hat is naïve, of course, is to think that Iran and
North Korea will be impressed by our disarmament efforts. No
consideration is given, just as none was given by the nuclear freeze
crowd a generation ago, to the possibility that disarmament will only
embolden our adversaries and confuse our allies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their argument is that, then as now, Obama cannot recognize that
being able to exterminate all life on Earth seven-hundred times over
possesses a strategic advantage over only being able to do so seventy.
Even absent a partner in our escalatory waltz, conservatives insist
that pushing the decimal point one slot to the left of absurdity will
embolden Iran and North Korea into—into—into what exactly? Defying
international law? Refusing to crumble under international pressure?
The young Obama understands what his opponents now do not:</p>
<p>Just because the status quo is more macho than its alternatives doesn’t mean it’s worth defending. In the same anti-masculinist vein, it&#39;s not <a href="http://patterico.com/2009/07/06/obama-the-russians-and-missile-defense/">naïve to inform the Russians that there are still a couple of kinks in our missile defense system</a>, because even if it ever successfully shot down anything, it was not designed to deter the Russians from attacking us:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011571d526d4970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Wheretheterroristslive" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011571d526d4970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011571d526d4970b-500wi" /></a> </p>
<p>More to the point, the so-called revelations from the article in the <em>Columbia Sundial</em> are only revelations to people who never read <em>The Audacity of Hope</em>, in which Obama addressed <em>all of these issues</em>, sometimes in a single paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>The advent of nuclear weapons and “mutual assured
destruction” rendered the risk of war between the United States and the
Soviet Union fairly remote even before the Berlin Wall fell. Today, the
world’s most powerful nations (including, to an ever-increasing extent,
China)—and, just as important, the vast majority of the people who live
within these nations—are largely committed to a common set of
international rules governing trade, economic policy, and the legal and
diplomatic resolution of disputes, even if broader notions of liberty
and democracy aren’t widely observed within their own borders. The
growing threat, then, comes primarily from those parts of the world on
the margins of the global economy where the international “rules of the
road” have not taken hold—the realm of weak or failing states,
arbitrary rule, corruption, and chronic violence; lands in which an
overwhelming majority of the population is poor, uneducated, and cut
off from the global information grid; places where the rulers fear
globalization will loosen their hold on power, undermine traditional
cultures, or displace indigenous institutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, conservatives are using the “discovery” of this article to
show Americans that, in opposing Reagan, Obama proves himself to be
just another acolyte of the pacifistic hippie radicalism that almost
lost us the Cold War. What I find remarkable is not that the political
formula developed by Reagan worked at the time, but just how durable
the narrative that he helped promote has proven to be. Despite a
forty-year remove, the tumult of the sixties and the subsequent
backlash continues to drive our political discourse. Partly it
underscores how deeply felt the conflicts of the sixties must have been
for the men and women who came of age at that time, and the degree to
which the arguments of the era were understood not simply as political
disputes but as individual choices that defined personal identity and
moral standing.</p>
<p>Wait—who wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307237702/diesekoschmar-20">those last three sentences</a>? </p><p>Well, whoever it was, he was some sorta prescient.</p><p>(<em><a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/07/07/best-to-only-ever-fight-the-wars-you-already-won/">x-posted</a></em>.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to bait people into doing just that as we speak.  Updates to come.</p>

<p><em>Someone should do something!</em></p>

<p>Block access to the library already!  They&#39;re in there learning DANGER!</p>

<p><em>The conservatives involved probably never did any research, even as students, and have no interest in anything even remotely intellectual, and therefore project their own ideas on how they would run a library onto the actual ones.</em></p>

<p>Bingo!  I was amused, then despondent, at the fact that conservatives are basically claiming that the media is biased because it won&#39;t do their job for them and they&#39;re too lazy to do it themselves.  They&#39;re such . . . students in that respect.</p></span>

The evidence that the actual Spartans were homosexual [thanks James] is scant and somewhat contradictory. In the most frequently cited classical source, &quot;The Polity of the Lacedaemons,&quot; Xenephon insists that the Spartans were not homosexual in the manner of the Boetians and Eleians: I ought, as it seems to me, not to omit some remark on the subject of boy attachments, it being a topic in close connection with that of boyhood and the training of boys. We know that the rest of the Hellenes deal with this relationship in different ways, either after the manner of the Boeotians, where man and boy are intimately united by a bond like that of wedlock, or after the manner of the Eleians, where the fruition of beauty is an act of grace; whilst there are others who would absolutely debar the lover from all conversation and discourse with the beloved. Lycurgus adopted a system opposed to all of these alike. Given that some one, himself being all that a man ought to be, should in admiration of a boy's soul endeavour to discover in him a true friend without reproach, and to consort with him—this was a relationship which Lycurgus commended, and indeed regarded as the noblest type of bringing up. But if, as was evident, it was not an attachment to the soul, but a yearning merely towards the body, he stamped this thing as foul and horrible; and with this result, to the credit of Lycurgus be it said, that in Lacedaemon the relationship of lover and beloved is like that of parent and child or brother and brother where carnal appetite is in abeyance. (301, emphasis mine) Note that while there are no carnal relations allowed in Sparta, the male-male couple is still referred to as &quot;lover and beloved,&quot; which leads me to believe this could be a rough Spartan equivalent of the Sacred Band of Thebes. The other most frequently cited ancient source cited on homosexuality in Sparta is Plutarch's &quot;Life of Lycurgus,&quot; in which he describes the wedding night and connubial bliss of the married Spartan couple thus: Then the woman that had the direction of the wedding, cut the bride's hair close to the skin, dressed her in man's clothes, laid her upon a mattress, and left her in the dark. The bridegroom, neither oppressed with wine, nor enervated with luxury, but perfectly sober, as having always supped at the common table, went in privately, untied her girdle, and carried her to another bed. Having stayed there a short time, he modestly retired to his usual apartment, to sleep with the other young men; and he observed the same conduct afterwards, spending the day with his companions, and reposing himself with them in the night, nor even visiting his bride, but with great caution and apprehensions of being discovered by the...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/07/the-telos-of-the-back-cover.html"><span><strong>The telos of the back cover</strong> I can imagine no more frustrating a reading experience than the one I just had with Iain M. Banks' Excession. Is it a great novel? I don't know. Is it a good novel? I don't know. Why don't I know? Because I didn't—because I couldn't—read the novel on its own terms. I spent the entire time awaiting the arrival of a plot that never materialized. Why did I do that? Because of the back cover: [Diplomat Byr Genar-Hofoen has been selected by the Culture to undertake a delicate and dangerous mission. The Department of Special Circumstances—the Culture's espionage and dirty tricks section—has sent him off to investigate a 2,500-year-old mystery: the sudden disappearance of a star fifty times older than the universe itself. But in seeking the secret of the lost sun, Byr risks losing himself. There is only one way to break the silence of millennia: steal the soul of the long-dead starship captain who first encountered the star, and convince her to be reborn. And in accepting this mission, Byr will be swept into a vast conspiracy that could lead the universe into an age of peace . . . or to the brink of annihilation. ] It should go without saying by now that none of that actually happens in the novel. There is a conspiracy and the name is correct—although it refers to only one of the novel's many characters—but the plot points on the back cover all refer to a single dream that character had on pp. 389-391. In retrospect, I find it difficult not to filter the events of the novel back through that short passage, and it almost works: the consciousness of a character (Zreyn Tramow) who witnessed the disappearance of that sun 2,500 years ago is slipped into Byr Genar-Hofoen's dream by a Mind (Grey Area) that plans to make contact with an &quot;Outside Context Problem&quot; (the titular &quot;excession&quot;) similar to the disappearance of that sun, and at the end of the novel Tramow herself is awakened from storage shortly after the Grey Area enters the excession, but these are minor plot points unworthy of even being labeled as spoilers.* Because of the teleology imposed upon the novel by the back cover, however, every other element of the novel is subsumed by this bit of narrative driftwood. That is not to say this subplot is unimportant, merely that it is the equivalent of this: Not that there might not be value to doing that—countless classic novels could be made greater by misdirection of this sort—but this mode of false advertising utterly alters the experience of reading the novel. Were you to read the version of Gravity's Rainbow above, you would spend the whole second half of the novel awaiting the return of the beach-terrorizing octopuses. The back-cover plot summary is as critical a heuristic as the title: we all remember that Introduction to Literature exercise in which the instructor asks you to imagine that the title of the book is Ahab or...</span></a></div>
