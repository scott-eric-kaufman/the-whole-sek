Imbibe wisdom, brother: The Remade and fRemade, as conceptually satisfying as they are, could only be done justice by David Cronenberg, and then we'd suffer through more eXistenZ-esque spine-sphincters that'll provide me nightmares for nightmore nightmonths than I'll ever divulge. Oh, and the pus slick. Can't forget the pus slick. Just like an oil slick, only all pus. Only. All. Pus. Mieville writes: &quot;It was some viscous liquid, thick as dense mud. Where waves reached its outer edges they reduced to ugly ripples that crawled weakly across the surface of the substance and were swallowed up. The stuff was the pallid yellow-white of a caveworm....A rolling mass of smell oozed over them....The dwobbling white mass stank of the worst, most septic rot, air-starved flesh gone putrid.&quot; Incredible prose there. The good people of Crooked Timber had a reason for seminaring Mieville and it wasn't his B.A. in social anthropology or his Masters in economics. Nay, brother, the man can write. I only pray he never applies his talents to film adaptations, as a Cronenberg-helmed adaptation of a Mieville novel will have crowds retching with the same violence of an Armada denizen slowly slipping from ship to ship in the middle of a pus slick. Rarely, if ever, is a writer so talented as to win such devotion and barter such opprobrium. My ambivalence normally neuters any strong feelings I have about authors about whom I feel ambivalent. But with Mieville I feel an ambivalence born of deep discomfort. He prods me into unthinking instead of overthinking with his imagery. I simply cannot overcome it as I can the disturbing implications of, say, an Octavia Butler novel. I've shuddered three times composing this." />

		<span id="comment-6446858-content"><p>&quot;Name one piece of writing you love which will be ruined by being made into a film by Michael Crichton&quot;.</p>

<p>Ibn Fadlan&#39;s true report of his visit to Bulgar ca. 900 AD, where he witnessed a Viking funeral complete with an orgy, a human sacrifice, and the sudden dismembering of a live horse by dozens of swords simultaneously. </p>

<p>Ibn Fadlan was all prissy in his report, but you could tell that he&#39;d just been dying to see the real Viking nasty. He also may have been attracted to the guys.</p>

<p>I had Jodorowsky in mind, if he still exists. Crichton put in a lot of lame bullshit with Neanderthals, etc.</p></span>

And by &quot;complete,&quot; I believe they mean all of them. Plain text and scanned images of the bard's breathlessly illegible script. There will also be plain text versions of all the significant secondary material. The current seraphic quality of countenance notwithstanding, I'm so hankering to read Darwin and his significant secondaries the idea of waiting until October--that's months after my summer dissertation grant (not to mention summer) expires--threatens my sanity. I've led the Rabid Rabble before. I can reassemble their ranks for some Rabid Rabble Rampaging. I know the procedure.
