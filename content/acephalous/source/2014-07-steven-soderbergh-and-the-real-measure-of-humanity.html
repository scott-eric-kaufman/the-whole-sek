That’s a deal-breaker for me. If I were on the verge of getting into a serious relationship and I saw that person be mean to a waiter — I’m out. That’s a core problem. You’re being mean to someone who’s helping you. What is that? Everyone knows who the assholes are, and I avoid them. Because it’s a funny story, but in the ’90s I actually waited on Steven Soderbergh quite a bit, and if that’s his litmus test, he didn’t pass it. Not even remotely. Because as memory serves, when Soderbergh was a regular at the used bookstore/coffee shop I worked at, his treatment of me then would’ve been a deal-breaker for him now. One particularly memorable conversation involved his then-obsession with Ambrose Bierce. I’d placed the special orders for the books myself, so I knew they’d just come in the week before Mr. Ambrose Bierce Expert saw me reading Mason &amp; Dixon behind the counter. He proceeded to excitedly tell me, at length and with some volume, that I was wasting my time reading Thomas Pynchon, because Ambrose Bierce was where it’s really at. He went on and on and on, enthralled by his own love of Bierce — which, after I became an Americanist and read him, I believe is totally justifiable. But the point is, Soderbergh wouldn’t just have failed his own criterion for the measure of humanity, he would have done so spectacularly. Which, as a friend on Facebook noted, might be the point. He might have chosen his worst character trait as the defining characteristic of humanity because it’s something he had to overcome, and given the depth of charity to the underprivileged and unvoiced evident in his work, I’m tempted to believe that. Because as much as I despised him as a patron when I had to deal with him, I can’t help but admire — however begrudgingly — what he’s done with himself in the years since, especially Che. I know I’m defending the film against an idiot of an ideologue at that link, but even if I had to defend it against Roger Ebert himself, I’d do so with the same vehemence… …despite how I feel about the man personally. He’s just that talented, damn it. There’s a real humanity to his late-period work, especially in the films that everyone hated because they dealt with unsavory subjects like prostitutes or viral pandemics or Che. So on behalf of all the baristas and book-store employees he berated before he came to understand this truth as being self-evident, I’m just going to go ahead and forgive him." />

He could have looked at what you were reading and said to himself &quot;Yeech.&quot;  He could have ignored your reading, because you just weren&#39;t important.  But instead, he saw you as a living breathing human being, and did his damndest to convert you to his way of seeing things.  Which is a bit pushy in some ways, but it&#39;s a billion miles away from shrugging off a barrista or a waiter as some kind of annoying ant.</p>

<p>Your casual acquaintanceship with Soderbergh didn&#39;t demean you.  He took you seriously.  It&#39;s a mark of honor.  You should be proud.</p></span>

And the title of it references a beloved Internet Tradition! Sample: What had, minutes earlier, been an audition for the role of “child” in a production of “family” has transformed into one for the role of “cog” in “drug enterprise.” The confusion created by placing these scenes back-to-back will resonate throughout the season, as Taystee must decide whether Vee is a caring mother figure or an exacting boss. Initially, at least, she seems to understand the difference—but as the episode progresses, the amount of emotional energy she invests in acquiring a job becomes increasingly excessive, making the stitching of these two scenes together seem increasingly meaningful.</span></a></div>

TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN: You just put a new battery in it? SEK: That I did. TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN: Means your electrical is reset, our computer can’t do a lot of the tests. SEK: So long as its fluids are replenished and it doesn’t have murder in its heart, I’m fine. TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN: So when do you need it by? SEK: I have a meeting at 2 p.m. TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN: I don’t think I can have it done by 1:30. SEK: No a problem, I work online. Just need to be back home and I live around the corner. TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN: What do you do? SEK: I write online. TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN: People do that? SEK: As long as they pay me to. TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN: I thought that was computers did that. SEK: ? TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN: They don’t have that shit programmed out yet? Our computer tells us what happened with a car, figure it was the same with what the President said and shit. SEK: I don’t think they have a computer that can do that. TRUSTWORTHY LOCAL AUTO MAN: Couldn’t be worse than what they’ve got.</span></a></div>
