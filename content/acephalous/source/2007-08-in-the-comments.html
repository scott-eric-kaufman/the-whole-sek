Never try to leave the floor when you talk about flying. Never close your eyes and jerk your head to one side when you talk about death. Do not fix your burning eyes on me when you speak about love.

Speak the words with the exact precision with which you would check out a laundry list. Do not become emotional about the lace blouse. Do not get a hard-on when you say panties. Do not get all shivery just because of the towel. The sheets should not provoke a dreamy expression about the eyes. There is no need to weep into the handkerchief. The socks are not there to remind you of strange and distant voyages. It is just your laundry. It is just your clothes. Don't peep through them. Just wear them. No. Cohen can brook the performance of poetry, he simply has no patience for poets whose performance consists of a pale representation of their poems: &quot;The word butterfly is not a real butterfly.&quot; Cohen rails against the obviousness of reference, against the poet who shoots his audience a seductive look when he speaks of seduction, who mistakes the words for what they represent. His dictum against the obviousness of reference extends to the obviousness of response: &quot;Do not get a hard-on when you say panties.&quot; Inspiring the audience to erection is the point, otherwise the performance degrades into expression—another uninteresting whinge about which no one beside the poet cares. Anyone who listens to Cohen must choose which Cohen performs &quot;How to Speak Poetry&quot; in his or her head. Will it be the thin, flat voice of the '60s and '70s or the gruff majesty..." />

				<p>No.&nbsp; Cohen can brook the <em>performance </em>of poetry, he simply has no patience for poets whose performance consists of a pale representation of their poems:&nbsp; &quot;The word butterfly is not a real butterfly.&quot;&nbsp; Cohen rails against the obviousness of reference, against the poet who shoots his audience a seductive look when he speaks of seduction, who mistakes the words for what they represent.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Anyone who listens to Cohen must choose which Cohen performs &quot;How to Speak Poetry&quot; in his or her head.&nbsp; Will it be the thin, flat voice of the '60s and '70s or the gruff majesty of the '80s and '90s?&nbsp; Time for visual aids.&nbsp; Do you hear this one:</p>

<p>Or this one, chosen <em>not</em> because it's a striptease, but because it's a striptease from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305428107/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Exotica</em></a> and I never miss an opportunity to <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/10/the_trouble_wit_1.html">praise</a> Atom Egoyan:</p>

<p>Does it make a difference so long as it is read without affect?&nbsp; Can it even be read with affect?&nbsp; I ask because so much spoken poetry reminds me of <a href="http://todgoldberg.typepad.com/tod_goldberg/2007/07/the-dulcet-tone.html">this</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Some people read poetry, which I think we can all agree, is a form of torture we should really be employing on enemy combatants. Remember when we were trying to get Noriega out of his compound and we blasted heavy metal as an enticement for him to give up—and let me tell you, you want me out of my compound, all you need to do is get some White Lion on the loudspeaker and my shit will be making time for the exit like it was my job—and yet inside he stayed? I'm telling you, get some black clad-clove-smoking-Tori Amos fan out there reading his free verse in poet voice and we could solve the Gaza Strip issue in five lines:

&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p><em>And the WORDS were like a RASH upon my FECES

&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />AND the feces were like a burning BUSH and Bush was like my FECES

&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Upon the alter of OIL and THE MAN and the Man was like A RASH

&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />And I am a TOOL of LIFE and LIFE is a TOOL that smells of my fetid waste

&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />WASTE. WASTE. I am a waste. A BURNING BUSH. The hypodermic push of my ... </em>Oh, sorry, looks like the Palestinians and the Israelis have figured it all out. I'm off to the hooka lounge.</p></blockquote><p>Cohen certainly never sounded so craven, despite gazing more deeply into his navel than most of his contemporaries.&nbsp; &quot;How to Speak Poetry&quot; is far too measured to bear the treatment of Tod Goldberg's hypothetical emoter.&nbsp; Were this a different sort of blog, and were bandwidth permitting, I would love nothing more than for people to submit slammed versions of Cohen's prose-poem.&nbsp; Who could pass up the opportunity to hear the tale of the fucking flower-befriending butterfly, hovering the fuck hither, the fuck thither, so fucking fragile, so fucking symbolic, like a bush, a burning bush, a fucking burning Bush, burning in the effigy, in the effigy of sympathy, for the fucking efficacy, of the inefficacy, of the inefficiency, of the bush, the burning Bush ...&nbsp; </p>

<p>I take it back.&nbsp; That would be horrific.&nbsp; Even in parody, some things bruise the soul.&nbsp; <br /> </p>

		<span id="comment-78415000-content"><p>Marc, I&#39;ve heard the Eliot, but if I remember correctly, he&#39;s reading it in the &#39;40s, which would be like hearing Cohen sing &quot;Suzanne&quot; now.  Torture, indeed.</p>

<p>Ahistoricality, you won&#39;t find me parodying Cohen, although the man himself does now.  &quot;The Future&quot; is a far cry from anything off <em>New Skin for the Old Ceremony</em>.  The same goes for the Dylan comparison: better to hear Jeff Buckley sing &quot;Hallelujah&quot; than Cohen at this point, but I don&#39;t think anyone other than Cohen can make &quot;The Stranger Song&quot; dance.  And now that I think about it, most of what makes the covers of his mid- and late-period material superior is the lack of 1) synthesizers and 2) annoying female backing vocals.  Strip Cohen&#39;s &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; down and it&#39;s every bit as good as Concrete Blonde&#39;s cover.  </p>

<p>Adam, the sound of poetry slamming is comparable to the sound the body of an investment banker working on the fiftieth floor makes upon impact.  Disgustingly squishy yet crunchy, like God cracking the knuckles of His Soapy Hands.</p></span>

<p>I will, of course, horor your simple request. But, if I may, perhaps you&#39;d allow me to share a little story with you. </p>

<p>One night, working at a club in New York, Louis Armstrong had just climbed down off the stand after a particularly brilliant set when a fashionably-dressed woman came up to him in the bar and said, &quot;You were just brilliant tonight, Mr. Armstrong, but I was wondering if you could tell me, what is jazz?&quot;</p>

<p>Dabbing at his damp forehead with a monogrammed handkerchief, Satchmo just smiled and said, &quot;Lady, if you have to ask, you&#39;ll never know.&quot;</p></span>

The fact that there are some amazing covers of his work (I&#39;ll throw my vote in with John Cale&#39;s version of &quot;Hallelujah,&quot; though Rufus Wainwright&#39;s is great too.) doesn&#39;t take anything away from the power of the originals, particularly for the earlier work.  Other people&#39;s voices can sound more pleasant singing &quot;Suzanne&quot;, but I don&#39;t think anyone could achieve the same transcendent mix of regret and lack of regret that Cohen does.  Scott gets the orchestration point about middle/late work right, though some of those songs are also just crap.</p>

		<span id="comment-78438500-content"><p><i>Anyway</i>, back to the original point of this post, I think Cohen is engaging in the &quot;fallacy of the excluded middle&quot;: there&#39;s a huge stylistic gap between laundry lists and fluttering butterflies. Even with a single author, if they&#39;ve got any range at all, some poems will sing with minimal presentations, and some invite playing along. We&#39;ve been reading &quot;Old Possum&#39;s Book of Practical Cats&quot; to the Little Anachronism (yes, we&#39;re going to see <i>that</i> musical and we wanted to prep the little one so we don&#39;t have to spend the whole time explaining stuff), and somehow I just can&#39;t see those poems and &quot;The Wasteland&quot; being effectively read in the same style. </p>

<p>Obviously, Cohen really didn&#39;t acknowledge the existence (or at least the emotional reality) of anything other than the &quot;artistic&quot; emotions and modes, the ironic, the angsty, the incomprehensibly metaphorical, in other words, the serious. Given that, his screed makes sense, but it&#39;s a parody of itself, frankly.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-78482160-content"><p><i>Cohen, like Dylan, is an acquired taste.</i></p>

<p>I guess.  I liked both of them the first time I heard them, which would have been age 10 for Dylan and age 16 for Cohen.  I don&#39;t think they&#39;re in the same league—Cohen has some amazing songs, but also some boring and indulgent ones; he doesn&#39;t do bitter sneering nearly as well as Dylan; and his verse structure changes hardly at all.  I&#39;d say Dylan&#39;s voice is better, as well, though Cohen singing &quot;Suzanne&quot; or &quot;First We Take Manhattan&quot; is as good as it gets.</p>

<p>Ahistoricality, the reason people get upset when you say that the covers of Dylan songs are better than his own versions, is that equating a singer&#39;s quality with the traditional purity and range of his or her voice is a form of small-mindedness that we&#39;re tired of hearing.  Honestly, you aren&#39;t saying anything that I didn&#39;t hear from my friends in 5th grade.  I find the Byrds&#39; version of &quot;Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; vapid and meaningless, lacking any of the feeling that Dylan&#39;s rich voice conveys.  It&#39;s a short step from to saying that Dylan sings &quot;poorly&quot; (I followed your link), to saying that Celine Dion is a great artist because of her remarkable range.</p>

<p>(That doesn&#39;t explain the &quot;breathing into a bag&quot; reaction, since your opinion is so common; I stopped being shocked years ago that people don&#39;t like Dylan&#39;s voice, but I&#39;ve never stopped being disdainful.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-78498854-content"><p>It&#39;s not Dylan&#39;s voice that bothers me, as such. There are singers of (roughly) equally poor timbre and purity whose singing I find quite pleasurable (John Prine and Malvina Reynolds are the first who come to mind). And my favorite versions of Dylan and Cohen covers are picked for energy, not shimmering quality (though I&#39;ll admit that Joan Baez has both, most of the time).</p>

<p>Actually, I&#39;d say that my problem with Dylan is very similar to my problem with Celine Dion: I honestly don&#39;t feel anything when I hear him sing, most of the time, and I get the impression that he doesn&#39;t care. If that makes me a philistine, so be it. Whatever he&#39;s selling, it just doesn&#39;t speak to me. </p>

<p>That said, I do think that he wrote some fantastic lyrics back in the day, and so did Cohen, but they both got way too full of the idea that anything that dropped out of their brains was &quot;art.&quot; </p></span>

Have you ever heard the recordings of Robert Frost?  He sounded pretty much like Jonathan Winters, to the point that, when I heard those recordings in high school (about a gazillion years ago when Jonathan Winters was still on television), I very nearly fell under my desk.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-79315138-content"><p>I just came across this because <a href="<a" href="<a" rel="nofollow">http://www.eaglesfans.com/info/articles/songwriting_heart_of_the_matter.htm&gt;Don</a> Henley recommended that lyricists should read &quot;How to Speak Poetry&quot;</a>. I was shocked by how counterintuitive the advice was. It seems dishonest to tell people you have strong feelings about something but then act as if you don&#39;t as you render the message out loud before an audience. That would strike me as apathy, not respect for the audience, as he alludes with that labored mountain climbing analogy. Performing arts are entertainment, mountain climber meetings are not, and if it were, I would like the presenter to mime out how he compromised that big rock. </p>

<p>The vast majority of artistically and commercially successful musicians &quot;act&quot; to some degree, often to great degree, including Henley, so I&#39;m shocked to see that this prose essay is so highly regarded, especially given it&#39;s wordiness, indirectness and vulgarity.</p>

<p>Sure, Celine Dion is not a great artist by virtue of an amazing range, but it also doesn&#39;t help that she doesn&#39;t write her own music or that she tastelessly hams up the music she&#39;s given. Music is a performance art, and the more elements that can be successfully coordinated to achieve whatever the aim, the better.</p>

<p>Maybe Cohen just sucked as a performer and wanted to convince others the lower the bar to his level.</p></span>

Autistic-like responses will show poor social skill, attention switching, communication and imagination, and an exaggerated attention to detail. In other words, geekiness. You scored 35. Scores over 32 are generally taken to indicate Asperger's Syndrome or high-functioning autism, with more than 34 an &quot;extreme&quot; score. I don't have poor social skills—I'm a charmer! I'm exquisitely communicative and quite imaginative—look at all the great stories I invented whole-cloth for your amusement! But I'll cop to an exaggerated attention to detail. I do pay too much attention to things that don't matter. But this talent allows me to discover tiny things liable to escape the notice of people with perspective. Were I less detail-oriented, I may have finished the dissertation already ... but it wouldn't have nearly as many footnotes. And footnotes—especially when of dubious relevance—are what really makes a monograph look scholarly. On an unrelated note, I found this post and the comments it generated so interesting I kept the tab open for three or four days.</span></a></div>

There you are on a Saturday night, futzing with your wedding ring because your wife thinks your trichotillomania makes you look mangy: off your left ring finger, onto your right pinkie; off your right pinkie, onto your left pinkie; off your left pinkie, onto your right ring finger; off your right ring finger, off your right ring finger, OFF YOUR RIGHT RING FINGER, non et cetera. You pull and you twist; you pull while twisting and you twist while pulling all to no avail. You look at your wife and you tell her, &quot;I've misplaced my wedding band.&quot; She will look at you, j'accuse burning in her eyes, until you hold up your right hand. She will then enter the kitchen and return with the ingredients required to perform Step One: 1. Apply cold water and a little soap. Gently work the soap under the ring and twist. If the ring still does not come off, massage the area of the finger below the knuckle to remove some of the fluid from the finger. Wait a few minutes, then repeat. Continue until the finger is good and chafed. After fifteen minutes of repeated failure, your wife will walk back into the kitchen and return with the materials needed for Step Two: 2. Dry the chafed finger with hand towel, then apply the following in any order: water-based lubricants, oil-based lubricants, semi-solid fats, hydrogenated vegetable oils, as well as any lard, suet, ghee, tallow, or schmaltz you find lying around. As with the soap and water, work the slippery substance under the ring and twist and turn. Carefully slip a knife under the ring and try to slide it over the knuckle. If the ring-bearer cries in pain, ascertain whether its source is the ring jamming on the knuckle or the knife slicing into it. This too will fail. Your wife will walk back into the kitchen yet again. Take this opportunity to try to wash your hilariously lubed finger. The water-based lubricants will dissolve quickly, but the oil-based lubricants, semi-solid fats, suet, schmaltz, &amp;c. will take some time. Expect to find an oily residue scumming the top of the bucket used in Step Three: 3. Thrust your hand into the bucket of ice water which your wife has brought in from the kitchen. Leave it in there until the ring-bearer screams. When he does, shoot him a look of unconcealed embarrassment with a hint of disappointment, then allow him to &quot;tough&quot; it out for another three minutes. Once he passes out, remove his hand from the bucket and check to see that the desired amount of vasoconstriction has occurred, then repeat steps one and two. You may notice that despite the intense cold and vigorous oily massaging, the area above the ring becomes increasingly swollen. This is normal. God designed the human body intelligently: when you unsuccessfully attempt to remove a ring from a swollen...</span></a></div>
