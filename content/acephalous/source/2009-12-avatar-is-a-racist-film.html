        <meta name="description" content="Annalee Newitz writes that &quot;[w]hether Avatar is racist is a matter of debate,&quot; but it isn't: the film is racist. Its fundamental narrative logic is racist: it transposes the cultural politics of Westerns (in which the Native Americans are animists who belong to a more primitive race) onto an interplanetary conflict and then assuages the white guilt that accompanies acts of racial and cultural genocide by having a white man save the noble savages (who are also racists). Unlike King Kong—which wrestled with the racial logic of the original—Avatar reproduces the racist logic of its source material. This is not to say the film is not also a condemnation of American imperialism or disastrous environmental policies, because it's that too. I'll address the racial politics more in a moment, but let me address the portrayal of the military (much bemoaned here) first: It all adds up to crossing a line that I’ve never experienced in a major American film: drawing the audience to cheer the brutal deaths of Americans who are clearly symbolizing the military. Blackwater/Xe Services LLC is not the military. Mercenaries are not symbols of the military. They are a perversion of the military. James Cameron has an unabashed love for the military (Aliens, The Abyss, etc.) but that love does not extend to those who make war for profit. It's obvious that the only authentic military man in the film is the protagonist, Jake Sully, who lost his legs in a legitimate conflict. He turns from the soulless mercenary-logic like a good proxy for the audience, and this is where the racial politics become problematic. The titular &quot;avatars&quot; are genetically designed Na'vi bodies that can be remotely piloted by people like Sully with the intent of studying the natives. (Think anthropological immersion at its most literal.) The Na'vi are not merely distrustful of &quot;the space people,&quot; they're inherently xenophobic, incapable of trusting any sentient being that doesn't look like them. If that mistrust is justified for some other reason (like a hairy first contact), the film never mentions it, meaning (in a classic case of projection) the humans assume that the Na'vi will be xenophobic before they even meet them. But the racial essentialism of the film creates a whopper of an unintended thematic irony.* The planet and everything on it do not simply coexist in a harmonious balance of the New Age variety: they are hard-wired into a single neural network that makes the entire planet into a single entity and &quot;the space people&quot; less like a colonizing mercenary force than a disease. The humans are to be resisted not because they are economic imperialists (though they are) and not because they glory in militaristic combat (though they do) but because they are different. They do not belong to the planet and therefore there is no possibility for peaceful coexistence. The only way humans can be accepted is for them to forsake their humanity and become Na'vi.

			<p>Annalee Newitz <a href="http://io9.com/5422666/when-will-white-people-stop-making-movies-like-avatar">writes</a> that &quot;[w]hether <em>Avatar </em>is racist is a matter of debate,&quot; but it isn&#39;t: the film is racist.&#0160; Its fundamental narrative logic is racist: it transposes the cultural politics of Westerns (in which the Native Americans are animists who belong to a more primitive race) onto an interplanetary conflict and then assuages the white guilt that accompanies acts of racial and cultural genocide by having a white man save the noble savages (who are also racists).&#0160; Unlike <em>King Kong</em>—which <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/12/king_kong_the_s.html">wrestled with the racial logic of the original</a>—<em>Avatar </em>reproduces the racist logic of its source material.&#0160; This is not to say the film is not also a condemnation of American imperialism or disastrous environmental policies, because it&#39;s that too.&#0160; I&#39;ll address the racial politics more in a moment, but let me address the portrayal of the military (<a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/ckozlowski/2009/12/17/dances-with-wolves-in-space-camerons-avatar-gets-visuals-right-everything-else-wrong/">much</a> <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/bighollywood/2009/12/19/avatar-open-thread-what-did-you-think/">bemoaned</a> <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/mpatterson/2009/12/20/dear-hollywood-its-over-between-us/">here</a>) first:</p><blockquote><p>It all adds up to crossing a line that I’ve never experienced in a
major American film: drawing the audience to cheer the brutal deaths of
Americans who are clearly symbolizing the military.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackwater_Worldwide">Blackwater/Xe Services LLC</a> is not the military.&#0160; Mercenaries are not symbols of the military.&#0160; They are a <em>perversion </em>of the military.&#0160; James Cameron has an unabashed love for the military (<em>Aliens</em>, <em>The Abyss</em>, etc.) but that love does not extend to those who make war for profit.&#0160; It&#39;s obvious that the only authentic military man in the film is the protagonist, Jake Sully, who lost his legs in a legitimate conflict.&#0160; He turns from the soulless mercenary-logic like a good proxy for the audience, and this is where the racial politics become problematic.&#0160; </p>

<p>The titular &quot;avatars&quot; are genetically designed Na&#39;vi bodies that can be remotely piloted by people like Sully with the intent of studying the natives.&#0160; (Think anthropological immersion at its most literal.)&#0160; The Na&#39;vi are not merely distrustful of &quot;the space people,&quot; they&#39;re inherently xenophobic, incapable of trusting any sentient being that doesn&#39;t look like them.&#0160; If that mistrust is justified for some other reason (like a hairy first contact), the film never mentions it, meaning (in a classic case of projection) the humans assume that the Na&#39;vi will be xenophobic before they even meet them.</p>

<p>But the racial essentialism of the film creates a whopper of an unintended thematic irony.*&#0160; The planet and everything on it do not simply coexist in a harmonious balance of the New Age variety: they are hard-wired into a single neural network that makes the entire planet into a single entity and &quot;the space people&quot; less like a colonizing mercenary force than a disease.&#0160; The humans are to be resisted not because they are economic imperialists (though they are) and not because they glory in militaristic combat (though they do) but <em>because they are different</em>.&#0160; They do not belong to the planet and therefore there is no possibility for peaceful coexistence.&#0160; The only way humans can be accepted is for them to forsake their humanity and <em>become </em>Na&#39;vi.&#0160; (Think literal assimilation.)&#0160; </p>

<p>This is not a vision of a racially harmonious social politic: it is an inversion of the logic of passing that seems acceptable only because it imagines the experience of becoming a person of color as necessarily ennobling.&#0160; The film argues that once a white person truly and deeply understands the non-white experience, he becomes an unstoppable combination of non-white primitivism and white rationalism <em>which is exactly what happens</em>.&#0160; In order for the audience to support the transformation of Jake Sully into Braveheart Smurf, it must accept the essentialist assumptions that make such a combination possible ... and those assumptions are racist.&#0160; In football terms, this is a variation of the black quarterback &quot;problem.&quot;</p>

<p>For decades, coaches and scouts wished they could find a black body with a white brain in it.&#0160; (&quot;If only someone could find a way to stuff Peyton Manning&#39;s brain into JaMarcus Russell&#39;s body!&quot;)&#0160; The essentialist logic at play there is obvious: black people are more athletic than white, and white people are smarter than black.&#0160; No matter how <em>descriptive</em> these people thought they were being, in truth they were <em>creating</em> the conditions they claimed to describe: black quarterbacks were increasingly valued for raw athleticism, white athletes for their pocket presence and tactical acumen.&#0160; That&#39;s an expectations game based on racist expectations ... and it works according to the same logic behind the narrative of <em>Avatar</em>.&#0160; </p>

<p></p>

<p>*I&#39;m analogizing race and species here because Cameron&#39;s space fable encourages me to do so with all the subtlety of a fry pan upside my head.<br /> </p>

I can&#39;t defend Cameron&#39;s primitivist depiction of the Na&#39;vi, but I wonder if Sully can be at least partially redeemed if we think of him less as a white brain in an Other&#39;s body and more as an outsider pupil who, after much training, becomes even more adept than his masters.  (I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m persuaded by this argument myself, but The 36th Chamber of Shaolin and Drunken Master came to mind in the theater for me even as I was sighing at all the noble savagery.) </p></span>

There&#39;s a difference, I think, between &quot;learning a discipline via montage&quot; and &quot;going native.&quot;  (Again, I&#39;m floating ideas here and am not wedded to my reading; in point of fact, I&#39;d love to be talked out of it.)</p></span>

<p>I try!</p>

<p><em>Granted that Cameron&#39;s technology and ambitions are greater, but is this more racist than the standard Star Trek (OS, NG, DS9, V, etc) conceit that all members of a species share a uniform culture (even, especially, when they&#39;re at war with themselves) and that whites (aka humans) can understand, participate in, learn from and transcend them all by virtue of not being that sort of race?</em></p>

<p>Yes.  In fact, when the Braveheart Smurf unites all the people of the world, the only difference is whether they&#39;re mostly Na&#39;vi-who-ride-things-with-legs and Na&#39;vi-who-ride-things-with-wings.  That said, it&#39;s unlike <em>Trek</em> in one crucial respect: the humans in the film don&#39;t do the learning, only the audience of it.  The humans are carted off at the end contrite not because they&#39;ve done wrong, but because they&#39;ve lost.  </p></span>

You could employ the mercenaries&#39; use of phrases like &quot;shock and awe&quot; to demonstrate that they&#39;re figures of the American military, but if you&#39;re going to do that, you have to do that, <em>i.e.</em> you have to make that argument.

<p>Being a perversion of X doesn&#39;t make perverted-X evil, just perverted.  The honor and nobility owed to those who serve can be given, but isn&#39;t necessarily owed, and certainly isn&#39;t owed in the same way, to those who serve for money.  Yes, I understand I&#39;m splitting hairs here, as many of the people who enlist in mercenary groups are former military ... but in my experience, they&#39;re not formerly military looking to score college funds.  They&#39;re looking for a six-figure pay check for a few months of dangerous work, which is what people do to make a living, I understand, but it&#39;s not quite the same as serving your country.</p>

<p><em>Unless you mean this matter on mercenaries being perversions of the military and care only to profit from war is what Cameron is pointing out and not you. </em></p>

<p>Well, Cameron&#39;s pointing this out with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer: the ex-Marine is the turncoat-cum-hero who fights the unambiguously evil mercenaries who want nothing more to kill natives in the name of raping the planet.  My drawing the analogy to Blackwater makes the issue about a million times more complicated than it is in the film.</p></span>

<p>Well the political implications of <i>Avatar</i> that SEK points out here matter. He showed why the film is racist but he also showed why the film has a caricatural view of mercenaries. I didn&#39;t know if he agreed with that caricature or not and citing Blackwater made me think he did, but I guess now he was only explaining to the Big Hollywood crew this was not explicitly the American military but a private military. </p></span>

<p>I think I did in fact. Is <i>Hard Boiled</i> (the movie by John Woo? The comic by Frank Miller?) intentionally making an allegory about real live mercenaries the way <i>Avatar</i> is? In this case, it is and SEK explicitly points that out, so in this case it cheering the deaths of mercenaries would be wrongheaded. </p></span>

<p>So, taking pay for a service is somehow inherently ignobling? I don&#39;t buy that at all. One of the effects here in the US of terminating the draft was that the military had to increase pay across the board. I don&#39;t think that in any way decreases the merit of service given by volunteers in the 80s or presently relative to the service given by draftees prior to that. And the same goes for people who&#39;ve chosen to go work for PMCs.</p>

<p><em>In my experience, they&#39;re not formerly military looking to score college funds. They&#39;re looking for a six-figure pay check for a few months of dangerous work, which is what people do to make a living, I understand, but it&#39;s not quite the same as serving your country.</em></p>

<p>What&#39;s your experience? I&#39;ll agree that that&#39;s the motivation of the guys I met in Iraq (november 03 to november 04) who were pumping gas or driving civilian supply trucks. That is, NON-military contractors. But the operators from MPRI (training), Xe (executive protection, force protection, convoy security), and so on that I worked with absolutely were motivated by a desire to serve their country. They just wanted to make better money while they did it, and in some cases to dispense with certain aspects of military culture, which I can certainly understand. &quot;Do what you enlisted to do, but with less mickey mouse and more pay&quot; is a pretty good deal.</p>

I thought that this Higher Nagging would absent itself from my current project, but clearly I was wrong. There I was yesterday, next to a stack of unread comics, and because I had the temerity to be reading a thick late-modernist novel ... &quot;I found myself in France a little more than six weeks after I enlisted. I had no aptitude with the rifle. I could not even bayonet an effigy of Kaiser Bill convincingly. But I was considered 'sharp' and they also discovered that I could run quite fast. So I was selected as company runner, which meant I was also a kind of servant, I forget the word ...&quot; &quot;Batman!&quot; &quot;That is it.&quot; (123) Which is precisely what I was thinking (albeit with a bit more bluster) as I hurled the book across the room.</span></a></div>

The Crowning Moment of Awesome in Return of the Jedi, for example, occurs in the film's first act (as anyone who was five years old and me when he saw it in the theaters will tell you). You wouldn't know that from reading tv tropes. More seriously, I use the site in class to get the kids conversant with the notion of subversion, i.e. that a given scene can be explicitly working to produce the very effect it wants to undermine. For example, in the scene from The Dark Knight in which the Joker fiddles with the detonator, I pull up the entry on the &quot;Unflinching Walk&quot;: When just blowing something up isn't enough, proof of one's apparent badass bombing technique can be seen when the bomber leaves himself barely enough time to escape the blast radius, usually just enough so that as he's walking away, he's silhouetted by the explosion itself. Then we can talk about why Ledger's improvisation worked so brilliantly in a more sophisticated manner (e.g. the lack of an explosion subverts the badassness of the &quot;Unflinching Walk&quot; such that blah blah blah). *That title makes no sense. Sometimes I'm simply slave to the pun. **Not to be confused with the Awesome Moment of Crowning.</span></a></div>
