        <meta name="description" content="Pitchfork and Rolling Stone have both declared Kanye West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy the best album of 2010, but if you read those reviews, you'll note that both of them avoid talking about the core appeal of the album, choosing instead to prattle on about his talents as a producer (which are myriad) or his public persona (which is outrageous) or about a line or two that seems excessive (of which there are many). That the album contains some of the catchiest cuts West has ever produced is merely a sign of his continued development as a musician and his increased confidence as a producer: he'll plink three notes on a piano and loop a &quot;LOOK AT YOU!&quot; because he needs no more than three and is confident enough to speak over the shouting. But that's not why the album appeals: You can ignore all the lyrics of &quot;Runaway&quot; about toasting assholes that will, in fact, be toasted by actual assholes who think themselves worthy of a toast, because the only lyric in that song that matters follows them: &quot;Run away fast as you can.&quot; The infectiousness of the song belies how deeply it hates itself: this is a song about a man imploring someone to flee from his own persona. (And by man I mean Kanye West and persona &quot;Kanye West.&quot;) The entire album consists of braggadocio trying and failing to paper over some fairly large holes in a person. It's the lyrical equivalent of trying to use Saran Wrap to drywall a house—not only does it fail spectacularly, but everyone can see right through it. And that's the album's core appeal: voyeurism. In the wake of his mother's death, West has had numerous public breakdowns. Events and emotions which would (and perhaps should) have remained private instead played themselves on a 24-hour cycle of a stage and West wasn't ever comfortable playing the part. It's almost as if he's comfortable with the idea of playing a part until the moment the spotlight falls on him, at which point no amount of borrowed gamesmanship can make up for the fact that he is a wound as yet unready for the stage. And it's this quality that pervades the album—the fear of failure performed as songs that consistently undermine their narrator's persona. That undermining—the call to &quot;run away&quot; from the person West is perceived to have become—makes his lyrics feel like a transcript from an early (and generally successful) therapy session, and given Americans' deep and abiding love for privacy, it's no wonder the album's reached the critical heights it has. I just wish critics would stop writing around the issue and admit that their desire to peer inside the mind of celebrity is no less salacious than that of the &quot;average&quot; listener, whomever they imagine him or her to be." />

Because I haven't been back to or through Lousiana in over two years, yesterday I was taken aback by the different advertising environment that confronted me on the trip from Houston, TX to Natchez, MS. First, the signage now works according to the general principle: if it's not for a gas station, it's for a fast food place if it's not for a fast food place, it's for a bail bondsman if it's not for a bail bondsman, it's for a strip club if it's not for a strip club, it's for THE LAST ADULT ENTERTAINMENT STORE FOR 70 MILES (as the one sign I remember exactly read). Those are, it seems, the only growth industries along the Texas to Louisiana stretch of the I-10 corridor ... except I also happened to be listening to the Saints game on an AM station from New Orleans, and the commercials played during it were of an entirely different variety. You had: a waste disposal company with the slogan &quot;our business stinks, but it's picking up&quot; a scrap recycling center that bragged that it's been in the recycling business since 1917 a paint company that boasted that it not only sells 1,000 different shades of green, but that its paints are environmentally friendly a restaurant that noted that it was still purchasing its shrimp from green-friendly, local producers despite the BP spill I don't want to draw any general conclusions about the advertising environs, but if we assume that, like Campbell, these people know what they're doing, Louisiana has become an incredibly strange place: everyone's fat and in jail or going to be for crimes committed at or near a strip club, but they're all committed environmentalists. That last bit's the kicker: I was listening to a football game on an AM station when I was being bombarded with advertising designed to appeal to people who care about the environment. I knew the oil spill had changed the minds of many people I'd grown up with — Facebook's handy for tracking such trends — but I hadn't realized how profoundly the environmental disaster had impacted their consciousness. Especially considering that AM radio is some of the lowest hanging fruit in the advertising world ...</span></a></div>

Did one of our guys write ‘Grab your loafers, come along if you wanna, and we’ll blow that shofar for Rosh Hashanah’? No, we didn’t. Christmas is a Christian holiday—if you’re not in the club, then buzz off. Golly gee whiz, Mr. Keillor, if you don't want us to write your songs, we don't want you to use our words.</span></a></div>
