<p>You would be wrong.&#0160; The good folks at <em>Big Hollywood</em> have spent the past week convincing me that if I fail to appreciate the manly awesomeness of <em>The Expendables </em>my penis will fall off.&#0160; The assault on my manhood began on Monday, when Ezra Dulis <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/edulis/2010/08/10/bring-on-the-expendables-welcome-back-stallone-you-were-missed/">reminded me</a> of the true purpose of film itself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rumor has it that Sylvester Stallone’s <em>The Expendables</em> marks a  return to the glory days of 1980s action mayhem and  pro-American  machismo. Its appearance on the cultural horizon has  certainly stirred  up memories of my mid-Eighties, Midwestern suburban  adolescence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fly-over country is back!&#0160; After years of being denied films that  represent the “action mayhem and pro-American machismo” native to  45-year-old white men from the Midwest who once “papered over [their  walls] with posters and photos of oversize he-men,” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Stallone#Early_life">beauty school drop-out and former porn star</a> Sylvester Stallone has directed a film that revels in the fact that the  “inherently brutal nature of males isn’t a design flaw but a  feature.”** But the best part about <em>The Expendables</em>, according to the author of <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/ckozlowski/2010/08/12/film-review-the-expendables-is-ridiculously-entertaining/">the third installment</a> in the series, is that despite being a movie geared toward men who  “love seeing stuff blown up,” there is “relatively little profanity” in  the film.&#0160; Because <em>God-fucking-Forbid</em> someone embodies the inherent brutality of maleness while cursing.</p>
<p>Just ask the author of <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/kschlichter/2010/08/13/bring-on-the-expendables-the-80s-were-a-golden-age-not-the-70s/#more-382553">the most recent entry</a> in the series, Kurt Schlicter, who claims that the 1980s represent the  high watermark in American cinema because of, for example, films like  the “great <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083511/">48 Hours</a></em> (1982), [which] blew minds with violence and profanity.”&#0160; But for  Schlicter, the “archetypal specimen” for manly male films in the 1980s  was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093409/"><em>Lethal Weapon</em></a> (1987), because it was the first movie to prove that Hollywood could do  something correctly; namely, produce “slick popcorn adventure/comedies  with memorable action set-pieces paired  with laugh-out-loud hilarity  and featuring big stars and top shelf  production values.”&#0160; That he  writes this about 1987’s <em>Lethal Weapon</em> despite <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086960/">Beverly Hills Cop</a> </em>having  been released three years earlier is beside the point—as is the fact  that he spends the majority of the review gushing about Mel Gibson—which  is that all of those movies would have improved if, as Darin Miller <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/dmiller/2010/08/13/film-review-scott-pilgrim-pure-fun-from-start-to-finish/">writes</a> of <em>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</em>,  “[e]very F-word [was] bleeped out by a computer game sound effect with a  black bar over the offender’s mouth” and all “references to sex [were]  humorous and relatively innocuous.”***</p>
<p>Granted, pointing out examples of ideological impurity on group blogs is about as difficult as dismantling <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/08/an-accurate-description-of-your-work-requires-adjectives-i-dont-have">a Jonah Goldberg article</a>,  but in this case, where they agree is more significant than where they  don’t.&#0160; That’s because the  to-this-point-exclusively-white-male-contributors of <em>Big Hollywood </em>have spent the past week convincing themselves, to quote from Steven Crowder’s <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/scrowder/2010/08/13/bring-on-the-expendables-violent-cartoons-were-good-for-america/">paean to morally unambiguous children’s fare</a>, that because of <em>The Expendables</em> “it seems that every self-respecting male has caught 80’s fever.”&#0160; His  category of “male” reflects the limitations of his imagination to a  damning degree:</p>
<p>I watched the cartoons he praises and the films the others loved, but  my friends and I have not “resorted to re-visiting old B-movie beauties  such as <em>Cobra, Road House</em> and <em>Tango and Cash</em>” because <em>those are</em> <em>terrible movies</em>.&#0160;  All of these white men are nostalgic for an era in which the category  of “mainstream black film star” only included Eddie Murphy because  they’re unable to muster up much sympathetic identification with black  men more complex than <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=hSf&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22happy+go+lucky%22+darkies+minstrel">happy-go-lucky darkies in a minstrel show</a>.&#0160;  (Which, obviously, isn’t sympathetic identification.)&#0160; In other words,  although these men may not be racist, they certainly pine for a time in  which white actors were more ostentatiously manly and fewer black men  graced the silver screen.****</p>

*Inasmuch as any liberal Jew can ever be.
<p>**I’m not sure “machismo” can be “pro-American” either, but then  again, I’ve never been a Reagan-loving patriot who plastered his wall  with pictures of half-naked men.</p>
<p>***Not that that film is perfect, because as a comment on that thread  indicates, Pilgrim has a “gay roommate,” which is an outrage,  furthering the illusion fostered by the “amount of homosexuals in movies  and tv” that “half the population is gay.”&#0160; I’m almost inclined to  agree: there may not be that many of them, but the gays in film and on  television are truly gigantic.</p>
<p>****And those who did, like Danny Glover, played second fiddle to the likes of Mel Gibson.</p>

I&#39;ve never understood it: it&#39;s the closest thing to a full-bore Greek tragedy ever produced in &#39;80s action garb, possibly in American mainstream movies ever. </p>

<p><i>The Expendables</i> would be artistically interesting if and only if it&#39;s such a quintessentially pure distillation of the white-guy action genre that it allows all those actors to <i>stop making white-guy action films</i> because nothing&#39;s left but self-parody. Or perhaps this <i>is</i> the self-parody that allows them to stop, the way Shatner had to publicly diss Trekkies to be taken seriously. </p>

<p>As for the supposed degendering of children&#39;s television and toys.... have they shopped for children lately? Watched television? It&#39;s worse than ever.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0134863e6c1c970c-content"><p>You seem to hate Expendables for several reasons:<br />
1) The hype-generating marketing machine that has thrown its considerable weight behind a summer blockbuster.  Your annoyance is understandable, but I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s the fault of the film itself.</p>

<p>2) People you don&#39;t like enjoy action-packed, nationalistic, violent movies from the 80s. There&#39;s a quote about Shakespeare actually being good despite the sorts of people who like him.  Saying this is purely the domain of fly-over rednecks is a little broad brush.  Probably the only thing a Midwestern conservative and I would be able to agree upon is Commando.</p>

<p>3) That era of movies overrepresented white men and sidelined black actors from mainstream blockbuster roles.  I&#39;ll completely agree with you here*, and add on the misogyny factor with Temple of Doom, Bloodsport, and so on having a token blonde non-character who can&#39;t do anything right.  Comic books recently went through a similar backlash to &quot;white author nostalgia&quot;: a minority character was killed off to bring back a previous iteration of the character that was Caucasian.  Points similar to the one you make here were brought up; that though the decision was not made from outright racism, there are racist issues inherent in a Caucasian author pining for comics of the era of his childhood and reshaping the landscape to fit this nostalgia.  A difference I&#39;d cite between that case and this one is that the 80s action movie gives us something we haven&#39;t really seen in the current cinematic landscape, whether or not it&#39;s something that suits your taste-- in the case of comics, the change really didn&#39;t add anything.</p>

<p>The 2000s has been a parade of neutered, family friendly rehashes of 80s properties.  In a world where the anticipated meeting of Xenomorphs and Predators in AvP* was a limp, PG-13 affair, can we really say the look back to the heyday of hard R action movies is purely chauvinism? There may be a demand that remains unmet.  Live Free or Die Hard sought to pair one of the most iconic action heroes of the 1980s, John McLane, with the iPod generation via the literal anthropomorphized personification of Apple.  It may turn out that the 80s action movie was produced by a market and a culture that will never be reproduced.  Saying looking back is unnecessary because of the inherent misogyny and racism of the era&#39;s entertainment overlooks what made the era worthwhile at all-- something that won&#39;t be seen while studios make safe PG-13 flicks for teen audiences. I have immense nostalgia for the John Woo blood opera gun battle movies of the 90s, as do many American fans-- rather than immediately ascribe that to Orientalism, wouldn&#39;t a simpler explanation be that due to economic and political factors, there no longer exists a market in which Hong Kong action movies can be made?</p>

<p>*Incidentally, Predator 2, a movie I consider superior to the original, stars Danny Glover.<br />
** While you&#39;re right about Danny Glover playing second fiddle to Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon, I wouldn&#39;t say Lethal Weapon/Beverly Hills Cop is an apples to apples comparison.</p></span>

The Interwebs did, and so arose an opportunity for revision and publication (complete with preapproval from Sim and Gerhard to include panels and pages from the series) in a forthcoming collection. Below is the abstract I concocted while foolishly spending much of my time writing the actual essay, but that's neither here nor there. The close readings of the texts themselves will commence somewhere near the end of this capsule history of what I'm calling &quot;modernist freedom,&quot; but previews of them can be found at the links above. That said: Cerebus and Modernist Freedom When Dave Sim and his fiance, Deni Loubert, founded Aardvark-Vanaheim, Inc. in 1977, its express purpose was to publish Sim's own parody of the sword and sorcery genre typified by titles like Conan the Barbarian and Red Sonja. Two years, twenty-five issues, countless tabs of LSD, and a stint in a psychiatric ward later, his increasingly threadbare parody—later collected in phone book-form as Cerebus—was re-envisioned as a project of almost unimaginable magnitude when the 23-year-old Sim declared that the series would run for 300 issues, at which point he would be 48 years old. For a writer to dedicate 25 years to a single project is not merely unheard of in the domain of serialized comics, but in literature at large, comparable in stamina to the 26 years William Gass labored on The Tunnel and superior in final effect to the nearly half-century in which Ralph Ellison failed to complete Juneteenth. Moreover, Sim rarely had—or, at least, rarely abused—the luxury of stopping production on Cerebus to write essays in the mode of Gass or Ellison, as the schedule required to produce a monthly comic demanded that he work without cessation. Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, the serial nature of monthly comics eliminated the possibility of revision in the traditional sense. Sim could not simply revise a previously unpublished chapter to accord with another of similar status, he had to incorporate previously published material into his increasingly complex cosmology—a feat he accomplished sometimes brilliantly, sometimes not. He possessed, in 1979, the kind of creative freedom editors can afford Grant Morrison today: he could remake this fictional world so that it functioned in accordance with his vision of it. When coupled with the increasingly popularity of his title, this freedom from editorial interference allowed Sim to develop Cerebus solely in reference to his expectations and those of his readers, a financial and artistic arrangement that shares more with that of Continental modernist literature than not. James Joyce knew Ulysses would continue to be serialized in The Little Review because of the number and influence of its subscribers and the unflagging support Sylvia Beach; this knowledge afforded him the opportunity to risk formal and narrative strategies at which an artist lacking it might balk. Despite Joyce's constant anxiety about money—he once wrote his mother, &quot;Your order for 3s 4d of Tuesday last was...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/08/tendentious-people-are-tendentious-and-frequently-dumb.html"><span><strong>Tendentious people are tendentious (and frequently dumb).</strong> It will surprise no one who read my previous post to learn that the folks at Big Hollywood loved The Expendables exactly as much as they are ideologically required to anticipated. Still, John Nolte’s review is a teleological marvel. What he likes about the film is the simple straight-forward plot, all the B-movie mayhem you could possibly ask for, and two unapologetic hours of masculinity—which may be two hours more than we’ve seen in all of the last decade put together. These boys smoke cigars, drink beer while piloting airplanes, and return us to those glorious pre-Oprah days when stoicism was still a virtue and real men didn’t gush about their inner-emotional lives like 13 year-old girls drunk on Dr. Pepper at a slumber party. Maybe someone should tell him that the reason flat characters don’t “gush” about “their inner-emotional lives” is because they don’t have them. Maybe I should. I suppose I will. Please, Mr. Nolte, continue: Sylverster Stallone’s glorious throwback to the brawny 80s is also about something, and it’s not Bourne-ian self-discovery. It’s about something that actually matters. And in this age of nihilism when believing in anything bigger than self is considered old-fashioned, unsophisticated and naïve, that’s both refreshing and important. If you insist on italicizing the word “about,” you might want to indicate what that “something” that it’s about actually is. Sorry, I’m being rude. Mr. Nolte, you may continue: The story opens with a well-crafted action sequence involving Somalia pirates that not only establishes how deadly competent our guys are, but also that they’re not cold-blooded killers. These are men with a moral code and one of their own breaking that code will be the root cause of deadly complications and a couple over the top action sequences to come. So these are mercenaries who only ever fight the good fight? If I may, Mr. Nolte, let me recommend my friend Adam Roberts’s post on Iron Man, in which he notes that that film adheres to the dream narrative of US military involvement in the Middle East: one American is able to go to Afghanistan, kill only the bad Afghans, leave all the good Afghani men women and children alive and leap away into the sky. That “dream narrative” isn’t the product of a moral code, but simply a denial of the reality of reality. But I should let you finish: The plot gets a nudge courtesy of a self-referential Meeting of The Titans. Ever in search of a job, Barney meets with “Church” (Bruce Willis), a CIA spook in need of some housecleaning that won’t make headlines and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a long-time rival. Cinematically this is far from a great scene— First, stop pretending to be German. Second, I think you’re starting to realize that you didn’t even like the film. You call it a “B-movie,” rate its action scenes as “over the top,” and now you’re criticizing how it films a conversation. What did you think of the dialogue? [T]hese aren’t men...</span></a></div>
