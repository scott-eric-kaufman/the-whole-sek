Johnson claims that, narratively, Lost opens in what would be the third act of Back to the Future. Consider: A boy with a head injury wakes up in a bedroom circa 1955. In his hands is a picture. An attractive young woman who's hot for him enters. He eats an awkward dinner with strangers he seems to know then leaves. A short while later, he meets a professor. The boy tells him about the thing the professor had invented that very morning. After a confused conversation, the scene shifts and viewers catch their first glimpse of a modded DeLorean DMC-12 clearly not of 1955 vintage. In this car is a damaged model of the device the professor had invented that morning. The film skips back to the besotted young woman. The boy is trying to set her up with someone else. His motivations are unclear. He stares at the picture and redoubles his efforts . . . Keep spinning that yarn out—slowly revealing the purpose of the flux capacitor, the odd rules governing the DeLorean, and the relation of the boy to the young man and woman—and you end up with the narrative equivalent of Lost.

		<span id="comment-145907730-content"><p>Not x-posted?  Huh.  So this is the exact template for the content that belongs here and nowhere else.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to see the same syndrome in media that are not run by well-paid big shots and that therefore don&#39;t have the opportunity for the same excuses that you give.  Let&#39;s take the Flash game <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/ArmorGames/sonny" rel="nofollow">Sonny</a>, for instance -- mysteriously highly popular among people who like Flash games, for reasons that seem mostly atmospheric in the same sense as why people seem to like <i>Lost</i> et al.  But flash games are written by amateurs, basically, or at least poorly paid professionals, because there is never a lot of money to be made from them.  So, when in <i>Sonny</i>, the first chapter has the protagonist&#39;s dying mentor handing him a cassette tape, telling him urgently to listen to it, and the tape is pretty much forgotten by the end of the second chapter, you have to shrug and say that the game designer just ran out of time or didn&#39;t know how to follow through.</p>

<p>Certainly game-players joked to each other about that tape and what was on it.  And in typical new-media fashion, these fan jokes were incorporated into the next version.  In <i>Sonny 2</i>, which slavishly follows the structure of the first game, Sonny and his sidekick finally get to play the tape at the beginning of the second chapter.  And a song begins to blare as his sidekick says something like &quot;I always said it was probably a mix tape of his favorite tunes.&quot;  But now they think maybe there&#39;s a secret message in it, so Sonny &amp; co are off again.  It&#39;s the use of irony about this same cynicism about whether the writer is making it up as it goes to paper over the fact that the writer is making it up as it goes.</p></span>

<p>I&#39;m inclined to agree.  Off the top of my head, this is certainly the case in Octavia Butler&#39;s novels.  They&#39;re interconnected, but you don&#39;t know how until you read the next novel, which provides the history of genetic tampering that resulted in the future events narrated in the previous novel.  But I do think he&#39;s onto something <em>vis-a-vis</em> serialized television, because series-loyalty is so fickle that a show of this sort that missteps early either never establishes an audience or does only to lose it quickly.  The conversation over at <a href="http://www.thehousenextdooronline.com/2009/01/lost-thursdays-season-5-eps-1-and-2.html" rel="nofollow">The House Next Door</a> is instructive, as Wally (a.k.a. Waxbanks) reveals that he&#39;s about to ditch the show, despite having spent <em>years</em> writing smart dissections of its strengths and weaknesses. </p>

<p><em>So this is the exact template for the content that belongs here and nowhere else.</em></p>

<p>Not <em>exact</em>, Rich, but close.  It&#39;s not political or historical, nor is it literary or literary-historical, so it lands here.  Of course, I just posted something over one of those there that&#39;s also about television, so, um, I&#39;m ending this sentence now.</p>

<p><em>It&#39;s the use of irony about this same cynicism about whether the writer is making it up as it goes to paper over the fact that the writer is making it up as it goes.</em></p>

<p>This is endemic to serialized narratives though, isn&#39;t it?  They either tend to Marvel Comic-type re-imaginings, in which the clutter of continuity is wiped clean then referred to, jokingly, in the newly reconfigured universe; or to <em>Cerebus</em>-style boot-strapping, in which the plan is revealed always to have been the plan, complete with the brand new wall-paper that&#39;s always been there (so long as you don&#39;t read the back issues).  I&#39;m surprised, though, that it&#39;s allowed on a network television show.  What&#39;s the pitch?  &quot;We have half a plan.  You&#39;ll love it!&quot;</p>

<p><em>Really little if anything to do with the post, but I actually am among the apparently small minority who liked Season Six of Buffy. (But then I&#39;m one of the weirdos who liked Dawn, too.) Season Seven, however... Oooof!</em></p>

<p>I don&#39;t actively dislike it, as I did when it was aired, and retroactively it fits into the grander narrative, but at the time?  That season was referred to around these parts as &quot;Once More With Feeling,&quot; as that was all that we saw fit to re-watch for years.  As for season seven, I&#39;m the apostate on that one: everyone would groan when Buffy started speechifying, because they all considered her frequent speeches poorly written attempts to reestablish the character.  Me, I thought they were Buffy trying to look the part so that she might come to feel the part, and as such, they were purposely pathetic and ineffective.  I mean, before every class I pump myself up, try convince myself that I&#39;m The Teacher, then I spend every class trying not to let the class in on the con . . .</p></span>

<p>No, actually something feels new about it.  It&#39;s the laugh at the viewer, really.  Comic book continuity rewrites or boot-strapping always seemed to have a certain seriousness about them, a certain attempt (however doomed to fail) to convince.  Despite <i>Cerebus</i> comic book satire, it, too, wanted you to think that there were jokes, and there were jokes about the rewritten narrative, but there was also serious narrative.  Now there seems to be more and more serials that just joke in a kind of perfunctory, easily ironic way about the narrative, as if to say &quot;What, you expected continuity?  Why should we bother when we know you&#39;ll watch anyways?&quot;  That&#39;s how these shows are pitched to network television as half a plan, I think.  Why bother with a full plan?  Those fans who care will fill one in, more or less.  And having a full plan involves the risk of tedious overplotting, which is much more immediately deadly to a series of this kind.</p></span>

<p>Johnson makes a living saying &#39;contrarian&#39; shit like &#39;<em>Lost</em> is worth watching,&#39; but his praise is, near as I can tell, misguided in every possible way, starting from his definition of &#39;complexity&#39; and moving ever on from there.

It, like so much of the contrived, elongated episodic drivel out there in the vast wasteland, seems too dependent on the same conceit that keeps postmodern thought going. That is if it is mind-bogglingly complicated it must be good or worthwhile. There needs to be a moment of neo-Darwinian &quot;punctuated equilibrium&quot; applied to pop-culture -- a great Burgess Shale die-off -- leaving only the essence of television -- something I imagine boils down to re-runs of <i>Scoobie-Doo</i>. (Zoincs!, that was complicated...).</p></span>

Obama signed an executive order re-viscerating the Freedom of Information Act this morning: The old rules said that if there was a defensible argument for not disclosing something to the American people, then it should not be disclosed. That era is now over. Starting today, every agency and department should know that this administration stands on the side not of those who seek to withhold information but those who seek to make it known. To be sure, issues like personal privacy and national security must be treated with the care they demand. But the mere fact that you have the legal power to keep something secret does not mean you should always use it. The Freedom of Information Act is perhaps the most powerful instrument we have for making our government honest and transparent, and of holding it accountable. And I expect members of my administration not simply to live up to the letter but also the spirit of this law. I will also hold myself as President to a new standard of openness. Going forward, anytime the American people want to know something that I or a former President wants to withhold, we will have to consult with the Attorney General and the White House Counsel, whose business it is to ensure compliance with the rule of law. Information will not be withheld just because I say so. It will be withheld because a separate authority believes my request is well grounded in the Constitution. Let me say it as simply as I can: Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency. I quote at length because, like the boy says, the new administration’s informational. Not so informational as to have the text of the executive orders available to the public yet, but it should only be a matter of time. I write “should” instead of “will” because conservatives might be right: all this could be simple showmanship; that is, Obama could be saying his administration heralds a new era of accountability while squirreling away all the important memos with Cheney’s “Treated as Top Secret/S.C.I.” stamp. But this potential criticism demonstrates why conservatives find themselves in a bind: to make it, they must confess that they believe opacity is a virtue; that the President alone—without the advice of the nation’s chief law enforcement officer—decides how informational his office need be. (All such complaints exercise the same double standard that has conservatives wishing Bush had abrogated the powers he’d concentrated in the executive office before he left it. How will they hash Obama’s apparent willingness to return them to their proper place? By changing the topic.) We can expect, then, that cries of the coming socialism will be bolstered by partisan fiskings of the very facts the Bush administration would’ve withheld from the public. While they may acknowledge the facts themselves, their import will be lost on them because...</span></a></div>

So I thought as long as I'm doing it anyway, I might could help a few folk out. I'm not an expert in film theory, so if you're looking for something along those lines, I suggest you head over to yonder blog and consult its illustrious roll. But if you want a workmanlike approach to teaching basic film vocabulary in a composition class, you could do worse. (Albeit not much.) Because I'm one of those cultural studies loons who believe that popular means culturally significant, the film I'm teaching is The Dark Knight. The scene I've tasked my students to analyze begins 1 hour and 24 minutes into the film. My lesson plan begins after the break: Before I begin, one point to keep in mind: Nolan's camera is always moving in this scene. He employs the conversational shot/reverse shot pattern and edits for continuity, but instead of a static over-the-shoulder shot, Nolan's restless camera slowly circles to the left or right (depending on whose back is to the audience), such that it seems as if Batman and the Joker's heads are on a collision course. More on that in a moment. Let me set the scene: We begin with low-key lighting from two visible sources: the lamp on the desk and the lone lit florescent behind Gordon. To the extent that it even is illuminated, the Joker's face is lit from below: The darkness behind him creates an off-screen space that's foreboding, but ultimately shallow. In the shot above, the Joker asks whether he's about to be treated to &quot;[t]he good cop, bad cop routine?&quot; To which Gordon responds: &quot;Not exactly.&quot; Note how Nolan frames the scene: Gordon within the door; the door within the walls; the walls by the four corner shadows reminiscent of the initial masking of an iris-out. All the compositional elements contribute to the sense of entrapment. But they do so ironically: Gordon is about to open that door. Cut back to the Joker: Nolan places him on the left side of the screen in a medium close-up. As the Joker leans back, Nolan reframes while zooming in for a close-up: As the camera creeps closer the Joker seems to pick up more of the ambient light from the table lamp. Nolan then deepens the shot without refocusing by having someone turn on the rest of the florescent lights: Nolan deepens the dark shallow space to reveal what we didn't know the diagesis contained: the Batman. The restricted depth of field renders the Batman as a blur, but fast things are blurry and the Batman is very fast. (Emphasizing the blurriness likely accounts for why Nolan chose not to use racking focus here.) The camera remains steady as both characters momentarily exit the frame: Not only does the shallowness make the fast blurry...</span></a></div>
