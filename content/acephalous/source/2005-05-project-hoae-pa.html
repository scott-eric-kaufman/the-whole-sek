		<span id="comment-5644282-content"><p>The reason is that each discipline has its own variety of bullshit.  What you&#39;ve stumbled across is an example of sociological bullshit.  Sociological bullshit consists of &quot;reviews of existing scholarship&quot; and bogus pseudo-scientific survey studies that prove what everyone else already knew.  Pure c.v. filler.  Biological and medical bullshit consists of lots and lots of unimaginative experiments with rats that repeat other researchers&#39; experiments with rats.  (&quot;Yep, Prof. X and his team were right - 900 volts does fry the little guys).  Literary bullshit, . . .  well, you already know all about literary bullshit.  Whatever horrible things you can say about literary bullshit, at least it doesn&#39;t kill little rats.  I like rats.  Mind you, literary bullshit is particularly effective at killing braincells, which is arguably just as bad.  However, unless you&#39;re a graduate student taking a seminar with a tenured bullshit artist, you have a choice about whether or not to have your braincells killed by literary studies (i.e., step away from the Homi Bhabha).  Whereas those little rats are pretty much fucked.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-5646912-content"><p>Yes, but Stephen, I think you&#39;ve missed an important distinction.  Bullshit consists of false claims that mislead both the reader and the author himself.  A philosopher named Harry Frankfurt has written a treatise on the subject, which I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t read.  Anyhow, what Acephalous is describing isn&#39;t bullshit, in contrast, say, to Homi Bhabha.  We need a new word for Hodgson&#39;s efforts, and for the efforts of your rat-killing medical researchers.  I would suggest &quot;Bullbarf.&quot;  I.e., it&#39;s essentially regurgitory rather than obfuscatory.</p></span>

As for the second, well, I've been too busy dissertating to think too deeply about what to blog about today, but while I've worn myself out dissertating today, I don't want to stop thinking entirely--I see you, Tom Glavine, but I'm busy thinking--so I'm going to share some of the--quiet, Tom Glavine, sit down--some of the more interesting--TOM GLAVINE!--some of the more interesting things I've, oh, Jesus H. Christ--TOM GLAVINE SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP SO I CAN FINISH THIS SENTENCE! What? THAT'S IT! I'M TAKING OFF THE BELT!--interesting, where was I, what, oh, some stuff. I want to share some stuff. About how identity politics work vis-a-vis ghost stories. Just like orange or fuschia people can't write all that convincing purple or Napoleonic characters, or something, neither can the living write convincingly about the dead, as the advertisement for Jack London's Before Adam in the Sept. 28, 1906 edition of the New York Times attests: Did you ever read a convincing ghost story? You never did, because those who wrote them tried to imagine what a ghost would say. The only way to write a ghost story which will sound real, which will convince, is to be a ghost and write it from the ghost's point of view. Jack London, the writer responsible for this tripe implies, can write about &quot;man before he had any of the veneer of civilization, before society was invented,&quot; because he &quot;has lived a strange life among men and women whose passions are primeval. He has seen men in the raw, stripped down to the mainsprings of life, when only instinctive passions were working--hunger, thirst, revenge, joy--the intensities of life--when vocabulary was simply ejaculation!&quot; Alright... I've learned a valuable lesson: When you pretend you're someone else, gigantic flashing signs screaming &quot;I'm pretending to be someone else&quot; won't cut it. For example: If you say you're &quot;Not the Real President Bush,&quot; you're bound to confuse some people. &quot;Is that the real President Bush?&quot; these easily confused people will wonder. &quot;It says he's 'NTR President Bush,' but then again, that W. said there were WMDs in Iraq. Until I have further evidence that he's not who he says he isn't, I better assume he is.&quot; When they discover that you're not who you say you aren't--&quot;I linked to my homepage, not his,&quot; you thought, &quot;surely even children will understand that there's no deception intended&quot;--they'll be hoppin' mad. &quot;You tricked me!&quot; they'll say. &quot;I thought you were who you said you weren't! You're banned!&quot; Comment #1: You think you ought to read a book 'fore you write about it? No need! Look how accurate-like a review can be by just assumin' you know what some book's 'bout. Like that one by Dick Wright, Native Son, why I tell you it ain't proper for a good ol' boy to lord it up all over the impov'rished by tellin' 'em how great it is...</span></a></div>
