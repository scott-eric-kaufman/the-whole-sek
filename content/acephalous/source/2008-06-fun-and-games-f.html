<p>Jerry Fodor <a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0017.2007.00324.x">steps into the circle</a>:</p><blockquote><p>When [adaptationist explanations of the evolution of heritable traits] work it's because they provide plausible historical narratives, not because they cite covering laws. In particular, <em>pace </em>Darwinists, adaptationism <em>doesn't </em>articulate
the mechanisms of the selection of heritable phenotypic traits; it
couldn't because there aren't any mechanisms of the selection of
heritable phenotypic traits (as such). All there are is the many, many
different ways in which various creatures manage to flourish in the
many, many environmental situations in which the do so. Diamond remarks
that Darwin didn't just present 'a well-thought-out theory of
evolution. Most importantly, he also proposed a theory of causation,
the theory of natural selection.' Well, if I'm right, that's exactly
what Darwin <em>didn't </em>do; a 'theory of causation' is exactly what the theory of natural selection <em>isn't.</em></p></blockquote><p>Well, if he's right, <a href="http://nataliacecire.blogspot.com/2008/05/it-has-long-been-recognized-that-if.html">I'm a scientist</a>.&nbsp; If he's right, we all ought to write totally informally like all the
time.&nbsp; Furthermore, if he's right, well, Daniel Dennett <a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0017.2007.00325.x?cookieSet=1">must be wrong</a>:</p><blockquote><p>As often before, Jerry Fodor makes my life easier, this time by (1) figuring out a persuasive <em>reductio ad absurdum </em>argument
for my views, (2) absolving me of any suspicion that I'm creating a
straw man by resolutely embracing the absurd conclusion, and (3)
providing along the way some vivid lessons in How Not to Do Philosophy.
The only work left for me to do is (a) draw attention to these useful
pedagogical aids, (b) point out the absurdity of Jerry's expressed
position and (c) remind you that I told you so.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Now this really is absurd. Silly absurd. Preposterous. It is
conclusions like this, built upon such comically slender stilts, that
give philosophy a bad name among many scientists. Fodor's argument
really does follow from his premises, though, so far as I can see, so I
am prepared to treat it as a classic <em>reductio. </em>A useful <em>reductio</em>,
as we all learned in our first logic course, has just one bad premise
that eventually sticks out like a sore thumb, but in this case we have
an embarrassment of riches: four premises, all of them false.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Fodor assumes that there is no middle ground, no room for any sort of
gradualism, between, say, the considered goal of an adult philosopher
and the utterly intentionless behavior of, say, a <em>paramecium</em>.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>As I said at the outset, Fodor's paper is a gold mine of Cautionary
Tales with which to scare the very dickens out of the young. Look what
happens, boys and girls, when you try to shoehorn all your arguments
into the form of constructive dilemmas, as if you were doing proofs in
geometry or number theory, where hard edges abound. Look what happens,
boys and girls, when you can't be bothered to look at the actual
science and instead make up all your examples. You can have a jolly
time making fun of the words you put in your imaginary explainers'
mouths, but at the end of the day, you have to return to the real
world, empty handed.</p></blockquote><p>Well now, I don't think Fodor's right.<br /> </p>

<p><a name="2">[2]</a> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">If you 1) haven't but 2) lack the
time to read it, I'll present the short version: People in the
humanities don't really argue anymore.&nbsp; They take perfunctory jabs at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671657151/diesekoschmar-20">acceptable</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226777103/diesekoschmar-20">targets</a> then build their castles in the air.&nbsp; Why can they do this?&nbsp; Because the stakes are so low.&nbsp; They know that unless <a href="http://www.inthemedievalmiddle.com/2008/05/stop-presses-greg-carrier-youre-in.html">Charlotte Allen shows up</a>, the greater world will greet their work with palpable indifference.&nbsp; If Charlotte Allen <em>does</em> show up, they can <a href="http://theruminate.blogspot.com/2008/06/allen-furor.html">safely ignore her</a>
because her work doesn't merit a response.&nbsp; (They're right on the last
count.)&nbsp; The result is an intellectual culture consisting of a million
unrelated conversations trumpeting their own import with such gusto
they never notice the din they inhabit.&nbsp; They may complain about how
few people read their work but fail to acknowledge their complicity in
the culture they actively work to maintain.&nbsp; </span></p>

		<span id="comment-117471272-content"><p>Yeah, the vehemence of Dennett&#39;s response is pretty impressive, especially given that he&#39;s only mentioned sidelong in a footnote.  I hate reading analytic philophy and couldn&#39;t bring myself to read every word of either of their pieces, but as far as I can tell, Dennett&#39;s response boils down to, &quot;Well there <i>are</i> weak forms of intentionalism, <i>idiot</i>.&quot;  That&#39;s all fine and well, but the more direct and meaningful response to Fodor  (says me) would be to point out that adaptation is a metaphor and any talk that natural selection &quot;desires x&quot; is a gramatical convenience for &quot;describes the conditions and structures that tend to produce x.&quot;</p>

<p>I think that Emerson is right about Dennett, but I&#39;m not sure that Fodor is.  The problem with EP folks is not that they think that species agentively wanted to adapt to their environment. Rather, it&#39;s that they think that a) all characteristics represent an adaptational advantage (the Panglossian thing), and b) they can come up with a scientifc explanation/meaningful story about why that would have been so.  If Fodor had elaborated his reverse engineering point, maybe this is part of what he meant.  But even here he goes long-way round with the proof -- seeking to disprove the necessity of reverse engineering, rather than raising problems with it as an epistemology.</p></span>

Every couple of weeks I have to read something Fodor, and to a lesser extent folks like Searle, have written, and I think to myself <i>these are the big names in my field and my work is going to be interpreted by people who take this shit seriously.</i></p></span>

To coin a phrase, accurate and transparent citation of source material is that than which something more disprobative cannot be imagined.</span></a></div>

My mind, being mine, immediately constellated the three and returned a memory of the perfect lyric: &quot;Hey kid, you think that's oil? That ain't oil that's blood.&quot; I wonder what he's thinking when he hit that storm— Or was he just lost in the flood? Then: And some kid comes blastin' round the corner, But a cop puts him right away. He lays on the street holding his leg screaming something in Spanish, Still breathing when I walked away. And somebody said, &quot;Hey man did you see that? His body hit the street with such a beautiful thud.&quot; I wonder what the dude was saying— Or was he just lost in the flood? It sounds better than it looks. But doesn't it look topical? A song about a veteran returned back from the front; the mistaking of blood for oil; a tale about overzealous police employing excessive force. It could be topical. It isn't. Not in the least. But damn is it ever evocative:</span></a></div>
