It spawned careers, studies, experts, college departments, films, laws, hairdos, name changes, federal programs, and so many books. Then came the feminists. They exposed the patriarchial assumptions of black male protest literature. But exposing the shortcomings in protest writing by black men didn't automatically make writing by black women any better. Writers like Alice Walker revealed little more than their own inclination to melodrama, militant self-pity, guilt-mongering and pretensions to mystic wisdom. Enter Toni Morrison: With Song of Solomon, which appeared in 1979, she became a best-selling novelist, proving that the combination of poorly digested folk materials, feminist rhetoric, and a labored use of magic realism could pay off. Beloved is no better: It is designed to placate sentimental feminist ideology, and to make sure that the vision of black woman as the most scorned and rebuked of the victims doesn't weaken. For Beloved, above all else, is a blackface holocaust novel. It seems to have been written in order to enter American slavery into the big-time martyr ratings contest, a contest usually won by references to, and works about, the experience of Jews at the hands of Nazis. That Morrison chose to set the Afro-American experience in the framework of collective tragedy is fine, of course. But she lacks a true sense of the tragic. For all the memory within this book, including recollections of the trip across the Atlantic and the slave trading in the Caribbean, no one ever recalls how the Africans were captured. That would have complicated matters. That's not a bad point. Erasing the role of Africans in the slave trade is a matter of political pragmatism which does strip some formal element of tragedy from the slave trade.

			<p>[<em>Now new and <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/">x-posted</a>!</em>]</p>

<p><em>The New Republic</em>'s &quot;This Week in the Arts&quot; mailer suggested that since &quot;<em>The New York Times </em>recently proclaimed Toni Morrison's <em>Beloved </em>to be 'the single best work of American fiction published in the past 25 years,'&quot; I should check out how <em>TNR </em>reviewed back in 1988.&nbsp; A quick dip in the archives and I was reading &quot;Aunt Medea.&quot;&nbsp; It opens with a misguided slam of James Baldwin.&nbsp; In stunning prose, Baldwin claims</p><blockquote><p>people who cannot suffer can never grow up, can never discover who they are.&nbsp; That man who is forced each day to snatch his manhood, his identity out of the fire of human cruelty that rages to destroy it knows, if he survives his efforts, and even if he does not survive it, something about himself and human like that no school on earth—and, indeed, no church—can teach.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Baldwin may not always be correct, but few sound so good being wrong.&nbsp; According to <em>TNR</em>'s reviewer, with Baldwin</p><blockquote><p>the claim to martyrdom, real or merely asserted, began to take on value.&nbsp; One on longer had to fear the charge of self-pity when detailing the suffering of one's group.&nbsp; Catastrophic experience was elevated.&nbsp; Race became an industry.&nbsp; It spawned careers, studies, experts, college departments, films, laws, hairdos, name changes, federal programs, and so many <em>books</em>.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Then came the feminists.&nbsp; They exposed the patriarchial assumptions of black male protest literature.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>But exposing the shortcomings in protest writing by black men didn't automatically make writing by black women any better.&nbsp; Writers like Alice Walker revealed little more than their own inclination to melodrama, militant self-pity, guilt-mongering and pretensions to mystic wisdom.</p></blockquote><p>Enter Toni Morrison:</p><blockquote><p>With <em>Song of Solomon</em>, which appeared in 1979, she became a best-selling novelist, proving that the combination of poorly digested folk materials, feminist rhetoric, and a labored use of magic realism could pay off.</p></blockquote><p><em>Beloved </em>is no better:</p><blockquote><p>It is designed to placate sentimental feminist ideology, and to make sure that the vision of black woman as the most scorned and rebuked of the victims doesn't weaken. </p>

<p>For <em>Beloved</em>, above all else, is a blackface holocaust novel.&nbsp; It seems to have been written in order to enter American slavery into the big-time martyr ratings contest, a contest usually won by references to, and works about, the experience of Jews at the hands of Nazis.</p>

<p>That Morrison chose to set the Afro-American experience in the framework of collective tragedy is fine, of course.&nbsp; But she lacks a true sense of the tragic.&nbsp; For all the memory within this book, including recollections of the trip across the Atlantic and the slave trading in the Caribbean, no one ever recalls how the Africans were captured.&nbsp; That would have complicated matters.</p></blockquote><p>That's not a bad point.&nbsp; Erasing the role of Africans in the slave trade is a matter of political pragmatism which <em>does </em>strip some formal element of tragedy from the slave trade.&nbsp; Wouldn't it be far more tragic to be sold into slavery by your cousin.&nbsp; Better yet: </p>

<p>A young African woman gives birth to a baby boy who, it has been augured, will one day lead her tribe to victory over the rival tribe to the east.&nbsp; During a raid, she is wounded and disoriented.&nbsp; When she comes to the boy is nowhere to be found.&nbsp; He is presumed dead.&nbsp; He isn't.&nbsp; The tribe to the east kidnapped him and for the next ten years raise him as one of its own.&nbsp; The mother eventually becomes the queen of her tribe.&nbsp; She takes revenge for the &quot;death&quot; of her son by ordering an assault on the tribe to the east.&nbsp; In the course of the attack, her son, the greatest warrior in either tribe, is taken prisoner.&nbsp; After the battle, she orders all the prisoners sold to a Portuguese slave trader bound to America.&nbsp; A few years later, the tribe to the east launches a successful attack on her tribe.&nbsp; The leader of the tribe to the east spares the queen's life long enough to confront her: &quot;Why did you sell your son, the greatest warrior in either tribe, to the white slaver?&quot;</p>

<p>Now <em>that </em>would be a tragedy.&nbsp; The book could continue following the son's brutal life as a slave and then he could die a heartwrenching <em>and </em>properly tragic death.&nbsp; Does Morrison do that?</p><blockquote><p>In <em>Beloved </em>Morrison only asks that her readers tally up the sins committed against the darker people and feel sorry for them, not experience the horrors of slavery as they do.</p></blockquote><p>Apparently she can't even get the heartwrenching part right:</p><blockquote><p>Morrinson, unlike Alice Walker, has real talent, an ability to organize her novel in a musical structure, deftly using images as motifs; but she perpetually interrupts her narrative with maudlin ideological commercials.</p></blockquote><p>She could write a heartwrenching novel were it not for her desire to insert bold ideological statements in her book.&nbsp; In classic creative writer's argot: she tells instead of showing.&nbsp; &quot;<em>Beloved </em>reads largely like a melodrama lashed to the structural conceits of the miniseries.&quot;&nbsp; Ouch.</p><blockquote><p>Were <em>Beloved </em>adapted for television (which would suit the crass obviousness that wins out over Morrison's literary gift at every significant turn) the trailer might go like this:</p>

<p>&quot;Meet Sethe, an ex-slave woman who harbors a deep and terrible secret that has brought terror into her home.&nbsp; [Adolescent sons are shown fleeing.]&nbsp; Meet Paul D, who had a passion for Sethe when they were both slaves, but lost her to another.&nbsp; [Sethe shown walking with first husband Halle, smilin as Paul D looks on longingly.]</p></blockquote><p>The parody continues on far longer than its enabling conceit actually allows.&nbsp; The reviewer's point is that &quot;Morrison almost always loses control&quot; and that &quot;she can't resist the temptation of the trite or sentimental.&quot;&nbsp; The stuff of miniseries.&nbsp; The final evaluation?</p><blockquote><p>Too many attempts at biblical grandeur, run through by Negro Folk rhythms, stymie a book that might have been important.</p>

<p>Yet to render slavery with aesthetic authority demands not only talent, but the courage to face the ambiguities fo the human soul, which transcend race.&nbsp; Had Toni Morrison that kind of courage, had she the passion necessary to liberate her work from the failure of feeling that is sentimentality, there is much she could achieve.&nbsp; But why should she try to achieve anything?&nbsp; The position of literary conjure woman has paid off quite well.&nbsp; At last year's PEN Congress she announced that she had never considered herself American, but with <em>Beloved </em>she proves that she is as American as P.T. Barnum.</p>

<p>STANLEY CROUCH</p></blockquote><p>Stanley Crouch?&nbsp; STANLEY CROUCH?&nbsp; I knew this argument sounded familiar.&nbsp; However, this little exercise says something favorable taking arguments seriously.&nbsp; That bit in the middle about Morrison's failure to face the larger tragedy of slavery strikes me as somewhat compelling.&nbsp; May even account for why I prefer Charles Johnson's <em>Middle Passage </em>to <em>Beloved.&nbsp; </em>The <em>reductio </em>of Crouch's argument could be entertaining:</p><blockquote><p>THE HORROR!&nbsp; (<em>points to the east</em>)&nbsp; THE HORROR!&nbsp; (<em>points to the west</em>)&nbsp; THAT HORROR TOO!&nbsp; (<em>points to the south</em>)&nbsp; AND THAT ONE!&nbsp; (<em>points to the north</em>)&nbsp; ALMOST FORGOT THAT ONE!&nbsp; (<em>points to the southeast</em>)&nbsp; NO DOUBT!<br /> </p></blockquote>

		<span id="comment-17690667-content"><p>I guess Crouch delivered a verbal punch in the face rather than the actual ones he&#39;s so notorious for giving. </p>

<p>Stephen Metcalf, diletantte at large for slate.com, also takes on Beloved&#39;s preeminence on the NYT list (<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2141971/)." rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/id/2141971/).</a> He argues that the novel is so well regarded because the novel&#39;s commitment to &quot;therapeutic self-renewal&quot;  in response to a personal trauma fits in perfectly with the burgeoning culture of self-help and actualization. One need look no further for evidence than the scene in the clearing with Baby Suggs where she tells her congregation to love themselves because no one else will. This passage is the final scene of the movie adaptation starring none other than Oprah Winfrey.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-17714505-content"><p>It&#39;s pretty intriguing to be treated to the spectacle of Crouch complaining that <i>Beloved</i> elevates suffering and Metcalf complaining, almost twenty years later, that it downplays it. And complaining, no less, that <i>Beloved</i> has a &quot;Land of Cockaigne&quot; sensibility because its slave characters actually manage to find a place where they can cook, bed down and make ends meet. (No doubt a different line of ideological attack should have been possible had Morrison been careful to strip away any hint of such comforts.) </p>

<p>Which is not to say that Metcalf&#39;s point is totally implausible (or for that matter, totally convincing). But man oh man. The &quot;<i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> started the Civil War, what has <i>Beloved</i> done?&quot; riff: dumb, dumb, dumb. (Do tell us, sir Metcalf, have de Lillo and Updike started any civil wars, lately? Is that really how you want to assess literary merit? Of course it isn&#39;t.) Reminds me why most lit theorists don&#39;t focus on &quot;taste&quot; and so-called &quot;love of literature&quot; any more... and why that&#39;s probably a good thing.</p></span>

The day after being called one of the better academic bloggers around I completely punt a post about academia. I either overthought what should've been a breezy blog or underthought what should've been a substantial article. Or both. So here are the contradictory points I wanted but failed to address yesterday: Some people (Greenblatt) teach the works they love (Shakespeare) better than those they don't. Other people (me) teach the works they love (Didion) worse than those they don't. (Critical eyes being more easily turned toward works we don't altogether like.) Some people (CR) have a love which drives their intellectual production. Other people (me) have an interest which drives their intellectual production. Thus: Some people (me) should be more drawn to Theory than other people (CR). Other people (CR, Laura, Marco) should be more drawn to the &quot;amorous historicism&quot; Caleb Crain discussed in his n+1 essay. (Yet the opposite seems true.) Adam is a Grammar Nazi. The problem? All of these statements (sans #4) are oversimplifications. The other problem? All of these issues (sans #4) are related in some fundamental fashion. The other other problem? I'm tackling these issues (sans #4) as &quot;successfully&quot; as I do an argument with eighteen planks and countless unstated premises. That is: Poorly. Yet the desire to encompass it all immediately overwhelms. I don't know where to start but I desperately want to finish. Not at all unlike writing a dissertation chapter. (Note to all paying attention: still not finished.) This all ties into the thread without end John's hosting. Were I not oddly reluctant to tackle any of these issues individually I could probably sort through it in a way that would make them meaningful to others. (Is this the sort of blog noodling people are always complaining about?)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/piracy_studies.html"><span><strong>Piracy Studies</strong> The joke isn't even mine. But someone has ventured over here from Long Sunday approximately too-many-times-to-count tonight so I'll venture a reprint. Jodi suggested the creation of Department of Piracy Studies. I provided some ink for their brochure: Scholars of Piracy Studies explore and develop theoretical models to analyze, critique, and plunder cultural forms and social relations in order to create geographically transgressive symbolic categories of race, gender, and ethnic identity. The goal of the Piracy Studies Institute is to promote the study of shared assumptions, problems, and commitments of the various piratanical discourses. Begun largely in response to extraordinary changes in the 'humane sciences,' both in terms of methodological complexity and interdisciplinary orientation, the PSI seeks to bring about a confrontation among the disciplines with the aim of furthering the figurative and literal rape of all land-locked peoples irrespective of race, class, or gender. The PSI sanctions methodological and murderological diversity in the critical reconsideration of the rearticulations and recombinations of all them put to the knife. The PSI also sponsors two mini-seminars each year, given by scholars from outside the PSI who invite students to participate in their raids-in-progress in a series of a one- to two-week seminars at undisclosed locations up-and-down the Eastern Seaboard. Now you can get your Piracy Studies right from the secondary source and Bob's your uncle!</span></a></div>
