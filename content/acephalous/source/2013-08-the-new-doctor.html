			<p>As anyone who cares enough to be reading this already knows, yesterday the BBC announced that it had <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23570354">cast the new Doctor</a>, and to the shock of absolutely no one paying attention, he looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/newdoctor.jpg"><img alt="" height="305" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/newdoctor.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="newdoctor" width="399" /></a></p>
<p>I confess to being disappointed: I’d hoped to see Idris Elba fulfil 
the Doctor’s wish of regenerating ginger—yes, you read that correctly—because a show whose operative principles are any thing, any where, any
 time shouldn’t limit its protagonist to white men from the British 
Isles. Endlessly doing so constitutes a failure of imagination on the 
part of a show predicated on imaginative possibility. I’m not claiming 
the new Doctor had to be a black man. Neil Gaiman introduced into canon 
the concept of regenerating into another gender in “The Doctor’s Wife,” 
so I would’ve been satisfied with a white woman.*</p>
<p>Essentially, I wanted Steven Moffat to make a selection as 
outrageously ambitious as the show itself can be, and Peter Capaldi is 
more of the same. Which isn’t to say he’ll be a terrible Doctor, as 
Capaldi’s a fine actor and will bring to the role a gravitas it’s lacked
 since the end of David Tennant’s run. But as heroes go, the Doctor’s 
just “a madman with a box” whose power, such as it is, is the ability <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/11/doctor-who-the-pandorica-opens.html">to bluff his way out of a war</a>. And as powers go, “intelligence” is limitless in its potential appeal <em>because everyone likes to think they’re smart</em>.
 Having him embodied by an endless parade of white British males creates
 an unwholesome and unnecessary connection between intelligence, acts of
 extreme whiteness and penises.</p>
<p>Why does that matter? I’ll tell you the same story I told <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/doctor-who/">my <em>Doctor Who </em>class</a> when trying to explain its cultural significance to the British people:</p>
<p>One evening while I was trapped in North London by an Icelandic 
volcano, I noticed the streets were unusually empty. The hundreds of 
Pakistani children usually found playing in the street had vanished, so I
 decided to take advantage of the quiet and read on the front porch. 
About five minutes later, the Pakistani family that lived next door 
returned home from wherever they’d been and went inside. Five minutes 
after that, another Pakistani family from down the street walked up to 
and in my neighbor’s house. Five minutes after <em>that</em>, another 
Pakistani family, this one completely unfamiliar to me, did the same. 
This continued for about an hour, until the house was packed well beyond
 capacity.** I had no idea what was going on, so when one of the 
children I recognized was walking up, I asked.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“The Doctor,” he said.</p>
<p><em></em>Imagine what the atmosphere in that house would be like if 
Matt Smith regenerated into someone who resembled them. Because that’s 
all you can do, <em>imagine</em>, for the time being.</p>
<p>*I’ve read that some are disappointed that the Doctor will be 
straight again. I sympathize—though the series deserves credit on that
 front for Captain Jack—but unless they have access to scripts Moffat 
hasn’t written yet, I’m not sure why anyone would conclude from 
Capaldi’s casting that the Doctor will be straight.</p>
**Writing this story down is, believe it or not, the first time I’ve ever realized that <em>the house was bigger on the inside</em>.
 I’ve always worried people would think I was making some sort of 
derogatory statement about the living conditions of Pakistanis, when I 
should’ve been making it clear that they have a TARDIS and we don’t.

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0192ac67ed82970d-content"><p>This is somewhat beside the point, but if you actually thought that Idris Elba was going to be cast, you&#39;re mental.  Its cultural significance and centrality aside, Doctor Who is a <i>regular BBC drama</i>, which means that the lead actor has to commit to showing up -- on set and at a variety of locations around the British Isles and occasionally further afield -- every day for several months, and he&#39;s going to be paid BBC wages to do it.  In addition, whoever plays the Doctor is signing on for minimally weeks to months of promotional work: fan conventions, photo shoots, etc etc.  And because re-casting the role is such a heartache for everyone involved in the production staff, the BBC wants a multi-year commitment.</p>

<p>None of which is even slightly compatible with <i>also</i> shooting 3-4 Hollywood feature films a year.  In fact, based on Eccleston and Tennant&#39;s luck so far, it may be one of the surer ways to flat-out kill a promising career in Hollywood.  Elba&#39;s Hollywood career hasn&#39;t reached Tom Cruise levels yet, but he&#39;s looking like he&#39;s on that track, and his commitments there have limited the last two series of Luther to 4-6 episodes a year: Doctor Who averages 2-3 times that.<br />
 <br />
TL;DR -- Elba doesn&#39;t have the time, and the BBC could never afford what they&#39;d need to pay him to clear his schedule.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0192ac6c9e85970d-content"><p>As I understand it, the role <i>was</i> offered to a black actor before Capaldi, but the actor turned it down (and doesn&#39;t want to go public about it). <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/doctor-who/10227458/Doctor-Who-writer-Neil-Gaiman-A-black-actor-turned-down-the-role.html" rel="nofollow">I believe Gaiman broke that news</a>. So there&#39;s that.  </p>

<p>Take this for what it&#39;s worth, but Rob Bricken at IO9 attempted to forge a &quot;<a href="http://io9.com/a-unified-theory-to-explain-the-casting-of-every-new-do-1054287288" rel="nofollow">unified theory to explain the casting of every new Doctor Who</a>&quot; that posits stages of the rebooted Doctor Who that need to be gone through before this iteration of the program is free to go in other directions (and Bricken was similarly hoping for a gender or ethnic change-up, so this is in retrospect). The short version is the original Doctor went through some historic stages that we can recognize, and the new Doctor is working through similar layered stages while modernizing in order to break free of its past: The Dark Doctor (Eccelston); The Charismatic Doctor (Tennant); The Weird Doctor (Smith); and The Elder Doctor (Capaldi). After Capaldi, the Doctor has been rounded out to resonate with the original Doctor characters, and anything goes. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m in agreement with those that do <i>not</i> want to see Moffat writing a female Doctor. He can barely handle female cyphers.</p>

<p>At this point, I&#39;m most concerned with what his new catchphrase will be. If Capaldi plays him Scottish, there&#39;s always <i>OCH! GUID!</i> Or maybe <i>OAN YE GO BIG MAN!</i> If Capaldi channels his inner Malcolm Tucker, then there&#39;s <i>Omnishambles</i>, <i>FUCK!</i> (probably not), or maybe when someone&#39;s trying to get into the Tardis, he can pull out the classic <i>Come the fuck in or fuck the fuck off!</i></p></span>

There’s a baroque grandeur to the pattern of perceived slights that’s admirable in its own way — as if a master archer decided to “paint” a pointillist self-portrait one arrow at a time. The style of contemporary conservatives is equally absurd, but it lacks the pointless beauty of paranoia — it’s akin to child who tosses a handful of bird shot into a lake and finds in the resulting ripples a fair resemblance of himself. By insisting his reflection is the result of his “artistry,” he communicates that he fundamentally misunderstands the nature of causality. Put differently: if he pissed on a mirror he’d crow about the transmogrifying powers of his urine. Because he’s not paranoid — he’s an idiot. He’s out there kicking a watch to prove to David Hume that God designed the world to exist. At The National Review, for example, Stanley Kurtz recounts reading a book by James Kloppenberg in which Mike Kruglik “recalls that Obama had a special interest in the work of the radical historian Howard Zinn” in 1985. I had to add the date because Kurtz didn’t want to sully Kloppenberg’s account of Kruglik’s twenty-eight year old recollection of Obama’s “special interest” with its proper context. Had he done so, Paul Mirengoff of Powerline wouldn’t have been able to draw attention to “The Obama-Zinn Connection,” nor would he have been able to transform Obama’s “special interest” into overt “fan[dom],” and if he couldn’t call Obama a “fan” of Zinn, he couldn’t link to The National Review‘s “summar[y]” of “Zinn’s errors and distortions.” This isn’t paranoia — grandiose or otherwise — it’s the self-fulfilling stupidity of three kids kicking a turtle they’ve mistaken for a watch who think they’re proving God and Samuel Johnson right. They’re not exactly sure how they’ve done so, but they’re damn sure that they have because it looks just like them.</span></a></div>

(And the article's about vodka no less.) In addition to writing articles, my duties at The Raw Story will include pulling and titling links to wire stories. They won't be under my byline, but I have a feeling you'll be able to tell which ones are mine. I'll still be writing here, though, as my job doesn't entail the kind of editorializing I'm incapable of not doing. As a matter of fact, I'll still be here when my other other gig starts on the 15th. (But more on that later.)</span></a></div>
