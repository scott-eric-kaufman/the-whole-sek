        <meta name="description" content="At 8 a.m. on the morning of 16 June 1904, two men woke up. One shaved for class and breakfasted with his usurper and an anti-Semite. The other, a Jew, purchased a pork kidney and serves it to his wife in the same bed in which she cuckolded him. He left to pick up a letter from his secret sweetheart and chatted with the people he met on his way to the baths. Once clean, he attended a funeral and saw a mysterious man. After the funeral, he tried to place an advertisement in a local newspaper but decided more research was required, so he scooted off to the library where, unbeknown to him, the first of our two men was disquisiting on Shakespeare. Many people walked around, including our Jew, who decided to follow his morning kidney with an afternoon liver. He ogled the barmaids and thought about his wife who, if his suspicions were correct, would soon be cuckholding him again. So he exited the bar with the pretty reminders of his pain and entered another full of anti-Semites. Fists and cans were thrown. Troubled by thoughts of wife and ancient grievances, he wandered seaside way and publicly co-masturbated with a cripple. He later attended the birth of a child and the English language before following our first man into the red-light district. He caught up with him, himself, himself-in-drag, his dead grandfather, Nobodaddy, a giant green crab, a talking hat-stand and ducked out when the police arrived. Chastened, the two men entered a dive and met a drunken sailor. They absconded to the home of the Jew and bonded while urinating under the stars. As 16 June 1904 came to a close, the Jew returned to his troubled marital bed and asked his wife to serve him breakfast in it tomorrow. She considered his request but never decided one way or the other. (Happy Bloomsday. Sorry about the spoilers.)" />

<p>This is off topic, for which I apologize, but it occurs to me you might know whether my vague memory of reading a Mark Twain short story about some guy who goes around selling lightning rods is something that I just dredged up from the dark recesses of my often very random mind, or if it corresponds to an actual real story that I might be able to find somewhere.</p></span>

<p>She doesn&#39;t touch herself. Pretty sure Bloom would have noticed if she had. And it follows that it&#39;s just a little odd to imagine that what we get at mid-chapter is her coming. He&#39;s coming, certainly. But she comes from giving a peek? Hmmm... </p>

<p>I&#39;ve written something about this that you can find if you knows my name. Bloom&#39;s special kink is imagining his way into female&#39;s minds. (the ad with the woman writing etc...) Which, of course, is also often the male novelist&#39;s kink. </p>

<p>But seriously, they are not co-masturbating in any viable sense of the term. Self-exposure is not &quot;masturbation.&quot; Sorry to be pedantic about it, but I really do think you miss the sense of Nausicaa if you blur this up. </p></span>

This is not an average day: it is a VERY BAD DAY. Which is why we celebrate it! And what&#39;s a celebration without nits? They&#39;re the party favors in the pinata of discourse.</p>

The Real World holds the dubious honor of being first in the post-1990 tsunami of reality television. The premise was simple: seven strangers were picked to live in a house &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and start being real. The show never tried to live up to its name. Canny viewers could watch the manufactured controversies being produced in the booth weeks before hostilities spontaneously erupted. But! The pretense of the show was that it was unscripted and unrehearsed. It was not some sitcom filmed in a West Hollywood back-lot in which a middle-class family dealt with generic adolescent, senescent, menopausal and mid-life crises to the pitch-corrected laughter of the ideal studio audience. It was real. So you can imagine my surprise when I flipped on the latest installment of The Real World and discovered it was being filmed in a West Hollywood back-lot. In a move forever granting Fredric Jameson the right to claim he told us so, The Real World: Hollywood is filmed in the same building in which CBS once shot I Love Lucy. Should we tell him this? What are the odds he watches The Real World? It's not like he even values empirical verification ...</span></a></div>

The first two lines are easy enough to improve — drop the “that” and “and energy to,” or maybe “time and … to” — but the third and fourth are a mess, but one with potential. I’d love to find a way to squeeze the bureaucratize of “official gatherings of descendants of Thomas Jefferson” into a single line, but alas, I’m doomed to failure. So not a well-crafted poem, but a poem nonetheless. Only not. (And yes, I need new glasses.)</span></a></div>
