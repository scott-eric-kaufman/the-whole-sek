        <meta name="description" content="After a series of answers in which Speaker Boehner distances himself from Michele Bachmann’s paranoid concerns about the infiltration of our government by agents of the Muslim Brotherhood, this exchange occurs: Q: Would you consider taking her off the Intelligence Committee? Congresswoman Bachmann? JOHN BOEHNER: I don’t know that that’s related at all. Nor do I. It’s not like the Intelligence Committee is tasked to oversee “the intelligence and intelligence-related activities of 17 elements of the US Government, and the Military Intelligence Program.” It’s not as if a person on said committee sending a letter full of undocumented slanders and strange accusations of cultural capitulation has anything to do with intelligence — either in its governmental or colloquial sense. It’s not like the letter to Inspector General Charles McCullough contains material lifted from the splash page of this website or anything. It’s not as if the letter to Acting Inspector General Lynne Halbrooks demonstrates a “serious concern” about how the government labels things. Except the Halbrooks letter demands an investigation into: The failure of the Army in the aftermath of the Fort Hood massacre to characterize the jihadist motivations of the alleged shooter, a self-declared “Soldier of Allah” Major Nidal Hassan. This was compounded by the after-action investigation which did not even describe the incident as an example of “violent extremism” — the government’s approved euphemism for obscuring jihadism. The use of euphemisms, this letter contends, “may even pose security risks for this nation, its people, and interests.” This makes perfect sense: if I say nothing when they come for my language, I won’t be able to complain when they impose shariah law because they already took my language. Policing language is very important to the authors of these letters, as evidenced by a demand for a corrective action, consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States , to ensure that no Muslim Brotherhood associated entity or individual is placed in a position of honor or trust within the programs and operations of the Department of Defense unless he or she has publicly condemned and disclaimed previously stated goals of the Muslim Brotherhood. They must “publicly condemn.” They want to make some unnamed (and all future) people prove they’ve uprooted some thoughts from their heads. In words. (Presumably before the Brotherhood takes them away.) Failure to do so might “unnecessarily expose U.S. personnel [in Afghanistan] to hostile action and diseases.” They must be made to say the words, or Our Troops might catch diseases. The vector of these hypothetical diseases? Doesn’t matter. It could happen. If none of this makes much sense to you, consider it a compliment, because none of these letters make sense. The boilerplate questions that conclude all of them can be summed up thus: Is anyone under you a Secret Muslim, and if so, has he or she publicly renounced their commitment to “civilization jihad”? What is the current relationship of your Secret Muslims to the Muslim Brotherhood? Have you taken the “corrective action”..." />

			<p>After a series of answers in which Speaker Boehner distances himself from Michele  Bachmann’s paranoid concerns about the infiltration of our government by  agents of the Muslim Brotherhood, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2012/07/19/548671/boehner-blasts-bachmann-says-her-unfounded-accusations-are-pretty-dangerous/">this exchange occurs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Would you consider taking her off the Intelligence Committee? Congresswoman Bachmann?</p>
<p><strong>JOHN BOEHNER:</strong> I don’t know that that’s related at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor do I. It’s not like the Intelligence Committee is <a href="http://intelligence.house.gov/about/history-jurisdiction">tasked to oversee</a> “the intelligence and intelligence-related activities of 17 elements of  the US Government, and the Military Intelligence Program.” It’s not as  if a person on said committee sending a letter full of undocumented  slanders and strange accusations of cultural capitulation has anything  to do with intelligence — either in its governmental or colloquial  sense. It’s not like the letter to Inspector General Charles McCullough  contains material lifted from <a href="http://muslimbrotherhoodinamerica.com">the splash page of this website</a> or anything. It’s not as if the letter to Acting Inspector General  Lynne Halbrooks demonstrates a “serious concern” about how the  government labels things. Except the Halbrooks letter demands an  investigation into:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The failure of the Army in the aftermath of the Fort Hood  massacre to characterize the jihadist motivations of the alleged  shooter, a self-declared “Soldier of Allah” Major Nidal Hassan. This was  compounded by the after-action investigation which did not even  describe the incident as an example of “violent extremism” — the  government’s approved euphemism for obscuring jihadism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of euphemisms, this letter contends, “may even pose security  risks for this nation, its people, and interests.” This makes perfect  sense: if I say nothing when they come for my language, I won’t be able  to complain when they impose shariah law <em>because they already took my language</em>. Policing language is very important to the authors of these letters, as evidenced by a demand for a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>corrective action, consistent with the Constitution and  laws of the United States , to ensure that no Muslim Brotherhood  associated entity or individual is placed in a position of honor or  trust within the programs and operations of the Department of Defense  unless he or she has publicly condemned and disclaimed previously stated  goals of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They must “publicly condemn.” They want to make some unnamed (and all  future) people prove they’ve uprooted some thoughts from their heads. <em>In words</em>.  (Presumably before the Brotherhood takes them away.) Failure to do so  might “unnecessarily expose U.S. personnel [in Afghanistan] to hostile  action and diseases.” They must be made to say the words, or Our Troops  might <em>catch diseases</em>. The vector of these hypothetical diseases? Doesn’t matter. It <em>could </em>happen.</p>
<p>If none of this makes much sense to you, consider it a compliment,  because none of these letters make sense. The boilerplate questions that  conclude all of them can be summed up thus:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is anyone under you a Secret Muslim, and if so, has he or she publicly renounced their commitment to “civilization jihad”?</li>
<li>What is the current relationship of your Secret Muslims to the Muslim Brotherhood?</li>
<li>Have you taken the “corrective action” described above against your Secret Muslims yet?</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow the logic! Some Representatives are asking various Inspector Generals <em>to root out the Muslim spies in their respective organizations</em>,  but this activity is “unrelated” to the House Intelligence Committee,  because it’s only about a secret plot to destroy the United States by  “civilization jihad.” Would Speaker Boehner have us believe that spying  is “unrelated” to intelligence?</p>
<p>Apparently so.</p>

No, why Bain?</strong> By now, you’ve already heard too much about this ridiculous story: Have you heard this new movie, the Batman movie, what is it, The Dark Knight Lights Up or whatever the name is. That’s right, Dark Knight Rises. Lights Up, same thing. Do you know the name of the villain in this movie? Bane. The villain in The Dark Knight Rises is named Bane, B-a-n-e. What is the name of the venture capital firm that Romney ran and around which there’s now this make-believe controversy? Bain. The movie has been in the works for a long time. The release date’s been known, summer 2012 for a long time. Do you think that it is accidental that the name of the really vicious fire breathing four eyed whatever it is villain in this movie is named Bane? To answer the question that’s asked, it’s no coincidence at all, because of this: But that’s beside the point. The real question—the one that no one seems to be asking—is why Bain? I know the real reason is ego cheap and clean, but it boggles the mind that these titans of industry decided that their public face should be the homonym of a word which means, according to my Oxford English Dictionary, 1. A slayer or murderer; one who causes the death or destruction of another. 2. a. That which causes death, or destroys life. b. Poison. Also in comb. in names of of poisonous plants or substances, as in Dogbane, Henbame, Leopard’s Bane, Rat’s Bane, Wolf’s Bane, etc. 3. Murder, death, destruction. 4. That which causes ruin, or is pernicious to well-being: the agent or instrument of ruin or woe, the ‘curse.’ 5. Fatal mischief: woeful or hapless fate. 6. A disease in sheep, the ‘rot.’ Which means that a group of seemingly intelligent people—at least as judged by their inherited wealth—sat around in a board room one day and decided to christen their corporation with a name whose most positive association is “[a] disease in sheep, the ‘rot.’” The fact that any of their failures could be accurately described as having been “the agent or instrument of ruin or woe, the ‘curse’” never seems to have passed their respective minds. It’s the equivalent of opening a company called We Exploit Child Labor for Great Profit, then wondering why no one seems to want to buy your jeans. And yet one of the minds responsible for this feels himself qualified to serve as the Executive Brand of the United States of America? He’ll homonously be the bane of America as much as he and his party literally are.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/07/a-deal-that-you-people-can-agree-to.html"><span><strong>A deal &quot;that&quot; &quot;you people&quot; can agree to?</strong> If those on the right stop insisting that the antecedent of Obama's &quot;that&quot; was &quot;business&quot; when it was clearly &quot;roads and bridges&quot; and sundry, those of us on the left will recognize that the subject of Ann Romney's &quot;you people&quot; was clearly the mainstream media. Work for you? Of course not. As to Obama: If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business, you didn’t build that. Antecedents can co-refer across sentence boundaries in English. They just can. (See what I did there?) Moreover, the nearest potential antecedent to a pronoun isn't necessarily the actual antecedent. Consider: The monkey took the banana and ate it. The monkey became sick after it ate the banana. In both cases &quot;the banana&quot; is closer to &quot;it&quot; than &quot;the monkey&quot; is, but in the first sentence &quot;it&quot; refers to &quot;the banana,&quot; whereas in the second sentence &quot;it&quot; refers to &quot;the monkey.&quot; This isn't that difficult people. The &quot;this&quot; in the previous sentence? It doesn't even have a referent. It refers back to the situation of entire text. Now it's doing so over three sentence. It can do it over four. It can do so to infinity if I so choose. That's just how it works. In short: Neither inclusion in the same sentence nor proximity to a pronoun is definitive proof that Obama's &quot;that&quot; refers to &quot;business,&quot; and context makes a strong case that Obama's &quot;that&quot; referred across more than one sentence to a catalog of antecedents including &quot;somebody,&quot; &quot;a great teacher,&quot; another &quot;somebody,&quot; the &quot;American system,&quot; yet another &quot;somebody,&quot; and &quot;roads and bridges.&quot; &quot;That&quot; refers to all that in the same way the second &quot;that&quot; in this sentence does. Simple as that. As to Ann Romney: the phrase &quot;you people&quot; only works as an epithet when it's directed at someone. If I write that I'm going to tell you people about &quot;you people,&quot; none of you people will be offended because I wasn't trying to diminish you people by calling you &quot;you people.&quot; If Mitt Romney had said &quot;you people&quot; during his speech to the NAACP, that'd be a different story. But Ann Romney was being interviewed on ABC News, meaning &quot;you people&quot; clearly refers to the mainstream media so beloved by conservatives everywhere. Which means she might have been using it as an epithet targeted at the mainstream media establishment.
