		<span id="comment-149792159-content"><p>I have had lifelong insomnia that presents as an obsession with delivering lectures. From the time I was a child, I would lie awake most of the night composing lectures on books I was reading. I had never heard a lecture on literature, so I suppose they were probably more like sermons (and I composed several of those, too). I planned to be a scientist or a doctor, so I don&#39;t know what I was imagining these lectures for. (I was also painfully shy and couldn&#39;t imagine talking to a group of people.) But eventually, when I started teaching, it meant that I never prepared written notes for lectures; I just composed them before falling asleep whether I wanted to or not. </p>

<p>Of course, lecturing is considered pretty undesirable by the pedagogy of our times, so I try to keep them short, but I am an absurdly good lecturer. My skill is not wanted! The only thing that keeps me from writing lectures is playing a little solitaire (or sudoku or Tetris or other boring little solo game) before bed, and my brain invents games of it to solve while I try to fall asleep. Very annoying, yes, but boring enough that I eventually sleep.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-149811289-content"><p>Whenever I&#39;ve had insomnia, it&#39;s been because I cut out something important from my daily routine.  That hour at the gym; that hour of playing guitar; that conversation with someone important I&#39;ve not seen in a while -- these seemingly mundane yet calming rituals must somehow counteract the fears, anxieties, guilts, etc. that produce sleepless nights.</p>

<p>Maybe time to lace up the sneaks and play a little hoop, Scott.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-149814607-content"><p>You might try this technique:</p>

<p>1. Find a reasonably well crafted reader-ID fantasy, of the type that you would have liked as a kid, but neither particularly YA nor of any real literary value.</p>

<p>2.  Re-read it.  Then re-read it again.</p>

<p>3.  Keep it by your bed.  When you can&#39;t sleep, pick it up and start to re-read it.  Drowsiness should occur within minutes, if not before you actually get the energy to open it.</p>

<p>4.  You can sometimes change which book it is, but only when you have time to re-read it once during the day.</p>

<p>If that doesn&#39;t work for you, there&#39;s always massive amounts of sleeping pills.</p></span>

<p>Ahistoricality, SHUT UP!</p>

<p>AWB, I wager you rarely sleep the night before you teach too?  I typically don&#39;t---hence all the over-elaborate lesson plans.  (I usually write them up after-the-fact.  I&#39;m always afraid I&#39;ll do something effective one quarter and just forget it, absolutely, by the next.)  I&#39;ve tried the game-playing, but I get too involved and want to take notes.  &quot;If I do X, I&#39;ll be able to anticipate Y next time <em>because I&#39;m an idiot who doesn&#39;t want sleep apparently</em>.</p>

<p>Rich, I really like that idea---much more than Mike&#39;s suggestion that I get healthy and exercise (I walk three miles every day!  That&#39;s exercise!)  (Sort of!)---and will try that out.  I have a stack of Bester I haven&#39;t read since my voice dropped.</p>

<p>Sisyphus, if I take two purring cats on put them on the bed, they&#39;ll curl into a ball for a few hours, then start bathing each other, then <b>IT&#39;S PLAYTIME BROTHER COME ON LET&#39;S WRESTLE!</b>  (Not that I can avoid this situation, mind you.)</p></span>

<p>Ahistoricality, I have a CD titled &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot; that I slip in sometimes.  Almost makes me think I&#39;m still in a place with weather, so it sometimes does the trick.  </p>

<p>read, if I did the north-south thing, first light would stream in my window every morning.  (Combination of windows and married-side-of-the-bed orientation.)  I&#39;ve tried cutting back on caffeine---I don&#39;t drink a lick after 2 p.m., but it&#39;s not the caffeine that keeps me up.  I can be tired and stupid unto death and still not be able to sleep because I&#39;m mulling over the relative merits of different puddings.  It&#39;s a curse, I tell you.</p></span>

<p>I wonder whether they picked out a specially boring philosophy lecturer?  Perhaps, this being Japan, they have competitions.  The winner does that reserved-yet-proud thing and gets their lecture preserved in order to bore to sleep generations to come.</p>

<p>Scott, it&#39;s important that the book you choose be one that isn&#39;t quite actively annoying -- it should be something that, on balance, you&#39;d enjoy reading in a sort of mindless way -- but it shouldn&#39;t be anything that you could actually, for instance, write a post about.  What you&#39;re going for is vaguely pleasant boredom, where the words have become so familiar that you find yourself dropping off rather than having to read them again.</p></span>

But because I do talk and write too much: By all means, let them use their own rope. (On Big Hollywood's sexist and homophobic Oscar live-blogging.)

Odd that Foxnews deleted so many of the links in that post there. Wonder why they did that?)</span></a></div>

The prototypical leadoff hitter should radiate self-importance. He has one job and one job only: to get on base. He has one style and one style only: ostentatious scrappiness. Leading off the for modernists is Ernest &quot;Papa&quot; Hemingway. If our shortstop must be a Derek Jeter clone, I can think of no one better than Joseph &quot;The Con&quot; Conrad: criminally overrated and not nearly so versatile as his ardent supporters insists. His once merely poor range has so deteriorated people point to where he is and exclaim: &quot;There he will be!&quot; But if you need someone selfish to ground selflessly out to second, &quot;The Con&quot; will move the runner along. Slot him in the #2 spot. Ignoring the sage advice offered by The Book because it is only written in one language, our three-hole will be manned by the greatest hitter world literature has ever known. This transplanted Irishman mashes from all sides of the plate. One minute he counsels. The next he does this. He is the only player to hit for the cycle in seventeen languages. Batting third and playing every position on the field (but mainly first): James &quot;Stephen Hero&quot; Joyce. Batting fourth and patrolling left field to the pounding pulsation of his own alliterative drum is our other once-in-a-generation genius: Ezra Being Ezra! (He''ll bat cleanup until it suits him otherwise then be traded to another nation.) In the fifth slot is our &quot;Three True Outcomes&quot; specialist. With him it's either French, English or Nonsense. Remember this name because he will go on manning the hot corner for years to come: Samuel &quot;Come In&quot; Beckett! Occupying our &quot;second leadoff spot&quot; and platooning at second are F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. (Whichever one is upright come gametime gets the start.) Their range may be limited but they turn a mean double play. Virginia Woolf roams center field and bats seventh. She covers more ground in a sentence than Willie Mays did in a day and makes it look so easy. Framing pitches behind the plate is the incomparably erudite H.D. She frames the plate so convincingly a generation of umpires have deferred to her strike zone. Like most cerebral catchers, her own output suffers from a severe case of &quot;analysis paralysis.&quot; Our ace on the mound is mercurial southpaw T.S. Eliot. Inscrutable but somehow effective, Eliot averages six brilliant innings before converting to Church of England and lulling teammates and opposition alike into a death-like sleep. In sum: Hemingway, rf Conrad, ss Joyce, 1b Pound, lf Beckett, 3b The Fitzgeralds, 2b Woolf, cf H.D., c Eliot, p</span></a></div>
