		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0128774817a3970c-content"><p>I recall being instructed as a kid by well-meaning teachers that you might want to use commas where you&#39;d pause when speaking; my assumption has been that a nation of children ingested this advice and therefore deploys commas whenever they think an asthamtic might pause for breath during the spring pollen onslaught.</p>

<p>re: the other thing, like many Americans I only really learned about grammar (in the formal, I can articulate what I&#39;m talking about and parse sentences on a chalk board) through the study of foreign languages, but I can&#39;t imagine learning about writing in an academic fashion.  I learned to write by osmosis, and presume the reason why I&#39;m a better writer than people who are worse writers than I am is because the odds are that I&#39;ve read many, many, many more books than they have, and a great many of those before I was sixteen.  Style is another thing, more elusive, but the trick of writing understandable sentences in something like formalized American English strikes me as a test of fluency with the written word.</p></span>

<p>(And sure, sure, I know there aren&#39;t hard and fast rules to comma usage. But at least when commas are used consistently, in a rule-based manner, I find fewer grammatical errors.  For example, I teach students to use a comma after any opening phrase.  It&#39;s not always necessary,  but it never really hurts: &quot;In the beginning, God made the monkeys&quot; or &quot;After lunch, we headed down to the morgue.&quot;)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01287749347c970c-content"><p>A rhetoric instructor I had once remarked that one of the many weird ways in which William Buckley and Gore Vidal were inextricably linked was that both men had somehow gone through their entire career as public patrician intellectuals without having any real idea how to properly use a comma.  You should mention to your students, perhaps, that if they happen to be scions of great family fortunes then the use of commas becomes less important.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m pretty sure most kids today still recognize Shatner qua Shatner.  Between the kitsch value of Star Trek and the cheese value of Boston Legal, plus his campy cover of Common People that I think still gets play on college radio, he pretty much has his bases covered.</p></span>

<p><em>through the study of foreign languages, but I can&#39;t imagine learning about writing in an academic fashion.</em></p>

<p>Many of my best writers are ESL for exactly this reason: there&#39;s none of that pride to convince them because they know the language, they know how to write in it.  Disabusing native-speakers of that notion is one of the most difficult tasks I have.</p>

<p>LB:</p>

<p><em>There are only, like, six or so rules to comma usage. I cover them in the first three weeks of tenth grade English. </em></p>

<p>I teach the templates, too, but especially when they start nesting clauses and quoting sources that contain commas themselves, students lose their shit.  I think it&#39;s as much of a case of over-thinking it, so they hyper-correct by placing a comma anywhere one <em>might</em> be needed.  (Or, as Medrawt wrote, they read their work aloud like winded asthmatics.)</p>

<p>Ahistoricality:</p>

<p><em>I was told once, by a writing/rhetoric teacher, that the only things that reliably improve writing are doing more writing and doing more reading. </em></p>

<p>Wait, I told you that, didn&#39;t I?  Even if I didn&#39;t, it&#39;s true, and it&#39;s something I say all the time.  (It&#39;s also why I have them read so material and write so many blogs: even &quot;informal&quot; writing, when done in a formal, classroom setting has a positive effect on their prose.  </p>

<p>Lawrence:</p>

<p><em>My composition classes are at least 50% comma-larnin&#39;. </em></p>

<p>My office hours tend to be about 90 percent.  I find the sentence-level material easier to handle in a one-on-one setting.</p>

<p>CP:</p>

<p>Buckley, yes, but I don&#39;t remember Vidal as being bad with commas.  Granted, I haven&#39;t read him since a high school fling with historical fiction, but I was more of a prescriptivist then than I am now, and am surprised I didn&#39;t notice.</p>

<p>Paul:</p>

<p>What is this &quot;BBS&quot; of which you speak, Paul?  Actually, I never played Pyroto Mountain, but a trivia game that eventually gives you magic powers?  That sounds like something I could&#39;ve gotten behind.</p></span>

<p>&quot;And now what does a comma do and what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about them.<br />
What does a comma do.<br />
I have refused them so often and left the out so much and did<br />
without them so continually that I have come finally to be indifferent<br />
to them. I do not now care whether you put them in or not but for a<br />
long time I felt very definitely about them and would have nothing to<br />
do with them.<br />
As I say commas are servile and they have no life of their own, and<br />
their use is not a use, it is a way of replacing one’s own interest and I<br />
do decidedly like to like my own interest my own interest in what I am<br />
doing. A comma by helping you along holding your coat for you and<br />
putting on your shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as<br />
you should lead it and to me for many years and I still do feel that way<br />
about it only now I do not pay as much attention to them, the use of<br />
them was positively degrading.&quot;</p></span>

<p>I&#39;m totally on board with this. It&#39;s pretty much the only way that I learned and actually remembered anything about commas/grammar. </p>

<p>There&#39;s one problem with it though, and that is when you are an editor, and someone wants to challenge and edit and they remember their all sorts of terms from classes they took. They start throwing the terms at you and you just want to start crying and yelling &quot;I&#39;ve read so much more than you! I know I&#39;m right!&quot; Instead, you explain to them how without a comma it means this, and with a comma it means that. Then they throw more terms at you, you admit that they are right, but the second they leave you change the damned comma anyways.<br />

Ann Althouse!It seems to me that the President is the victim of his own ideas about how to do things differently. If he had graciously accepted the inheritance left by George Bush, he wouldn't have had either of these problems. He squandered an inheritance that he failed to value! Bush—despite his reputation for simplicity—did understand the complexity of the problem, and he had a solution. There was stability. After posturing about &quot;change&quot; in his political campaign, Barack Obama seemed to think that he could apply the immense power he had won to changing things in the real world.Shorter? The President suffers from the delusion that he wants to do things differently. If he had just wanted to continue doing what Bush had done, he wouldn't have wanted to do things differently. Bush understood that stuff is hard, and he solved different hard stuff the same way every time. Obama said he wanted to solve different hard stuff differently during the election, and once he won it, he suckered himself into believing that he could wield the power he won to solve hard stuff his own way.Second-order shorter: It seems to me that Ann Althouse often writes about ideas she does not have. If she had ideas, she would write about them instead of the having of them, but because she only writes about the having of them, no one ever knows what they are. Her posts are like pictures of laptops idling on tables at which no one works: ideas could potentially be communicated through them, but for now they deliver no actual content, only the low hum of pointlessly cycling hard drives. Warning: Because her name has appeared three times in this post, she will, of course, show up in the comments and claim that her vacuousness is actually a vortex into which someone has been sucked. (Someone should alert her to the definition of &quot;vacuum&quot; that doesn't involve suction.)</span></a></div>

If you’re in Knoxville, you should check him out. Interestingly, it was the first time we’ve actually met. What, exactly, is interesting about the fact that this lunch happened? Is it that it's the first time these two water-carriers for conservative excess ever carried water in the same room at the same time? What's interesting about two people who live thousands of miles apart never having dined together? As a rule, nothing that can be true of any one person and any of the millions of people who live nowhere near him or her qualifies as interesting. You want interesting? I once punched Spencer Ackerman in the gut as hard as I could. Such acts of gratuitous blogger-on-blogger violence are inherently interesting. But lunch? Does Reynolds assume that his readers think all like-minded internet ideologues regularly assemble around some second-rate Algonquin Round Table, so that each might praise the other for having reached the same tendentious conclusion? (The pair do possess two of Dorothy Parker's three requirements in a man: &quot;He must be handsome, ruthless and stupid.&quot;) Don't let the uniformity of their independently conceived opinions fool you: they receive the same talking points and are intellectually lazy in the same way. They don't need to collaborate to draw identically idiotic conclusions. Perhaps the fact that they dined together is supposed to be interesting, what with the Singularity being so near and all that most people assume Reynolds no longer needs to feed his meat in order to &quot;Huh,&quot; &quot;Indeed&quot; and &quot;UPDATE.&quot; (If they had any sense, his readers would assume he's long since transferred responsibility for posting on Instapundit to a tourettic algorithm that trawls the internet for perfunctory contrarianism, second-rate science fiction novels and pictures of cars. Do you know how easy it is to post like Glenn Reynolds? I do. I made a whole day of it. It was not a good day.) Maybe the niceness of the lunch is what made it interesting? Lunch with Reynolds or Goldberg would not be &quot;nice&quot; if I had to attend it—my Southern sense of politeness would render me mute—but those two likely yukked it up about who'd be first against the wall when they're made king. I'm at a loss. I have no idea what could possibly have been interesting about the fact that these sad little men shared a table and a meal.</span></a></div>
