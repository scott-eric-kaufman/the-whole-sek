<p>Years ago, back when I wanted to be funny, I<a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/letters/letters35.html" rel="nofollow">wrote</a>: &quot;I had a student once named &quot;Tom Looms.&quot; I said, &quot;Your name, it&#39;s a complete sentence.&quot; He wasn&#39;t amused. Nor did he, as expected, loom, neither as a weaving artisan nor as a sinister lurking presence.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/letters/letters36.html" rel="nofollow">Soon After</a>, one Tim Durkin wrote:</p>

<p><i>Dear McSweeney&#39;s and Karl Steel,</i></p>

<p><i>My favorite name-that-is-also-a-complete-sentence belongs to the author of _The Screwtape Letters_ and the Narnia series:</i></p>

<p><i>Clive Staples Lewis. </i></p>

<p>Hard to top that one.</p></span>

That has to be worth something where the symbolic order is concerned.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-60152928-content"><p>When I was younger my mother bought me one of those cards that tell you what your name means. It said that Anthony meant priceless, which always gave me warm fuzzies. When I got older and realized that I could apply the little knowledge of language I had to boring things like my name I thought, &quot;Hmm... well the prefix &#39;an&#39; is a negation in Latin so &#39;thony&#39; or some variation of it must mean price.&quot; This lead me on a search to see if I was correct and, like Oedipus before me, the search for knowledge was devastating. It began with my finding that the Latin for price was nothing like &#39;thony&#39; and ended with my uncovering that Anthony has no known meaning and thus, since meaning must be known to be meaningful, my name meant nothing. My last name, Smith, is the generic name for a labourer and so I am a meaningless labourer; one of the unwashed masses. No solace in my middle name either, Paul, as it means &#39;small&#39; or &#39;humble&#39;. Even though using all three of my names appears somewhat boastful, they are three names that name, essentially, an almost nothing.</p></span>

Everyone was shocked when I got married, took my husband&#39;s last name and deleted all my middle names. &quot;how...submissive of you...&quot; said my university professor when he heard.....I said..maybe...but it saves time filling in transatlantic passenger disembarkation forms....</p>

CRITIC!</strong> For $500 and the game, name the author of the following quotations: Representative of the Mode Any slightly more than casual reader of literary journals knows either repertoire, and probably yawns at them both—as much as he is also bored by any eclecticist who tries to use all the factional vocabularies to make a transcendental synthesis. But, in the manner of an impressionistic historian, one can say there are things about what goes on in contemporary criticism today that are typical, even representative of the mode... From &quot;Fugitive Essays&quot; to Aletheia in Three Simple Steps If these anthologies serve any real function—aside from being convenient ways for the reader to get hold of fugitive essays—it is to let one think that they make up a consensus for today's critic, an immediate background he presumes to be accurate, from which he launches his own work, to which he responds, against which he defines himself, his allies, or his opponents. In accepting such a background the critic also presumes a background for the background, and without being too dodgy, he would say that these anthologies and what they represent aim to be different from previous anthologies and consensuses, which in turn were different from previous ones... &quot;Challenges&quot; of the Lesser Critic Most great critics are methodical; this perhaps only means that they are able to articulate and rationalize their intuitive awareness of literature. But it also means that they are not afraid of making their methods and their own writing independently interesting and intellectually consistent, over and above a work. For the lesser critic such challenges are rare. He will use the work in order to make it work, which it always will. His method will demonstrate its effectiveness, which it will always possess. And on and on, without any sense of the drama underlying method, or of its fundamental ground in intellectual life... The Will-to-Eccentricity Some of these dimensions appear perforce eccentric, even determinedly so. But this will-to-eccentricity, I think, is a major project of contemporary critical discourse...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/02/great_moments_i.html"><span><strong>Great Moments in Blogging History</strong> From Molloy's classic post, &quot;Now I Begin to Suck&quot;: I took advantage of being at the seaside to lay in a store of sucking-stones. They were pebbles but I call them stones. Yes, on this occasion I laid in a considerable store. I distributed them equally between my four pockets, and sucked them turn and turn about. This raised a problem which I first solved in the following way. I had say sixteen stones, four in each of my four pockets these being the two pockets of my trousers and the two pockets of my greatcoat. Taking a stone from the right pocket of my greatcoat, and putting it in my mouth, I replaced it in the right pocket of my greatcoat by a stone from the right pocket of my trousers, which I replaced by a stone from the left pocket of my trousers, which I replaced by a stone from the left pocket of my greatcoat, which I replaced by the stone which was in my mouth, as soon as I had finished sucking it. Thus there were still four stones in each of my four pockets, but not quite the same stones. And when the desire to suck took hold of me again, I drew again on the right pocket of my greatcoat, certain of not taking the same stone as the last time. And while I sucked it I rearranged the other stones in the way I have just described. And so on. But this solution did not satisfy me fully. For it did not escape me that, by an extraordinary hazard, the four stones circulating thus might always be the same four. In which case, far from sucking the sixteen stones turn and turn about, I was really only sucking four, always the same, turn and turn about. But I shuffled them well in my pockets, before I began to suck, and again, while I sucked, before transferring them, in the hope of obtaining a more general circulation of the stones from pocket to pocket. But this was only a makeshift that could not long content a man like me. But not to go over the heartbreaking stages through which I passed before I came to it, here it is, in all its hideousness. All (all!) that was necessary was to put for example, to begin with, six stones in the right pocket of my greatcoat, or supply-pocket, five in the right pocket of my trousers, and five in the left pocket of my trousers, that makes the lot, twice five ten plus six sixteen, and none, for none remained, in the left pocket of my greatcoat, which for the time being remained empty, empty of stones that is, for its usual contents remained, as well as occasional objects. For where do you think I hid my vegetable knife, my silver, my horn and the other things that I have not yet named, perhaps shall never name. Good. Now I can begin to suck. Watch...</span></a></div>
