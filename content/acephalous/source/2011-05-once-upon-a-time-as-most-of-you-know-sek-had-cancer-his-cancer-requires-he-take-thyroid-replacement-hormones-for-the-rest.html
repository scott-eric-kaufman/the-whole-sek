        <meta name="description" content="Once upon a time, as most of you know, SEK had cancer. His cancer requires he take thyroid replacement hormones for the rest of his life, but this January his Primary Care Physician informed him that he could not, in good conscience, continue to prescribe said hormones unless SEK saw an endocrinologist at least once a year, so he referred SEK to one who works at the UCI Medical Center. Because the United States has the best health care system in the world, three months later he arrives at the UCI Medical Center for his appointment. SEK: I am here for the appointment I have been waiting three months to have the pleasure of attending. NURSE: Do you have a referral? SEK: My doctor referred me, otherwise I would not have the appointment which I waited three months to have the pleasure of attending. NURSE: Let me call your Primary Care Physician. (dials phone, provides my name and information, listens) They have no record of a referral. SEK: Then why am I here? NURSE: (shrugs) SEK: Why did I receive an email reminding me to be here today at this time? NURSE: (shrugs) We can always restart the process— SEK: And I can wait another three months to be told there's no record of my referral? NURSE: Or you can see the doctor (which was becoming a pressing necessity, as SEK was experiencing some of the same symptoms that led to the diagnosis of cancer in the first place—most notably, an uncontrollable urge to nap) and pay out of pocket, straighten things out with your insurance company and be reimbursed. SEK: Fine, fine, this is why the Good Lord invented credit cards. SEK sees the endocrinologist, who is really quite extraordinary, has a few tests runs and leaves the office to get three gallons of blood work drawn at the lab. SEK: I have this long sheet of paper covered in X marks and this pad of stickers. Please steal my blood. LAB ATTENDANT: Gladly! The LAB ATTENDANT rolls up SEK's sleeves and withdraws three gallons of blood from SEK's arms.

<p>I would guess that you&#39;re going to get reimbursed approximately never.  My advice: you&#39;ve said before that you know a friendly lawyer.  Get them on the case now.  Have them write a friendly letter to the doctor&#39;s office starting the wheels turning and asking how they got a potentially mentally deficited patient to shell out $1,800+ for some blood tests.</p>

<p>What I do when this kind of thing happens -- when not mentally deficited, if that&#39;s a phrase -- is to go back and ask to talk to the office person who does the billing.  There is always some alternate way they can fill out the forms in order to make it work with the insurance company.  I have never, ever encountered a doctor&#39;s office without such a person, because if they don&#39;t have one, they don&#39;t survive.</p></span>

He got a referral from him his PCP to a dermatologist so he could get a biopsy for a suspicious looking skin lesion.  Since dermatologists these days are so busy doing botox injections and other cosmetic (i.e. highly profitable) procedures, he had to wait months for the appointment.  Then, when he shows up for it, not only do they not have a record of the referral, they neglected to tell him that the physician had died weeks earlier.  So, back to the PCP to get another referral, wait another several months, and then finally see a live dermatologist who confirms that it&#39;s (fortunately) only precancerous.  Good thing it wasn&#39;t malignant.</p></span>

It is very simple to do this because MDs work with each other here and also know there is a limited supply of blood to take.<br />
The other issue that is addressing this issue - I told you to find the Office Manager because that is the person really running the office.  What I suggest now is tell your credit card people to NOT pay these people unless they have corrected the mistakes they have made.  That way you will not be out of money and the mistakes will be corrected quicker.<br />
And now I will say they can&#39;t put the blood back because it is no longer &quot;clean&quot;. They add stuff to the blood depending on what tests are run.  If I could I would take back blood they don&#39;t use - my supply is limited and I have trouble making &quot;new&quot; cells. </p></span>

<p><em>You paid $1,800 plus the cost for the appointment?</em></p>

<p>It was $800 for the appointment would&#39;ve been $1,000 for the tests, had I not slunk away.</p>

<p><em>What I do when this kind of thing happens -- when not mentally deficited, if that&#39;s a phrase -- is to go back and ask to talk to the office person who does the billing. There is always some alternate way they can fill out the forms in order to make it work with the insurance company. </em></p>

<p>I have now talked to everyone, on all ends, multiple times, and the end result is that they won&#39;t approve a retroactive referral, even though I shouldn&#39;t have even been to schedule the appointment in the first place without a referral.  So the referral that doesn&#39;t <em>now</em> exist, but which <em>did</em> exist long enough for the original appointment to have been made, is still an issue, but not so much of one that they won&#39;t write me a referral to see an endocrinologist in Riverside, which would&#39;ve been nice in the first place, what with it being much closer to home.  So what&#39;s not an issue is whether I need <em>to see</em> an endocrinologist -- everyone agrees to that -- but whether my needing to see one last December was done through the channels in which I wading now which, I remind you, are the same ones I spent no small amount of time in last December.</p>

<p>On some planet, that makes perfect sense; on this one, it&#39;s bone- and soul-crushing tedium.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0154323a0e7f970c-content"><p>Sorry to read of your difficulty with doctors &amp; referrals. I wanted to write for two reasons:<br />
1) I too am a thyroid cancer survivor (since 1995) and am on thyroid hormone for life (total thyroidectomy);<br />
2) This part jumped out at me&quot;..but this January his Primary Care Physician informed him that he could not, in good conscience, continue to prescribe said hormones unless SEK saw an endocrinologist at least once a year&quot; - my first reaction was &quot;Get a different PCP&quot;.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m lucky, although I&#39;ve had 3 PCPs since the diagnosis, all of them have not had any problem monitoring my care, including yearly blood tests and continued prescription writing. I saw an endocrinologist at the 5- and 10-year &quot;anniversaries&quot;, plus one additional time when the tests weren&#39;t making sense - turns out the lab was having difficulty with the tests.</p>

<p>So, while I certainly sympathize with the losing of the referral (I only recently got back on an HMO plan vs. a PPO, and dread dealing with referrals), I guess I&#39;m questioning the &quot;need&quot; to see an endocrinologist. I obviously don&#39;t know the details of your situation, and am not a doctor, but I have been very much an active participant in my post-cancer care for 16 years.</p>

<p>Anyway, just wanted to provide my 2 cents. I hope you get it all sorted out, and good luck with the post-cancer care.</p></span>

<p>I&#39;m on seven years remission, and last saw an endocrinologist five years ago, so I don&#39;t think my doctor was out of order.  His staff, and the people who handle his paperwork?  Another story entirely. </p>

<p>(Also, imagine you and I fist-bumping.  I didn&#39;t have a complete, not nearly, removal of my thyroid, but I can only imagine.

<p>Funny thing is, when I was trapped by that volcano in your neck of the woods, it was &quot;six pounds,&quot; &quot;six pounds,&quot; &quot;six pounds,&quot; for scheduling, appointment, and prescription respectively.

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/04/when-faculty-attack.html"><span><strong>When Faculty Attack!</strong> A conservative sent me a passive-aggressive email concerning University of Iowa professor Ellen Lewin’s intemperate response to a passive-aggressive email the College Republicans sent about “Conservative Coming Out Week.” Instead of completing the Circle of Irony by responding to that conservative in an equally intemperate fashion, I would like to spend a moment pointing out the obvious: The professor’s response (“FUCK YOU, REPUBLICANS”) is clearly inappropriate, but in her defense, the College Republicans were just as clearly trying to be “provocative” by appropriating the language of the causes they oppose. They claim, for example, that they can host something called “Conservative Coming Out Week” without ever stopping to think about who exactly kept homosexuals afraid to exit the closet. Thin as liberal support for gay and lesbian causes frequently is, it is safe to say that the people who currently wish “those people” were back in the closet weren’t the most ardent supporters of them exiting it. Similarly, I’m sure the College Republicans chuckled to themselves when they first saw the phrase “Animal Rights BBQ” because they’ll be asserting their rights to barbeque animal … while simultaneously demonstrating their commitment to punning ungrammatically. I should add: that latter commitment extends to all matters ungrammatical, as evidenced by their decision to host the discussion “Whose Conservative Anyway? Guess which athletes, movie stars, and performing artists are Republican.” This is not to say that Dr. Lewin’s response was appropriate, even if In 2010, Lewin’s salary from the University of Iowa was $94,800.00 plus benefits. In her spare time, [she] was written books entitled, Inventing Lesbian Cultures in America, and Gay Fatherhood: Narratives of Family and Citizenship in America. My annoyance at the grammar of these proponents of English as an official language aside, the strange juxtaposition of Dr. Lewin’s salary and what she does “[i]n her spare” times speaks to the fundamental misunderstanding about what academics do and what their responsibilities are that snakes through the article and the comments below it. Professors don’t write books in their “spare time” because they have no spare time. Academics devote what these conservatives are calling “spare time” to professional duties these same conservatives would call “was written books.” Obviously, the implicit claim is that this professor on the public dole has enough “spare time” to “was written books” about gays and lesbians instead of how awesome George Washington was, because as Dr. Lewin herself pointedly noted, this is all about conservatives’ tactically “delicate sensibilities.” Were the College Republicans actually offended that a professor responded to their offensive provocation in a manner that demonstrated she was provoked by their offense? Absolutely not. As their faculty advisor (and fellow devotee to writing English good) wrote: It’s not my place at this point to debate the merits of whether the CR message was offense, but let me remind you that they have First Amendment rights as much as you do[.] The point can’t be the merit of a conservative student organization openly mocking homosexuals and animal rights...</span></a></div>
