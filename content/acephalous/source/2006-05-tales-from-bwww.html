<p>I read very little of the post the reference number indicates.</p>

<p>Let ME take control of this situation as is more apropriate, me being better et all.</p>

<p>War for access to modemland.</p>

<p>Dr.Luv's suggestion of MA is perfect.</p>

<p>Five other [judges of the war]?&nbsp; Bishop, he can appreciate it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Loki would be considered biased, Tenedos is fine.&nbsp; That makes three.&nbsp; &lt;just to help you keep up&gt; Laz doesn't like me, and I don't know enough about him to tell wether that would effect his judement of not.&nbsp; Danmietster is a stranger.&nbsp; No strangers.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>Two more...hmm...Reverend Beverage.&nbsp; &nbsp;Jack Flash.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Simple.&nbsp; &nbsp;Are you getting this?&nbsp; If these people are willing to put up with this idiocy for the two days it will take for the decisive victory to occur than it is fine.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I give you one chance to backoff before I make you miserable.&nbsp; Think about it.</p>

<p>And when you finally come to and soil your shorts in fear, only then will you realize the breadth of my superiority.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And who needs a fucking topic [as opposed to a pure, unadulterated Festival of Insult] anyway?&nbsp; Whatever you are blabbering about is unimportant.&nbsp; I want to war you, not debate you. Get it?&nbsp; Think before you even reach for the R[eply] key.&nbsp; Turn off your mouth and turn on your brain.&nbsp; If you value anything at all in your life &lt;which can't be much out of modemland&gt; than you will back down, apologize, and then you will be able to sleep at night.</p>

<p>You are on the vurge of making the mistake that could utterly ruin you.<br />I WAS going to just play around with you and SR etc...but you obviously leave me no choice.</p>

<p>DO YOU WANT TO DIE?&nbsp; When the appointed judges &lt;most of whom don't like me anyway, so I'm starting you off with a handicap&gt; arrive and announce it official you will be nervous, queasy, and you mind will be fogged over and cloudy, not necessarily from lack of confidence, but merely the stakes involved.&nbsp; You will not be able to think straight and you will be struck will fear.&nbsp; This is not because of me at all.&nbsp; simply because you have no experiance in warring for real stakes.&nbsp; You think warring for this board will give you the experiance, and it's only ONE board so why not, eh?&nbsp; Uh-uh, 'fraid not.&nbsp; I won't give you the oportunity.&nbsp; This is MY area and we will abide by MY settings.&nbsp; Or it will not happen.&nbsp; The judges I listed.&nbsp; The stakes I listed.&nbsp; No argument, no deal.&nbsp; And if you don't accept, than shut the fuck up.&nbsp; I'm tired of feable little threats by the likes of you and your associates that are no realizable.&nbsp; Welcome to where it all matters, and where it all is lost.&nbsp; Don't plan on winning.&nbsp; And when you lose, don't plan on ever looking at anything the same again.&nbsp; This isn't just A war, and I am not just A person.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I determine psycological effects on you for years to come.&nbsp; That is that power granted to me.&nbsp; The power to not only blacklist you with one war, but to ensure that you slink and slither through life the way you slithered through modemland to this point.&nbsp; I will cripple your mind.&nbsp; I will then crush you.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It is that simple, but in is simplexity is a complex maze of terror for you.&nbsp; The knowlege that you cannot again back out if you accept, and once lost, you will never have the chance to redeem yourself.&nbsp; No one care about you.&nbsp; No one will greive your loss.&nbsp; Your freinds will quietly think sad thoughts but none are willing to try to avenge you.&nbsp; Not because they do not care, as I do not care, but merely because they will see what became of you as what WILL become of them if they try.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This is the identity of your hell, I hope it is as warm and pleasent for you as it is for me.</p>

<p><em>Z&gt; And who needs a fucking topic anyway? </em></p>

<p>Afraid that if this is anything more than a mud slinging contest you can't<br />hold your own?</p>

<p><em>Z&gt; I want to war you, not debate you.&nbsp; Get it?</em></p>

<p>Afraid that if this is anything more than a mud slinging contest you can't<br />hold your own?</p>

<p>Funny the way the topic always seems to be avoided with you.</p>

<p><em>Z&gt; If you value anything at all in your life, which can't be much out of modemland...</em></p>

<p>Strange, I didn't think that anything outside the war sub affected anything going on inside the war sub.&nbsp; [Like Vegas!]&nbsp; C'est la vie.</p>

<p>And by the way, you're right.&nbsp; I don't have much of a life outside the boards.&nbsp; I have my four friends, and that's all I need.&nbsp; They're all dating other people, so I don't go out much.&nbsp; I read a lot.&nbsp; Shoot me.&nbsp; I go to shows, catch movies, and live a life of solitude that suits me.</p>

<p>In other words, stop throwing your insecurities onto me and stop thinking that I care.&nbsp; I don't have the need, and wouldn't have the need, to advertise what I am off of the boards on the boards.</p>

<p><em>Z&gt; You are on the vurge of making the mistake that could utterly ruin you.</em></p>

<p>I'm on the vErge of what?&nbsp; A mistake.&nbsp; You're taking this a little too seriously.&nbsp; There is absolutely nothing you could do to me, and I'll say it again, absolutely nothing you can do to me that hasn't already been done and that I haven't already weathered.&nbsp; So send me your best, I'm waiting, and willing.</p>

<p><em>Z&gt; DO YOU WANT TO DIE?</em></p>

<p>Not really.&nbsp; Then again, from someone who's life isn't the boards (as you have so lovingly informed us), where does the concept of death come into this.&nbsp; For death, there must be life, and since there is no life, there is no death, right?</p>

<p>Don't look at me, you said it.</p>

<p><em>Z&gt; I won't give you the oportunity.&nbsp; This is MY area and we will <br />Z&gt; abide by MY settings.&nbsp; Or it will not happen.&nbsp; The judges I listed. </em></p>

<p>You're going to be in for one hell of a mid life crisis with this insecurity you're parading around.&nbsp; A Corvette, a new wife (trade her in for a younger model, or wait, nevermind, someone with your convictions couldn't do that, now could they)...</p>

<p>I think Jung said it best by not saying a damn thing at all.&nbsp; [Young <em>and </em>already pretentious!]</p>

<p><em>Z&gt; I'm tired of feable little threats by the likes of you and you<br />Z&gt; associates that are no realizable. </em></p>

<p>Threats not being lived up to?&nbsp; I don't think I've made a threat yet that I've haven't stood behind.&nbsp; You, on the other hand, have a lot to live up to.&nbsp; The standards you're setting for yourself.</p>

<p>Anyways, back to the contest...</p>

<p>Why resort to this mentality?&nbsp; Why regress in such a fashion that would make us both look like fools.&nbsp; If that's the way you'd like to do it, fine, by all means go ahead, but as a great, if not a slightly off the ball general put it:</p>

<p>'War is a gentlemen's game.'</p>

<p>Patton something or other said that.&nbsp; Also said something about the people who think they can win with sheer brute force, but I don't think that pertains to anything here, does it?</p>

<p><em>Z&gt; Don't plan on winning.</em></p>

<p>Ploy to leave the opponent disenchanted, I can assume.&nbsp; Didn't work.</p>

<p><em>Z&gt; And when you lose, don't plan on ever looking at <br />Z&gt; anything the same again.&nbsp; </em></p>

<p>I'd like to know the exact ramifications that you, that's if you, defeat me will haunt me for years to come.</p>

<p>Funny how seriously people whose lives don't revolve around this particular genre of communication take things...</p>

<p><em>Z&gt; This isn't just A war, and I am not just A person.<br />Z&gt; I determine psycological effects on you for years to come. </em></p>

<p>Simply put, bullshit.</p>

<p>There are no long term effects, and you are just a person.</p>

<p>You are nothing more than a person, and everything less than a God.&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>Z&gt; The power to not only blacklist you with one war...</em></p>

<p>If you have the power to blacklist the CoSysOp on any board in town, I'd just love to know.&nbsp; It'd help.&nbsp; Or, did you not know that I'm the CoSysOp on many a board that I call?&nbsp; Or is it that you don't call many a board that I call?</p>

<p>Or wait, can you even blacklist me on the board that I run?&nbsp; Can you black list the SysOp?&nbsp; Can you stop the users from calling MY board?</p>

<p>Let me tell you, I'm impressed.&nbsp; Thoroughly.</p>

<p><em>Z&gt; I will cripple your mind. </em></p>

<p>According to you, it's too late.&nbsp; I'm for human rights, I read books, I listen to music, sorry, music that isn't the same three chords beaten in some random order, and I'm not a sheep.</p>

<p>You want your, you need your, you want your Mtv.</p>

<p>I AM Generation X.&nbsp; Indifferent, lost, and confused.&nbsp; I've found my own path, and have followed it and will follow it, till death do we part.</p>

<p>I will cripple your mind.&nbsp; Nice to meet you, just call me Mr. Bunny.</p>

<p><em>Z&gt; Not because they do not care, as I do not care, but merely because<br />Z&gt; they will see what became of you as what WILL become of them if <br />Z&gt; they try.&nbsp; </em></p>

<p>Well, you're more than welcome to war them too.</p>

<p>There's this concept that I don't think you quite grasp.&nbsp; Friends aren't numbers, and the more you have in no way relates to who's better off when who's gone.</p>

<p>There's something solid in solitude.&nbsp; Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.&nbsp; [Look how cute!&nbsp; He can quote Thoreau!]</p>

<p>You, you're calling out for help, and look, here I am.<br /><em><br />Z&gt; This is the identity of your hell, I hope it is as warm and pleasent for <br />Z&gt; you as it is for me.</em></p>

<p>There is no Hell where I come from.</p>

<p>Zazen is my peace.&nbsp; [Don't look at me.&nbsp; I haven't a clue what I'm talking about.]&nbsp; My Heaven is found in my self, simple as that.</p></blockquote><p>Pretentious?&nbsp; What do you expect of a 14 year old who thought Mark Helprin's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156001942/diesekoschmar-20">Winter's Tale</a> </em>the best book in the History of Everything?&nbsp; (And before anyone asks, I have no idea where that Jung reference came from.&nbsp; I'm sure I'd been ostentatiously reading him at Coffee Call to impress . . . someone or other.&nbsp; But names and dastardly clever ploys escape me.&nbsp; She surely mentioned Jung at some point and I certainly took the bait is all I'm saying.) </p>

<p>I have an entire unformatted archive of the rest of the exchange, but I have no doubt that it's as dull as the above to all those who weren't there and/or part of the scene.&nbsp; My point is simply that there is a pathetically masculine mode of interaction and that it ain't pretty.&nbsp; Fun?&nbsp; Certainly.&nbsp; But it's so painfully overcompensation for the snap of wet towels against unprotected thighs that it's not worth aspiring to.&nbsp; By which I mean, when I think of the gendered nature of the blogosphere, I don't want to claim that anyone can't participate in anything . . . only that no one should want to participate in such Contests of Redirected Insecurities <em>regardless of gender</em>.&nbsp; I've known women who'd have slaughtered all those who dared oppose her on a war board.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But why should she want to?&nbsp; I could probably still do the Bat Dance, but you don't see me doing it, do you?&nbsp; (Granted, that's only because I've drawn the blinds tight, but you see my point.)<br /> </p>

They, too, were on the war boards being pretentious, and they also claimed that Winter&#39;s Tale was the best book in the History of Everything.

Jim #2: Was he? I can't remember. I'd wet my goozle with some hard knockout drops soon as the sun dropped. Andy: (stumbling in) So I drank some corn juice, I remember that much . . . Sam: 'Pifflicated, you were! Andy: I was at that. I was seeing snakes for sure. What happened to Mary? All: Let's not talk about the after-date. Andy: Why not? She was strong for lovin' last I recall. (a confuzzled look crosses his face) I was . . . Sam #2: You're no big butter and egg man from out West anymore. Andy: What's your insinnuendo? I showed some mean stuff and now she just gives me air? Jim: You shouldn't have told her 'bout your surety. She thinks you a chicken duster now. Andy: I'm no . . . I suppose it's not worth discussing. I'm not sloptimist enough to think I can open her gate now. Jim #2: Plus Jim over there told her you were a chest-pounder. Andy: Why'd you go and do that? Drift, brother, and close the door behind you. (Jim leaves. Andy turns to the Sams) What happened last night? Which slicker brought panther-sweat to our private tunk? Sam: You did. Andy: I did? Sam #2: You came blustering in about not cookie-pushing for any more high higs and how you were coming to this and every future rub stag. Andy: She was a knock-out and a darb, but my father isn't paying this grill four thousand a year for me to be some rare lady's tea hound. I mean, she knows her oil . . . Jim #2: She is full of vinegar. Sam #2: And she never breaks a wing. Andy: But she gives a lot of house. Sam #2: That's not what I heard tell. Andy: Where's your muffler? Sam #2: Sorry. I can be such a sock. You want to join our cram tonight? Jim #2: You should. You're on the mat and Sam really knows his onions. Andy: I should. I don't want to get a letter from His Highness. Sam: You're next invite to the Dean's formal will be your last. Andy: (slumps) This Jewish engineering has me down on all fours. Don't get me wrong. The professor's pretty hot. When we chum he has the oil and keeps cramming. But I thought his would be a pipe and now it's all whip and over. Sam #2: Just be sure to bone and you won't get a footing. Jim: (runs in) C'mon, peaches, here's your can! (Jim #2, Sam, Sam #2 and Andy give chase. Homosocial hilarity ensues.)</span></a></div>
