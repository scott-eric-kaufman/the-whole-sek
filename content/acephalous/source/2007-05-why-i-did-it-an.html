			<p>Before writing up the post the <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/cue_blogwide_st.html#comment-69138994">victorious Mr. Kugelmass</a> requested, I thought I'd share the <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/cue_blogwide_st.html#comment-69044150">reasoning</a> behind this <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/cue_blogwide_st.html">little experiment</a> with those of you (slackers/ingrates/pedophiles) who stopped keeping track of the previous post/strike/hostage-taking:</p>

<p>As I sat down to compose <a rel="nofollow" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/04/colloquiam_on_b.html">my talk</a>,
I realized how much different things seem now than when I first started
blogging. As I've said before, originally the blog was an excuse for me
to vent at a world—before you ask, I took those posts down long ago—and
not just any world, but one so uncouth it decided I deserved cancer. I
was an angry boy. But it quickly turned into more than that, as I
started to write light pieces about mild annoyances which had the
salutary effect of making them disappear. (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/how_to_open_an_academic_essay/index.html">Example</a>.)&nbsp; Then I joined the Valve and started tackling major annoyances.&nbsp; (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/new_post_by_yt_.html">Example</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/academic_advoca.html">example</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/noneclectic_ecl.html">example</a>.)&nbsp; Despite being the high point of what Adam's called <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2007/05/tuesday-hatred-my-career-as-blogger.html">the Theory Wars</a>,
it was an incredibly productive time for me, intellectually speaking
... and despite his further claim that no one ever changes his or her
mind on the basis of a blog conversation, this is when I changed my
mind about Theory. Not about theory/Theory, mind you, but about my
relation to the body of thought which goes by that name. I didn't
return to the theory crazy days of my youth, but I started to
reenvision my notion of what the profession is and what theory's place
is in it. (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/psychoanalysis_.html">Example</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/on_the_power_of.html">example</a>.)&nbsp; </p>

<p>The growth may not have been as transparent as it felt, but I thought I'd pretty obviously turned a corner.&nbsp; Then came <a rel="nofollow" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/04/how_to_police_t.html">this</a>.
A ridiculously stupid debate with a certified idiot who could've cared
less about what I thought and lazily ascribed to me beliefs I didn't
hold, positions I found unsound, and then, to top it all off, he went
on a petty bender the likes of which I'd never before encountered. I
realized I had two choices: I could respond with a detailed account of
his pettiness and thereby look petty myself; or I could ignore it and
allow his misrepresentation of my claims to stand. We all know which
route I took. Thing is, I can't say for certain that if I had to do it
again, I'd do it any differently. </p>

<p>I realized, then, that I'd been backed into a corner.&nbsp; And not just any corner, no, but one which was profoundly unfun <em>and</em>
consumed time and attention I neither had nor wanted to expend. So I
decided to shut down the blog. Disappear from a scene whose grievances
had grown so tangled that I couldn't figure out what would set people
off—I mean, really, when a post which could've been titled &quot;Foucault Is
Supremely Nifty &amp; I Love Him&quot; becomes a flashpoint, the only
conclusion is that the system is broken. Shutting it down seemed the
only sane option. That same day, I met with my advisor and made him a
deal: I would have a draft of a chapter done once a month (starting in
June) from now until December and graduate in the Fall quarter. This
would allow me to teach in the UC system again in the Winter, which
means an income and, more importantly, health insurance. So the next
few months look like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>June 1st: London chapter.

</p>

<p>June 15th: Revised Mitchell chapter.</p>

<p>July 1st: Wharton chapter.</p>

<p>July 15th: Revised London chapter.</p>

<p>August 1st: James chapter.</p>

<p>August 15th: Revised Wharton chapter.</p>

<p>September 1st: Chapter Five.</p>



<p>September 15th: Revised James Chapter.</p>

<p>October 1st: Revised Introduction.</p></blockquote>

<p>The last few months I'll spend revising what I've done. This may
seem like an impossible task, but I've already done most of the
research for ... everything except the Wharton, which I'm working on
now. (The mystery fifth chapter will either be on Charlotte Perkins
Gilman or the American reception of <em>Middlemarch</em>.)&nbsp; I came home fully satisfied with the Hell I'd arranged for myself.&nbsp; All I needed to do was shut down the blog.</p>

<p>But I couldn't. Not because I'm unnaturally attached to it—even
though I am—but because I had spent the days previous remembering when
blogging was fun and, more importantly, intellectually productive.
(Plus, the event on <em>The Novel of Purpose</em> had just ended, and
it had been so successful that I couldn't write the genre off
entirely.) So I decided to do this instead. </p>

<p>I thought two things would happen: first, there was a real
possibility the thread would never reach 500 comments; second, that if
did, something about the dynamic would have to have changed. Lurkers
would have to pipe up and engage each other. Regulars would have to get
creative. People would have to have <em>fun</em> for it to even be in the ballpark.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I thought it akin to being on a spaceship and trapping half the crew
in a hanger deck. At first, they'd be confused; then they'd be
concerned; after a while, they'd start to try to entertain themselves
... and people who didn't know each other (or didn't know each other
well) would start to talk to each other. Old antagonisms would fall to
the wayside and everyone would interact on a level they hadn't before.
(The music mini-thread is a perfect example of this.) Then, of course,
the oxygen would run low and everyone would get a little giddy ... at
which point I'd return with a wrench and a laser and open the blast
doors manually. Everyone would disperse, but they'd remember the
experience they'd shared and think more fondly both of each other and
the ship that'd nearly killed them.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that'll be the case, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.</p>

(Deposit comments on this un-post here.) This is merely a reminder that, as the strike draws to a close, the 500th comment is still up for grabs. Remember, you can have me write about anything you so desire, so long as you're the 500th commenter. I'll post my criterion for inclusion in the final count when I announce the winner. In the meantime, Timothy suggests you post a link to the strike on some conservative blog. Because that would look like link-spamming, I won't endorse it ... however, if you want to write a little diatribe about how much you hate Jesus/Bush/Republicans/pants, post it in the comments then link to that.
