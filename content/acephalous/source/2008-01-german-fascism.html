		<span id="comment-98651422-content"><p>Goldberg is mapping all politics on a see-saw with state consolidation at one end and individual liberty at the other.  No spectrum, just fat-assed kids going up and down.  He then identifies freedom in the marketplace with individual liberty.  </p>

<p>Through this logic, a minimum wage law is a move against &quot;individual liberty&quot; (read: unfettered markets).  And so socialism, New Dealism, communism, and Nazism all weigh down the state-consolidation end of the see-saw, while American conservatism rises into the air.  Whee.</p>

<p>What Goldberg cannot seem to imagine is that a popularly elected government might be put in power to use its power to ensure true individual liberty and rights that are abused in a free market.  Old people might get to stop working.  Poor people might get some help.  Unemployed people might have a safety net.  Darker colored people might be freed from slavery or ensured the right to vote without intimidation.  People with vah-jay-jays might be paid the same as people with shlongs.  All of which policies protect individuals.</p>

<p>(Goldberg&#39;s other problem is that he cannot decide if his argument is about historical contingency or political philosophy.  Some lefties might have looked up to Hitler, but that doesn&#39;t mean that they weren&#39;t contradicting their political beliefs in doing so.  Environmentalism might have been a part of some Nazis worldview, but that doesn&#39;t mean  as a set of beliefs and practices it must be forever tainted by its historical roots.  I think this is called the genetic fallacy.) </p></span>

		<span id="comment-98694196-content"><p>Is there any way to address this without commenting on the waste of space-time that is Goldberg&#39;s book?  Perhaps.  Goldberg&#39;s book is part of the right-wing attempt to rehabilitate fascism.  Of course, as in the famous quote, when they rehabilitate it in America they&#39;ll call it anti-fascism.  The Republicans want torture, ultra-patriotism, endless war, anti-left-agitation, takeover by an unrestrained executive, racist nativism, etc., and this is just one little preemptive step to try to ensure that people can&#39;t use the accepted name for this political syndrome.</p>

<p>So far, so obvious.  But what would a serious (or, at least, more-serious) unexpected left intellectual American connection with fascism look like?  I&#39;ve been wondering about that ever since the to my mind completely unexplained left interest in Schmitt.  I read a little bit of Schmitt and see a completely boring fascist, not just boring, but simplistically boring -- the friend/enemy distinction as basis for state politics is one of those stupid ideas that a fascist would believe, and the kind of thing that helps to indicate why fascist politics always failed.</p>

<p>If you want a more serious provocation than Goldberg&#39;s drivel, try Chabert, <a href="http://lecolonelchabert.blogspot.com/2007/12/toilet-paper-or-writing-in-shit.html#2313988465792505702" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  I don&#39;t agree with all of it, but it&#39;s at least interesting.  There&#39;s something about the &quot;liberal hawk&quot; attraction to narratives of the clash of civilizations that it throws an interesting light on.<br />

<p>John, as soon as I get that Ph.D., I&#39;ll have documented proof that I&#39;m <em>much</em> better than The American People.  With it in hand, my campaign to undermine American Morality and Truth and Justice will begin in full.</p>

<p>Rich, this is a fine sentence, worthy of repetition:</p>

<blockquote>The Republicans want torture, ultra-patriotism, endless war, anti-left-agitation, takeover by an unrestrained executive, racist nativism, etc., and this is just one little preemptive step to try to ensure that people can&#39;t use the accepted name for this political syndrome.</blockquote>

<p>I may just copy and paste it the next time someone tries to convince me who the <em>real</em> fascists are.  As for Chabert&#39;s post, well, <em>TOO LONG</em>.  I trust it has a payoff.  The more interesting thing on that thread is the comment below <a href="http://lecolonelchabert.blogspot.com/2007/12/toilet-paper-or-writing-in-shit.html#1137312598095541678" rel="nofollow">this one</a>.  (You&#39;ll see why I linked to the one above it.)  Sample:</p>

<blockquote>I perceive a level of &quot;magic&quot; surrounding Osama Mobarack, a red flag and a clue.
The magic surrounding Osama is not going to be used to promote bi-racial, for this will represent the gods accepting culpability . His mere presence on this national stage is all that is necessary to justify telling uppity-negros to enter into bi-racial unions, ensuring people fall on their own swords.

<p>The gods offer a clue through his name.</blockquote></p>

<p>Indeed they do!  </p>

<p>Luther, I love the image, not merely because it demonstrates more vividly than I could the origins of Goldberg&#39;s nuance.  As for the genetic fallacy, notice how it only runs one way (in the negative, at least, as all positive Republican valences are played, <em>e.g.</em> &quot;Lincoln was a Republican&quot;)?  The <em>good</em> the Progressives did is credited to classical liberalism -- <em>i.e.</em> contemporary Republicans -- while the <em>bad</em> settles on contemporary liberals.  But there&#39;s no <em>bad</em> coming from historical Republicans, even back when they were Democrats, because, well, history only matters when it&#39;s your opponents.</p></span>

<p><i>Beer drinking goat castrated by jealous neighbor! Clay Henry III, beer drinking goat and mayor of the west Texas border town of Lajitas, was attacked by local Jim Bob Hargrove and castrated. Hargrove committed the heinous deed after seeing the goat drinking beer on a Sunday, when the area&#39;s blue laws prevent the sale of alcohol to humans. Tourists had apparently been feeding Clay Henry his usual staple of Lone Star longnecks, and Hargrove threatened to castrate the goat, according to eyewitnesses. The mayor was found lying next to his testicles on Monday, Aug. 5. Ranchers sutured his wounds, and Clay was up slugging down cold ones soon after. Hargrove faces charges of animal cruelty.</p>

		<span id="comment-98783220-content"><p>A thousand times no about that &quot;first rate review from <i>The American conservative</i>&quot;.  </p>

<p>This points out the particular problem with reviewing such a horrendously bad book.  Anyone, of any political position, can write a review slamming it, and people will look at that review and think something like &quot;wow, even someone of X political tendency doesn&#39;t like Goldberg&#39;s book.  Since I normally don&#39;t agree with who hold to X at all, this must be a particular thoughtful example of X thought.&quot;  But no.  It takes no particular brilliance to see what&#39;s wrong with Goldberg&#39;s book.  Anyone can do it.  Everyone will do it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like condemning the Bush administration.  Sure, you can find something from any and every political viewpoint condemning the Bush administration as of 2007, once it became so blindingly obvious how bad it was.  But so what?  By then it was blindingly obvious as opposed to merely obvious.</p>

<p>The American Conservative review in question in fact continues the very tropes that Goldberg tries to introduce.  For instance, this quote:</p>

<p>&quot;Other than scandalizing one’s enemies, little is accomplished by applying the categories “Right” and “Left” to Hitlerism.&quot;</p>

<p>Nope.  Fascism is right-wing and always has been.  If you can&#39;t say that fascism is right-wing, then you&#39;re saying that the categories &quot;Right&quot; and &quot;Left&quot; have no meaning.  But according to history, they do.  In particular, fascism and current American right-wing ideas are related as described by, say, David Niewert, and there is a possible developmental path from one to the other.</p>

<p>The American Conservative review tries to downplay the same connections between conservatism and fascism that Goldberg does.  The fact that the review is by a conservative and slams some of Goldberg&#39;s obvious stupidities does not make it good.<br />

<p>Karl, I don&#39;t know how much summing up of Chabert&#39;s story I really should do for her, but she&#39;s a leftist blogger who used to blog at Long Sunday, had a falling out with at least some other Long Sundayans over the way in which the ToS was handled, and now blogs from what I&#39;d characterize as a Marxist position that involves disagreement with at least some thinkers -- Zizek, at least, and those influenced by him -- on what&#39;s generally thought to be on the left.  As for her having a beef with everyone, I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s not like I keep track.  But she probably does with most people in this little corner of the blogosphere; she seems to generally dislike the main people in the Valve, LS, and the Weblog, anyway.</p>

<p>She&#39;s abrasive, and I first read her writing when she was baiting Sean M. over at the Valve in a particularly unfair and pointless way.  But she&#39;s a reliable source for criticisms from the left that are willing to confront the annoying doublespeak by which nothing can be wrong if it comes from one of the approved set of people.  I don&#39;t often agree with her, but I can at least understand what we don&#39;t agree about.</p></span>

<p>Jpool, &quot;Nazism was certainly a movement of the right, but that and shared bits and pieces aren&#39;t what makes contemporary conservatism crap&quot; is beside the point.  If you want a sophisticated argument about how movement conservatism serves as a sort of transmission belt to move proto-fascist ideas into the mainstream, try Niewert.  What about that review is actually good?  It says that Goldberg is wrong and intellectually vacuous, well, fine, any smart fourteen-year-old could say that.  But it goes on from this unchallenged base of obvious truth to imply that fascism is not on the Right and that Schmitt was a great thinker.  That&#39;s a classic propaganda technique: a) 2 + 2 = 4, b) now that you see what a truth-teller I am, 2 +3 = 6.<br />

<p><i>What about that review is actually good?</i><br />
The part that you think any smart fourteen year-old could do.  Frankly, you know smarter fourteen year-olds than I do, but the thing for me is not that it&#39;s a unique critique or that it&#39;s from a &quot;conservative&quot; perspective (more on those quotation marks below), but because the core of it, the critique of Goldberg is nicely reasoned and well written.  Any thinking person isn&#39;t lead from this to accept whatever other political presumptions the person making the critique is packing.<br />
<i>That&#39;s a classic propaganda technique</i><br />
I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s going on here.  It&#39;s a question of intention.  Just as, while Bush and Cheney&#39;s actions make a fascist state more likely, I don&#39;t think they are <i>trying</i> to usher one in, I don&#39;t think Bramwell&#39;s trying to use the sweet sweet candy of a critique of Goldberg to lure in unsuspecting readers.<br />
In support of your larger point about the dangers of decoupling Nazism from right-wing politics, however, as a Buchananite publication, the <i>American Conservative</i> has both a more contentious relationship to movement coservatism than its name might imply, and its own reasons for wanting to defang an association with Nazis.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-98855548-content"><p>I understand that the <i>American Conservative</i> has a contentious relationship with movement conservatism.  It is, however, still conservative.  As such it has its own inherent interest in denying the right-wing nature of fascism -- as you write, its own reasons to defang this connection.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m referring to.  It&#39;s not that the <i>American Conservative</i> is supposed to be working on a coordinated campaign with Goldberg, or something like that.  No, the review as written both criticizes Goldberg and, at the same time, attempts to cut the connections between the <i>American Conservative</i>&#39;s own racist nativism and the right-wing racism of fascism.  It&#39;s a twofer.  Someone else reading it should not give them a pass for the second on the basis of the first, because the first is relatively valueless.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think Bramwell&#39;s trying to use the sweet sweet candy of a critique of Goldberg to lure in unsuspecting readers.&quot;</p>

<p>Why?  I&#39;ve seen the critique linked in a number of places.  Just here, &quot;scrumptious&quot; recommended it highly, and you wrote that it&#39;s a pretty damn good review.  Are either of you habitual <i>American Conservative</i> readers?  I would guess not.  So why do you say that the review was not designed to do what it has obviously done -- gotten you to read something from the magazine, and left you with a better opinion of it in some degree?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the weird thing about people confronted with even a minimal propaganda analysis of a piece that they liked.  They&#39;ll deny that it did what it did.  Of course many people in the center-left blogosphere are looking for critiques of Goldberg; he&#39;s a purposefully provocative buffoon.  Of course they are likely to value one from a conservative more highly, just as people currently love to link to something John Cole writes because &quot;look, it&#39;s a conservative criticizing other conservatives&quot;.  Of course this process leaves people with a feeling that there are mythical conservatives somewhere who are all nice and rational, not like the bad, nasty movement conservatives.</p></span>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>That&#39;s an unfair assessment. I for one have made no such assertion.  </p>

<p>I thought it was a well-written, well-thought-out article that presented criticisms I hadn&#39;t seen articulated as well elsewhere.  Is it &quot;first rate&quot;?  Well, I admit to probably being a little hyperbolic, especially in light of some of the earlier points you made.  I&#39;ll acknowledge that &quot;interesting&quot; or &quot;thought-provoking,&quot; may be a better description.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t appreciate your attempts to misrepresent my views.</p></span>

You know, that&#39;s recommending it highly -- there&#39;s no misrepresentation there.</p>

The pharmacist calls the woman who can't stop chewing to the counter and the ELDERLY ASIAN-AMERICAN WOMAN and SEK are now first and second in line respectively. Up walks an ELDERLY JEWISH MAN.
