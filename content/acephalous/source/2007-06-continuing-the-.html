Althouse: Thanks for coming over here and showing what a fusty old fart you are. Why should I spend my time writing out arguments responding to you? Who are you? Not a good writer. Not someone with ideas that impress me. Why should I spend my time like that? Shouldn't a lawyer know better than to prove the validity of the point she countermands? Speaking of Kugelmass, he finished his second written exam today. Stop by his place and congratulate him on a job (no doubt) well-done.

Were I not tired of words and their meanings, I'd respond to this bit in particular: What I really want to do is ask the other panelists what their reaction was to the last dude, who was very energetic and funny, but in a rather cutting, mean way, tromping all over the utopian-access-to-the-public-sphere vibe of the other speakers (and he seemed to be trained as a speaker, whereas everyone else is renowned for their blogging, i.e. their writing style, which doesn't seem quite fair in a matchup. Why were they brought in live, instead of to blog things?). But if they were to respond to my questions about the final dude, on their blogs, how truthful would they be able to be? Wouldn't they feel an impulse to be polite, or at least strategic, in their responses about someone they had actually met in real life? It would go something like: &quot;I don't think Ari was being mean, but then again, when I hear the name 'Ari,' this man springs to mind.&quot; A more serious response later, when I'm capable of responding seriously." />

<p>Congrats on finishing your chapter! Everything I&#39;ve heard about your work on London makes me frankly jealous.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I had to add over at Althouse&#39;s place, after seeing (via your post) that she&#39;d responded:</p>

<p><i>In all seriousness, Ann, what is going on here? Now I&#39;m a &quot;fusty old fart&quot;? Go ahead, call me a doofus too, and a stupidhead. I&#39;m not too proud to shed tears. You&#39;re completely terrified of responding substantively to my post, and your image of yourself as some sort of host for &quot;America&#39;s Next Top Intellectual&quot; is a joke that just keeps getting funnier.</i></p></span>

<p>Ari didn&#39;t come across as mean.  He just seems genuinely unconvinced of blogging&#39;s potential to influence scholarship in a valuable way.<br />

<p>First of all, this is an obvious lie. She was clearly talking about reading literature critically in schools. Second, is she now saying that children shouldn&#39;t be taught to learn how to read? Is there no position too asinine for Althouse to take in the name of contrarianism?</p></span>

So I'll ask straightforwardly: The Troll of Sorrow approves of Althouse's plan to remove literature from the classroom. I'm at a loss. Who does this speak more poorly of, him or her?
