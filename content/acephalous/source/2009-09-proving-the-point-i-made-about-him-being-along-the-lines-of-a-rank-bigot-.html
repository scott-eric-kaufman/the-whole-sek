Somehow, he managed to keep it together long enough to hear what these “pretty young, not that big” black “kids” were saying, which he transcribed for the sensitive ears of his readers thusly: Without resorting to the poor diction it was along the lines of, these are the people who think Obama is the anti-Christ. Why these “pretty young, not that big [black kids who] were technically thugs” resorted along the lines of the poor diction Riehl employs is, I confess, a bit confusing. I believe the problem is that Riehl believes they are “technically thugs,” when in reality they are only “technically thugs,” meaning that they’re not thugs at all, but well-dressed young black conservatives on their way to celebrate Glenn Beck Day along with the likes of Dan Riehl. But that is just me resorting to the good hypothesis about the poor diction without seeing what exactly what they said was along the lines of, which was this: That McCain he wasn’t chit. It seems Riehl needs glasses, because it sounds like he was seated in front of ten or so terrible caricatures of Latino gangstas or, given how poor his ear for dialogue is along the lines of, possibly the Clay Davis family reunion. Fortunately for all involved, these kids who were only “technically thugs” behaved as kids who are only “technically thugs” do: It went on but not really to a level that was so loud, or so confrontational that it needed to be addressed. By “it,” Riehl means “they,” but don’t chalk that “it” up to poor diction: for Riehl and those like him, all black kids, even when they’re “pretty young [and] not that big,” are “technically thugs” and, as such, are undeserving of a pronoun that refers along the lines of people instead of things.

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/someone-took-in-these-pants.html"><span><strong>Someone took . . . in these pants.</strong> The news that Pavement is reuniting and touring next year is not unwelcome, but it is a harbinger of impending senescence of your host, who vividly remembers listening to the widely distributed pre-release tape of Slanted and Enchanted in early 1992 and pining over the absence of culture and spies in his quiet suburban neighborhood. He would say, as irate futurists do of flying cars, &quot;Where are my forty million daggers? I was promised forty million daggers!&quot; Pavement were the second or third most important band of his youth, behind only the Replacements and R.E.M., both of whom he discovered in the &quot;R&quot; section of a Rolling Stone album guide that he browsed at the local library after he had been gifted his first &quot;jam box&quot; in fourth grade. Understand: he did not want to waste his allowance on albums of insufficient quality, so he decided to research music and selected R.E.M.'s Murmur and the Replacements' Let It Be because both were awarded five stars and therefore guaranteed to be of the highest quality. Tickets for the September 18, 2010 show go on sale tomorrow and interest among aging hipsters who traded their indie cred in for a lectern is expected to be high. (As to the title of this post, below the fold can be found the obligatory YouTube of an Ouzo-soaked Alexander the Great being born from a box after having been struck by an automobile.)</span></a></div>
