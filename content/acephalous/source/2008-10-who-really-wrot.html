<p><strong>Part 1: The “Argument”</strong></p>
<p>According to Jack Cashill—in an article <a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=76731">first published</a> at WorldNetDaily—<em>Dreams from My Father</em>
was probably written by Bill Ayers. Cashill opens by demonstrating that
Obama, unlike every undergraduate ever, published crap poems in a
college literary journal. These crap poems “show not a glint of
promise,” Cashill tells us, nor did a “heavily edited, unsigned student
case comment” published in the <em>Harvard Law Review</em>.&nbsp; He then quotes an attorney consulted by <em>Politico</em>, who called it “a fairly standard example of the genre.”&nbsp; Cashill has a point here: </p>
<p>The “temperate legal language” of “a fairly standard example” of “a heavily edited, unsigned student case comment” <em>is</em>
completely different from the style Obama would employ a few years
later in his autobiography. Cashill is right to be suspicious. Who
wouldn’t write their autobiography in the temperate language of an
anonymous legal brief? What style is better suited to the tale of being
abandoned by a father and raised to be a black man by a white woman in
the wake of the Civil Right Movements? </p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141182229/diesekoschmar-20">None</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But Cashill isn’t content to let the matter rest on logic.&nbsp; He consults an expert—in this case, <a href="http://www.mathcs.duq.edu/%7Ejuola/">Patrick Juola</a> of the <a href="http://www.jgaap.com/">Authorship Attribution Program</a>—and
is advised to continue doing “good old-fashioned literary detective
work” of the sort that’s proven the plays of William Shakespeare were
written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespearean_authorship">Roger Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, William Stanley, Walter Raleigh, Edmund Spenser, or Edward de Vere</a>.&nbsp; Cashill is no ordinary literary detective: in the past he has been called upon <a href="http://www.cashill.com/natl_general/did_bill_ayers_write_3.htm">to rescue celebrity biographies</a>, so he recognizes when someone, in this case “[w]hoever rescued Barack Obama’s <em>Dreams from My Father</em>[,] invest[s] considerable time to invent a distinct voice and style for an unknown author.”&nbsp; And who is this someone?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Bill Ayers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>How does Cashill know?&nbsp; Because the “distinct voice and style” Ayers invents for Obama “<a href="http://www.cashill.com/natl_general/did_bill_ayers_write_1.htm">is surely Ayers’ [own]</a>.”&nbsp; Ayers invented a style—his own—then wrote <em>Dreams from My Father</em> in it.&nbsp; To the untrained eye, that may sound ridiculous; but as a Doctor of Philosophy of Literature, I assure you his “<a href="http://www.cashill.com/natl_general/did_bill_ayers_write_2.htm">deconstruction</a>” of Obama’s autobiography is sound and valid.&nbsp; </p>
<p>His technical argument begins by pointing out that both Obama’s <em>Dreams from My Father</em> and Ayers’ <em>Fugitive Days</em>
“are obsessed with memory and its instability.” Both address this
heretofore unheard topic in the history of autobiography in a very
similar style. Compare this passage from Obama:</p>
<blockquote><p>Identity is funny being yourself is funny as you are
never yourself to yourself except as you remember yourself and then of
course you do not believe yourself you do not really believe yourself
why should you, you know so well so very well that it is not yourself.</p></blockquote>
<p>To this one from Ayers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now it could not be yourself because you cannot remember
right and if you do remember right it does not sound right and of
course it does not sound right because it is not right. You are of
course never yourself.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1878972081/diesekoschmar-20/">obsession with the instability of memory</a>
should be evident even to those who have never ghost-written celebrity
autobiographies. But Cashill’s deconstruction is far from complete. He
amasses a boatload of irrefutable evidence:</p>
<ol><li>Both Obama and Ayers “use ’storms’ and ‘horizons’ as metaphor and as reality.”</li>

<li>“Ayers and Obama also speak often of waves and wind, Obama at least a dozen times on wind alone.”</li>

<li>The polyamorous Ayers has “<em>tangled</em> love affairs” while the undergraduate Obama has “<em>tangled</em> arguments.”</li>

<li>“On at least 12 occasions, Obama speaks of ‘despair,’” an emotion Ayers has been known to feel.</li>

<li>“Obama . . . has a fondness for the word ‘murky’ and its aquatic usages.”</li>

<li>Both . . . make conspicuous use of the word ‘flutter.’”</li>

<li>The “Fugitive Days” excerpt scores a 54 on reading ease and a 12th
grade reading level. The “Dreams’” excerpt scores a 54.8 on reading
ease and a 12th grade reading level. </li></ol>
<p>If Cashill’s math fails to convince you—54 is quite close to 54.8,
but numbers might not be to your taste—consider that in his analysis,
he “introduce[s his] own book, <em>Sucker Punch</em> . . . [a]s a control.”&nbsp; How much more scientific does his deconstruction need to be?</p>
<p><strong>Part Two: The Stupid</strong></p>
<p>At <em>The Corner</em>, Andy McCarthy <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTlkMTdmNDRkMTM1ODZkNGNkZmRiNDFjMDE4YzRjMjg=">evaluates</a>
Cashill’s argument and proves himself to be an idiot by finding
Cashill’s “lengthy analysis . . . thorough, thoughtful, and
alarming—particularly his deconstruction of the text in Obama’s memoir
and comparison to the themes, sophistication and signature phraseology
of Bill Ayers’ memoir.” To be blunt: if you find Cashill’s
identification of “sea imagery” and his lists of words both Obama and
Ayers use to be particularly anything other than laughable pablum,
you’re an <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/half-wit">eighth-wit</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If, however, you only use Cashill’s juvenile musings as <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13398">a hypothetical which, if true, suggests all the unsavory things you already believe about Obama</a>,
then you’ve fully embraced the Cashill Doctrine. What do I mean by
that? If you deconstruct Cashill’s name, you’ll find that it contains
the words “cash” and shill.” “Cash” refers to paper bank notes which,
in more robust times, could be exchanged for goods or services. A
“shill,” according to the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, is “one
who poses as a disinterested advocate of another but is actually of the
latter’s party; a mouthpiece, a stooge.” It goes without saying that
shills often shill for cash, but in this case, I think we can say the
shill’s shilling for cash and <a href="http://whiskeyfire.typepad.com/whiskey_fire/2008/10/very-competent.html">attention</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Because no one with any literary training can read Cashill’s tripe
without recognizing it as the shoddy work of a dim student asked to
compare and contrast two texts.</p>

<p>Actually, Scott, I think the cobbled-together nature of the Pentateuch is the very foundation of our faith: without the repetition and self-contradiction in the text, the Rabbinic tradition would never have developed. And without the Talmudic attempts to make sense of the random, to create continuity out of coalition, there’s no literary analysis. You, my friend, are the intellectual descendant of Hillel (I, on the other hand, am the intellectual descendant of Shammai; present in the text but rarely cited or taken much note of).</p>

<p>FWIW, my spouse has read <i>Audacity of Hope</i> and just started reading <i>Dream of my father</i> (both by audiobook), and is quite sure that the same person — the same ‘voice’ — wrote both. My spouse was very, very amused when I related this ghostwriter theory.<br />

<p>I&#39;ve actually read both Obama books---if you&#39;d like .pdf copies, all you need do is ask.  (And not necessarily me.  I asked someone who works for the campaign and they emailed me copies.  I think they&#39;re unofficial campaign literature at this point.)  But your spouse is correct, but only sort of: the voice of the introduction to <em>Dreams from My Father</em> approximates that of <em>The Audacity of Hope</em>, but the voice of <em>Dreams from My Father</em> itself is far more Baldwinian, and in a good way.  I mean, he&#39;s no James Baldwin, but for paragraphs at a time, you can&#39;t help but be impressed by his imitation.</p></span>

I get email.* I did not attend the second class and was supposed to be dropped automatically due to the second day rule, but I have to officially drop the course with your signature. When are you on campus today? This student is gently reminded that I told the class on the first day that the second day rule is not automatic, informed that I will not be on campus today and directed to the composition office. I get more email: I was wondering if there was any room in your 39B class from 9:30-10:50 a.m. I've been trying to get into a class and it seems like they're completely full! This student is politely informed that I only allow two unexcused absences per quarter, and that because my class has already met four times, it would be impossible for her to earn a passing grade. I get even more email: i need to add ur class wheres ur office so u can sign my add card This student is also informed that I only allow two unexcused absences per quarter, and that because my class has already met four times, it would be impossible for him to earn a passing grade. He responds: i can get excuses I want to inform him that I'm not sure how he can be absent in a course in which he isn't enrolled, but fear the inevitable literalism of his reply. (&quot;i wuznt there but have doctors note&quot;) So I tell him that I only allow four total absences because that amounts to twenty percent of the entire course, and a student who misses twenty percent of a course cannot earn a passing grade. He responds: i make up the work r u in ur office now I turn off the computer and re-read the material I'm teaching next week. He responds: wheres ur office to sign my card I compose study questions for my students. The computer is still off. He responds: need to no where ur office is to sign card soon I eat lunch. He responds: fine i dont hear from u soon u reget it I consider responding to ask what I'll get again, but needn't have bothered. He sent me a link. (And yet, I still miss love teaching, even though this happens every quarter.) *No actual students were harmed in the composition of this post. (But some of their stylistic tics may've been reproduced and mocked.)</span></a></div>

That's what you know that I mean, you know?** I mean, shit, I know shit's bad right now. With all that starving bullshit, and the dust storms, and we running out of french fries and burrito coverings, but there's a solution. A three-point plan to fix everything: Number 1: We've got this guy Not Sure. Number 2: He's got a higher IQ than any man alive. Number 3: He's going to fix everything—and he's so smart, he's gonna do it all in one week. Seriously: VOTE NOT SURE 2008! (And in that poll too, you know, for whatever and stuff.) *Brought to you by Carl's Jr. **Up yours, Thers!</span></a></div>
