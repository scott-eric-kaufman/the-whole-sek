<p>It&#39;s your blog, Scott. I&#39;m not convinced, though, that the jungle understands the distinction you&#39;re making, or will honor your boundaries. The analysis and commentary you were doing had value to your readers, though the resulting discussions may not have been up to your classroom standards. (I&#39;m not being snide: you&#39;re clearly a great classroom teacher. But you&#39;re not grading us, so we have less pressure to conform or even try.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115725147ab970b-content"><p><em>Good luck at the Feministe place. What could go wrong?</em></p>

<p>Only everything, but as it&#39;s a different everything, I thought I&#39;d clean the slate here.  That said, your presence isn&#39;t sullying, nor am I asking you to leave . . . I just don&#39;t want to play host to you and Rich&#39;s politicking.  </p>

<p><em>Here&#39;s to the new, apolitical SEK!</em></p>

<p>I said &quot;political,&quot; but what I really meant was, &quot;not dominated by the news cycle.&quot;  Having circumstance force me out of the news cycle for a week made me realize how much it&#39;d come to dominate my thoughts, and I didn&#39;t like that.  I&#39;m still going to be covering material that&#39;s political, as per the Gates comment, but I&#39;m not going to be covering it because everything on CNN must be addressed.  </p>

<p>Because, in all honesty, I found myself spending more and more time trying to find novel, intelligent approaches to topics everyone else was also writing about, and that&#39;s just not a productive use of my time.  (As I noted in the previous post, I have papers to revise, job folders to improve, and books to write.  If I spend all my spare mental space on what network suits deem important, I&#39;m never going to get all that done.)</p>

<p><em>As long as it involves comic books reasonably frequently, of course.</em></p>

<p>You&#39;ll be one of the few readers that I don&#39;t drive away in the next couple of months.</p>

<p><em>I&#39;m not convinced, though, that the jungle understands the distinction you&#39;re making, or will honor your boundaries.</em></p>

<p>Even if they don&#39;t understand the distinction, I&#39;m absolutely positive they&#39;ll honor my boundaries.  There&#39;s happyfeet up there this very moment, actively honoring it.  </p>

<p><em>The analysis and commentary you were doing had value to your readers, though the resulting discussions may not have been up to your classroom standards.</em></p>

<p>I appreciate that, Ahistoricality, and don&#39;t think you&#39;re being snide.  But it&#39;s not a matter of it being up to my classroom standards so much as it being so wholly different from my classroom that I don&#39;t know how to deal with it productively, nor, at the moment, do I have the time to figure out how to.</p>

<p><em> The jungle won&#39;t understand exactly where your boundaries are</em></p>

<p>My reference to &quot;the jungle&quot; was rhetorically oblique: I&#39;m thinking less of a place or the inhabitants of a place than what it takes on my part to interact with it and them.  So, no judgment on my part there, as in, I&#39;m not calling everyone to my right &quot;primitive,&quot; I&#39;m simply saying that interacting with said folks can get &quot;woolly,&quot; and needs to be done more carefully than I can do now if it&#39;s to be productive.</p>

<p><em>That thread can stand as the elephant.</em></p>

<p>The one that we&#39;re all holding a different part of, or the one that&#39;s not in the room?  </p>

<p><em>I pledge that I will keep reading this delightful blog until I stop. </em></p>

<p>And I pledge to be as delightful as possible for as long as possible, so you never have to.</p>

<p><em>Mission statements are tough since blogging works less on the mysterious logic of discovery and more on the outraged brain fart.</em></p>

<p>Mine never were, though.  Actually, some were, but those are the ones I deleted.  I never write angry, because when I do, I stop being funny and can&#39;t be cutting.  So not posting about whatever everyone else is posting about will be a simple matter of stopping myself from sitting down, figuring out what everyone else is posting about, finding a novel entry-point into the conversation, &amp;c.  For example, here&#39;s what I was going to post yesterday:</p>

<blockquote><b>It depresses me that this bit I wrote about the Birthers last week—but didn&#39;t post because it would soon be irrelevant—is still relevant.</b>

<blockquote>Members of the John Birth Society understand the importance of small details like <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/06/02/the-value-of-grammar/" rel="nofollow">the placement of a comma</a>.  But because Birthers are born hypocrites whose courage lacks the conviction of a bad check, the paranoid scrutiny they apply to official state records never extends to the singular document they claim to defend . . .  Article 2, Section 1, Clause 5 of which clearly states that the last legitimate President of these United States was Zachary Taylor:

<blockquote>No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States<strong>, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution,</strong> shall be eligible to the Office of President[.]</blockquote>

<p>All praise those insidious commas and the clause they bracket.  Because Old Rough and Ready (1784-1850) was the last President born before the Constitution was adopted, every President since---and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyler" rel="nofollow">one before</a>---failed to meet the requirement of having been born a citizen (natural or otherwise) before 1787.</blockquote></blockquote></p>

<p>At which point I continued illiterately parsing that clause when I realized that I could be expending that same close-reading energy on something like, say, my book manuscript.</p></span>

<p>Yeah, I <a href="http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com/2006/07/1001-ahistorical-posts.html" rel="nofollow">did more or less the same step-back</a> three years ago, with a six month return to regular political blogging for the election, but I&#39;ve really felt much calmer about things when I don&#39;t have to have something to say. I don&#39;t troll the carnivals for material, abandon a few of the RSS feeds that were more for tracking topics than real information, and just post when I really feel like it.</p>
