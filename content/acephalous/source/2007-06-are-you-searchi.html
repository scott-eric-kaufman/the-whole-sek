It records a brilliant display of nonacademic muddling through narrative complexities. Granted, given that Milch was once a Milton scholar, you'd think him better able to articulate his way through these knots; but if you forgive him those peccadillos, you snob, you'll see his talent for narrative was abundantly evident way back in the dark days of 2001.) When David Milch announced the death of Deadwood, like most fans of the show, I took consolation in the fact that HBO had already greenlit another Milch production, John From Cincinnati. (As to the two Deadwood films purported to be in preproduction, I hold my breath.) Given that it would be on HBO, I knew I needn't fear any diminishment of Milch's signature style: HBO would allow him to let rain spectacular profanity. (The suits might even encourage it.) Understand, then, that I watched the first episode of John From Cincinnati in mild disbelief: not only do the characters not speak like foul-mouthed miners, one of them begins the episode unable to say anything except &quot;the end is near&quot; and &quot;some things I know and some things I don't.&quot; More on that in a moment. The most memorable dialogue emerges from the interaction of Luis Guzman's &quot;Ramon Gaviota,&quot; Willie Garson's &quot;Meyer Dickstein,&quot; and Matt Winston's &quot;Barry Cunningham.&quot; Their connection to the overall story is (currently) tenuous: they are the lottery-winner (Cunningham) who purchases a motel in which one of the main characters lives; the motel's former owner (Dickstein); and its once and future manager (Gaviota). Cunningham is convinced that something is amiss in Room 24. When he first arrives, he explains to Dickstein why he's packing heat: Cunningham: I am armed in accordance with the State Lottery Commission's pamphlet The Challenge of Sudden Wealth, which urges that winners be cautious in the conduct of their business affairs. Dickstein: Do you have another gun? Cunningham: I did not buy a backup, against the advice of Pete's Pistol Hut. I didn't contract Cunningham's words because the defining characteristic of his speak is a stiltedness meant to betray a deeper reserve of awkwardness. After the main characters suffer (and recover from) an accident, this trio decides to do something nice for his family. Cunningham insists that they close the door to Room 24 (which he had left open when he sprinted from it earlier). Bumping into each other as they approach the door: Cunningham: Do you hear the dead man singing within, gentlemen? Gaviota: I'm half deaf from the leaf blower. Cunningham: Attorney Dickstein? Dickstein: Surfer's ear. Exostosis of the ear canal. Cunningham: I alone, then, am favored by that jovially croaking, post-coital falsetto winsomely caricaturing Debby Boone? Who but Milch would think to pen such a line? Unlike Deadwood, the people who speak like this on John From Cincinnati are clearly unbalanced. There is, for example, Ed O'Neill's &quot;Bill Jacks,&quot; who at one point warns the room...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/debbie-schlusse.html"><span><strong>Debbie Schlussel's Review of SiCKO</strong> I found abdiel's review of Schlussel's review of Live Free, Die Hard via Sadly, No! (Just so you know who I blame.) When I clicked over to Schlussel's site, I noticed his favorite solecism (&quot;It's hard to believe this third sequel to 1988's Die Hard is the fourth in a series&quot;) wasn't there. I assumed he'd juiced the stupid for effect, not that she'd edited it after he brought it to her attention. Diligent procrastinator that I am, I read some of her other movie reviews and, needless to say, I can state with certainty that she edited it after he brought it to her attention. Consider her review of SiCKO. She first argues that &quot;HMOs are ... socialized medicine.&quot; (I'm no proponent of E-Prime, but her copular slaughter almost convinces me to tack about.) This isn't a good argument, but it has the benefit of being an arguable one. The same can't be said of this: We already have the unworkable system of bad medicine that Moore wants. SiCKO is many things, but there's one thing it isn't: a defense of the status quo. HMOs may be (but really aren't) a form of socialized medicine. That's a (debatable, but wildly incorrect) fact. The claim that &quot;Moore wants the unworkable system of bad medicine we already have&quot; leaves me at a loss, so I'll quote Dorothy Parker: There are times when images blow to fluff, and comparisons stiffen and shrivel. Such an occasion is surely at hand when one is confronted by Dreiser's latest museum piece, Dawn. One can but revise a none-too-hot dialectic of childhood; ask, in rhetorical aggressiveness, &quot;What writes worse than a Theodore Dreiser?&quot;—loudly crow the answer, &quot;Two Theodore Dreisers&quot;; and, according to temperament, rejoice at the merciful absurdity of the conception, or shudder away from the thought. Sadly, the comments to her review leave no room for rejoicing. Shuddering is another story entirely. Moving on: The saddest spectacle in contemporary politics is not, as is often argued, to be caught unawares in one's own hypocrisy. No, the saddest spectacle is to be caught unawares in one's hypocrisy immediately after dismissing someone else for theirs. Case in point: Schlussel anecdotally berates Moore for this moment of self-deprecation: You're right. What can I say? I'm a hypocrite. Who says I'm consistent? She then notes that &quot;personal anecdotes by [sic] former Michael Moore employees [concerning the] lack of appropriate benefits and healthcare&quot; show that his self-deprecation cuts quicker to the truth than he intended. Those anecdotes bear witness to Moore's great lie. He is a hypocrite who wants Americans to do as he says, not as he does. Anecdotes like the one which opens her essay and the ones related by disgruntled employees speak hard truths to even the most jaded powers. They are completely different from those Moore employs in his coverage of Canadian healthcare: Moore shows us the short waiting time and zero cost of healthcare for his friends and relatives in Canada, just a quick drive...</span></a></div>
