The students immersed in the theory are the truly fluent ones, but those who aren&#39;t as involved and disdain it still appear to know the most gimmicky aspects of the language just enough to poke fun. This latter group has usually never read more than two original &#39;theoretical&#39; (which for most kids blurs into the category &#39;postmodern&#39;) texts, yet really get off hearing something like the Sokal Hoax.</p></span>

<p>Hm.  Might it just be possible, before you leap to taking sides against a caricature of the PC Police-Student, that this student spoken of only in clichés actually had a (more nuanced) point?  Lots of mixed-ethnic students have trouble confronting their own embeddedness in racist histories and ideology, and so jerk their knees like so, in a ready-made language with its own identity politics, to be sure.  It&#39;s possible, of course, that the spoken-of student really was an asshole, or at least relying (pedantically and lazily) on a ready-made language.  But at least he would still be a questioning asshole?  Still, that&#39;s only speculation.  All you heard was too students commiserating together (in a ready-made, anti-Theory language).</p></span>

		<span id="comment-12858502-content"><p>I&#39;m not taking sides in this, only pointing out the general lack of theoretical sophistication among students at a school with a reputation for theoretical sophistication.  Maybe the joke was too sutble.  I&#39;m <i>not</i> calling those bumbling undergraduates theoretically sophisticated, nor am I calling the subject of their conversation theoretically unsophisticated.  I <i>am</i> noting the general lack of theoretical sophistication in the undergraduate population at large, and pointing to both ways in which that can manifest itself: 1) the asshole so in love with the sound of his own mind that he diagnoses everyone of everything and 2) the asshole who can&#39;t tell whether the other asshole&#39;s just being an asshole or whether he has a legitimate point.  Both come under equal ridicule in the above post.  (Hence my hypothetical reply to LB: &quot;Yeah, like the kids would&#39;ve been paying attention or doing the reading or something.&quot;)  Or did you think I was siding with those two eloquent souls?</p>

<p>Now I&#39;ve add a &quot;necessarily&quot; to disambiguate the point: &quot;But they&#39;re by no means necessarily <i>less</i> sophisticated than the ideologue whose behavior they so colorfully declaimed.&quot;  That wasn&#39;t an anti-PC or anti-Theory broadside, Matt, so much as an excuse to type the phrase &quot;the politics of why no one listens to you&quot; and use the word the &quot;lemmata&quot; in public.  </p></span>

<p>Yep, I could really see it -- Keanu in dark glasses playing Scott, with the argument outside and attempted sex inside the office going on at the same time with Scott standing in the opened doorway, coolly saying things about whether this is going to affect his evolutionary experiments, and the people inside and outside the office hearing each other&#39;s lines and thinking that they&#39;re talking to each other.</p>

<p>Must stop myself from writing a few paragraphs of this parody.... OK.</p></span>

Then again, that&#39;s all a race is anyway, but since I deny identity politics philosophical coherence (but not political purpose, since I realize the benefits they&#39;ve had on American politics, although, once co-opted, they also have the potential to be otherwise).  I don&#39;t think the belief that opposition to that beast I Theory--by which I mean a series of intellectual attitudes attached, though not necessarily, to an identifiable body of work--can function as an identity category.

<p>Nope.  I have a <i>new</i> office now.  Actually, it&#39;s not mine, it belongs to a professor kind enough to let me use his office when he isn&#39;t.  (And since he&#39;s now in administration, he&#39;s never in it.)  It&#39;s actually quite nice.  It has a desk.  No boxes.  No clutter.  A fully stocked library of Theory-with-a-capital-T books (the generous man in question edited <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/8711.html" rel="nofollow">this book</a>) and early and 19th century Americanist criticism.  And <i>no internet connection</i>.  I can work uninterrupted by my own baser instincts for hours on end.  Paradise.  A vacation from myself, really.</p>

<p>Not that that means I can&#39;t follow through with this: <i>Clearly you are setting yourself up to pitch a screenplay for a movie in which, mysteriously, a grad student&#39;s office becomes the focus for all the getting-it-on being got on at School Today.</i>  If you finish that parody, I&#39;ll slap my name on it and send it off.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-12859536-content"><p>Yeah, I think what we&#39;ve got here is your typical &quot;undigested lecture notes&quot; problem.  It&#39;s really bad with theory, in which, like boullion, a little goes a long way.  It&#39;s not restricted to theory, though.  I remember teaching *Oroonoko* and giving my students a brief historical lecture on the English Civil War.  When it was repeated back to me in their response papers, it was oddly distorted, sort of like what happens when you stick a foreign language poem into an on-line translator.  Which was really interesting, cuz the students could still often make coherent historicized arguments, even with bad history -- which led to my suspicion of historicism.  That is, given text A and history B, we can explain A via B even if we get B wrong.   </p>

<p>But the point is that it&#39;s always scary to hear undigested knowledge being thrown around.  It&#39;s probably scarier when the knowledge is of the &quot;ethnic studies&quot; variety and the &quot;throwing around&quot; is of the interpersonal conflict variety.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-12889157-content"><p>Grammar fixed, Ben.  Now it should be clear that I&#39;m building something mind-blowingly awesome.  </p>

<p>Kenneth and Matt, I must be missing something.  I think there is a group of people who don&#39;t believe Theory-with-a-capital-t exists.  Don&#39;t y&#39;all belong to it?  I mean, haven&#39;t you both on occasion argued that what I call cap-T Theory you don&#39;t consider nearly so coherent?  To reiterate, I&#39;m not anti-theoretical, nor am I even anti-Theoretical  . . . although I&#39;m certainly anti-psychoanalytic and -psychoanalytically-informed.  But unless I&#39;m particularly dense this afternoon, I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re getting at.  Are you saying cap-T Theory only exists because I think it does, and that therefore this debate, like any about the logic of speciation, depends upon fluid borders instead of essential categories, and that the coterie of characteristics I&#39;ve identified with cap-T Theory isn&#39;t enough?  Because rhetorically, that&#39;s a potentially powerful argument, but it&#39;s one that can be used against any attempt to label anything: &quot;No, it&#39;s not nearly so distinct or internally coherent as you think it is, therefore you can&#39;t consider it a single category.  You know, like dogs.  Daschunds and German Shepards.&quot;</p></span>

		<span id="comment-12949430-content"><p>I&#39;m dense myself, and I&#39;ve been engaged in a sustained mental attrition brought on by intense baby-care over the last 30 hours, but I personally have never understood why people believe that &quot;hey, that&#39;s a good argument but I think it might apply to everything, so I&#39;ll simply discount it&quot; to be a remotely compelling rejoinder.  I&#39;m not saying that this rejoinder accurately describes what I was hinting at above, but I mean seriously, as people who spend our time thinking about the specificity of various artifacts, shouldn&#39;t we expect a bit more interest in the specificity of a given claim, specifically here the claim regarding cap-T theory, and shouldn&#39;t we also be inherently suspicious of any attempt at an elision/reduction predicated on the so-called Linneaan Blues?  Is it so difficult to say &quot;hmm, given the political overtones of a claim to believe in/produce cap-T Theory, maybe I should pay a bit more attention to the structure and reasons that animate such a self-fulfilling prophecy, if indeed it is one, and I think the amount of attention i give this question should be greater than the effort I might expend over a concern that I might have over unfairly or imprecisely deployed the term &#39;dog&#39;&quot;?</p>

<p>In this particular case, yes, of course it matters that there are what you call fluid boundaries and not essential categories, but that&#39;s hardly the locus of the objection.  The distinction between the two of those ideas is specious anyway, as the two contaminate each other from the start, something with which the vast majority of readers here would no doubt agree.  The objection, if there is one in general (read: elsewhere, like at The Valve) to this practice, to this type of terminological production, it has nothing to do with the general ontological failure of a taxonomy and everything to do with the political and ideological consequences that attend the belief in the soundness of one&#39;s production of a taxonomy and the dangers that attend the belief that one is innocent of involvement in such a self-fulfilling endeavor, or the assumption that such an involvement is necessary and therefore excused from serious investigation.  So no, I&#39;m not so much concerned with the political fallout from our canine friends being lumped together, but I am concerned about the use of race, the odd anthropology that undergirds the concept of the human, and indeed, the whole delineation of a capital T-theory.</p>

<p>That being said, there was no objection listed here of course, just a note that you believe it, lots of people believe it, and thus, cap-T theory exists.  Much as any other discursive concept emerges from mutually sustaining discourses that function independently of any necessary question of a referent or testable object.  Much as the Universe exists thanks to our looking at it.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/01/cockawhooping_f.html"><span><strong>Cockawhooping Frey into A Million Little Pieces</strong> Richard Watson Gilder's response to the publication of the infamous little magazine Yellow Book: The amount of attention that this periodical has attracted is proof, if any were needed, that the mountebank in his motley can call the crowd; but is that all the editors of this quarterly and are aiming at? Have they yet to learn that notoriety is not fame? They claim that the Yellow Book is the embodiment of the modern spirit. If this is true, then give us the old-fashioned spirit . . . whose aim is to please intelligent people and not to attract attention by &quot;tripping the cockawhoop&quot; in public. Indeed! We shall not brook the tripping of such cockawhooping mountebanks as late-period Henry James in our manly American culture! (With typical restraint, the OED defines &quot;cock-a-hoop&quot; as &quot;drinking without stint&quot; and the various behaviors associated therewith.) But even though Gilder impresses upon his readers that it is the drunken revelry which offends &quot;us [of] the old-fashioned spirit,&quot; the Yellow Book folded in 1897 because of its association with a man whose work it never printed (Oscar Wilde) but with whom it shared an illustrator (Aubrey Beardsley). The Yellow Book's unwarranted demise comes to mind today for a very particular reason: the furor over the exaggerated cockawhooping of Oprah darling James Frey. Look how far we've evolved as a culture. Once upon a time back when people (even Americans!) were Victorians, thinly veiled autobiographical fictions about ambiguously gendered but patently homosexual aristocrats could put a little magazine out of business. In our more evolved culture, you'll be pilloried for lying about a brutal root-canal surgery accomplished sans anesthesia or an airplane trip during which you're bleeding through a hole in cheek while wearing cloths covered &quot;with a colorful mixture of spit, snot, urine, vomit and blood&quot; or kicking a homosexual Catholic priest in the balls fifteen times. See what improvements time has wrought? Before Frey would have been imprisoned for writing about doing what he'd done. Now some suggest he should go to prison for not having done what he wrote about doing. (All those people, I should add, skulk around message boards formerly devoted to singing Frey's praises. Now they want blood . . . but not spit, snot, urine or vomit. They'll let him keep that. And his infamy. He can keep that too.) There's an interesting marital dilemma at the heart of this concerning Gay Talese, to whom the NY Times turned to for quotations about the ethics of fabrication in books stamped non-fiction, and Nan Talese, whose vanity imprint published Frey's book. I'll touch upon it later. Right now I have some self-imposed deadline dissertating to do.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/01/the_peabody_jou.html"><span><strong>The Peabody Journal of Education's &quot;Proverbs For English Teachers&quot; . . .</strong> . . . circa 1943: The best English teacher is the one who knows the most about everything else. Great English does not come from below the elbow. Every class is an English class. Meet increased teaching load with increased pupil responsibility. Every class is an examination, and every examination is a class. Man has capitalized woman's curiosity as scientific research. English must first of all communicate. I can encourage learning, I can give some opportunity for learning, but the learning is the pupil's and not the teacher's. The wise teacher prepares his pupils for the leisure that certainly will be theirs. Enjoyment of literature is a highly personal matter. Sentence sense is necessary to clear, logical thinking. Both mind-set and drill are necessary before correct speech habits can be formed. Diagramming is to grammer what graphing is to mathematics. Write and speak so that you cannot be misunderstood. Words have personalities. Speak-easy words do not belong in drawing-rooms. Sloppy diction usually means sloppy thinking. I have successfully resisted the urge to include a running commentary, but if someone could tell me what &quot;Great English does not come from below the elbow&quot; and &quot;Man has capitalized woman's curiosity as scientific research&quot; mean I'd be much obliged.</span></a></div>
