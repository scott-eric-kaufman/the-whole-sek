To me, not only is the satire here unbearably heavy-handed, it&#39;s shamelessly swiped from &quot;Digging the Weans&quot; by Robert Nathan (<i>Harper&#39;s</i> Nov &#39;56, frequently reprinted).</p></span>

Sort of. &quot;Scott Kaufman&quot; is credited with &quot;peek[ing] under Clio's blouse&quot; for this post over here. &quot;Scott Eric Kaufman&quot; is credited with initiating a discussion about &quot;oversimplified historical causation&quot; for this post over at the Valve. I believe the good folks at Spinning Clio have done me the favor of not associating one with the other. I only hope the folks they point over here don't read this post. Then the game'd be all up. [NOTE TO SPOUSES: The History Carnival has a section called &quot;Welcome To...Medieval Times!&quot; Much good for spouses to read there.]</span></a></div>
