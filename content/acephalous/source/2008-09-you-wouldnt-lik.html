How much evidence do you need in order to conclude that it&#39;s a worthless blog with an intellectually dishonest poster and a host of commenters who think that &quot;yah he&#39;s socialist, he&#39;s a commie&quot; is the height of argument?</p>

<p>For the sake of sanity you have to be willing to give up on certain people who have proven, over and over, that they don&#39;t want to think.  At this point, that includes everyone remaining in the Republican party.  Sure, their actions have to be dealt with, just as we have to deal with the next hurricane that rolls up to Louisiana, but you don&#39;t have to waste brain cells trying to fit their confused mush of garble into proper boxes.  You can&#39;t make them be coherent, because they don&#39;t think.</p></span>

  Bottom line.</p>

<p>  Almost half of O!&#39;s supporters think that judges should  ignore the Constitution, and go by what they &quot;feel&quot;.</p>

<p>  Great idea!</p>

<p>  See you in the Socialist Republic of the United States in a few years.</p>

<p>  I guess I was lucky enough to have graduated before the proggs hi-jacked our schools. Before history, economics, and civics were banished to the hinterlands.</p>

<p>  Why?</p>

<p>  Because any one of those three would let our children know just what a bunch of power tripping dolts are trying to take over this country, and how specious their arguments are. Where in the Constitution does it say that government can tell you <i>what to eat?</i> And you proggs will destroy everything this country has ever stood for.</p>

<p>  FACTS! But they have no bearing on the progg reality. It&#39;s all &quot;How do you feeeeeeel?&quot;</p>

<p>  Be careful what you wish for, it&#39;s liable to come true.</p>

<p>  I see equality of opportunity, you seem to see equality of misery - OH! EXCUSE ME! Equality of outcome. I have screwed up many times in my life, <i>but it&#39;s nobody&#39;s problem but mine! I can stand on my own two feet, and will, no matter how much I screw up. &quot;Oh! Please save me, Mr. Government!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>  Absolutely ridiculous, and an idea that flies in the face of history.</p>

<p>  Oh! But I forgot! The proggs <i>this time</i> will get it RIGHT! Because they are so much smarter than any of the billions of people who have lived before them. </p>

<p>  Forget Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Hitler, and all the others who have killed hundreds of MILLIONS of people.</p>

<p>  You are so much smarter. History has no bearing here, right? WE ARE THE PINNACLE OF HUMANITY!</p>

<p>  Baloney. You are a bunch of egotistical clowns who think that you are smarter than anyone else.</p>

<p>  Well, you ain&#39;t. And if you get what you think you want, you will regret your &quot;holier than thou&quot; attitude.</p>

<p>  You guys are <i>so much smarter than they were!</i><br />
 This time, you&#39;ll get it right, and only have to kill a few hundred thousand people who refuse to accept your fascist state.</p>

<p>   Happy ground hog day, stupid.</p></span>

<p>  The reason sarah Palin scares the bejeebus out of the left is that she is exactly the woman that they have been braying about. </p>

<p>  Unfortunately, her political orientation does not please the &quot;feministas&quot; (or should I say &quot;Pisses them off because she is not a whiner?) who have been begging for a strong and intelligent woman like her. To bad she believes in taking care of herself and her family.</p>

<p>  She doesn&#39;t fit the progg template, and in trying to destroy her, the idiots have driven way, way, many people into McCain/Palin&#39;s arms.</p>

<p>  Get your lawyers ready. A thousand lawyers, and a progg judge might give you a slim chance of stealing this election.</p>

Will some generous soul read over my Twain chapter for 1) typos and 2) egregiously stupid statements?* I wouldn't ask, but I have to turn this thing in on Wednesday and have the editorial near-sightedness which comes from being too close to a text. The chapter is barely this side of awful—fitful pacing, signposts everywhere, ghastly prose—but at this point I'm more worried about done than good.** I'm trying to avoid this is all. You can download it here. I found me a mensch. If you would like to read it, send me an email. *Cut-and-paste errors mostly: lack of transitions, re-introducing something already introduced, not introducing something I seem to be referring back to, &amp;c. **That's not false humility. The chapter is truly awful for reasons which I could (and will in the future) describe. But it is not good. Nor is it representative of my work generally. (In conception, maybe, but not in execution.)</span></a></div>
