Locked.</strong> Over on theoria I find myself embroiled in the Groundhog Day of academic debates: Someone writes something insulting. Someone else is insulted by it. The initial insulter accuses the insultee of being insulting. At this point (and the matter stands at this point) the insulted party faces a decision. Should he ignore the original slight? Should he attempt to communicate why he believes the insulter unaware of the insulting content of his initial insulting comment? If he opts for the latter should he focus on the instance in which the insulter roundaboutly suggested other scholars tend &quot;venal and pathetic&quot; and favor &quot;the gestures of a cop&quot;? Should he attack the implied argument that scholars whose methods differ from those of the insulter are unthinking and unfeeling? How should he communicate to the insulter that whatever invective wound its way into that vigorous response was justified by the insults which peppered his? Intellectual honesty demands that I attack something. I'm inclined to attack the discourse speaking through the insulter instead of the insulter himself. Because I do believe it a matter of the rhetorical niceties of certain theoretical discourses. Some budding scholars are taught to consider what they do as &quot;thinking the new.&quot; When they engage other scholars they are bound to relegate the work of these other scholars to categories like &quot;the old.&quot; Or &quot;partisan defender[s] of the faith for the existing state of things.&quot; Why? Because they are unable to see beyond the deadlocks of their own devising. To base the category of &quot;the new&quot; on further elaborations of Lacanian libinidal economies is to condemn, categorically, all work which fails to conform to one's assumptions as complicit in the ideology of the old. No No No No No. Or to quote Adam quoting Karl Barth: NEIN! The failure of imagination which produces that rhetorical affiliation of philosophical positions should be stricken from the record. For me to deny the explanatory power of a Lacanian libidinal economy is not to declare undying devotion to the status quo. I hazard these three hypotheses: Only in an environment devoid of honest intellectual interaction could such a rhetorical gesture flourish. Only in an environment in which sub-sub-sub-disciplines thrive in intellectual isolation from each other could such a rhetorical gesture flourish. Only in an environment in which debate has been denuded of its intellectual content and reduced to a series of ideologically loaded gesticulations could such a rhetorical gesture flourish. So I think this post means I'm finished with that thread. It has taken an interesting turn with Craig's discussion of how &quot;the real world&quot; works as rhetorical thunder. It has taken an interesting turn with Craig's discussion of the cudgel-cracking done under the auspices of &quot;the real world&quot; . . . but who am I kidding? I have theoria open in another window and am waxing my bludgeon with one hand while typing with the other. No I don't. Yes I do. No I don't. Yes I do. No I don't. Yes I...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/01/cockawhooping_f.html"><span><strong>Cockawhooping Frey into A Million Little Pieces</strong> Richard Watson Gilder's response to the publication of the infamous little magazine Yellow Book: The amount of attention that this periodical has attracted is proof, if any were needed, that the mountebank in his motley can call the crowd; but is that all the editors of this quarterly and are aiming at? Have they yet to learn that notoriety is not fame? They claim that the Yellow Book is the embodiment of the modern spirit. If this is true, then give us the old-fashioned spirit . . . whose aim is to please intelligent people and not to attract attention by &quot;tripping the cockawhoop&quot; in public. Indeed! We shall not brook the tripping of such cockawhooping mountebanks as late-period Henry James in our manly American culture! (With typical restraint, the OED defines &quot;cock-a-hoop&quot; as &quot;drinking without stint&quot; and the various behaviors associated therewith.) But even though Gilder impresses upon his readers that it is the drunken revelry which offends &quot;us [of] the old-fashioned spirit,&quot; the Yellow Book folded in 1897 because of its association with a man whose work it never printed (Oscar Wilde) but with whom it shared an illustrator (Aubrey Beardsley). The Yellow Book's unwarranted demise comes to mind today for a very particular reason: the furor over the exaggerated cockawhooping of Oprah darling James Frey. Look how far we've evolved as a culture. Once upon a time back when people (even Americans!) were Victorians, thinly veiled autobiographical fictions about ambiguously gendered but patently homosexual aristocrats could put a little magazine out of business. In our more evolved culture, you'll be pilloried for lying about a brutal root-canal surgery accomplished sans anesthesia or an airplane trip during which you're bleeding through a hole in cheek while wearing cloths covered &quot;with a colorful mixture of spit, snot, urine, vomit and blood&quot; or kicking a homosexual Catholic priest in the balls fifteen times. See what improvements time has wrought? Before Frey would have been imprisoned for writing about doing what he'd done. Now some suggest he should go to prison for not having done what he wrote about doing. (All those people, I should add, skulk around message boards formerly devoted to singing Frey's praises. Now they want blood . . . but not spit, snot, urine or vomit. They'll let him keep that. And his infamy. He can keep that too.) There's an interesting marital dilemma at the heart of this concerning Gay Talese, to whom the NY Times turned to for quotations about the ethics of fabrication in books stamped non-fiction, and Nan Talese, whose vanity imprint published Frey's book. I'll touch upon it later. Right now I have some self-imposed deadline dissertating to do.</span></a></div>
