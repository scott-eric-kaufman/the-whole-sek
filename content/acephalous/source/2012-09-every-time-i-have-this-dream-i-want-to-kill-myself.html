The next post in this series can be found here. The course blog, which is currently still in the demo stage so don't judge, is here.) In the previous post we established that the director of &quot;Winter Is Coming,&quot; Tim Van Patten, went to great lengths to transform Will into a sympathetic character. He can choose immediate death at the cold hands of the white walker or run back to Winterfell and face immediate death for having deserted his post on the wall. He chose the latter, which in terms of prolonging his life was the correct choice, but eventually his decision caught up with him: As hinted in the previous post, this shot is almost a graphic match that straddles the opening credits. Will's forlorn face as he decides to run to this death rather than face the other resembles, in a compositional sense, this medium long shot of his capture. The difference is one of scale, and it's an understandable one, as the previous medium close-up highlighted his pained indecision, whereas this medium long shot diminishes him to the &quot;proper&quot; height of one about to be beheaded. But as I noted in the previous post, Will is but a directorial tool—a means to a sympathy-creating ends. The deep focus in the shot above emphasizes the fact that despite the fact that Will's in the middle of an open field, he's surrounded and escape is impossible. Unlike when he was north of the wall and the danger was effectively hidden in plain sight and shallow focus, south of the wall, easily spotted threats arrive from all directions. Hence, the look of resignation on Will's face. Not that Will matters. He doesn't. He's but a means to an end, and that end is the introduction of the rigorously structured points of view present in the novel. This episode, &quot;Winter Is Coming,&quot; translates nine chapters of Game of Thrones from the page to the screen. Ignoring, for the moment, Daenerys I and II, which cover happenings an ocean away, the episode must introduce the perspectives presented in Bran I, Catelyn I, Eddard I, Jon I, Catelyn II and Bran II. Without going full-Rashomon, how can Van Patten accomplish this? By introducing their internal thoughts and feelings via their reactions to Poor Will's unfortunate fate. The shot above follows some of the riders to an establishing shot of Winterfell: Without knowing anything else about what's going on here, what has Van Patten communicated? Unlike the inhumanely scaled wall presented in the Prologue, this castle is imposing but clearly of human design and repair. It's also clearly a castle, which creates in the audience the expectation that they'll be meeting the groomers and smithies and kitchen wards. Of course not: if Van Patten had cut to a crack in the castle wall large enough for someone half-starved to slip through, that might be the case, but he cut...</span></a></div>

Please &quot;Like&quot; the Facebook page (and share with like-minded friends) if you find the site's manifesto compelling (which you should): We believe access to the jobs list should be available to all prospective faculty members, not just those with financial means. We believe that a policy that publishes the list “openly” only occasionally, and gives full access to others who pay, isn’t really open. We believe that the profession is better served by being transparent and accessible. We believe that if other professional academic organizations can distribute their lists freely, than so can the MLA. (The MLA should be a leader, not a follower.) (American Historical Association and American Mathematical Society are both free.) We believe that a policy which requires individuals to choose between paying and restricted access hurts the most disadvantaged of our community. We believe that all those who are part of the MLA community should help address this problem and distribute the job list, however and whenever possible.</span></a></div>
