			<p>So wrote Kafka on LF 304 and BrF 444.&nbsp; No, I don’t know what those mean either.&nbsp; Princeton only posted Stanley Corngold’s <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8791.html">introduction</a> to <em>Franz Kafka: The Office Writings</em>,
so the citations function as cryptic references to private files
collected, collated, duplicated and made available to people in the
employ of a vast bureaucracy.* (Apt, ain’t it?) Corngold likes to pair
the titular quotation with nonce word from Br 384 and L 333: <em>Schriftstellersein</em>, which he translates here as “the being of a writer,” but <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/daed.2007.136.2.79?cookieSet=1">elsewhere</a> [.pdf] as “the condition of being a writer.&quot;**&nbsp; 

</p>

<p>
His intention, here as at that elsewhere, is to create a continuum between Kafka’s <em>Schriftstellersein</em> and his <em>Beamtensein</em>,
or “official self,” that is, between the literature he scratched out
between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. and the sanctioned documents he produced at
the Workmen’s Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. 
Intuitively, this seems as sound as “Petition of the Toy Producers’
Association” sounds like it could adorn one of his short stories. 
There’s a catch: </p>
<p>
Kafka didn’t write “Petition of the Toy Producers’ Association,” but “Petition of the Toy Producers’ Association <em>in Katharinaberg, Erzgebirge</em>,”
a title whose specificity ruins its effect.&nbsp; It’s a document Kafka
never distilled, never labored over as he did his literary work.&nbsp; Not
that he wasn’t an able lawyer: on 26 November 1912, he won a settlement
of 4,500 kronen on behalf of the Institute, but he did so on a
“maddening trip to Kratzau” (<em>LF</em> 64).&nbsp; Why “maddening”?&nbsp; Because it’d interrupted the proper composition of “The Metamorphosis”:
</p>
<blockquote><p>This kind of story should be written with no more than
one interruption, in two ten-hour sessions; then it would have its
natural spontaneous flow . . . . But I haven’t got twice ten hours at
my disposal.&nbsp; So one has to try to do the best one can, since the very
best has been denied to one. (<em>LF</em> 64)</p></blockquote>
<p>
Obviously, Kafka’s emphasis is formal, not rhetorical here--the <em>flow</em>
of the story shaped by experience of its composition--but that’s my
point: when Kafka stood before the District Court of Kratzau in
November 1912, he read a document he’d written to persuade the Court to
settle in his favor.&nbsp; It’s no more literary than the fifty-three
letters he’d written Felice Bauer in November and December 1912 to
persuade her that he would visit, couldn’t visit, wouldn’t visit, must
visit, will visit never mind won’t visit her that Christmas.&nbsp; (That’s
undecidability in action, folks.***) Not that it isn’t important.&nbsp; As
an historicist, I value the documents in the same way I value the
letters.&nbsp; But I don’t understand the desire for equivalence here.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Kafka may’ve written <em>about</em> and <em>on behalf of</em>
bureaucracies, and there’s no small amount of interest in the
intersection, but that’s no reason to collapse one into the other. 
This isn’t like David Foster Wallace’s <a href="http://blog.oup.com/2008/11/writers-thesaurus/">notes for <em>The Oxford American Writer’s Thesaurus</em></a>,
which are aimed at writers composed in his signature stylistic quirk. 
Or is it?&nbsp; Talk me down, people, lest I flatten every last bit of word <em>by</em> a genius <em>into</em>.&nbsp; <a href="http://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/2008/11/04/41138/">That way lies madness</a>.

		<span id="comment-138240418-content"><p>I happen (bravely) to have Briefe handy. There&#39;s a bit of context (which I also remember the introduction to The Basic Kafka mentioning). A graphologist (at his boarding house) suggested, based on his handwriting, a bunch of things that (if my German suffices) Kafka balks at. Including the idea that he might have &quot;an interest in art&quot;. His answer is, essentially, that he doesn&#39;t have an <i>interest in</i> literature (i.e., art), he is <i>composed of</i> literature. He is an artist and can be nothing else. Now, he may just be posturing, but if he is right then the argument that that petition is a work of art hold. When he wrote it, he could have been nothing other than an artist.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is Kafka&#39;s desire for equivalence that is most interesting here.</p></span>

He quotes a bit from Book XI of The Prelude so that American conservatives might better understand how their liberal counterparts feel tonight. Here's some of the Wordsworth he cherry-picked: O pleasant exercise of hope and joy! For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood Upon our side, us who were strong in love! Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, But to be young was very Heaven! O times, In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways Of custom, law, and statute, took at once The attraction of a country in romance! Superficial readers of Great Books make this sort of mistake all the time. They half-remember some passage from their undergraduate Brit Lit survey and feel wicked clever. They think: &quot;'The attraction of a country in romance'? Sounds like Obama. The world must know that I once read a Lake Poet. To the internet!&quot; Then they post a passage from The Prelude in which Wordsworth mocks his younger self for the optimism he felt during the first days of the French Revolution. So what does Brookhiser think it's like to be a liberal in America today? It's like being an old goat who's spent decades rewriting an epic poem about his intellectual development while he's deriding the only moment in his entire life in which he allowed optimism to enter his black heart. For a second I thought he might've claimed this on purpose, so that when liberals are fed up with an inadequately leftist Obama he can link to that post and say, &quot;I told you! You didn't realize it at the time, you uneducated twunts, but I told you!&quot; Then he'll insert the ellipsed bits: In the main outline, such it might be said Was my condition, till with open war Britain opposed the liberties of France. This threw me first out of the pale of love; Soured and corrupted, upwards to the source, My sentiments; was not, as hitherto, A swallowing up of lesser things in great, But change of them into their contraries; And thus a way was opened for mistakes And false conclusions, in degree as gross, In kind more dangerous. What had been a pride, Was now a shame . . . He'll claim: &quot;I told them they would be disappointed in someone new! Did they listen? Of course not!&quot; Once our &quot;events brought less encouragement&quot; and were &quot;[w]orn out in greatness, stripped of novelty,&quot; Brookhiser'll pop from the bushes and shock us with his erudite ellision and we'll be forced to admit we'd been punked by a Joe Sixpack who happened to graduate from Yale. Then I remembered the sort of mind I was dealing with and drew a bath. (x-posted.)</span></a></div>
