Here’s the “funny” rape “joke” that caused the fuss: As you know, Ashley Judd has recently been heard equating both mining and purchasing Apple Products to “rape.” So my commentary at CPAC on her stupid, and insensitive comparisons was exactly this “This just in, Ashley Judd just tweeted that purchasing apple products is akin to rape … from her iPhone.” Crowder was, according to himself, “Clearly taking aim at Ashley Judd for her stupid rape comments.” Which is all well and good, had the comments Judd made remotely resembled the ones Crowder attributed to her. Before getting to Crowder, let’s look at our favorite Confederate’s defense of him: By tagging Crowder as a “Fox News contributor,” the writer of the HuffPo item signaled to liberal readers that the young comic is a hate-object. It’s wrong to call Crowder a “Fox News contributor,” according to McCain, because it “signal[s]” something to liberal readers. You know who that criticism should be aimed at? The person who runs “stevencrowder.net” and identifies him “FoxNew’s brightest, funniest young Conservative mind.” Doesn’t that person know what he’s signalling? His affiliation with Fox notwithstanding, Crowder’s comment is clueless for the simple reason that Judd never claimed that purchasing an Apple product was “akin,” metaphorically, to rape. She said, according to that bastion of liberal propaganda, The Daily Caller: I am financing mass rape as I enjoy these ridiculously Global North ultra-efficiencies and conveniences, for large scale rape is the preferred predation mining interests use to humiliate and terrify local populations, in order to control resource areas. The relationship she describes there isn’t one in which purchasing an Apple product is “akin” to committing rape, but one in which purchasing material something built with “conflict minerals” makes one complicit in the brutal tactics of the regimes who mine them. The difference between Crowder’s summary and Judd’s actual statement couldn’t be more stark: he thinks she equates all evils with “rape,” you know, like liberals do; whereas she’s specifically identifying how rape is used in a particular cultural context to “convince” people to work for slave-wages. I’m not saying that Judd hasn’t made outlandish statements in the past, but this strikes me as Crowder doing what John Nolte and Jeff Goldstein and every other anti-political correctness crusader loves to do: telling jokes that white men are forbidden to tell by the dark and womanly multicultural establishment. Because it’s just as bleeding edge now as it was in ’77. [x-posted and vigorouly commented upon at LGM.]" />

			<p>CPAC supporters are <a href="http://spectator.org/archives/2013/03/18/the-liberal-media-lie-about-cp">very</a> <a href="http://theothermccain.com/2013/03/17/the-huffington-post-lies-about-steven-crowders-cpac-monologue/">upset</a> that <em>The Huffington Post </em>“<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/16/steven-crowder-ashley-judd_n_2892984.html">lied</a>” about&#0160; “comedian” Steven Crowder’s criticisms of Ashley Judd. Here’s the “funny” rape “joke” that caused the fuss:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you know, Ashley Judd has recently been heard equating
 both mining  and purchasing Apple Products to “rape.” So my commentary 
at CPAC on her  stupid, and insensitive comparisons was exactly this 
“This just in, Ashley Judd just tweeted that purchasing apple products 
is akin to rape … from her iPhone.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crowder was, according to himself, “Clearly taking aim at Ashley Judd
 for her stupid rape comments.” Which is all well and good, had the 
comments Judd made remotely resembled the ones Crowder attributed to 
her. Before getting to Crowder, let’s look at our favorite Confederate’s
 defense of him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By tagging Crowder as a “Fox News contributor,” the 
writer of the HuffPo item signaled to liberal readers that the young 
comic is a hate-object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s wrong to call Crowder a “Fox News contributor,” according to 
McCain, because it “signal[s]” something to liberal readers. You know 
who that criticism should be aimed at? The person who runs “<a href="http://stevencrowder.net/">stevencrowder.net</a>” and identifies him “FoxNew’s brightest, funniest young Conservative mind.” Doesn’t that person know what he’s signalling?</p>
<p>His affiliation with Fox notwithstanding, Crowder’s comment is 
clueless for the simple reason that Judd never claimed that purchasing 
an Apple product was “akin,” metaphorically, to rape. She said, <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/03/11/in-2010-ashley-judd-accused-apple-customers-of-financing-mass-rape/#ixzz2NrVukZgf">according to that bastion of liberal propaganda, <em>The Daily Caller</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am financing mass rape as I enjoy these ridiculously 
Global North  ultra-efficiencies and conveniences, for large scale rape 
is the  preferred predation mining interests use to humiliate and 
terrify local  populations, in order to control resource areas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The relationship she describes there isn’t one in which purchasing an
 Apple product is “akin” to committing rape, but one in which purchasing
 material something built with “conflict minerals” makes one complicit 
in the brutal tactics of the regimes who mine them. The difference 
between Crowder’s summary and Judd’s actual statement couldn’t be more 
stark: he thinks she equates all evils with “rape,” you know, like 
liberals do; whereas she’s specifically identifying how rape is used in a
 particular cultural context to “convince” people to work for 
slave-wages.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that Judd hasn’t made outlandish statements in the past, but this strikes me as Crowder doing what <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/03/john-noltes-outraged-on-behalf-of-topless-women-everywhere.html">John Nolte and Jeff Goldstein</a>
 and every other anti-political correctness crusader loves to do: 
telling jokes that white men are forbidden to tell by the dark and 
womanly multicultural establishment. Because it’s just as bleeding edge 
now <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7S5BP-tvR8">as it was in ’77</a>.</p>

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2013/03/of-course-obama-is-satan.html"><span><strong>Of course Obama is Satan</strong> Whether you believe that Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni, the man portraying Satan in the Hitler Channel’s adaptation of The Bible, looks like President Obama depends on a number of factors, foremost among them your familiarity with people of other races. If, like many white conservatives, the majority of your interaction with people darker than you occurs when you watch the evening news, you see this image and are shocked by the similarity: Just look at his skin! The deep set eyes! The wide nose! His ears aren’t visible but surely they’re identical too! Except they aren’t. This is why I force my students to pay very close attention to the actual frames they’re analyzing instead of relying on an uncritical sense of what’s being represented on screen. To wit: I chose this comparison because it’s the one in which the likeness, such as it is, seems greatest. It’s important to note that it’s from the conservative Newsbusters site, meaning that it’s been selected in order to heighten the featural similarities between them. The President’s lips aren’t always pursed, and choosing an image in which they are creates some features that wouldn’t otherwise be there, but for argument’s sake I’ll pretend this is how the President always looks. We’ll start our comparison with the forehead: not only is Ouazanni’s deeply furrowed, the muscles above his eyebrows are far more defined. Moving down to the glabella — the bit between the eyebrows — Ouazanni’s contains both vertical and horizontal furrows, whereas the President’s is smooth. Both have deep-set eyes, but Ouazanni’s are hooded and appear almost rectangular, whereas the President’s are almond-shaped. Beneath both of their eyes is a pronounced lower eyelid furrow which combines with an intraorbital furrow to create downward facing triangles on their cheeks. In this image, they both also have well-defined nasolabial furrows descending from the tips of their nostril wings out and around their lips to their chins, both of which are squarish. There are significant differences: Ouazanni’s cheeks are sunken, whereas the President’s are puffed; the shape and presentation angle of their nostrils is completely different, etc. In other words, a simple description of the features of their face makes it possible to believe that they look somewhat similar — or that, as many on the right are arguing, Ouazanni looks like an older version the President. Except they don’t. The number of specific features a viewer needs to overlook — or be race-blind to — in order to claim a holistic similarity between the two is just too high.* If you want to see a connection, enough featural similarities exist for you to do so, but only if you make a conscious decision to equate an image of Satan in a hoodie with the President. The number of distinctions you must overlook is equaled by the number your cross-racial identification bias prevents you from seeing. Factor in whatever intuitive model of aging you use to crease the President’s forehead and wrinkle his cheeks and it’s clear...</span></a></div>
