        <meta name="description" content="JOHN CORNYN (R): Do you believe that judges ever change the law? [Let me clarify: I don't think they should when people like you are on the bench.] JOHN CORNYN (R): You wrote that the law judges declare is not, quote, “a definitive capital-L Law that would many would like to think exists,” and, quote, “that the public fails to appreciate the importance of indefiniteness in the law.” Can you explain those statements? [The Law is like the Bible: it has always said what I say it said the moment I say it said it.] JOHN CORNYN (R): In a 2001 speech at Berkeley, you wrote that “whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences . . . our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging.” The difference is physiological if it relates to the mechanical, physical, or biochemical functions of the body, as I understand the word. What do you mean by that? [I'm a convenient egalitarian and I'm going to pretend your statement applies to judges on the bench instead of whether we ought to let blind people be fighter pilots .] JOHN CORNYN (R): We’re not talking about pilots.

Are you fucking illiterate?] JOHN CORNYN (R): I’m struggling a little bit to understand how your statement about physiological differences could affect the outcome or affect judging and your stated commitment to fidelity to the law as being your sole standard and how any litigant can know where that will end. But let me ask you on another topic. [Fine. If you don't like that trap, I have others.] JOHN CORNYN (R): There was a Washington Post story that said, “The White House scrambled yesterday to assuage worries from liberal groups about Judge Sonia Sotomayor’s scant record on abortion rights.” It goes on to say, “the White House press secretary said the president did not ask Sotomayor specifically about abortion rights during their interview.” If that’s the case, on what basis would White House officials subsequently send a message that abortion rights groups do not need to worry about how you might rule in a challenge to Roe v. Wade? [How exactly would the mainstream liberals in the White House know what a mainstream liberal like yourself believes?] JEFFERSON BEAUREGARD SESSIONS, III (R): I would offer a letter for the record from the National Rifle Association in which they express serious concern about the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor.

			<p><strong>JOHN CORNYN (R):</strong> Do you believe that judges ever change the law?
</p><blockquote><p>[<em>Let me clarify: I don&#39;t think they should when people like you are on the bench.</em>] </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JOHN CORNYN (R):</strong> You wrote that the law judges declare is not, quote, “a definitive capital-<em>L</em>
Law that would many would like to think exists,” and, quote, “that the
public fails to appreciate the importance of indefiniteness in the
law.” Can you explain those statements?</p>

<p><span id="more-10151"></span></p>
<p><strong>JOHN CORNYN (R):</strong> In a 2001 speech at Berkeley, you wrote that
“whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural
differences . . . our gender and national origins may and will make a
difference in our judging.” The difference is physiological if it
relates to the mechanical, physical, or biochemical functions of the
body, as I understand the word. What do you mean by that?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>I&#39;m a convenient egalitarian and I&#39;m going to
pretend your statement applies to judges on the bench instead of
whether we ought to let blind people be fighter pilots .</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JOHN CORNYN (R):</strong> We’re not talking about pilots.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Enough with the pilots already. If you don&#39;t stop
addressing the substance of your argument, I won&#39;t be able to trick you
into saying you believe ridiculous things.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JOHN CORNYN (R):</strong> So you stand by the comment or the statement that inherent physiological differences will make a difference in judging?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Why won&#39;t you walk into my trap? It says it right there: <strong>THIS IS A TRAP.</strong> Are you fucking illiterate?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JOHN CORNYN (R):</strong> I’m struggling a little bit to understand
how your statement about physiological differences could affect the
outcome or affect judging and your stated commitment to fidelity to the
law as being your sole standard and how any litigant can know where
that will end. But let me ask you on another topic.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Fine. If you don&#39;t like that trap, I have others.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JOHN CORNYN (R):</strong> There was a Washington Post story that said,
“The White House scrambled yesterday to assuage worries from liberal
groups about Judge Sonia Sotomayor’s scant record on abortion rights.”
It goes on to say, “the White House press secretary said the president
did not ask Sotomayor specifically about abortion rights during their
interview.” If that’s the case, on what basis would White House
officials subsequently send a message that abortion rights groups do
not need to worry about how you might rule in a challenge to Roe v.
Wade?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>How exactly would the mainstream liberals in the White House know what a mainstream liberal like yourself believes?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JEFFERSON BEAUREGARD SESSIONS, III (R):</strong> I would offer a
letter for the record from the National Rifle Association in which they
express serious concern about the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor.
I would also offer for the record a letter from Mr. Richard Land, the
Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist
Convention, also raising concerns.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>That&#39;ll teach them to say that conservatives cling bitterly to God and guns.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>TOM COBURN (R):</strong> I want to begin here today by looking at your
cases in an area that is very important to many of us, and that’s the
Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Although we are very much about guns.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>TOM COBURN (R):</strong> What is the definition of death?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>. . . and killing things.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>TOM COBURN (R):</strong> If we now have viability at 21 weeks, why
would that not be something that should be considered as we look at the
status of what can and cannot happen, in terms of this right to privacy
that’s been granted under Roe v. Wade in cases?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>. . . except when those things haven&#39;t been born.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>TOM COBURN (R):</strong> So I sit in Oklahoma in my home, and what we
have today as law in the land, as you see it, is that I do not have a
fundamental incorporated right to bear arms, as you see the law today?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>. . . and also guns.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>ORRIN HATCH (R):</strong> You have described your judicial philosophy
in terms of the phrase “fidelity to the law.” Would you agree with me
that both majority and dissenting justices in last year’s gun rights
decision in District of Columbia v. Heller were doing their best to be
faithful to the text and history of the Second Amendment?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>I think Senator Coburn neglected to mention that we are all about guns.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>ORRIN HATCH (R):</strong> So let me ask you just about a few abortion cases in which the [Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund] filed briefs.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>. . . and things that haven&#39;t been born. </em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong> When you look at the fundamental right
aspect of the Second Amendment, you’ll be looking at precedent, you
will be looking in our history, you will be looking at a lot of things.
Hopefully, you’ve talked to your godchild, who’s an NRA member. You can
be — you can assimilate your view of what America is all about when it
comes to Second Amendment.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>. . . and also guns.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong>We’ve talked a lot about the Second Amendment.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>But not nearly enough to my liking.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong> Is there any personal judgment to be
relied upon by a Supreme Court justice in deciding whether or not the
2nd Amendment is a fundamental right?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>So how about another go-round about guns?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong> I have nothing but great admiration and
respect for those men and women who serve in our Judge Advocate Corps
who will be given the obligation by our nation to render justice
against people like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. And I just want to say
this, also, on this historic day. To those who wonder why we do this,
why do we give him a trial? Why are we so concerned about him having
his day in court? Why do we give him a lawyer when we know what he
would do to our people in his hands?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Fine. If you dn&#39;t want to talk about guns, we can
always talk about people I want to shoot. Why should people I want to
shoot get fair trials?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong> And I want the world to understand that
America is not a bad place because we will hold Al Qaida members under
a process that is fair, transparent until they die.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Because it&#39;s not like we ever <strong>actually</strong> get to shoot them. Why isn&#39;t the world proud of us for not giving into temptation and shooting the lot of them?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong> Do you embrace identity politics personally?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>So long as we&#39;re talking about brown people . . . </em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong> Do you believe that your speeches properly read embrace identity politics?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>. . . because I think they do.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong> And you have said some things that just bugged the hell out of me.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>They just bugged the hell out of me.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong> I think and believe, based on what I know
about you so far, that you’re broad-minded enough to understand that
America is bigger than the Bronx, it’s bigger than South Carolina.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>But it&#39;s a lot more like South Carolina than the Bronx.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong> The last question on the “wise Latina woman” comment.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Unless we all have our fingers crossed.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong> I hope you understand the difference
between petitioning one’s government and having a say in the electoral
process, and voting for people that if you don’t like you can get rid
of, and the difference of society being changed by nine unelected
people who have a lifetime appointment. Do you understand the
difference in how those two systems work?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>I don&#39;t want to sound insulting, but have you ever taken a high school civics class?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong> The bottom line is, one of the problems
the court has now is that Mr. Ricci has a story to tell, too. There are
all kinds of stories to tell in this country, and the court has, in the
opinion of many of us, gone into the business of societal change not
based on the plain language of the Constitution, but based on
motivations that can never be checked at the ballot box.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Because I plainly haven&#39;t, as you can tell by the
fact that I think the Constitution is written in language as plain as
the King James Bible.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM (R):</strong> Some states have different age limits for marriage. Some states treat marriage differently than others.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Which is that book that stars Jesus as God and is all about how much they both hate the gays.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JOHN CORNYN (R):</strong> The test is really, what kind of justice
will you be if confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States?
Will you be one that adheres to a written Constitution and written laws
and respects the right of the people to make their laws through their
elected representatives, or will you pursue some other agenda,
personal, political, ideological, that is something other than
enforcing the law?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>This is all completely hypothetical. I&#39;m not talking about the gays here.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JOHN CORNYN (R):</strong> What should I tell my constituents who are
watching these hearings and saying to themselves, “In Berkeley and
other places around the country, she says one thing, but at these
hearings, you are saying something which sounds contradictory, if not
diametrically opposed, to some of the things you’ve said in speeches
around the country”?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Because everyone knows the gays live in San
Fransisco, not Berkeley. Which raises an interesting question: are now,
or have you ever been, a hippie?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JOHN CORNYN (R):</strong> If the Supreme Court in the next few years
holds that there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, would
that be making the law? Or would that be interpreting the law?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>What I said about this not being about the gays? I
lied. But only a little, as I now want to impugn the character of the
guy who nominated you.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JOHN CORNYN (R):</strong> Judge Sotomayor, what is the difference, to your mind, between a political contribution and a bribe?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>I ask this disinterestedly, as someone who has never accepted a political contribution in his life: to whom is Obama beholden?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JOHN CORNYN (R):</strong> Last year, President Obama set a record in
fundraising from private sources, raising an unprecedented amount of
campaign contributions. Do you think . . . that President Obama can say
with credibility that he’s carrying out the mandate of a democratic
society?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>For the next two minutes, I will pretend that
contributing to a political campaign is an overt act of communism.
Judge Sotomayor, will you tear down that wall?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>CHARLES GRASSLEY (R):</strong> I believe that I’m going to ask you something you never been asked before during this hearing, I hope.</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em><strong>Finally</strong>.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>CHARLES GRASSLEY (R):</strong> Following what you said about certain
things being about precedent, I assume that you’ve answered a lot of
questions before this committee about, even after you said that certain
things are precedent, of things that are going to come before the court
down the road if you’re on the Supreme Court. You didn’t seem to
compromise or hedge on those things being precedent. Why are you
hedging on this?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>We should have a theoretical conversation about your oft-stated commitment to precedent.</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>CHARLES GRASSLEY (R):</strong> The issue of is it a federal question
or not a federal question. So do you agree that marriage is a question
reserved for the states to decide based on Baker v. Nelson?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<em>Don&#39;t you think that individual states ought to be able to decide whether or not they let their ga---what is your <strong>generic</strong> opinion about how the federal should handle who individual states let marry?</em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>TO BE CONCLUDED . . .</strong></p><p>(<em><a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/07/16/the-passion-of-the-sotomayor-part-ii/">x-posted</a></em>.)</p>

[I am committed to maintaining the appearance that I possess the minimum degree of competence and responsibility required by my office.] JON KYL (R): You’ve always been able to find a legal basis for every decision that you’ve rendered as a judge? [By which I mean: I'll read a few speeches a few times, but I can't be bothered to do the work necessary to actually acquire the minimum degree of competence and responsibility required by my office.] JON KYL (R): Issues which are similar is different, though, from an issue which is the same. [Just in case I didn't make myself absolutely clear: I don't possess the minimum degree of competence and responsibility required by my office.] LINDSEY GRAHAM (R): What does [legal realism] mean for someone who may be watching the hearing? [Have you done your homework?] LINDSEY GRAHAM (R): When Judge Rehnquist says he was a strict constructionist, did you know what he was talking about? [Because I don't think you've done your homework.] LINDSEY GRAHAM (R): What is an originalist? [Do you know what happens to naughty students who don't do their homework?] LINDSEY GRAHAM (R): Do you believe the Constitution is a living, breathing, evolving document? [They get asked loaded questions designed to appeal to the teacher's constituents, that's what.] LINDSEY GRAHAM (R): Do you think Roe v. Wade changed American society? [Just in case you thought I was kidding about those loaded questions.] LINDSEY GRAHAM (R): Is there anything in the Constitution that says a state legislator or the Congress cannot regulate abortion or the definition of life in the first trimester? [Because I wasn't.] LINDSEY GRAHAM (R): I like you, by the way, for whatever that matters. Since I may vote for you that ought to matter to you. One thing that stood out about your record is that when you look at the almanac of the federal judiciary, lawyers anonymously rate judges in terms of temperament. And here’s what they said about you. She’s a terror on the bench. She’s temperamental, excitable, she seems angry. She’s overall aggressive, not very judicial. She does not have a very good temperament. She abuses lawyers. She really lacks judicial temperament. [Everyone knows you're a bitch, but I'll refrain from agreeing with them for a few more questions to keep up the appearance of impartiality.] LINDSEY GRAHAM (R): Are you the only one that asks tough questions in oral arguments? [Exactly how long have you been such a bitch?] LINDSEY GRAHAM (R): Let’s talk about the wise Latino comment, yet again. [Now is you is, or is you ain't, my constituency?] LINDSEY GRAHAM (R): I can’t find the quote, but I’ll find it here in a moment—the wise Latino quote. I’ve got it: “I would hope that a wise Latino [sic] woman, with the richness of her experience, would more often than not reach a...</span></a></div>
