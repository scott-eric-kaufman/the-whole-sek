        <meta name="description" content="[Cross-posted You-Know-Where.] A critic establishes trust with his or her readers by citational proxy. Who cites and is cited by whom means everything when evaluating contemporary criticism. So when I run across an article about Nella Larsen's Passing which cites seven works by Jacques Lacan, three by Freud, ten glosses of Lacan but only five citations from the rich critical history of Larsen's novel, I hardly need to read the article to know that I do not trust this critic's ability to evaluate his or her sources. (All that talk of gazing and yet so myopic. Sigh.) A critic who don't know merde from cirage à chaussures (that sounds so much snappier in English) cannot expect the majority of readers to consider the points he or she forwards with the seriousness befitting academic discourse . . . and by &quot;the majority of readers,&quot; I only mean &quot;all those who don't share the critic's supremely constricted set of assumptions.&quot; It is outright unnerving to read criticism in one of the profession's flagship journals which defiantly refuses to engage the critical history of a novel written about so freqently. Does this critic suggest that only four of the 642 articles and reviews available via Project Muse and JSTOR alone even obliquely address his or her argument? (Before you ask: only four of the five aforementioned articles could be found in a database because the other non-psychoanalytic entry was the introduction to the edition of Passing cited in the article.) One certainly does. The critic's citation of it begins: Judith Butler directly engages paranoia and Passing in terms of Freud’s analysis . . . Did I mention myopia? To put it another way: Q: What are the odds that this particular scholar would not have found Passing a cornucopia of psychoanalytic conundrums?[1] A: Zero. The odds of me trusting that this critic's reading of Larsen's novel dimish with every passing Lacan . . . . because the article is not about Larsen so much as it is a recitation of ontological talking points. Needless to say, while I would rather my criticism altogether empty of psychoanalytic position statements, due to recent interactions with intelligent people I have abandoned my hard-line snickering dismissiveness. I can now handle the occasional reference to psychoanalytic concepts with fruitive effects on the literary reading. (&quot;Leslie Fiedler!&quot; Luther Blisset said. &quot;Leslie Fiedler!&quot;) So yes . . . . Leslie Fiedler! But Fiedler's Freud appeared in the service of literary explication; his Freud did not function as the principle of selection behind the literature he analyzed. Selecting works which further flatter the assumptions you have committed your self and career to flattering does not incline your readers to trust you. Passing may exemplify some psychoanalytic hobby-horse, but the fact that Quicksand hardly merits mention leads this reader to believe that it fails whatever litmus test this critic applies to works before he writes about them . . . and that mode of scholarship seems outright Rovian. I feel comfortable saying..." />

<p>The intended point of this post involved glossing the appearance of Kenneth Deffeyes' <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809029561">Beyond Oil</a></em><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" /> in Michael Klare's article in the latest <a href="http://www.nplusonemag.com/toc3--newimage.html">n+1</a>.&nbsp; Normally I associate those who scream &quot;Peak Oil!&nbsp; Peak Oil!&quot; with scaremongering libertarians . . . but I trust Deffeyes' judgment implicitly because of the intellectual honesty he displayed in John McPhee's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=external-search%3Fsearch-type=ss%26keyword=annals%20of%20the%20former%20world%26index=books">Annals of the Former World</a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" /></em><span style="font-style: italic;">.&nbsp; </span> McPhee's book is riddled with statements by Deffeyes' like:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;You have to deal with partial information.&nbsp; In oil drilling, you had better be ready to act shrewdly on partial information.&nbsp; Do physicists do that?&nbsp; Hell, no.&nbsp; They want to have it to seven decimal places on their Hewlett-Packards.&nbsp; The geologist has to choose the course of action with the best statistical chance.&nbsp; As a result, the style of geology is full of inferences, and they change.&nbsp; No one has ever seen a geosyncline.&nbsp; No one has ever seen the welding of tuff.&nbsp; No one has ever seen a granite batholith intrude.&quot; (133)</p></blockquote><p>Deffeyes' intellectual flexibility—his determination to fit his theory to the facts and not the other way around—should be a model for humanistic inquiries as much as scientific.&nbsp; A theory should fit the facts it purports to explain; instead, the facts chosen for explication are chosen because they fit the theories the critic intended to flatter all along.&nbsp; This situation saddens me more than anything else.&nbsp; If my tone seems combative, understand that when I see such wanton manipulation I want to scream my cords raw and tendons bloody . . . to invent the next generation of sanguineous <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=parasynthetic">parasynthetics</a>.&nbsp; (I link that not to condescend but because I understand that not everyone shares my fascination with all things dictionary.)</p>



<p><a name="1">[1]</a> Quick note about the word &quot;conundrum.&quot;&nbsp; Apparently the plural is &quot;conundrums&quot; instead of &quot;conundra&quot; because it is a nonce-word, a linguistic relic of some Oxford prank from the 1580s.&nbsp; The fact that it retains English pluralization despite being a parodic Latin term astonishes me.&nbsp; You would think that by now someone would have inflected it in accordance with Latin grammar.<br /> </p>

Like today I sat down and thought how wonderful it would be to think about adjectives this afternoon. What does prose look like with them? What does it look like without them? Why do we gender the relative distribution of adjectives? Why do too many make sentences sound &quot;feminine&quot; and not enough make sentences sound &quot;masculine&quot;? What is it about precision that reflects upon our respective genitalia? Then I sit. You may wonder why I specify that since I have probably been sitting the entire time. Which I have. So I add in the interest of wily womanish precision that &quot;Then I continue to sit.&quot; Because I could have stood up and paced. I could have waved my arms—I could be waving them right now—instead I continue my sedent defiance of motion. So I say to you again as I have said that I am and have been seated for some time as I compose this post. So I sit thinking about adjectival precision and external organs of generation and wondering whether the audience I imagine into existence nightly will think a post about gender and exactness worthy of wasting 13 minutes reading. But the point is that I sit. Sitting is important. Only if you sit can you learn anything about yourself. Could Gertrude Stein have composed the following standing up or astride some beast of locomotion? Identity is funny being yourself is funny as you are never yourself to yourself except as you remember yourself and then of course you do not believe yourself . . . . you do not really believe yourself why should you, you know so well so very well that it is not yourself, it could not be yourself because you cannot remember right and if you do remember right it does not sound right and of course it does not sound right because it is not right. You are of course never yourself. No I do not think she could why do you think she could because she could not have. Reading Gertrude Stein may be hazardous to your prose or if not hazardous then a hazard which you would avoid if you could avoid but you cannot avoid because you cannot. See what I mean? So you sit there to compose your post instead of moving around to move around like the way Darwin designed people to and then you write down what you think about precision and penises and vaginas. In an act of pure puerility you consider what you could say about the plural of the noun &quot;penis.&quot; &quot;What is the plural of 'penis'?&quot; you could ask and then you could say that while investigating this most mysterious mystery you tripped over the word &quot;penintime&quot; with all the grace of a shitface and momentarily thought...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/the_buck_stops_.html"><span><strong>The Buck Stops . . . Over There, You Know, Way, Way Over There</strong> Written on the baggy in which a manuscript from overseas arrived: ATTENTION: POSTMASTER PLEASE FORWARD THIS ARTICLE TO THE ADDRESSEE. DEAR POSTAL CUSTOMER: The enclosed was found loose in the mails or has been damaged in handling prior to arrival in the Postal Service (whichever is applicable to the enclosure). We realize mail is important to you and you have every right to expect it to be delivered intact and in good condition. The Postal Service makes every effort to properly handle the mail entrusted to it but occasional damage may occur prior to its handling by the Postal Service. When the Post Office handles in excess of eighteen million pieces of mail daily, it is imperative . . . . . . blah blah blah blame the Royal Mail blah blah blah we try hard but this isn't our fault blah blah blah. I could add that ever since our zipcode changed last summer, it has taken Netflix films three days to arrive instead of one; that I consistently receive bills the day before or the very day they're due; or that anytime anyone sends me anyhing and I thank them for it their response is &quot;It took that long to get there?&quot; I could say that, but then I remember that episode of Seinfeld and think better of it. Were I to mock said baggy-speak, I'd say stuff like &quot;Magnificent passing of the buck, my good man!&quot; and &quot;We realize that mail is important to you&quot;? I'd answer the latter with stuff like &quot;Yes! So is my credit rating!&quot; But that's only if I were to answer. Which I refuse to do. On principle. Because mail is important to me . . .</span></a></div>
