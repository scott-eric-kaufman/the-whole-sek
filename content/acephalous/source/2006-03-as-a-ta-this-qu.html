		<span id="comment-14858539-content"><p>Until they paternalistically shut down the internet access in our classrooms, we law students shopped online, paid our bills, checked our email and chatted on IM during lecture.  Sometimes it was very useful, like if you were suddenly called on, and didn&#39;t know the answer, you could stall by saying &quot;Um,&quot; and 5 of your class buddies would IM you the answer. Other times, it was obviously not class related, and you had to stifle your laughter. I have found that feigning a sneeze, followed by a coughing fit works.</p>

<p>I have to admit, I paid better attention after the cut the internet, but I still say that if we adults want to waste our $20,000/year education by checking our email (and hey, sometimes we used it for academic reasons)--well, we should be allowed to!  Besdies, after they cut the internet, the crazy notetakers (me) kept on taking notes like they always did, and the time-wasters switched from online Poker to Spider Solitaire.  Nothing ever changes.</p>

<p>But the fake coughing fit works.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-14859737-content"><p>I wondered what the laughing was all about.  I felt it directed towards someone sitting in the vicinity of me.  For a moment I thought people were laughing at me (it&#39;s a notion I indulge in that could either be interpreted as egomaniacal or indicative of a serious emotional disorder) due to one of the increasingly whiny comments I was making that seemed to engage the girl behind me (&quot;I disagree!&quot;), who I responded to telepathically (&quot;Whatever&quot;). </p>

<p>There&#39;s a girl in my Crit. class who takes no notes, has ipod earphones discreetly in, and is obsessed with browsing some sort of Bob Dylan fanclub site.  There&#39;s a guy in LJ101A who will not cease from reading the contents of a Honda Sportscar networking page.  In French, a guy next to me is chatting on AOL messenger the entire class; his screen name is BiBlackJohn23 if anyone&#39;s interested.   </p>

<p>The image of a wizard on a pony (preferably wearing a conehat supplanting bonnet) is something I will cherish, thank you.<br />

<p>Zach, Sorry about making you think I was laughing at you.  The student in question sits behind you and to your right, and she&#39;s a regular contributor to the class.  In fact, she raised her arm so violently to defend Junger today I thought she would&#39;ve snapped her elbow in two.  (And for future readers, this student in question is a bright, articulate student who simply got BUSTED! today.  Also, since she&#39;s one of &quot;my&quot; kids, she wouldn&#39;t mind this anonymous ribbing.  And Zach, I should note that one of the reasons you thought I was looking at you when I couldn&#39;t keep my composure is because I was, since if I looked behind you she&#39;d start laughing again, then I&#39;d start laughing again, then everyone would look at me and try to discern why I was laughing . . . but as for the <i>Holy Grail</i> thing, I&#39;m fairly certain no one else caught that, but it certainly cracked Barry up.</p>

<p>To everyone else, as if it even needs saying: not only was the class discussion one of best I&#39;ve ever seen in a lecture that large, but it was also the single most entertaining teaching experience I&#39;ve ever had.  I <i>barely</i> kept it together today.  <i>Barely</i>.  </p>

<p>Were I a truck, the hilarity of today&#39;s class was of <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/geological_weir.html" rel="nofollow">a steepness, I judge, that would have caused the vehicle, had it slipped off the road, to go end over end enveloped in flame at a hundred yards a bounce</a>.  It was <i>that</i> awesome.</p></span>

All the kids who jumped all over Junger in the reading responses finally came out to play--even after our esteemed Pulitzer Prize-winning professor made it clear what his opinion was.  And I thought you were laughing at me.  Ok, maybe not.  Anyway, she was playing solitaire not reading her email.  But, I didn&#39;t watch her the whole time, so maybe she was.  I&#39;m sure she won&#39;t mind if we kid her a little.  She is a bright one.  I want to be like her when I grow up.  And Zach too.</p></span>

That email was an awesome move.<br />
I get so distracted when someone&#39;s on their computer next to me, then I inevitably eavesdrop- for instance I know that Zach gets way to much spam and that the U2 tour is cancelled, but Madonna&#39;s in top form. <br />
I don&#39;t bring my lap top.  Instead I distract myself the old fashioned way, doodling and passing notes.  My last note today:  Scott &amp;hearts s McPhee.<br />

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/the_advisor_sen.html"><span><strong>Legitimately Freudianesque; or, Sometimes A Wolfe Is Just Your Mother</strong> The advisor sends me an email saying I should &quot;respond&quot; to this article. It contains the words &quot;species&quot; and &quot;race&quot; in the title and thus falls squarely within the purview of the chapter I'll be working on when I finish the current one. As I begin reading it I realize I don't know what the word &quot;respond&quot; really means. Does he want me to consider it seriously? Employ it as foil? Long years have led me to believe that I've been requested to rehearse the strong form of Cary Wolfe's argument on the local level and &quot;respond&quot; to it on the global. I should construct an uber-un-strawman and address it. Only &quot;address&quot; no more informs me of how I'm supposed to react to this article than &quot;respond.&quot; Because Wolfe rebukes particular psychoanalytic arguments in predictably psychoanalytic ways, my initial response consisted of pure revulsion. The whole way in which any psychoanalytically-informed critic incorporates all anti-psychoanalytic thought back into a psychoanalytic framework disgusts me. By defining one's work as &quot;anti-psychoanalytic&quot; one begs to be re-incorporated, I understand that. But oftentimes the anti-psychoanalytic lable is applied by the psychoanalytic critic and not the non-psychoanalytic author. But I digress. My larger issue with the article is that it lack stakes. Such stakelesness points to my core objection to what Hoblo calls &quot;Higher Eclectism.&quot; It's merely descriptive. It articulates a personal opinion in a philosophical language without any concern for the implications of such juxtapositions. So when Wolfe reduces 250 years of complex thought on the process of speciation into a human/other binary I simply want to spit. I understand that Wolfe creates that binary only to tear it down—but that's exactly what I mean by &quot;stakelessness.&quot; Instead of rummaging through the archives and reading the actual debates on the human/animal distinction, Wolfe invents an anthropology. He's certainly correct to note that, among the laity, the assumption of human superioty reigned supreme long after special creation had been scientifically debunked. But wouldn't it be appropriate to establish that in the essay? Why the faux universalism which refuses to acknowledge the existence and contemporaneity of these debates? I understand that Wolfe claims these debates are ongoing—but why then does he remain firmly in the theoretical tradition? Would it not be enriched by homologous debates in the history and philosophy of science? Note that I'm not accusing him of redefining another discipline's problems in the language of his own. I see no evidence of meta-plagiarism. I do see evidence of arrogance. Of self-satisfaction in the superiority of his theoretical knowledge. Of a desire to enshrine the contingent in the pantheon of the universal. What annoys me is that the dynamic—a combination of Freudianism and relation to the category of the animal—he identifies at work in Hemingway seems fundamentally sound. I only wish it were identified as being the product of a particular historical moment in which everyone was Freudianesque.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/don_delillo_scr.html"><span><strong>Don Delillo, Screenwriter!?! Or: Do Not Defile Game 6</strong> [X-posted to The Valve .] Just yesterday I told someone that I'd never write about baseball because then I'd never write about anything else . . . and yet here I am today writing about baseball. The occasion? Don Delillo wants to despoil one of the highlights of my childhood: Game 6. As many of you know, I loathe Don Delillo. I loathe him as much as I love Game Six. The real one, not the recently released film Delillo penned. (I could write about Mookie Wilson's slow dribbler and the error which from that day forward defined Bill Buckner's life; instead I'll note in passing that no one deserves to spend the rest of his life autographing photographs of the mistake which defines it. Not even a member of the '86 Red Sox.) Since people already know that my central complaint about Delillo (and others) is singular, signature narrative voice, I won't re-rehearse that argument here. I will wonder why, given Delillo's heteroglossical limitations, someone decided to let him play screenwriter. (For more on a related topic, see Laura's excellent post below.) I can think of few roles for which a writer with Delillo's weaknesses is less suited: sitcom writer, for one; a foil for Larry David , for another. The list is remarkably short. Or is it?</span></a></div>
