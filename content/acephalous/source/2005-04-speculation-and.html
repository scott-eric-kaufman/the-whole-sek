Alexander now became a proficient skater, an art in which as a young man he excelled...the boy and his mother spent many happy hours, while she sat in one of the high-backed sleds of that region, which he skillfully guided through the gay crowd of all ages who glided gracefully over the ice. (45) Dobbs feels sufficiently strongly about the constitution of young Alexander Agassiz that he sees no problem casting doubt on his mother's account (admittedly learned second-hand) of that &quot;especially happy&quot; winter.

<p>Where's that line?&nbsp; At what point does one earn the right to engage in this sort of speculation? </p>

<p>I ask, in part, because of the concerns <a href="http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the_little_professor/2005/03/open_the_valve.html">the Little Professor</a> often raises about being mistaken for a historian.&nbsp; As a literary scholar, I've learned to read literary works in a particular way (lots of them actually) in which I have license to interpret them, well, pretty much as I please.&nbsp; But as a historicist, if not historian, I often wonder whether I'm not reading historical works as a literary critic and thus commiting sins more grevious than those for which I (mildly) scold Dobbs.</p>

<p>That said, I'll present some of <em>Reef Madness' </em>highlights:</p>

<ul><li>Henry David Thoreau gave Louis Agassiz a bear.&nbsp; It didn't work out. &quot;Presumably a symbol of nature's noble symplicity, the bear simplified nothing, though it did offer unpredictable entertainment, as when during a dinner party is slipped its chains in the basement, raided the wine cask, and stumbled upstairs...&quot; (56).</li>

<li>When Agassiz married Anna Russell &quot;he made himself brother-in-law to his best friend; brother-in-law to his wife's (and his) new uncle; brother-in-law to his best friend's wife (Mimi); and, naturally, a cousin to himself a couple times over and at least once removed&quot; (65).&nbsp; This may only interest me because of certain, well, &quot;connections&quot; with Mississippi.</li>

<li>Dobbs' description of the initial debate between an empirical evolutionism and a creationist idealism is priceless, but in absolutely no way appropos to anything anyone I know must confront daily.&nbsp; Comparing creationist elaborations to the fanciful evolutionary schema of <em>The Vestiges </em>(whose theories of &quot;monstrous births&quot; I've written about elsewhere), Dobbs writes &quot;both made the same sort of unfounded conceptual jump--exciting but unsupportable--that left one standing on air.&nbsp; As [Asa Gray] put it to Hooker in 1858, '[I] sympathize more with &amp; estimate higher the slow induction that leads step by step to sound conclusions so far as they go, than the bolder flights of genius which so often leads teh possessor to mount three pairs of steps only to jump out of the garret window'&quot; (81).</li></ul>

<p>But you are a literary critic, right? So isn&#39;t it ok to read as one? I&#39;m not saying become a Marxist like some assholes I could name, but maybe you should cut yourself some slack. Just a thought.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/04/queering_turner.html"><span><strong>Queering Turner Field?</strong> So there I sat, on the couch, watching the Braves slaughter the hapless Mets with one eye and reading David Dobb's Reef Madness with the other, when I see Jose Reyes foul a ball off into the stands. For those of you unfamiliar with the conventions of baseball telecasts, after a ball is fouled off the camera sometimes follows the ball into the stands, finds the person that caught it and zooms in him or her. As often as not, the foul ball's caught by a young man accompanied by a young woman; and often as not, the young man's reward for shagging the ball is an enthusiastic, energetic kiss--both the young man and the young woman hopping at this point--from the young woman whose life he saved with a timely shag. Turner Field, the home of the Atlanta Braves, sits outside the city proper. Braves fans are notoriously rural--famously supporting John Rocker after his diatribe on the purple-haried queers with AIDS who comprise the entirety of the Metropolitan Transit Authority's communter population--so when the camera followed the Jose Reyes foul ball into the stands and captured two men engaged in ritual post-ball-shagging osculation, I could hear the clinking of millions of Pabst Blue Ribbon cans hitting the floor from all the way out here... ...on another, more scholarly note, the following query came across H-Net's American Studies listserv this morning: Can list members suggest ways to introduce the topic of sexual orientation into a pre-Civil War American literature survey? Let me translate that for you: I want to engender a discussion about a historical period but I don't know any works in that historical period that will allow me to introduce the only subject I'd like to address, so could some of you people who know the primary works in the period I've been hired by my university to teach tell me which ones I can queer so I don't have to stop reading Judith Butler to do something unimportant like gain expertise in the field in which I have a Ph.D.? Sometimes rampant unprofessionalism amuses me; sometimes it disgusts me; sometimes it leaves me numb. Cross your fingers and wish me the last tonight.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/04/the_caverat_is_.html"><span><strong>The Cave-rat is an American Form</strong> Were I to rename this corner of the internet, I'd undoubtedly name it &quot;The Eye of the Tucotuco.&quot; The name resonates, as does the sentence which would float below it in the unlikely event of a rechristening: He does not know the eye of the Tucotuco was carefully dissected. That's from Darwin's letter to Lyell, 3 October 1860.</span></a></div>
