		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef012875da5b74970c-content"><p>Fun!  That&#39;s what Darleen and company are having at my expense.  <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15553#comment-819207" rel="nofollow">Darleen</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Scott EEEEK has decided to start libeling me ... My, you are a coward aren’t you Scott?</blockquote>

<p>Note that she posts that not over here, where I&#39;ll see it, but over there, where I don&#39;t comment.  How brave of her, to attack me where she knows I won&#39;t respond!  (Lest you think me a hypocrite for posting this over here: I&#39;m not calling Darleen a coward.  An entitled idiot, certainly, but not a coward.)</p>

<p>This <a href="http://drunkardspath.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">clown</a> then <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15553#comment-819214" rel="nofollow">follows</a>:</p>

<blockquote>I really wonder how many black people are in SEK’s neighborhood.  Or his department.

<p>Certainly his alma mater isn’t going to win any prizes in that respect.</p>

<p>So, SEK: why DID you choose a school that has only 2% African Americans?</p>

<p>You sound an awful lot like Willie and Caricature, frankly. You’re all about DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE OPPRESSION OF BLACK PEOPLE.</p>

<p>Just as long as they’re not in your neighborhood, or on your campus, right? There ARE limits, after all.</blockquote></p>

<p>First, in one of those performances that undermines itself, this comment immediately jumps to talking about black people, whereas my post was about <em>non-white</em> people.  That makes his point about UCI skew stupid, because <em>according to his own link</em>, my alma mater is 75.5 percent non-white.  </p>

<p>Second, as to where I live, they <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15553#comment-819219" rel="nofollow">get to that</a>:</p>

<blockquote>I wonder if SEK, Caric, Willie et all even know any actual black people.

<p>SEK’s Twitter profile says he lives in Corona, which has a median household income of $98,615.</p>

<p>Damn, that sure sounds like Compton to me, how about you?</p>

<p>It also has a 100% Republican representation at both the state and federal level.</p>

<p>Odd that such a staunch proponent of diversity would choose to live there.</p>

<p>Nothing available in Inglewood, SEK? How about Watts?</p>

<p>Dumbass.</blockquote></p>

<p>Note that they access my super-secret Twitter profile, then wonder aloud whether I even know any black people <em>without it occuring to them to look at who I follow and who follows me</em>.  They have the answer to their question right in front of their face, and yet they insist on remaining in the hypothetical.</p>

<p>Now, as to where I live: I do, in fact, live in Corona, which does, in fact, have a median household income of $98,615.  Note, however, that this racist <em>automatically assumes</em> that this means there aren&#39;t any black people in my neighborhood.  Because, as we all know, black people don&#39;t earn three-figure salaries.  Moreover, notice how utterly bankrupt of reason this line of attack is: </p>

<p>Why do I teach where I teach?  Because that&#39;s the school where I was accepted and which continue to employ me.  </p>

<p>Why do I live where I live?  Because this is the closest I can live to Irvine and afford to pay the rent.  </p>

<p>Who do I live next to?  A black family across the way, and a Mexican family and a Pakistani couple upstairs.  My closest friend in the complex isn&#39;t just black, <em>he&#39;s also gay</em>!  </p>

<p>But because the median income (which is a little more than twice my salary) is so high, I must be afraid to live by the people I live by and associate with the people with whom I associate.  The stupidity continues with Darleen:</p>

<blockquote>Geez, SBP, that 2% in the school is higher than the 1.25% in the surrounding city of Irvine.

<p>The city I live in is 6.5% Black, 26% Latino. The city where I work is 57% Latino and 19% Black. At work I am in the minority.</p>

<p>I actually live what Squeeker [that&#39;s what the honest-to-god adults call me over there] only demogogues about.</blockquote></p>

<p>First, notice Darleen&#39;s got &quot;black&quot; and &quot;non-white&quot; confused again.  Palin doesn&#39;t, I claim, <em>appeal to non-white people</em>.  Even more stupid, though, is the high horse she climbs on because <em>the city</em> in which she works is 57 percent Latino and 19 percent black.  She&#39;s not talking about where she works, because if she did, she thought I would counter by saying that at the place where I&#39;m employed, 75.5 percent of the students are non-white.  No, wait, she likely didn&#39;t think that at all, because no one who actually thinks would start spouting out random numbers in an effort to prove that they&#39;re &quot;street&quot; to random strangers on the internet.</p>

<p>They then proceed to tell me <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15553#comment-819222" rel="nofollow">where I should live</a>:</p>

<blockquote>I really think he should be living in Inglewood, the “the sixth-most-liberal city in the United States, after Oakland, California, and just ahead of Newark, New Jersey” (both of which are earthly paradises, as we all know).

<p>Fucking hypocrite.</blockquote></p>

<p>So, for the record, according to Darleen and her clowns, you&#39;re a hypocritical racist if you note that Sarah Palin has no appeal to non-whites and don&#39;t live in Newark, but you&#39;re not a racist if you&#39;re unable to distinguish between non-white people and assume they&#39;re all black.  Also, you&#39;re not a hypocrite if you think <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15553#comment-819225" rel="nofollow">this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>It’s not enough to be told what to think, Darleen, or even to be told what you think. You needa be told how to live as the consequence.   SQEK can help.</blockquote>

<p><em>After having told me where to live</em>.  You&#39;re also not an idiot for claiming, as Darleen <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15553#comment-819234" rel="nofollow">does</a>, that I live in a lily-white wonderland, but that</p>

<blockquote>By virtue of living in So Cal, I live by and work with many Latinos.</blockquote>

<p><em>Even though she already established that I live in Southern California</em>.  You see, her living here gives her racial credibility, but my living here deprives me of any.  Glad to see that&#39;s settled. </p></span>

<p>For those too dumb to have noticed---no one who comments <em>here</em>, obviously---that was me <em>mocking</em> the conservative trope that no one whose best friend is X can be anti-X.  Know how you can tell?  Because I never use exclamation points earnestly, only when I want to mock someone.  Like myself!  In the comment before the one I linked to!  See it!  </p></span>

<p>Because it&#39;s impolite to condescend to children, I&#39;ll refrain from pointing out that I argued nothing of the sort---that my argument wasn&#39;t about those who <em>attended</em> the event, but about the photographs Sarah Palin chose to represent her constituency and what that suggests about the kind of campaign she&#39;s likely to run, and about the stupidity of those who do the reverse-racist tango any time anyone mentions the whiteness of the audiences Palin attracts.  Were Darleen a little brighter, she&#39;d understand that while that may describe <em>her</em>, it doesn&#39;t describe the vast majority of people who show up at Palin appearances. </p>

<p>Were she a little braver, she&#39;d respond over here.  Now that I think about it though, it&#39;s probably a blog thing: her place is so very, very white, whereas this one&#39;s dark cut through with yellow ...</p></span>

<blockquote>BTW, SEK: living in a neighborhood full of liberal academics doesn’t get you any street cred, no matter what range of color they happen to be.</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know why this clown thinks I live in &quot;a neighborhood full of liberal academics,&quot; but I don&#39;t.  One of my neighbors works for Gatorade, another is a mechanic, and I&#39;m not sure about the other, as I&#39;ve only met the wife because the husband works nights.  </p>

<blockquote>Yeah, like, whatever, dude (sorry to plagiarize your trademarked bullet-proof rebuttal there, SEK, but it seemed to fit).</blockquote>

<p>This clown also can&#39;t read.  I&#39;m not sure where he thinks I wrote that---maybe in invisible ink in between the bits above where I described his embarrassment of an argument?  Nope.  </p>

<blockquote>Face it, SEK: you’re a pasty white liberal who crosses the street if he sees a black person approaching. I’ve got you taped, my friend.</blockquote>

<p>This would be one of those people who prompted my earlier comment.  The fact that I have friends who are black, friends who are gay, and gay friends who are black <em>is immaterial to my argument</em>, hence the mockery.  I should&#39;ve known better, however, than to use sarcasm in the company of fools.  I&#39;ll not make that mistake again.*  That said, this clown has a tape of me crossing the street when a black person approaches, and if I&#39;m not mistaken, that black person&#39;s Michelle Obama and <a href="http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2008/10/15/michelle_obama/index.html" rel="nofollow">she&#39;s blaming &quot;Whitey&quot; for everything</a> ...</p>

<p>*I lie.  Sarcasm is my default mode and I&#39;m forever suffering fools, so the odds are I will.</p></span>

<p>Your irrational assertions are strewn throughout the internet:  Obama&#39;s a black piece of shit, a lying socialist, all sorts of things he is objectively not (point of fact:  most communists are not millionaires....go ask Emma Goldman, Che, Lenin, and Engels).  </p>

<p>Jeff Goldstein is a bastard and you worship him.  Your love of these phantasms you don&#39;t even know in person, but only what they claim on the internet is just absolutely marvelously hysterical.  </p>

<p>After you bounce around telling people that right wing coups in Honduras are democratic; that saving American jobs by shepherding car companies through bankruptcy is evil; that a President whose only change to the tax code in a year has been to cut taxes is really a dastardly vile Commie who is coming for the plutocracy; and that the people who comment regularly at a site that calls Glenn Greenwald a faggot, uses the &quot;n: word in post titles, accuses the half-white president of the United States of being an Uncle Tom and Stepin Fetchit, and that consistently blames non-whites for all the problems in America:  ACORN = evil; housing crisis = caused by minorities; CRA = bad; immigrants = bad, Serr8d (whose most recent racial post involved sending hate mail to defend a racist Tennessee cop) = not racist...</p>

<p>All that means you have not proved you have the discernment to do anything more than tell me if you have shoes on or if it&#39;s raining outside your hovel.  Your attempts at flip hide the fact that you have no clue about what you&#39;re talking about. Your point of view is obnoxious and you are universally wrong.</p></span>

Set aside for a moment the fact that Click labors under the delusion that noticing people of color is more racist than harming them and remember that 1) the figure she defends, Sarah Palin, is using her publicity tour as a prelude to a 2012 presidential bid launch, and 2) candidate Palin is posting photographs of the people she meets on her Facebook page, meaning that these are not images produced by a liberal media elite out to make her look like her appeal is limited to white people but images she and her people have decided should represent her mass-appeal on a mock-presidential bid launch. Time to play &quot;Count the Non-White People&quot;! Image #1: 0 Image #2: 0 Image #3: 0 Image #4: 0 Image #5: 0 Image #6: 0 Image #7: 0 Image #8: 1 (a mall security guard) Image #9: 0 Image #10: 0 Image #11: 0 Image #12: 2 (but only one identifiably of her own volition) In all those photographs, there is one non-white person who can be positively identified as having come of their own accord. To Click, pointing out that Palin's own handlers consider her appeal limited to white people makes me a racist. Over in the increasingly diverse place known as the United States, this is why people like Click should hunker down for a long run of political disappointment. Update. One of Darleen's flock attempts to prove me wrong by being racist.</span></a></div>

Riehl just fails to realize what that pause presages. (That would be laughter, Dan.) I'm sure Click and her claque will call me a racist for pointing all this out, but that's how their knees jerk these days.</span></a></div>
