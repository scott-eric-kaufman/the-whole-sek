			<p>One of the more gratifying things about studying film and television is the occasional payoff. You consider <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/08/realism-and-bad-manners-in-breaking-bad" target="_self">a scene in obsessive detail</a> and it turns out that scene is just as important as you thought it was. This isn&#39;t a credit to you, obviously, so much as the director. (Though it is a validation that you&#39;re not imparting significance to irrelevant details.) So watching the latest episode of <em>Breaking Bad</em>, &quot;Say My Name,&quot; was particularly gratifying for yours truly because it indicated that I didn&#39;t waste a day last week breaking down that scene at the dinner table in &quot;Buyout.&quot; It had a punchline. Recall the establishing shot from that episode:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31803f6c970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Breaking bad00021" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31803f6c970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31803f6c970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00021" /></a></p>
<p>Compare that to the establishing shot in &quot;Say My Name&quot;:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0177445dd059970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Breaking bad00054" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0177445dd059970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0177445dd059970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00054" /></a></p>
<p>They&#39;re nearly identical. <em>Nearly</em>. As I tell my students: shots in which the differences are slight matter more than shots in which the differences are grand. So this long shot is a little longer—the head of the couch in the living room is visible—but the composition is identical, albeit less tightly framed. What does the looser framing suggest? Given the off-center position of the couch-head, the implication is that whatever orderly detente had been reached in the previous episode has, literally, been cast askew. Evidence of the tipped kilter abounds: two of the chairs occupied in &quot;Buyout&quot; are empty, and one of the characters—Jesse in his role as a figure of a son—has been replaced by a bottle of wine. It&#39;s almost as if the director, Thomas Schnauz, is claiming that if Jesse prevented Skyler and Walter from having a conversation in &quot;Buyout,&quot; in &quot;Say My Name&quot; it&#39;s the wine. (And that Skyler&#39;s deliberately putting the wine between them. It had occupied <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/breaking-bad00050.png" target="_self">the majority of her attention the last time</a> after all.)</p>
<p>Point being: Schnauz wants viewers to employ their <em>Highlights for Kids-</em>cultivated ability to discern what&#39;s different about these establishing shots. He&#39;s inviting the comparison, and there are many to be made. In &quot;Buyout,&quot; for example, the &quot;family&quot; sat down to a freshly cooked dinner from Albertson&#39;s. It&#39;s not quite home-cooking, but it&#39;s not entirely processed either. In &quot;Say My Name,&quot; Skyler has sat down with a bottle of wine and a TV dinner. She didn&#39;t even bother to buy the freshly prepackaged meal, meaning she cares one degree-of-freshness less in this episode than she did in the last. And not just about herself:</p>

<p>She&#39;s &quot;prepared&quot; a microwave dinner for Walter as well, if by &quot;prepare&quot; one means &quot;purchased and deposited in the freezer.&quot; The implication in &quot;Buyout&quot; was that she&#39;d plated the food she&#39;d bought at Albertson&#39;s—hence Jesse&#39;s confusion about it being home-cooked—whereas in &quot;Say My Name&quot; Walter&#39;s clearly had to microwave his own highly processed dinner. Moreover, whereas in the previous episode some modicum of social graces kept Skyler at the table long enough to listen to Jesse blather on about the green beans, in this episode as soon as Walter starts talking about Jesse&#39;s replacement, Skyler just leaves:</p>

<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0177445de8e0970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Breaking bad00077" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0177445de8e0970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0177445de8e0970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00077" /></a></p>
<p>And note that she takes the long way:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017617776ca0970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Breaking bad00079" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017617776ca0970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017617776ca0970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00079" /></a></p>
<p>One of the cardinal rules of directing—albeit one championed most stridently by actors—is not to step on someone else&#39;s lines. This scene is blocked so that Skyler callously steps all over Walter&#39;s, and triply so, because she not only stands when he begins to speak, which draws the viewers attention away from him, but she traverses the entirety of the frame and even briefly obscures Walter. That&#39;s three offenses against cinematic norms she and Shnauz have committed in as many seconds. On purpose. </p>
<p>But the best part about studying television and film is when a director genuinely surprises you. Being correct is all well and good, but finding a director who can enliven a cliché is far more gratifying. In &quot;Buyout,&quot; you&#39;ll remember, the establishing shot segued into a series of reverse shots that ended with a medium close-up on Walter&#39;s face as he spoke to Jesse. That&#39;s the pattern established in &quot;Buyout&quot;: establishing shot of the table, series of reverse shots, finish on Walter&#39;s anguished face. In &quot;Say My Name,&quot; there&#39;s no reprieve from the formality of the establishing shot. It&#39;s as if the camera&#39;s telling you that it&#39;s trying its damnedest to establish what&#39;s going on in this shot, it just can&#39;t encompass it. Skyler&#39;s violation of decorum, however justified, only adds to the awkwardness. So when the camera finally cuts from the establishing shot it&#39;s almost a relief:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3180645e970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Breaking bad00084" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3180645e970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3180645e970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00084" /></a><br />Pattern reestablished! That long shot led to a medium close-up <em>except wait a minute </em>it&#39;s daylight and where&#39;s the food and Walter&#39;s dressed differently. Skyler&#39;s violation seems to have justified another: the viewer anticipated the cut to the medium close-up to be within the scene, but Skyler&#39;s behavior necessitated that it function as a transition between scenes. Which isn&#39;t normal. The fact that it cuts to the correct sequence—a series of reverse shots—only emphasizes the fact that the wrong characters inhabit it. This sequence should (and would have) reversed from Walter to Skyler, but because of what he&#39;s driven her to do, it has to take place between Walter and Hank. (The fact that Walter has an ulterior motive isn&#39;t relevant, because I&#39;m talking about the bleed from the previous scene.) Shnauz&#39;s direction here is as effective as it is clumsy elsewhere in the episode, but that&#39;ll have to wait for another post.</p>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/08/new-syllabus-game-of-thrones-bold-plan-or-blasphemy.html"><span><strong>New syllabus: Game of Thrones: Bold Plan or Blasphemy?</strong> The university's revamped the curriculum to emphasize the written word, so now I have to teach a traditional novel alongside my visual works. (Which I almost always did anyway but no matter.) I've decided to teach Game of Thrones, but there's one problem: I've decided to teach Game of Thrones. In a freshmen composition class. That's only ten weeks long. The quarter will look something like this: Week 1: Introduction to the genre. Watch Fellowship of the Ring. Read secondary material about fantasy. Weeks 2-5: Read Game of Thrones. Read secondary material about the novel. Write 4 blog posts and 1 short essay about it. Weeks 6-9: Watch Game of Thrones. Read secondary material about the series. Write 4 blog posts and 1 long essay about it. Week 10: Final project. You see the problem: the novel's 675 pages long, meaning that from Week 2 until Week 5 they'll be reading 169 pages of the novel and approximately 15 pages of secondary material per week. Experience suggests that having freshmen non-majors read 184 pages per week while also asking them to produce 10 of their own pages may be too much for them to handle. So here's my bold (or blasphemous) plan: I let them skip the Daenerys chapters (3, 11, 23, 36, 46, 54, 61, 64, 68, and 72). Because I read the novel on a Kindle, I'm not exactly sure how many pages that will save them. But it makes narrative sense: they'll spend all their time on the island of Westeros and we'll spend all our classtime discussing its affairs in Weeks 2-5. When we shift to the series in Week 6, we'll focus our attention on Daenerys and the events happening on Essos. That means the majority of the visual rhetorical analysis will involve horses, but it could be worse. Another idea, floated by Gerry Canavan, would be to force the students to read one chapter from each of the point-of-view characters and allow them to decide which two they wanted to ignore. They'd have to justify their decision via a rhetorical analysis in a blog post, meaning that they would write that the Daenerys chapters don't provide them with significant information about the context of conversations within the novel, or that they don't believe they're receiving accurate information from Tyrion because of his ethos. I like that from a pedagogical point of view, but I'm not sure about the classroom mechanics. Take a vote and ignore the two characters with the fewest proponents? I don't know. Any other suggestions are welcome.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/08/obamas-the-only-president-whos-ever-bowed-except-for-all-the-others.html"><span><strong>Obama’s the only President who’s ever bowed, except for all the others.</strong> A Republican PAC full of former Navy Seals, Special Operations for America, will be releasing an ad entitled “Bow to Nobody” at the RNC: Ryan Zinke, the former Navy SEAL who started the super PAC, spoke exclusively with Breitbart News today. “The ad itself accurately portrays where this President is,” said Zinke. “It accurately portrays his core belief that America should not lead. This president is shaping America to be one of the followers, to relinquish our role as a world leader. I didn’t fight 23 years as a Navy SEAL to watch America bow to anybody.” He continued, “It’s not just the king of Saudi Arabia. My friends from WWII that fought in the Pacific theater—when they see the president bow to the emperor of Japan, I’ve seen veterans cry[.]” When asked whether it was inappropriate for former SEALs to speak out, as some on the left have alleged, Zinke answered, “If the veterans can’t speak out, who can? I think it’s a duty of every veteran and every citizen to be actively involved in our political process, especially when the president sets out to negotiate away our rights under the Constitution. There have been other veterans—TR, Eisenhower, JFK—they’ve been active in speaking out and shaping the policy and politics of our country[.]” For reasons that will become abundantly clear, that emphasis is mine. Zinke’s logic is that he shouldn’t fight to protect American freedom if the President is going to go bowing around the world willy-nilly. Moreover, he feels entitled to take this stand because other former military men, including the man who was once the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe, Dwight D. Eisenhower, remained “active in speaking out and shaping the policy of our country[.]” Implicit in Zinke’s claim is that someone like President Eisenhower would never diminish the office of the Presidency by bowing to foreign leaders. One problem: conservatives already floated this notion that the President never ever bows so I already know a little something about President Eisenhower: the man could not stop bowing. Hi there, Pope John XXIII! Howdy to you, wife of Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Gronchi! Hello again, Archbishop Iakovos of New York, Primate of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America! Long time no see, Charles De Gaulle! By Zinke’s logic, I believe that last bow means we have all been French since 2 September 1959. Eisenhower clearly demonstrated by that bow that the American President is a subordinate of the French, which means that for the past 50 years America has been a French territory with pretensions of sovereignty. Mon Dieu! (Most of this post was originally published here on 15 November 2009. It seems stupid didn’t evolve much in the last three years.)</span></a></div>
