This would be a conventional pack.</p><p>Nolan spends the rest of the film toying with the relation of a pack to its leader, but the end result is a lot of toying to no real argumentative purpose—unless, given the historical function of the Joker as a character, that inconclusiveness is its own argumentative purpose.&#0160; The Joker clearly wants to lead a pack: he recruits low-level thugs via tryouts, and when humans inevitably fail him, he plays leader to the imprisoned Chechen&#39;s pack.&#0160; Here he is setting them on Batman:</p><p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a7d03f38970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="The joker dog 2" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a7d03f38970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a7d03f38970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a> <br /> But unlike the Chechen, the Joker is not merely a pack-leader—he considers himself one of the pack and follows it into the fray.&#0160; Here as elsewhere, he thinks of himself as a dog:</p><p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a7d041ec970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="The joker dog" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a7d041ec970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a7d041ec970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a></p><p>When he steals a police cruiser, he feels compelled to stick his head out the <em>back </em>window and loll his tongue in the wind like an old beagle.&#0160; When he later confronts Harvey Dent, he claims to be &quot;a dog chasing cars [who] wouldn&#39;t know what to do with one if [he] caught it.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p><p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a7d05322970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="The joker dog 3" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a7d05322970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a7d05322970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a> <br />Does Nolan wants us to believe this is true, despite the fact that it patently isn&#39;t?&#0160; After all, the previous quotation is preceded by the Joker asking, &quot;Do I really look like a guy with a plan?&quot;&#0160; The film seems to want us to believe that he doesn&#39;t, even though it entirely consists not, as the Joker claims, of him spoiling the plans of so-called &quot;schemers&quot; (the police, the legal system, the mob, the Batman), but of those schemers reacting to and trying to foil the Joker&#39;s implausibly elaborate plans.&#0160; The matter of the film&#39;s ideological coherence, then, rests on whether you believe Nolan is complicit with a deliberately self-deceptive Joker here or not.&#0160; </p><p>I go back and forth.&#0160;&#0160;</p><p><em>Note: this post is clearly pretty drafty.&#0160; I publish it because 1) someone asked me what happened to my promised post about the film and dogs and 2) I noticed I hadn&#39;t published anything in a week.&#0160; I&#39;d say I&#39;m not sure how that happened, but I do.&#0160; More on that later.</em></p><p></p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a7d31bcb970b-content"><p>You managed to get through the post without bringing up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English" rel="nofollow">African American Vernacular English</a> meaning of &quot;dog&quot;, which I think is an important one in this context.</p>

<p>Haven&#39;t seen the movie.  But in general, the Joker as archetype works precisely because he&#39;s conflicted.  If he&#39;s a Trickster, he&#39;s not one that has settled into his society.  He&#39;s never, to my knowledge, adopted an anarchist ideological identity.  (Although even The Batman has on occasion.)  There aren&#39;t any stories, to my knowledge, about an alternate world in which the Joker has taken over and become the ruler of everything, as they are about just about every other hero comic books character.  His crimes are famously not really practical, even by comic-book standards.</p>

<p>So what does he want?  Mostly, he seems to want to be appreciated.  &quot;Appreciated&quot; in the sense that people fear him, think he&#39;s important, think about him, etc.  But that requires being a social leader of some sort.  The Joker doesn&#39;t have what it takes to be a pure loner.  He&#39;s too needy.  You always see him bouncing ideas off of his followers or thugs, if not his victims or enemies.  He needs an audience whenever he&#39;s really working.</p>

<p>So, back to &quot;dog&quot;, AAVE.  That&#39;s an identity that the Joker would like to inhabit, right?  Society is against us, but that pushes us together.  They think we&#39;re primitive?  We&#39;ll adopt their slur as a point of pride and show them primitive.  And our pack will give us both communal strength and show off the pack leaders&#39; strength.</p>

<p>But the Joker can&#39;t really do that, because he&#39;s not really part of any community.  He&#39;s too odd, too individual.  It&#39;s not just the conflicted relationship between human and canine sociality there, it&#39;s the conflicted relationship between ordinary comic-book romanticized criminality, which shares a lot with romanticized hip-hop criminality, and the Joker&#39;s archetype as an individual, psychopathic genius who can&#39;t help but have his own agenda.  He doesn&#39;t really need to commit crimes for ordinary reasons.  So he needs his minions, but his attempts to make them into a pack always fail.  He&#39;d like to be a dog.  But he just doesn&#39;t fit.</p></span>

<p>I don&#39;t know if the answer to this is supposed to be obvious but my answer is yes, given that the entire plot of the film is driven by the Joker. The Joker is not much of a character in my mind, as he arguably has one function throughout the film and that is to be as disruptive as possible, and his reasons for being disruptive are muddled in various ways. I guess that is why the film would be seen as coherently <i>incoherent</i> ideologically? But there are other events too that contribute to this supposedly intentional incoherence that lie outside of the machinations of the Joker, like Batman using spyware to locate the Joker at the end of the movie. His use of it is briefly condemned even though it is entirely reasonable within the context of the movie, and then after its use it is destroyed. I think that scene right there (though there may be others, I haven&#39;t seen this movie in quite a while) caused a lot of debate on whether or not this movie was &quot;right-wing&quot; or &quot;left-wing&quot; or whatever (from Andrew Klavan all the way to Socialist Worker), when actually it was intentionally ambiguous, touching hot button issues without actually taking <i>sides</i>. I think such scenes (in a superhero movie) function to please everyone in the audience, especially those not inclined to give superhero movies much praise. </p>

<p>I realize I haven&#39;t said much about dogs here, but with the way Joker&#39;s mouth is sliced and the way he licks his lips a lot, he looks like he has some dog chops going on there. </p></span>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m not even sure how that works.  I mean, how long <em>are</em> his arms?</p>

<p><em>So, back to &quot;dog&quot;, AAVE. That&#39;s an identity that the Joker would like to inhabit, right? Society is against us, but that pushes us together. They think we&#39;re primitive?

<p>For not having seen the movie, you really seem to have gotten the movie.  The Joker wants to be a &quot;dawg,&quot; can earn the respect of &quot;dawgs,&quot; but can&#39;t ever be a &quot;dawg&quot; because he scripts himself into a corner with his pathological neediness.  </p>

<p><em>I guess that is why the film would be seen as coherently incoherent ideologically?</em></p>

<p>This would, I think, be the most charitable reading of the film: the ambiguity about wire-tapping is as deliberate as the characterization of the Joker.  I&#39;m not sure I buy that reading, though, if only because I&#39;ve had students throw both arguments at me for the better part of six quarters.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef012876dcf9bd970c-content"><p>My current read of the film is that it&#39;s an uneasy mix of the elements that Nolan found interesting in the source material and those that he felt he had to include.  I&#39;m not as steeped in said source material as you are, so I&#39;m probably getting the identity of the different components wrong.  My sense, however, was that Nolan wasn&#39;t actually interested the public symbol of the Uncorrupted Man thing, despite hanging the majority of the movie&#39;s dialog around it, and not interested in the Joker&#39;s actual motivations as such.  What I think Nolan&#39;s actually interested in is how people respond to the Joker as a malevolent and unresolvable force of violence.  I mean, the Joker as a character makes no sense (non-comic book henchmen tend to want something in the way of compensation), but I think Nolan keeps him an enigma because a) he&#39;s that much freakier that way and b) it puts the audience in the same position as the characters in the movie who have to determine how they will respond to terrorism without discernable motives.  (I was thinking about themes that run through Nolan&#39;s work and you could make an argument for &quot;capacity for evil&quot;, but certainly &quot;keeping the audience off-guard&quot; would be in there.) The result, for me, was that the parts about the question of response or that actually set the stage for the question of response are really interesting, and all the parts having to do with Batman or Batmanness are entirely uninteresting (Bale&#39;s performance is partly but, I would argue, not entirely to blame).</p>

<p>To put it another way (where I don&#39;t presume to know the Nolans&#39; secret competencies or interests), the key scene for me in the movie was the two boats scene, not as cut away/prelude to the unstopable force/immovable object speech, but the scenes on boats themselves.  Nolan&#39;s message sems to be, not that people are fundamentally good, but that they&#39;re most unwilling to/incapable of  doing something actively evil, even when the situation makes it seem brave or necessary to do so.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t help you with the dog thing.</p></span>

<p>But I did want to mention an additional dog quotation - hope it&#39;s not completely irrelevant:</p>

<p>&#39;You&#39;ll hunt me. You&#39;ll condemn me. Set the dogs on me. Because that&#39;s what needs to happen.&#39;</p>

<p>Into which subject-position is Batman placing Gordon with that comment?  Is it the generic pack leader?  Or the pack leader who doesn&#39;t quite fit the position?  Or the human who masters the pack but stands above and outside it?  Or (given previous sickers-of-dogs-on-Batman) the Joker?  And in being hunted by the dogs, is Batman in a sense leading them?  </p>

<p>This is my first comment here, which I hope qualifies as (tardy) delurking.  I&#39;ve been reading here for at least a couple of years and think I may first have encountered you in Feministe comment threads.</p></span>

What you got?&quot;</strong> &quot;I think you're gonna love her, sir. Check her out.&quot; &quot;I like what I see there, Ferguson, but she doesn't really seem powerful. She needs—&quot; &quot;A more muscular physique?&quot; &quot;Don't talk crazy, Ferguson. She has to be sexy.&quot; &quot;So you need her to be more powerful, but also still sexy.&quot; &quot;Why don't you give her one of those things?&quot; &quot;You know, one of those things.&quot; &quot;I don't follow.&quot; &quot;Sure you do. One of those things.&quot; &quot;I feel you now. You mean like this?&quot; &quot;Perfect! Still sexy, but now that she has a thing, she's powerful too. Great work, Ferguson!&quot; Because, as we all know, female characters can't be powerful unless they have a thing, as the good folks at Detective Comics took pains to remind us this month: Unlike the other example above, her thing isn't even a psychoanalytic surrogate for a thing and its thingly power. Her thing is shaped like a thing and is used for stabbing. I have nothing more to add but this: please stop publishing comics that make me think of Lacan.</span></a></div>

It's a sad truth that having dark skin and sounding different from white people impacts a candidate's electability, but it's a truth nonetheless. What Trent Lott said—what Palin believes to be &quot;essentially along the same lines&quot; of Reid's lamentable political truth—was that he was proud that Mississippi supported a segregationist candidate, and that the if the rest of the country had &quot;followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years, either.&quot; Moreover, to this day Lott hasn't explained what exactly &quot;all these problems&quot; that would've been avoided had blacks been kept in their place actually are. So, for Palin, acknowledging a sad political reality is the equivalent of wishing that the Civil Rights Movement had never happened because, for Palin, racism is a game. Not only is it a game, she unwittingly confesses that she and her fellow Republicans are currently very much playing it by themselves, and are annoyed that the Democrats refuse to play along by &quot;kind of letting Harry Reid's comments slide.&quot; She wants to play Race because just this once, she believes her team can win. Is it any wonder the large majority of non-white Americans find her and her party reprehensible?</span></a></div>
