The hostility Hollywood exhibited toward the auteurs of American cinema in the Seventies has withered as the quality of their films has declined. (Only Scorsese thinks big any longer.) Over a two month period the major studios will have released: Lord of War, penned and directed by the both over- (S1m0ne) and under- rated (Gattaca) New Zealand-born Andrew Niccol The 40 Year Old Virgin, by Judd Apatow, the man responsible for the sublime (but short-lived) Freaks and Geeks The Constant Gardener, Fernando Meirelles' follow-up to his brilliant City of God A History of Violence, the latest by David Cronenberg Oliver Twist, the latest by Roman Polanski Serenity, Joss Whedon's feature-length adaptation of the cancelled (but critically acclaimed) television show Firefly All these films share one common element: they exist only because their directors have clout enough to flip the finger at the contemporary Hollywood system. The steady decline in box office tallies has created a class of directors who, while producing nothing so sublime as Copolla's The Conversation, will produce the most impressive August and September in recent memory. Their films may suffer beside qualitative heights of the auteur era, but the quantitative breadth of quality films they've pushed into American theaters is an equally impressive feat. For the first time in ages the question isn't &quot;Which one will insult my intelligence the least?&quot; but &quot;Which one do I want to see most?&quot; I haven't had the opportunity to ask that question in quite some time. And did I mention television? Despite Whedon's absence, the major networks have managed to field quite an interesting lineup this year: J.J. Abrams' Alias continues on fumes, but Lost is (deservedly) a powerhouse. Fox has forgotten to cancel Arrested Development for the third straight season. Shaun Cassidy returns to television (ten years after the cancellation of American Gothic) with the intelligent and disturbingly timely Invasion. Ricky Gervais' Extras is set to debut on HBO (as are the fifth season of Curb Your Enthusiasm and the third season of Deadwood). No one informed Glen Larson the original Battlestar Galactica sucked. Given all this quality entertainment out there, you may be thinking &quot;Scott claims to be dissertating but he seems to spend an inordinate amount of time watching films and television.&quot; Had I a social life which consisted in more than dissertating all day, pouring myself a drink and collapsing on the couch, your suspicions would be justified. But I don't. So they aren't. Someone once told me &quot;The key to a long academic career is create the appearance of responsibility while behaving irresponsibly.&quot; He neglected to mention that an absolute misanthrope need not keep up appearances. One can be both.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/scholarly_swing.html"><span><strong>Scholarly Swings and Misses</strong> From James Berger's essay (&quot;Falling Towers and Postmodern Wild Children: Oliver Sacks, Don DeLillo and Turns Against Language&quot;) in the latest PMLA: Why did the wild child cross the highway? To show his imperviousness to every medium of symbolic exchange[!] He steps to the plate. Adjusts his crotch. Sets himself. Identifies the pitch. His hips cock, then rotate, as he pulls the bat through the hitting zone. He swings clear out of his shoes. He didn't mean to. But damn is it funny. Addendum: I would've written more on this article--and will in the near future--but I only read it because Holbo wanted to know if I could email it to him. So I figure it's only polite to let him have the first crack. But I have the second (on Berger's strange critique of Sacks' popular scientific writing) all lined up.</span></a></div>
