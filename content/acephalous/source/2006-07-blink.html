<p>Today is one of those rare days I regret not being a &quot;professional&quot; blogger.&nbsp; I have so much on my plate—so much which seems urgent—that I hardly know where to focus my attention.&nbsp; So I'll let someone else decide:</p>

<p>Following Ray's links, I stumbled on Jonah Lehrer's <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2006/06/malcolm_gladwell_and_science.php">lukewarm defense</a> of Malcolm Gladwell's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316172324/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Blink</em></a>.&nbsp; Unbeknownst to you, dear readers, I wrote a very similar account not only of Gladwell's book, but of all popular neuroscience, in which I declared sublime those</p><blockquote><p>&quot;meta-&quot; moments that only books about human consciousness provide.&nbsp; For example:</p><blockquote><p>Picture in your mind the face of Marilyn Monroe.&nbsp; Ready?&nbsp; You just used your fusiform gyrus. (219)</p></blockquote><p>Blows my mind every time.&nbsp; I love books that produce the physiological effects they describe <em>in the act of describing them</em>.&nbsp; Steven Pinker's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393318486/diesekoschmar-20">explanations</a>
may be just-so stories, but the processes for which they account are
solid science.&nbsp; When he says &quot;when Y, then X,&quot; you can be certain that
when a guy confronts Y, his brain explodes with X—even if
X didn't develop because a greater percentage of monkeys who could
scuttle up trees one-handed in the rain survived than didn't.</p></blockquote><p>Now, thanks to Lehrer, I can trumpet Timothy D. Wilson's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674013824/diesekoschmar-20">Strangers to Ourselves</a> </em>too, only without all the caveats Gladwell inspired.&nbsp; For one, the complaint about the dearth of footnotes evaporates.&nbsp; Wilson documents the studies he cites, and I've spent the past couple of hours browsing through those articles.&nbsp; I'm surprised by what I've found.&nbsp; </p>

<p>More often than not, the claims the authors propound are far more radical than those Wilson attributes to them.&nbsp; He tones them down, renders them more palatable to the regnant orthodoxy.&nbsp; Which is odd.&nbsp; Most popular science writers inflate the importance of the research they cite in order to grab the reader's attention.&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/nnh/">Norman Holland</a> and <a href="http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/">Steven Pinker</a> spring to mind.)&nbsp; Why does Wilson take the opposite tack?</p>

<p>I'm not sure.&nbsp; It may be constitutional.&nbsp; Anyone who can &quot;<a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/hix_dixerit_quispiam_or_you_must_try_again_until_you_get_it_right_part_mcxv/">teach the conflicts</a>&quot;—that <em>is</em> the first non-paywalled link I could find—the way Wilson can possesses the rare talent for fairness in the face of vicious intellectual bluster.&nbsp; He presents all arguments—the psychoanalytic included—in their strongest forms and that, apparently, entails deflating the work of contemporary cognitive science while inflating the importance of psychoanalytic &quot;findings.&quot;&nbsp; With the exception of Occam's Razor's appearance on page 79 —there is &quot;no need to introduce additional theoretical constructs&quot;—psychoanalysis seems a viable, if frequently problematic, alternative to contemporary cognitive theory.&nbsp; (Which, of course, merely validates the &quot;scientific&quot; quality of Freud's intuitions.&nbsp; Not that Wilson says that, mind you, only that he doesn't refute it vehemently enough.)</p>

<p>In short, Wilson's book is diplomatic, albeit devestatingly so.&nbsp; What do I mean?&nbsp; His rhetoric aside, one cannot read the first 130 pages and not immediately dismiss psychoanalysis.&nbsp; While some of the mechanisms of the modern brain <em>resemble </em>their psychoanalytic counterparts, they share neither their power nor etiology.&nbsp; And etiology is of fundamental, foundational importance to psychoanalytic thinking.&nbsp; Does this mean that the psychoanalytic model is wholly irrelevant to the study of cultural or literature?</p>

<p>No.&nbsp; (Although <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v009/9.1pope.html">this may convince you otherwise</a>.)&nbsp; I'll write more once I've finished the book and have time to sort through my new theory of the importance of the obsolete philosophies of mind to study of literature.&nbsp; (Sure, I sound dismissive, but the strange thing is, <em>I'm not</em>.)</p>

<p>UPDATE: I included no accounts of the fascinating studies Wilson cites in his book.&nbsp; I'm not sure why, other than the vanilla excuse that I am, on occasion, not all that bright.&nbsp; So I present those tomorrow, after I've finished the book.&nbsp; (It only arrived around 3 p.m.&nbsp; Who can read a 300 page book in two hours?)</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t &quot;fusiform gyrus&quot; just mean a &quot;form that pours out images&quot;?  Through a brain-scan, I suppose, you realize that the &quot;fusiform gyrus&quot; always lights up when you ask the subject to picture Marilyn Monroe.  Of course, you don&#39;t know that it&#39;s called the &quot;fusiform gyrus&quot; when you start out.  You suppose this only after you notice the correlation -- and then you name this area of the brain &quot;that which pours out images&quot;.  Then someone can come along and explain the process to me, saying, &quot;You just used your fusiform gyrus&quot;.  But what does that mean, that I &quot;used&quot; it?  It seems to me kind of like saying, &quot;Whenever you push that button, and only when you push that button, Song X plays&quot; -- but it doesn&#39;t explain by what mechanism the button plays Song X -- and I don&#39;t know how it could.  How could you ever &quot;see&quot; that sort of thing?  The best you can do is say that certain patterns in the brain correlate to certain experiences by way of &quot;meaning&quot; -- but you can&#39;t use the same technique to explain what &quot;meaning&quot; is because you would end up saying, &quot;Well whenever this pattern occurs in the brain, we conclude that it means there is meaning&quot;.</p></span>

<p>This is a notoriously tricky problem, and a sure way to prod a couple of neuroscientists into a quarrel.  They can&#39;t even come to a consensus as to whether consciousness is epiphenomenal or not.  That said, neuroscientists can explain more than mere correlation; they can talk about the nature of the electrical and biochemical interaction which distinguishes one process from another, even if they&#39;re localized in the same area of the brain.  I think they can avoid the circularity you point out here by simple empiricism.  Another way to say that is humanities types (and humanistically-inclined scientists) tend to ask too much of evidence, and too early.  (Thus the problem with Pinker identified above.)  We want an infant science to enable us to produce claims we can only reasonably expect from a mature one; hence, the lack of sophistication relative to psychoanalysis, &amp;c.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-19797669-content"><p>Alex, is the problem that you think that your thoughts are created by your soul, or something like that?  Because if you grant that thoughts are created by biochemical / electrical impulses flowing along nerves, then you have to accept that eventually neurologists will generally trace out which areas of the brain they come from.</p>

<p>The mechanism in &quot;if you push a button, Song X plays&quot; is not mysterious.  Even if you know nothing about the particular box playing the song, you have to accept that an engineer who knows the technology involved could trace out the mechanisms at each step of the chain from button press to song playing.</p>

<p>Since human beings designed and built song-playing boxes, this is not really a good example.  The difference is that we didn&#39;t design and build brains, and we don&#39;t really know large parts of how they work.  But we will, presumably, unless science stops working as it has.  It seems like you have duplicated in technology the in my opinion very poor theological argument about &quot;the god of the gaps&quot;.</p></span>

<p>I hope you don&#39;t think my dislike of science is a sin!  Or worse something irrational!  Surely it&#39;s something we can get to the bottom of, something to which we can assign an explanation and through the use of properly devised antidotes (I almost said anecdotes), correct.  I find my propensities disturbing also -- it isn&#39;t pleasant to be on *this* side of the argument, especially when the neo-empiricists are winning the day!</p>

<p>But there *is* something strange going on: namely, consciousness is conscious of itself.  How can that be?  And I think the song-box example works if you keep in mind that it isn&#39;t *pushing the button* that causes the music -- there&#39;s some other process hidden inside the box.  </p>

<p>But then there&#39;s another issue, which is: how the vibrations get translated into the experience of music?  Now there&#39;s a simple side to the problem, as I think about it, which is that you can devise a symbol scheme that represents vibrations in the air and &quot;write&quot; that on a disk.  Then you just need a media that translates the symbols back into vibrations.  </p>

<p>But the ear needs to translate the vibrations into experience, and that seems to me to involve the emergence of consciousness from something purely material.  That is to say (I&#39;m thinking out loud here, so do forgive the convolution) when I&#39;m conscious of a record playing, I&#39;m conscious of more than just the sounds I hear -- I also am conscious that I hear those sounds.  That, I think, is more difficult to explain.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t believe in God, nor am I vouching for the immortality of the soul, so I have no overt interest in advancing a theology.</p></span>

<p>That, however, is something that can be explained via the mental module theory of contemporary cognitive science.  You have a selective attention, certainly, but you have one module which converts the raw phonetic material of spoken language into phonemic data you recognize as language; another which apprehends the aural patterns in the music you&#39;re listening to; not to mention a whole slew of others doing other things entirely—prioperception of your body&#39;s spatial orientation, &amp;c.  These modules have to run simultaneously; the queston cognitive scientists quarrel over is whether consciousness precedes them, or whether it&#39;s produced by them.  It&#39;s an important question, but also one which matters less than you think, since ever there you&#39;re employing a fuzzy notion of what constitutes &quot;consciousness.&quot;  It&#39;s reflexive and not, say, deliberative; and those systems work differently (as evidenced by the fact that people who&#39;ve suffered brain damage which impairs their ability to process reflexives still retain all other higher cognitive functions).</p></span>

We all have a couple of scholars in our pockets who, in a pinch, we feel comfortable reading what they've written about Thinker X instead of tackling Thinker X herself. Admit it. You and I both know where you learned about Ernst Bloch. There's no shame in it. (Anyway, in Scholar Heaven everyone gets to read all the books they always meant to get around to reading, so why not cut few terrestrial corners?) I say this partly in response to forgottenboy and Adam's comments in defense of Freud on the basis of established utility. As a means to local argumentative ends, i.e. stripped of its universal explanatory power, I could live with the continued presence of psychoanalytic thought in literary studies. I know—and am presently arguing with—people for whom this better-than-squat model enables them to produce incisive work. But I still question its independence. As Ken Rufo recently wrote: The splits that we see at work between so-called modernists and postmodernists, between Lacanians and Deleuzians, between all manner of methodological beasts, are in large part not splits caused by differences in reading for meaning, but rather differences in the methods by which interpretation and the subsequent production of meaning is possible. In other words, the theoretical assumptions that inform the interpretation determine the possibilities and final form that any interpretation will take. That final sentence speaks directly to my concern that even a local psychoanalytic explanation has global effects on the shape and outcome of the argument it assists. The argument may have turned another way—perhaps an equally tendentious one, but differently so—had it not adopted a set of ready-made psychoanalytic concerns. A Jamesian reading may have worked better, but the psychoanalytic has greater appeal. Why? Cultural capital, for one. Tradition, for another. Equally powerful—and equally obvious—is its status as a system of ideas with a built-in fail-safe, what Ernest Gellner calls &quot;a self-maintaining circle of ideas [conveniently] well-equipped with devices for evading falsification.&quot; If we're going to take a short-cut, why not take the well-respected, traditional one we can expertly defend? To put it differently: We all turn conservative when we have our hand in the cookie jar. It seems natural to stuff our guilty consciences behind the most heavily fortified position available, and psychoanalysis is it. I understand the motivation, but fear it over-applied. (In some cases, &quot;only-applied.&quot;) I'm not knocking strong ideological and philosophical convictions per se. I am, however, questioning the seriousness with which they're held when folks betray little or no awareness of the trap 1) integral to their theoretical druthers which they 2) spring with postal regularity. Why not admit it? Why insist that one is open to new ideas when the very system to which one so rigidly subscribes precludes the possibility of accepting them? If everyone else knows you play a rigged game, shouldn't you?</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/psychoanalysis_.html"><span><strong>Psychoanalysis Is Dead! Long Live—Wait, Nevermind.</strong> As a science, psychoanalysis is dead. It does not model cognition, nor does it account for individual or group behaviors it has no hand in creating. (About which, more tomorrow.) You can't read Timothy D. Wilson's egregiously judicious Strangers to Ourselves and come to any other conclusion. All the bulwarks Norman Holland built to prevent its obsolescence have failed. Spectacularly. Unlike Frederick Crews or Ernest Gellner, Wilson &quot;attacks&quot; psychoanalysis by recognizing its importance to the field of psychology and citing it accordingly. (Vicious, he is.) While that move may not appear spectacular on its face, it's crucial to undermining the special disciplinary status psychoanalysis acquired by evolving alongside psychology. Fancying themselves scientists, psychologists distanced themselves from psychoanalysis, which they considered Homo neanderthalensis to their Homo sapiens. With H. neanderthalensis evolving alongside them, they could point and laugh at its crudities but they couldn't deny its existence. There it was, matching their pace, refusing to wither under the derisive hail of H. sapiens. Because Wilson apportions psychoanalysis its proper place in the history of psychology—accepting his discipline's unscientific origins instead of shying away—he can christen psychoanalysis Homo habilis and be done with it. He can afford it the same respect granted all other progenitors: a necessary, but from the present perspective, unsophisticated version of the current model. Just as we outstrip our &quot;handy&quot; forefathers, so too does contemporary psychology outstrip psychoanalysis. I realize how strange that argument sounds, what with evolutionary psychology and its reductive models garnering more attention than their cognitive counterparts. That impression owes more to the inflated rhetoric I discussed yesterday than the current state of the field. Given the evidence Wilson marshals, the discipline cares more about how the brain works than how it evolved, thus relegating those objectionable just-so stories to the status of window-dressing on the mansion currently under construction. (While it may be best-selling window-dressing, no one in the profession mistakes it for it a structural element.) The genius of Wilson's decision becomes obvious when defenders of psychoanalysis argue for its contemporary currency. Like Norman Holland. Holland, in an essay someone assured would accurately present &quot;the actual scientific status of psychoanalysis,&quot; moves through a series of arguments which Wilson's method renders moot. (Although, in citing patient responses to Rorschach blots, it teeters on the verge of being hilariously moot.) Why? Because all of the psychoanalytic categories which still have purchase do so at the expense of their interpretive uniqueness. Contemporary cognitive science still believes that &quot;much mental life, including thoughts, feelings, and motives is unconscious,&quot; but they now have empirical evidence for doing so. Moreover, the evidence gathered shares neither characteristics nor origins with its psychoanalytic correlate—unless by &quot;origins&quot; you mean the equally generic &quot;stable personality patterns form in childhood and shape later relationships.&quot; By acknowledging its place in the genealogy of cognitive science, Wilson diffuses debate over whether it constitutes a viable alternative to it. It does ... to the same extent alchemy constitutes a viable alternative to chemistry. Its assumptions have not...</span></a></div>
