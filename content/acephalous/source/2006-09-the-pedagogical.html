</p>
<p>
That said, I composed something which has absolutely nothing to do with
either book this afternoon.&nbsp; You see, I thought it’d be nice to
introduce myself via a rational examination of a <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2006/09/bill-clinton-lunching-with-bloggers.html">clearly irrational argument</a>.&nbsp; Looks like I was wrong:
</p>
<blockquote><p>So you’ve all seen <a href="http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=243422784&amp;size=l">the infamous photo</a>, right?&nbsp; If not, click on it.&nbsp; Finished?&nbsp; What did you see?&nbsp; <em>I</em> saw an awkward group portrait.&nbsp; Not nearly so graceful as, say, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/robalan/244686172/">this one</a>.&nbsp; Or <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/lambchops/997156/">this one</a>.&nbsp; Or <a href="http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=116883368&amp;size=o">this one</a>, either.&nbsp; It’s <em>almost</em> as if the photo <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2006/09/bill-clinton-lunching-with-bloggers.html">Ann</a> <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2006/09/lets-take-closer-look-at-those-breasts.html">Althouse</a> considers evidence of feminism’s death <em>wasn’t</em>
a carefully orchestrated moment captured by a professional photographer
to commemorate the happiest moment in a young couple’s life, but a
hastily assembled photo op in which a bunch of amateur photographers
told him to stand over there, yes, and her to, no, no, not there, in
the first row, now, yes, over <em>there</em>, look here, thanks.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>Click.&nbsp; Click click.&nbsp; Click click click click click.</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
This confusion, well, it confuses Althouse.&nbsp; <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2006/09/bill-clinton-lunching-with-bloggers.html#115833980447019067">To wit</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m judging you [Jessica] by your apparent behavior. It’s
not about the smiling, but the three-quarter pose and related
posturing, the sort of thing people razz Katherine Harris about. I
really don’t know why people who care about feminism don’t have any
edge against Clinton for the harm he did to the cause of taking sexual
harrassment seriously, and posing in front of him like that irks me, as
a feminist.</p></blockquote>
<p>
That second point?&nbsp; Beyond reproach.&nbsp; Feminists can and do have
reservations about sharing a conference table with someone with
Clinton’s reputation.&nbsp; But the first one?&nbsp; Remember all the sluts in
the wedding photos?&nbsp; The ones who stood up straight, turned a little to
their left or right and smiled for the camera?&nbsp; You remember them, <em>the sluts</em>.&nbsp; <em>They were sluts</em>.&nbsp; What do you mean they look like women “posing” in a group photo?&nbsp; <em>Of course they do.</em>&nbsp; That’s the problem.&nbsp; <em>That’s what makes them sluts</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>
As I read <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/index.php?/weblog/entry/21001/">Melissa’s post</a>, I realized how wrong I’d been.&nbsp; Apparently, it is <em>not</em>
the belief of rational individuals that Althouse confused her hatred of
Clinton for the conventions of group portraiture.&nbsp; Turns out rational
people like Melissa believe the left—the monolithic them<em>s</em> and they<em>s</em> peppering her rant—betray a pernicious hypocrisy by, get this, <em>participating in the American political system</em>.&nbsp; Can you believe the <em>nerve</em>
of these lefties?&nbsp; Forming coalitions of convenience, which their
counterparts on the right haven’t done since the economic conservatives
broke from the Christian fundamentalists—<em>Wait</em>, that never happened.&nbsp; Seems the right fancies this commonplace of American politics as much as the left.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Now, I know writing intelligent criticism is difficult—look at how
rarely you read any these days—but broadsides drawing attention away
from what you’re doing by pointing out that your opponent’s doing it
too are bound to backfire.&nbsp; Which brings me to Glenn Reynold’s ironic
condemnation of partisan politics:
</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s all about supporting the right people politically, even if it turns you into a groper’s support group.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Yes, Mr. Reynolds, I would say.&nbsp; <em>Exactly</em>.&nbsp; Such is the nature of representative democracy: no single candidate will ever reflect <em>all</em> of your personal beliefs to your satisfaction.&nbsp; (That’s why they call it a <em>representative</em> democracy instead of a <em>reflective</em> one.)&nbsp; You have to choose the one who <em>best</em>
represents the majority of them.&nbsp; Sometimes that decision is mildly
unpleasant; others, it is decidedly so; last November, you lose weeks
to the thought that you may be forced to vote for John Kerry.&nbsp; But you
know what?
</p>
<p>You can either act like a responsible adult and admit that this
defect is built into the system; or, like Mr. Reynolds, you can hope
your audience forgets about that and rides your high-handed rhetoric to
ideological complacency.&nbsp; Because believing your opponents are the only
ones whose politicians are, well, <em>politicians</em> is not a sign of intelligence, but unthinking complacency.

This effect revealed itself through an increased mental accessibility of cleansing-related concepts, a greater desire for cleansing products, and a greater likelihood of taking antiseptic wipes. After a quick history of religiously-motivated cleansing rituals, the pair turn their attention to The Bard: Thus, Lady Macbeth's hope that a little bit of water would clear her of the treacherous murder of King Duncan might not have been a product of literary creativity, but of Shakespeare's acute understanding of the human psyche. If physical and moral purity are so psychologically intertwined, Lady Macbeth's desperate obsession with trying to wash away her bloodied conscience while crying, &quot;Out, damned spot! Out, I say!&quot; may not have been entirely in vain. Contemporary psychology may have disowned Freud, but it shares his penchant for literary appropriation. Like Freud, who found in the works of Sophocles and Shakespeare a complex examination of the entry of Man into Civilization, Zhong and Liljenquist saw a student production of Macbeth and discovered bathing: &quot;Look at her! What is she doing with her hands?&quot; A round of vigorous shushings later, the pair exit the theater and park themselves in front of their favorite frozen yogurt stand. &quot;Do you think that Shakespeare fellow was onto something?&quot; &quot;Could be. Should we do a study?&quot; &quot;Sounds great! But how would we study that?&quot; &quot;First, we'll determine whether a threat to moral purity increases the mental accessibility of cleansing-related words.&quot; &quot;Yeah! We'll ask participants to recall in detail either an ethical or unethical deed from their past and describe any feelings or emotions they experienced!&quot; &quot;Then we'll have them engage in a word completion task in which they convert word fragments into meaningful words!&quot; &quot;And of the six word fragments, three could be completed as cleansing-related words or as unrelated words!&quot; &quot;Like W_ _ H, SH_ _ ER, and S_ _P!&quot; &quot;Then we'll see whether those who recalled an unethical deed generated more cleansing-related words than those who recalled an ethical deed, suggesting that unethical behavior enhances the accessbility of cleasning-related concepts!&quot; Or maybe they thought the Shakespeare brand would help them find an audience. Seriously though, I have more of a problem with the unexamined theory of the symbolic favored by contemporary psychology than its psychoanalytic equivalent. Not that depth or complexity necessarily mean anything, but the ease with which Zhong and Liljenquist place cleanliness next to turpitude disturbs me: Physical cleansing may wash away moral sins through symbolic self-completion; that is, people are motivated to complete their self-definitions (e.g., musicians) when indicators or symbols of this definition are lacking (e.g., skills) by engaging in activities that complete the symbols (e.g., training). Thus, when moral self-definition is at stake, such as when one has indulged in morally questionable activities, one should naturally be motivated to engage in activities that will restore moral integrity....</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/09/the_ivory_tower.html"><span><strong>The Ivory Tower?  </strong> Literary scholars are so isolated from what happens in the world. (So say them all.) Today, for example, in between arguing with conservatives about what constitutes a legitimate argument; taking brutal (but clean) body blows from Arbiter of Fairness himself, Timothy Burke; and revealing too much of what I'd planned to say about The Truth about Diversity—in between all that, I read the following articles by Silas Weir Mitchell: Imperforate Anus (1851) A Case of Vicarious Secretion of Milk (1855) Improved Spirometer (1856) Muscular Phenomena Following a Blow on Muscle From a Percussion Hammer (1858) Improved Spirometer (1858) Notes upon the Effect of Alcohol, Glycerin, Water, Gum, Ammonia, and the Vacuum upon the Exposed Hearts of Frogs, Snapping Turtles, and Sturgeons (1859) Experimental Researches Relative to Corroval and Vao—Two New Varieties of Woorara (1859) An Experimental Examination of the Toxicological Effect of Sassy Bark (1859) Zoospermes of the Frog: Concerning their Vitality and the Transplantation of the Testicles of One Animal to Another (1861) A Case of Preternatural Anus (1861) On the Growth of the Nails as a Prognostic Indication in Cerebral Paralysis (1863) Reflex Paralysis, the Result of Gunshot Wounds, Founded Chiefly upon Cases Observed on General Hospital (1864) On Malingering (1864) On the Production of Paralysis in Birds (1868) On the Insusceptility of Pigeons to the Toxic Action of Opium (1869) Observations on Poisoning with Rattlesnake Venom (1870) On the Growth of the Nails as a Prognostic Indication in Cerebral Paralysis (1870) On the Growth of the Nails as a Prognostic Indication in Cerebral Paralysis (1871) The Rate of Growth of Nails as a Means of Diagnosing Certain Forms of Paralysis (1872) Mitchell's titles lost their Frankensteinian hilarity as American medicine became more professional and concentrated its attentions on nails. And their rates of growth. As a means of diagnosing paralysis. (Because, what, the lack of movement didn't give it away?) Those early titles remind me of a bit I used to perform at parties about the trial-and-error stage of chiropractic history: Now I will expose the beating heart! To glycerin! And gum! Only in the original bit, I'd crack-the-back crack-the-back crack-the-back. You know, experimentally. Sadly, Eddie Izzard stole my bit. Now, I'll have to prove that literary scholars don't spend all their time secluded in their ivory towers by making small-talk about transplanting the testes of one animal into another. (One with a preternatual anus, no less.) I'll be the belle of all the balls ...</span></a></div>
