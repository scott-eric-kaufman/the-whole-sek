<p><a name="1">[1]</a>Here's what McLemee said:</p><blockquote><p>I've
been trying to come to some understanding of what the average
rank-and-file Socialist Party member would have meant by the word
&quot;evolution,&quot; one hundred years ago. Such a person might never have read
Darwin. But the evidence strongly suggests that he or she would have
read Herbert Spencer, or gotten Spencer's ideas at second. That
is, from the originator of the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest,&quot; and of
what we now think of as free-market libertarianism.

How could I square that with the socialism of my friends from a century ago? </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Well, long story short, they were also reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Haeckel">Ernst Haeckel</a> (or
hearing about him anyway), and mixing that in, along with other notions
of what the concept implied. In other words, &quot;evolution&quot; meant a
patchwork of information and speculation, with politics determining
how it was articulated rather than vice versa.</p></blockquote>

		<span id="comment-8820083-content"><p>Here are some items that are worth pursuing:</p>

<p>1. Kautsky was an enthusiastic follower of Darwin and Spencer before he ever came across Marx. In 1881, he wrote an article for Die Neue Zeit titled &quot;The Indian Question&quot; that asserted that the reason the Europeans defeated the Indians is that they were technologically backward. Plekhanov&#39;s &quot;Fun­damental Problems of Marxism&quot; also exhibits much of the same mechanis­tic concept of historical change. In the chapter &quot;Productive Forces and Geography,&quot; he makes the case that the Indians of North America remained at a low stage of development because they lacked domesticated animals. These questions are not just of theoretical interest since failure to under­stand them correctly led to divisions between the Sandinistas and the Miskitos, who were regarded as not up to the same cultural level as the Pacific Coast Spanish-speaking majority.</p>

<p>2. In voice-over narration for Spielberg&#39;s &quot;War of the Worlds,&quot; Morgan Freeman explains that Homo Sapiens had earned the right to rule earth because it had developed a resistance to disease over the millennia. It struck me that this ending inverted what had happened in the New World, when the invading European exterminated the indigenous peoples with smallpox, measles and other diseases that they had not developed a resistance to.</p>

<p>In looking at H.G. Wells&#39;s novel, you discover that this was something very much on the mind of the author. In chapter one, he writes:</p>

<p>&quot;And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their only escape from the destruction that, generation after generation, creeps upon them.</p>

<p>&quot;And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?&quot;</p>

<p>As a member in good standing of the Fabian Society, Wells was susceptible to the social Darwinism that leader Beatrice Webb fostered. She was strongly influenced by Herbert Spencer and came to believe that human progress was determined very much by genetics.</p>

<p>It was only a small step from such a belief to the &quot;science&quot; of eugenics. It was a step that H.G. Wells took enthusiastically and that influenced a number of his novels including &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;. As David Levy and Sandra Peart pointed out in an article that appeared in the March 26, 2002 Reason Magazine (a libertarian publication), H.G. Wells&#39; &quot;The Time Machine&quot; tells the story of a future Earth where humanity has evolved into two separate &quot;races.&quot; &quot;Descendants of the working class have become subterranean, ape-like, night creatures who live by eating the decadent descendants of the old upper class. This evolutionary nightmare reflected Victorian ideas about race and hierarchy, and about the undesirable direction that evolution might take if the better sort of people didn&#39;t intervene.&quot;</p>

<p>Wells was very impressed with the work of Francis Galton, a pioneer in eugenics. While Galton entertained ideas about promoting a better human being à la Nazi science, Wells was more concerned about the dangers of mixed breeding. Here is what he had to say about the black/white intermarriage: &quot;The mating of two quite healthy persons may result in disease. I am told it does so in the case of interbreeding of healthy white men and healthy black women about the Tanganyka region; the half-breed children are ugly, sickly, and rarely live.&quot;</p>

<p>Levy and Peart describe the odd affinity that Wells had for Stalin:</p>

<p>Wells was nothing if not energetic. Late in his life, his discussion with Joseph Stalin about the good society was published with comments by G. B. Shaw, J. M. Keynes and others. Unlike Stalin, who trusted that the Party would bring progress, Wells believed in the Scientific Elite. &quot;Now,&quot; he told Stalin in 1934, &#39;there is a superabundance of technical intellectuals, and their mentality has changed very sharply. The skilled man, who would formerly never listen to revolutionary talk, is now greatly interested in it. Recently I was dining with the Royal Society, our great English scientific society. The President&#39;s speech was a speech for social planning and scientific control. To-day, the man at the head of the Royal Society holds revolutionary views, and insists on the scientific reorganisation of human society.&quot;</p></span>

		<span id="comment-8821989-content"><p>Your kind comments are much appreciated, Mr. Acephalous. And it&#39;s been tonic to read the thinking-out-loud entries about your work on evolution. I&#39;m still at a fairly early stage of thinking through my own project, so it was useful to find my hunch more or less corroborated.</p>

<p>The way I framed the question in the passage you cited -- trying to figure out what evolution meant down at the Socialist Party hall, among people who might have read some pamphlets or heard lectures -- introduces all kinds of problems that aren&#39;t there when you are dealing with, say, particular authors or political figures who left archives. The potted version of Spencer that we now think of in recalling that period was a factor, of course. But so was Haeckel, as well as a certain version of Nietzsche. All served up as a kind of gumbo.</p>

<p>On a different note: I never think of my writing at IHE as being a blog, really. The intent, anyway -- the sense of form and possibility of this kind of column -- was shaped by the example of various writers who were dead long before anyone ever came up with the term &quot;blog.&quot; (That may be a nuance with no meaning for anybody else, of course.) My main ambition for IA is just to make it the kind of thing I&#39;d actually want to read.</p>

<p>Again, thanks for everything. But it&#39;s disappointing to learn you aren&#39;t named after Bataille&#39;s posse. Evidently they found somebody willing to be the guest of honor at the human sacrifice they wanted to perform, then Bataille thought the better of it.      </p></span>

		<span id="comment-8824318-content"><p>Louis, I&#39;ve looked at <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/dinner__a_movie.html" rel="nofollow">Wells</a> before, but not in relation to his socialism, only his evolutionism.  I don&#39;t know <i>why</i> I haven&#39;t thought to do this yet, since it seems an eminently sensible thing for me to do, so I appreciate the tips.  (Eric also deserves some appreciation, since I haven&#39;t looked into the Hoxie but now will.)  </p>

<p>Scott--I always feel odd addressing people by my name, but what can you do?--I didn&#39;t mean to say that IHE is a blog, but the impressive pace at which you pound it out is more bloggy than not.  (That&#39;s meant as a compliment.  You see the tripe I produce at this prodigious pace.)  As for the content of non-traditional (from the p.o.v. of literary studies) written records--pamphlets and the like--I&#39;ve read as many as I can get my hands on, but at the time I was reading them I hadn&#39;t focused yet on evolutionary theory, so that&#39;s something I need to get back to.  Ah, blessed leg-work!  (Fortunately I find archival work more gratifying than many people I know.)  Anyhow, we should keep each other posted on what we find, since we may be able to save each other a lot of grudge work.</p></span>

I promise no assumptions’ll be prodded until after I proffer his argument in toto. He articulates the short version of his argument at the end of the fourth chapter: The object of literary interpretation is necessarily the meaning intended by some agent or collectivity of agents. But the object of literary interest is not an intended meaning; in fact, it isn’t literally a meaning at all. The object of literary interest is a special kind of representational structure, each of whose elements acquires, by virtue of its connection with other elements, a network of associations inseparable from the representation itself. (104) Floating there alone, far from the arguments which substantiate it, that claim surely strikes readers as the conventional formalist claim for the autonomy of the literary object. Its “representational structure” closes in upon itself such that being interested in the regicide in MacBeth is “not to be interested in regicide as but in regicide as set in its “galaxy of symbols&quot;--regicide, that is, as suggesting, and suggested by, the thoughts and emotions appropriate to daggers, and crows, and naked babes, and so on” (104). The previous version of this post jumped the tracks by overemphasizing the arguments Knapp proposes and dismisses as he updates Wimsatt’s notion of “the concrete universal.” Here they are: The intended world of an author like Milton should allow “his reader to imagine states of affair whose interconnections would be tight enough, for example, to sustain an inference from Eve’s speaking to Eve’s having a mouth; or from Adam’s standing to Adam’s being in contact with the ground” (9). If he succeeds, his intentions can be divined. If he fails, his intentions can be probed and critics can attempt to supplement the work with whatever it needs to achieve coherence, e.g. the Romantics reenvision Milton’s intentions and in so doing create the coherent Miltonic world Milton himself could not. But Knapp insists that “one’s interest in the problem of Milton’s authorial agency can go beyond an interpretive interest in figuring out what action milton performed or failed to perform” (27). Therefore an interest in analogies between poets and their poems, or poets and readers, or readers and poems is hard to account for in either theoretical or interpretive terms. But [his] claim is not that a non-interpretive and non-theoretical interest in analogies is for that reason anomalous or mistaken. On the contrary, it is precisely for this kind of interest that I propose to reserve the adjective “literary.” (29) Via Keats’ Isabella; or, The Pot of Basil and Kant’s Third Critique, Knapp then discusses the possibility that aesthetical ideas, as represented in metaphor, are suggestive without being meaningful in any predetermined way. Metaphors brim with “negative capability” because they communicate only indirectly. Whatever cognitive content a metaphor possesses, it also possesses...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/08/statements_of_i.html"><span><strong>Statements of Impurposiveness; or, as Gordon Gano Sings: &quot;Lies Lies Lies Lies, Lies Lies Lies, Lies&quot;</strong> Digging through &quot;My Documents&quot; for some notes which have mysteriously vanished into the very bowels of my computer, I stumbled across my &quot;Statement of Purpose.&quot; You know, the thing undergraduates send to graduate schools to convince them that they (the students) are worthy of their (the graduate programs) attention. Needless to say, it's terrible. What it lacks in intellectual engagement it more than makes up for with its dour descriptiveness of my pretensions. I've included it in its entirety below the fold, and I've even corrected the typos, misspellings and factual errors. You heard correctly: I somehow managed to get accepted despite typos, misspellings and factual errors. Anyhow, &quot;highlights&quot; include: I am currently writing an Honors thesis on Thomas Pynchon’s criticism of colonialism and its concomitant domination of language in his earlier novels, V. and Gravity’s Rainbow. In writing this I have had my first experience of what graduate work will be like, and to be truthful, I thoroughly enjoyed the nights I spent in the library reading, among others, Frantz Fanon, Michel Foucault, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. We all remember how well that turned out. This is not to say that I plan on reading theory to the exclusion of other works. I should say not. If now-me could travel back and inform then-me of where he'd end up, I'm sure then-me (a buffer if denser version of now-me) would challenge me to step outside. [I] have started reading the complete works of George Eliot, a task I hope to have accomplished in full by the time the Fall of 1999 rolls around. I cannot be sure, but I think this may have been an outright lie. Sure, I read Middlemarch and Daniel Deronda, but that's far from the complete works. (As Jonathan likes to remind me, I'm still prone to such exaggerations. They're well-intentioned whites lies, however, as they're meant to inspire me to transform them into big colorful truths.) Those goals can and most certainly will evolve as I learn more and discover new literatures and theories, which is what excites me the most about continuing my education into and beyond the graduate level. Something excites him about graduate school? Obviously someone has yet to spend a couple years toiling over a dissertation. My word processor has become a graveyard for needlessly informative or woefully inadequate “statements of purpose”. Some contain my life story in full, some limit themselves to my intellectual history, while others are narrative attempts at explaining “how I got to where I am now,” but their imposed narratives rendered all of them little more than wistful fictions. So instead of making more stillborn contributions to “the story of who I was and how that man became this one,” I will tell you who I am and who I wish to become while attaining my doctorate. “Who I am” is a student interested in the more covertly political statements made by literary works. For instance, I am currently writing an Honors thesis on Thomas Pynchon’s...</span></a></div>
