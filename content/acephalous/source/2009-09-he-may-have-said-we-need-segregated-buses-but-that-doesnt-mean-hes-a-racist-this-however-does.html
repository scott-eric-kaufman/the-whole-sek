<p><strong>RUSH:</strong> We don’t know what obvious taunts.</p>
<p><strong>CALLER:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>RUSH:</strong> Worse than the obvious verbal taunts, we all know the racism that was in the kid’s mind. I mean <em>Newsweek</em>
magazine says he was born a racist. So you know the white kid is
sitting there thinking N-word and all kinds of things being surrounded
by these black students. They knew that. They knew that and so they
just descended on the kid and beat him up. We’ve seen the videotape.
What did the police chief investigate?</p>
<p><strong>CALLER:</strong> He did not comment on anything other than he said more investigations shows that it was not racially motivated.</p>
<p><strong>RUSH:</strong> I think the guy is wrong I think not only was it racism, it’s justifiable racism.</p>
<p><strong>CALLER:</strong> True.</p>
<p><strong>RUSH:</strong> I mean, that’s the lesson that we’re being taught here today. Kid shouldn’t have been on the bus anyway.</p>
<p><strong>CALLER:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>RUSH:</strong> We need segregated buses. It was invading of space and so forth. This is Obama’s America.</p>
<p><strong>CALLER:</strong> Yes. Could I ask another question, not related to this issue?</p>
<p><strong>RUSH:</strong> By all means, since you’re here.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of <a href="http://mediamatters.org/limbaughwire/2009/09/15#0023">the</a> <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/you-dont-say-by-digby-rod-dreher-opens.html">liberal</a> <a href="http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2009/09/17/bus_rush/">outrage</a> at his remarks strip them of their relevant context: the <em>Newsweek</em> article “<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/214989">See Baby Discriminate</a>”
that claims, by Limbaugh’s reckoning, that white people are born
racist.&#0160; Given that all white people are racists, he argues, the silent
tape didn’t capture the racist epithets the white kid shouted that
make his beating justifiable—because it’s not racist to beat down
someone who’s being a racist—and that it would be best to segregate
similarly racist white kids before they provoke their non-racist black
peers into beating them down.&#0160; He and his defenders will read those
expressions of liberal outrage, note that they decontextualize his
sarcastic remarks, and dismiss as stupid anyone who believes Limbaugh
actually called for the return of Jim Crow.</p>
<p>Punishing the straw-Limbaugh not only provides him plausible
deniability, it obscures the actual, non-sarcastic racist assumptions
underpinning his remarks—foremost among them, that black people are
inherently violent and lack self-control.&#0160; They are justified, he
unwittingly argues, in expressing their violent tendencies because the
white kid in his hypothetical said something racist. Instead of talking
with their mouths like hypothetical white kid, black kids speak with
their fists, an idea that is so firmly entrenched in the minds of those
who <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/proving-the-point-i-made-about-him-being-along-the-lines-of-a-rank-bigot-.html">loudly claim to not be racist</a> that <em>even when black kids are talking with their mouths</em>, they are “<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/language-is-revealing-that-dan-riehl-is-a-racist.html">technically <em>thugs</em></a>”
forever on the brink of expressing their innate violent tendencies.&#0160;
Don’t believe me?&#0160; Watch the development of the pronoun “it” in this
bit by Dan Riehl:</p>
<blockquote><p>It went on but not really to a level that was so loud, or so confrontational that it needed to be addressed.</p>
<p>We just ignored them without much trouble at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, they were technically <em>thugs</em>. But the reality was they
were still wannabes really, pretty young, not that big, or many. And if
the several adults there for 9/12 actually needed to do something about
it, the kids wouldn’t have lasted very long. Maybe if they were bigger,
or more numerous, it might have been worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>That first “it” refers to a conversation that was “not really to a
level that was so loud, or so confrontational that it need to be
addressed.”&#0160; But the second one lacks an obvious antecedent and could,
if you’re feeling charitable, refer back to the conversation; more
realistically, “it” refers to the general situation in which young
black kids are quietly saying things in a non-confrontational manner,
and Riehl immediately concludes that that “it” might be a situation that
he and his white companions might need “to do something about.” &#0160; Let
me repeat that: Riehl believes that black kids quietly saying things in
a non-confrontational manner is a general situation that, through no
fault of white people, typically escalates to violence.&#0160; That third
“it” is even more damning: the general situation in which black kids
quietly say things in a non-confrontational manner “might have been
worse” if they were bigger or there were more of them because, had the
people with innately violent tendencies been larger <em>or</em> more
numerous, Riehl and company would have been powerless “to do something
about it” after the inevitable escalation.&#0160; The implication here is
that the physical and numerical superiority of the white adults kept
those black kids in check.&#0160; They <em>wanted</em> to beat Riehl down,
but like the President they admire, they are pragmatists who avoid
fights they can’t win—but put a white kid on a bus full of black kids
and what happens?</p>
<p>Riehl answers that question by the simple act of pairing his
experience on 9/12 with the video of the school bus beating; Limbaugh
answers it by unwittingly revealing the beating racist heart within his
sarcastic straw-compatriot; and the commenters at Michelle Malkin and

needs to justify a preemptive strike against an innately violent party
or parties, and the message is trickling down the airwaves to bloggers
like Riehl and those who read him. It behooves us not to ignore such

He thinks that in Obama&#39;s America, black folk would like buses to be segregated to keep black groups safe from white racism.  It&#39;s a silly argument, but it&#39;s not racist. </p></span>

<p>Rather, he&#39;s highlighting the &quot;blacks can&#39;t help being violent&quot; theme and saying that blacks also must be racist and should be segregated for the safety of white kids.</p>

You&#39;re getting the trope wrong. The trope, which is not just lefty, but mainstream Sociology, is that we&#39;re all (white, black, etc.) racist, because we&#39;re raised in a racially divided society with racist tropes suffused through the cultural mix. The left has used this to say that we can&#39;t assume that we&#39;re the good people who don&#39;t have to worry about racial prejudice, and should therefor be open to other folks telling us that we screwed up. The right of course have twisted this into &quot;The left think that all white people are secretly racist.&quot; This is then used to both dismiss claims of racism and, ironically, rally white racial identity as some kind of put upon class. (In other words, they want to read Minor Threat&#39;s &quot;Guilty of Being White&quot; unironically/context-free). The added problem is that Limbaugh isn&#39;t saying any of this, he&#39;s &quot;saying&quot; it. (&quot;And now I&#39;m using sarcasm to confess the whole thing!&quot;)</p>

<p>SEK, I think that you actually weaken your case by going back to Riehl here, both because you&#39;ve already said everything worth saying about that post, and because Riehl, not being the kind of prominent figure that Limbaugh or Malkin are, doesn&#39;t advance your more interesting argument, that these are influential folks playing to and manipulating a widespread set of fears and prejudices. People get beat up in St. Louis all the time; it&#39;s one of the most violent cities in the US. This brouhaha over a lone white kids getting beat up by a group of black kids makes its way around right wing talky town, not because it somehow proves that Obama will actually make everything worse, but because it plays to a more primal set of fears about race and violence, of which the &quot;race war&quot; commenters are only the most colorful examples.<br />

<p>I&#39;m doing neither, Davis.BR, because your point is completely irrelevant.  I&#39;ll tell you what I tell everyone who complains about it: until you 1) learn what legacy admissions are and 2) are outraged by them, I&#39;m not going believe that your opposition to accepting <em>qualified</em> candidates into universities is based on anything other than pure, unbridled racism.  That said:</p>

<p><em>And by ignoring the myriad implications - social and personal - inherent therein in early 21st century America (and some forty years after Montgomery and the National Guard), you miss the whole raison d&#39;tre behind Limbaugh&#39;s point. Missed. It. Entirely. </em></p>

<p>I <em>dare</em> you to connect the dots between what Limbaugh said, what I said, and what you said.  I can wait.  (Alternatively, what Julian said.)</p>

<p><em>I think that you actually weaken your case by going back to Riehl here, both because you&#39;ve already said everything worth saying about that post, and because Riehl, not being the kind of prominent figure that Limbaugh or Malkin are, doesn&#39;t advance your more interesting argument, that these are influential folks playing to and manipulating a widespread set of fears and prejudices.</em></p>

<p>Riehl&#39;s not there as a person of prominence---no matter what he thinks about his traffic, which he seems to think both a lot of and about a lot---but what&#39;s been trickled down to.  He&#39;s the fiddle being played to the tune of racism, as it were. </p>

<p><em>This brouhaha over a lone white kids getting beat up by a group of black kids makes its way around right wing talky town, not because it somehow proves that Obama will actually make everything worse, but because it plays to a more primal set of fears about race and violence, of which the &quot;race war&quot; commenters are only the most colorful examples.</em></p>

<p>Absolutely.  The fact that conservatives have even <em>connected</em> it to the President is indicative of their bad faith: they&#39;re color-blind, they don&#39;t see race, but middle-school kids of different races scuffle and they&#39;re all &quot;<em>This</em> is why I protested ObamaCare!&quot;  Not that their opposition to ObamaCare has anything to do with race, mind you---it&#39;s merely the first thing that pops in their mind when they hear about a fight in a middle school.</p></span>

He would say, as irate futurists do of flying cars, &quot;Where are my forty million daggers? I was promised forty million daggers!&quot; Pavement were the second or third most important band of his youth, behind only the Replacements and R.E.M., both of whom he discovered in the &quot;R&quot; section of a Rolling Stone album guide that he browsed at the local library after he had been gifted his first &quot;jam box&quot; in fourth grade. Understand: he did not want to waste his allowance on albums of insufficient quality, so he decided to research music and selected R.E.M.'s Murmur and the Replacements' Let It Be because both were awarded five stars and therefore guaranteed to be of the highest quality. Tickets for the September 18, 2010 show go on sale tomorrow and interest among aging hipsters who traded their indie cred in for a lectern is expected to be high. (As to the title of this post, below the fold can be found the obligatory YouTube of an Ouzo-soaked Alexander the Great being born from a box after having been struck by an automobile.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/be-nice-now-the-english-language-is-not-ed-morrisseys-strong-suit-and-he-at-least-makes-a-show-of-re.html"><span><strong>Be nice, now. The English language is not Ed Morrissey’s strong suit, and he at least makes a show of reining in the racist comments he knowingly baits from his audience.</strong> Update. If you came from over here, you need to note two things: first, that Patrick's only talking about the title of this post, which is odd, because in the body of the post the sarcasm of the title becomes absolutely clear. So clear, in fact, that my later clarification is really only for people who only read the title of this post. Second, Patrick completely ignores the argument of both this post and my clarification. Make what you will of his silence as regards anything other than the sarcastic title of this post. It seems Mr. Ed Morrissey caught President Obama fibbing again. See, Michelle Obama said this: I will never forget the time eight years ago when Sasha was four months that she would not stop crying. And she was not a crier, so we knew something was wrong. So we fortunately were able to take her to our pediatrician that next morning. He examined her and same something’s wrong. We didn’t know what. But he told us that she could have meningitis. So we were terrified. He said, get to the emergency room right away. Which the New York Times reported thus: In her speech, Mrs. Obama also told the story of how her daughter Sasha would not stop crying when she was 4 months old. A doctor’s visit revealed she might have meningitis; she ultimately did not, but the illness produced a scare. So far, so consistent: something was wrong with Sasha Obama; she was brought to a pediatrician; the pediatrician told her parents she could have meningitis and advised them to take her to the hospital. But Morrissey is suspicious because [i]n a speech to nurses just eight days earlier, Barack Obama told the story quite a bit differently (emphasis mine): When our youngest daughter, Sasha, was diagnosed with meningitis when she was just three months old, it was one of the scariest moments of my life. And we had to have a spinal tap administered and she ended up being in the hospital for three or four days. And it was touch and go, we didn’t know whether she’d be permanently affected by it. It was the nurses who walked us through what was happening and made sure that Sasha was okay. Well, she wasn’t diagnosed with meningitis. How hard is it to get the facts straight so that both Obamas tell the same story? I know what you’re thinking: this is the kind of close-reading I advocate doing in posts like this. Let it be known, however, that I do not believe paying close attention to language is enough: the conclusions drawn from that analysis abide by the basic rules of logic and the English language. So let me help Mr. Morrissey out: Michelle Obama said: So we fortunately were able to take her to our pediatrician that next morning. He examined her and same something’s wrong. We didn’t know what. But he told us that she could have meningitis. President Obama said:...</span></a></div>
