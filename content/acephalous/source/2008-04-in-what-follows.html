The unknown author of the Rhetorica ad Herrenium, a Latin rhetorical text long attributed to Cicero, states that every argument ought to open with an expositio. Before I continue, I should define what an expositio is. An expositio is a brief statement at the beginning of an oration in which an orator outlines the three issues he will address with his argument.* Contemporary scholars still follow the model Peter Elbow calls &quot;the old perverse chestnut&quot; (&quot;Reflections on Academic Discourse&quot; 144). Now that I have told what a signpost is and related its long and storied history I will demonstrate why they are useful in academic prose. In this paragraph I will demonstrate that signposts are useful in academic prose because they alert readers what you are about to argue and when you have proven your point. I will also prove that signposts make you sound smart because if you know what you want to write before you write it you are hot shit. I will address the second point first. Most people when they write cannot include signposts because they do not know what they want to say when they sit down to write. Only very intelligent people are capable of being what Thomas Murray defines as &quot;the morphological metathesis of hot shit&quot; (&quot;The Language of Naval Fighter Pilots&quot; 128). Now that I have definitively proven that intelligent people are hot shit I will address the first point. The first point of this paragraph was that signposts are useful because they inform readers what you will argue and when you are done arguing it. I am now done arguing it. This paragraph will register my annoyance with what I take to be the overabundance of signposts in academic prose. But before I do that I want to mention the one respect in which signposts are essential. Without signposts it would be difficult to introduce utterly irrelevant material into the body of your work. Maybe you would like to impress someone with your erudition and need to introduce a quotation demonstrating you have read a very difficult book. Or maybe you have simply stumbled upon a newspaper article whose title is too great not to share. I would argue that the following is a salient example of one such article: Were it not for the mighty power of the signpost I would not have been able to shoehorn the title of that article into this post.** In the previous paragraphs I have defended the usefulness of the signpost in academic prose. The inclusion of that headline demonstrates that signposts are both useful and awesome. Now I will transition to the conclusion of this post by telling you that I am transitioning to the conclusion of this post. And here I am at the conclusion like I told you I would be.

			<p>I will begin this post about signposting by tracing the history of signposts.&nbsp; The unknown author of the <em>Rhetorica ad Herrenium</em>, a Latin rhetorical text long attributed to Cicero, states that every argument ought to open with an <em>expositio.&nbsp; </em>Before I continue, I should define what an <em>expositio </em>is.&nbsp; An <em>expositio </em>is a brief statement at the beginning of an oration in which an orator outlines the three issues he will address with his argument.*&nbsp; Contemporary scholars still follow the model Peter Elbow calls &quot;the old perverse chestnut&quot; (&quot;<a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0010-0994%28199102%2953%3A2%3C135%3AROADHI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-L">Reflections on Academic Discourse</a>&quot; 144).&nbsp; Now that I have told what a signpost is and related its long and storied history I will demonstrate why they are useful in academic prose.</p>

<p>And here I am at the conclusion like I told you I would be.&nbsp; In this conclusion I will recapitulate what I have I already proven in the paragraphs above.&nbsp; The words I wrote in the above paragraphs prove that people who use signposts are perverse old chestnuts who are so hot shit they can include articles about whores in anything they write and that they are awesome.&nbsp; I will now conclude my conclusion with the period I place at the end of this sentence.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I feel better now about my almost complete lack of signposting in my chapters. I probably _should_ go back in and add a thesis, though. At least once I figure out what the hell it is.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-109286832-content"><p>Oh my god, when I was writing my dissertation, signposting was nearly the death of me.  I kept wanting, like, the big buildup of narrative tension and then the dramatic reveal, and my advisor kept making notes on my drafts, suggesting that good historical writing didn&#39;t really work that way.</p>

<p>Once I started teaching, signposting got easier, to the point where I now think I do too much of it in lecture.  I made a comment in class, something to the effect of &quot;it&#39;s not like I&#39;m particularly subtle about what the big points are&quot; and they all started laughing.</p></span>

Of course I am not a college student, nor a teacher, but a mere instigator, so this reflection may be irrelevant to everyone who reads it. What an exhilarating thought! Sheer irrelevance, achieved in a note that is a comment on a post about signposts! I wonder if this is finally the sign of madness I have been looking for!

Happy! To! Be! Finished!</strong> I don't know how many other people's dissertations I've read these past five years. Hard to tell. The folder housing however many of them I've downloaded also contains the by-any-reckonings-outrageous number of clippings I've snapped while reading them. Many of them serve one purpose and one purpose alone: To make me feel better about my work. (&quot;At least I didn't write that in my dissertation.&quot;) I wont' be sharing any of those. However, I will be sharing the more innocently amusing ones. I fancy tonight's clip because of the irrational exuberance its author experienced at the mention of a particular novel's subtitle: Anyone care to hazard a guess as to the year this person filed her dissertation? *This and any subsequent posts should be dedicated to the good people at Snag It Industries. They write fine code. For all I know—admittedly not much—their service is second-to-none.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/04/in-what-world-i.html"><span><strong>In What World Is This Considered Acceptable?</strong> Badly executed theory is responsible for 99.99 percent of instances in which I stare mouth-agape at an academic article. The other 0.01 percent is when I read something like this in a 1980 Taxon article on &quot;Cladistics in Botany&quot;: One only has to attend a symposium on classification with cladists to discover that in any given case there is usually no consensus of opinion as to what chosen character is apomorphic and which is not; the reason why there is disagreement is that a certain number of works have a certain classification &quot;in their heads&quot; already and, perhaps subconsciously, anticipate the result of a cladistic procedure. Other biologists disagree because they have something else in mind. This brings me to another nigger in the wood pile: what is character? (emphasis mine) Not the technical answer the author wants, but my definition would include something about resisting the urge to refer to a critical lacuna as &quot;another nigger in the wood pile.&quot; It might even extend to thinking the phrase itself offensive on its face, such that it ought not be thought, much less submitted to peer review.</span></a></div>
