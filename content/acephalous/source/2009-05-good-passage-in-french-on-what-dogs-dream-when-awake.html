Not interested enough to look at it, mind you, but the words COLOSSAL EMBARRASSMENT don&#39;t flash before my eyes when I think about it now, so maybe in a few decades I can sit down with it and see if there&#39;s something publishable in there.</p></span>

<p>Some people seem to get over that hump naturally, but I suspect you&#39;re more like me: the energy to dive back in will come from career pressure. Eventually, you remember that you&#39;re actually interested in this stuff and want your ideas to get some attention. Then, assuming you haven&#39;t completely lost the touch, taken on too much teaching, gotten involved in too many other professional and semi-professional projects and taken on too much personal baggage, you can get some good work done....</p>

<p>Best case scenario? You&#39;re completely unlike me.</p>

<p>Maybe you and Davidson could collaborate on the 19th century one. You could find a documentary filmmaker for your first meetings when you&#39;re negotiating methodology, sell tickets.... never mind.</p></span>

I leave the strap of my shoulder-bag around my neck. A fidgety kid sits down next to me, looks around, and fidgets. Ten seconds later, he decides he's had enough of that seat. He stands up, grabs my bag and starts to walk away. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; I say. &quot;WHAT?&quot; The room goes dead silent. I point to strap around my neck and say, &quot;I think that's my bag you have there.&quot; &quot;FINE.&quot; Then he drops my bag and walks away. He was loud, but it was an empty roar. No malice to it. Nor do I think he was trying to steal my bag. If pressed, I'd say the kid probably had no clue where or even who he was. He was toast. All of which is only to say, people who have never worked in the quarter system have absolutely no idea what those last few weeks of Spring Quarter are like, because there's nothing comparable to them in the semester system . . . and I think that's probably a good thing.</span></a></div>

I'd love to read it again, now that I'm a week away from filing my dissertation.&quot;</strong> (Considering the alternatives, I love the fact that this post is the one I might be remembered for. As I noted at the time, I'd had this half-written for ages but never could quite finish it. This post is as close to naked as I get—so much so I deleted it two seconds after I'd posted it before reversing course. I've received emails thanking me for this post from struggling grad students in chemistry, physics, political science, geography, geology, English, Spanish, French, Russian, education, mathematics, astrophysics, statistics, philosophy, biology, molecular chemistry, history of consciousness, and dance departments. It is, as the person who requested I repost it tonight said, an academic version of &quot;You Are Not Alone,&quot; which would be much more awesome if it didn't analogize me into Michael Jackson. That said, I'm more than happy to oblige this request, and apologize for the overlong introduction. But before I get to the post itself, I should say that [1] the reason my interlocutor couldn't find this post is because my category for all things baseball is the Spanish &quot;béisbol,&quot; and [2] if you read my post without reading Wally's comment, you've done yourself a disservice.) In &quot;On Sad and Joyful Passions of Academia,&quot; Anthony writes: I get that people are unhappy with their advisors, with the lack of support from the university, and from the seeming glacial pace of publishing ... But the complaints, especially from those fully funded at institutions I would imagine are very exciting, foster a different sad passion within me. They even foster a kind of resentment that they have been given this opportunity while I have to scratch out a future ... yet they seem to enjoy nothing about academic work. The best way to talk about academic work is baseball. This goes without saying. I played third base and shortstop. I played them well. I had sure hands and quick feet. When the ball screamed off the bat, there was no time to think. There was only time to react. Move the quick feet. Catch with sure hands. Throw the ball. In between pitches, I would look to the man to my left to make sure we knew our assignments. Then the ball would leave the pitcher's hand. Then the batter would swing. Move the quick feet. Catch with sure hands. Throw the ball. In the infield I felt like part of a team. I could look to my left and catch the second baseman's eye. I could look across the diamond and catch the first baseman's eye. I was a player among players. We all knew how to react and how to react together. Then one year my coach wanted me to play center field. Being a team player, I consented. I'd shagged flies during practice, and was better than most at going back on a ball. So why not? I left the dugout and jogged past my teammates. Then I kept jogging until my teammates looked like toy soldiers. I stood...</span></a></div>
