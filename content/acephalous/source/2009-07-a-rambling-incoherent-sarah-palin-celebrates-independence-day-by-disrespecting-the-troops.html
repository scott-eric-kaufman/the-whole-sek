			<p>Sarah Palin closed her confused <a href="http://www.gov.state.ak.us/exec-column.php">resignation speech</a> by quoting a famous American general:
</p><blockquote><p>In the words of General MacArthur said, “We are not retreating. We are advancing in another direction.”*</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, given the depth of Palin’s erudition—<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/07/-and-the-award-for-missing-the-point-goes-to.html">like Reagan</a>, she’s “dumb as a fox” to <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/07/03/breaking-palin-to-make-an-announcement-in-wasilla-at-3-pm-et/comment-page-1/#comment-2383459">those who watch</a> <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/07/03/breaking-palin-to-make-an-announcement-in-wasilla-at-3-pm-et/comment-page-2/#comment-2383684">her press conferences on mute</a>—it should surprise no one that she grabbed the first patriotic-sounding quotation about “advancing” <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=advancing+quotes">that Google returned</a> and tacked it onto her speech. </p>
<p>This is what passes for knowledge among some conservatives: the
ability to quote-mine the internet for something that sounds patriotic.
(Google may not <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/google">be making <em>us</em> stupid</a>,
but the same cannot be said for many of them.) Because their paragon of
intellectual achievement is a woman who cannot remember what newspapers
she reads every day, it is only fitting that Palin’s last words on the
national stage—intended to demonstrate that the “easy path” in life
paradoxically involves “plod[ding] along” by “sit[ting] down and
shut[ting] up,” because everyone knows that “a quitter’s way” is one of
perseverance in the face of adversity—should be a misattributed
misquotation ripped from its context in a way that conservatives would,
under normal circumstances, consider insulting.</p>
<p>In attributing the quotation to General MacArthur, she is
disrespecting the life and service of the man who actually spoke
something similar to those words; and in analogizing her plight to that
of the men who served under the General she disrespected, she is
belittling the memory of their sacrifice. </p>
<p>In the winter of 1950, General Oliver Prince Smith and his 1st Marine Division were ordered to march north to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalu_River">Yalu River</a>,
on the border between China and Korea. The order was given by Major
General Edward “Ned” Almond, an obsequious lackey with an ego to rival
Patton’s who functioned as “MacArthur’s MacArthur [by taking]
MacArthur’s vision of what was supposed to happen and [bringing] it
directly to Korea, where he employed it, whether it fitted the Korean
reality or not” (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401300529/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Coldest Winter</em></a>
163). Smith, called “Professor” for his deliberate manner and attention
to detail, surveyed the land and determined that the Korean reality
didn’t fit MacArthur and Almond’s vision at all, and though he obeyed
the command to press north, he did so in a manner that befitted his
nickname:</p>
<blockquote><p>General Almond had already begun to notice that the
spearhead was hardly moving at all. We were in fact just poking
along—deliberately so. We pulled every trick in the book to slow down
our advance, hoping the enemy would show his hand before we got more
widely dispersed than we already were. At the same time we were
building up our levels of supply at selected dumps along the way. (432)</p></blockquote>
<p>When the Chinese attacked the 1st Marine Division (19,000 soldiers)
with six divisions (60,000 soliders) of its own in the Chosin River
Basin, Smith and his soldiers were prepared: by day, they would avoid
the roads by moving south through the mountainous terrain, shelling the
advancing Chinese from the high ground; by night, they would temper the
bitter chill of winter by hunkering down near the dumps Smith had had
the foresight to supply. </p>
<p>Smith had calculated the odds of a successful push north, found them
wanting, and prepared for the inevitable. So when the vastly outmanned
1st Marine had to move back through the Chosin Reservoir, they were
able to inflict massive casualties on the superior Chinese force, which
lost 40,000 troops to the 1st Marine’s 561. When a journalist asked how
Smith and his men had done so much damage while retreating, Smith
replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Retreat, hell . . . we’re simply attacking in another direction. (470)</p></blockquote>
<p>Palin’s hastily convened press-conference and incoherent statement
are, to her mind, analogous to Smith’s carefully planned
counter-offensive—or would be, if she knew Smith said it. Which means
that for her, MacArthur is not a hero to be venerated, but a prop to
wheeled out when it’s politically expedient to do so. She cares nothing
for the man himself or those under his command. If she did, she would
show her respect by <em>doing more than a Google search and pulling the first “good” quotation she found</em>.
After all, nothing demonstrates a deep and abiding respect for the
military more forcefully than the sort of stunt my freshmen pull.</p>
<p>So Sarah Palin flubbed the quotation <em>and</em> the attribution. So she appropriated the phrase of a man who <em>fought</em>
the inane orders of blinkered bureaucrats and took what she so
arrogantly dismisses as “the worthless, easy path.” He took what she
calls “a quitter’s way out,” laying the groundwork for his success in
the face of adversity by “keep[ing his] head down” and “plod[ding]
along.” So what: <em>Smith</em> is the quitter. He didn’t even <em>advance</em> in a different direction, he merely <em>attacked</em>.</p>
<p>To go back to an analogy with which Palin is
comfortable—basketball—Smith looked at the game plan, surveyed the
opposing team, and ran the point in a way that would guarantee a shot
at victory. He urged his men to challenge the bigger, stronger team in
the lane; to take the charges, shoot the foul shots, and keep the game
the close until the buzzer. Palin, however, panicked when the situation
on the floor didn’t correspond to her game plan, <em>grabbed the ball and ran crying off the court</em>. </p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef011570c400e8970c-content"><p>Two &quot;in fairness&quot; points: First, conservatives may be shockingly tolerant of Palin&#39;s intellect, but I don&#39;t think you could find even a Free Republic commenter to call her the conservative &quot;paragon of intellectual achievement,&quot; or even something close enough to make the hyperbole fair.</p>

<p>Second, she actually <i>didn&#39;t</i> do the &quot;In the words of General MacArthur said&quot; gaffe in the actual speech.  Yes, it&#39;s in the written remarks, but if you watch the video what she says is, &quot;Take the words of General MacArthur.  He said…&quot;  I was disappointed, because I read the speech first and was anxious to see her say that, but it seems that her improvisation served her well there.</p></span>

Sure, most of it was boilerplate she&#39;s been using for a year or more, and most of that could have been dropped <i>if you&#39;re not a politician interested in creating a public record</i>, but she actually did OK. </p>

<p>Yeah, not on the quotation, but she could well be telling us that she, like Smith, is playing a different game. That much I believe.</p></span>

Brent Bozell, of the ironically named “Media Research Center,” who refuted Oliver Stone’s comment that “Nixon always said Reagan was a dumb son of a bitch” by quoting a number of prominent figures in Reagan’s administration who thought Reagan was really smart: I turned to Frank Donatelli, the White House Political Director under President Reagan from 1987 through 1989 . . . Richard Allen, Reagan’s National Security Advisor . . . [and] Gary Bauer[, the] Domestic Policy Advisor under the Gipper for two years[.] All of them agreed that real “dumb son of a bitch” was Stone, who—according Bozell in a letter addressed to Stone—is an historian because he once claimed to be: Some producer [of Comedy Central's Politically Incorrect] really thought in extremes when they pitted Oliver Stone and Brent Bozell for one episode. I have to say that you were gracious, charming, engaging, and we enjoyed ourselves—except for that moment when I chastised you for claiming you’re an historian. You bristled and denied ever claming that moniker. I cited the source, an interview in some West Coast paper (I can’t recall which one now). Even though Bozell can’t remember the name of the paper, he somehow managed to re-read the article later and [i]t turns out that you were right (in the article) and I was wrong. So Bozell was wrong, Stone never claimed to be an historian, but that doesn’t mean Bozell wasn’t also right: You are an historian whether you believe it or not. You make films about history and historical figures. You record history, and that makes you an historian. Now that Bozell, through the cunning use of italics, has transformed Stone into an historian, he can finally slam him good and proper: Being an historian is not the problem. It’s that you’re a lousy historian. In short, Stone isn’t what he never claimed to be, but is what Bozell says he is, and a lousy one at that. The evidence: “Nixon always said Reagan was a dumb son of a bitch,” you said, and the audience laughed, and you smiled and decided to take that statement further by agreeing with it. So you said, “You know, I think that he was,” and the audience now cheered and hooted and applauded. See what I mean when I say you’re a lousy historian? There are two claims being made here: one, that Nixon thought Reagan was a dumb son of a bitch; two, that Oliver Stone thinks Reagan was a dumb son of a bitch. Unfortunately for Bozell, Nixon illegally taped every conversation he ever had, and when we consult his conversations with Henry Kissenger on the morning of November 17, 1971 [620a.mp3], we learn that while Nixon didn’t use those exact words—about Reagan, at least, since we know he used that particular phrase about everyone from the Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, to the Director of the Secret Service, James Rowley, to one of his own White House aides, Tom Charles Huston—he...</span></a></div>
