<p>Moving to a close-up of Eben, played in the film by Josh Hartnett:</p>

<p>It&#39;s not in the book, but I&#39;m not the sort of stickler who wants a literal translation, so whatever.</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e31c93aa970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="30 days of night00001" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e31c93aa970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e31c93aa970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="30 days of night00001" /></a></p>
<p>I understand, the camera was a little close to Hartnett and you couldn&#39;t see Melissa George&#39;s Stella﻿, so the audience would be clueless as to how she felt about her (in the film) ex-husband, who she only realized she&#39;d fallen back in love with after he&#39;d doomed himself to save her:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e5fc1b2b0970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="30 days of night00001" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e5fc1b2b0970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e5fc1b2b0970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="30 days of night00001" /></a></p>
<p>I was wrong, apparently the camera wasn&#39;t close enough to Hartnett&#39;s face to register the fact that he&#39;s about to die, so an extreme close-up is very much in order.</p>

<p>Just in case you forgot where we were and what was happening, a re-establishing shot. &#0160;Slade doesn&#39;t think you&#39;re an idiot with the short-term memory of an untrained seal, but he&#39;s not sure you aren&#39;t either. &#0160;At least he&#39;ll replicate the quiet, off-panel dignity of Eben&#39;s death by having it occur off-screen.</p>

<p>Alaska, I remember now, and the character who just died Jesus-styled just died. &#0160;Wait—I&#39;m confused. &#0160;Who am I supposed to sympathize with now?</p>

<p>The grieving widow, I remember now. &#0160;But I wouldn&#39;t have, were it not for the extreme close-up and frontality. &#0160;(And just in case I forgot someone just died, Slade was kind enough to leave Eben&#39;s crusted head in-frame.)</p>
<p>Even without talking about the diegetic (Eben&#39;s scream) and non-diegetic (the thumping score) sound, this scene violates what I call the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayenu" target="_self">Dayenu</a>&#0160;</em>Principle. &#0160;For those of you who aren&#39;t Jewish, &quot;<em>Dayenu</em>&quot; roughly translates as &quot;it would have been enough,&quot; and we sing this song on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover" target="_self">Passover</a>, the holiday whose events it roughly narrates. &#0160;(For example: &quot;If He had just brought us out Egypt, it would have been enough. &#0160;If He had just executed the Egyptians, it would have been,&quot; etc.) &#0160;The point being, the <em>Dayenu </em>Principle refers to those moments in a film in which a director beats his audience over the head with a meaning-stick so viciously that its members stumble away stoned with pain. &#0160;So, as to the above:</p>
<p>If Slade had just used a medium shot of Eben and Stella, it would have been enough; if he had only used two establishing shots, it would have been enough; if had merely used one close-up to drum up sympathy via frontality, it would have been enough; etc. &#0160;</p>
<p>In short, instead of the quiet, dignified death in the book—which is neither more nor less inherently moving for its quiet dignity, unless you&#39;re talking about its effectiveness—the audience of the film is treated to a beating at the hands of a man who is, in visual rhetorical terms, YELLING YOU THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE YOU WILL BE HAVING. &#0160;THERE IS NO <em>DAYENU</em>. &#0160;THERE IS CAN BE NO ENOUGH. &#0160;Add in an image of me thumping on the table with my meaning-stick and you pretty much have my last day of class.</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e5fc5cbde970c-content"><p>Didn&#39;t see the film, but how jumpy were all these cuts?  Horror often builds on the frantic-running-away-from-the-monster trope with an array of disorienting cuts to different distances, perspectives, etc., so why not redo that here, with a twist?  In this case, the implacable monster is the sun, and the victims are frantically...spending their last few moments sitting together. It&#39;s certainly not the peaceful exit that the book showed, but it&#39;s not an entirely unrealistic way to construct a such a scene either, and it actually implies there was some thought put into this sequence.</p>

<p>Or am I giving Slade too much credit here?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e5fd08793970c-content"><p>You&#39;re right of course that Hollywood films tend to be &quot;excessively obvious&quot; on a formal level (to use Bordwell&#39;s phrase), but a big reason for that is that films exist in time as well as space. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t think the difference between comic and film is quite as egregious and bludgeon-y as you suggest here. We can linger on or re-&quot;read&quot; the panels in the comic, but we don&#39;t have that option watching a film. Comparing the comic panels to film stills (removed from our temporal experience of them) suggests an equivalence to these images and ends up overstating the ham-fistedness here. (Not that it&#39;s not ham-fisted--just not quite this much.)</p></span>

He blames the mislabeling, but that's beside the point, which is that a woman who looked an awful lot like this, only older, cut to the front of his line. ANGRY WHITE PATRIOT LADY: I DON'T HAVE AN APPOINTMENT! DMV EMPLOYEE: Then I'll have to ask you to step to the back of the line. ANGRY WHITE PATRIOT LADY heads toward the end of the &quot;appointments only&quot; line. DMV EMPLOYEE: Ma'am? The other line. DMV EMPLOYEE points out the window to the line that's snaking from her counter and around pretty much the entire building. ANGRY WHITE PATRIOT LADY: YOU WANT ME TO WAIT THERE! DMV EMPLOYEE: That's the line for people who don't have appointments. ANGRY WHITE PATRIOT LADY: THEN I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT! DMV EMPLOYEE: (issues a blank, well-practiced stare) ANGRY WHITE PATRIOT LADY: I'M A PROUD WHITE AMERICAN! YOU CAN'T MAKE ME WAIT IN LINE WITH THEM! EVERYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM, THE MAJORITY OF WHOM AREN'T WHITE AND CAN'T BELIEVE SHE JUST SAID THAT: !?! To placate ANGRY WHITE PATRIOT LADY, DMV EMPLOYEE gives her a ticket and tells her to sit down. ANGRY WHITE PATRIOT LADY sits down visibly satisfied in her exercise of X-treme privilege. SEK, whose ticket reads &quot;B 047,&quot; is called to Window 12 after about another an hour. SEK: (to DIFFERENT DMV EMPLOYEE) Why'd you give that lady a ticket? DIFFERENT DMV EMPLOYEE: Oh, we gave her a ticket. She's T 099. When they pull that, they all are.</span></a></div>

That said, I find the book far more unlikeable than the film. Consider the scene in which Enid and Rebecca first meet the waiter they dub &quot;Weird Al&quot; in the novel: It's not that they mock the decor of a restaurant they patronized solely to patronize, but the manner in which they treat Allen. Enid responds to his &quot;Hi! My name is Allen&quot; with &quot;Hi, Al!&quot; If he had wanted to be called &quot;Al,&quot; presumably he would have introduced himself as such. Enid renames him on the spot, and without getting all pop-philosophical about the significance of the act of naming something, her behavior here is indicative of her general belief that she's superior to people who look and are employed like him. But Rebecca's response is even more indecorous: the insult that had been implicit in Enid's renaming is explicit in Rebecca's question, &quot;Can we call you 'Weird Al'?&quot; That she asks whether &quot;we&quot; can call him &quot;Weird Al&quot; is significant, because throughout the book she's only emboldened to behave in this manner when Enid initiates such encounters. In short, then, Enid's culpable both for her own statement and for Rebecca's, because Enid's responsible for the dynamic that makes Rebecca feel perpetually, if not always consciously, egged-on. At this point in the analysis, it's possible for readers to attribute the pair reveling in their unearned sense of superiority to an authorial critique, i.e. that Clowes is representing their reprehensible behavior, not endorsing it. But as I noted in my earlier post, Clowes' own—albeit earned—sense of superiority infects most of his work, in this case in the fifth panel above. Despite my formalist tendencies, I don't normally place too much stock into matters like the placement of speech bubbles, but between teaching this and Alison Bechdel's Fun Home, I'm compelled to ditch my insistence that where the text is placed on a page matters less than whether readers can quickly ascertain the manner in which it was intended to flow. So, for example, in the second panel above Enid's conversation-stopping &quot;Whatever&quot; is separated from the mock-Fifties banter not only for the pragmatic reason that it wouldn't fit, but because it's meant to indicate a distinct break in the established conversational rhythm. Clowes could've drawn the panel in a manner that placed it immediately beneath Rebecca's question, but that would suggested that Enid responded immediately; instead, placing it beneath the table suggests that she paused a beat before humiliating Rebecca for playing the language game Enid herself had initiated. Apply the same logic of placement to the...</span></a></div>
