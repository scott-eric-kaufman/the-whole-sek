He enlists the aid of intergalactic Nazi financiers because both can be slaughtered with impunity, and for pages and pages, the reader is treated to exactly that: violence unburdened of the need to justify its existence because these Nazis aren't even people, so why should there be a check as to the degree or kind of violence acts perpetrated against them? The problem with Millar's role-reversal should be obvious: The Ultimates is a What If...? title that explores what would happen if the Nazis were considered less than human instead of the Jews. Millar loves &quot;the flip&quot; more than any other narrative device, but in The Ultimates (as in Red Son), he is incapable of thinking through the consequences his counterfactuals have for his characters. In The Ultimates, for example, he failed to notice that he transformed Captain America into jingoistic ass presiding over an abattoir, meaning his reversion to the uncomplicated and sympathetic character he had been reads false.

<blockquote>What if Batman was a total cunt?</blockquote><p>
Mystery solved! I react poorly to Millar&#39;s work because despite its adult themes, adult language, and adult visuals, it is written <em>by a child</em> and intended to appeal to readers who live in a world devoid of moral complexity.* It&#39;s no accident that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0785109609/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Ultimates</em></a> opens with Captain America fighting Nazis: Millar&#39;s attracted to the cleanliness of the period, <em>i.e.</em> to wars whose necessity is self-evident, because that allows him to focus on action-packed-violence as an end in itself. Moreover, when the body of Steve Rogers is discovered in the second issue, it provides Millar an opportunity to import what he considers a laudable moral simplicity into our decidedly complex historical moment. </p><p>What began bad quickly turns awful, as Millar decides to follow in the footsteps of <em>Adrian Veidt</em> and unite the world by means of an invasion of aliens <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skrull#Ultimate_Skrulls"><em>who are also Nazis</em></a>;&#0160; but the worst part about his game of perpetual one-upmanship is that, unlike Veidt, there is precious little evidence that Millar even momentarily weighs the moral consequences of his fictional narrative. He enlists the aid of intergalactic Nazi financiers because both can be slaughtered with impunity, and for pages and pages, the reader is treated to exactly that: violence unburdened of the need to justify its existence because <em>these Nazis aren&#39;t even people</em>, so why should there be a check as to the degree or kind of violence acts perpetrated against them?
</p><p>The problem with Millar&#39;s role-reversal should be obvious: <em>The Ultimates</em> is a <em>What If...?</em> title that explores what would happen if the Nazis were considered less than human instead of the Jews. Millar loves &quot;the flip&quot; more than any other narrative device, but in <em>The Ultimates</em> (as in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401224253/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Red Son</em></a>), he is incapable of thinking through the consequences his counterfactuals have for his characters. In <em>The Ultimates</em>, for example, he failed to notice that he transformed Captain America into jingoistic ass presiding over an abattoir, meaning his reversion to the uncomplicated and sympathetic character he had been reads false. You would think—you would <em>hope</em>—that Millar would notice that there&#39;s something disturbing about slotting Captain America into the spot reserved for Nazis in that analogy, but he doesn&#39;t. </p><p> His characters are who they are and they can be no one else, which means the possibility for character development is limited to the teleological process of becoming who you were destined to be, <em>e.g.</em> Superman and Batman in <em>Red Son</em>, both of whom embody the essence of their characters in their purest form despite having been born and raised in the Soviet Union. The drawback with distilling a character like Batman down to his purest form is, of course, that the purest form of Batman wouldn&#39;t be Batman because, as a character, Batman is the product of a daily moral calculus with no correct answers. Millar flattens the character into the sum total of his talents because, for him, Batman is little more than preternatural athlete with tactical genius.</p>
<p>Which brings us back where we started: <em>Nemesis</em> is purportedly riffing on Batman, and yet the book contains not one whit of moral ambiguity. All of which is only to say, despite the low expectations I went into it with, <em>Nemesis</em> somehow managed to still disappoint. </p>
<p>*For more on the sexist content of his comment, check out <a href="http://erinpolgreen.com/">Erin Polgreen</a>&#39;s <a href="http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2010/03/22/lame-ass-comics-scribe-mark-millars-work-is-sexist-and-racist-so-how-come-hes-so-famous/">guest-post</a> at Ackerman&#39;s place, in which she argues that Millar is the intellectual heir of Rob Liefeld. (About which I can only say: <em>Ouch</em>.)</p>

<blockquote>Marvel President Dan Buckley sort of paid me a compliment, saying, &quot;This is such a stupidly simple and obvious idea. I can&#39;t believe nobody&#39;s ever come up with it before. You are the master of the stupidly simple idea.&quot; . . . But, yeah. &quot;Nemesis&quot; is a reversal of the Bruce Wayne or Tony Stark archetype. What if this genius billionaire was just this total shit, and the only thing that stood between him and a city was the cops? It&#39;s Batman versus Commissioner Gordon, in a weird way. Or maybe a super-villain version of &quot;Se7en.&quot; A billionaire anarchist up against ordinary people. The Joker&#39;s the best thing in the Batman movies, so this guy is a bit of an amalgamation of all the stuff we like.</blockquote>

<p>First of all, the line about the Joker is sort of infuriating because that debate -- about whether comic book villains are more interesting than the heroes and what that means for the form, is long-running and actually an interesting conversation. But you wouldn&#39;t know that from him. </p>

<p>Secondly the &quot;genius billionaire [who is] this total shit&quot; has been done many times before in comics. There is something original, I suppose in making that billionaire a loner villain rather than having him head an organization, but that too seems hardly original. </p>

<p>I confess, it&#39;s a little bit trickier to think of examples than I would have thought but Lord Shingen from the <a href="http://wolverinelimitedseries.com/story.html" rel="nofollow">Wolverine limited series</a> was a fantastic villain. You could also think about the Captain America story arc in which the Red Skull was using a clone of Steve Rogers&#39; body. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m thinking too hard, there have to be simpler examples -- such as almost every Bond villain ever.</p></span>

<blockquote>Millar&#39;s definitely Women in Refrigerators kind of author: remember what he did to the Engineer in Authority?</blockquote>

<p>No, but only because I deliberately avoided it.  I&#39;ll read Millar when I know Ellis will come around and smack him down, but not the other way around.  Honestly, the only reason I read <em>Nemesis</em> was because it was forced on me by someone who knows how I feel about Millar.  He thought, for some reason, that this might change my mind.</p>

<p>Nick:</p>

<blockquote>First of all, the line about the Joker is sort of infuriating because that debate -- about whether comic book villains are more interesting than the heroes and what that means for the form, is long-running and actually an interesting conversation. But you wouldn&#39;t know that from him. </blockquote>

<p>Nor does he seem to understand the appeal of anti-heroes, <em>i.e.</em> why Batman and Wolverine will forever be more interesting than Superman and Captain America.</p>

<blockquote>Secondly the &quot;genius billionaire [who is] this total shit&quot; has been done many times before in comics. There is something original, I suppose in making that billionaire a loner villain rather than having him head an organization, but that too seems hardly original. </blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the real kicker: it&#39;s not original at all.  Off the top of my head—I have to run shortly, but I&#39;ll give this more thought and be back later—but I&#39;m guessing that Millar doesn&#39;t remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrath_%28comics%29" rel="nofollow">the Wrath</a>.  I mean, conceptually, they&#39;re identical.  More later.  </p></span>

<p>Be careful there. There&#39;s also an appeal to the neurotic and inhibited hero. Wolverine may have been my favorite of the X-men (partially because he blatantly got more creative and narrative attention from the writers than any other character) but my second favorite was Cyclops*.</p>

<p><i> I&#39;m guessing that Millar doesn&#39;t remember the Wrath.</i></p>

<p>Wow, I hadn&#39;t heard of the Wrath, but that does seem like the same idea.</p>

<p>Also, and this is bugging me way more than it should, Bruce Wayne isn&#39;t a billionaire. If you asked me to estimate the Wayne fortune I&#39;d guess something like $70-80M. I&#39;d believe twice that or half that, but I wouldn&#39;t believe 10 times that much and I certainly wouldn&#39;t believe 50 times that much. I&#39;ll concede, Tony Stark might be a billionaire, depending on which continuity you&#39;re thinking of, but Bruce Wayne isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>It bugs me partially because it&#39;s important to the character. Bruce Wayne gets invited to charity events but they&#39;re local. Maybe they&#39;re asking him for $10,000 towards a library or at the maximum $1M for a new hospital, but nobody would ask Bruce Wayne if he wanted to invest $10M in a new company.</p>

<p>He has a lot of money but it isn&#39;t unlimited. The batcave isn&#39;t the Avengers mansion, and it never will be.</p>

<p>But the real reason why it bugs me that Millar would describe a character as a &quot;genius billionaire&quot; is that it suggest someone who just doesn&#39;t care about scale in the world. I can only imagine that, for him, a billionaire is just &quot;cooler&quot; than a millionaire. </p>

<p>[Or, perhaps, his sense of scale is just altered by the fact that, as he mentions,  <i>Wanted</i> took in $350M. This is not an explanation that would make me feel any more sympathetic.]</p></span>

I mean his power is that something dangerous shoots out of his body all the time, and he has to be constantly vigilant about not letting it out of his control.</p>

<p>I remember thinking that the scene in the Dark Phoenix saga in which Jean Grey takes off his sunglasses was an admirably direct erotic gesture both metaphorically and not.</p>

<p>(and, again, I realize that this is all off topic. But perhaps it isn&#39;t since my recollection of the Ultimate X-Men is that Jean Grey just slept with Wolverine and Cyclops was mostly out of the picture. Which struck me as an unfortunate and ham handed re-writing of one of the inter-personal dynamics that I had found interesting the X-Men.)</p></span>

<p>I am never glad to be wrong, but I am happy to be corrected. I am sure that Gary Farber is right and that, in this case, my criticism of Mark Millar was unfounded.</p>

<p>It also reminds me that my knowledge of DC characters is even more dated than my overall comics knowledge. Which makes me curious, who was the financial backer for the JLA? If my memory serves me, didn&#39;t they have a space station at some point?</p></span>

<p>Yes, which Bruce Wayne paid for.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fair to say that if one were judging Batman by the Sixties version that one could fairly conclude what Nicks did, which is that Bruce was just a multi-millionaire.  Of course, that&#39;s all he was stated to be in those days.  </p>

<p>But times change, and by the Seventies and Eighties, Wayne Enterprises and all those Wayne Corporations, had grown to billion-dollar industries.  It made for bigger stories, and more scope for Batman to operate in.  </p>

<p>And, hey, it&#39;s not like it cost anyone anything to give him the bigger bux.  :-)</p>

<p>I just wanted to revisit that comment again. Since this is a mostly-dead thread, I will take the opportunity to make a mildly embarrassing confession -- Captain America is one of the very few comics to which I ever had a subscription. </p>

<p>In retrospect I&#39;m not entirely sure why I subscribed to it; you&#39;d have to say that Captain America was a solidly mid-quality title. It wasn&#39;t terrible, but it was never that good either. But there was something about the character that appealed to me. </p>

<p>Thinking about it in the context of this conversation I would say that Captain America is one of the few comic book characters who is fundamentally an adult, rather than an overgrown adolescent (and that isn&#39;t a complaint, I think that one of the things that comics do very well is to reflect adolescent emotional experiences). He&#39;s a character who, at his best, is emotionally present without tending to emotional extremes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure he&#39;s a tough character to write well. To often he just ended up standing around saying things that were essentially platitudes -- particularly in older issues of the Avengers. He&#39;s supposed to be emotionally grounded, a brilliant tactician, and leader and frequently those qualities are displayed through the not so effective technique of &quot;tell don&#39;t show.&quot; </p>

<p>But there were some stories in which you did get a sense of him as one of the genuine adults in the marvel universe. I remember the period when Captain Marvel (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Rambeau" rel="nofollow">Monica Rambeau</a>) was preparing to take over leadership of the Avengers, feeling very nervous about it, and leaned heavily on Captain America for support and it didn&#39;t feel heavy-handed. He seemed believably like a character who, for whatever he lacked in superpowers, was very good to have around.</p>

<p>I was thinking about this now because I just read the first volume of Alias (at the recommendation of the sidebar), and I was thinking about what it was that seemed off to me in that (brief) appearance by Captain America. </p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/03/shorter-jeff-goldstein.html"><span><strong>Shorter Jeff Goldstein</strong> It pisses me off that people I attack without cause think I’m a jerk. If my former professor didn’t want to be associated with what I’m writing now, he never should have worked with me then. His request to have his name removed my site is political censorship. OUTLAW! Goldstein’s old professor listed “a propensity for stifling opposition” as one of the reasons he wanted to distance himself from the site, but as Goldstein notes, that’s nonsense. Consider, for example, the condensed version of the rational arguments with which he and his commenters engaged my argument the other day: Scott is a cartoon, a hack; a clearly clueless and remarkably dishonest bracketing brackety bracketer who stands on the sidelines cheering while Lady Liberty takes it in the cornhole. This pretentious character is a lying cock, a fucking pussy, and a fucking retarded scrotumless fuck wearing a hot-pink thong, or maybe white lace boyshorts, and he would not stop a rape in progress, but would instead go home and be so turned-on he’d write a paper about it. Effete attention whores like Scott Eric Robespierre are routinely beat up by bread and, like all leftist twatwaffles lusting for power, he is a haughty apparatchik with a lisp and a pedo beard who couldn’t find cool were he to stumble pantless into a caribou orgy. He roots for the Mets and is truly a prick. Why wouldn’t an English professor want their name associated with the above? It’s a dazzling display of Oulipian restraint. After all, anyone can write a novel without the letter “e,” but writing in a way that attracts people who argue ad hominem and only ad hominem? That requires true literary talent.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/03/donald-douglas-somehow-managed-to-top-himself.html"><span><strong>Donald Douglas somehow managed to top himself. [Updated below the fold.]</strong> But honestly, because he’s proven it’s possible to be gainfully employed in academia and functionally illiterate, I can’t even manage a few moments of schadenfreude. Remember that post I wrote yesterday? The one in which I clearly indicated that I’d condensed a thread’s worth of insults into a nonsensical stream of ad hominem? Donald Douglas not only thinks Jeff Goldstein wrote it, he considers it to be a “deliciously devastating slam.” I’ll take the compliment on its face—the art of collage is an art—but the fact that someone employed by an institution of higher learning found that paragraph compelling is, I think we can all agree, probably the most embarrassing thing someone employed by an institution of higher learning could ever do. The only reasonable response to such a brazen display of idiocy is to take a screen-shot of it and put it on the internet forever: Click to embiggen. Update. Somehow, I always forget that when it comes to missing the point, Douglas will never be topped. He composed a &quot;refutation&quot; of this post in which he admits his error as only he can: The gist of the attack is that somehow I'm functionally illiterate: Because he’s proven it’s possible to be gainfully employed in academia and functionally illiterate, I can’t even manage a few moments of schadenfreude. Sure, to be fair to Skanky Little Scotty, my bad. I could have sworn that was Jeff's comments at the post, &quot;Shorter Jeff Goldstein.&quot; Chalk one up for the Big Bad Boys at Lawyers, Gays and Marriage, where academic giants like Robert Fuckwad Farley stiff good-faith conservatives for a thousand bucks while sucking back a few whiskey sours. As a Cautious Man noted earlier, someone is not aware of all internet traditions; he is, however, attempting to start one of his own. It lacks a catchy name like &quot;Shorter,&quot; but that doesn't mean it doesn't deserve a place in the Hall of Internet Traditions. It goes something like this: You demonstrate that Douglas has no idea what he's talking about. He responds by correcting a typo. I'm not kidding. He responded to a post in which I demonstrated that he has problems with basic comprehension by writing: Little Scotty's schtick is to attack conservatives for bad writing and alleged &quot;functional illiteracy&quot; while demonstrating—once again!—actual functional illiteracy. His proof? I mistyped &quot;version&quot; as &quot;verion&quot; in the &quot;Shorter&quot; post. I hate to be pedantic, but since winding Douglas up is damn entertaining, I will: making a typographical error isn't evidence of &quot;functional illiteracy,&quot; which Wikipedia defines as &quot;a term used to describe reading and writing skills that are inadequate to cope with the demands of everyday life,&quot; e.g. &quot;reading blog posts if you're a blogger.&quot; You're a blogger who by his own admission is incapable of reading blog posts, meaning that by the power vested in me by Wikipedia, I am within my rights to hereby declare you to be &quot;a functionally illiterate blogger.&quot; See how that works? Of course you don't. You...</span></a></div>
