				<p>THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO <a href="http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/newsstand/discussion/usa_today_angels_descend_on_fast_food_joint_for_late_snack/">TOLAXOR</a> (SCROLL DOWN TO COMMENT #8) IS HERE:</p>

<p>DID YOU KNOW WHY THEY CALL THEM WHITE CASTLES???</p>

<p>
THERE'S AN OBSCURE GREEK FABLE IN WHICH ARTEMIS ( THE VIRGIN GODDESS OF
THE MOON, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN) TAKES A FANCY
(DIRECT TRANSLATION) TO A YOUNG SPARTAN NAMED PHIL!!! </p>

<p>
EVERY NIGHT FOR A FORTNIGHT, ARTEMIS VISITS PHIL IN HIS HOVEL TEMPTING
HIM TO RETURN HER LOVE AND JOIN HIM IN THE SKY AS HER ETERNAL LOVER!!!
EACH NIGHT, PHIL THE SPARTAN DECLINES, AS HE'S ACTUALLY SECRETLY IN
LOVE WITH A HAIRY GREEK LADY NAMED APINE (PRONOUNCED APEEN) WHO,
HERSELF IS THE QUEEN OF THE GREAT KING OF THE ISLAND OF LIPSI, TIM!!!</p>

<p>
TIM, KING OF LIPSI, IS FABULOUSLY FAMOUS BECAUSE HIS ROYAL THRONE IS A GIANT BLUE AND WHITE CHAIR MADE OF MARBLE!!!</p>

<p>
ONE DAY, DURING A BULL-MATING FESTIVAL, PHIL FINALLY CATCHES THE EYE OF
APINE AS HE ATTEMPTS TO HAVE HIS BULL INSEMINATE THE KINGS FINEST
COW!!! THE FALL MADLY IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER, AND ELOPE TO A SMALL
UNINHABITED ISLAND NEARBY AND NAME IT THE PHIL-APINE ISLAND!!!</p>

<p>
OBVIOUSLY, THIS ENRAGES TIM!!! NIGHT AFTER NIGHT FOR A GOOD DAY OR TWO,
HE LOOKS UP INTO THE NIGHT SKY AND CURSES PHIL AND APINE FOR THEIR
ADULTERY!!! IT DOESN'T TAKE ARTEMIS LONG TO HEAR HIS ANGER AND COME TO
HIM WITH A PROPOSAL, IN EXCHANGE FOR HIM MAKING ARTEMIS A HUGE WHITE
TEMPLE ON THE ISLAND SHE WILL DAMN PHIL AND APINE FOREVER!!! TIM
AGREES, AND THE NEXT NIGHT, ARTEMIS HAS HER BROTHER APOLLO SCOOP THE
PHIL-APINE ISLAND OUT OF THE AGEAN AND HURL IT INTO THE SKY WHERE IT
STICKS AND BECOMES THE MORNING STAR!!! AS THE ISLAND STICKS, THE SKY
RAINS STEAMED ONIONS ACROSS THE AGEAN, IMMEDIATELY KILLING ALL
SHELLFISH (WHICH IS WHY THERE ARE NO SCALLOPS IN TURKEY TO THIS DAY)!!!
</p>

<p>
IN RETURN, TIM BUILDS A HUGE WHITE TEMPLE (CASTLE) IN TRIBUTE TO
ARTEMIS AND SCOOPS UP THE LEFTOVER STEAMED ONIONS AND BURNS THEM AT
NIGHT SO THAT THE AROMA OF THE TRIBUTE PYRE REACHES ARTEMIS AND PLEASES
HER!!!</p>

If y'all could take a minute to sign up with Frappr! and add yourself to the Acephalous group, I'd appreciate it. Much obliged. As for the rest . . . consider this an open thread. Talk about . . . whatever. I'm interested in what you have to say. [Edit III: If you added me as a friend, please go back and add yourself to my group. I had, in fact, created a group. Seems like it just took a day to show up.]</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/my_little_holbo.html"><span><strong>My Little Holbo Voice; or, Tonal Calisthenics II: This Time, It's Un-Caps-Locked</strong> With the exception of Saturday's commentorgy I take it people aren't too fond of STRANGE AND UNUSUAL POSTS. I LIKED THE ONE IN WHICH I YELLED. I think there's something to be said about the perception of literary voice and typography in the Internet Age. BUT YOU PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO THINK SO!!! (Don't worry. I still love you.) So let me rewrite last night's post as an examination of tone instead of an experiment in one. My reasons for pursuing this line of inquiry are varied, but they have to do with 1) my current dissertation chapter, 2) some interesting science fiction novels which've occupied the last week or so of Insomnia Theater, 3) the minnesota review article and 4) Don Delillo getting under my skin again. I can't count on you to have read S.W. Mitchell's Hugh Wynne, Free Quaker or Robert Charles Wilson's Spin and don't particularly feel like having the Delillo conversation again. (Michael does.) So I'll be a bad blogger and step into the realm of meta-blogging and ask you what I sound like: I know the tone I intend. I may even know how I create it. Only I don't know whether I'm successful. Or consistent. Or consistently successful. I can't judge its resemblence to my speaking voice either. Do I write like I talk? Do those of you who know me hear my voice in your head when you read my words? Do you do that automatically or do you have to remind yourself who's doing the talking? Or do I have a different voice entirely? (I am a man of many questions today.) What do I sound like? How old do I sound? Younger than I am? Older? More masculine? Less? Dialing down the solipsism: I have a Holbo voice. Everyone who reads him has his or her own. When I was at the MLA hanging out with the man himself, I acquired another Holbo voice, an amalgam of his actual with my imagined one. It persisted for a few weeks after the MLA. My Holbo voice is now the only Holbo voice I have. The other one has disappeared. Is that solely a function of the distinctiveness of his prose style? Or is it some combination of distinctiveness and repeated exposure? (Now you can see the blog angle.) Even stranger though is that when John sends me an email I &quot;hear&quot; a little something of his actual voice—the very one my Holbo voice has smothered—even though some of his emails are flat out Holbonic. What is happening here? Am I the only one that his happens to? Can someone point me to some secondary material which addresses these issues? MUCH OBLIGED IN ADVANCE PARDNERS!!!</span></a></div>
