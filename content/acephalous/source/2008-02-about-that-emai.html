<p>1.  From registrar@uci.edu:</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Kaufman,</p>

<p>It has come to our attention that you have apparently not registered for classes in the upcoming semester.  This is probably due to some registrations that inadvertently got lost in our computer system within the last month, so as a matter of policy we are reinstating anyone who replies to these warning Emails.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t reply, we will assume that you no longer wish to be a student at UCI.</p>

<p>Regards, [etc etc]</p>

<p>2. From library@uci.edu:</p>

<p>Mr. or Ms. Kaufman,</p>

<p>The Langston library has recently discovered an overpayment of your library fines.  According to our records, you are owed the amount of:</p>

<p>$2,000,002.34</p>

<p>in refunds.  This is a computer-generated message, <br />
and the amount calculated will be automatically<br />
deposited in your university account on reply.</p>

<p>Regards, [etc etc]</p>

<p>3.  From aliens@cygni.interstellarfederation.gov:</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>

<p>This Email message may appear to be a joke, but please read on.  To prove its bona fides, we have attached a file that contains an easily understandable cure for most human diseases -- show this file to any medically trained researcher and it will immediately become apparent that these cures will work, and could have only come from a non-terrestrial civilization.</p>

<p>Although it strains credulity, you have been contacted by such a civilization.  We don&#39;t expect you to believe this, but look at the file, and have a trained person look it.  That should convince you.</p>

<p>We can only expend the energy to insert this communication into your Internet system once.  If it succeeds, the file contains instructions for future, easy contact.  If it fails, your civilization will never again be contacted by us.  Unfortunately, we can&#39;t control the recipient of the message, but hope that whoever receives it will not let this chance, which will only happen once in the history of your planet, go to waste.</p>

<p>Very best regards, [etc etc]</p></span>

Dearest Colleagues, Today on the Internet I found a very reputable site indicating that a medical procedure impossible to perform prior to the discovery of antibiotics in 1928 may have been widespread in Victorian England. I was wondering if members of the list could point me to scholarly books, articles, dissertations, abstracts, indexes, bibliographies, errata sheets or, alternatively, contemporary newspaper clippings, fictional accounts, poems, songs, tragedies, diaries, daydreams, larks or fancies in which this procedure plays a vital part? In my forthcoming manuscript, I demonstrate gross ignorance of basic medical fact and speculate that Victorians could have performed this procedure, so any mention of it will confirm to my satisfaction the validity of my speculation. (Or, if not confirm, it will prove the procedure haunted the Victorian imagination by means of its terrifying potential, which for scholars of my caliber amounts to the same thing.) I would be particularly interested in accounts demonstrating the procedure not only done to beast and man, but from beast to man. Warmest Regards, Dr. Elderly Jew Deserving of Scorn</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/02/adventures-in-v.html"><span><strong>Adventures in Verisimilitude; or, Lacanian Variability on Film</strong> This Recording's ongoing coverage of HBO's In Treatment (episodes one, two, three and four) convinced me to give the show a spin yesterday. (The world itself had been reeling for hours thanks to a wicked ear infection.) The premise is deceptively dull: Gabriel Byrne is a psychotherapist. We watch his treatment of four patients. On Friday, he sees his therapist and we learn what he thought about them. So we have four days of his patients deceiving themselves and him deceiving us, then one day in which he reveals the nature and depth of his deception while deceiving himself. This constant contraction and expansion of the hermeneutic circle makes for some compelling television, though I wish the patient's problems had been more mundane. We don't need DRAMA! to pull us into these people's lives—our desire to understand these patients is instinctual (not to mention powerfully voyeuristic). But there is one slight problem with the show: Each episode is twenty-eight minutes long and begins shortly before the fifty-minute session begins. The only visible move from the patient's face to the therapist's and vice versa. Yet somehow almost an entire hour passes. Where do those other twenty-three minutes go? With the exception of the third episode, there are no discontinuous cuts: the conversation moves from one topic to the next until the patient asks if his or her time is up. If it is, Byrne's therapist informs them it's fifty-past and the session ends. But it can't be fifty-past—I started the episode not but twenty-eight minutes ago. The disconnect is inexplicably jarring. Physical. All of this must mean something now. Only it doesn't. We're left with the compelling desire to understand what we know and an overweening need to know more. Were the show not produced by the people responsible for Entourage, I'd be tempted to say the show enacts the &quot;punctuated signification&quot; behind Lacan's infamous &quot;sessions of variable length.&quot; From &quot;The Function and Field of Speech&quot; (1953): It is, therefore, a beneficent punctuation, one which confers its meaning on the subject's discourse. This is why the adjournment of a session—which according to present-day technique is simply a chronometric break and, as such, a matter of indifference to to the thread of the discourse—plays the part of a metric beat which has the full value of an actual intervention by the analyst for hastening the concluding moments. But did I mention this thing's produced by the people responsible for Entourage? Clever and revealing as that show (occasionally) is, the &quot;deftness&quot; with which In Treatment referenced Roland Barthes compels me to think these temporal shenanigans are the product of generic constraints. Yet the effect remains.</span></a></div>
