<p>I don&#39;t know which particular improbability is the camel&#39;s-back one, but the strength of this book is that it really got me to think about environmental probability in a different way.  Live in an area with a particular fire regime, and this kind of thing isn&#39;t improbable.  It&#39;s rather the opposite of improbable: it&#39;s inevitable.</p></span>

What they actually mean is that someone from your apartment complex knocks on your door and informs you that the fire department might have to evacuate you in less than five minutes, so anything you don't want burned alive (in the case of the cats) or to ashes (in the case of wedding photographs) should be right by the front door ready to run to the car. When someone reports this: &quot;The aircraft and the helicopters have been doing a pretty good job about keeping it from coming too close to these homes,&quot; said homeowner Warren Gillette. What they actually mean is that it'll sound like you're in the opening scene of a Vietnam film about to turn gruesome. I'm not sure what you think of when it sounds like air cav has arrived, but rest assured, the relentless buzzing of tankers and copters can unravel your core. I'd go to sleep, but I still need to figure out what my valuables are and find another cat carrier. I'm sure this will amount to nothing, but when it sounds like you're in a war zone, even things that amount to nothing rattle you insomniac.</span></a></div>

You would think that having lived in Southern California for a decade, I would be emotionally equipped to handle forest fires. I have, after all, dealt with them before. But those fires were &quot;in my vicinity,&quot; and the worst element of each was the effect the resulting air quality had on my wife's lungs. This fire, while not nearly so dangerous as those, was actually &quot;near me.&quot; I'm talking consider-the-view-from-my-apartment-near-me: I took that picture after returning home from the teaching gig that I have to wake up at 5 a.m. in order to commute to. I was informed that I might need to evacuate at a moment's notice at approximately 7:45 p.m. on Thursday. I started packing the car almost immediately, but kept having to sit down and force myself to breathe or I would've had a full-fledged panic attack (just in case you were wondering when I was on Facebook). Part of the panic emanated from your typical what-to-take debate: running around the apartment evaluating the relative worth of Item X versus Item Y. As the night progressed, however, I became increasingly concerned that my evaluations were too much about me. My wife is currently in Italy, where it was then currently the middle of the night. I became haunted by the possibility that I was selecting items of marginal value to me over items of intense value to her. So I started having to think like her—to look at our life through her eyes—the result of which was that I felt (and still feel) profoundly close to a sleeping woman half the world away.
