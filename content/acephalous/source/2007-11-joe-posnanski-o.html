				<blockquote><p>I didn’t hear “Born to Run”—the album—until I was in college.
And, like countless other kids, I listened to it over and over and over
again, even though none of the songs really spoke to me, not literally.
I don’t know anything about cars or the backstreets of the big city,
and I haven’t really been around too many people like Eddie or the
Magic Rat or the barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge (drinking
warm beer in the soft summer rain). I still have absolutely no idea
what Tenth Avenue Freeze Out is supposed to be about. I guess Bad
Scooter was searching for his groove.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t matter, not to me. There was something electric in
the music, something I NEEDED to hear at that moment in my life,
something I still love to hear, something about wanting to bust out and
make a name for yourself and just be heard, man. I was like most of my
friends, I had this nameless ambition to do something, be something,
but also this overriding suspicion that I was going to live a half life
with a dead-end, John Cusack, “I don’t want to sell anything bought or
processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or process anything sold,
bought or processed, or repair anything …” kind of job. Bruce shouted
down that fear. We’re gonna get to the place where we really wanna go
and then we’ll walk in the sun.</p>
<p>Other Bruce albums and songs through the years have had that sort of
impact on me—from my college days to my Dad days—they helped me
wallow in self pity some days and kicked me out of bed on others and
made me believe on other days. Again, I don’t think that it was the
words and music. It was something more than that, something that Nick
Hornby described once as “God walking into the song.” I just listened
to those Bruce songs so much that they triggered something in me. They
brought me closer to what lies underneath.</p>
<p>Even now, I don’t consider myself a Springsteen fanatic. My wife
thinks I am one, but I know those people. They are my friends. They
listen to imports. They travel around the country to see him. They can
tell you which version of “Badlands” is better—the one he recorded in
Philly or the one he did in Boston—and they know Springsteen songs
I’ve never heard of, and they know everything about Springsteen
himself. I don’t really know much about that. I don’t even remember the
lyrics to some of his songs I’ve heard 150 times. I just know how his
music makes me feel.</p>
<p>The other night, in a hotel room in Nagoya, I woke up at 5 a.m. with
my back shooting sparks of pain. I have never really had any back pain
before, certainly nothing like this, and I’m not going to lie to you—it scared the living hell out of me. I’m here in Japan, alone, I don’t
know anybody, I don’t speak the language, I had no earthly idea what to
do. I thought maybe I threw out my back. I thought maybe I was having
kidney stones (I have since talked to people who have had kidney stones—they assured me that I would have known without any doubt, so that,
oddly enough, made me feel better). I thought a lot of bad things
actually. The pain would not subside no matter where I went, no matter
how I sat or walked or laid down. It was pretty bad.</p>
<p>And then, finally, the pain eased. I still don’t know where it came
from or where it went—I’m not looking for theories either, I’m just
glad it’s gone—and I stretched out on the bed (because here the beds
are harder than the floors—that could have something to do with it)
and I put on my iPod and closed my eyes. I listened to my new favorite
Springsteen song, “Girls in Their Summer Clothes.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>A kid’s rubber ball smacks<br />
Off the gutter ‘neath the lamp light<br />
Big bank clock chimes<br />
Off got the sleepy front porch lights<br />
Downtown the stores alight as the evening’s underway<br />
Things’ been a little tight<br />
But I know they’re gonna turn my way</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And in an instant, I was back in America, back where everything
feels familiar, where the street lights shine down on Blessing Avenue,
and, I don’t know, everything felt all right again.</p>
<p>I don’t know if “Girls in Their Summer Clothes” is a “good” song as
far as that goes. Critics may hate it. Springsteen fans may think it’s
the worst song on the album. Music snobs may read this and realize that
they could never been my friend because this is the song I listened to
in a dark and lonely Japanese hotel room when I could barely move—I
mean, I really don’t know, hell, it may be the musical equivalent of
“According to Jim.” It doesn’t really matter though. I don’t think you
choose what music saves you. I think you just listen and feel lucky
that you found it.</p></blockquote>

I'm up for &quot;The Best of the Top 2501 - 3500 Blogs.&quot; I don't know what that means, but damn it, I want to win. (I wouldn't care, but I was nominated for this by one of literature's greatest minds and the sharpest of the New Critics.) (That and I must always win everything.) My competition consists of dull political linkers and a hippie. I'll whip the politicos no problem, but the hippie worries me, as he's damn talented. I'm hoping to ride my Winning of the Internets to victory here—should that prove impossible, I'll resort to begging and groveling. I'll alert you when the voting starts. (Remember: this isn't about me winning, it's about the hippie losing.)</span></a></div>
