the fact that KC knows me well enough (if only by reputation) to
personally say this is plausible—and despite the fact that I claimed <em>inconvenience</em>, not <em>harassment</em>—the same commenter decided he wants <a href="http://durhamwonderland.blogspot.com/2007/08/credentials.html#comment-8519163763689277725">answers</a>:</p><blockquote><p>What were the names of the conservative listservs in question?

and more often, you see this argument from the outraged fringes. They
turn their sense of disenfranchisement into a pointless crusade. 
Happens daily at <a href="http://patriotboy.blogspot.com/"><em>Jesus's General</em></a>.*&nbsp; Happened last week at <a href="http://confederateyankee.mu.nu/archives/238473.php"><em>Confederate Yankee</em></a>.&nbsp; But it won't happen to me.&nbsp; I stand partly on principle and partly on the impossibility of doing what they ask of me.**
</p>
<p>Whoever signed me up for these listservs used the acephalous (at)
gmail (dot) com address posted on my profile.&nbsp; What he or she didn't
know is that I don't use that address for private correspondence <em>and </em>that
I have another for online registration.&nbsp; The reason I don't use it for
private correspondence?&nbsp; I lost the password, so now I can only receive
mail sent to it via Outlook.&nbsp; Do you think this is too convenient?&nbsp; If
you don't believe me now, maybe you'll believe me <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2007/06/11/blogging-gets-results/">then</a>:</p>
<blockquote> <p>Anyone know how to get their Gmail password back if they've lost it? I
can still check that account through Thunderbird, but if this computer
ever crashes, it'll be gone for good. (And no, none of the &quot;recover
your password&quot; options have worked. Thing I hate about Google: no
people anywhere to answer even a simple question.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that I specified Mozilla's Thunderbird in that comment.&nbsp; I
lied.&nbsp; As anyone I've sent an email to can tell you, I use Outlook. 
(It's in the headers.)&nbsp; I didn't think that'd be relevant, so I tried
to keep my open-source street-cred intact.&nbsp; When I saw all the
Thunderbird-specific fixes, I lied <a href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/comments_5819.html#441686">again</a>:</p>
<blockquote> <p>Thanks! One down, one more to go. I have another old email, this one
from a former job, but it had to be through Outlook (company machine).
Same problem. Any suggestions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I never was able to recover the password.&nbsp; So I can't check the
Gmail archives for the names of all the listservs to which someone (or
someones) subscribed me.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And I can't check the &quot;Deleted Items&quot; because
I have it set to empty the &quot;Deleted Items&quot; folder whenever I close
Outlook.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And I can't check my browsing history because I have it set
to &quot;Always clear my private data&quot; when I close Firefox.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>I'm sure someone more technologically competent could retrieve this
information, but I've neither the time nor inclination.&nbsp; I've a chapter
due in two days.&nbsp; You'll pardon me if I prioritize that over a petty and pointless
crusade.&nbsp; </p>

<p>One last thing: AMac's proven himself a <em>mensch </em>in those <em>Durham-in-Wonderland </em>threads.&nbsp; From this point forward, I'm going to be a little more discriminating in my statements about KC's commentariat (as I should've been from the get-go).<br />
</p>
<p>*This seems like a suitable place inform new readers what my regulars know: I know from <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2007/06/11/blogging-gets-results/">online harassment</a>.</p>

<p>**You'll note I provided one of them accidentally, as it was the only one
I'd been unable to unsubscribe from this morning.&nbsp; I've since figured
out how.</p>

<p>In Memoriam S.E.K.</p>

<p>Thou wilt not leave us in the dust:<br />
Thou madest spam, we know not why,<br />
Spamblockers kill it on the fly<br />
But some gets through, it is unjust</p>

<p>Our little systems have their day<br />
And then they fail, and Email swarms<br />
It takes two hours to reform<br />
But what has happed to S.E.K?</p>

<p>Avast, these are but fools and slight<br />
We mock them and we do not fear<br />
They ask for proof, it is a smear;<br />
Help S.E.K. his diss to write</p>

<p>Forget these mad and scornful cries<br />
Confusions of a wasted youth;<br />
Forgive the wingnuts&#39; lack of truth<br />
And let indifference make you wise</p>

<p></p>

<p>(I can&#39;t wait for the cry -- wait a minute, I think that&#39;s familair -- I think he plagiarized Tennyson!)</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/some-good-news-.html"><span><strong>Some Good News on the Honesty Front</strong> I admit that as an academic, nothing bothers me more than plagiarism. I don't care where or why it happens, it always riles me up. (Despite my empowering of them.) When I found that this post had been plagiarized, I wrote another in which I mocked Onika (MAYOR OF SEXYTOWN!) for accepting praise for my work. Fair enough. Checking my mail—as always, I'm about a week behind—I find that the plagiarist herself wrote me. Here's her response: I just wanted to let you know that I apologize for using your blog. I got my ring stuck on my finger and came across it while I was looking for &quot;advice.&quot; I thought it was funny and I changed some stuff and posted it. I should have made it clearer that I took most of it from you but I really didn't think it was that big of a deal. People have taken things that I wrote and done this too. People have started to write me and implied that I steal your work all the time. I've never seen your blog before. Anyway, I'm sure you'll post this so everyone can laugh at what a shameful loser I am. So have fun. Hope everyone gets a good laugh. Despite the momentary wavering—&quot;I really didn't think it was that big of a deal&quot;—this is a refreshing admission of guilt. I'm constantly having that dread conversation with student plagiarists, in which I have their &quot;original&quot; work in one hand, and a hard-copy one of the first two returns in a Google search for the novel/play/poem I've assigned in the other. Not only will students refuse to admit what they've done, they'll babble complete nonsense like: &quot;What do you mean by exactly the same? Maybe this Henry James plagiarized me?&quot; &quot;'The first share of Charlotte Perkins Stetson's intellectual and professional indebtedness was undoubtedly to the Nationalist movement promulgated by Edward Bellamy and his 1887 novel Looking Backward' sounds like something I would write.&quot; &quot;Of course I know what it means: 'promulgated' means, like, to attack something a lot.&quot; So, Onika, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but we won't be laughing at you for having the guts to admit what you've done. The stakes may have been close to nil, but that makes it all the more admirable. You could've done what all those cowering students with they could've: run and hide. You didn't. That says a lot about you.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/why-yes-i-have-.html"><span><strong>Yes, I do have a Masters in Self-Victimization. Why do you ask?</strong> The aforementioned mensch writes: Sure, Kaufman might be a master of self-victimizing schemes. But look at his blog. Doesn't fit. Hate to disagree, but a good long gander at this blog strongly indicates otherwise. Since I began blogging, I've caught students having sex in my office and became entangled in a sexual harassment lawsuit. received death threats from an unstable and sorrowful troll who lives less than an hour away. been cyber-stalked by an insane sports writer from Wisconsin out to ruin my career. been accused of criminal pettiness for observing someone else's criminal pettiness. had that other thing happen in the comments thread of that other blog, which led to this, among other vile things. I've brought all this upon myself in two years. I may be the most successful self-victimizer the internet has even seen. I attract more (absurd) scandal in a week than the average blogger does in the course of his or her entire blogging career. I demand credit where it's due. I've worked hard, damn it, and deserve a cookie. I want my damn cookie. I demand a damn cookie. If someone don't give me one soon, someone is gonna find himself subscribed to a couple hundred more conservative listservs come morning.</span></a></div>
