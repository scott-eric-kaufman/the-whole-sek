<p>&quot;Storms of the Century&quot; are going to be relatively common.  As Bruce Sterling wrote recently with respect to global climate change, &quot;You are going to run out of denial before the world runs out of storms.&quot;</p>

		<span id="comment-9643332-content"><p>Rita has morphed in the past 24 hours from a tropical storm to a Category 4 hurricane .. and is expected to swell into a Category 5 later today as it barrels across the warm, energizing Gulf of Mexico. It remains aimed at Texas&#39; mid-coast, but moments ago Texas Gov. Rick Perry called for the voluntary evacuation of coastal areas from Beaumont to Corpus Christi; our own county and municipal authorities have also called for voluntary evacuation, with the option to make it mandatory in the next 24 hours.</p>

<p>Our protector at the moment is a high-pressure cell that&#39;s acting as a shield, driving Rita more southerly. If the high-pressure system passes through too quickly, our shield disappears and Rita can detour sharply north toward the Texas-Louisiana line ... us. Our best-case scenario, it seems, is that we&#39;ll endure Rita&#39;s outer bands of tropical storm-force winds and rain; worst-case is that she turns directly at us.</p>

<p>Relentless Rita churns ahead. One hurricane guru called the devastating difference between a Category 4 and 5 as the difference between being run over by an 18-wheeler or a freight train. One might be slightly less powerful than the other, but either way you&#39;re gonna have a really bad day.</p>

<p>The scenario we face now, to extend the analogy, is a freight train heading at you with a 400-mile running start.</p>

<p>Gas stations in some surrounding communities have already sold out. I saw long lines at bank ATMs this morning. If you&#39;re looking for a small generator, plywood to board your windows, lumber to buttress your home or other structures, bottled water, a hotel room within 100 miles ... you&#39;re already out of luck here.</p>

<p>The mood around the newsroom is a slightly more nervous than yesterday, but certainly not disabling. We&#39;ve begun to see how our focus might shift from our traditional paper-newspaper to our web site as a way to keep generating fresh, relevant news for readers who aren&#39;t here -- both local evacuees and curious outlanders who want to see what we&#39;re seeing. Our preparations are a mix of journalistic forethinking, gut reaction, and planning for the safety and comfort of our people who stay. We discuss how to power computers in a blackout, keys to the company snack bar, porta-johns in the warehouse, flexible and dynamic graphics that can be adjusted at the latest moment, who must stay and who can go ... if nothing else, we get a crash course -- on a very small scale -- of the difficulty of responding wisely, quickly and perfectly to a storm that could change course in the next hour and hit anywhere within about 500 miles.</p>

<p>Perhaps FEMA should be smarter about such things than a bunch of Texas newspaper wretches, but until you&#39;re casually chatting about life and death in the maw of a killer hurricane, you don&#39;t really understand how the processes become more urgent, confusing and haphazard. Many questions go unasked, leaving holes in our foresight and uneasy feelings.</p></span>

That this corruption scandal involves Jack Abramoff (former friend of the upstanding Grover Norquist) interests me less than the cultural politics involved in the various scandals. (Don't fret, children, I'll double back to the pornography momentarily.) Abramoff and Ralph Reed worked to shut down a lucrative Indian casino owned and operated by the Tigua tribe. &quot;We should continue to pile it on until the place is shuttered,&quot; he writes Reed. He refers to the Tiguas as monkeys, troglodytes and worse. (Lest you think I spout liberal propaganda, be informed that I borrow this information from Foxnews. They've reported, now I'm deciding.) Time passes. Abramoff convinces the Tigua tribe hire him as a consultant who can help them reopen the casino. (He is paid to close its doors. He is paid to open them.) He then convinces the board of the Eshkol Academy, a Jewish boys school he funded, to purchase life insurance policies on the Tigua elders. These moneys could be used to purchase an additional Zamboni to add to the rink-less school's growing collection. (The school had previously purchased two other Zambonis despite not owning a hockey rink.) It should be obvious to you that Eshkol Academy was, in the damning words of Abramoff himself, a &quot;front group.&quot; About that time Abramoff requested all future unnecessary donations from Native American tribes to his Zamboni-happy Hebrew school go directly through him: &quot;Please tell [the Native Americans] that we are 'using the school as our conduit for some of activities.'&quot; Why the tribes simply didn't donate another Zamboni is beyond me. By now they must have known the terrible truth that Jews love Zambonis. Their sultry Italian names remind wealthy Jews of forbidden thrusts in bombed out shiksa brothels. The thought of their shiny hulls resurfacing ice recalls some Old Testament obliteration of enemies of the wandering Jewish state. The Zamboni symbolizes the Jewish love of slates wiped clean and women whose touch corrupts. Or so you would think. It turns out Abramoff simply decided Native Americans didn't need Zambonis any more than he didn't, and that if it came down to who needed-it-less more, than the more less-needy party which deserved it was his own. And if they complained, his front company was the beneficiary of the Native Americans' life insurance policies. Just so this is all clear: a high-ranking Republican lobbyist was paid by one client to shut an Indian casino down, then by another another to reopen it. The funds from those fees (as well as direct donations) were then used to purchase Zambonis for a Hebrew school without a hockey rink. Some of them were also used to purchase life insurance policies on the elders of the Native American tribes whose casino had been closed and reopened by Abramoff and whose direct donations were used to purchase Zambonis. Perfectly intelligible. In addition to being bizarre beyond the telling, news of this colorful cultural...</span></a></div>

Twice looks like a grudge. Update: The Washington Post informs us that &quot;Rita Upgraded to 'Monster' Category 5 Hurricane.&quot; (CNN confirms.) Has the National Hurricane Center always applied such adjectives to hurricanes? Can one Category 5 be &quot;beastly&quot; and another &quot;indifferent&quot;? Or are all Category 5 hurricanes &quot;Monster&quot; by definition? (I kid, frankly, because I don't like the alternative emotional responses.)</span></a></div>
