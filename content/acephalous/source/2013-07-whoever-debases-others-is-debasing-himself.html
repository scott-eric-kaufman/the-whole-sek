They may not even be themselves. To wit: A few days later, another house was burglarized. The thieves made off with jewelry and a new laptop. Roofers working across the street had seen two black teenagers near the house at the time of the robbery. When they spotted one of the teens the next day, they called the police. This time, the roofers followed the suspect so he wouldn’t get away. The cops arrived and found the stolen laptop in his backpack. This was the same black teenager Zimmerman had seen looking in a neighbor’s window. I understand how the roofers could recognize one of the people they saw “near the house,” and that the police could positively identify him as one of the robbers because he’s in possession of stolen property. But how exactly does Coulter know that the black teenager arrested with the laptop is the same one Zimmerman saw? Especially given that—if nothing else—this trial’s proven that George Zimmerman is utter shit at identifying and assessing the relative threat of young black males. Given that this unnamed black teen was presumably convicted on the strength of the possession charge, from a legal standpoint it’s immaterial whether Zimmerman testified against him. But given the perspective of his current defense strategy—which amounts to him having been “socialized” by young black criminals to assume that all young black males are criminals—it seems odd that Coulter would defend Zimmerman by demonstrating that his profiling is vindicated. “He may be a racist who believes all young black males are criminals,” she essentially argues, “but Trayvon Martin was exception, and as a vigorously law-abiding citizen, Zimmerman had no choice but to abide by the rule.” And here—and the following is graphic and I advise you not to click through if such things disturb you—here is what happens when men like Zimmerman treat an “exception” like the “rule.” The defense has released countless images of a teenage Martin puffing his chest in his bathroom mirror like every other kid his age, but this is the image of Martin that matters. A young man, dead in the wet grass, his life cut short because Zimmerman mistook Skittles for a deadly weapon. The defense’s reliance on those images of Martin posing like a “thug” points to the perfidy of their logic: Zimmerman hadn’t seen those images when he started following Martin, nor did he know anything about Martin being involved with the insidious crime of enjoying marijuana. He just saw the kid who’d been in that dead body and decided he needed to be taught a lesson. Say what you will about the legal maneuvering about lesser charges, but it’s clear that Zimmerman’s guilty of a premeditated action, and if his defense manages to convince the jury that “sensible” racial animus..." />

			<p>Ann Coulter has <a href="http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2013-07-10.html">an interesting column</a>
 on the George Zimmerman case — and I say “interesting” because its sole
 concern is to indict Trayvon Martin for crimes committed by “young 
black males” who aren’t him. They may not even be themselves. To wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few days later, another house was burglarized. The 
thieves made off  with jewelry and a new laptop. Roofers working across 
the street had  seen two black teenagers near the house at the time of 
the robbery. When  they spotted one of the teens the next day, they 
called the police.</p>
<p>This time, the roofers followed the suspect so he wouldn’t get  away.
 The cops arrived and found the stolen laptop in his backpack. This  was
 the same black teenager Zimmerman had seen looking in a neighbor’s  
window.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand how the roofers could recognize one of the people they 
saw “near the house,” and that the police could positively identify him 
as one of the robbers because he’s in possession of stolen property. But
 how exactly does Coulter know that the black teenager arrested with the
 laptop is the same one Zimmerman saw? Especially given that—if <em>nothing </em>else—this trial’s proven that George Zimmerman is utter shit at 
identifying and assessing the relative threat of young black males. 
Given that this unnamed black teen was presumably convicted on the 
strength of the possession charge, from a legal standpoint it’s 
immaterial whether Zimmerman testified against him. But given the 
perspective of his current defense strategy—which amounts to him 
having been “socialized” by young black criminals to assume that all 
young black males are criminals—it seems odd that Coulter would defend
 Zimmerman by demonstrating that his profiling is vindicated. “He may be
 a racist who believes all young black males are criminals,” she 
essentially argues, “but Trayvon Martin was exception, and as a 
vigorously law-abiding citizen, Zimmerman had no choice but to abide by 
the rule.”</p>
<p>And here—and the following is graphic and I advise you not to click through if such things disturb you—here is what happens <a href="http://gawker.com/this-courtesy-of-msnbc-is-trayvon-martins-dead-body-753370712">when men like Zimmerman treat an “exception” like the “rule.”</a>
 The defense has released countless images of a teenage Martin puffing 
his chest in his bathroom mirror like every other kid his age, but 
this is the image of Martin that matters. A young man, dead in the wet 
grass, his life cut short because Zimmerman mistook Skittles for a 
deadly weapon. The defense’s reliance on those images of Martin posing 
like a “thug” points to the perfidy of their logic: Zimmerman hadn’t 
seen those images when he started following Martin, nor did he know 
anything about Martin being involved with the insidious crime of 
enjoying marijuana. He just saw the kid who’d been in that dead body and
 decided he needed to be taught a lesson.</p>
<p>Say what you will about the legal maneuvering about lesser charges, 
but it’s clear that Zimmerman’s guilty of a premeditated action, and if 
his defense manages to convince the jury that “sensible” racial animus 
trumps that, we’re all the poorer for it.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>And Zimmerman&#39;s <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/07/12/zimmerman-lawyer-closes-by-showing-jury-shirtless-trayvon-photo/">defense closes</a> with what Richard Wright, in a petulant interview with the French press, called a &quot;behold <em>this</em>
 nigger&quot; moment: a photograph of Martin sitting shirtless on his 
father&#39;s couch. It&#39;s just like a slave auction—right down to the 
selling of a black body.</p>

The movement's &quot;willing to make our voices heard even while being labeled kooks and 'fringe' elements,&quot; which is a good thing, since it sounds like something concocted by kooky fringe elements. Who are these people? Don't know. But according to Jeff they represent a growing number of contiguous outlying counties that surround the Denver/Boulder doughnut hole owned by the hipsters and Democrats, and the many out-of-state (and illegally out-of-country) imports who have taken over Colorado government, at least for the time being[.] I wonder what those counties have in common? Let me see now: Kit Carson - 94.8 percent white Logan - 92.2 percent white Morgan - 92.8 percent white Phillips - 96.9 percent white Sedgewick - 96.0 percent white Washington - 96.2 percent white Weld - 93.4 percent white Yuma - 97.5 percent white They &quot;represent&quot; a group wants to form a state that will be on average 94.94 percent white. They specifically want to exclude urban areas like Denver County, which threatens their Great White Fever Dream with its 10.4 percent blackness. Not that their desire for a white state prevents them from explicitly comparing their plight to the Civil Rights Movement. Except if you scroll down, you'll see that their new white state will require that &quot;the streets run with blood like we've never seen before.&quot; (That sounds ominous until you remember how low a benchmark that is for shut-ins like these.) So it'll be just like the Civil Rights Movement, only with lots of guns and violence. I bet Jeff's sitting at home right now thinking about rolling naked on the floor -- I mean grappling -- and choking the life from some dusky liberal relativist. Because there's nothing racist about wanting to create a white state if it's just an accident of ideology that everyone invested in its creation is white. Unrelatedly: *Stolen from a comment David Cross made when I saw him perform at the Irvine Spectrum Center many years ago.</span></a></div>

I could've saved myself quite a bit of hand-wringing had I these photographs at my disposal. They depict a young Adolf Hitler -- recently released from jail and fresh off writing Mein Kampf -- rehearsing the part of the &quot;Adolf Hitler.&quot; Because apparently Hitlers aren't born but made: And then there's the strangest of the batch: This is the face of evil.
