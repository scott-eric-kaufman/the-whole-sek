<p>I won't speak to any of that ... because I don't believe &quot;Chuck Adkins&quot; exists.&nbsp; He's a fictional character, confabulated by <a href="http://patterico.com/2007/12/11/douchebag-of-the-day-chuck-adkins/">irate conservatives</a> in desperate need of a straw man.&nbsp; How else could he embody the worst stereotypes of liberals and bloggers both?&nbsp; </p>

<p>There's a reason <a href="http://technorati.com/blogs/thepopulistblog.com/?reactions">everyone who links to his blog</a> does so with rage in their heart and violence on their mind.&nbsp; (As a future English professional, I see red every time he Capitalizes Words like a German.&nbsp; I know he thinks it's &quot;<a href="http://thepopulistblog.com/wordpress/2007/12/13/working-on-getting-posts-back/">Sort of Bad news</a>&quot; that he &quot;had to nuke the Blog,&quot; but if the news is &quot;Bad&quot; and the &quot;Blog&quot; is nuked, doesn't his illogic dictate the News of the Nuking also be capitalized?)&nbsp; </p>

<p><u><strong>Update:</strong></u>&nbsp; Hello to all the readers from ColdFury! <a href="http://thepopulistblog.com/2007/12/11/the-crybaby-fest-begins/" target="_blank">I’ve since posted a follow up</a>, <del>you

anyone over at Coldfury, ever. But yet, they’ll take pot shots at me,
well, they should expect stuff to be said back. It all goes back to
that “Every Action causes a reaction” kinda thing. Something that Mike
and his gang of illiterate thugs just cannot seem to understand.</del></p></blockquote>

<p>So I reach out to all the <a href="http://confederateyankee.mu.nu/">stalwart defenders of the really real</a>, <a href="http://patterico.com/">you who believe it your sacred duty</a> to <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/">reveal all the truths squirreled away by liberal media</a>
... I reach out to you and demand you prove that this &quot;man&quot; Adkins
breathes breaths outside the confines of fertile conservative
imaginations.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Because I don't buy it. </p>

<p>Yes, I am real.</p>

<p>Yes, I did make a mistake, and yes, I did apologize. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t get it. These people act like they want me to hang myself to god damn cross. </p>

<p>I mean, I think it&#39;s blatant Hypocrisy if you ask me. Ann Coulter can call 9/11 victim widows &quot;harpies&quot; and say that their husbands were going to divorce them anyhow, which is about as bad, and the Conservatives don&#39;t mind. But let someone who&#39;s a little left than these people say something and people act like you committed the unpardonable sin. </p>

<p>People need to get grip and move on, I said I was sorry, But it just ain&#39;t good enough. </p>

<p>Oh well, too bad. I&#39;ve got better things to do, than worry if some loser with Blog hates me or not. I&#39;m learning drupal, could lead to some income for me. </p>

<p>I dunno what to tell them.    </p>

<p>Ciao!</p>

		<span id="comment-93478384-content"><p>I have a question, Adkins: if you think Coulter is so reprehensible, why do you keep trying to slide by comparing what you did with her?  The fact is that where Coulter actually has a serious point in mind -- whether you approve of any of it or not -- you <i>didn&#39;t</i>.  You just took a rabbit-punch on something you didn&#39;t know anything about, for no other reason than to see it bleed.</p>

<p>None of this has anything to do with Coulter, Flubber-Boy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about the way you were <i>raised</i>.</p>

		<span id="comment-93480282-content"><p>Scott,</p>

<p>Hi.  Never read your blog before but I find it entertaining.  I scrolled down a few posts on the main page.  You&#39;re a good writer and entertaining, albeit a bit baffling at times.</p>

<p>I wondered the same thing as you: is someone who seems like such a caricature really for real, really?  I mean, really?!</p>

<p>But I think he is.</p>

<p>Are you deaf?  Serious question.  I think I saw a post on the main page that suggested you were.  Because I listened to a podcast of his last night, and it convinced me of Adkins&#39;s genuineness more than anything else I&#39;ve seen (or heard).</p>

<p>By the way, I tend to agree with him that he probably deserves to be left alone at this point, assuming he doesn&#39;t do anything else to provoke people.  (Pretty big assumption given his history.)  He does (finally!) seem to have issued a statement that does a pretty good imitation of a genuine apology.  (To other readers: it was left as an update on his original post -- which he has miraculously managed to resurrect -- today.  I&#39;m not referring to his previous half-assed apology which was immediately followed by a lot of whiny justifications.  This latest one is an actual fascimile of genuine contrition -- or at least someone finally self-aware enough to say the right things.)</p>

<p>Whether it&#39;s accepted or not is up to Mike Hendrix.  But I&#39;ll probably be laying off Chuck for now, unless he does anything to call more attention to himself again.</p>

<p>Anyway, fun blog you got here.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-93483770-content"><p>Scott,</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see any evidence that Mr. Adkins is a liberal. He&#39;s a political conservative -- TownHall.org affiliation and all -- and born-again Christian who takes issue with Republicans for not being sufficiently clear-headed (of which Mr. Adkins appears to be his own arbiter, on his own terms) and self-critical with regard to security, etc. He&#39;s one of a substantial number of conservative bloggers whose politics are a little hard to pin down because their disappointment with Republicans in power -- much like progressives&#39; disappointment with Democrats -- leads them to spend much time criticizing them for the same things liberals do. The difference, in both cases, is that what they want to see happen is quite the opposite of what the other side wants, but you won&#39;t be able to tell until they start talking about <i>solutions</i>, which is not most bloggers&#39; strong suit.</p>

<p>And he&#39;s a professional traffic-hound, sometimes referred to as a &quot;blog-whore,&quot; as evidenced by his relentless attacks, hyper-tagging of posts, and density of advertising. There was even one video that kept playing spontaneously, which I consider a gross violation of bloggerly standards. </p>

<p>He&#39;s not worth your puzzlement, honestly. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-93521578-content"><p>While the above is cute and giggly in a post modernist political labeling nyah, nyah, nyah kind of way, trying to pidgeonhole Chuckles on his political leanings is, ultimately, irrelevant.</p>

<p>Apparantly it takes some time and a firestorm of abuse before Chuck finally has enough self realization to post a genuine apology without 5 paragraphs of justification. A little late, but good on ya, Chuck! Liberal, Conservative, Progressive, Neocon; all have no meaning or purpose when a commentator attacks someone&#39;s dead spouse and sees that as a morally equivalent response to a criticism of one of his posts.</p>

<p>Hopefully (although past history does not provide a solid foundation of surety) Chuck will come to understand that his political and moral observations have no more weight or justification than most any other.</p>

<p>BTW: The &quot;Chuck is a liberal&quot; argument tends to explode when you consider that his post lauding the John Birch Society was the start of this sad, sorry affair.</p>

<p>Scott, you more than most know what it&#39;s like to be personally attacked for an honest opinion. Those who plow those fields deserve the light of intertube shaming.</p></span>

<p>He frankly seems to flip-flop from being an uber-lib to arch-&quot;conservative&quot; from month to month.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read a post where he&#39;s listing every conspiracy theory about Mormons, posts about how he hates Coulter, posts where he claims to be a republican, and posts where he claims he&#39;s never voted for a republican in his life.</p>

<p>I think the person that is Chuck exists, though part of me isn&#39;t sure all his posts are actually what he thinks, and not what he thinks will get a rise out of people.</p>

<p>However it ends up, what he said about Mike&#39;s wife was 100% out of bounds, no matter what his politics are.</p></span>

I can't thank this person enough. (Now I can review the series ass-to-elbows before the fifth season starts.) However, my anonymous benefactor had him a condition: You've been victimized by a well-intentioned system sagging under its own weight. No wonder you watch The Wire. But your Amazon wish list confuses me. [...] You own the second and fourth seasons but not the first and third? Have you not seen the first and third? You need to. [...] I'm sending you the first and third seasons on one condition: you tell me and the world why you've only watched the second and fourth seasons. Fail to do so and expect a visit from my man Omar. I wish I had a more interesting explanation. I've seen the first and third, but came to own the second and fourth under odd circumstances: My best friend from Baton Rouge came out to visit last month. He'd seen the first season. The second season was playing on HBO On Demand. Then it wasn't. So we trekked to Best Buy and he bought me the second season. The day before he left, the third season appeared On Demand. We watched until the wee hours of the night and then he went home. Two weeks later a package arrived on my stoop. My friend had ordered me a copy of the fourth season to thank me for putting him up. And that is how I came to own the second and fourth seasons of The Wire.</span></a></div>

The names and ethnicities of politicians strive to shock but elicit nothing but groans. There will never be a President Osama bin Reebok, III. Nor will &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; ever accompany Madame President Wendy Shorty-Muhammad into the corridors of power. I understand why science fiction writers want their future to reflect the marginal values of the present, but there will never be a President who sells half his name to a shoe company or spent her formative years in porn. (There might be a Muslim President one day, but years of poorly thought out speculative fiction make the name difficult to consider soberly.) Similarly, pharmacies of the future will not stock medication with names like &quot;Happitol&quot; or &quot;Blissbutrin.&quot; People will not ask their pharmacist whether &quot;Breathix&quot; is right for them, or what the recommended dosage of &quot;Muscledrine&quot; is. Medications will not be &quot;cleverly&quot; christened. Actual people don't need the Head-On Apply-Directly-to-the-Forehead approach to naming medications. Except apparently they do. Seems I'm wrong about the future. The present too, for that matter: On page 40 of the latest issue of Rolling Stone appears a phrase straight out of bad science fiction: &quot;President Barack Hussein Obama.&quot; A year ago that phrase would've clunked like so much speculative overkill. (&quot;A President whose name almost rhymes with 'Osama'? Not likely. We'll see Little Oral Annie in the Rose Garden first.&quot;) Page 41 of the latest issue of Rolling Stone consists entirely of an ad for Abilify, the latest and most ghastly named entrant into the already crowded field of antidepressants. (Possible side effects include &quot;an inner sense of restlessness or need to move,&quot; but be careful, because Abilify &quot;can affect your judgment and motor skills,&quot; so if you need to move avoid cars and heavy machinery. Don't ask anyone for a ride either, because Abilify may cause permanent abnormal and incontrollable facial movements that send people the wrong signal.) All of which is only to say that while the future may be now, it lacks imagination. It could've been so much better, if only we'd applied some Thought-On Directly Where It Reels ...</span></a></div>
