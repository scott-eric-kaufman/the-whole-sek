        <meta name="description" content="Johann Hari's review of Wolf: The Lives of Jack London suggests that its author, James Haley, says nothing about its subject that has not been long known.* The only people who would be surprised by the facts of Jack London's life and life of mind, then, are those who know nothing about him, like Ilya Somin, who uses the occasion of Hari's review to condemn the group he describes as &quot;early 20th century Progressives,&quot; claiming London’s simultaneous advocacy of racism and socialism was no anomaly among early 20th century Progressives. Was London a racist and a socialist? Absolutely. Did he believe in progress? He did. Did he align himself with the Progressives? He absolutely did not.** Not only did he despise the lukewarm commitment of populists like Williams Jenning Bryan to the socialist cause, he publicly quarreled with the Progressive Party's one and only Presidential candidate, Theodore Roosevelt, five years earlier, when the then President declared him a &quot;nature fakir&quot; after reading his account of a lynx killing a dog-wolf. Far from being a Progressive standard-bearer, London couldn't even agree with this lot about the finer points of dog psychology. The first problem with Somin's argument, then, is that he applies the term &quot;Progressive&quot; to someone who was an avowed &quot;Socialist.&quot; London was a capital-S Socialist who believed in lowercase-p progress, but he was not a capital-P Progressive. Teddy Roosevelt was a capital-P Progressive, but he didn't believe in progress and was neither a socialist nor a Socialist. These are distinctions with difference to everyone who cares more about history than contemporary politics. They must be made to obtain. The second problem with Somin's argument is that its logic lacks logic. Smudging your greasy fingers on the glasses of history only obscures your view of its record: The racist elements of Progressive ideology don’t prove that economic interventionism is racist by nature, or that the policies Progressives defended in large part on racist grounds can’t be justified in other ways. Still less do they prove that modern left-wingers are necessarily racist as well. But they do undercut claims that racism is primarily a product of the “right” and that economic leftism and racial progress necessarily go together. Proving that Jack London was a racist only proves that Jack London was a racist. It weakly suggests, and then only by extension, that those who shared his ideological commitment to socialism—which, it bears repeating, is only the same thing as Progressivism if you consider Teddy Roosevelt a socialist—might be racist. What it does not and can never prove is anything at all about people who were not London and did not share his beliefs.

			<p>Johann Hari&#39;s <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2261928/pagenum/all/">review</a> of <em>Wolf: The Lives of Jack London</em> suggests that its author, James Haley, says nothing about its subject  that has not been long known.*  The only people who would be <em>surprised</em> by the facts of Jack London&#39;s life and life of mind, then, are those  who know nothing about him, like Ilya Somin, who uses the occasion of  Hari&#39;s review <a href="http://volokh.com/2010/08/17/jack-london-racist-progressive/">to condemn</a> the group he describes as &quot;early 20th century Progressives,&quot; claiming</p>
<blockquote>
<p>London’s simultaneous advocacy of racism and socialism was no anomaly among early 20th century Progressives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was London a racist and a socialist?  Absolutely.  Did he believe in progress?  <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/accelerating-evolution-so.html">He did</a>.   Did he align himself with the Progressives?  He absolutely did not.**   Not only did he despise the lukewarm commitment of populists like  Williams Jenning Bryan to the socialist cause, he publicly quarreled  with the Progressive Party&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Party_%28United_States,_1912%29">one and only Presidential candidate</a>,  Theodore Roosevelt, five years earlier, when the then President  declared him a &quot;nature fakir&quot; after reading his account of a lynx  killing a dog-wolf.  Far from being a Progressive standard-bearer,  London couldn&#39;t even agree with this lot about the finer points of <em>dog psychology</em>.</p>
<p>The first problem with Somin&#39;s argument, then, is that he applies  the term &quot;Progressive&quot; to someone who was an avowed &quot;Socialist.&quot;  London  was a capital-<em>S</em> Socialist who believed in lowercase-<em>p</em> progress, but he was not a capital-<em>P </em>Progressive.  Teddy Roosevelt was a capital-<em>P</em> Progressive, but he didn&#39;t believe in progress and was neither a  socialist nor a Socialist.  These are distinctions with difference to  everyone who cares more about history than contemporary politics.  They  must be made to obtain.</p>
<p>The second problem with Somin&#39;s argument is that its logic lacks  logic.  Smudging your greasy fingers on the glasses of history only  obscures <em>your</em> view of its record:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Proving that Jack London was a racist only proves that Jack London  was a racist.  It weakly suggests, and then only by extension, that  those who shared his ideological commitment to <em>socialism</em>—which,  it bears repeating, is only the same thing as Progressivism if you  consider Teddy Roosevelt a socialist—might be racist.  What it does not  and can never prove is <em>anything at all about people who were not London and did not share his beliefs</em>.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks otherwise was likely also impressed by Jonah Goldberg&#39;s masterful <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/i-recognize-i-c.html"><em>Liberal Fascism: Two Words Next To Each Other</em></a>, and deserves to be taken about as a seriously.</p>
<p>*Part of the reason that the details of London&#39;s life are already  familiar is that, as he wrote S.S. McClure at the beginning of his  career, “[he] took the facts of life . . . added to them many other  facts of life gained from other sources, and made, or attempted to make,  a piece of literature out of them” (10 April 1906).  Be it in the Yukon  stories of <em>The Son of the Wolf</em> (1903), his time among the English poor in <em>The People of the Abyss</em> (1903), his <em>Tales of the Fish Patrol</em> (1905), his account of <em>The Cruise of the Snark</em> (1913), or his struggles with <em>John Barleycorn</em> (1913), Jack London made certain the world knew &quot;the facts of [his]  life.&quot;  Moreover, his compulsion to rewrite the narrative of his  intellectual development, as manifested in <em>The Sea-Wolf</em> (1904), <em>The Iron Heel</em> (1908), and <em>Martin Eden</em> (1913), always included an oblique, but still extensive, bibliography of the &quot;other sources&quot; that inspired his philosophy.</p>
<p>**The closest he came were a few late-in-life publications in a magazine called <em>The Progressive</em>.</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01348669ab6b970c-content"><p>I have been making a nuisance of myself about this, but anyway:</p>

<p>1. Bryan was a Democrat, not a Populist. In 1896 he was endorsed by the Populists, but he didn&#39;t even acknowledge the endorsement. By contrast, Clarence Darrow, Bryan&#39;s opponent in the Scopes trial, had been an active Populist. The Populist Party had a significant socialist wing, many of whom ended up in the Socialist Party, for example Debs. </p>

<p>2. The term progressive means all kinds of overlapping things: 1912 Progressives, 1924 Progressives, 1948 Progressives, Prairie Progressives, Wisconsin Progressives, and the all-important Other Progressives. Many Progressives worked within one of the major Parties in defiance of the national leadership, usually the Republican Party.  But you are correct that London was probably none of these. </p>

<p>3. In 1912 Roosevelt left the Republican Party to form a new party. He had the same kind of relation to the Progressives as Bryan did to the Populists, and LaFollette, who hd been the Progressive leader, did not support him (and Wisconsin voted for Wilson.) LaFollette ran in 1924 and got 17% compared to Roosevelt&#39;s 27% in 1912.</p>

<p>4. While the Populist Party was around the Populists  and the Progressives were not necessarily friendly, but as time went on Progressives absorbed a lot of Populist support and probably some Socialist support. </p>

<p>5. Bonus: The Republican Progressive Fiorello LaGuardia, legendary mayor of NYC, was half Jewish and half Italian atheist, and he was raised as an Episcopalian in Arizona. His mother  is buried in the Jewish cemetery in Budapest.</p>

<p>6. Governor Floyd B Olson of the Minnesota Farmer Labor Party grew up in a Jewish neighborhood and spoke Yiddish.</p>

<p>You did, and I recognized it, but I wanted to broaden the discussion of racial ideology, because the conditional in isolation still presents an imbalanced picture. Which was Somin&#39;s intent, of course, as with Goldberg. Goldberg, it should be noted, really wasn&#39;t being all that original, either: USENET discussions were full of that kind of crap for years before he compiled it into a book and got blurbs and symposia.</p></span>

<p>The racist elements of Progressive ideology don’t prove that economic interventionism is racist by nature, or that the policies Progressives defended in large part on racist grounds can’t be justified in other ways.</p>

<p>Of course &quot;economic interventionism isn&#39;t racist by nature.&quot;  All states intervene in markets. Markets are the product of corporate action since law, by its nature, is the product of corporate/state/communal agreements and enforcements.  If those laws are race neutral, be they however interventionist, they aren&#39;t &quot;racist by nature.&quot;  Unless, of course, you are subscribing to the argument I thought righties hated that unequal outcomes that are overwhelmingly racial in character can be understood as racist in origin.  </p>

<p>But I guess I&#39;m interested in the phrase &quot;defended on other grounds.&quot;  If Racism wasn&#39;t necessary to London&#39;s political and economic program what was it doing there?  What was its function?  Just pure meanness?  Is that what&#39;s wrong with Racism?  What&#39;s the problem with London&#39;s racism that isn&#39;t identical to, say, Buckley&#39;s racism?  </p>

<p>The unspoken word here is class.  It seems to me that London&#39;s  anti Chinese Racism which is pro-white-working class is infringing on the rights of the ownership class to get cheap labor, while Buckley&#39;s racism is explicitly designed to keep Blacks in a subordinate but functioning position as workers.</p>

<p>But I have to remember I haven&#39;t read much London for a long, long time.</p>

<p>This is part of the story, but by no means all of it: London spent time in Japan and China, and while there acquired a respect for the former but his disdain for the latter--Californians being none too enamored of Chinese laborers--hardly changed.  His thoughts on African-Americans were complicated, but by no means <em>wholly</em> racist, though as a Californian he didn&#39;t share Northerners&#39; enmity for them on the basis of class competition.</p>

<p>Let me formulate a more thoughtful response and post it later, as I&#39;m a bit muddleheaded at the moment. </p></span>

It opens with a lament: Having worked for a very long time with moderate Muslims, I can tell you it’s disheartening to be called an Islamophobe. Then demonstrates that that epithet, along with a few others, is well-deserved: I have long argued that: (1) Islam is not a moderate doctrine; (2) Islamists who practice terror and are otherwise aggressive toward non-Muslims (and toward Muslims who disagree with them) are not twisting or perverting Islam; (3) this does not mean that the Islamist interpretation of Islam is the only possible viable interpretation; but (4) a concrete theology of “moderate Islam” does not exist (even though there are plenty of moderate Muslims) and therefore it will have to be created; and (5) because it will have to be non-literal and reformist, it will have a tough time competing with Islamist ideology which, however noxious it may be, has the advantage of being firmly rooted in Islamic scripture. Nevertheless, (6) Islamist ideology is anti-constitutional and anti-freedom in many of its core particulars, so that (7) if, instead of letting them pretend to be “moderates,” we force Islamists to defend their beliefs, we will marginalize them—at least in our society, which (8) will empower true moderate Muslim reformers and—maybe—give them the space they need to solidify a coherent, moderate Islam that embraces the West, and in particular the separation of secular public life from privately held religious beliefs. If &quot;Islam is not a moderate doctrine,&quot; how is it that he has &quot;worked for a very long time with moderate Muslims&quot;? How can McCarthy distinguish between &quot;moderate Muslims&quot; like his coworkers and those Muslims who merely &quot;pretend to be 'moderate'&quot;? Where does he believe these &quot;moderate Muslims&quot; come from? Are they Amabo—secret Christians pretending to be Muslim—whose moderate views are the result of never reading the Koran or attending services at a mosque or keeping halal? McCarthy attempts to dismiss such questions in a parenthetical of dubious explanatory power: a concrete theology of 'moderate Islam' does not exist (even though there are plenty of moderate Muslims) and therefore it will have to be created[.] Granting their existence in an aside is purely strategic—if he fails to do so, he will be disheartened again, so he grants their existence, then explains all the many ways in which people like them can never come to exist. It's the political equivalent of holding up a duck and beaver; explaining that no matter how much you coax them, they refuse to fuck; then astonishing the crowd by pulling a duck-billed platypus out of your hat. You have no idea how that strange beast came to be, nor are you interested—all you want to do is prove that ducks never fuck beavers. Which is an admirable goal, I suppose, if you want to tell the world that your lack of intellectual curiosity is matched in its profundity only by the pride you take in being ignorant. The ultimate irony, of course, is his claim that...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/08/everything-in-the-chrysanthemum-and-the-sword-that-pertains-to-neither-chrysanthemum-nor-swords.html"><span><strong>Everything in &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword&quot; that pertains to neither chrysanthemum nor swords.</strong> I can't counter Lemieux's endorsement of Matt Zoller Seitz's recap of &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword,&quot; but I would like to register my annoyance with Seitz for setting the bar so high. Particularly annoying is the fact that Seitz discussed at length the most salient visual element of this episode, i.e. &quot;the interplay of close-ups and wide shots on the show, specifically how the camera will start very close on characters' faces, encouraging our empathy, then slowly dollying back to put them in a context.&quot; I noted this dynamic in my analysis of Peggy and Pete in &quot;The Rejected,&quot; but Lesli Linka Glatter structured the entirety of &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword&quot; around it. The one point on which I'll differ with Seitz (and Jefferson Robbins, whose work Seitz discusses there) is that with characters who are unaware of the larger context, the shots often begin wide before moving in for a close-up. When, for example, Sally cuts her hair, the scene does open with a close-up, but not one that encourages empathy: Glatter, having established the true object of the characters' attention, then pulls back behind the couch in order to create a space for Sally to enter: While it may seem as if the shot that follows works to establish empathy, the logic of the scene makes me think the decision to go with the close-up here is more pragmatic, as viewers would be unable to tell from a remove that Sally had lopped off her hair: I say that because after this close-up, the Glatter isolates her for while the babysitter frets about Don holding her responsible for Sally's actions: When the camera does return to a close-up, it does so not to create sympathy, but almost ironically: not for the last time this episode, Sally will have unwittingly done something that will cause someone else grief. The close-up emphasizes its own futility, as it demonstrates the distance between Sally and her interlocutor, be it her babysitter, her father, her mother or the man from U.N.C.L.E.: This scene will surely draw the ire (not to mention critical attention) of many, but instead of focusing on the rather tame thematic element—it turns out that even if they never watch an episode of Jersey Shore, children still experiment with their sexuality—I want to concentrate on the intimacy actually created by these shots. (If only to contradict myself a bit.) This moment of centering the shot on the television differs from the previous because it cuts to the following close-up: Unlike before, where the shot following the television pulled back, indicating a lack of total engagement with the image on the screen, here Glatter shows viewers that Sally is finally connecting with someone, albeit someone on a television screen. Her brother and their sitter passed time passively watching a cartoon, but for reasons the show has made plain, Sally is in desperate need of someone who can restore a sense (however imagined) of security to her world. Glatter provides her...</span></a></div>
