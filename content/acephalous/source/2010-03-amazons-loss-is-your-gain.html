<p>Because they&#39;re 1,000 pages long, hard-bound, printed on glossy paper, and contain introductions by the authors.  For example, the <em>Captain Britain Omnibus</em> I bought awhile back weighs much more than the 4.7 lbs. it&#39;s listed as.  Seriously, under $10 for a book like that is a steal ... which is why it&#39;s probably a glitch that&#39;ll be corrected any moment now.  Get &#39;em while they&#39;re fresh!  (For the record, I ordered the <em>Wolverine Omnibus</em> for the Barry Windsor-Smith and Frank Miller material; the Brubaker <em>Daredevil Omnibus</em> because it&#39;s one of the only hero-books nominated for an Eisner that legitimately deserved it; and a few other early Kirby books because my knowledge of that period is woefully inadequate.  (With the exception of the <em>X-Men</em> material they reprinted as <em>Classic X-Men</em> when I was growing up.)</p></span>

<p>As long as you actually completed the order before the fix, you&#39;re probably OK. I&#39;ve heard of cases where the price changed between the initial selection and checkout. But you should be able to check your order status and see. </p>

<p>If I were Amazon, I&#39;ve have some kind of webcrawler or google alert looking for phrases like &quot;order before they notice&quot;..... any odd traffic between posting and now?</p></span>

<p>Not really.  It&#39;s amazing what actual, copyrighted photographs and Photoshop can accomplish.</p>

<p>Yes, but all of it&#39;s <em>Avatar</em>-related, so I think I&#39;m in the clear.  That said, it was actually an Amazon alert on Brubaker book that informed me of this wonky pricing, so when you think about it, they&#39;ve only themselves to blame.</p></span>

<p>Five.  Whole.  Days.  And now, for the rest of his life, his patriotism can never be questioned.  Would that you and I could speak truth to power, and inform the world that, well:</p>

<p><em>Contrary to what one hears, these guys are so oversupplied with armor, they leave some of it on base so they can maneuver effectively on patrol, whether body armor or Humvee armor.</em></p>

<p>Can you imagine how many American dollars we could save if we just didn&#39;t send all that unnecessary armor to troops in the field?  We could solve the deficit in, wait, hold on a second, I need to throw up in our mouths again ...</p>

<p>... he really is a vile fuck, isn&#39;t he?</p></span>

Yeah I got no jokes to make on that one. Gross. Dude sure seemed to learn a lot in just five short days. I wish I could figure out how to make so many observations out of such a short span of time, it would make research a whole lot easier. I&#39;m sure my lack of efficiency is tied to my leftist views somehow.<br />

To wit: If I wanted to write &quot;a man who explains, in iambs, why he came to her aid and why he is about murders them,&quot; I would've written that instead of &quot;they are murdered by a man who explains, in iambs, why he came to her aid and why he is about to blow up the British Parliament.&quot; Moreover, you'd think something specifically designed to check for &quot;Spelling and Grammar&quot; errors would've noticed that I seem to be out words before the colon up there (what with V for Vendetta being set in &quot;a dystopian future,&quot; not &quot;a dystopian&quot;).</span></a></div>

It's neither finished nor particularly good, but turning stacks of virtual notes into viable prose is a messy process and what's the point of even having a blog if you can't ask your readers to help straighten up your mess? It ends rather abruptly because I need to mark essays, but rest assured, it will arrive at the obvious destination soon enough.) The inaugural issue of the British comic anthology Warrior, published in March of 1982, contained two stories scripted by a 29-year-old Alan Moore that could not have been more different in tone or conception. The first told the story of an attempted rape in a dystopian future: corrupt police accost a young woman, but before they can rape her, they are murdered by a man who explains, in iambs, why he came to her aid and why he is about to blow up the British Parliament. In stark contrast to the opening chapter of V for Vendetta, Moore’s second contribution comes from “an age of lingering innocence, an age of golden dreams,” and recounts how, in 1956, “the Miracleman Family” repelled the invasion of a terrorist organization from the future called the “Science Gestapo.” These serialized stories represent two possible career paths for young Moore: he can become a writer who creates and develops original ideas, as he does in V for Vendetta; or he can become the kind of whose genius is particular to comics, i.e. one whose talent lies in the ability to transform a caricature into a character of compelling psychological depth. (Characters in mainstream comic books are, after all, a form of communal property: they belong to a company, and are subject to regular refashioning and repurposing.) Although its cartoonish art and quaint language could hardly differ more from the harsh lines and sharp tongues of V for Vendetta, the final eight panels of the Miracleman story depict the process that, over the course of the decade, will become Moore’s signature style. Reunited after preventing the “Science Gestapo” from traveling to the past by defeating them in the future, the Miracleman clan shares a laugh: “S-so…Garrer was never here, because he never left 1981! It sounds unbelievable,” says Kid Miracleman. “Maybe so, Kid,” Miracleman responds, “But that’s the way it was…or was it?” As they laugh, the focus shifts from the family to Miracleman alone and the narrator, whose role up to this point had been providing linguistic gristle for the duo-specific word-picture relations—in which the words and the pictures say the same thing, as in books designed to teach children to read—begins quoting an ominous-sounding passage from Nietzsche: The shift from duo-specific to interdependent word-picture relations—in which the combination of the words and pictures accomplish together what neither could alone—marks a transition from a childish, if educational, redundancy to a more rhetorically sophisticated intersection of word and picture.
