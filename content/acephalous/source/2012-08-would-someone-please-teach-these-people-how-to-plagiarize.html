Today he is standing in the checkout line. In front of him is a very large, very genial black WOMAN unloading eighteen loaves of white bread and half a dozen cases of Coke onto the conveyor belt. WOMAN: (singing under her breath) Breakdown, uh takedown, shakedown, everybody wants into uh crowded line ... SEK looks at her perplexedly. She removes yet another case of Coke from her clown car of a shopping cart and places it on the conveyor belt. WOMAN: (still singing under her breath) Breakdown, uh takedown ... SEK looks at her. She looks at SEK. WOMAN: (like she's Praising The Lord) YOU BUSTED! EVERYONE ELSE IN THE STORE turns to see who's been busted doing what. SEK would say something but he's trying too hard not to laugh. WOMAN: Well, you is. (her hands become little pistols miming Bang Bang Bang as she belts out) YOU BUSTED!</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/08/a-parable.html"><span><strong>A parable</strong> It's fourth down and seven with two outs in the bottom of the ninth of the Super Bowl of Sport. COACH ROMNEY calls a timeout. COACH ROMNEY: Brees, I'm going to have to take you out. DREW BREES: Why Coach? I'm just about throw a strike-out on the winning drive! COACH ROMNEY: I know you throw your throws at the appropriate height, but this is just too important. We need to be winning this sport. DREW BREES: But I am winning it! COACH ROMNEY: I mean we need to be winning it. (Sends BREES to the bench and signals to the bullpen. Enter TIM TEBOW.) I trust you know what to do with this. TIM TEBOW: Run it to left outfield for a touchdown! COACH ROMNEY: Exactly. Let's go win this sport! TIM TEBOW: Jesus Christ! JESUS CHRIST: I want no part in this. COACH ROMNEY: Of course you do. You're our new power forward! JESUS CHRIST: Jesus Christ. TIM TEBOW: Jesus Christ! How will the World Series of Sport end? I don't know either. But I guarantee it'll be entertaining.</span></a></div>
