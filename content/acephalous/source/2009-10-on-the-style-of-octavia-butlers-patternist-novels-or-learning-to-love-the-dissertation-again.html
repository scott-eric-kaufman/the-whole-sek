In Wild Seed, Butler wed her characters to her prose, such that the latter's stolidity became evidence of the former's hard-fought restraint. (It is, after all, a novel about two people who spend their unnaturally long lives finding excuses not to murder each other.) She did so deliberately because, at this point in her career, she could.

Amalgam would have it), such a feat would be beyond her; but comparing the occasionally dense and ornate prose in Wild Seed (which shares formal concerns and historical content with 1979's Kindred) to the more direct, straightforward prose of Clay's Ark—written nearly half a decade later—it is difficult to imagine that the latter's resemblance to Patternmaster is anything other than intentional. When she was young, she couldn't help but write of the future in spare and quotidian manner; but by 1984, she could adopt a transitional voice, something that approximates in complexity the difference between 1977's Mind of My Mind and 1976's Patternmaster. While it may seem odd to call attention to the refinement of her narrative voice, it is essential to understanding the refinement of the thought processes it develops alongside: the series is unusual in that, as Butler said, she invented a society that was conceptually fascinating, but instead of going on to invent another, she became interested in how that one could possibly have come..." />

I certainly wasn&#39;t bothered by the prose--it just seemed to me like straightforward YA-level diction and syntax, but nothing obviously maladroit about it. What you say about her shaping her style to fit the internal chronology of the books is fascinating, though. I&#39;m looking forward to reading the others.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a630d248970c-content"><p>I still think that&#39;s the place to start with the <em>Patternist</em> series.*  There&#39;s something to be said for knowing the outcome before seeing the process, since the series is dedicated to exploring the development of the latter.  I&#39;d recommend going to <em>Wild See</em>, then moving through the narrative instead of chronological progression.  (I will, however, most likely change my mind on this tomorrow, when I&#39;ll likely have finished re-reading <em>Mind of My Mind</em>.)</p>

<p><em>it just seemed to me like straightforward YA-level diction and syntax, but nothing obviously maladroit about it. </em></p>

<p>The comparison to Dick is a bit muddled, but the thickness of it isn&#39;t mine -- someone else made it without realizing that, at its worst, Butler&#39;s prose is pedestrian whereas Dick&#39;s, at its worst, openly offends literary sensibilities.  </p>

<p>*Note to self: Do you italicize the name of a series when it&#39;s not the title of a work in it?  The <em>MLA Handbook</em> treats &quot;series&quot; to mean stuff like &quot;Topics in English Linguistics,&quot; and says no italics/underline.</p></span>

<p>Definitely Obama.  You can tell by the way they both use the words &quot;black,&quot; &quot;education,&quot; &quot;the,&quot; and &quot;of.&quot;  So, like I said, definitely Ayers.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Modern Language Association&quot; aka the people who ruined footnotes.</em></p>

<p>You should&#39;ve seen the look on a committee member&#39;s face when I tried to argue for the superiority of Chicago . . . actually, you probably have: just look in the mirror when you encounter something written in MLA format and there it is.</p>

<p><em>Um, use a plain text editor as a go-between. Say Notepad, or TextEdit, or gedit.</em></p>

<p>Then I lose all the formatting, and have to re-do it by hand.  It&#39;d actually be faster for me to re-type and incorporate HTML on the fly, but that&#39;s still awful tedious.  Really, the only reason I&#39;m complaining is that I used to be able to Ctrl-v into the TypePad rich text editor but can&#39;t anymore.  Same with Wordpress and Blogger, for that matter.  It&#39;s really just my annoyance that their version of an &quot;upgrade&quot; makes my life that much more difficult.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Dickian hack&quot;?</em></p>

<p>Sorry, I&#39;d hoped my shorthand would be understand: the complaint made against Butler---and sci fi generally---usually comes from some asthete who&#39;s had a friend push one of the clumsier Philip K. Dick books on them.  I don&#39;t buy that Dick was a hack <em>per se</em>, but his prose was frequently outstripped by his need to get ideas down, and he was, by admission, inimical to revision-for-style.  If he changed his mind about the execution of an idea, he would rewrite and pay more attention to his prose, but he wouldn&#39;t rewrite solely because of this awkward series of sentences or clumsy tonal shifts.  &quot;My readers won&#39;t notice, and if they do, they won&#39;t care, because that&#39;s not why they read me&quot; captures his approach.  (That&#39;s not an actual quotation, for the record, just me summarizing his position.)</p></span>

Gladwell decided to write an article on violence in the National Football Leauge, went to his editor with his Vick-topical article and was told to run with it. The problem, of course, is that the entire article boils down to this question: Is [football] dogfighting or is it stock-car racing? And that question, I think we can agree, makes little sense for the simple reason that its analogy isn’t analogous. I know that blunt counterintuitive statements are a hallmark of literary journalism, but they need to be founded on something more substantial than this: [I]s the kind of [tau deposit-induced dementia] being uncovered by McKee and Omalu [in former NFL players] incidental to the game of football or inherent in it? Part of what makes dogfighting so repulsive is the understanding that violence and injury cannot be removed from the sport. It’s a feature of the sport that dogs almost always get hurt. Something like stock-car racing, by contrast, is dangerous, but not unavoidably so. The relevant analogy is right there—preventable injuries in Nascar versus the NFL—but had Gladwell went with that, he would have to ditch the dogfighting angle.* The problem, then, is that the once venerable New Yorker would rather be clever and topical than deeply informative. Consider, for example, the career of the go-to literary journalist for me and Ari, John McPhee. His first book was about A Sense of Where You Are, was about the professional basketball player, long-tenured Senator and former Presidential candidate Bill Bradley, but was written before Bradley graduated from Princeton. McPhee did a superlative job outlining what would make Bradley successful, but he didn’t write about him because the New Yorker wanted an article about the Senatorial or Presidential candidate. Similarly, after Katrina the magazine saw fit to print McPhee’s brilliant (and to my students, hilariously unpronounceable) essay “Atchafalaya,” which was first published in in 1987, long before most people outside of Louisiana cared about the state of the levees. My point, as you probably guessed, is that the odds of the New Yorker dipping into their archives and pulling out a Gladwell essay on the strength of its reporting or the depth of its intelligence decrease with every superficially clever, patently topical article they allow him to write and consent to publish. This isn’t to say that Gladwell is incapable of strong reportage or intellectual depth—only that that people can’t seem to convince him to slow down and write something with heft enough to be as relevant twenty years down the line as it is this week. *I have nothing against clever analogies when they actually, you know, work. My friend Barry Siegel combined a thrilling narrative of a crashing B29 and a legal case that led to . . . something...</span></a></div>
