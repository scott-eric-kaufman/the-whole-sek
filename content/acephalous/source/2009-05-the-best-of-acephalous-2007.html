reviewed my troops that I would be leading into battle, that I began to
have doubts about the declining standards of the National Guard. Yes,
we hit the enrollment targets, sure. But with what sort of men? A guy
so inordinately proud of his chest bush that he refused to wear his
fatigues, an ape from the San Diego zoo, a Star Wars nut who was scared
to appear in public without his R2D2 getup, and an illegal Mexican
wrestler who went by &#39;el vaquero secreto&#39;? It was, in short, the moment
when I should have known that <em>les jeux sont faits</em>. We were well and

He quotes one of the geniuses from Big Hollywood (who, incidentally, just learned what the word &quot;satrap&quot; meant): In their neverending quest to wrest more power by creating what H. L. Mencken correctly characterized as an endless series of hobgoblins requiring a socialist elite’s powers to destroy, the socialists and their media satraps continually raise fears of everything conceivable . . . Then argues that: Naturally he doesn't link; this is from Mencken's In Defense of Women, and the passage from which it comes doesn't mention socialists at all, and is explicitly about the starting and conduct of modern wars, which Mencken attributes to modern civilization &quot;especially under democracy.&quot; But I don't think Karnick was purposely misleading his readers . . . Because Mr. Word-of-the-Day wasn't misleading his readers. roy doesn't seem to realize that conservatives only discovered Seth Graeme-Smith's Pride and Prejudice and Zombies earlier this week and that this Big Hollywood-style satrap is merely playing along. Just like Graeme-Smith improved upon Austen by inserting zombies into scenes in which they clearly don't belong, conservatives are now inserting socialists and communists into diatribes in which they clearly don't belong. For example, Donald Douglas complains that people find the idea of him being a professor beyond belief, but then he writes this: I saved a classic example of the &quot;I can't believe you're a professor&quot; slur from a post last year,&quot; Matt Yglesias, Jennifer Palmieri, and the Third Way.&quot; As some readers know, Matthew Yglesias is an American communist. There is no position that's too far to the left for that man. Clearly, anyone who thinks that there &quot;is no position too far to the left for [Yglesias]&quot; deserves to have his credentials questioned. Off the top of my head, I can list fifteen comments on every one of Yglesias's posts going back seven years as evidence that lefter positions than those he's staked exist. Douglas duct-taped the evidentiary bar to his ankles, so he shouldn't be surprised that people are incredulous when he claims that his day job involves teaching impressionable youths how to hurdle. But it's all a ruse. Douglas is merely playing the zombifying game with socialists and communists. He doesn't believe Yglesias is a communist anymore than Graeme-Smith thinks Austen really wrote about zombies. He's not hilariously obtuse—he's just playing the communitizing game. It's like zombies, only with communists and socialists. I'm surprised (and frankly disappointed) roy didn't pick up on this. Does he seriously believe conservatives have been so traumatized by three months of a painfully centrist presidency that they're spying pinkos in the hedgerows? As if. (x-posted.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/05/be-the-first-on-your-block-to-collect-them-all.html"><span><strong>Be the first on your block to collect them all!</strong> And that concludes my &quot;Best of&quot; series for another year. I tend to think that self-selected lists work better than random category clouds. (I don't myself, nor do I know of anyone, who rigorously tags all posts all the time according to the same criteria, though Lord knows we try.) Over the next few weeks I'm going to continue cleaning up those lists (the first three all look hideous) as well as the posts linked in them, so if you want to see what real-time behind-the-scenes editing looks like, you know where to go. (And if that's your bag, I'll be repainting the apartment any week now and can set up a webcam for you.) To address Adam's comment, I did link the funny posts in &quot;DISSERTATION ACCOMPLISHED&quot; in what I consider to be the descending order of their humorousness. (Talking about funny things in such mangled clauses should be illegal.) But one of the great things about blogging is that people can tell you when your self-evaluations are off-base. I think it's great that Adam thinks that this is funnier this or this, because that means that someone I've never met before has a strong opinion about my writing . . . which, when you think about it, is all sorts of awesome. (And now it looks like the blog's won Connect Four twice over. Time for me to stop while I'm ahead.)</span></a></div>
