<p>Reading the Richard Hofstadter intellectual biography sparked an interest in how other academic stars—or &quot;<a href="http://www.theminnesotareview.org/ns52/index.html">academostars</a>&quot;—stormed the academy.&nbsp; Needless to say, I've been surprised by the bumbling.&nbsp; Here's <a href="http://www.theminnesotareview.org/ns55/michaels.htm">Walter Benn Michaels</a>:</p><blockquote><p>When I was in graduate school, no one with any intellectual ambition
would have wanted to become an Americanist. God knows I didn't. There
were some good things I've discovered retroactively, but it was not a
high-tech field in the 60s and it was not (in my view anyway) an
intellectually ambitious field. I became an Americanist by accident; I
was trained as a modernist, which was to me much more attractive. I was
trained by Hugh Kenner, who was certainly influential and whose writing
was ambitious, interesting, and brilliant literary criticism. I became
an Americanist just because I went on the job market and there was a
job at Hopkins and I was working on Henry James. But the James I was
working on was the James out of modernism. I actually started reading
Henry James because of my work on Pound—Pound had written a very
important essay on James—so I thought I'd sit down and read through
James. I thought this would be a good thing to do over the summer,
which was no way near long enough. I got much more interested in James
than I was in Pound, but it was still in the context of modernism, of
European modernism. But the job at Hopkins was for an Americanist, and
at one point the then-chair Ronald Paulson called me up and asked me,
&quot;So is your Henry James Hawthorne's James or Turgenev's James?&quot; Well,
it was obvious what the right answer for that job was—&quot;Hawthorne's
James.&quot; In fact my James was Turgenev's, but I said Hawthorne.</p></blockquote><p>Remarkable.&nbsp; He spent <em>the summer </em>studying what he was hired in the Fall to teach.&nbsp; I would chalk this up to Michaels' overweening brilliance, but the Hofstadter biography compels me to think about this differently.&nbsp; People stumbled into prominence back then.&nbsp; Alongside the cutthroat culture so lovingly described by David Lodge existed the picaresque narratives of &quot;professionalization.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>How did Michaels become interested in Derrida?&nbsp; Coincidence:</p><blockquote><p class="justify">So I was staying at Santa Barbara and didn't know what to do. Herb Schneidau, who was also a Poundian and had been at <abbr>SUNY</abbr>-Buffalo,
was a lifesaver for me in the sense that he knew what was going on in
the academic world. He showed up in 1970 or 1971 and he had a hardcover
book called &quot;The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man,&quot; which
was later retitled <em>The Structuralist Controversy</em>. He had been
blown away by Derrida's piece in the book [&quot;Structure, Sign, and Play
in the Discourse of the Human Sciences&quot;]. Herb didn't speak French and
hired me as his research assistant to read this book, <em>De la grammatologie</em>,
and to write up a synopsis of the argument. I spoke French and had made
a living off doing translations from French. Well, writing a synopsis
of the argument of <em>Grammatology</em> is not that easy. It took me a long time, and I really got into it.</p>

<p>That was the moment that made it clear to me that
there was a kind of writing that I could do that I was attracted to.
First Hugh had been an interesting example of what a literary critic
might be, and I imitated him for a year or two, but I could never do
what he did. So reading Derrida at that point made it clear there was a
whole set of issues out there that I was very interested in.</p></blockquote><p>If Herb had spoken French, Michaels wouldn't have been familiar with Derrida.&nbsp; What interests me most about Michaels' intellectual development is how its contingencies have been routinized.&nbsp; The people he happened to encounter at the places he happened to encounter them have been transformed from arbitrary events in one man's intellectual history into a program of study 99 percent of literary scholars follow.&nbsp; </p>

<p>That &quot;one man&quot; bit may be overplaying it.&nbsp; Expand that to &quot;one generation&quot; and the charges stick.&nbsp; The moribund state of literary theory may result from the fact that each new generation of graduate students is asked to recapitulate in anthologies the seminal moments in the lives of a previous generation.&nbsp; Nothing intrinsic to the thought which falls under the heading of &quot;theory&quot; is responsible for the current state of affairs.&nbsp; What's responsible is that we're being asked to &quot;experience&quot; a previous generation's adventure.&nbsp; Only instead of the ideas being alive in the mouths of their representative, they sit there dead on the page.&nbsp; This generation isn't allowed the freedom to stumble the way Michaels and Gallagher and Fish's was.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Good Lord.&nbsp; That would be <em>disastrous</em>.&nbsp; We need immediate professionalization.&nbsp; We have to follow the path blazed by our betters.&nbsp; That's insufficient.&nbsp; We have to do it by finding the footprints they embedded in the snow and follow <em>them </em>up the mountainside.&nbsp; <br /><em></em> </p>

<p>Exactly!  And it always fascinates me that this generation had steady jobs -- often tenured positions -- without having published much at all.  It seems that securing a job was more about one&#39;s advisor (i.e., Kenner) and the notion that a young scholar had been blessed, Old Testament style, by an established figure.  What them damned feminists call &quot;patriarchy,&quot; or the boys network. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a collection of intellectual biographies out there, with essays and interviews by people like Rorty and Berube and others, and I remember constantly being struck by what you perfectly capture in the term &quot;picaresque.&quot;  Throughout the collection, there&#39;s this tone of, &quot;I went to grad school, did fine but didn&#39;t stand out, wandered around, had important friends, and ta da! wrote a very important book.&quot;</p></span>

		<span id="comment-18639586-content"><p>OMG!  WTF!  WBM: &quot;Why do we like it so much that we not only read books that attack a racism that (at least among the liberal intelligentsia) no longer exists but we also make bestsellers out of books that attack a racism that never existed? What—to put the question in its most general form—is the meaning of antiracism today?&quot;</p>

<p>Look at that parenthetical aside!  How can that first rhetorical question mean anything?  &quot;Racism doesn&#39;t exist -- at least among college professors.  So why do we attack racism?&quot;  Racism exists, plain and simple.  See Hurricane Katrina and Ohio voting fraud.  See Gitmo.    </p>

<p>And then this nugget: &quot;. . . the absolute elimination of racism and sexism would be completely compatible with the absolute triumph of neoliberalism (one look at the Bush cabinet ought to do that).&quot;  That&#39;s right, folks!  The Bush cabinet is what -- a New Historicist analogue? an example? proof? of what?  That you can fight racism and still be a capitalist?  </p>

<p>But I suppose my favorite part of the article is WBM&#39;s belief that there are two groups: the rich and the poor.  If you can afford to shop at a high-end mall, then you&#39;re rich.  If not, you&#39;re poor.  No discrimination can take place, because the prices magically repel all poor people (defined tautologically as those who don&#39;t shop there in the first place).  First off, as a teenager, my friends and I were often kicked out of high-end malls for &quot;loitering&quot; -- that is, hanging out and window shopping.  That&#39;s how high-end malls discriminate.  Secondly, being able to shop at Kenneth Cole simply means one has a credit card or that one doesn&#39;t mind eating pasta for dinner every night, not that one is rich.  I shopped at Kenneth Cole and Diesel on my $11,000 per year grad student stipend.  These might seem like stupid criticisms to make, but they attest to WBM&#39;s simplistic way of thinking about class in America.  As I&#39;ve written many times before, the man assumes that if you&#39;re not rich, then you&#39;re poor, and if you&#39;re poor, you&#39;re impoverished and a victim of the rich.  That&#39;s not even Marxism.  I don&#39;t know what you can call it.  </p>

<p>[And don&#39;t get me started on *Maus*.  The whole point of the work -- as my freshman comp students could tell WBM -- is that Vladek has internalized a Nazi way of viewing the world and has passed this down to Artie. Artie&#39;s French wife reveals the contradictions in Artie&#39;s racial typification by animal -- in the comic book itself!]      <br />

		<span id="comment-18649887-content"><p><i>By which I don&#39;t mean that there is no racism in America today or that white supremacism has disappeared—I mean instead that it has been either privatized or pushed to the fringes of American public life and that politicians today are more likely to apologize for their racist remarks than they are to turn them into planks of their campaign platforms.</i></p>

<p>Luther, as the above passage will show, I think,  you&#39;re misreading Michaels.  The racism to which he&#39;s referring in the passsage you quote is specifically anti-semitism, which he suggests has played (by contrast to anti-black racism) a comparatively minor role in American history.   </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think either that he says that there are only two classes in the U.S., or that anything he says requires him to be ignorant of either mall security or consumer debt.</p>

<p>btw, just an aside, the Gitmo point is an excellent one, but it&#39;s not necessarily inconsistent with Michaels&#39;s view at all.  arguably, one major factor in the history of American imperialism has been its justification by hostility to allegedly anti-liberal others. to wit, they hate our freedom, are fated by race or culture or religion to hate our freedom, and therefore we can feel entirely justified in subjugating them (in ways that just happen to serve our interests).  Anderson and Cayton&#39;s <i>Dominion of War</i> has a powerful argument along these lines about a long history.  <br />

Issues of grave import outside academia still become the occasion for &quot;an amiable evasion of routine, of institutional anxiety, of the tedium of the academic calendar. Meanwhile the white radicals [can] see themselves, on an investment of virtually nothing, as urban guerrillas&quot; (39). The more things change blah blah blah. Page-by-damning-page, Eric Lott's The Disap ing Liberal Intellectual reminds us of this self-aggrandizing insularity. So low are the stakes of Lott's argument against the &quot;centering&quot; of academic politics that he can barely be bothered to muster any real sustained critique of centrist politics. In its stead he flings superficial insults against those who practice what he considers Popular Front-style compromising. He calls it &quot;Boomer Liberalism&quot; [.pdf]: This powerful new liberalism, which fuses a newfound Popular Front sensibility to a crotchety dismissal of new social movements (particularly race-based ones), now confronts us as a force in dire need of an antiwhite, antistatist critique. Um, Eric? Stop with the bitter click-click-clicking already. I know that's unfair. But I'm merely borrowing a page from Lott's book. He dismisses a conference at at the University of Virginia—which with dated wit he dubs &quot;Rortypalooza&quot;—on the basis of the color of its attendees: &quot;Women and people of color from across the country were, for all intents and purposes, represented in the singular person of Spivak, the conference's designated scourge.&quot; Am I to be blamed for turning his own fine-tuned argument against him? For someone who wrote so compellingly about blackface in Love and Theft—a man whose bullshit detector is second-to-none called it &quot;one of those rare artifacts that is as meticulous a piece of historical scholarship as it is an intellectually fluent work of cultural theory&quot;—the lack of nuance in this article is appalling. An undergraduate could turn his arguments against him with ease. (You've no doubt already nailed him for criticizing the logic of the Popular Front from a position predicated upon it.) A quick look at his diction in &quot;Boomer Liberalism&quot;—the article doubles as the introduction to the new volume—betrays the same insecurities Didion diagnosed in '78. Those who partake of the centrist groupthink are: &quot;acolytes turned normative nationalists&quot; &quot;common dreamers who take center stage&quot; &quot;Robespierre-is-everywhere soothsayers&quot; &quot;superb if color-blind historians-cum-antimulticulturalists&quot; &quot;long-lost radical journalists&quot; &quot;backward-looking post-Situationalist conjurers&quot; &quot;lesser-evilist Clintonian historians of populism and communism&quot; &quot;New Democrat nostalgics&quot; &quot;undrooping denouncers of racial self-definition&quot; &quot;state romancers&quot; Not only are all those people all those things, all those people are those things in the same sentence. With one sweep of his hand Lott dismisses all those who &quot;in differing ways, lament the rise of identity politics and the decline of true populism, common dreams, or any other euphemism for class that can be conscripted to serve the interests of a white male cadre badly in need of a rationale.&quot; As Robert Boynton writes in his review of The Disap ring Liberal Intellectual and David S. Brown's excellent Richard Hofstadter: An Intellectual Biography, Lott's...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/fuck_act_theory.html"><span><strong>&quot;Fuck Act Theory&quot;</strong> Seven times today people landed here searching for &quot;Fuck Act Theory.&quot; (The oh-so-apropos capitalization? Mine.) Let the masses concern themselves with hummer this and knob-polisher that. I choose to do these seven solid citizens a favor instead. No longer will they return empty-handed when they quest for &quot;Fuck Act Theory.&quot; For Acephalous Industries proudly presents: Towards a History of Fuck Act Theory That uses of fucking not only can, but even normally do have the character of actions was a fact largely unrealized by those engaged in the study of communication before the present century, at least in the sense that there was lacking any attempt to come to terms systematically with the action-theoretic peculiarites of fucking usage. Where the action-character of fucking phenomena was acknowledged, it was normally regarded as a peripheral matter, relating to derivative or non-standard aspects of communication which could afford to be ignored. The reasons for this are largely historical. In the first chapter of De Interpretatione, Aristotle writes: Every fuck is significant, but not every fuck is a statement-making act of sexual congress. There is not truth or falsity in all sentences: a quickie is a fuck which is neither true nor false. The present investigation deals with statement-making intercourse; the others we can dismiss, since consideration of them belongs to the study of biology. Aristotle's attitude remained authoritative until the end of the nineteenth century. There are, certainly, medieval writings on sacramental and other ritual and quasi-legal uses of fucking, as for example in connection with the issue of what is involved in the constitution of a valid marriage. But such writings contain at best isolated passages capable of being interpreted with hindsight as belonging to a theory of fuck acts. They exerted no wider theoretical influence in their own right, and they did not succeed in bridging the gap opened by Aristotle between the logical and other (&quot;poetical&quot; or &quot;revengical&quot;) aspects of fuck usage. The first philosopher to have fought consciously and explicitly against the Aristotelian conception seems to have been Thomas Reid, who saw that there are, in addition to one-nighters, all-nighters and the divinely ordained life-longers, also other types of fucking permitting of a theoretical treatment. The principles of the art of fucking are, he wrote, to be found in a just analysis of the various species of intercourse. Aristotle and the logicians analysed one species—to wit, the procreational. To enumerate and analyse the other species must, I think, be the foundation of a just theory of fucking.
