		<span id="comment-119932864-content"><p>Change your name to Scott Erik Kaufman. That&#39;s what Erik Satie did.</p>

<p>NOTE: Satie&#39;s mother was Scottish, and Erik was baptized as an Anglican under the name Eric. Then his mother died and his father&#39;s mother had him rebaptized as a Catholic. My sources didn&#39;t say anything about uninstalling the Anglican baptism, but it seems to me that they should have. Catholic Eric was still named Eric. He became Erik on his own, in his late teens I think. And that was the beginning of Dada. </p></span>

<p>The first time I encountered this was in a flyer for the S.E.K. Humane Society, and I did think it odd that there would be <i>such</i> a mass of Acephalous readers and supporters in this area that they would band together in pursuit of more humane treatment for our host. Then my wife, much smarter than I and less blog-laden, parsed it properly. </p></span>

It isn't. But I have just finished this and now I do want to die. It's brilliant. Excellent addition to the families-falling-apart genre. About which it seems I've never written. Which is odd. Because I know I have. Only I haven't. Ulysses is but one example of this despised genre. Books and films which also belong to it include: The Ice Storm The Myth of Fingerprints Kicking and Screaming What Happened To Us In The Dark The Terrible Secret We Only Half-Remember But Made A Pact Never To Speak Of Again Or Else Summer Camp What He Built In There Neighbors Might Be People Too But How Mom Ignored Us Because She Liked To Guzzle The Booze Like I Like To Eat Free Candy And How It Ruined Our One Last Shot At Happiness With An Unattainable Woman Who Would Have Left Us For Mr. Hot Shit In A Week Anyhow But you can't tell the pre-digression it (again for the lazy) is brilliant from this excerpt because it (being the excerpt) lacks the clues required to decode this.</span></a></div>
