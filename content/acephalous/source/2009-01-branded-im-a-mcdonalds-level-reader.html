As for the Hello Kitty phenomenon, well, I&#39;m not sure what to make of that, but I can&#39;t bring myself to delete these joyous outpourings of love to a picture on the internet.  </p>

<p>I always picture a six-year-old whose mother&#39;s teaching her how to use the internet:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;What do you want to search for, my love?&quot;

<p>&quot;Hello Kitty!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Type it in like this: h-e-l-l-o space k-i-t-t-y.  Now click on &#39;image.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mommy!  I see Hello Kitty!  Can I make her bigger?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my darling.  Click right there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She&#39;s so big, Mommy!  She&#39;s so beautiful!  Can I talk to her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page.  See that box?  Tell Hello Kitty how much you love her.&quot;</p>

<p>(<em>The child types &quot;hi....hello kitty!!! i love you!!&quot;</em>)</p>

<p>&quot;Did she hear me, Mommy?  Did she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/hello-kittys-ha.html#comment-112569054" rel="nofollow">for yourself</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She did!  She heard me!  I love her and she heard me!&quot;</blockquote></p>

<p>I&#39;m not about to break that sweet kid&#39;s heart.</p></span>

In fact, I&#39;ll write them a song!  Here, sing this to the tune of Gilbert and Sullivan&#39;s &quot;The First Lord&#39;s Song&quot;:</p>

<p><br />
There once was a guy named Severian<br />
Who was a torturer and a journey-man<br />
He had a black mask and really big sword,<br />
A cape and bare chest, so the fans weren&#39;t bored<br />
He was kind of glum, it&#39;s a bit of a pity,<br />
But that all changed when Severian met Hello Kitty!</p>

<p>She was out frolicing all around a lake<br />
He first did a double then a triple take<br />
The cuteness cat with eerie staring eyes<br />
Would make an unsettling torture device!<br />
He said &quot;Ancient cat, won&#39;t you follow me?&quot;<br />
And that&#39;s how Severian met Hello Kitty!</p>

<p>She cheered him up, and they travelled on<br />
When his clients met her eyes, their resistance was gone<br />
She stayed with him through thick and thin<br />
As they chased around after a MacGuffin<br />
He thought as who wouldn&#39;t that she was so pretty<br />
And Severian fell in love with Hello Kitty!</p>

<p>They fell into a lovers&#39; bliss<br />
If you want to know how, you <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/misc.misc/browse_thread/thread/b435c47695e8e674/f3b9a90d2134cbb5?lnk=gst&q=faq&rnum=2&fwc=1" rel="nofollow">could read this</a><br />
She bore him a son, and he was so glad<br />
That the boy <a href="http://manolomen.com/2006/08/16/not-so-dark-vader/" rel="nofollow">had a mask and cape</a> just like dad<br />
They were all a happy family<br />
When Severian got married to Hello Kitty!</p>

<p>But finally they had to part<br />
Some outraged fans said that wasn&#39;t great art:<br />
&quot;Gene Wolfe&#39;s writing is delirious<br />
And a torturer in a fetish outfit&#39;s serious!&quot;<br />
She&#39;ll always be in his memory<br />
As Severian sighs over Hello Kitty!</p></span>

I wonder how much of it is a language barrier effect... most of the first page of HK worshippers in the thread earlier were obvious non-English-speakers, and perhaps didn&#39;t realise that the post was an attempt to calm down a torrid political flamewar: the subsequent pages of worshippers simply didn&#39;t look back to previous pages to work out what was going on, and had safety in numbers.I suppose it would be even more disturbing if someone were to call Severian&#39;s I-am-come-as-Death costume sexy... oh, wait. :)</p></span>

In that earlier post, I claimed Wolfe suffered from something that needs a better name (or an agglutinative one) than &quot;brilliant-one-trick-pony syndrome.&quot; What I mean is a stylist who employs the same breathtaking style in every single thing he or she writes. Some would accuse David Foster Wallace of being one such stylist. But his novels, shorts and essays are focalized through a variety of characters. Because each of his characters speak with a unique voice, his overall style remains heterogeneous despite his penchant for footnotes and sentences of Faulknerian length and complexity. (Brief Interviews With Hideous Men works as a perfect litmus test: no one &quot;interviewee&quot; sounds like any of the others or, for that matter, Hal from Infinite Jest.) Gene Wolfe, however, suffers mightily from brilliant-one-trick-pony syndrome. It doesn't influence my impression of any one, two or three of his novels, but once some critical point has been passed the cumulative effect of his prose stylings begins to falter before the law of diminishing returns. [Consider] The Fifth Head of Cerberus. It begins when Severian—I'm kidding. Severian isn't in this collection. But he could be if you judged by narrative voice alone. Here's Adam Roberts, responding to that point in 2005: I was very struck by [Scott's] original point about stylistic monotony. It's not that Wolfe is a bad writer, but that he is a writer incapable of changing (or perhaps disinclined to change) his writing style. There is a flatness to reading long stretches of Wolfe; and I don't just mean late Wolfe, the Long Sun and Short Sun books where he falls lazily back on endlessly elaboration couched in the form of dialogue. The whole corpus: it's all so stylistically monologic. Some writers develop a laziness born of talent: once they've mastered their idiom, they elaborate on their strengths instead of confronting their weaknesses. Here's Adam Roberts, responding to a very similar stylist today: That’s where his genius was—his extraordinary, fluent, particularised style; the way he evoked the specificity of detail. But one of the things that follows from this is that his larger artistic project stands or falls on whether we consider the details adequate to the business of representing experience. Updike’s whole corpus is a way of answering this question with: they are; indeed, there’s really nothing more than the details. His stuff is overwritten, but in the way the Ode: to Autumn is overwritten. Of course you may feel that a writer needs something more than the details; that s/he needs a panoramic ability, or at least a larger vision. But I’m not so sure. Which is to say; I wonder if, when we look back on the second half of the twentieth century, we won’t find ourselves saying: that was the age in which people became queerly obsessed with details and minutiae,...</span></a></div>
