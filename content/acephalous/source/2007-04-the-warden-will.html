</p>
<blockquote><p>[History], consequently, requires patience and a
knowledge of details, and it depends on a vast accumulation of source

apparently insignificant truths and according to a rigorous method”;
they cannot be the product of “large and well-meaning errors.” In
short, [history] demands relentless erudition.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Sorry, wrong window—that there is <em>Foucault</em> extolling the
virtues of a rigorous genealogy, not Scull criticizing him for his
“isolation from the world of facts and scholarship.” I quote it now to
dispel the notion that minor historical inaccuracies in Foucault’s work
are of little consequence.&nbsp; Put bluntly, <em>they matter</em>; a little more argumentatively, <em>they matter <strong>more</strong> than their counterparts in conventional histories</em>,
because the “effective history” Foucault champions in “Nietzsche,
Genealogy, History” approaches “events in terms of their most unique
characteristics, their most acute manifestations.” </p>
<p>
Foucauldian genealogy sweats the small stuff, as it’s in the minutiae
that metahistory reveals the limits of its teleology.&nbsp; To say—as some
have and others surely will—that the questionable citations and
historical inaccuracies in <em>Madness and Civilization</em> in no way challenge the larger theory built upon them is powerfully stupid.&nbsp; <em>Of course they do.</em>
Anyone who employs the Foucauldian theory of madness (however defined)
must now seriously reconsider whether their work remains structurally
sound.&nbsp; Perhaps the evidence they cited meets evidentiary standards;
they are not only safe, their work helps validate the utility of the
Foucauldian account.&nbsp; Even there, the problem of whether researchers
found what they were looking for persists, <em>i.e.</em> had Foucault not coined his theory, they wouldn’t have found what they weren’t looking for.
</p>
<p>
Still, the most dire of Scull’s critiques is that
</p>
<blockquote><p>much of [Foucault’s] account of the internal workings
and logic of the institutions of confinement, an account on which he
lavishes attention, is drawn from their printed rules and regulations.
But it would be deeply naive to assume that such documents bear close
relationship to the realities of life in these places, or provide a
reliable guide to their quotidian logic.</p></blockquote>
<p>
As anyone who’s read a blurb of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679752552/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Discipline &amp; Punish</em></a>
knows, the difference between formal, institutional strictures and
lived experience is of central importance to his thought.&nbsp; As he writes
in “Nietzsche, Genealogy, History,” </p>
<blockquote><p>Rules are empty in themselves, violent and unfinalized; they are impersonal and can be bent to any purpose.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Exactly right, Michel, which is why basing your first book on an
idealization instead of the who and how of its enforcement is so
problematic.&nbsp; You know how a warden wanted his asylum run—or, perhaps
more importantly, how he wanted <em>other people</em>
to believe he wanted his asylum run—but that in no way reflects how it
actually was.&nbsp; This situation is similar to the one Simon Goldhill
anatomizes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521479347/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Foucault’s Virginity</em></a>;
namely, that for all his debasing of teleology, Foucault often runs
roughshod over archival material in order to prove his world-historical
point.&nbsp; (Goldhill accuses him of being of an unsophisticated reader,
perhaps unattuned to the subtleties of classical prosody, perhaps
unwilling to listen, too eager is he to draw a “purposeful trajectory
from Plato to the Church.&quot;) </p>
<p>
I understand this is a cheap shot, uncleverly performed, but the
lady-doth-protest-too-much feel of his anti-teleology complaints seems
ever more important.&nbsp; Moreover, a shot across the bow is a <em>terrible</em> way to close a post, yet here I am ...

		<span id="comment-65330062-content"><p>I&#39;ve never read Madness and Civilization and probably won&#39;t have time to read the new edition. So I can&#39;t comment that much on Scull&#39;s review. But I do have one or two nagging questions about it.</p>

<p>Scull takes Foucault to task for his methodology and use of dated sources. Which would be no problem if we were talking about a book written recently. But this is a book from the late 50s/early 60s. It therefore predates much of the development of archival research for social-cultural history (much of the social history before the advent of the &#39;New&#39; social history in the mid 1960s that I&#39;ve read was based on printed sources). And I really find myself wondering: c.1960 what 20th-century historiography was there on the subject? There may be tons of it now (not least by Scull himself), but what was available to Foucault then? I can&#39;t think of anywhere in the review that Scull suggests what Foucault *should* have been reading instead of these outdated authors. We now know their deficiencies - but were they so apparent when Foucault was using them?</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to say that an old book&#39;s methods and sources have not survived the passage of time; that&#39;s the fate of many works of history. It&#39;s quite another to accuse the author of shoddiness and cynicism *at the time of writing*, without giving some evidence of what would have been not shoddy 50 years ago. In other words, I suppose I feel that Scull fails to historicise Foucault. And that&#39;s what&#39;s nagging at me.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-65332334-content"><p>First, I apologize for the other comments, but I&#39;m having some difficulties with my TypePad account and can&#39;t rid the thread of them.</p>

<p>Now, on to important matters: </p>

<p>Sharon, the problem with Foucault&#39;s reluctance to cite <em>any</em> twenty century sources is that it demonstrates his lack of engagement with contemporary historiography.  This wouldn&#39;t be a problem, except for the fact that what his lack of citations actually entails is his refusal to engage the <em>Annales</em> school in any way, shape, or form.  What we&#39;re dealing with here is a reluctance to reconceptualize.  Granted, my sympathies lie more strongly with Braudel and his bunch, but I&#39;m also a fan of Foucault, so this post was written with a more-than-normal amount of begrudgedness.</p>

<p>In other words, what I think Scull&#39;s failing to say is that there&#39;re a couple of traditions into which Foucault doesn&#39;t fit; and that, instead of countering them point-by-point, or even acknowledging their existence, he chooses to write his history as if none had ever come before.  I&#39;m as much for <em>ex nihilo</em> as the next guy, so long as it&#39;s legitimately from nothing ... and I&#39;m increasingly convinced Foucault isn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m cheating here a bit, since I&#39;ve read -- as I&#39;m sure you have -- material not cited above pointing to the thinness of Foucault&#39;s historical researches, but you catch my disillusioned drift here.  I&#39;m a reluctant critic, all things considered, because I want to believe that I can produce the kind of account he describes, but, out of what I can only believe is laziness in the face of the genius pressures, he fails to live up to.  </p>

<p>Jonathan, that&#39;s a terribly written final couple of sentences there, and if I could change them right now, I would; but I am referring to Foucault there (however ambiguously) ... so I think we ought to continue this conversation in more detail, as I think there&#39;s an interesting methodological discussion to be had.  More later, as right now I need to deal with some obvious and loathsome hackers ...</p></span>
