		<span id="comment-9743043-content"><p>Scott, I&#39;d read Berger&#39;s excellent book *After the End: Representations of Post-Apocalypse* before taking shots at his PMLA essay.  I actually heard Berger give the basic argument for it as a talk and thought it quite good, insofar as it identifies a key trope rarely discussed in pomo criticism (i.e., the wild child).  Berger&#39;s one of the best lit critics on the subject of pomo longing to escape &quot;language,&quot; and he&#39;s one of the few tolerable scholars of traumatic narratives.  And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad thing to criticize so-called &quot;popular science,&quot; seeing as what little the American public knows about science it learns from such works.  The sheer popularity of Sacks should open his work up to the need for critique: what cultural longing is his work satisfying?  </p></span>

<p>I actually liked Berger&#39;s article, I just thought those two sentences constituted an unwitting howler.  As for his strange critique of Sacks, I&#39;ll write about that later tonight, but my basic complaint (and yes, I even complain about the articles I like) is that he creates a set of standards specific to academic criticism then criticizes Sacks for failing to meet them.  More (and more coherently) later, as I&#39;m off to teach.</p></span>

I confess to concocting excuses to meet them somewhere other than the Ninth Ward. I confess that last night I had countless nightmares about my parents or friends being caught in their cars on the Interstate 10 as they fled from Rita. I confess that the sleeplessness these nightmares caused had a deleterious effect on my ability to welcome and introduce my students to Literary Journalism 20. (I also confess that a massive overcompensation effort is already underway.) I confess that whenever I think &quot;the situation cannot deteriorate further&quot; it invariably does and that I feel an irrational irresponsibility for it. I confess that I am even more tired of thinking and talking and writing about hurricanes today than I have ever been tired of thinking and talking and writing about anything that is not my dissertation. I confess that this thinking and talking and writing about hurricanes has lowered the odds of my finishing the Jack London chapter by Monday to a pathetic 23 percent. I confess that this confession began as a comment on Kotsko's &quot;Friday Afternoon Confessional&quot; and that despite my atheism I have found confessing cathartic. (I also confess that I did not know that outside of Aristotelian literary theory &quot;cathartic&quot; refers to &quot;the evacuation of the bowels.&quot; I confess I find the metaphorical leap disturbing.) I confess that I have searched the archives of Adam's Weblog so that I might learn more about his faith because faith confuses me. I confess that while I wish I could experience faith I am more frequently of the opinion of 19th Century philosopher and arch-evolutionist Ernst Haeckel, who in The Riddle of the Universe (1899) said that modern theology &quot;adores a personal God as an invisible—properly speaking, gaseous—being, yet makes him think, speak and act in human fashion [and] gives us the paradoxial picture of a 'gaseous vertebrate.'&quot; (I confess that my monism and materialism often depress me ... but that the alternatives depress me even more.) I confess I want to end this confession with a bang but must settle for a whimper ... because I confess the delirium with which I taught this morning is nothing next to how nebulous my thoughts are now. Finally, I confess that said bang concerned what I need in my nécessaire and why I find this portrait of a &quot;confessant&quot; compelling.</span></a></div>
