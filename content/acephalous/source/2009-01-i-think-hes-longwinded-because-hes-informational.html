but perhaps applicable to the new administration generally. Obama
signed an executive order re-viscerating the Freedom of Information Act
<a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2009/01/remarks_by_the_president_welcoming_senior_staff_an.php">this morning</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The old rules said that if there was a defensible
argument for not disclosing something to the American people, then it
should not be disclosed. That era is now over. Starting today, every
agency and department should know that this administration stands on
the side not of those who seek to withhold information but those who
seek to make it known.</p>
<p>To be sure, issues like personal privacy and national security must
be treated with the care they demand. But the mere fact that you have
the legal power to keep something secret does not mean you should
always use it. The Freedom of Information Act is perhaps the most
powerful instrument we have for making our government honest and
transparent, and of holding it accountable. And I expect members of my
administration not simply to live up to the letter but also the spirit
of this law.</p>
<p>I will also hold myself as President to a new standard of openness.
Going forward, anytime the American people want to know something that
I or a former President wants to withhold, we will have to consult with
the Attorney General and the White House Counsel, whose business it is
to ensure compliance with the rule of law. Information will not be
withheld just because I say so. It will be withheld because a separate
authority believes my request is well grounded in the Constitution.</p>
<p>Let me say it as simply as I can: Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency.</p></blockquote>
<p>I quote at length because, like the boy says, the new
administration’s informational. Not so informational as to have the
text of the executive orders <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing_room/executive_orders/">available to the public yet</a>,
but it should only be a matter of time. I write “should” instead of
“will” because conservatives might be right: all this could be simple
showmanship; that is, Obama could be saying his administration heralds
a new era of accountability while squirreling away all the important
memos with Cheney’s “<a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2007/06/hbc-90000366">Treated as Top Secret/S.C.I.</a>” stamp. </p>
<p>But this potential criticism demonstrates why conservatives find
themselves in a bind: to make it, they must confess that they believe
opacity is a virtue; that the President alone—without the advice of the
nation’s chief law enforcement officer—decides how informational his
office need be. (All such complaints exercise the same double standard
that has conservatives wishing Bush had abrogated the powers he’d
concentrated in the executive office before he left it. How will they
hash Obama’s apparent willingness to return them to their proper place?
<a href="http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2009/01/022609.php">By changing the topic</a>.) We can expect, then, that cries of the coming socialism will be bolstered by partisan fiskings of <em>the very facts the Bush administration would’ve withheld from the public</em>. </p>
<p>While they may acknowledge the facts themselves, their import will
be lost on them because for eight years they desired to know less, but
feel more: to know less about the administration’s actions, but <a href="http://mission1accomplished.com/">feel certain they were effective</a>; to know less about the administration’s intentions, but <a href="http://www.newamericancentury.org/">feel certain they were noble</a>. They wanted—they had—a faith the new administration will displace with fact. </p>
<p>That they espoused ignorance and cultivated faith won’t stop them from characterizing us <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=obama+kool+aid">as cultists</a>,
nor should it. Despite the administration’s commitment to transparency,
conservatives will assume we feel for Obama what they felt for Bush and
paint us accordingly. Their portraits will be reflections; their
medium, the very information whose absence necessitated their faith. As
for me, I welcome our new informational overlords.</p><p>(<em><a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/01/21/i-think-hes-long-winded-because-hes-informational/">x-posted</a></em>.)</p>

		<span id="comment-145923506-content"><p>I was thinking of what Andrew Jackson wrote in his &quot;Protest&quot;:</p>

<p>&quot;Thus it was settled by the Constitution, the laws, and the whole practice of the government that the entire executive power is vested in the President of the United States; that as incident to that power [is] the right of appointing and removing those officers who are to aide him in the execution of the laws...; that the custody of the public property and money is an executive function which... has always been exercised through the Secretary of the Treasury and his subordinates; that in the performance of his duties he is subject to the supervision and control of the President...&quot;(Nichols, 1994, 26)</p>

<p>Enforcing the law is also an executive function.  The executive power is vested wholly in the President; the attorney general has no separate grant of authority.</p>

<p>Change Secretary of the Treasury for Attorney General and you see what I mean.  Since it&#39;s the President&#39;s constitutional duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed,  it is his responsibility to oversee the AG.  The AG serves at the President&#39;s pleasure.  It&#39;s been long settled that removing that person on the basis of a policy disagreement is perfectly within the President&#39;s authority.  How else could he be held responsible?  (There was a debate as to whether the President would need Senate approval to remove executive branch officials.  He does not.)</p>

<p>Asking the AG&#39;s opinion is nice, I suppose, but in the end it&#39;s the President&#39;s power that the AG is executing as his officer. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-145979558-content"><p>Fritz, I&#39;ll assume for the moment that you&#39;re arguing in good faith.  If so you might want to take note of the following:<br />
1) Jackson went even farther than our last power mad executive in positing the sovereign status of the executive.  In this argument he is almost universally considered to be full of shit.<br />
2) The Attorney General does indeed &quot;serve at the pleasure of the President&quot;, however a couple centuries of precedent woud argue that this does not reduce him or her to a mere surrogate.  They get confirmed by the Senate with the expectation that they will exercise their own best judgement in pursuing prosecutions (so that, you know, the President doesn&#39;t have to directly run everything at once).  They are not entirely independent and that why we occassionally get the unwieldy beast o&#39; special prosecutor, but, outside of certain recent loons, they aren&#39;t supposed to be merely presidential water carriers.<br />
3) No one refers to the POTUS as &quot;the nation&#39;s chief legal officer.&quot;  That phrase is however used to describe the Attorney General.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-145999176-content"><p>&quot;Full of shit&quot;?  A citation might be nice.  Lest I be accused of the courtier&#39;s response, some indication that you&#39;ve looked at the removal debates would be helpful.  There are certainly some very smart people who disagree, but I happen to think that they&#39;re wrong.  On this point I&#39;ve been very heavily influenced by David K. Nichols&#39; The Myth of the Modern Presidency (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1994).</p>

<p>It would behoove you to look at both Myers v. United States and Humphrey&#39;s Executor v. United States speak to the doctrine of administrative control by the President of the executive branch.  I think that both of these decisions concur with Jackson&#39;s understanding.</p>

<p>You still seem to be forgetting the existence of the &quot;take care&quot; clause.  The President is the ultimate judge of  the AG&#39;s &quot;best judgment&quot;.  It certainly may be prudent to allow the AG a wide degree of latitude, given that the President can&#39;t be everywhere at once, but it is absolutely not necessary.  In any case, different Presidents give their AG direction was to what they consider a priority with regards to the enforcement of the law.  Forgive me, but didn&#39;t Senator Obama say something to the effect that the enforcement of federal marijuana statutes on the medical marijuana purveyors of California probably wasn&#39;t the best use of federal resources?  Does President Obama have any influence over the execution of the laws?</p>

<p>From Myers:<br />
&quot;The vesting of the executive power in the President was essentially a grant of the power to execute the laws. But the President alone and unaided could not execute the laws. He must execute them by the assistance of subordinates...  As he is charged specifically to take care that they be faithfully executed, the reasonable implication, even in the absence of express words, was that as part of his executive power he should select those who were to act for him under his direction in the execution of the laws. The further implication must be, in the absence of any express limitation respecting removals, that as his selection of administrative officers is essential to the execution of the laws by him, so must be his power of removing those for whom he cannot continue to be responsible...  It was urged that the natural meaning of the term &#39;executive power&#39; granted the President included the appointment and removal of executive subordinates. If such appointments and removals were not an exercise of the executive power, what were they? They certainly [272 U.S. 52, 118] were not the exercise of legislative or judicial power in government as usually understood.&quot;</p>

<p>Unless you want to argue that the President isn&#39;t responsible, and ought not to be responsible, for the actions of the executive branch...</p></span>

		<span id="comment-146029828-content"><p>Why do I get the feeling that this is all part of some elaborate side-long apologia for Alberto Gonzales?</p>

<p>Fritz, go back to my number three and stay there for a while. After you&#39;ve done that you can come back with, &quot;Yes, but I mean, technically...&quot;</p>

<p>Executive officers are still responsible for the conduct of subordinates even if they don&#39;t sign off specifically on each thing they do.  What purpose do you think Senate confirmations are supposed to serve if Cabinet members are only supposed to be extensions of Presidential will?  I&#39;m not sure where you thought I was arguing the the President can&#39;t fire cabinet officials.  Of course they can.  You&#39;re correct that it is in fact possible to use this power to fire to coerce an infantilizing level of subservience, but a) it&#39;s hard to tell why you&#39;d want to do that and b) better employees tend not to stick around for such treatment.</p>

<p>As for Jackson, look, I&#39;m not a legal scholar or even an Americanist, so I&#39;m sure you do know the case law better than I do.  I was in fact thinking of Jackson&#39;s response to Worcester v. Georgia, where the best that you can say is that the Court chose not to force the issue, but it seems pretty clear that Jackson didn&#39;t consider the President (or at least himself) subject to the SCOTUS&#39;s authority.  Beyond the moral issues involved in those shameful events, that&#39;s a really reckless approach to presidential authority.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-146215950-content"><p>Senate confirmations of appointments are the only Constitutional limit over the President&#39;s control of his subordinates.  If there were any other inter-branch limitation the President would quickly lose control of his administration.  The Founders were big on the concept of responsibility and were pretty keen on making sure that the President would be responsible for his administration.  It&#39;s hard to be responsible for something that you cannot control.</p>

<p>There are plenty of quasi-judicial/quasi-executive bodies of which the President only has limited control.  The DOJ is not one of them.</p>

<p>What level of subservience a President desires, needs, or achieves with his subordinates is a matter for his prudential judgment and leadership capabilities.  There is, of course, a literature regarding this kind of politics, involving the tendency of Cabinet officials to &quot;go native&quot;, the difficulty of controlling recalcitrant professionals, the fact that the Federal budget is probably the most complex system ever created by man, etc..., but none of these abrogate the President&#39;s ultimate responsibility.</p></span>

But Steven Johnson's post on Lost is bag-worthy, because it inspired an analogy for why I still watch the show that possesses actual explanative power. It maybe even convinces me. Johnson writes: Lost has the unique opportunity of proving you can build a narrative of mesmerizing implausibility that ultimately turns out to be entirely plausible simply by changing one elemental rule of the universe--and then not telling your audience about the rule change until the third act. Mainstream entertainment toys with the conventions of reality constantly (see Back to the Future, or pretty much every Jim Carrey movie) but invariably it lets the audience in on the rule changes early in the story. Johnson claims that, narratively, Lost opens in what would be the third act of Back to the Future. Consider: A boy with a head injury wakes up in a bedroom circa 1955. In his hands is a picture. An attractive young woman who's hot for him enters. He eats an awkward dinner with strangers he seems to know then leaves. A short while later, he meets a professor. The boy tells him about the thing the professor had invented that very morning. After a confused conversation, the scene shifts and viewers catch their first glimpse of a modded DeLorean DMC-12 clearly not of 1955 vintage. In this car is a damaged model of the device the professor had invented that morning. The film skips back to the besotted young woman. The boy is trying to set her up with someone else. His motivations are unclear. He stares at the picture and redoubles his efforts . . . Keep spinning that yarn out—slowly revealing the purpose of the flux capacitor, the odd rules governing the DeLorean, and the relation of the boy to the young man and woman—and you end up with the narrative equivalent of Lost. Or so I hope. As much as I slag faith in politicians, I actively cultivate faith in show-runners: &quot;Buffy will improve on its sixth season,&quot; I insisted. &quot;Because Joss Whedon knows from narrative.&quot; &quot;Alias will one day make sense,&quot; I insisted. &quot;Because J.J. Abrams is being paid good money not to make it up as he goes along.&quot; &quot;J.J. Abrams already tried to make it up as he went along with Alias,&quot; I insist. &quot;Because he's not going to make the same disastrous mistake twice.&quot;</span></a></div>
