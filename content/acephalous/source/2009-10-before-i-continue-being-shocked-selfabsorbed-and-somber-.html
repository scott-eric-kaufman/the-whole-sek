	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/10/nonfictional-lies.html"><span><strong>Nonfictional lies.</strong> These are difficult words for me to write: I lied about what happened yesterday. The road did turn into a parking lot. I did spy a car crest the hill behind me as I crept into an impenetrable fog alongside a semi. But I never &quot;braced for impact,&quot; as I first wrote. So as not to be branded a liar, I replaced &quot;braced&quot; with the more accurate &quot;readied.&quot; However, in clear violation of The Trivialities of Deportment as Required by the Guardians of Best Online Society, I made this emendation silently. There's no indication that the word &quot;readied&quot; occupies the space originally reserved for &quot;braced.&quot; Why'd I do this, and why am I telling you about it? The title of this post is an awful pun grounded in the reality of traumatic experience. Talking to the wife last night, I remembered that after the car crested I'd remembered reading that human bodies are more likely to survive brutal demonstrations of differential inertia when they go slack. After I remembered that, I relaxed my neck and attempted a deep breath before the sedan changed course. I did what is rightly called the opposite of bracing: I made like an abandoned marionette and begged the Laws of Physics to commute the inevitable. When the sedan buzzed by, I was draped limp on the driver's seat awaiting a cascade of concussive pains as my car endeavored to save my life. Why am I telling you this? Because people who deal with people like me for a living have told me to control what I can control. I can't stop the sudden intrusion of the inexplicably awful into previously pleasant dreams, but I can edit the written account of the experience responsible for the trespass. I understand that violations of decorum in the name of therapy might offend the finely-wrought sensibilities of some of you, but I currently value my mental health more than my reputation. (Without the former I could never rehabilitate the latter.) Not that I'm worried. My shudder of a pun describes a process I'm not ashamed of being victimized by. The unintentional stuttering of memory results in nonfictional lies . . . in moments misremembered as time dilates in expectation of bright death. They're the pare shavings trauma whittles from memory and they are inevitable. In order to nonfictionalize that post, I'll need to replace some nonfictional lies with others, and the thought of being called out on account of altering inconsequential details is too much to bear right now. I'm not changing my story: I'm nonfictionalizing it. To give another example, when I said I was listening to NPR when I noticed the car, I think I maybe lied. I didn't think I had until when I was talking to my brother and let slip that I'd been listening to Big Star's &quot;Life is White&quot; when I noticed the other car. Given that I couldn't have been listening to NPR and a track from Radio City at the same...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/10/cognitive-confabulation.html"><span><strong>Damnable confabulation.</strong> I'm presently torn between two alternative means of interpreting the uninterpretable. Because I'm a lit-git, I'm tempted to go with the unscientific advice Gertrude Stein belatedly offered her mentor William James: [Y]ou do not really believe yourself why should you, you know so well so very well that it is not yourself, it could not be yourself because you cannot remember right and if you do remember right it does not sound right and of course it does not sound right because it is not right. That I'm the sole source of that seminal articulation of the grit that chokes the gears of our cognitive grind to a halt is a national tragedy . . . because how are there no modernists whose Steinian veins have bled out and into Google more stainingly than mine? (I'm not even a modernist anymore you know.) Now where was I? I do not really believe myself why should I, I know so well that it is not myself, it could not be myself because I cannot remember right and if I do remember right it does not sound right and of course it does not sound right because it is not right. That would be where I was. But keeping in mind my abiding interest in things neurological—I did write a chapter on the Founding Father of American Neurology after all—you probably won't be surprised to learn that I've spent the past few days researching why it does not sound right and of course it does not sound right because it is not right. Then Jonathan Dresner damn near channeled Stein in his comment the other night: Memory is a funny[.]* It is. Jonathan's story of seeing a pink bow in a black-and-white cartoon is a poignant funny that also happens to be relevant, as I'm currently seeing things that I couldn't have seen, e.g. I remember seeing the car slam into the semi's trailer even though, as I mentioned in the original post, the fog was so thick I couldn't even see the semi once it passed me. So why do I think I saw what I couldn't have seen? My brain did the math. It calculated what must have happened between the time I last saw the car in my mirror and where it landed and then turned that understanding of what must have happened into a memory of having witnessed it happen. So even though I couldn't have seen the crash occur, I'm burdened by a nightmare-inducing memory of it.
