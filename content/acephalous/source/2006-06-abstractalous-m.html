			<p>One reason I've opened <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/abstractalous">Abstractalous</a> overwhelms all others:</p>

<p>I'm terrible at quickly, cogently summarizing what I read.&nbsp; I
belabor outlines until they're of equal or greater length than the
article they're intended to supplant.&nbsp; That's not a useful skill. 
Re-writing an article or a chapter in so many different words doesn't
help me remember the argument contained therein.&nbsp; So shortly before the
accident, I started abstracting what I read in a deliberate fashion
unseen since the days of qualifying exams.&nbsp; But I'm not good at it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I miss things.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Big things.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Things which lead others to believe I'm lying about having read the
article.&nbsp; I think this the result of dissertation-scavenging for so
long, but whatever its etiology, it must stop.&nbsp; Now.&nbsp; I have drawn the
line, in the form of this blog, and I hope you find it as useful to
read as I do to write.&nbsp; </p>

<p>My purpose is two-fold: </p>

<ol><li>Get the argument right.&nbsp; Include all the important nuances. 
Establish its place in the critical tradition.&nbsp; Provide enough
theoretical background so it makes sense to non-specialists.&nbsp; (Because
someday you too will forget how to connect-the-dots of that subtle

<li>Create a resource for budding literary scholars.&nbsp; A catalog of
abstracts they can turn to (or back to) when they need to understand a
particular argument about a work of literature.&nbsp; To that end, I want
these to be as direct (as per #1) and clearly written as possible.</li></ol>

<p>You're probably asking yourself: Why is he setting down these
groundrules if he's going to be the only one writing it?&nbsp; Pish-posh.&nbsp; I
don't think I'm that important.&nbsp; I also can't write an abstract for
every book and/or article out there.&nbsp; I'm offering you the opportunity
to help me out.&nbsp; Is your computer larded to the guts with abstracts of
everything you've read the past five years?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Why not post them?&nbsp; The information isn't proprietary, after all,
since no one will ever publish your summaries of other people's
publications.&nbsp; However, think of the status you could eventually
acquire in the profession's reputation economy: you could be one of the
few, the proud, the abstractors.&nbsp; People who took a little time every
day to boil important arguments to the bone and put them up there for
public consumption.&nbsp; I don't hold out too much hope that other people
will agree to participate.&nbsp; But <a href="http://locus.cwrl.utexas.edu/herring/">some of you</a> already do something of the sort, so I'm still somewhat sanguine about my chances.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But even if all my utopian desires are foiled, this should be a damn
fine way for me to learn how to condense arguments in ways which render
them more memorable to myself and meaningful to others.&nbsp; </p>

<p>With that, I present the <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/abstractalous/2006/06/form_and_histor.html">inaugural abstract</a>.&nbsp; It's too long by half and not nearly as tightly written or argued, but I'm practicing.&nbsp; I hope to become a machine before long (with a little help from my hyper-critical friends).<br /> </p>

<p>I wish we had this resource in the Social Sciences, or more particularly, the legal academic community.  </p>

<p>I think this is a great idea! If I could, I would contribute.  But even though I can&#39;t contribute anything you or other literary scholars would consider useful or even interesting, I know I&#39;ll check this site to learn more about a different discipline.  Maybe then I&#39;ll finally understand Deleuze.  </p></span>

Impressively conversant with the thing That is the thing. I want the common knowledge, The conventional wisdom which All who speak with authority, speak. To never need to say I want the common knowledge, To live life in the know. To mouth The easy expertise of those who know they know, Whose speech betrays possession of The common knowledge I want, And needed last Thursday, when I bought the first volume of Grant Morrison's The Invisibles. How was I supposed to know many consider it the most unjustly hyped of all the Vertigo books? A séance with John Lennon to find the meaning of a scarab? (Get it?) A series of break-on-throughs-to-the-other-sides seemingly facilitated by fungi of unusual potency? Now it may be more interesting than that. I should read the second volume before I kick it through the curb, but I would rather have the common knowledge. Rather know that it improves before I invest more time in it, or anything for that matter. I tire of wasting time when I could easily know better, if only I had the common knowledge. All of it.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/in_the_article_.html"><span><strong>An Unusual Footnote &amp; A Few Words on Form</strong> In the article abstracted this evening, I found the following footnote. See, I'm a fan of footnotes. I sometimes read them before the rest of an article in order to determine whether it's worth my time. And I've read a lot of them. So imagine my surprise when I found this beauty at the tail end of the first: Megan Glick’s undergraduate thesis, ‘‘‘Written by a Ghost of Their Time’: Locating the Civil War in Elizabeth Stoddards’s The Morgesons,’’ is one of the first works to notice the extent to which Stoddard borrows structures of thought from the commercial world to explain the domestic one; her analysis of The Morgesons and Enlightenment definitions of contractual obligation intelligently observes the porous border between domesticity and law (Northwestern University, 2002). (726) An undergraduate thesis being cited in American Literature? Amazing. Were someone to cite mine, the shame would drive me underground. On another note, tonight I wrote a far shorter, more abstracty abstract. I'm no more satisfied with it than I was with its overlong cousin–or with the fact that both fail to grab the general reader. These two failures are not unrelated; both are the product of my poor form, and both will be rectified with a little practice.* Also, I'm appending a few general notes to the end of each abstract. Most of these will concern technique–from sentence-level wit to large argumentative structure–and are there because I belong to the writing-as-perpetual-apprenticeship school. The only way to become a better writer is to imitate better writers, to work their prose over and under until you know it inside and out, and then to appropriate their techniques into your prose. *As White Bear and N. Pepperell noted, a little practice can be a dangerous thing–but I don't think that logic holds here. (By &quot;think&quot; I obviously intend &quot;hope.&quot;)</span></a></div>
