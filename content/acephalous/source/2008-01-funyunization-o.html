<p>Uhhh, why not? We have people graduating from here with dissertations that length. My friend the French postdoc visiting from an ivy had four 30 page chapters on her diss. Isn&#39;t that 120 pages? _Plus_ a nice long introduction? That&#39;s plenty long.</p>

<p>Sounds like that puppy&#39;s done. Get it on out there ---- you don&#39;t want the funyunization and de-funyunization to give your dissertation heart problems. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-96904928-content"><p>Does that mean that you&#39;re actually dropping a chapter?  Oh no I&#39;ve just realized that my head is full of SEK dissertation minutae, kept there by the mnemonic effect of so many parody poems: &quot;Wharton, London, Mitchell, and Twain&quot;.  Surely this is the most useless trivia ever.</p>

<p>Well, let&#39;s see Google -- hey, Google doesn&#39;t seem to index your comments.  You should rectify this... but at any rate it should be site-indexed under &quot;Dissertation&quot;.  Yes, here it is:</p>

<p>Wharton, London, Mitchell, and Twain<br />
Wrote about people who changed under strain<br />
Was it Social Darwinism in American thought?<br />
Not with so many other theories. It was not.<br />
Warton couldn&#39;t judge between claims<br />
London took whatever matched his aims<br />
Mitchell thought knowledge left women undone<br />
And Twain&#39;s chapter has not yet been begun<br />
It was Lamark that boggled the brains<br />
Of Wharton, London, Mitchell, and Twain</p>

<p>Based on this and the accompanying post which said that you would have an introductory chapter on evolutionary theories, I&#39;m guessing you dropped Twain, and that&#39;s why you have to bulk up everything else.  Right?<br />

		<span id="comment-96907140-content"><p>Yeah - I have apparently uncontrollable streamlining impulses when I look at my chapters.  I&#39;ll happily blurt thousands of words of roughly equivalent material on the blog, repeating and padding and trundling around my own point without much worry.  But start calling it a chapter and, no matter how similar to content to what I blog, something else takes over.  And that something has the effect that I&#39;ll go through a draft and pare things down very tightly.  Then I&#39;ll decide this makes the text read about as well as a list of syllogisms, and so I&#39;ll go back through and try to turn it into something someone might want to <em>read</em>.  This inevitably makes me think of points I should have mentioned, which means new material on which this same dynamic then starts working.  I know I&#39;m about finished with the chapter when I find myself making reciprocal edits on alternating drafts: one read, I&#39;ll cut something; the next read, I&#39;ll put that same thing back.  That&#39;s pretty much when I decide it&#39;s a wrap...</p>

<p>Good luck with the home stretch :-)</p></span>

<p><em>Mine was a 23 page intro, chapters of 30, 70, 44, and 70 pages, and an 11 page epilogue, and then 40+ pages of bib. Do not follow my model.</em></p>

<p>Actually, that&#39;s about how long mine&#39;ll end up being (250 pages, not including the bib, which will be a monster).  So I <em>am</em> following your model, only I&#39;m going to divide the pages more evenly between the chapters.  (Which makes a difference, inasmuch as I won&#39;t need to trim too much from any one to whip it into job talk/writing sample shape.)</p>

<p>Sisyphus,</p>

<p><em>My friend the French postdoc visiting from an ivy had four 30 page chapters on her diss. Isn&#39;t that 120 pages?</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s <em>insanity</em>.  I mean, unless it&#39;s as dense as <em>Our America</em> -- which takes N.P.&#39;s syllogism fetish to new heights -- it&#39;s difficult to imagine someone adequately covering a topic worthy of a dissertation in so few pages.  I mean, I was going to try to, but strategically: get them published as articles, get a better job, more time to convert them into a book, but <em>alas!</em> it&#39;s not to be.  (Of course, your friend might&#39;ve had the same idea.  It&#39;s just that around here the typical dissertation ends up being about 250 plus footnotes.)</p>

<p>Rich, </p>

<p>Actually, the Twain will appear, I&#39;m simply reneging on the whole &quot;separate introduction&quot; thing.  One introduction about the history of evolutionary theory, then a conclusion which will, at some future time, be the actual introduction to my project.  (And I&#39;m pretty sure Google indexes my comments.  For instance, I can search for your name here and it&#39;ll pop up.)</p></span>

<p><em>In the end does the dissertation merge with the personal crisis, with Jack London&#39;s ghost possessing your next door neighbor and making him into a Social Darwinist hit man purging the world of -- you?</em></p>

<p>Nope.  Outside of the acknowledgments page, you&#39;ll not see word one about my personal life.  (Outside of a couple of in-jokes which will, of course, be excised before I publish it as a best-selling work of care and importance with details the likes of which the world has never seen.)  (Or something.)</p>

<p>Ahistoricality,</p>

<p><em>If the chapters are sound as they stand, what possible pedagogic or diagnostic value is Funyunizing?  I&#39;m honestly and truly unclear on the concept.</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s largely a departmental thing -- dissertations must be of a certain weight and heft <em>or</em> produce a couple of stellar articles (as my friend and sometimes commenter Stephen&#39;s did when he landed a chapter in <em>PMLA</em>).  It&#39;s about demonstrating that you&#39;ve done your homework, investigated all the possible approaches to your problem and <em>chose</em> the one you took.</p>

<p>Aaron,</p>

<p>Yes, celebrity, yes!  (As opposed to &quot;blog celebrity,&quot; which Scott McLemee called me, but which I can&#39;t really put on the CV.)  (Although, hopefully, people will know about it anyway, as that&#39;s the only shot I&#39;ve got in a crowded, terrible market.)</p>

<p>Doug,</p>

<p><em>I was given a couple of directives regarding my bloated chapters. One was streamline. If it doesn&#39;t directly address the central theses of the diss as laid out in the intro, then it&#39;s suspect.</em></p>

<p>Well, all of it <em>is</em> pertinent, but it&#39;s material that wouldn&#39;t be in an article.  For instance, I can only address one of Silas Weir Mitchell&#39;s Revolutionary War romances in an article if I want to include the (lengthy) section on his aestheticized notion of historical progress, so I cut the discussion of <em>Red City</em>.  But it&#39;s something that deserves more than the footnote I gave it -- esp. in a longer study of his thoughts about American imperialism.  So back in it goes!</p>

<p><em>it was a slim 240 with biblio in the end.</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s about where I&#39;ll end up, only with a 90 page bibliography.  (Which is, yes, insanity, but I read a <em>lot</em> of contemporary newspaper clippings, and cite a good number of them in footnotes.)</p></span>

<p>Well, I guess I should just thank my lucky stars that my dissertation committee was about as uninterested in theory and &quot;approaches&quot; as you can get. Also, I picked a topic on which the historiography was pretty thin to begin with, at least in my region.</p>

<p>Seems to me, though, that this sort of checkboxing is what comprehensive exams and dissertation prospecti are for. </p>

<p>Anyway, you do what you need to do to be done: &quot;The best dissertation is a finished dissertation&quot; I was told once. Make &#39;em laugh, and get out of there!</p></span>

<p>I still think that padd-- er, <i>funyunization</i> is not the best way to go; if you need something longer, throw in a whole &#39;nuther chapter, even if it&#39;s absolute crap, because you can revise it up into an article or part of the book, whereas the funyuny goodness is just going to have to come right back out again before you do anything to the diss/book project. </p>

<p>1.  Scott reads 20 pages of footnotes worth of new research material for new chapter.<br />
2.  Scott adds chapter.<br />
3.  Chapter is too long!  Scott revises chapter to make it smaller.<br />
4.  Chapter is fine.  Now diss is too short!  Go to step 1.</p>

<p>That process should have Scott finishing not only a diss, but also an illustration of the mathematical phenomenon of convergence of a series to a limit.  The 30th chapter will be about 3 pages long.  The 1100th chapter will be a sentence fragment.  The 4840th chapter will be a single letter, but will still have three footnotes.</p></span>

There was very little funyunization in it, partly because I was in a hurry and in fact neglected some things I should have put in it.  Now that I am quixotically working on turning it into a book, I can remove the dissertationy stuff and add in stuff I took out or didn&#39;t do in the first place.</p>

Not very often. When I first drove to California, I passed by the largest doors I'd ever seen. Their scale defined my postmodern condition (in that Jamesonian way): I lack the words to communicate the scale of this blimp hanger. Skyscrapers may shoot into the sky, but they do so thinly, lightly, and seemingly without weight. These hangers (as there are two) were hulking presences designed to remind all those who saw them of their place. Adding to the intimidation was that they were located in the middle of nothing: The giantic things casting shadows? That would them. So you can imagine my surprise when, yesterday afternoon, I drove down that way and found my view of these quiet monsters obstructed by a mall. Since last I drove down this direction—a mere mile and a half from my apartment—someone built a mall: Best Buy, Ulta, Whole Foods, TJ Maxx, an AMC cineplex and dozens upon dozens of restaurants stood between me and my quotidian sublime. How did that happen? Easy: I never leave the apartment. I'm so devoted to my work they can erect a mall within earshot and I won't bat an eye. I possess the attractive obliviousness you desire and you want to hire me. Now. You want to hire me. Now. Now what is it you want?</span></a></div>

I sat at the computer writing or maybe just typing. Sometimes I listened to music I liked or laughed at something I read. Mostly I forwarded through songs that didn't move me and stared cross at idiots. Spent so many hours eyes wide and mouth agape I developed some conditions. Dry conditions. I tried to fix them with moisture but the root stupidity haunted me. I tried to write but could only type. Aware of the vultures circling above I vowed to continue writing or typing or whatever it was I was up to. Just as despair prepared to pin me on that dry mat I heard the dainty knuckles of a dame rapping on the door. I listened for a sharp tap of a ring the second time around and there it was. Married lady showing up here at this hour could only mean one thing ... [You continue below the fold.]</span></a></div>
