        <meta name="description" content="Few would dispute the claim that Michael Herr's Dispatches stands somewhere near the summit of journalistic achievement. You have your Capote boosters , your Mitchell partisans and your rabid Joan Didion fans . . . but even they would admit that while Herr lacks their beloved's body of work, Dispatches alone earns Herr the right to be mentioned in the same breath. Unless you ask Herr, who now insists that Dispatches is a novel with all the trappings one expects from fiction in which the author writes &quot;what he knows.&quot; The vivid characters are composites, the dramatic moments were invented &amp;c. I'm tempted to dismiss his claims to having invented these characters as part of what had been (before the memoir craze of recent years) a structural bias against the literariness of literary journalists, the best of whom only filter the brilliance of others. Who wants to filter genius? More to the point: Who can't? Anyone can filter. Only geniuses are geniuses. Such seems the reasoning behind Herr's '80s argument and his subsequent struggle to have Dispatches declared fiction. I don't buy it. My main objection is that it dehumanizes the grunts he lived with in Vietnam. My secondary one is that it suggests that Vietnam couldn't do to kids what everyone knows it did. Some of the more sensational scenes in Dispatches do seem invented . . . but so do commonplace accounts of daily life during the Vietnam War. In short: Herr wants credit for what historical context created. I don't want to give it to him. At least not for Dispatches.

But the second half of the film contains numerous reworkings of material from Dispatches and, more importantly, doesn't end with Cowboy's death like &quot;Grunts&quot; did. The novel concludes with Joker killing Cowboy after he's been mortally injured by a sniper. Then they return to base. In the film the Lusthog squad tracks down the sniper. Rafterman shoots her down . . . but let me step back and let the ironies compound. In the screenplay for the film Herr creates a composite of Hasford's &quot;Joker&quot; and Michael-Herr-working-journalist-in-Vietnam. Hasford's Joker is a combat correspondent like Herr . . . only Joker went through BT and is actually a Marine. Herr was a combat correspondent for Esquire. But when Herr adapted Hasford's novel he had Joker experience much of what Herr did and wrote about in Dispatches. He grafted Dispatches onto The Short-Timers. Thus we see Dispatches' most memorable dialogue crop up in Full Metal Jacket. To wit: DOORGUNNER: Anyone who runs is a V.C. Anyone who stands still is a well-disciplined V.C.

<p>&quot;Wasn't<em> Full Metal Jacket </em>was based on Gustav Hasford's <a href="http://www.gustavhasford.com/short.htm"><em>The Short-Timers</em></a>?&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>I admit: The first half of the fim was lifted verbatim from &quot;<a href="http://www.gustavhasford.com/timers.htm">The Spirit of the Bayonet</a>&quot; section.&nbsp; But the second half of the film contains numerous reworkings of material from <em>Dispatches </em>and, more importantly, doesn't end with Cowboy's death like &quot;<a href="http://www.gustavhasford.com/grunts.htm">Grunts</a>&quot; did.&nbsp; The novel concludes with Joker killing Cowboy&nbsp; after he's been mortally injured by a sniper.&nbsp; Then they return to base.&nbsp; In the film the Lusthog squad tracks down the sniper.&nbsp; Rafterman shoots her down . . . but let me step back and let the ironies compound.</p>

<p>In the screenplay for the film Herr creates a composite of Hasford's &quot;Joker&quot; and Michael-Herr-working-journalist-in-Vietnam.&nbsp; Hasford's Joker is a combat correspondent like Herr . . . only Joker went through BT and is actually a Marine.&nbsp; Herr was a combat correspondent for <em>Esquire.&nbsp; </em>But when Herr adapted Hasford's novel he had Joker experience much of what Herr did and wrote about in <em>Dispatches</em>.&nbsp; He grafted <em>Dispatches </em>onto <em>The Short-Timers</em>.&nbsp; Thus we see <em>Dispatches</em>' most memorable dialogue crop up in <em>Full Metal Jacket</em>.&nbsp; To wit:</p><blockquote>

<p><strong>JOKER:</strong> How can you shoot women and children?<strong><br /></strong></p>

<p><strong>DOORGUNNER: </strong>Easy. You just don't lead 'em so much. Ain't war hell?</p></blockquote><p>That exchange is a &quot;famous story&quot; Herr reported in <em>Dispatches</em>.&nbsp; A &quot;famous story&quot; transferred from the mouth of an anonymous doorgunner and anonymous reporter to an anonymous doorgunner and Private Joker.&nbsp; And that's but one example of many such incorporations.&nbsp; My general point here is that in <em>Full Metal Jacket </em>we see Herr attempt to transform his journalism into fiction by &quot;writing what he knows.&quot;&nbsp; And &quot;what he knows&quot; is what went on in Vietnam . . . because he was there and reported on it in <em>Dispatches</em>.&nbsp; I could elaborate on the paradox Herr would have us accept in order to claim the title &quot;novelist&quot; but instead I want to point to his crowning achievement in <em>Full Metal Jacket</em>.&nbsp; Which brings me back to the film's final scene:&nbsp; </p>

<p>The sniper corners Joker.&nbsp; Joker's rifle jams.&nbsp; His photographer sidekick Rafterman shoots the sniper then celebrates his first confirmed kill.&nbsp; Only the sniper isn't dead.&nbsp; She's alive . . . and just a kid.&nbsp; The unit stands in a circle around and watches as she prays.&nbsp; They argue about whether she deserves the mercy of a quick death.&nbsp; Joker shoots her in the face.&nbsp; </p>

<p>What interests me about this scene—which contra the above description is brilliant beyond words—isn't that it's not in <em>The Short-Timers</em>.&nbsp; What interests me about it is that it is in <em>Dispatches.&nbsp; </em>Only the soldiers aren't soliders but journalists.&nbsp; And the dead Vietnamese isn't a sniper or a woman but a body.&nbsp; In <em>Dispatches </em>Herr watches the reporters look at the dead body and <em>the photographers shoot pictures of it.&nbsp; </em>I don't want to belabor the analogy but it obviously meant something to Herr.&nbsp; The photographers shoot the dead in <em>Dispatches </em>but in <em>Full Metal Jacket </em>the photographer fails to kill.&nbsp; Rafterman can intervene but it's up to Joke-Herr to finish the kill.&nbsp; (Terrible pun but one which neatly captures my point.)&nbsp; I could continue with a full bore literary analysis of what Herr has done here . . . but I don't know how I would do so without psychologizing this decision.&nbsp; I'm much more comfortable pointing to an obvious moment of creative struggle than I am outlining why it ended as it did.&nbsp; I don't know why Herr did this <em>but I know that he did.&nbsp; </em></p>

		<span id="comment-14058006-content"><p>That scene in Dispatchers reminds me of so much of Stephen Crane&#39;s <i> When A Man Falls</i>.  Except Herr, unlike Crane, acknowledges himself within the crowd of voyeurs.  In the acknowledgement of the deeper meaning in this moment and by feeling the force of it, he manages to remove himself slightly from the dehumanizing aspect of it.  Yet at the same time this deepens his responsibility and challenges his ability to act out of compassion.  <br />
Maybe he had Joker mercy kill the sniper in the movie because Herr couldn&#39;t in Vietnam.  He felt powerless to effect change there, only fictionally (and perhaps this is why he reveres the medium so much more) was he able to control the outcome- rather than just observe and report it.   </p></span>

		<span id="comment-14120538-content"><p>Scott, first time commenter, long time reader.  Thank you for posting this.  Full Metal Jacket is one of the few films during which I almost vommited.  But the experience of it was so compelling (I saw it on the July 4, 1987) that I went back and saw it with my Dad, who as a holocaust survivor had seen his fair share of war.  He thought it was a great film because of the constant sense of the unexpected, of moral ambiguity and betrayal.  And thank you for all the literary references: i had heard of The Short-Timers connection but not the others.</p></span>

That said, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s clear in the post that some of what I linked to were chapters from <i>The Short-Timers</i>.  The only other book up there (besides Jamie&#39;s suggestion of the Crane) is <i>Dispatches</i>.  Sorry about the confusion. </p>

Shameless, Whiny, Scumbag Baby Boomer, Sixties-Generation Spoiled Brats . . . Or Possibly Al Qaeda.</strong> [More meta-academic-blogging later. After a long day of responsible grading I needed to lash out. I promise to bring you more questionable categories and half-baked theories about the status and future of academic blogging tomorrow.] The year is . . . some year in Eighties. A tired old man watches a presidential news conference: President: Now it's taken some doing— Old Man: Yeah, some doing. Like repealing the Bill of Rights. President: —but we have arrived. We are at peace— Old Man: Of course we're at peace! We've killed just about everybody who disagrees with us! President: —our children live in a world free of crime— Old Man: Our children live in a damn police state! President: —we are prosperous beyond the dreams of previous generations— Old Man: We're well-paid slaves. WHO WILL STOP ALL THIS. BOOMING Voiceover: My patience is at its end. The time has come. Who booms the end of his patience? Who agrees with the tired old man that peace has been purchased at the cost of thousands of lives overseas and servitude in a police state at home? He does. Examine that page carefully. Look at the artful despair on the face of an aged Jimmy Olsen. Look at the eyes in those center panels—blue and wide on the left and bruised and battered on the right—and tell me that isn't the work of an artist who understands the complex ways contemporary cultural myths resonate with the American public. The graphic novel from which I scanned the above changed the way I thought both about superheroes and cultural mythology. Thinking about the complicated interaction of myth and politics depicted therein forced my fourteen year old brain to consider a picture more realistic than the superheroes-fight-supervillains and larger than vigilante-fights-petty-crime. Sure I could've waited a few years and read Umberto Eco on Superman as defender of property rights and all things status quo. But because of that graphic novel I didn't need to. So needless to say I felt profoundly disturbed when I learned that Frank Miller had nearly finished &quot;a piece of propaganda&quot; in which &quot;Batman kicks Al Qaeda's ass.&quot; The man who aligned Superman with Reagan foreign policy has decided to align Batman with Bush's? (Click on that link even if you don't read comic books. It's about as brilliant a panel-to-panel progression as you're likely to see.) Conservatives danced in the street. But consider their logic: If Batman attacks al Qaeda then Miller must've turned Dennis Miller's corner. He must now believe in the conservative way of life because . . . no liberal would approve of a vigilante going to Afghanistan and finding and fighting Bin Laden. Now I have no idea whether Miller will reverse the symbolism of the above panel and align Batman with The War President and The Global Struggle Against Extremism . . . but isn't it strange that conservatives can't imagine how Miller sending Batman to Afghanistan might constitute a criticism of the current administration? How can...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/internal_email_.html"><span><strong>EXTRA!  EXTRA!  READ ALL ABOUT IT!</strong> The following is an email The Acephalous Sun recently acquired: Dear SmartPodiums &quot;Я&quot; Us: We here at the Instructional Resource Center would like you to modify the Model-T51789 SmartPodium previously installed in HIB 110. The specific alterations we request are: When an instructor presses the &quot;up&quot; button on podium touchscreen the cursor should move down and when &quot;down&quot; is pressed it should move up. Similarly when the instructor presses &quot;right&quot; the cursor should move left and when &quot;left&quot; is pressed it should move right. Every time an instructor touches the touchscreen it should emit a shrill &quot;beep&quot; to inform the students that their instructor has touched it. If possible we would like it to randomly emit multiple beeps despite being touched only once. That &quot;beep&quot; should not correllate to the cursor moving in the opposite of the desired direction. The cursor should only move when it wants to. But the SmartPodium should beep everytime the instructor touches it. And sometimes when he doesn't. We also request a camera with video capability be secreted in or next to the touchscreen. It should be programmed to record whenever the touchscreen is activated. Once completed the SmartPodium should automatically email the recorded video to the email addresses specified in previous correspondence. We hope these modifications can be completed before 16 February 2006. Thank you again for your willingness to go the extra mile for the IRC. P.S. If you would like your email added to the aforementioned mailing list we'd be more than happy to oblige. Watching these idiots cajole then threaten your quality podiums is all the meaning we can muster from our tiny little lives.</span></a></div>
