        <meta name="description" content="Norman Mailer's testimony during the Chicago Seven trial, full of Yippies, Hippies, and Panthers arrested for supporting the candidancy of Pigasus the Immortal (shown here being taken into custody), is one of the few extant examples of a novelist at the height of his powers being grilled under oath. At issue is the behavior of Jerry Rubin in the days leading up to and following the protest. Here is Mailer answering William Kunstler's question about whether he had a conversation with Rubin after the protest: Yes, I did in December in my home. I had called Mr. Rubin and asked him to see me because I was writing an account of the march on the Pentagon. I was getting in touch with those principals whom I could locate. Mr. Rubin was, if you will, my best witness. We talked about the details of the march on the Pentagon for hours. We went into great detail about many aspects of it. And in this period I formed a very good opinion of Mr. Rubin because he had extraordinary powers of objectivity which an author is greatly in need of when he is talking to witnesses. Mr. Schultz, the State's attorney, objects of this insightful look into the characteristics of a good witness. But Mr. Schultz objects, and the court strikes all this testimony from the books. Then, out of nowhere, Mr. Schultz demands that Norman Mailer, one of America's greatest living novelist, be barred from using adjectives in his testimony: Your Honor, would you instruct Mr. Mailer even though he can't use all of the adjectives which he uses in his work, he should say &quot;he said&quot; and &quot;I said,&quot; or if he wants to embellish that, then &quot;I stated&quot; and &quot;he stated.&quot; But that's the way it is related before a jury. I won't comment on &quot;I stated&quot; being an &quot;embellished&quot; form of &quot;I said.&quot; The court, however, did embellish on Mr. Schultz's anti-embellishment directive: We are simple folk here. All you have to do is say &quot;he said&quot;, if anything, &quot;I said,&quot; if anything, and if your wife said something, you may say what she said. &quot;Great Author,&quot; the court pleaded, &quot;We are simple folk here. Our rube ears bend like willows before your ad-ject-ives. Refrain, Great Author, refrain.&quot; During cross-examination, however, the prosecution cast aside its rube ears and started paraphrasing from Armies of the Night, and, interesting enough, so did Mailer. He recapitulated the dilemma that occupies him during much of the book: I was in a moral quandary.

			<p>Norman Mailer's testimony during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Seven">Chicago Seven</a> trial, full of Yippies, Hippies, and Panthers arrested for supporting the candidancy of <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/Shores/7484/images/ftr/pigasus.jpg">Pigasus the Immortal</a> (shown here being taken into custody), is one of the few extant examples of a novelist at the height of his powers being grilled under oath.&nbsp; At issue is the behavior of Jerry Rubin in the days leading up to and following the protest.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Chicago7/Mailer.html">Here</a> is Mailer answering William Kunstler's question about whether he had a conversation with Rubin after the protest:</p><blockquote><p>Yes, I did in December in my home.&nbsp; I had called Mr.
Rubin and asked him to see me because I was writing an account of the march
on the Pentagon.&nbsp; I was getting in touch with those principals whom I
could locate.&nbsp; Mr. Rubin was, if you will, my best witness. 
We talked about the details of the march on the Pentagon for hours. 
We went into great detail about many aspects of it.&nbsp; And in this period
I formed a very good opinion of Mr. Rubin because he had extraordinary
powers of objectivity which an author is greatly in need of when he is
talking to witnesses.</p></blockquote><p>Mr. Schultz, the State's attorney, objects of this insightful look into the characteristics of a good witness.&nbsp; But Mr. Schultz objects, and the court strikes all this testimony from the books.&nbsp; Then, out of nowhere, Mr. Schultz demands that Norman Mailer, one of America's greatest living novelist, be barred from using adjectives in his testimony:</p><blockquote><p>Your Honor, would you instruct Mr. Mailer even though he

you may say what she said.</p></blockquote>

<p>&quot;Great Author,&quot; the court pleaded, &quot;We are simple folk here.&nbsp; Our rube ears bend like willows before your ad-ject-ives.&nbsp; Refrain, Great Author, refrain.&quot; During cross-examination, however, the prosecution cast aside its rube ears and started paraphrasing from <em>Armies of the Night</em>, and, interesting enough, so did Mailer.&nbsp; He recapitulated the dilemma that occupies him during much of the book:</p><blockquote><p>I was in a moral quandary.&nbsp; I didn't know
if I was being scared or being professional and I was naturally quite upset
because a man never
<br />likes to know that his motive might be simple fear.</p></blockquote><p>On re-direct, when asked whether Jerry Rubin had ever used the word &quot;intimidate,&quot; Mailer again tries to summarize his history-as-novel/novel-as-history:</p><blockquote><p>It would be impossible for me to begin to remember whether
Mr.Rubin used the word &quot;intimidate&quot; or not.&nbsp; I suspect that he probably
did not use it because it is not his habitual style of speech.&nbsp; He
would speak more of diverting, demoralizing the establishment, freaking
them out, bending their mind, driving them out of their bird.
</p>

<p>I use the word &quot;intimidate&quot; because possibly since
I am a bully by nature, I tend to think in terms of intimidation, but I
don't think Mr. Rubin does.&nbsp; He thinks in terms of cataclysm, of having
people reveal their own guilt, their own evil.
</p>

<p>His whole notion was that the innocent presence
of one hundred thousand people in Chicago would be intolerable for a man
as guilt-ridden as Lyndon Johnson.</p></blockquote><p>While I could draw many conclusions from this, the egg-timer's gone off, and that means I, too, must be off.&nbsp; Will edit this sucker full of the conclusions I'll hand-write in the interim...</p>

Nonconstructionists feel not so much refuted as ostracized. The humanities became a closed society, captive to a weak epistemology with a mighty elocution. (348) Before you ask, let me say that yes, I know, that's an offensively long tagline. But I liked it. And it allowed me to pick fights without having to say anything. Graduate students on the graduate student listserv to which I belong would read it, ignoring both what I'd say and what Mark Bauerlein (author of my former tagline) said and throw around some &quot;brazen philosophical avowals&quot; and &quot;insinuations about [my] character.&quot; Their epistemology was weak, but fortunately for me, so was their elocution; it had all the hallmarks of mightiness but none of the actual might. Were I not the upstanding individual I am, I'd quote from those &quot;debates&quot; at length; but, alas, those debates are all stored on a computer which I believe is now a table, or a leg of a table, in Mrs. A. Cephalous' study. Otherwise I'd throw my moral qualms out the window...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/monday_morning_.html"><span><strong>Monday Morning Office-Blogging: Other(ing)(ed) Cultural Studies</strong> This intolerable situation in which I can't type on my laptop without recreating some conditions typical to California but which, to be frank, frighten me beyond the thought of them...this intolerable situation forces me to post some unsatisfying entires. Exhibit #1: Yesterday's hurried post on Mailer, which I will get around to revising shortly. In the meantime, satisfy your acephalitic dependence with another installment of &lt;booming voice&gt; From The Archives &lt;/booming voice&gt;. In 1917, cultural studies meant something entirely different from the anti-disciplinarian, anti-foundational, self-contradictory and lovin' it characterized by the thought of scholars like Teresa Ebert, who say things like Whether postmodernism is seen as what Fredric Jameson calls &quot;the cultural logic of late capitalism&quot; or is associated with the writings of Jean-Francois Lyotard and Jean Baudrillard, with Derridean poststructuralists or Lacanian psychoanalysis, it has intimated the end of transformative politics. Throw in some Foucauldian nonsense about power producing its own immantent plurality of resistances--for, as Foucault says, &quot;where there is power, there is resistance&quot;--and you have a template for much of the radical and liberatory work done under the aegis of Cultural Studies. Lump together the postmodern heavyweights, claim they're all saying the same thing--when, in truth, their nonsense is highly idiosyncratic, as is required by the neologism-happy French academe--and then build a claim on some ungentle tweakings of the whole mess. But it didn't have to come to this. In his 1917 article &quot;Wanted: A Bureau of Definition,&quot; Edwin M. Hopkins supports a &quot;cultural studies&quot; program which, instead of training people how to think like someone else, would allow them to demystify themselves: Since at first we can build on our own experience only, and are alive only to a small part of that until the observation has been trained, we presumably always shall find it well to begin our training with studies of more practical type; but still we are likely to require a so-called cultural study to bring from our subconscious-ness the cognition of the largest and finest part of our own personal experience without regard to the further wealth that comes from sources outside ourselves. Hence, though what we call cultural studies are under present conditions of training far more necessary in education than they may be in time to come, they always will be necessary in order to secure the broadest experience, the most complete usefulness, and therefore the fullest life, to the individual mind. So our bureau might give its heartiest indorsement to manual training, domestic art, and every vocational study, and recommend all for the fullest credit in college or elsewhere, but at the same time require with equal emphasis that every such study must be so directed as to train the imagination, and to train it on all sides, and then insist on such further complementary training for the imagination as may be necessary or desirable. (143) What I find most compelling about this definition, esp. in comparison to the radical and liberatory training in Marxist, feminist, post-colonial, etc. thought...</span></a></div>
