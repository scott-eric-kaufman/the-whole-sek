TEETH AND MY HELMET AND KNEEPADS SECURELY FASTENED. LET’S GET OUT THERE
AND MAKE TROUBLE. THE FIRST PAGE IS A SERIES OF VERTICAL JUMPS THAT
TAKE US UP IN A STRAIGHT PROGRESSION FROM A MINUTE AND MICROSCOPIC
DETAILED VIEW OF THE GUTTERS OF NEW YORK UP TO A PANORAMIC SHOT LOOKING
DOWN UPON THE ROOFTOPS OF THIS FAMILIAR AND YET CURIOUSLY ALTERED
CITYSCAPE. IN THIS FIRST PANEL WE ARE LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN AT A DRAIN
OPENING IN A PERFECTLY ORDINARY GUTTER. TO THE RIGHT OF THE PICTURE THE
ACTUAL OUTER WALL OF THE CURB DROPS DOWN AWAY FROM US LIKE A MINATURE
[<em>sic</em>] CLIFF. OVER MORE TOWARDS THE LEFT, DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PICTURE,
WE CAN SEE THE OLD AND WORN METAL OF THE DRAIN COVER OVER WITH SOLID
DARKNESS VISIBLE BETWEEN ITS SLATS. UP AT THE TOP OF THE PICTURE WE CAN
JUST SEE THE DIRTY GUTTER RUNNING DOWN TOWARDS THE MOUTH OF THE DRAIN
AT THE BOTTOM. THERE ARE ONLY TWO REMARKABLE ELEMENTS THAT SEPARATE
THIS IMAGE FROM A STANDARD EVERYDAY CLOSE-UP OF A DRAIN, AND THE FIRST
OF THESE IS THE UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF BLOOD WHICH IS GUSHING DOWN THE
AFOREMENTIONED APERTURE IN THIS FIRST PICTURE. LIQUID FINGERS OF BLOOD,
THICK AND BRILLIANT SCARLET, DRIBBLE DOWN THE WALL OF THE CURB OVER TO
THE RIGHT..GARISH STREAKS OF BRILLIANT RED AGAINST THE MUTED
CONCRETE-GRAY OF THE STONE THAT THEY TRICKLE DOWN ACROSS. THE GUTTER IS
SIMILARLY FULL OF BLOOD, GURGLING HAPPILY TOWARDS THE DRAIN WHERE IT
SPILLS OUT OVER THE METAL DRAIN COVERING AND DRIPS DOWN AS TINY
GLINTING BEADS INTO THE DARKNESS BENEATH. <strong>THE SECOND ITEM OF REMARK IS
A 1″ DIAMETER SMILEY BADGE, COLORED A VIVID SUNSHINE YELLOW AS IT LAYS
THERE IN THE GUTTER SMILING UP AT US AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF LURID
BLOOD RED. IT HAS SOMEHOW LODGED IN THE GUTTER SO THAT IT WON’T GO DOWN
THE DRAIN, AND SIMPLY REMAINS STUCK THERE, STARING UP AT US WITH ITS
JARRINGLY INANE EXPRESSION. A SMALL SPLASH OF CRIMSON STAINS THE FRONT
OF THE BADGE.</strong> THAT’S BASICALLY THE WHOLE OPENING IMAGE, UNLESS YOU WANT
TO STICK IN A CANDY WRAPPER THAT’S ABOUT TO FLOAT DOWN THE DRAIN, IN
WHICH CASE WE HAVE A PACKET OF MELTDOWNS, WHICH ARE LIKE TREETS
(ENGLISH) OR M&amp;M’S (AMERICAN) ONLY WITH BRIGHTLY COLOURED ATOMIC
SYMBOL ON THE WRAPPER. ONLY INCLUDE THE CANDY WRAPPING IF IT DOESN’T
DETRACT FROM THE SIMPLICITY OF THE IMAGE WITH THE GUTTER, THE BLOOD AND
THE BADGE, THOUGH, BECAUSE [...]</p></blockquote><p>That the plots of both <em>Watchmen </em>and <em>V for Vendetta </em>are present in a germinal state in this otherwise conventional work is surprising.&#0160; Or maybe it isn&#39;t.&#0160; Both of the later and more mature work evidence a deep engagement with the mundane consequences of their premises; that is, the world-building in both is believable (even if the worlds built aren&#39;t) on account of their consistency.&#0160; </p>

Scott thought typing with one hand would be easier. (Don't get any ideas, you dirty-minded lot. He busted his left wrist last night in a very manly fashion that didn't involve tripping over a belligerently hungry kitten no not one bit.) Scott can't be the only one who thought the response (&quot;I'm really fine. I'm really fine.&quot;) of the amnesiac played by Marc Blucas on Castle this week to the question &quot;What's your name?&quot; was a coincidence. (Or is Scott all hopped up on the Joyce?) Scott wonders whether it's just him or does this really not sound like David Foster Wallace in the least? Scott figured out the most efficient way to feel guilty: greeting his devout Muslim neighbor while marinating pork chops in beer. (&quot;I was trying to find a way to make this more offensive to you, and I did!&quot;) Regular posting will resume when typing doesn't require I crook my arm to spite my labrum.</span></a></div>
