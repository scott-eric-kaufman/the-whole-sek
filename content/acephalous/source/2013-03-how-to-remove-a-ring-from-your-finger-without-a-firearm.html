Dry the chafed finger with hand towel, then apply the following in any order: water-based lubricants, oil-based lubricants, semi-solid fats, hydrogenated vegetable oils, as well as any lard, suet, ghee, tallow, or schmaltz you find lying around.

 to my attention, and lest any of you shoot off a finger to spite a 
ring, I thought I&#39;d share some practical advice about ring-removal that I
 wrote up a few years back</em>.]</p>
<p>There you are on a Saturday night, futzing with your wedding ring because your wife thinks your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotillomania">trichotillomania</a>
 makes you look mangy: off your left ring finger, onto your right 
pinkie; off your right pinkie, onto your left pinkie; off your left 
pinkie, onto your right ring finger; off your right ring finger, off 
your right ring finger, <em>OFF YOUR RIGHT RING FINGER</em>, <em>non et cetera</em>. You pull and you twist; you pull while twisting and you twist while pulling all to no avail.</p>
<p>You look at your wife and you tell her, “I’ve misplaced my wedding band.”&#0160; She will look at you, <em>j’accuse </em>burning
 in her eyes, until you hold up your right hand. She will then enter the
 kitchen and return with the ingredients required to perform Step One:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Apply cold water and a little soap.&#0160; Gently work the 
soap under the ring and twist. If the ring still does not come off, 
massage the area of the finger below the knuckle to remove some of the 
fluid from the finger. Wait a few minutes, then repeat.  Continue until 
the finger is good and chafed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After fifteen minutes of repeated failure, your wife will walk back 
into the kitchen and return with the materials needed for Step Two:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2. Dry the chafed finger with hand towel, then apply the 
following in any order: water-based lubricants, oil-based lubricants, 
semi-solid fats, hydrogenated vegetable oils, as well as any lard, suet,
 ghee, tallow, or schmaltz you find lying around. As with the soap and 
water, work the slippery substance under the ring and twist and turn. 
Carefully slip a knife under the ring and try to slide it over the 
knuckle. If the ring-bearer cries in pain, ascertain whether its source 
is the ring jamming on the knuckle or the knife slicing into it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This too will fail. Your wife will walk back into the kitchen yet 
again.  Take this opportunity to try to wash your hilariously lubed 
finger.  The water-based lubricants will dissolve quickly, but the 
oil-based lubricants, semi-solid fats, suet, schmaltz, &amp;c. will take
 some time. Expect to find an oily residue scumming the top of the 
bucket used in Step Three:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3. Thrust your hand into the bucket of ice water which 
your wife has brought in from the kitchen.  Leave it in there until the 
ring-bearer screams. When he does, shoot him a look of unconcealed 
embarrassment with a hint of disappointment, then allow him to “tough” 
it out for another three minutes. Once he passes out, remove his hand 
from the bucket and check to see that the desired amount of 
vasoconstriction has occurred, then repeat steps one and two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may notice that despite the intense cold and vigorous oily 
massaging, the area above the ring becomes increasingly swollen. This is
 normal. God designed the human body intelligently: when you 
unsuccessfully attempt to remove a ring from a swollen finger, your body
 responds by further swelling the finger. It may also turn begin to turn
 dark as more and more blood rushes to into the injured finger. Now 
would be a good time to consult the Internet.  Find the <em>Ask MetaFilter </em>thread on “<a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/22649/Ring-removal+ring+stuck+finger">ring removal</a>” and proceed to Step Four:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4. Do what the jewelers do: spray Windex on the finger and twist and pull. Do it again. Then again. The <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/22649/Ring-removal#362739">trick</a>
 is to do this repeatedly so as to unlock the magical lubricative power 
of Windex. Then consider the probable reason jewelers use Windex: a 
jewelery shop consists almost entirely of display cases and Windex is 
sort of wet. At this point it will be past midnight. There is nothing 
more you can do. Put away the Windex and have the ring-bearer proceed to
 Step Five.</p>
<p>5. What you need to do now, ring-bearer, is drink enough vodka to 
catch a few hours of restless sleep in which you alternate between 
dreams in which you are <a href="http://www.thehollandring.com/hans-brinker-story.shtml">Hans Brinker</a>,
 son of a sluicer, and Hans Brinker, son of a space station captain.  
Alcohol is a diuretic, which should help with the swelling. Eat some 
pistachio nuts too, since salt absorbs water. There is also the chance 
that your finger may mysteriously unswell during the night.</p>
<p>6. You will awake to discover that your finger has not mysteriously 
unswollen during the night. That it has, in fact, swelled larger and 
darkened ominously. You should consult the Internet to learn that 1) 
fingers are naturally more swollen in the morning, 2) your body responds
 to a) alcohol-induced dehydration and b) the massive amount of sodium 
found in pistachio nuts by swelling. Now panic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may want to panic for a good long while. Remember, this is your <em>right </em>ring
 finger, and although you are ambidextrous, relearning how to do 
everything with your left hand will still be unthinkably inconvenient.  
Once you can breathe again, go online and learn what you need to do for 
Step Seven:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7. Elevate the hand above your heart for 15-20 minutes, 
then repeat steps one and two. When that fails to work, place a bucket 
of ice water on a chair, sit on the floor, then elevate it into the 
bucket and repeat steps three, one and two in that order.  Pine for the 
mangy days of yore, then consult the internet again and proceed to Step 
Eight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step Eight will require string or dental floss, but have no fear, for it is <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/fhg/firstaid/ring.shtml">endorsed</a> by The Harvard School of Medicine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Step Eight, Part the First:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Pass an end of fine string or dental floss under the 
ring. With the other end, begin tightly wrapping the string around the 
finger. Ensure that the string is wrapped evenly and smoothly past the 
lower knuckle.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Step Eight, Part the Second:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“With the end that was passed under the ring, begin 
unwrapping the string in the same direction. The ring should move over 
the string as the string is unwrapped.”</p>
<p>It should, but it will not. In fact, the act of wrapping the 
fluid-engorged finger will cause pain the likes of which reasonable 
people compare to birth-pangs. This will make your move to Step Eight, 
Part the Third particularly daring.</p>
<p>Step Eight, Part the Third:</p>
<p>Repeat variations of Step Eight, Parts the First and Second with 
packing tape, then Saran Wrap. When you regain consciousness, consider 
picking up the telephone and calling your local jeweler or emergency 
room. Exhausted interns and jewelers both keep one of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=dBh&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=jeweler+ring+cutter">these</a> handy for just such an occasion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now pony up the $35 it costs for the jeweler to repair it, and resume
 plucking the hairs from your beard one at a time. If your wife 
complains, remind her of what happened the last time. If she insists on 
reminding you about your <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/how-to-remove-a.html#comment-78713952">mother’s favorite story</a>—about
 the time you got your head stuck in a toilet seat and the rescue squad 
had to be called in, and since your father drove an ambulance with that 
very squad, all the paramedics knew you and teased you&#0160; as they used the
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_rescue_tools">jaws of life</a> to extricate your head,<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/how-to-remove-a.html#comment-78751680">[*]</a>
 and did your mother mention she has a picture of you bawling, the 
toilet seat around your head, which she took while she waited for the 
paramedics to arrive, because she does and it is around here 
somewhere—if she insists on reminding you of that, turn up the 
television and pretend you can’t hear her, because you can’t win this 
one.</p>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2013/03/of-course-obama-is-satan.html"><span><strong>Of course Obama is Satan</strong> Whether you believe that Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni, the man portraying Satan in the Hitler Channel’s adaptation of The Bible, looks like President Obama depends on a number of factors, foremost among them your familiarity with people of other races. If, like many white conservatives, the majority of your interaction with people darker than you occurs when you watch the evening news, you see this image and are shocked by the similarity: Just look at his skin! The deep set eyes! The wide nose! His ears aren’t visible but surely they’re identical too! Except they aren’t. This is why I force my students to pay very close attention to the actual frames they’re analyzing instead of relying on an uncritical sense of what’s being represented on screen. To wit: I chose this comparison because it’s the one in which the likeness, such as it is, seems greatest. It’s important to note that it’s from the conservative Newsbusters site, meaning that it’s been selected in order to heighten the featural similarities between them. The President’s lips aren’t always pursed, and choosing an image in which they are creates some features that wouldn’t otherwise be there, but for argument’s sake I’ll pretend this is how the President always looks. We’ll start our comparison with the forehead: not only is Ouazanni’s deeply furrowed, the muscles above his eyebrows are far more defined. Moving down to the glabella — the bit between the eyebrows — Ouazanni’s contains both vertical and horizontal furrows, whereas the President’s is smooth. Both have deep-set eyes, but Ouazanni’s are hooded and appear almost rectangular, whereas the President’s are almond-shaped. Beneath both of their eyes is a pronounced lower eyelid furrow which combines with an intraorbital furrow to create downward facing triangles on their cheeks. In this image, they both also have well-defined nasolabial furrows descending from the tips of their nostril wings out and around their lips to their chins, both of which are squarish. There are significant differences: Ouazanni’s cheeks are sunken, whereas the President’s are puffed; the shape and presentation angle of their nostrils is completely different, etc. In other words, a simple description of the features of their face makes it possible to believe that they look somewhat similar — or that, as many on the right are arguing, Ouazanni looks like an older version the President. Except they don’t. The number of specific features a viewer needs to overlook — or be race-blind to — in order to claim a holistic similarity between the two is just too high.* If you want to see a connection, enough featural similarities exist for you to do so, but only if you make a conscious decision to equate an image of Satan in a hoodie with the President. The number of distinctions you must overlook is equaled by the number your cross-racial identification bias prevents you from seeing. Factor in whatever intuitive model of aging you use to crease the President’s forehead and wrinkle his cheeks and it’s clear...</span></a></div>

For example, the notion that Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro's careers could have killed by an injunction, and that only special pleading by John Lennon saved them intrigues me as a film scholar (40:40). But even more interesting is Spector's discussion of &quot;Be My Baby,&quot; Brian Wilson and an &quot;edit record&quot; (44:28), which for him means a song that suffers because its seams are showing. &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; isn't a good song because it's got a lot of edits in it, like Pyscho, which is a great film, but an &quot;edit film.&quot; Without edits, it's not a film. With edits, it's a great film. But it's not Rebecca, it's not a great story the way Alfred Hitchcock could make a great story. I suppose this would make Rope Spector's favorite Hitchcock film, what with all its invisible edits—or maybe that would make Rope Spector's least favorite Hitchcock film, being that it'd be his most dishonest. Which is another way of saying that Spector seems to believe that a work in which a professional can ascertain the hand of an auteur is less valuable than one in which an amateur can. Because anyone can see the edits in Psycho, whereas it takes a trained eye to find them in Rope. At least that's how I'm reading Spector's aesthetic philosophy here: Wilson's production of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; is lacking because Spector can hear tracks end or overlap that the average person can't. Except that doesn't make any sense, because he's basically arguing for his own insignificance, i.e. the greatest artists are the ones whose labor is imperceptible to the audience. But this criteria strikes me as counterproductive if you're trying to claim that producers are artists. Just consider this excellent video about the production of The Beach Boy's &quot;Sloop John B.&quot; I've queued it up to where Wilson's editorial oversight becomes evident instrument-by-instrument, and I'll admit that it's clearly a highly edited song, but why would that make it less interesting to a producer than one like &quot;Be My Baby,&quot; which was recorded in a take, pumped into an echo chamber and transmitted into a studio? Spector seems to be arguing at cross-purposes here, fetishizing the act of capturing a sound in a moment instead of valuing the artistry required to combine various sources in order to match some ideal a composer only hears in his head. To muddy the waters further by introducing another medium, this seems like the equivalent of valuing Dubliners over Ulysses because the artistry is more evident in the latter than the former even though it abounds in both. This...</span></a></div>
