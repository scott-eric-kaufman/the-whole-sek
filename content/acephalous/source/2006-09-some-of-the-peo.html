By the 1980s, Jonathan Dollimore's Radical Tragedy: Religion, Ideology, and Power in the Drama of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries had replaced Cleanth Brooks's reading of Macbeth on syllabi, feminists had shown how much earlier Shakespeare scholarship had ignored, and Irving Ribner's providential approach to the history plays had given way to Stephen Greenblatt's &quot;Invisible Bullets: Renaissance Authority and Its Subversion, Henry IV and Henry V&quot; and other brilliant readings.

			<p>The new issue of <a href="http://www.bookforum.net/"><em>Bookforum</em></a> features James Shapiro's <a href="http://www.bookforum.net/shapiro.html">excellent review</a> of Ron Rosenbaum's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375503390/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Shakespeare Wars</em></a> and Kenneth Gross's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226309770/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Shylock Is Shakespeare</em></a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;As I noted <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/08/today_i_finally.html">last month</a>, I've come to Shakespeare through the criticism.&nbsp; &nbsp;Instead of having my love of The Bard desanguinated by years of graduate study, I've acquired a taste for the man whose works inspired <em>Dead Poets Society</em> to inspire generations to hazard a thwack at the GRE Subject Exam in Literature in English.<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/09/some_of_the_peo.html#1"><span style="font-size: 0.6em;"><sup>[1]</sup></span></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;Not only that, I've been inspired by the very works which earn Rosenbaum's ire:</p>
		</div>
					<a id="more"></a>
			<div class="entry-more">
				<blockquote><p>Had Rosenbaum finished up at Yale and landed an
academic job (at a time when it was still possible to find one), he
would probably have been one of those colleagues soured by the success
of New Historicism, cultural materialism, and deconstruction. By the
1980s, Jonathan Dollimore's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0822333473/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Radical Tragedy: Religion, Ideology, and Power in the Drama of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries</em></a> had replaced Cleanth Brooks's reading of <em>Macbeth</em>
on syllabi, feminists had shown how much earlier Shakespeare
scholarship had ignored, and Irving Ribner's providential approach to
the history plays had given way to Stephen Greenblatt's &quot;Invisible
Bullets: Renaissance Authority and Its Subversion, <em>Henry IV</em> and <em>Henry V</em>&quot; and other brilliant readings.</p></blockquote><p>
Initially, I thought &quot;other brilliant readings&quot; Shapiro's attempt to
distance his position on the Dollimore/Greenblatt junta from
Rosenbaum's.&nbsp; &nbsp;Two paragraphs later, I had to reconsider:
</p><blockquote><p>Rosenbaum blames &quot;Theory&quot; for this turn of events,
and his book is in part an attempt to persuade us that, in the end,
Theory lost and Shakespeareans are beginning to cast off its shackles
and once again celebrate beauty, pleasure, and ambiguity. This is
wishful thinking. Theory didn't lose; its victory was so complete that
we no longer need Theory with a big <em>T</em> anymore because we all do theory, though most of us do it without giving it much thought.</p></blockquote><p>

I don't exactly disagree with Shapiro so much as question <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/08/proselytical_gl.html">how complete that victory actually is</a>;
that is to say, I wonder whether the distinction drawn here between the
New Critics and proponents of theory ever existed outside overheated
rhetoric.&nbsp; &nbsp;But I digress.&nbsp; &nbsp;I want to focus on that &quot;though most of us
do it without giving it much thought,&quot; which strikes a similar note to
the earlier &quot;other brilliant readings.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are Dollimore and Greenblatt
like &quot;most of us&quot; or do they actually produce &quot;brilliant readings&quot;? 
 Do they do so because of or despite their theoretical sophistication?<a href="#2"><span style="font-size: 0.6em;"><sup>[2]</sup></span></a>&nbsp; </p>

<p>That Shapiro continues by praising Rosenbaum's account of
Shakespeare's recent editorial history doesn't help much; after all,
sussing out the authentic Shakespeare is more paleographical than
bleeding edge.&nbsp; He wants to find the middleground between materialism
(cultural and paleographical) and close-reading, like the work destined
to follow Linne Mooney's &quot;Chaucer's Scribe&quot;—<a href="http://unlocked-wordhoard.blogspot.com/2006/02/chaucers-accursed-scribe.html">discussed informally here</a>, <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/chaucer_review/v041/41.2casey.html">formally here</a>—in
which historicism wins a &quot;victory&quot; as complete as theory's.&nbsp; &nbsp;Still, he
insists there's a place for idiosyncratic works like Gross' <em>Shylock Is Shakespeare</em>:

</p><blockquote><p>Argument and speculation can only get you so far in
pursuit of a character's mystery. So he turns to imagining, and
imagines himself at various points in the book walking with Shylock
through Venice after the trial scene, imagines &quot;what it would be like
to hear the sad, self-wounding merchant Antonio recite sonnet 87 to
Bassanio,&quot; imagines F. Scott Fitzgerald studying the play for &quot;certain
atmospheric effects,&quot; even imagines &quot;Shylock's laughter after the
trial&quot;—assuming, of course, that laughter was his response.</p></blockquote><p>
I don't necessarily disagree; however, I wonder what it suggests about
his idea of what a professional literary scholar does.&nbsp; &nbsp;Produce flawed
but useful work?&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Chafe at the deadening constraints of traditional
criticism&quot; while advancing its cause?</p>

variety of students with differing preparations, the use of a large
number of short, multiple-choice questions has proved to be the most
effective and reliable way of providing a fair and valid examination.</p></blockquote><p>

That may <em>look</em> like a period after &quot;examination,&quot; but it's actually what linguists call the &quot;understood <em>exasperative</em>.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Like the &quot;understood <em>you</em>,&quot;
the other two periods and the interrobanged &quot;..OF WHAT!?!&quot; are
grammatically implicit.&nbsp; &nbsp;As Eugene Nida observed in his classic <em>Morphology: The Descriptive Analysis of Words</em> (1949):

</p><blockquote><p>The need for the &quot;understood <em>exasperative</em>&quot; emerged as more corporations sought to create a &quot;culture&quot; via &quot;employee handbooks.&quot;&nbsp; Lacking the <a href="http://www.sil.org/linguistics/glossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsDubitativeMood.htm">dubitative mood</a>,
English speakers could only express their reservations with certain
statements directly.&nbsp; For example, the sentence &quot;Requiring employees to
remain seated at their desks for five uninterrupted hours prior to and
six following lunch will improve the workplace environment&quot; initially
provoked statements listed elsewhere in the handbook under &quot;fireable
offenses.&quot;&nbsp; The &quot;understood <em>exasperative</em>&quot; &quot;..FOR WHOM!?!&quot; allows for the sentence to be read aloud without fearing the immediate termination of employment.</p></blockquote><p>

Of course, if English possessed the <a href="http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryofLinguisticTerms/WhatIsOptativeMood.htm">optative mood</a>, these sentences could be written without recourse to the &quot;understood <em>exasperative</em>.&quot;

		<span id="comment-22384211-content"><p>Could you elaborate on the end of your post (which, by the way, is a nice pointer to a couple of new things to read)? Gross seems to be doing something that more closely resembles the sci-fi phenomenon of &quot;fan fiction&quot; than literary criticism. Laughing with Shylock? Reading over Fitzgerald&#39;s imaginary shoulder? Who has the patience to work their way backwards from such a thing to the implied argument about the text? It seems like this runs very counter to your notions of scholarly responsibility; perhaps that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>I looked at Dollimore when writing on Lear. It would be hard to think of a better example of a critic so perceptive, and so careless, according to his initial biases. Dollimore&#39;s post-structuralist training enables him to make a brilliant reading of the Fool&#39;s &quot;O without a figure,&quot; and his leftism makes him keenly aware of the play&#39;s compassion for the underclasses. On the other hand, his fashionable distrust of literature makes him sneer that, even in fiction, the wheel of fortune rarely brings princes as low as the poor. It is hard to imagine what else he would want Lear to suffer.</p>

<p>Dollimore&#39;s related distrust of philosophy, including the Stoicism Shakespeare inherited from Montaigne, makes him a bad reader of Edward&#39;s Tom. Tom&#39;s speech, in Dollimore&#39;s opinion, &quot;adds up to nothing more than the incoherent ramblings of one half-crazed by just that suffering which philosophy, according to the Stoic, guards against.&quot; Language in Shakespeare tends <i>not</i> to add up to incoherent ramblings, and Poor Tom is no exception. For example, Edward&#39;s line &quot;St. Withold thrice-footed the old&quot; is about himself; he is walking <i>with</i> his <i>old</i> father, and he is <i>withholding</i> his identity. The reference to the &quot;third foot&quot; is a reference to the Sphinx&#39;s riddle (solved by Oedipus), which is why Lear calls Tom a &quot;learned Theban.&quot;</p>

<p>Apologies for the close reading; but the idea is to illustrate how the theoretical approach can lead to both <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blindness-Insight-Contemporary-Criticism-Literature/dp/0816611351/sr=8-1/qid=1158204897/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-2906941-7273567?ie=UTF8&s=books" rel="nofollow">Blindness and Insight</a>. And this is something that I think you, as someone who tries to maintain a certain critical distance from theory, see feelingly.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/09/the_macbeth_eff.html"><span><strong>The Macbeth Effect: Wipe that Conscience Squeaky Clean</strong> In the 8 September Science, Chen-Bo Zhong and Katie Liljenquist studied what they call the Macbeth Effect: that is, a threat to one's moral purity induces the need to cleanse oneself. This effect revealed itself through an increased mental accessibility of cleansing-related concepts, a greater desire for cleansing products, and a greater likelihood of taking antiseptic wipes. After a quick history of religiously-motivated cleansing rituals, the pair turn their attention to The Bard: Thus, Lady Macbeth's hope that a little bit of water would clear her of the treacherous murder of King Duncan might not have been a product of literary creativity, but of Shakespeare's acute understanding of the human psyche. If physical and moral purity are so psychologically intertwined, Lady Macbeth's desperate obsession with trying to wash away her bloodied conscience while crying, &quot;Out, damned spot! Out, I say!&quot; may not have been entirely in vain. Contemporary psychology may have disowned Freud, but it shares his penchant for literary appropriation. Like Freud, who found in the works of Sophocles and Shakespeare a complex examination of the entry of Man into Civilization, Zhong and Liljenquist saw a student production of Macbeth and discovered bathing: &quot;Look at her! What is she doing with her hands?&quot; A round of vigorous shushings later, the pair exit the theater and park themselves in front of their favorite frozen yogurt stand. &quot;Do you think that Shakespeare fellow was onto something?&quot; &quot;Could be. Should we do a study?&quot; &quot;Sounds great! But how would we study that?&quot; &quot;First, we'll determine whether a threat to moral purity increases the mental accessibility of cleansing-related words.&quot; &quot;Yeah! We'll ask participants to recall in detail either an ethical or unethical deed from their past and describe any feelings or emotions they experienced!&quot; &quot;Then we'll have them engage in a word completion task in which they convert word fragments into meaningful words!&quot; &quot;And of the six word fragments, three could be completed as cleansing-related words or as unrelated words!&quot; &quot;Like W_ _ H, SH_ _ ER, and S_ _P!&quot; &quot;Then we'll see whether those who recalled an unethical deed generated more cleansing-related words than those who recalled an ethical deed, suggesting that unethical behavior enhances the accessbility of cleasning-related concepts!&quot; Or maybe they thought the Shakespeare brand would help them find an audience. Seriously though, I have more of a problem with the unexamined theory of the symbolic favored by contemporary psychology than its psychoanalytic equivalent. Not that depth or complexity necessarily mean anything, but the ease with which Zhong and Liljenquist place cleanliness next to turpitude disturbs me: Physical cleansing may wash away moral sins through symbolic self-completion; that is, people are motivated to complete their self-definitions (e.g., musicians) when indicators or symbols of this definition are lacking (e.g., skills) by engaging in activities that complete the symbols (e.g., training). Thus, when moral self-definition is at stake, such as when one has indulged in morally questionable activities, one should naturally be motivated to engage in activities that will restore moral integrity....</span></a></div>
