<p>It&#39;s trying to imitate <em>Harper&#39;s</em> style that twists sentences and makes your pedantry justifiable.  So <em>it&#39;s not my fault</em>.  </p>

<p><em>The decades and prime numbers thing is making my head hurt. Did you mean centuries? How do prime numbers come in?</em></p>

<p>That was just me being odd like <em>Harper&#39;s</em>.  All I meant was that he probably hasn&#39;t eaten at Applebee&#39;s since the 1800s ... and crap, I punted that one too.  It should&#39;ve read &quot;centuries.&quot;  Apparently, yesterday wasn&#39;t a day on which I should&#39;ve been writing.  Lord knows what I&#39;ll find when I turn to the dissertation this afternoon.  (Please Lord let it be good.  Please Lord let it be good.)</p>

<p><em>Would it be humorless to note that &quot;joules&quot; and &quot;kilowatt-hours&quot; are measures of the same thing?</em></p>

<p>Damn it, I screwed that one up too.  I meant to write &quot;joules per kilowatt <b>miles</b> per hour.&quot;  You know, I wanted to be obviously wrong, not provoke pedantry.  Christ, now I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll need a stiff drink before I go back to my chapter today.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to like what I find.</p></span>

My mind, being mine, immediately constellated the three and returned a memory of the perfect lyric: &quot;Hey kid, you think that's oil? That ain't oil that's blood.&quot; I wonder what he's thinking when he hit that storm— Or was he just lost in the flood? Then: And some kid comes blastin' round the corner, But a cop puts him right away. He lays on the street holding his leg screaming something in Spanish, Still breathing when I walked away. And somebody said, &quot;Hey man did you see that? His body hit the street with such a beautiful thud.&quot; I wonder what the dude was saying— Or was he just lost in the flood? It sounds better than it looks. But doesn't it look topical? A song about a veteran returned back from the front; the mistaking of blood for oil; a tale about overzealous police employing excessive force. It could be topical. It isn't. Not in the least. But damn is it ever evocative:</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/06/you-can-only-ho.html"><span><strong>You Can Only Hope To Contain Me</strong> Because you can't stop a man when hypergraphia grips him. Briefly: If you're into dissertation pangs, Acephalous is where you'll find me writing about them. If literary theory tickles your fancy, you can find me on The Valve. If you like the historical arcana and/or the political posts, feel free to join me, Ari and Eric on The Edge of the American West. As I mention here, I think this move makes sense. Feel free to disagree. But before you do, consider this: whenever I write about politics here, I feel like I'm violating the spirit of the place. [Insert Ivory Tower crack] This seems to me the best way to keep all my readers satisfied. But I've been wrong before.</span></a></div>
