		<span id="comment-22847533-content"><p>Actually, the will to power is not in accord with an evolutionist view of the world at all; Nietzsche not only criticizes Darwin’s theory for being an “incomprehensibly one-sided doctrine” (TGS 349) but refutes it. The world is not advancing, ages and epochs have not become stronger, but weaker. In Twilight of the Idols, the Renaissance is seen as the last great age, an age that was strong, noble and prodigal; out of such positive forces, it created great values. The modern age in contrast is weaker, decadent, and pitiable; out of such negative forces, it created pitiable virtues. In aphorism 349 from TGS, he states further that the “struggle for existence is only an exception, a temporary restriction of the will to life. The great and small struggle always revolves around superiority, around growth and expansion, around power – in accordance with the will to power which is the will of life.” </p>

<p>A similar critique is made years later in Twilight of the Idols in section 14 of Skirmishes of an Untimely Man, “Anti-Darwin”: “Supposing, however, that this struggle exists – and it does indeed occur – its outcome is the reverse of that desired by the school of Darwin, of that which one ought perhaps to desire with them: namely, the defeat of the stronger, the more privileged, the fortunate exceptions. Species do not grow more perfect: the weaker dominate the strong again and again – the reason being they are the great majority, and they are also cleverer. . .”</p>

<p>And in On the Genealogy of Morals he notes that “one should not overlook this fact: the strong are naturally inclined to separate as the weak are to congregate; if the former unite together, it is only with the aim of an aggressive collective action and collective satisfaction of their will to power, and with much resistance from the individual conscience; the latter, on the contrary, enjoy precisely this coming together – their instinct is just as much satisfied by this as the instinct of the born “masters” . . . is fundamentally irritated and disquieted by such organization” (3, 18).</p>

<p>Those Nietzsche defined as most weak, the priestly caste and their ilk, are precisely those who overpowered and defeated the nobles, those he defined as the strongest, most admirable, or, to use Darwin’s terminology, “the fittest”. So, it is hardly the “fittest” who survive in this world, but the most “clever” – the “fittest” actually perish more readily as such ages like the Renaissance reveal, for weaker ages, like ours, not stronger, follow after. </p>

<p>To exercise the will to power one doesn’t have to be one of the “fittest”; the will to power is something Nietzsche sees as a basic human function which everyone exercises – the ‘slave’ just as the ‘master’ exercises will to power, but in distinctly different ways. How one exercises one’s power is of vital importance for Nietzsche; despite common misconceptions, he does not advocate cruelty or the exertion of force over those who are weaker – observations are often mistaken for principles which Nietzsche advocates. The concept of agon (or contest) which he developed from the Greeks calls for ‘fighting’ only with one’s equals – no honest and self-respecting nobleman, knight, or sportsman would experience joy or feel stronger through defeating a weaker opponent; they would find it embarrassing and pathetic. In fact, Nietzsche finds the act of tyranny or exercising force over others a sign of a lack of power: “the state in which we hurt others is rarely as agreeable, in an unadulterated way, as that in which we benefit others; it is a sign that we are still lacking power, or it shows a sense of frustration in the face of this poverty; it is accompanied by new dangers and uncertainties for what power we do possess, and clouds our horizon with the prospect of revenge, scorn, punishment, and failure” (TGS, 13). </p>

<p>It is precisely such feelings Nietzsche wants humans to overcome, for only through moving beyond the desire for revenge, which he calls the bridge to the highest hope (the movement beyond), will man overcome what is worst in himself, what is human, all-too-human, and move closer towards that which is greatest in himself, to the Overhuman to use Graham Parkes’ new, more accurate translation of Ubermensch. “Beauty” Zarathustra declares, “is unattainable to all violent wills” (TSZ, “Of the Sublime Men”), and, in one sense, what Nietzsche desires is that men make themselves ‘beautiful’, that they make art works of their lives and of the world. . . <br />

First, here's how I sold the idea of a courseblog to my course director: It's the kind of thing that can function both as an &quot;official&quot; course blog--which the students are required to read during the quarter and respond (in the comment section) at least twice a week--and a clearinghouse for future LJ [Literary Journalism] instructors, since I'll be posting LJ-related links, teaching material, advice &amp;c. on a daily basis. [ ... ] Obviously those columns need more work: more books, since I just grabbed all the LJ-oriented ones that I've purchased through Amazon the past two years from my Amazon history; more links to more writer's websites, and so on. But that'll evolve. One convenient thing about this is that it will 1) spread the workload thin for me this quarter (I don't have to compile massive lists, merely add to the ones I've already made as revisions occur to me) and 2) be a great resource (even further thinning the workload) for both myself and future LJ instructors. Another thing this format allows me to do is have the students respond almost immediately to exercises or discussions in class ... and have a permanent record of how they went over. Since I can organize them by categories (like &quot;class discussion&quot; or &quot;activity evaluation&quot;), future instructors can click on that category and read all the posts that concern specific activities and how well they went over &amp;c. Of course, there's something more topical about a literary journalism course than, say, one I would teach on turn-of-the-century American literature ... but then again, perhaps there isn't, and perhaps what a good courseblog can do is make a course more topical, more immediate to the students' lives. Because one of the things I never can communicate to my students is how I see my research everywhere, how I tend to see everything I read in light of debates about evolutionary theory (even when those things have no direct bearing on evolutionary theory). To steal from the language of LJ: the students never acquire the sense of how immersed I am in my work, of how much of my mental space it occupies. Were I teaching a course on, say, &quot;Science &amp; Utopian Thought in the American Novel, 1880-1920&quot; and had a courseblog, whenever I'm reading online newpapers or magazines or journals I could just hit the &quot;blog this&quot; button on my toolbar, insert a little note and post it to the courseblog. If I did that enough, the students would see what commitment to an intellectual project means: constant processing, not just something casually thought-about-the-night-before.</span></a></div>

The researchers showed how cognitive, semantic information modulates olfactory representations in the brain by providing a visual word descriptor, &quot;cheddar cheese&quot; or &quot;body odor,&quot; during the delivery of a test odor (isovaleric acid with cheddar cheese flavor) and also during the delivery of clean air. Clean air labeled &quot;air&quot; was used as a control. Subjects rated the affective value of the test odor as significantly more unpleasant when labeled &quot;body odor&quot; than when labeled &quot;cheddar cheese.&quot; [...] The important new point being made in this paper is that high-level cognitive inputs, such as the sight of a word, can influence the activations in brain regions that are activated by olfactory stimuli such as the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala. Moreover, the high-level cognitive influence can modulate affective ratings of pleasantness and the brain regions such as the anterior cingulate/medial orbitofrontal areas where the activations are correlated with the pleasantness of odors. I momentarily thought the emphasized phrase above meant that these researchers were familiar with De Man. That the materiality of the signifier has finally been accepted by the scientific community. Then: Use of a word label as the cognitive input ensured that the cognitive input was high level and semantic. If we had used a picture of cheese or of a body part, this could have been a lower level association, in that neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex respond to visual stimuli such as the sight of food. These neuroscientists clearly have not read their De Man: pictures of cheddar cheese would have created lower-level associations than the words &quot;cheddar cheese.&quot; I imagine this study has implications for any philosophical school which assumes the disconnect of signifier from signified. I wish I could wrap my head around what those implications would be but I'm having a hard enough time wrapping my head around simple arithmetic today. Higher-order cognitive functions like &quot;thinking about poststructuralist accoutns of language&quot; are out of the question. Full disclosure: I may have done this to myself. I've listened to Danger Doom's The Mouse and the Mask three times through today. MF Doom's probably rap's most gifted lyricist and DJ Danger Mouse is on an absolute tear--the tiny falsetto trapped in my temple sings &quot;feels good&quot; on the quarter hour all day long--but for despite all that talent the lyric lodged in my brain belongs to Brak: Check me out, my name is Brak. I got a mom and a dad and a yard out back. We sit by the pool and we nibble our snacks, then we eat a big lunch and we all take naps. Why'd the beat stop?</span></a></div>
