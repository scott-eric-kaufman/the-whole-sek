the “Young Con Anthem” because neither “Serious C” nor “Stiltz” have
skillz is all well and good, but there’s more to their awfulness than
the sort of schadenfreude you get watching the first two weeks of <em>American Idol</em>. For the uninitiated:</p>

<p>This breed of rap is all about establishing and maintaining
identity, which you do by asserting your authenticity and questioning
that of other rappers—either by attacking it whole cloth (coastal
feuds) or its legitimacy (street credibility). The Young Cons talk up
their own game like some white Wu-Tang. Ideally, these assertions of
identity should be such that when they “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDBJXZjmLro">manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture</a>.” (Let that play while you work and your dull life will turn into a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=resUyjKmOj0">Jim Jarmusch film</a>.) What makes the Young Cons so tellingly awful is that they sat down to forge a statement of identity, <em>produced something entirely incoherent</em>,
then looked upon their words and declared themselves ready for battle.
Their awkward juxtapositions and clumsier delivery foreground
conservative schizophrenia:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bail out a business, but can’t protect an infant.</p>
<p>My conservative view is, drill baby drill,<br />
You can say you hate me, but I’m praying for you still.</p>
<p>The Bible says, we’re a people under God,<br />
AIG was hooked up by Chris Dodd.<br />
A classy gift ain’t an Ipod.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then there’s the lyric people have held up to the most mockery:</p>
<blockquote><p>Three things taught me conservative love:<br />
Jesus, Ronald Reagan, plus <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>.<br />
Saving our nation from inflation devastation,<br />
On my hands and my knees praying for salvation.</p></blockquote>
<p>They’re not talking about coalitional politics here—the necessity of
compromising with constiuency X despite their outlandish positions on Y
in order to <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/edgeofthewest.278096071">get disappointed by someone new</a>—they’re claiming <em>as their authentic identity</em>
the ideological incoherence of political coalitions. They haven’t put
the cart before the horse so much as glued the horse to its side and
demanded it be pulled down the mountain; then later, as they sift
through the gore and gristle that had been their horse and cart, they
turn to us and say, “We meant to do that.”</p>
<p>One last thing: is Scott Johnson “<a href="http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2009/05/023678.php">almost certain that this is the first time the word ‘inherently’ has made its appearance in hip-hop</a>” because he can’t understand a word black people say or because he’s never even tried to?</p>

Joe decided to take him down, his decline was swift. By Tuesday, he was on the phone telling a stranger to &quot;Choke on [his] . . . !&quot;</strong> It was a quiet Sunday afternoon when I became an enemy of the state. I was doing laundry, as you do, and was carrying a load of towels up three flights of stairs when suddenly the landing turned all &quot;GO JOE!&quot; As I crushed Snake Eyes Eyes with my left foot and tumbled head first into a hamper of clean towels, I thought to myself, &quot;If you're going to fall head first into something, you could do a lot worse than towels fresh from the dryer.&quot; My head was safe, but with his dying breath, that wee plastic Snake Eyes rolled over and took my ankle with him. I scream into clean laundry as my ankle pivots in ways God never intended. Knowing that I have to teach on Tuesday, on Monday I contact the people with the little carts and ask for a lift to class. &quot;No problem,&quot; a helpful person tells me. &quot;That's what we're here for,&quot; she says. She takes down some information and assures me we're all set. Someone will be at my place shortly before 7:00 a.m. to pick me up and take me class. Fast forward to Tuesday morning. SEK: (looking at his watch) I'm ten minutes early. Nothing can possibly go wrong. (ten minutes pass) Probably just running a little late. (five more minutes pass) Maybe I should call to check up. PERSON WHO ANSWERS THE PHONE: What? SEK: I'm calling about a ride to campus. Someone was supposed to pick me up so I could teach. (shuffling sounds can be heard) DIFFERENT PERSON: Can I help you with something? SEK: I'm calling about a ride to campus. Someone was supposed to pick me up so I could teach. DIFFERENT PERSON: Right. We can't do that. SEK: You can't do that? DIFFERENT PERSON: Right. We need a doctor's note and you didn't provide one. SEK: I'm seeing the doctor tomorrow. I can bring a note in afterwards. DIFFERENT PERSON: Right. That's not how it works here. SEK: So how am I supposed to get to class? DIFFERENT PERSON: You live on campus. Why not just walk? SEK: (rage) If I could walk, I wouldn't have requested your services. DIFFERENT PERSON: Right. We can't do that for you. (the shuffling sounds associated with hanging up a phone can be heard) SEK: (Rage) Better don't hang up on me. (more shuffling) How am I supposed to teach today if I can't get to class? DIFFERENT PERSON: Like I already said, you live on campus. Just walk. SEK: (RAGE) And like I already said, if I could fucking walk, I wouldn't have requested your fucking services. DIFFERENT PERSON: There's really no need to say &quot;fuck,&quot; sir. SEK: CHOKE ON MY FUCK, ASSHOLE! The upside is that I solved one of life's little mysteries: every quarter I teach the Warren Ellis piece linked there, and every quarter I'm rebaffled by that expression. I'm baffled no more. But you know what the best part is? Guess what I...</span></a></div>

Eddings was predeceased by his wife and writing partner Leigh two years ago. When I worked at a used bookstore, I shelved all fourteen thousand, two hundred, and forty-three of his novels more times than I care to remember. But I never read any of them. Even so, I want to go on the record and declare that he deserved better than to be killed by his wife two years before he died. (Need I remind you that grammar matters?)</span></a></div>
