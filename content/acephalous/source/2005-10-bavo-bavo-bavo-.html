				<p>PSYCHOANALYSIS, URBAN THEORY AND THE CITY OF LATE CAPITALISM</p>

<p>A three day international workshop<br />Organized by BAVO &amp; Lorenzo Chiesa<br />Jan van Eyck Academie, Maastricht, The Netherlands<br />November 18th - 20th, 2005</p>

<p>Today, the long-held belief that urban culture is the engine par excellence for democratization and emancipation processes, has been dealt some lethal blows. If Marx and his avatars still dreamt of ‘the urban’ as the incubator and accelerator of universal solidarity and radical social change, today metropolitan areas are more often than not labelled as social time-bombs that threaten to draw its hinterland into a downward spiral of disintegration, segregation and mute violence. Similarly, if for Freud the metropolitan way of life provided the ‘humus’ for the modern hysterical subjectivity – endlessly questioning and ‘working through’ the traditional mores – today, in an environment in which individuals and communities redraw into technologically nurtured capsular environments, subjectivity seems to evaporate again into a generalized autism.</p>

<p>In this conference we invite experts from the field of Marxist urban theory, radical political philosophy and Lacanian psychoanalysis to give presentations on topics relevant to understand the current post-metropolitan condition as well as ways to intervene or resist it. </p>

<p>Day 1: Identifying the Urban Unconscious</p>

<p>This day aims at the identification of the construct of the city of late capitalism. What are its basic procedures? How do they secure the city’s normal functioning? Or inversely, how is the city kept in a permanent &quot;state of emergency.&quot;</p>

<p>Of special interest here are studies of Marxist-oriented urban theorists and Lacanian inspired psychoanalysts that lay bare how the city of late capitalism depends more and more on psychosocial processes to generate the necessary increase in ‘return value’ or to secure control over its subjects. Think of the production of geographies of fear, the stimulation of a phantasmatic economy of all-pervasive transgression, the explosive ‘inmixing’ of race and class tensions, the virtualization of the everyday, etc. In these phenomena, we seem to stumble upon the ‘urban unconscious’ of today’s metropolis.</p>

<p>However, given the fact that today everybody seems to know very well how the unconscious functions but nonetheless acts according to it, an important issue is what position these analyses occupy. Is it simply a matter of uncovering obscure processes hidden to the untrained or non-engaged eye? Or, is analysis able to ‘render visible what is visible’ – a marking of what is all too visible and therefore provokes constant repression or reification?</p>

<p>Participants</p>

<p>BAVO (introduction)<br />Edward W. Soja<br />Marc De Kesel<br />Michael Zinganel<br />Juliet Flower MacCannell<br />André Nusselder</p>

<p>Day 2: Conceiving of an Urban Act</p>

<p>This day focuses on the issue of agency within the late capitalist urban situation. Which spatial tactics are most adequate and effective to tackle the late capitalist mechanisms discussed in day one? What consequences can be drawn with regards to the subject position of the urban designer, activist or analyst?</p>

<p>Both urban theory and psychoanalysis are quick to note how the city of late capitalism feeds upon the same forces that resist it in order to reproduce itself, how its managers indulge themselves in constant self-undermining ‘hysterical’ activity to get the jump on their opponents, how it utilizes urban guerrilla tactics as ultimate marketing tool, etc. However, if the city of late capitalism thus draws several classic critical stances into its orbit and depoliticizes the leftover by marking it as ‘merely terrorist’, where does this leave the possibility of an urbano-political act? </p>

<p>What do these analyses offer as ways of intervening and/or interrupting late-capitalist urban processes – albeit in an inverted or negative form? And further, what are the contours of an urbano-analytic act that not only reveals the truth of a certain situation or turns it upside-down, but opens up a space in which a different kind of urban organisation becomes possible?</p>

<p>Participants</p>

<p>BAVO (introduction)<br />Yannis Stavrakakis<br />Friedrich von Borries<br />Alberto Toscano<br />Roemer van Toorn<br />BAVO</p>

<p>Day 3: The Political role of Psychoanalysis with regard to Spatial Problematics</p>

<p>Text still under construction.</p>

<p>Participants:</p>

<p>Lorenzo Chiesa (introduction)<br />Aaron Schuster<br />Dany Nobus<br />Renata Salecl<br />Oliver Feltham</p>

When you wake up, put on a pair of clean pajamas and spend the afternoon half-reading, half-focusing and -unfocusing your eyes? When you encounter a sink brimming over with soiled dishes and decide to drink Australian wine from a measuring cup? (&quot;Check out these legs! Almost eighteen ounces high!&quot;) Such has been my day. Clutching my measuring cup of cheap Australian wine, I debate the merits of a brie-on-stale-crackers dinner. I momentarily avoid eating a dinner so unnutritive by thinking about the able demolition of Jonathan Franzen (written by Ben Marcus) in this month's Harper's. I attempt to write something intelligent about it but am too distracted by the picture of trashiness I currently strike. The irrational fear that Dell's installed a webcam somewhere on this monster overwhelms. Ashamed, I hide from the computer for the rest of the evening. Update: For those of you who wrote to express concern over my dinner selection, have no fear. Instead of eating cheese on stale cracked-pepper water-crackers, I generously spread my brie over stale whole-wheat matzah. It may not be that much more nutritious, but at least the Lord I don't believe in sanctions it.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/on_aggressively.html"><span><strong>Aggressively Mastubatory Fiction; or Two Authors Enter, Only Ben Marcus May Leave</strong> Observe the rarest of beasts: a promised post which arrives at the promised time. Earlier today, I promised Laura I'd discuss Ben Marcus' &quot;Why Experimental Fiction Threatens to Destroy Publishing, Jonathan Franzen, and Life as We Know It,&quot; and here comes 7 p.m. rolling around and here I am discussing it. Marcus begins with a description of one language-processing portion of the brain, Wernicke's area, which like much of the non-polemical part of the article, deserves to be quoted in full: I would say that my ideal reader's Wernicke's area is staffed by an army of jumpsuited code-breakers, working a barn-size space that is strung about the rafters with a mathematically intricate lattice of rope and steel, and maybe gusseted by a synthetic coil that is stronger and more sensitive than either, like guitar strings made from an unraveled spinal cord, each strand tuned to a different tension. The conduits of language that flow past it in liquid-cooled bone-hollows could trigger unique vibrations that resonate into an original symphony when my ideal reader scanned a new sentence. This would be a scheme so elaborate that every portion of language would be treated as unique, and its infinite parts would be sent through such an exhaustive decoding process that not even a carcass of a word would remain. He then apologies for &quot;wishing to slip readers enhancements to their Wernicke's areas, doses of a potion that might turn them into fierce little reading machines, devourers of new syntax, fluent interpreters of the most lyrically complex grammar,&quot; such that writers would be liberated &quot;to worry less about whether or not everyone could process even the most elementary sentences.&quot; But such enhancements already exist. He calls them &quot;books&quot; and bemoans the fact that the books that exercise Wernicke's minions the most are being attacked by those whose dominate the literary marketplace: in particular, writers in the realist tradition like the acclaimed and popular (Oprah notwithstanding) Jonathan Franzen. Franzen, Marcus argues, encourages writers &quot;to behave like cover bands, embellishing the oldies, maybe, while ensuring that buried in the song is an old familiar melody to make us smile with recognition, so that we might read more from memory than by active attention.&quot; Thus begins his attack against the author of the (criminally over-rated but) award-winning novel The Corrections. It continues unabated for what remains of the article, and that's unfortunate, because at his best Marcus effectively communicates what, to scholars of realist and naturalist works, constitutes a commonplace but which, to the general reading public, the essays of Franzen and The Atlantic Monthly's B.R. Meyers frequently obscure: The fallacy that literary realists have some privileged relationship to reality has allowed the whole movement to soften and become false ... the exceptions are terrific writers who have pounded on the emotional possibilities of their mode, refusing to subscribe to worn-out techniques and storytelling methods so familiar we could pretty much sing along to them. These are writers who are keen to interrogate the assumptions of...</span></a></div>
