			<p>S-Vin, I guess I'd disagree with you that the progressives were social
Darwinists. That's a term largely invented or popularized by the left
(like neocon and Robber Baron) to describe the &quot;bad guys.&quot; The
progressives were indeed raging Darwinists, but they were, in the
useful but largely forgotten phrase of Eric Goldman, &quot;reform
Darwinists.&quot; Social Darwinism was a term of scorn for laissez-faire
liberals (like Herbert Spencer), which is the last thing progressives
were. It's also why using the phrase &quot;social Darwinism&quot; to describe
Nazism is so unhelpful. Unless, of course, one wants to say that the
Nazis were laissez-faire.</p>

<p>And trust me they weren't.&nbsp; I know all about Spencer because a while back <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NWUyZjk2YWFhNTUyYzhjNTM3ZGNmNzcxMzU5ZDc4Njg=">I asked for some Spencer experts</a> to tell me what I needed to know about him for <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTI3ZGM3MzhjNjViMzhjMmIxY2Q3MWM1ZGYwZTE2ZTA=">a few pages</a> of my <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGY3ODg1ZGEyYjQ0OTYxYzc0Yzc0ZDNhN2Q1MzhjMDE=">very serious, thoughtful, argument that has never been made in such detail or with such care</a>.&nbsp; So when I <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MjQ1MTFhNWI4ZWM0NTY1MGFjZTk4NWUxY2Q0OGIwZDk=">say</a> that Herbert Spencer was a Darwinist, even a &quot;social Darwinist&quot; in the way
the Progressives meant the term, i.e. he was a radical libertarian or a
&quot;liberal.&quot; </p>

<p>In the 20th century, without heed to the arguments they made
in the 19th century, the left used the phrase social Darwinism to
describe Hitlerite eugenics, and to make Herbert Spencer an
intellectual grandfather of Nazism. Even though before the war such
eugenics were almost solely the balliwick of the left and Herbert
Spencer was almost the diametrical opposite of a Nazi. Regardless, the
label stuck on Nazism too. The result has been a term which means both
Nazi-like governmental intrusions into society <em>and</em>
libertarian-style governmental withdrawals from society. In other
words, anything the left doesn't like can be call &quot;social Darwinism&quot;
without penalty.</p>

<p>That's why the association between dehumanizing Nazi practices and dehumanizing laissez-faire practices can't both be called &quot;social Darwinism.&quot;&nbsp; I support one but not the other.&nbsp; We don't want to allow leftists to call us &quot;Nazis&quot; just because we don't value human life.</p>

Progressivism, after all, has a very mixed history in American politics, which takes in not only efforts to reform labor laws, bust trusts, and create national parks but also some serious doses of racism, social Darwinism, eugenics, and a very strange mix of authoritarianism and out of control populism (a point well made by Marty Peretz recently as well). Ross suggests it is no coincidence that the growing preference for the term &quot;progressive&quot; comes at a time when a new eugenics is rearing its head, and when the left is increasingly emphasizing its self-identification as the party of science (a notion some of whose peculiarities and ironies I noted here a while back.) Of course, I have no idea what I'm talking about—I have not done the research myself and will not bother to—but I think it is obvious that the racist elements of contemporary progressivism can be traced back to social Darwinism and the establishment of the national parks by progressives.

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/07/re-re-social-da.html"><span><strong>RE: RE: Social Darwinism and Progressivism [Scott Eric Goldberg]</strong> A reader writes: That last post you wrote on social Darwinism didn't make any sense. Do you mean to say we can't call the left social Darwinists because they already call us that for being neo-liberal and laissez-faire and we don't want to associate laissez-faire practices with Nazism? Sigh. Let me explain this again: the left calls the laissez-faire philosophy &quot;social Darwinism.&quot; But both the left and right consider social Darwinism (and Herbert Spencer, who I discuss briefly, based on someone else's work, in my very serious, thoughtful, argument that has never been made in such detail or with such care) the root of Nazism. So we can't call Hillary a &quot;social Darwinist&quot; without reminding the left of who the real social Darwinists were then (Nazis) and now (us). If the left mistakes their despicable philosophy for ours, we're going to have a hard time getting Bush elected again. COURTESY</span></a></div>
