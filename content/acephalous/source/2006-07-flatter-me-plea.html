<p>Holy crap, Charles, do you ever have this wrong!</p>

<p>Rich,</p>

<p>Are you trying to ironically perform the very logic of Scott&#39;s piece? Is this a Butlerian move that you&#39;re attempting? Are you in drag? Because you&#39;re doing it very artfully...</p>

<p><i>Must every poor excuse for an argument by someone you disagree with metamorphose into a whirl of unthinking self-congratulation? How many times can &quot;You&#39;re so right!&quot; appear on the same page before someone&#39;s hay-fever acts up? </i></p>

<p>Yes, that part... Bhabhian mimickry? Is that what you&#39;re up to, you sly dog? </p>

<p>Seriously, I think you should treat Scott with a little more respect... </p></span>

And, I further agreed with him that left academics, like ourselves, also demonstrate this kind of ressentiment when we continue to react to, be angered by, rather than ignore, these articles. Where is the self congratulation in that? It seems more self critical to me.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-19961245-content"><p>If I must be entirely serious, then I must say that I think that Jodi&#39;s idea is silly.  It advances the idea of competing ressentiments between two groups: the group of people who publish such articles, and the group of &quot;left academics&quot; who react to and are annoyed by these articles.  Nowhere within this scheme are the ideas that perhaps the individuals publishing such articles are individuals without significant party feeling or common background beyond that of being English professors, or that perhaps some of them are &quot;left academics&quot;, or that perhaps those annoyed are not themselves all &quot;left academics&quot; (whatever that means), or that perhaps -- as Scott originally said -- just about everyone is annoyed by a particular sort of bad article.  It&#39;s the creation of a group of &quot;such article&quot; writers so that you can ascribe ressentiment to them, then a compensating ressentiment in your own group.  It&#39;s the creation of two groups, one of which you comfortingly belong to -- the leftist one.  The basic political distinction is between friend and enemy (what is the attraction of Schmitt&#39;s simplistic and archaic politics, anyway?) so in order to have a group of fake friends, you must create one of fake enemies.</p>

<p>Scott came very close to saying &quot;*you* people tend to say this&quot; in his response, of course, which is why I teased him about it.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-19964471-content"><p>I don&#39;t see what&#39;s silly about it. I think the point that some of us overreact to the article, rather than just simply find it annoying, is noteworthy and that Nietzsche&#39;s notion of ressentiment tells us why. I don&#39;t think everyone who is simply annoyed by it manifests ressentiment--and I didn&#39;t say or imply that they do.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also the case that some publications continue to publish ideas that are already familiar rather than ignoring them. And it&#39;s the case that there are some people who continue to have the feelings that lead them to write these articles. I am grouping them together (or agreeing with John Ransom&#39;s grouping) under the category of ressentiment. What&#39;s weird about that? We make groupings all the time: writers of chic-lit, left intellectuals, lacanians, English professors. In fact, the grouping John made and I affirmed didn&#39;t rely on a friend/enemy opposition at all because it noted how each groups manifested ressentiment, a manifestation that would cut across a divide to create a new grouping of those manifesting ressentiment. The ressentiments, then, are not competing but something shared.</p>

<p>Sure folks are left out of this scheme--there were never any claims that it was all encompassing. </p></span>

On this day seven years ago, in the middle of an afternoon thunderstorm, she hogtied some poor soul for life. I hear word he doesn't much mind. Even seems to enjoy it.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/future.html"><span><strong>Until The Recent Future, That Is</strong> A sentence from an article I'm reading: This would be like saying that there are no other planets outside the solar system, because we did not (until recently) have powerful enough telescopes to observe them ... Near as I can tell, that discovery happened in 2002, four years after the article appeared. The author banked that people would be reading his book around 2002 and won. But what happens to that parenthetical &quot;until recently&quot; as the book ages? How will readers in 3018—seventeen years after first contact—react to it? What will they make of our 21st Century gambles? In order to appease whatever sense of humor their nanorganic hive-mind assemblages retain, I'll be larding my work with conjectures likely to be true by the time a member of the collective distributes its photonitelepathic imprint. I'll start by slipping in references inspired by current events: This would be like saying that people could still live in Lebanon, because (until recently) it had houses and an infrastructure ... I'll exhaust near-future history quickly. (Ain't to0 much important happening right now.) Then the fun'll start: This would be like saying that no clone of Thomas Jefferson could ever become President, because (until recently) the Supreme Court had not decided that the 22nd Amendment only applied to the original ... This would be like saying that no colony of human-Qiso'Jovian hybrids could successfully invade a HumaCorp-controlled planet, because (until recently) none had TelePortal™ technology capable of penetrating a military-grade ImpeneDome™ ... This would be like saying that Jesus would never return again, because (until recently) no one believed He would also incarnate in non-photonitelepathic space ... I still have oodles of future history to cover—not to mention chapters to write—so consider The Suggestion Box officially open.</span></a></div>
