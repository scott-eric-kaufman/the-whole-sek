If you'll remember—by which I mean &quot;skim your translated edition of The Canterbury Tales&quot;—the NPT contains 7,392 frame narratives nested, like Russian dolls, around a beast fable about a cock named Chauntecleer who refuses to listen his dreams or wives. So a fox takes him by surprise, grabs him by the mouth and scoots into the woods. Chauntecleer, clever cock he is, tricks the fox into saying something. The fox's mouth momentarily agape, Chauntecleer flap-flap-flaps into the bosom of a nearby tree. That's all the plot you need to know to understand the horrors to follow.

			<p>From The Little Womedievalist—who's apparently hard at work on something about the <a href="http://www.luminarium.org/medlit/nunspriest.htm"><em>Nun's Priest's Tale</em></a>—comes this week's most terrifying sample of academic prose.&nbsp; If you'll remember—by which I mean &quot;skim your translated edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393925870/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Canterbury Tales</em></a>&quot;—the <em>NPT </em>contains 7,392 frame narratives nested, like Russian dolls, around a beast fable about a cock named Chauntecleer who refuses to listen his dreams or wives.&nbsp; So a fox takes him by surprise, grabs him by the mouth and scoots into the woods.&nbsp; Chauntecleer, clever cock he is, tricks the fox into saying something.&nbsp; The fox's mouth momentarily agape, Chauntecleer flap-flap-flaps into the bosom of a nearby tree.&nbsp; </p>

<p>That's all the plot you need to know to understand the horrors to follow.&nbsp; (But I recommend reading the afore-linked tale in its entirety.&nbsp; This Chaucer fellow ain't half bad.&nbsp; A <a href="http://houseoffame.blogspot.com/">decent blogger</a>, even.)&nbsp; So, the fox has the cock in his mou—crap, I gave the game away, didn't I?&nbsp; No choice but to present the offending sentence then:</p><blockquote><p>Because the word &quot;cock&quot; passes through the throat of the fox, the thing it signifies will not.</p></blockquote><p>When I talk about the rigors of deconstruction being lost on literary scholars, <em>this </em>is what I'm referencing.&nbsp; You see the priceless irony here?&nbsp; As soon as the fox utters the signifier &quot;cock,&quot; he invokes the presence of that which is absent ... <em>only it isn't!&nbsp; The cock was in his mouth when he said &quot;cock&quot;!&nbsp; Therefore, because the word &quot;cock&quot; passes through the throat of the fox, the thing it signifies</em>—<em>Chauntecleer</em>—<em>will not!&nbsp; </em></p>

<p>Where to even begin?&nbsp; Chill, my friend, <em>chill</em>.&nbsp; I have an idea.&nbsp; How about I begin the with the moment when uttering the word &quot;cock&quot; dispossesses said cock from the fox's mouth?</p><blockquote><p>This cok, that lay upon the foxes bak,<br />In al his drede unto the fox he spak,<br />And seyde, sire, if that I were as ye,<br />Yet sholde I seyn, as wys God helpe me,<br />Turneth agayn, ye proude cherles alle!<br />A verray pestilence upon yow falle!<br />Now am I come unto the wodes syde;<br />Maugree youre heed, the cok shal heere abyde.<br />I wol hym ete, in feith, and that anon!<br />The fox answerde, in feith, it shal be don.<br />And as he spak that word, al sodeynly<br />This cok brak from his mouth delyverly,<br />And heighe upon a tree he fleigh anon. </p>

<p>[This cock, which lay across the fox's back,<br />In all his fear unto the fox did clack<br />And say: &quot;Sir, were I you, as I should be,<br />Then would I say (as God may now help me!),<br />'Turn back again, presumptuous peasants all!<br />A very pestilence upon you fall!<br />Now that I've gained here to this dark wood's side,<br />In spite of you this cock shall here abide.<br />I'll eat him, by my faith, and that anon!'&quot;<br />The fox replied: &quot;In faith, it shall be done!&quot;<br />And as he spoke that word, all suddenly<br />This cock broke from his mouth, full cleverly,<br />And high upon a tree he flew anon.] </p></blockquote><p>Wait one cotton-picking minute here.&nbsp; I'm confused.&nbsp; I was promised that &quot;because the word 'cock' passes through the throat of the fox, the thing it signifies will not.&quot;&nbsp; I'm reading that section and you know what?&nbsp; I don't see the fox mutter, sputter or otherwise address the cock as &quot;cock&quot; in that passage.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Which came first, I wonder, the sentence or the thought?</p>

<p>Because the sentence is damn clever.&nbsp; The thought ... not so much.&nbsp; I <em>could</em> draw larger conclusions from this monstrous sentence.&nbsp; I <em>could</em> note that it seems designed to shock puerile minds into paying attention to the deconstructive gymnastics this deconstructive embarrassment practices.&nbsp; Instead, I'll leave you to parse the sentence immediately preceding that brute:</p><blockquote><p>When the cock sings with his eyes closed, whatever his voice might be referring to in the external world has disappeared.</p></blockquote><p>Yes, that <em>is </em>the previous sentence.&nbsp; </p>

<p>No, I've no clear idea of its relation to the nonsense following it.</p>

		<span id="comment-20745905-content"><p>Alex, I certainly think there&#39;s a <i>good</i> deconstructive reading to be had here, this just isn&#39;t it.  </p>

<p>S.D., the fox has Chauntecleer slung over his shoulder, like a hunting with a duck, I imagine.  As for the overall argument, it&#39;s a fairly straightforward, mid &#39;80s artifact, with a thesis along the lines of &quot;you can tell Chaucer&#39;s smart and worth reading because he&#39;s a proto-Derridian.&quot;  Some more quotes:</p>

<blockquote>The comic errors [in <i>NPT</i>] have come to exemplify the dangerous nature of signs for Chaucer.

<p>[<i>snip</i>]</p>

<p>Ths scene of the need situates language at its threshold, as if it has just emerged from animal sound, with need itself an origin for language.  In the sense, then, that &quot;the more rational&quot; a language is, &quot;the better it expresses need&quot; (Derrida, <i>Grammatology</i> 242), Chauntecleer&#39;s argument for the truthfulness of dreams &quot;expresses&quot; his plight before the &quot;glowynge eyen tweye,&quot; expands and justifies the groaning, supplements its deficient ability to control.</p>

<p>[<i>snip</i>]</p>

<p>&#39;There is nothing outside the text&#39; (Derrida, <i>Grammatology</i> 158) is a possibility already latent in medieval sign theory itself.</p>

<p>[<i>snip</i>]</p>

<p>In short, the <i>Tale</i> threatens to show that supplementation has, in the phrase Derrida owes to Heidegger, always already begun.</p>

<p>[<i>snip</i>]</p>

<p>The multiple oppositions within the poem ... may remain hinged, with no ontologically proven side able finally to reduce its opposite, for the reason that such doubling inheres in the sign itself.</blockquote></p>

<p>The author&#39;s obviously a bright guy, but his article&#39;s really of its time.  </p></span>

The guy knows where he wants to go and there&#39;s no stopping him; I wouldn&#39;t like to get between a hungry deconstructionist and his (sous rature) dinner. A lovely phrase I read somewhere about the latter-day decons came to mind: &quot;the jejeune logophobia of the epigoni&quot; - not quite what&#39;s going on here, but I love the phrase so much, I&#39;ll use any excuse to quote it. I had thought about the slung over shoulder thing, but is that how foxes really carry things they&#39;ve caught? I&#39;m finding it hard to visualize it (wouldn&#39;t his head be twisted around too much?), but what do I know about foxes. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-20746590-content"><p>Scott, not to defend this critic&#39;s silly reading, but S.D. is right: the cock is at first slung over the fox&#39;s shoulder.  But in order for the cock to &quot;brak from [the fox&#39;s] mouth delyverly,&quot; we have to assume that at some point either (a) the fox put the cock into his mouth or (b) Chaucer isn&#39;t keeping track of where he put his cock.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think (b) is the case.  Pardon my transcultural ahistorcism for a moment, but these sorts of all-important ellisions are all over Native American &quot;trickster&quot; tales, especially Coyote stories.  As Anne Doueihi has argued in &quot;Inhabiting the Space Between Discourse and Story in Trickster Narratives,&quot; these ellisions appear to be moments where the *way* of telling the story mimics the shape-shifting and craftiness of the character.  </p>

<p>In any case, the cock says &quot;cock&quot; from within the mouth of the fox.  Which allows the cock to escape.  </p>

<p>Did cock even have the sexual meaning in middle English?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-20747000-content"><p>The Little Womedievalist informs me that &quot;cock&quot; doesn&#39;t have the sexual meaning at that time.  (So spake the MED.)  </p>

<p>S.D. and L.B., here&#39;s where the fox grabs him:</p>

<blockquote>And by the gargat hente chauntecleer,
And on his bak toward the wode hym beer</blockquote>

<p>He has him by the &quot;gargat,&quot; or throat, so presumably the rest of Chauntecleer&#39;s on his back.  I&#39;m trying and failing to find a picture of this, but having grown up around hunters, I know that when dogs have animals by the neck, they&#39;re trained to sort of sling them on their back.  (Not fully, mind you.)  However, the narrative doesn&#39;t make sense if the cock&#39;s transfered from mouth to back to mouth, as the second he&#39;s released from the fox&#39;s grip, he alights.  </p>

<p>All of that said, L.B., you&#39;re right that the word cock comes from the mouth of the fox <i>via</i> the cock, but that seems different than it coming from his throat ... or maybe I&#39;m just disinclined to give this scholar the benefit of the doubt (a likely scenario).</p></span>

		<span id="comment-20747455-content"><p>OK here’s my shot: </p>

<p>The cock invokes not just his own name but mimics the fox calling on God (&quot;I’ll eat him, by my faith&quot;) to grant final affirmation of the fox’s consumption of the signified (its very meatiness seeming to emphasize its extra-linguistic reality.) The fox then repeats, not the name of the to-be-eaten, but rather the final guarantor of meaning, the signifying currency-of-last-resort, God’s name. &quot;God&quot; (the Signifier and the &quot;faith&quot; in the world He has created) in a crescendo of significatory authority, goes from (mentioned parenthetically) to being-part-of-a-mimickry to appears-‘authentic’-to-the-subject-but-is-in-fact-unbeknownst-or-overlooked-by-him-<br />
just-a-mimicry-of-a-mimicry. And the result of all this reaffirmation, this reauthorization of the whole process of signification...is that the (so-called) signified flutters away, never to be consumed in all its satisfying plenitude.</p>

<p>(The 80s fashion-victim scholar is on to something but doesn&#39;t see Just How High Up This Thing Goes...(think of the Donald Sutherland scene by the Lincoln Memorial in &quot;JFK&quot;))</p>

<p>So...everything depends upon how you read what’s in the brackets. Is it a genuine little aside by the cock, muttered under his breath, a private prayer at the moment of danger, or is it just a shammed moment of the &quot;fox&#39;s&quot; interiority still within the cock’s performance and so just a further thin layer of falsehood which paradoxically lends credence to his impersonation of the fox? If you had to read the piece aloud, you would have to decide one way or another, but with print&#39;s mute textuality, you get not to choose. Hurray! </p>

<p>Where does it flutter to? Above, upwards, in the direction of the Transcendental, only to alight, to skim the upper surface of...a &quot;dark wood.&quot; But the wood is not fully dark: it has light enough to allow us (who?) to discern the sign-tree on which the sign-cock briefly rests. (The endless chiarascuric play of the sign-system...By saying the &quot;dark wood&quot;, GC is simultaneously saying the &quot;not-dark wood&quot;...) And then some more: the cock and the fox only exist within a social system – the cock is not just an unmarked object-in-the-world, but is already owned (by the &quot;presumptuous peasants&quot;), and this mark of ownership must be erased before it can be eaten. And...that social system, the cock, the fox and all are surrounded (circum-scribed, if you will) by the aforementioned dark woods of signification. This immanent Lichtung which we inhabit, this place within the woods, is not a set of correspondence-truths, but rather a place where we humans can find brief dominion over the animals and the signs, long enough to eat our dinner. Bon appetit.<br />

		<span id="comment-20752330-content"><p>On third thought, what this beast fable *really* is is Homi Bhabha avant le lettre.  The cock subverts the fox by mimicking his voice.  Omigod!  Or maybe Chaucer was the medieval Zizek: the interior voice of conscience is really the Real Voice we confront from the Outside.  The Real is the Voice of the Cock.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, I hadn&#39;t noticed, despite my comment about Tricksters, how similar this story is to the tale of the signifying monkey.  If Chauntecleer isn&#39;t black, he&#39;s certainly part of the African-American signifyin(g) tradition.  But maybe this is just Norman Mailer speaking through my own White Negro gargat: even mentioning a Black Cock is enough to rejuvenate Western culture (Or as Saint Jack would say, &quot;Go man go, Charlie Parker is the Mute Beat Chicken Buddha of the Long Dark American Night of the Soul&quot;).</p>

Worse than that, even. Some people spin stupendous yarns on the spot. I spin my wheels. Unsuccessfully. Too much stupid gunk in the gears ... by which I mean, too much stupid-gunk in the gears, preventing my wheels from even spinning. My remedy? Mandatory close-readings. Cold. No preparation. No background research. I'm practicing a radical New Criticism here, the kind which only ever existed in the minds of its opponents. I hope to be a good Horacian and entertain while edifying, but fear that until I get better at this, the entertainment will be in the mocking and the edification nil. The first victim will be Robert Browning's &quot;Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister.&quot; Of all the poems ever written since the dawn of time, I chose to open with this one because I've always had an affinity for Browning ... and because, since it's a dramatic monologue, the sad skills I've acquired reading novels may apply. Below the fold you'll find the temporarily autotelic little bugger as well as my New Critical gloss on it: Gr-r-r—there go, my heart's abhorrence! Water your damned flower-pots, do! If hate killed men, Brother Lawrence, God's blood, would not mine kill you! What? your myrtle-bush wants trimming? (5) Oh, that rose has prior claims— Needs its leaden vase filled brimming? Hell dry you up with its flames! At the meal we sit together; Salve tibi! I must hear (10) Wise talk of the kind of weather, Sort of season, time of year: Not a plenteous cork crop: scarcely Dare we hope oak-galls, I doubt; What's the Latin name for &quot;parsley&quot;? (15) What's the Greek name for &quot;swine's snout&quot;? Whew! We'll have our platter burnished, Laid with care on our own shelf! With a fire-new spoon we're furnished, And a goblet for ourself, (20) Rinsed like something sacrificial Ere 'tis fit to touch our chaps— Marked with L. for our initial! (He-he! There his lily snaps!) Saint, forsooth! While Brown Dolores (25) Squats outside the Convent bank With Sanchicha, telling stories, Steeping tresses in the tank, Blue-black, lustrous, thick like horsehairs, —Can't I see his dead eye glow, (30) Bright as 'twere a Barbary corsair's? (That is, if he'd let it show!) When he finishes refection, Knife and fork he never lays Cross-wise, to my recollection, (35) As do I, in Jesu's praise. I the Trinity illustrate, Drinking watered orange pulp— In three sips the Arian frustrate; While he drains his at one gulp! (40) Oh, those melons! if he's able We're to have a feast; so nice! One goes to the Abbot's table, All of us get each a slice. How go on your flowers? None double? (45) Not one fruit-sort can you spy? Strange!—And I, too, at such trouble, Keep them close-nipped on the sly! There's a great text in Galatians, Once you trip on it, entails (50) Twenty-nine...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/08/a_gigantic_nona.html"><span><strong>A Gigantic Non-Announcement &amp; a Desperate Plea for Help</strong> A tremendous, life-altering announcement sits slightly over the horizon, but the details are not mine to divulge yet. If everything falls into place, the odds of my making a career of this academic thing have improved fifty-fold this weekend. So for now, I blog happy ... and all the world's tiniest violins play for me alone. Before I continue, I want to apologize for indulging in a bit of meta-blogging, but I'm working on my MLA presentation and need a little help. For the first time in months I spent 20 minutes digging through my profile on Technorati. I did so not from the rank vanity I'm barely six centimeters (if even) above, but because in the comments to this item I learned that the ratio of spam logs to actual blogs is 28:1. Pace this, I wondered how many of the blogs which link here are spam blogs, and whether that could account for the fact that if you look at Technorati's Acephalous page, you learn that I have 695 links from 264 blogs and that 954 blogs link to me. I've confessed my mathematical shortcomings before, but even I can see that 954 and 695 are different numbers. Anyone know how to account for the difference? Because reconciling these numbers could change some of the conclusions I draw during the MLA panel. I don't want to stand before the masses unaware of the egg on my face. All of which is only to say that I'm not sure I trust Technorati (or anyone who who fails worse than I at Excusing My Dear Aunt Sally). So if you've linked to me of late, drop me a line via email or in the comments below. Tomorrow afternoon I'll combine all the links of those who contact me with all the ones I can find by other means, in order to gauge the relation between my potential and actual readership. I know, you can barely contain your excitement at the prospect. But I promise that as soon as I tame this beast, you'll suffer no more meta-posts from these quarters. (Or any others I may inhabit.)</span></a></div>
