        <meta name="description" content="Octavia Butler's Fledgling disappoints. Exuberant popular reviewers must have forgotten the territory she covered in the Xenogenesis books. Only I'm not sure how they would have since she basically rewrote them in Fledgling. Not that I want to speak ill of the recently departed . . . or even of Fledgling. Had it been written before the Xenogenesis novels it would've compelled me to read every other word she's written. Only it wasn't. I've read that a crippling case of writer's block prevented her from completing the Parable series. Reading Fledgling I got the impression that she thought she could hurdle that block by rewriting earlier, better novels. Maybe she could've. We'll never know. I should say that I don't begrudge her this rewriting. I do the same thing everyday: I pull up my dissertation and rewrite the last paragraph I'd written so as to reoccupy the headspace in which I had written it. She thought she could find her gift again by recasting the Oankali as vampires. The human-Oankali dynamic became the human-vampire dynamic. The narrator is an African-American woman who is a half-human and half-the-other . . . a hybrid whose hybridity drives the narrative to its inevitable melancholic-but-hopeful conclusion. To be fair, there are only two sexes in Fledgling; but the structural relations of symbiont to alien are identical . . . as are the benefits of that relationship. Butler traces the complexity with the same deft hand responsible for the Xenogenesis books but it's the same complexity. I admired it as much this time as I had the first but the book lacks that spark . . . that moment in which a nebulous everything clicks into place. Walter Benjamin writes of the night sky suddenly aligning random stars into a collocation of constellations . . . the moment when all the implications are finally tallied and everything makes the sense it should have all along. That is what Fledgling lacks. Brilliant, certainly, but familiarly so. Those stars had already clicked into place. I had intended this to be a substantial review of Fledgling. Only I don't want to spoil what little there is to spoil. It's the only pleasure you'll take from the book. Especially when you consider this was supposed to be her priming the pump for the bigger and better things. Finally, I feel obliged to note that you should wait until the Warner paperback comes out to read Fledgling. I read on Nalo Hopkinsons' blog that Butler always published her hardcovers with small presses before turning over the mass market paperbacks to Warner.

<p>But <i>Parable of the Talents</i> may be her best novel, better even than <i>Xenogenesis</i>, and that&#39;s saying something.  I can&#39;t think of a book I was more looking forward to than the final <i>Parable</i> novel.  I mean, I&#39;m quite eagerly anticipating the Wachowiski&#39;s <i>V for Vendetta</i>, say; but that&#39;s not in the class of anticipation.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-14905739-content"><p>*nods* _Fledgling_ is kind of a romp.  I really enjoyed it, but I also recognised that it had a lot of elements familiar from her previous work.  When she came to Toronto during the tour to promote _Fledgling,_ she said that she&#39;d become discouraged from seeing the things she wrote about in the two &quot;Parable&quot; books appearing on the news as very distressing reality.  She felt she needed a break before going on to the third &quot;Parable&quot; book, so she wrote something that was fun.  It made me giggle, because Octavia&#39;s &quot;fun&quot; is still more meaty than many other authors&#39; &quot;serious&quot; books.</p></span>

<p>Nalo, you&#39;ve hit it squarely: it was a &quot;weak&quot; Butler novel, but as it is the last Butler novel, I felt like I willed myself to enjoy it more than I actually did.  Still brilliant--the word &quot;meaty&quot; aptly captures the complexity of the social relations in the novel--but likely not what the next <i>Parable</i> book would&#39;ve been.  I can&#39;t help but second Adam&#39;s suggestion that her career had an upward trajectory, and that her best work was still to come.  (They probably heard that sigh in Switzerland.)</p></span>

For whatever reason I've been having a ball writing these little scenes. The quality will improve. I promise. Now for a couple of quick notes: First: I've a new post up on the Valve which contains roughly the first 80 percent of tomorrow night's public lecture. Read it and tell me what you think. Second: I sincerely thank the person who clicked on an Amazon link and purchased $1,432.91 in baby paraphernalia. That is by far the easiest $57.32 I've ever earned. Feel free to splurge on one of these , which you can roll up to this when you're not too busy watching this on one of these . Third: I'm thinking of a site redesign now that Acephalous is officially one year old. (I forgot to wish the old bird a happy birthday. I'd be a terrible parent.) Jonathan frequently complains about the colors of the text and body. I like them but he thinks they're unreadable. What about you? Would you prefer something more transparent? Or simply something different and easier on the eyes? Or is she fine as is?</span></a></div>

Proposed Special Session for MLA '06 (Philadelphia, 12/27-12/30/06). What is the place of revenge in the history of the novel? What formal opportunities and challenges does it present? What cultural work do revenge narratives do? 500-word abstracts by March 15. E-mail submissions to Daniel Hack (preferably not as attachments). The latter emphasis is both mine and awesome.
