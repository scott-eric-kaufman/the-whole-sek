There was such a thing as William Graham Sumner, and his collected essays bear the title Social Darwinism, but those essays were collected in and published in 1963.

Darwin's theory of natural selection was elegant, but prior to the Modern Synthesis scientists lacked a means of proving that it could exist in nature. When was it formulated? Between 1936 and 1942.

The editor of those essays was following the lead established by the historian Richard Hofstadter, whose <em>Social Darwinism in American Thought </em>(1944) identified Sumner as the brains behind the social Darwinist movement in the Progressive Era. The problem is that there wasn&#39;t a social Darwinist movement during the Progressive Era. I&#39;m not just kicking against the pricks here—as <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/08/stick_it_to_the.html" target="_self">people writing dissertations are wont to do</a>—as will become clear if you ask yourself a simple question:</p>
<p>When was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_synthesis" target="_self">the Modern Synthesis</a> formulated?</p>
<p>The Modern Synthesis, if you don&#39;t know, is the combination of Mendelian genetics with Darwinian evolutionary theory, and represents the moment when the previously theoretical Darwinian model finally found itself a mechanism of transmission. Darwin&#39;s theory of natural selection was elegant, but prior to the Modern Synthesis scientists lacked a means of proving that it could exist in nature. When was it formulated? Between 1936 and 1942. Why is that significant?</p>
<p>Because prior to the Modern Synthesis there was little consensus as to the driving force behind the development of species. Russian scientists, for example, were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism" target="_self">working under Lamarckian assumptions</a> about the heritability of acquired characteristics well into the 1960s. (The had an ideological commitment to keeping the Lamarckian faith after the Modern Synthesis, but eventually even they relented.) Point being, during the Gilded Age and Progressive Era, Darwinian thought wasn&#39;t the dominant strain of evolutionary theory. It lacked the evidence required to back up its elegance, and so its status in the scientific community was as tenuous then as its competitors are now. Vernon Kellogg, then president of Stanford (<a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/07/only-theres-no-such-thing-as-social-darwinism/comment-page-1#comment-302154">or not</a>?), wrote a book entitled <em>Darwinism Today </em>(1908) that basically argued that there really wasn&#39;t any. It devoted itself to explicating &quot;the various new theories of species-forming with ... names, such as heterogenesis, orthogenesis, metakinesis, geographic isolation, biologic isolation, organic selection, or orthoplasty.&quot; So why do we associate Darwinism with this period?</p>
<p>Because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_history" target="_self">the Whigs and their history</a>. The aforementioned Hofstadter wrote <em>Social Darwinism in American Thought</em> in 1944 in order to create a bogeyman whose existence would justify the policies of the New Deal. From what Stephen J. Gould called the &quot;maximal diversity&quot; of evoultionary thought during the Gilded Age and Progressive Era, Hofstadter selected those thinkers whose work contained implications dire enough that politicians in the 1940s could point to them to frighten the masses. Darwinism, as I demonstrated above, wasn&#39;t regnant during the period, much less the social application of it, but Hofstadter had handed New Deal liberals their bogeyman and they weren&#39;t about to give it up.</p>
<p>Ironically, the scientific community bolstered Hofstadter&#39;s claim during the centennial of the <em>Origin </em>in 1959. In a book titled <em>Darwin&#39;s Century</em>, Loren Eiseley and his fellow scientists created a teleological narrative of Darwinism&#39;s development in which all evolutionary thinkers were groping their way towards the Modern Synthesis. Which is ironic because the key insight of Darwinian thought is that development isn&#39;t teleological—that natural selection isn&#39;t based on forethought and doesn&#39;t working according to a plan. Eiseley and his colleagues transformed the development of Darwinian thought into the stuff of Intelligent Design, and when that narrative was welded onto Hofstadter&#39;s, the result was the impression that Darwinism reigned supreme during the Gilded Age and Progressive Era.</p>
<p>It didn&#39;t. It only seems to have because people have forgotten all the other evolutionary theories that were in play at the time, the most prominent of which was Lamarckian, not Darwinian, prompting prominent medical thinkers (and popular novelists) <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/the_best_quotat.html" target="_self">like Silas Weir Mitchell to declare</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have sometimes been led to think that over brain-work tends not only to stunt the body and to contract the pelvis, but, <em>by the law of evolution</em>, to develop bigger headed offspring, or at least offspring with heads relatively disproportioned to the pelvis of the mother.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s correct. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silas_Weir_Mitchell" target="_self">most prominent neurologist in America</a> opposed educating women because they would become smarter, pass on their larger brains to their children, then die during childbirth. Outside of giraffes, it&#39;s difficult to find a more classic formulation of Lamarckian thought. I could go on for ages—or pages, <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/files/dissertationabstract.gif" target="_self">hundreds of them</a>—but I think I&#39;ve established that &quot;the Social Darwinism movement&quot; is an ahistorical construct designed to justify policies and theories with which I otherwise agree.</p>

<p>Your argument, it seems to me, is a worthwhile point in terms of intellectual history and the history of science, but you need to clarify it. Was there a body of thought, significant if not dominant, during the gilded age and progressive era which was based around the proposition that naked competition would produce the fittest classes of persons, who would then obtain political, cultural and economic power? In other words, is it truly a bogey man, as you argue, or a real phenomenon, identified by a misnomer perhaps and in need of refinement and disambiguation, as the wiki-kids say, but an actual and significant phenomenon none the less. It seems to me more of the latter. I&#39;m no Americanist or Intellectual Historian, but the portion of the material I know best, related to the devolpment of Scientific Racism, would suggest to me that there was in fact a broad current of evolutionary thought applied to the social realm which, in fact, shaped both the terms of political debate and the direction of political policy.<br />
 <br />
In which case, I think what you want to argue is that Social Darwinism wasn&#39;t, strictly speaking, Darwinian, not that it didn&#39;t exist.</p></span>

I first read a version of this during my BBS days, but as you can tell from DISADVENTURE!, DISADDENDUM!, DISMORALIZED!, DISINSOMNIA!, WHARTON!, GRADING! and DISBELIEF! the form stuck with me. It's an inspiring tale of nerd from a time when nerdiness lacked its current cultural capital. So without further ado I return to the living Internets the glory that is The Tale of Eric and the Dread Gazebo.] ED: You see a well groomed garden. In the middle, on a small hill, you see a gazebo. ERIC: A gazebo? What color is it? ED: (pauses) It's white, Eric. ERIC: How far away is it? ED: About 50 yards. ERIC: How big is it? ED: (pauses) It's about 30 ft across, 15 ft high, with a pointed top. ERIC: I use my sword to detect good on it. ED: It's not good, Eric. It's a gazebo. ERIC: (pauses) I call out to it. ED: It won't answer. It's a gazebo. ERIC: (pauses) I sheathe my sword and draw my bow and arrows. Does it respond in any way? ED: No, Eric, it's a gazebo. ERIC: I shoot it with my bow. (rolls for hit) What happened? ED: There is now a gazebo with an arrow sticking out of it. ERIC: (pauses) Wasn't it wounded? ED: OF COURSE NOT. IT'S A GAZEBO. ERIC: But that was a +3 arrow! ED: It's a gazebo, Eric, a GAZEBO. If you really want to try to destroy it, you could try to chop it with an axe, I suppose, or you could try to burn it, but I don't know why anybody would even try. It's a FUCKING GAZEBO. ERIC: I run away. ED: It's too late. You've awakened the gazebo. It catches you and eats you. ERIC: (reaching for his die) Maybe I'll roll up a fire-using mage so I can avenge my Paladin.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/07/walking-and-talking-louie-1.html"><span><strong>Walking and talking with Louie and Liz</strong> Jim Emerson's appreciation of Louie captures something I don't think I quite did in my initial comments about the relationship of form to content in The Dark Knight Rises. The episode, &quot;Daddy's Girlfriend II,&quot; largely consists of a slow-motion Sorkinian walk-and-talk around New York City. The key features of the typical Sorkinian walk-and-talk are present in the linked clip: the characters approach a camera at a brisk clip and end up in a medium or medium close-up with a shallow focus. The world recedes into blurriness because the emphasis is on the dialogue and the characters' reaction to it. The blurriness also imparts an unearned importance to the dialogue because it creates the impression that the characters have no time to waste and people with no time to waste are very important people. The viewer knows exactly where to look and how long to be looking there because there are, essentially, only faces in the frames and the one with words departing its mouth is the one to be paying attention to. But whatever narrative momentum the Sorkinian variation provides to what amounts to endless conversations between bureaucrats in the hallways of the Circumlocution Office comes at a high price: boredom. Sorkin's shows are exhausting not because of the amount of information his characters breathlessly provide, but because Sorkin leaves his audience with nothing to do. In any given sequence, he indicates exactly where we should be looking and dictates exactly how long our eyes should linger there. Thinking is not required to watch an episode of Sorkin's shows, and not thinking for forty-two consecutive minutes dulls the wits. Not so with Louie. The stills Emerson pulled from the episode bear this out. Consider this medium shot of Louie and his date, Liz, stopping-and-chatting in front of a pool hall: Note the depth of field. We can clearly see what's happening behind Louie and Liz, and even though the director, one Louis C.K., wants us to pay attention to the conversation. The movement of the pool players—which occurs, significantly, in the dead center of the screen—threatens distraction throughout the entire conversation. Our attention shifts from the conversation to the pool and back to the conversation and then back to the pool. It makes for uncomfortable viewing because we aren't entirely sure what we're supposed to be paying attention to. But it makes for compelling viewing for the same reason: when we don't know what we're supposed to be paying attention to, we start scouring the frame for visual cues. As our eyes dart from Louie to Liz to the pool players, unsure of where to find safe harbor, it becomes possible for us to be surprised. Because when we don't know where to look it becomes possible to not see something coming. The formal qualities of this stopping-and-chatting sequence create an awkwardness that borders on discomfort, but despite our misgivings we want to keep watching because we have no idea what might happen next. Do you know what that situation...</span></a></div>
