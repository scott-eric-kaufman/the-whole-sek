<p>Writing a blog post is an easy way to become familiar with the processing of writing blog posts to get published.&nbsp; The short blog post can take on many different forms and one should allow them a measurable degree of creative control regarding format and structure.</p>

<p>Developing an idea for your post is the first step.&nbsp; Choose an idea that excites you and ignites some passion and then define it with these important components.</p>

<p><strong>Words</strong></p>

<p>The words you use in a post are important to conveying the meaning of your idea.&nbsp; Diction is important because you don't want to sound stupid to your reader and at the same time you shouldn't have to explain what the idea of your post is.&nbsp; The reader should be able to learn and recognize the idea through the post.</p>

<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>

<p>At first, writing a short blog post from the first person point of view seems simple, you just write as if you were the person who has the idea.&nbsp; However, when getting further involved, there is more to consider.&nbsp; There are only two different kinds of first person narrators: &quot;I&quot; who tells his or her own idea, and &quot;I&quot; who tells the idea of someone else they know.&nbsp; Additionally, there are many other techniques for such styles you can use to write a good short blog post.</p>

<p><strong>Style and Tone</strong></p>

<p>Style and tone is the language or dialogue you use that is right for your post.&nbsp; Always use words to let the reader know what's happening whenever possible.&nbsp; To write well, simpler is usually stronger and less is most often more.&nbsp; Finally, choose the best word, the one that is closest to your meaning and gives the clearest image of that meaning possible.&nbsp; If you can't think of a word, use a thesaurus.</p>

<p>Now that you have some insight into how to write a short blog post, the next step is to start writing your short blog post.&nbsp; The concept of a beginning, middle and an end can be considered but keep in mind that many interesting short blog posts don't take that linear approach.&nbsp; Reading short blog posts is a great way to learn about them and the many different styles in which they can be written.&nbsp; Writing your short blog post should be a creative process that reveals itself to you as you go along.&nbsp; As you grow into the writing process you will know what is right and what works because it will organic to you when it does.</p></blockquote>

















<center><span style="font-size: 1.4em;"><br /><a href="http://authoridentity.com/index.php/pages/FAQs/"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></a><br /><br /></span></center><blockquote><p><strong>Question: </strong>Is it easier to get published by being a short blog post author or by being a long blog post author?</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong>To get published as a short blog post author is easier for the simple reason that there are more avenues available for short blog post authors to get published.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>Can I submit multiple short blog posts to get published with Acephalous Identity?</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Yes, however we are only accepting one short blog post per author which doesn't mean that we wouldn't be willing to publish other short blog posts of yours in the future.&nbsp; <strong>If you have posts of different genres you would like to submit we would be more than happy to accept those.&nbsp; However, don't submit multiple posts of the same genre.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>Do I have to email my post or can I save it to a disk?</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong>You must send the post via email to get published.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>Do I need to send a hard copy of my post?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No.&nbsp; We publish almost all our blog posts on the computer.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>Do I need an agent?</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong>In most instances agents do not negotiate for the sale of short blog posts.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>I'm confused at how the royalties work.&nbsp; How much will I get paid as a blogger?</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Because this is a group blog, each blog will have multiple authors each with their own short blog post.&nbsp; The 10% royalty is then divded amongst the bloggers.&nbsp; This is on the high side of the royalties amongst blogging companies and we feel it is a generous percentage.</p>

<p>NWC, no, not spam, that&#39;s an actual line from the site.  I know, hard to believe, what with the spiraling paradox at its core.  But now that I&#39;m getting more and more interested in this <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/008811.html" rel="nofollow">unfolding scandal</a>, I&#39;m finding more spam-like material to mock.  I mean, <a href="http://cadyhayden.blogspot.com/2006/12/cady-haydens-biography.html" rel="nofollow">comedy gold</a>!  (And a fair bit of tragedy, and being-taken-advantage-of, if true; but I doubt it is, since so much of the language is identical to what&#39;s on the Author Identity site:</p>

<blockquote>Not only has she learned so much about the publishing industry from working with the team at Author Identity, but they are helping her with marketing ideas, book signings, readings and author&#39;s resources. After all, marketing is key in today&#39;s fast paced times and without it your story or book will have a shelf life longer than that of an old can of spam.

<p>The Shortcut has reached #2 on Amazon.com&#39;s Bestseller List!</blockquote></p>

<p>I mean, <em>seriously</em>?</p>

<p>Constructivist, we&#39;ll need to hear that at least three more times before we can judge the intellectual merit of your short blog post.  Your comment, however, we think we can work with.  It would fit perfectly in our forthcoming <em>Short Blog Comments</em>, which also includes works by XXX69XXX (&quot;Do u like hottie chickz?&quot;) and Wrenches (&quot;Everybody needs wrenches and I know where to find them&quot;).</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/04/the_warden_will.html"><span><strong>The Warden Will See You Now, Mr. Foucault</strong> (X-posted from the Valve ... and speaking of disciplining and punishing, the person who has been leaving inappropriate comments; signing me up for every spam mailing list imaginable; and sending me emails of unquestionably threatening content—I would like that person to know that I've logged his address; have filters many and mighty to stem that tide; and laughed when I saw that the emails had been sent from a work account.) Andrew Scull’s review of the new translation of Madness and Civilization is on more than a few people’s minds, and why not? Its relentless criticism of Foucault’s shoddy historiography is meant to provoke: [History], consequently, requires patience and a knowledge of details, and it depends on a vast accumulation of source material. Its “cyclopean monuments” are constructed from “discreet and apparently insignificant truths and according to a rigorous method”; they cannot be the product of “large and well-meaning errors.” In short, [history] demands relentless erudition. Sorry, wrong window—that there is Foucault extolling the virtues of a rigorous genealogy, not Scull criticizing him for his “isolation from the world of facts and scholarship.” I quote it now to dispel the notion that minor historical inaccuracies in Foucault’s work are of little consequence. Put bluntly, they matter; a little more argumentatively, they matter more than their counterparts in conventional histories, because the “effective history” Foucault champions in “Nietzsche, Genealogy, History” approaches “events in terms of their most unique characteristics, their most acute manifestations.” Foucauldian genealogy sweats the small stuff, as it’s in the minutiae that metahistory reveals the limits of its teleology. To say—as some have and others surely will—that the questionable citations and historical inaccuracies in Madness and Civilization in no way challenge the larger theory built upon them is powerfully stupid. Of course they do. Anyone who employs the Foucauldian theory of madness (however defined) must now seriously reconsider whether their work remains structurally sound. Perhaps the evidence they cited meets evidentiary standards; they are not only safe, their work helps validate the utility of the Foucauldian account. Even there, the problem of whether researchers found what they were looking for persists, i.e. had Foucault not coined his theory, they wouldn’t have found what they weren’t looking for. Still, the most dire of Scull’s critiques is that much of [Foucault’s] account of the internal workings and logic of the institutions of confinement, an account on which he lavishes attention, is drawn from their printed rules and regulations. But it would be deeply naive to assume that such documents bear close relationship to the realities of life in these places, or provide a reliable guide to their quotidian logic. As anyone who’s read a blurb of Discipline &amp; Punish knows, the difference between formal, institutional strictures and lived experience is of central importance to his thought. As he writes in “Nietzsche, Genealogy, History,” Rules are empty in themselves, violent and unfinalized; they are impersonal and can be bent to any purpose. Exactly right, Michel, which is why basing your first...</span></a></div>
