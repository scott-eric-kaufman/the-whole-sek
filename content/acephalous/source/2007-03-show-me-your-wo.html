Anyway, who&#39;s posting English curse words in foreign language posts on English language blogs? </p>

<p>Seems like the search results might be influenced just a bit by things like google&#39;s algorithm, the structure of various software programs (an instance on an individual post, same instance on an archive page, same instance on a category pages, etc.) and other factors that make this sort of a pointless exercise without help from those people who know what they&#39;re talking about who could conduct a methodology slam (as I said).</p></span>

		<span id="comment-62079704-content"><p>i also <a href="http://xnerg.blogspot.com/2007/03/askew-geshundteit.html" rel="nofollow">tried to re-create</a> ishmael&#39;s experiment, with similarly differing results.</p>

<p>i found only 1/3 as many swear words for my blog skippy as ishmael found, and i found twice as many swear words for little green footballs as ishmael found.</p>

<p>so by my anecdotal calculations, ishmael over-counted liberals by a factor of 300%, and undercounted conservatives by a factor of 50%.</p>

<p>plus, my blog, while cute, is certainly not among the 18 &quot;biggest liberal blogs,&quot; so i don&#39;t know why i was included (must have been my placing as a finalist for the 2005 weblog awards thanks for noticing).</p>

<p>and, ishmael conspicuoulsy left out protein wisdom starring jeff &quot;slap your face with my cock&quot; goldstein from the conservative side.</p>

<p>skewed?  ishmael makes john lott look like tim lambert.<br />

		<span id="comment-62143866-content"><p>Something is wrong with Google.</p>

<p>First, you have to be careful to reformat the search string so it doesn&#39;t misinterpret it. This means replacing &quot;quoted phrases&quot; with quoted-phrases, because otherwise, one of the two gets treated as required, while the other is not.</p>

<p>Secondly, there&#39;s the language issue. I checked not just the English-only results, but then compared it to restricting the search to each of the languages in turn. I found that there were only 10 posts on DailyKos that were not categorized by Google as English:</p>

<p>French:   2<br />
German:   1<br />
Japanese: 6<br />
Spanish:  1</p>

<p>Looking at the actual posts, the French ones really were in French, and the ones flagged as Japanese did have at least one small passage in Japanese. But I couldn&#39;t find any German or Spanish in the ones flagged as those two languages (but they were long threads).</p>

<p>So, according to Google 9,850 English posts plus 10 non-English posts adds up to 154,000 posts in total.</p>

<p>So, it&#39;s quite clear that something is wrong with the Google algorithm.</p>

<p>However, using the DailyKos website&#39;s own search functionality suggests that the English-only Google results are the really correct ones. This is what I found:</p>

<p>Stories:    1,261<br />
Diaries:      343<br />
Stories<br />
 &amp; Diaries:    28<br />
Comments:   8,845</p>

<p>If you consider that what Google indexes is the archives, which puts the story and comments all on one page, you can see why the comments number is very close to the number returned by Google (8,845 vs. Google&#39;s 9,850). If you add in the diaries, you get 9,188, which is reasonably close to the Google number. Even if you ignore the duplication, if you just add Stories + Comments, you get 10,106, which is only 256 fewer than Google, which could simply be the difference between a search of the live site and Google&#39;s index, which is always going to be somewhat behind (by a day or two). Indeed, a quick check of the number of comments with the 7 dirty words in them posted in the last 12 hours comes up with 224, which is pretty close to the difference between the DailyKos search and Google.</p>

<p>So, it&#39;s quite clear that the ALL LANGUAGE Google results are completely bogus.</p>

<p>Now, someone who really cares needs to do this same kind of search for the right-wing sites.</p>

<p>And a real comparison would be to throw out all the comments so you can compare the left with the right (where most sites don&#39;t have comments).</p>

<p>Another interesting comparison would be to weight the 7 dirty words posts as a portion of posts on the website in general. This could only be done with websites that have good search functions, but given that there&#39;s much more posting activity on the big liberal blogs than on the right, you&#39;ve got a much bigger pool in the first place.</p>

<p>But it won&#39;t be *me* who does all of this! I think that job is best left up to the people with something to prove, which is the hysterical right.</p></span>

It's not like I have anything better to do, what with being unemployed and all. Except! I'm not sure that deserved an exclamation, but roll with me. Except! I'm subbing for a friend tomorrow. In a poetry class. &quot;But Scott,&quot; you're thinking, &quot;time and again you've mentioned how little poetry you've read, and how you don't even know that much about it.&quot; True enough. Except! Guess which poem I'll be teaching tomorrow? Of all the poems in all the world, guess which one my friend happened to need someone to teach tomorrow? (ANSWER BELOW THE FOLD) Couldn't figure it out? Good Lord, people, it's not like I'm qualified to teach more than one poem.</span></a></div>

I spent all day waiting for it to start, then fell asleep ten minutes before it did. (The band broadcast it in its entirety last night, so I'm not asking for illegal downloads here; more like &quot;I taped Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart off KLSU last night, and now I'm sharing it with my friends.&quot;) What are the best books out there on philosophical atheism? A friend of mine recently finished The God Delusion and wants to read something more substantial on the matter. Since most of what I read is evolutionary theory or cultural appropriations of it, I'm not sure what the state of modern atheistic studies. To put it another way, I remember these two discussions of Dawkins' theological shortcomings, but don't remember much productive coming out of them. (The person who sent this email, I should add, was a long-time militant atheist who converted a few years back, so serious theological works dealing with atheism would be amenable.)</span></a></div>
