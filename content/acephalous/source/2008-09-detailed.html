		<span id="comment-130818102-content"><p>Yeah, stupid error.  But the fact remains that the Obama &quot;computer&quot; ad simply lets McCain re-emphasize his sacrifices to the nation, while making Obama seem like the kind of guy who giggles at the Special Olympics.  </p>

<p>Of course, it&#39;s a sign of McCain&#39;s computer illiteracy that he equates typing with computing.  I know plenty of professors with carpal tunnel who rarely type but who have amazing knowledge of digital technologies.  Sadly, though, there&#39;s that lovely, homely story about the McCains&#39; evening activities, where Cindy types while John dictates his emails.  </p>

<p>I suppose it&#39;s no longer even about *what* chinks Obama attacks in McCain&#39;s armor.  The Republicans are simply better at spinning all attacks into defenses of their victimhood and religious homilies.  </p>

<p>We attack Dubya&#39;s coke-and-booze-fueled escapades, and he gains support by turning it into a redemption story and conversion narrative.  If only Obama could spin his association with Ayers into a story of Christian forgiveness, a prodigal son story in which a man lost his way but found redemption in service to children and education, funded by conservatives and liberals alike.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s old hat, but that business about &quot;framing&quot; seems spot on here.</p></span>

And Luther, profs who don&#39;t type probably don&#39;t send much email themselves, no matter how much they know about digital tech. That&#39;s not the point. <br />
Ayers is a slime bag who&#39;s destroyed everyone he&#39;s ever come in contact with. Obama should have ditched that association years ago. </p></span>

Los Angeles Times confirms. CR’s reaction nails mine. Wallace was a brilliant, unpredictable author whose next book always could’ve been—what I mean to say, if Philip Roth dies, I’ll be upset, but it wouldn’t tie my stomach in knots. Roth’s entered the late-James stage of his career—his works refine and distill and what readers expect from them. With Wallace, there was still potential—his next book could’ve been another Infinite Jest, his next story could’ve been utterly unlike Oblivion, his next article could’ve done to McCain what Wallace’d done to lobsters. In short, his unwritten work could’ve been differently brilliant. Thoughts on suicide from a man who’s already committed it, in Oblivion’s “Good Old Neon”: I simply said, without going into anything like the level of detail I’ve given you (because my purpose in the letter was of course very different), that I was killing myself because I was an essentially fraudulent person who seemed to lack either the character or the firepower to find a way to stop even after I’d realized my fraudulence and the terrible toll it exacted . . . I also inserted that there was also a good possibility that, when all was said and done, I was nothing but another fact-track yuppie who couldn’t love, and that I found the banality of this unendurable, largely because I was evidently so hollow and insecure that I had a pathological need to see myself as somehow exceptional or outstanding at all times. Without going into much explanation or argument, I also told Fern that if her initial reaction to these reasons for my killing myself was to think I was being much, much too hard on myself, then she should know that I was already aware that that was the most likely reaction my note would produce in her, and had probably deliberately constructed the note to at least in part prompt just that reaction, just the way my whole life I’d often said and done things designed to prompt certain people to believe that I was a genuinely outstanding person whose personal standards were so high that he was far too hard on himself, which in turn made me appear attractively modest and unsmug, and was a big reason for my popularity with so many people in all different avenues of my life . . .” (173) Of this story, Dan Green wrote: At its core, “Good Old Neon” is indeed a story about a story, although we don’t know that until its conclusion. We do then discover, however, that “Good Old Neon” has been an impersonation by “David Wallace” of one of the latter’s high school classmates who died in a “fiery single-car accident he’d read about in 1991,” an attempt by the fictionalized author of Oblivion to “imagine what all must have happened to lead up to” that crash, why someone “David Wallace had back then imagined as happy and unreflective and wholly unhaunted by voices...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/its-the-last-wo.html"><span><strong>It's the last words, the true last.</strong> When I shared the story of my filing, Rich noticed I'd included links to some of my more memorable posts like a person shuttering the windows before closing shop. I considered it. Acephalous is, after all, a record of the final three years of my graduate career. They weren't good years. When the ledger closes they will likely stand as the worst three years of my life. (Summary.) Some of that misery I brought on myself—anything having to do with anything online—but all of it flattened me as only perfect shit-storms can. If I seemed to handle disaster well, it was only because my coping mechanism suits this medium. But my life hadn't always been a drinking song. What began with random cancer simply snowballed. For the past three years everything that could go wrong has done so spectacularly. I'm only a consummate storyteller because I've been given an obscene wealth of good material. The sooner I put all this behind me the better. So that was the end of Acephalous. What began with anger should end with joy. I have other places to punish random people with random thoughts and outstanding invitations to write elsewhere. I don't need a place that reminds me daily of times most awful. But Acephalous is mine. My voice. All the terrible things I recorded here were written in a voice whose development can be tracked. When I began, my voice wafted contagious—when others smelled it, they vomited too. Now I'm almost willing own up to the fact that the words I inhabit belong to me. That they have carried me to the threshold of my story since the door opened on my story. They almost say me. So I'm not closing shop yet. I've only written 1,734 posts. I've only received 18,357 comments. I must go on.</span></a></div>
