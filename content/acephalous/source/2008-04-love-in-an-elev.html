<p>Glad you asked.<br /> </p>





<p>Three years ago, I spent the better part of an hour trapped in an elevator.&nbsp; I'd rushed to the Humanities Instructional Building to make some copies before an 8 a.m. class and so instead of bounding up four flights of stairs I chose to take the elevator.*&nbsp; The elevators in HIB have a hitch.&nbsp; They overshoot every floor by about an inch and then ... hang ... there ... for a few beats before settling down.&nbsp; You get used to it.&nbsp; So I pressed the button, flew up four stories and was hanging there for a few beats ... and then a few more ... and then a few more ... and so with great annoyance (feigned ostentatiously for a nonexistent audience) I pressed the &quot;Door Open&quot; button.</p>

<p>But nothing happened.</p>

<p>Then I tried to go to the second floor and pressed the button and it lit up.</p>

<p>But nothing happened.</p>

<p>So I hit the button with the fire and the ax on it.&nbsp; The one that requires a key to work.&nbsp; Because maybe if they knew someone was fucking with important buttons in the elevator they would send someone to reprimand them.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But nothing happened.&nbsp; </p>

<p>At this point I was about five minutes into my own hanging.&nbsp; The damn thing wouldn't settle and so I panicked.&nbsp; I started pacing frantically and I checked my watch and I knew I would be late for class because you know and why am I still hanging inches above my point of egress but then wait a minute I'm an inch from the <em>floor </em>I want to be on but am in fact floating in an elevator shaft four stories up with a two-thousand pound counterweight aimed at my head and maybe I ought to take a breath or two and consider the seriousness of my predicament and so with great consideration I jumped in the air and slammed my feet into the floor. </p>

<p>I stomped and stomped thinking that I might loosen what normally unhitched and allowed the elevator to settle.&nbsp; Twenty minutes later I stopped.&nbsp; I figured the noise I'd made would alert someone that something was wrong with the elevators.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It didn't.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I resigned myself to skipping class on account of having the best of all possible excuses shortly after dismissing the possibility that there's only so much air in an elevator and there was no chance I'd suffocate and that the worse case scenario was that I'd drink my water and eat my granola bar and have to evacuate savagely into or onto an improvised something but despite the calm I convinced myself I felt it dawned on me that I was breathless and hyperventilating and that if this fucking elevator didn't fucking settle in the next fucking minute I'd fucking fuck decorum and press these useless fucking buttons like a rat with an orgasm-lever because I wasn't about to die in an elevator and then for no reason I could discern the damn thing settled.</p>

<p>With a pleasant ding.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The doors opened and five or six very annoyed people were looking at me.&nbsp; Seems they'd been waiting for the elevator.&nbsp; I like to imagine I snarled menacingly upon egress but I have a feeling my face registered my inchoate insanity.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I'd been trapped in the elevator for a little more than an hour all told but if you'd asked me then I'd just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrowing_of_Hell">harrowed hell</a>.&nbsp; Paumgarten's article doesn't quite articulate the sheer horror of being stuck in an elevator, which is less like a litigious inconvenience than an <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=QYhjF19zobIC&amp;dq=%22no+exit&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Wrk49oSkJV&amp;sig=gBGtI9reJdcKEFc_y6JU2yF9PWM">existentialist nightmare</a>.</p>

reach each staircase.&nbsp; The elevator goes up.&nbsp; The staircases crisscross
the building in a beautiful but&nbsp; maximally inconvenient manner.</span></p>

I remember spending hours there in my Humanities Honors two-year proseminars, and wrote so many 10-15 page papers in the computer lab.  I used to have tons of 3.5 floppies.

		<span id="comment-111120604-content"><p>At college in Wales before I went to university, the lift in our residential block was ancient, and seemed to spend nearly as much time being mended as actually working. So it was always asking for trouble to get into it. And I just happened to be the very last person to ever use it before it died completely. Time really does pass very very slowly when you&#39;re stuck inside a lift on your own. But at least the emergency button worked!</p></span>

		<span id="comment-111158828-content"><p>I must have learned the lessons of existentialism pretty well, because when I got stuck in an elevator the day I moved into college, I spent a few minutes ringing some bell, and then sat down, resigned to whatever would befall me. Forty-five minutes later it descended into the basement, and I walked out to zero fanfare. Then I found my parents, who were helping me move in. They hadn&#39;t missed me. I never mentioned what happened until right now.</p></span>

<p>If you carry with you a long, hollow iron alloy rod, some flexible rubber tubing and a small canister of oxygen, you could improvise a thermic lance and cut your way out through the elevator doors and the wall of the elevator shaft. You might then have to pay for the repairs, though.<br />
I would not recommend using field-expedient shaped charges to escape from a stuck elevator.</p></span>

The settlement's neither on behalf of nor against the Ottoman Empire. The culprit is the insurance company New York Life, but its legal and press teams thought it best to name the settlement after the Ottomans. New York Life merely refused to disburse life-insurance payments to the families of the 2,400 NYL policy-holders killed in the Armenian Genocide. Who would want to claim &quot;New York Life Insists It Need Not Honor Policies Purchased By The Victims Of Genocide Settlement Payments&quot; when they could appear imperial? Certainly not this California tax-payer.</span></a></div>

ANON: It's on your blog. They'll know it's you. SEK: Except I'm not on the market this year. I'm sure you'll reveal yourself unwittingly somehow and end up on the streets. ANON: Giving handjobs for crack? SEK: If you must. ANON: I must. So what do you think your readers want to know about failure? SEK: How to avoid it. ANON: Don't go to grad school. SEK: Granted. ANON: Because once you're in you're doomed. SEK: Granted. But I think people would be more interested in the particular failures they ought to avoid. ANON: Complete with revealing details? SEK: They will be curious. ANON: I would be too. But I'm not into gratification. SEK: We've been trained. I hear a bell and look for a lever. ANON: So should we riff behaviorist or tell the people what they want to know? SEK: The latter. ANON: We should start by having you ask me a probing question. SEK: If you had once piece of advice for people about to hit the market what would it be? ANON: Perspective. Never travel without spare perspective. For me it came from reading Junot Díaz's The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. Not the book, which I started when I was next to death with pneumonia, and put down immediately upon recovery to continue reading journals relevant to my field. It's the quotation that opens it: &quot;Of what import are brief, nameless lives ... to Galactus??&quot; SEK: So your advice to candidates is to take consolation in the fact that the entire planet isn't being devoured by The Eater of Worlds? ANON: The alternative requires an absurd calculus of merit and need that no human will be able to fathom short of the Singularity. SEK: I'm not sure how follow Galactus. ANON: You can't. That's why he's King of Perspective-Bringing.</span></a></div>
