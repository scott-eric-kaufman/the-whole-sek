        <meta name="description" content="This is a complement to the most recent podcast Steven Attewell and I produced, on “Second Sons,” in which we discussed, among many things—some of them kitten-related—miscommunication and the wedding of Sansa Stark and Tyrion Lannister. I found my contribution to that part of the discussion lacking, so I decided to demonstrate what I meant about Tyrion coming to dominate a scene that possesses real potential for chaos. But first let me make two noncontroversial statements: Prior to acquiring language, mammals developed the ability to use their eyeballs to control others’ eyeballs simply by looking around an environment. Filmmakers have long taken advantage of our inability not to follow the eyeballs of characters as they glance around the screen. So if you walk into a crowd and everyone’s looking up: I don’t care who you are or where you’re from, you’re going to follow their eyes and look up too: It’s just natural—even if you’re really not from around here. The same logic applies when you’re watching a film. If all the characters look at something, your eyes will follow theirs. It’s the quietest means a director has to move your eyeballs where he or she wants them. Noisier varieties include dramatic movement, the sudden appearance of a new object or character, a loud unexpected sound, etc. Clearly these attentive systems evolved hand-in-hand: the first person who notices the sudden appearance of a new object may make a dramatic movement, which catches the attention of everyone else and compels them to follow that first person’s glance. For example, if four people are in dining room and one of them notices a giant fucking lion in the kitchen, that person’s likely to make a dramatic movement accompanied by a loud unexpected sound; everyone else will turn to that person and then follow their glance into the kitchen, at which point they’ll also notice a giant fucking lion and panic will happen. At this point in our social evolution, however, we don’t need dramatic movements and loud unexpected sounds to compel our eyes to follow others’ glances—we just do it. When coupled with all the social strictures that regulate who can look at whom and in what way and when, the potential for a director to make an audience very uncomfortable should be obvious. They can make us look at things we shouldn’t be looking at, or at things we can be looking at but are doing so wrongly, or most powerfully, they can use the sympathy or enmity they’ve already established for particular characters to make us pity or praise them for the direction of their glances. The wedding of Sansa and Tyrion is a perfect example of exactly how this is done by someone quite talented at doing it, Michelle MacClaren, whose episode of Breaking Bad, “Gliding Over All,” was all about staring and following stares.

I found <a href="http://youtu.be/5KQ8ti9CHRU#t=42m48s">my contribution to that part of the discussion</a>

<li>Filmmakers have long taken advantage of our inability not to follow the eyeballs of characters as they glance around the screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>So if you walk into a crowd and everyone’s looking up:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00307.png"><img alt="" height="205" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00307-1024x422.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00307" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I don’t care who you are or where you’re from, you’re going to follow their eyes and look up too:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00319.png"><img alt="" height="206" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00319-1024x422.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00319" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It’s just natural—even if <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/09/richard-donner-knew-that-superman-needed-a-powerful-entrance-in-superman-1978-but-he-also-knew-that-the-one-element-that-i.html">you’re <em>really </em>not from around here</a>.
 The same logic applies when you’re watching a film. If all the 
characters look at something, your eyes will follow theirs. It’s the 
quietest means a director has to move your eyeballs where he or she 
wants them. Noisier varieties include dramatic movement, the sudden 
appearance of a new object or character, a loud unexpected sound, etc. 
Clearly these attentive systems evolved hand-in-hand: the first person 
who notices the sudden appearance of a new object may make a dramatic 
movement, which catches the attention of everyone else and compels them 
to follow that first person’s glance. </p>
<p>For example, if four people are in
 dining room and one of them notices <em>a giant fucking lion </em>in 
the kitchen, that person’s likely to make a dramatic movement 
accompanied by a loud unexpected sound; everyone else will turn to that 
person and then follow their glance into the kitchen, at which point 
they’ll also notice <em>a giant fucking lion</em> and panic will 
happen. At this point in our social evolution, however, we don’t need 
dramatic movements and loud unexpected sounds to compel our eyes to 
follow others’ glances—we just do it.</p>
<p>When coupled with all the social strictures that regulate who can 
look at whom and in what way and when, the potential for a director to 
make an audience very uncomfortable should be obvious. They can make us 
look at things we shouldn’t be looking at, or at things we can be 
looking at but are doing so wrongly, or most powerfully, they can use 
the sympathy or enmity they’ve already established for particular 
characters to make us pity or praise them for the direction of their 
glances. The wedding of Sansa and Tyrion is a perfect example of exactly 
how this is done by someone quite talented at doing it, Michelle 
MacClaren, whose episode of <em>Breaking Bad</em>, “Gliding Over All,” <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/breaking-bad-gliding-over-all-said-the-fly-to-the-money-pile">was all</a> about <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/breaking-bad-gliding-over-all-the-invisible-lines-and-immaterial-connections">staring</a> and <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/breaking-bad-gliding-over-all-until-youre-not">following stares</a>. (In fact that second link contains images <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/files/breaking-bad00076.png">strongly resembling</a>
 those about to follow, except this time, for ease of reference I’ll 
keep everyone’s eyelines a consistent color: Joffrey’s yellow, Tyrion’s 
teal, etc.) So let’s start staring!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00066.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00066.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00066" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Here we have Joffrey repaying Tyrion for the venomous look Tyrion 
shot him when he saw that the boy-king, who had murdered Sansa’s father,
 would be accompanying her down the aisle in her murdered father’s 
stead. Note that though Joffrey occupies the central element of the 
screen, his exaggerated posture as he bends to steal Tyrion’s 
wedding-stool mocks his uncle’s stature. He need not say a word—the 
insult is understood:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00070.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00070.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00070" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>MacClaren responds to the boy-king’s pettiness by closing in on Tyrion’s 
face. The audience sympathizes with the sadness in Tyrion’s eyes just as
 it had the hatred moments earlier. His eyes aren’t open and inviting—as say <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/frodo%20bigger%20eyes.jpg">this fellow’s are</a>—but we’re close enough to his face to register the pain upon it, which makes the following shot all the more judgmental:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00071.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00071.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00071" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The perspective on Cersei’s eyeline is a little off—she’s actually 
looking more up and towards the audience, which now stands approximately
 where Tyrion did—but Joffrey’s clearly looking not at his uncle but 
at Sansa, his former bride-to-be, as a means of furthering her 
humiliation. Neither mother nor son need speak a word for the audience 
to hate them for openly mocking an already tragic scene. We only need 
follow their eyes to condemn them. This dynamic continues right through 
to the wedding feast:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00076.png"><img alt="" height="281" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00076.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00076" width="501" /></a></p>
<p>The scene opens without an establishing shot. Instead, this medium 
shot is the only information the audience has about who&#39;s there and where 
they exist in space. Joffrey and Cersei are staring in the same general 
direction, and we want to know what they’re looking at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00077.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00077.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00077" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Apparently they’re looking at Tyrion, except that doesn’t seem right.
 They medium shot was level with them and they appeared to be looking 
down, whereas now we seem to have a close-up that’s angled slightly low,
 meaning we seem to be looking slightly up. This could be a reverse to 
an eyeline match—that it follows the shot of Joffrey and 
Cersei strongly suggests as much—but the attention Tyrion’s paying to 
pouring his glass suggests that if he’s the object of their eyeline 
match, he’s an unwitting one. Given how “drunk” he’ll become, that’s a 
possibility, but my real point here is that the first two shots of the 
wedding banquet are merely contiguous, nothing more. They follow each 
other, but they don’t do so in a conventional manner, meaning that two 
shots into this banquet the audience is already a little lost about 
who’s where. Perhaps the next shot will provide a clue?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00078.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00078.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00078" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It will not. The bride’s not watching her new husband attentively 
pour himself more wine, she’s looking off-screen at something, but we’re
 not privy to what. But at the very least MacClaren makes a compelling 
point with the direction of their respective glances: the attentions of the newly 
betrothed are literally pointed in opposite directions, his to the left,
 hers to the right. Maybe we’ll get to see what she’s looking at?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00088.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00088.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00088" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This is at least a possibility: even though the camera’s level on 
Olenna Tyrell, it’s possible that Sansa’s looking down on her and that 
this is an eyeline match; but even if she is, what’s significant that 
Olenna’s not looking up and returning Sansa’s eyeline. There’s no 
connection between them—no eye contact—which only doubles the 
audience’s impression of Sansa’s isolation: she was just looking in the 
opposite direction of her husband, but now she’s watching someone have a
 conversation with someone else. Who Olenna’s having that conversation 
with isn’t clear because, again, MacClaren’s still hasn’t provided us 
with an establishing shot. All we can tell is that it’s <em>not </em>Sansa.</p>
<p>At this point in the scene we have no way to orient ourselves in it: 
we can’t tell who’s looking at what or talking to whom, and as social 
animals who try to locate ourselves in social spaces, we find this 
extremely unsettling. It’s the equivalent of being a child lost among a 
sea of legs in a room we don’t recognize: we can tell that people are 
looking at things but not what; we can tell that people are related to 
each other but not how; and we can only acquire information one face at a
 time because we’re too fucking short to see above the crowd. This can’t go 
on forever. At some point MacClaren must relent:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00089.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00089.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00089" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>And she does, but only somewhat, because we still don’t know which 
one of these three Sansa was looking at. We thought we did because of 
the logic of the initial reverse to Olenna, but now we see that she 
could’ve been looking at <em>any </em>of these three people who aren’t 
returning her glance. So Sansa’s still doubly lonely, but at least we 
know that Olenna’s talking to Margaery Tyrell. However, just because we 
have some information about the relative location of people in the room 
doesn’t mean people are going to start communicating with each other: 
Olenna and Margaery’s conversation excludes Loras Tyrell, who sits 
between them and glares at something off the left side of the screen. 
What? Maybe we’ll finally have a conventional reverse?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons0089a.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons0089a.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons0089a" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Didn’t think so. Now we’ve got a long shot of the Lannister table 
from over Sansa’s shoulder, which may not be a conventional reverse, but
 at least helps situate us in space. We assumed that Olenna and Margaery
 and Loras were to Sansa’s left because the earlier shot of Olenna 
could’ve been an unrequited eyeline match; if we pair that assumption 
with the fact that Joffrey and Cersei are to her right, we can infer 1) 
that Cersei’s staring down someone at the Tyrell table, possibly Loras, 
who was looking in her direction in the previous shot; and 2) that 
Joffrey and Cersei weren’t staring at Tyrion in that opening shot, but 
at the Tyrell table. Specifically—albeit for different reasons—they 
were both <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00076.png" target="_self">staring at the left side of the Tyrell table</a>, meaning that in 
all likelihood this scene opened with mother and son staring at their 
wife-and-sister-among-many-other-things-to-be, Margaery. But in the 
above, at least someone’s finally making eye contact with Sansa—except
 that it’s Joffrey and he’s making shit-eating eyes at her. MacClaren 
cuts to the groom’s shoulder’s perspective:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00215.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00215.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00215" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Which informs us that the one example of eye contact previous to 
Joffrey and Sansa’s has been broken, as Olenna’s now staring at the 
Lannister table, presumably in response to Cersei shooting red lasers at
 Margaery in the previous shot. Margaery seems unaware of—or is 
ignoring—Cersei’s glare, but she has to recognize that Olenna’s broken
 eye contact with her. Loras, still utterly uninvolved, stares at the 
table. Tyrion, however, is watching Olenna stare at his sister with what
 seems—because no one’s looking at him—like an almost 
anthropological curiosity. He’s watching everyone watch everyone else 
without making eye contact with anyone. It’s almost like <em>he’s gauging the room in preparation for some sort of performance</em>.&#0160;<em> </em>After Olenna turns back to Margaery, perhaps embarrassed by having been caught staring so intently, Cersei turns to Joffrey:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00218.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00218.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00218" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Who’s clearly still trying to eye-fuck Sansa. Before seeing her 
response, it’s important to note that even though she’s his mother and 
has made him the “man” he is today, she’s being unduly deferential and 
speaking to him without even attempting to establish eye contact. As for
 Sansa:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00219.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00219.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00219" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>She has found something very interesting on the floor. She’s looking 
neither at the Tyrell nor the Lannister table now, while her new husband
 stares, in an exaggerated fashion, into a pitcher of wine. It’s almost 
as if he wants people to think that he doesn’t know how it works anymore—that he’s so far in his cups he hasn’t a fucking a clue how to put 
more wine in them. Although it’s doubtful she knows what Tyrion’s 
planning, Sansa clearly wants no part of the dynamic she’s witnessing 
develop. And with good reason:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00220.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00220.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00220" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Now both of them are staring at her. Which provides Margaery an opportunity to stare at them:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00221.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00221.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00221" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Note that there’s no cross-talk going on between tables. The only way
 the Tyrells and Lannisters are communicating are through these glances.
 But before Margaery can figure out what they’re talking about—and 
most likely for her own good—Olenna draws her back into conversation:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00223.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00223.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00223" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Which seems to annoy Loras enough that he decides to leave, but 
instead of him leaving in this shot, MacClaren returns to the long shot 
from over Tyrion’s shoulder:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00223a.png"><img alt="" height="279" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00223a.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00223a" width="498" /></a></p>
<p>Tyrion seems to believe that Loras’s departure indicates that rules 
are about to change. Whatever sense of decorum had held these parties in
 check has been violated. That it’s Loras tiring of being spoken past by
 Margaery and Olenna is immaterial. The dynamic in the room is shifting 
and Tyrion needs to take control of it. He does so the best way he knows
 how:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00228.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00228.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00228" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>By appearing to be <em>very </em>drunk.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00229.png"><img alt="" height="279" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00229.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00229" width="498" /></a></p>
<p>So very drunk Sansa has no choice but to resume her study of the 
floor, only this time more enthusiastically. But Tyrion’s performance 
may have been a little too loud and dramatic, because it’s caught his 
father’s attention:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00230.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00230.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00230" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Tywin sees Tyrion staring “drunkenly” at his reflection and realizes 
that Tyrion’s realized something. Tywin isn’t sure exactly what—it’s 
not like they’ve been talking to each other with words or anything—but
 he realizes that his clever son has seen an opportunity of some sort 
and, alerted to the potential threat, will likely do something about it.
 He knows better than anyone that Tyrion can become <em>a giant fucking lion</em>
 when it suits his needs, and Tywin is determined that nothing of the 
sort will happen tonight. Because although it’s Tyrion’s wedding night, 
it’s the culmination of Twyin’s plans, and he’s not about to let his 
clever son disrupt them. Since he knows Tyrion’s a rational person, 
Twyin decides to convince him of the wrongness of whatever it is he’s 
about to do, but he never gets the chance:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00240.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00240.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00240" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Because as he started walking toward his rational son, his irrational
 grandson set his sights on Sansa, who has now found a fascinating 
object of study on the ceiling. Margaery notices Joffrey’s movements:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00244.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00244.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00244" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>But she stared too long. Joffrey notices her noticing him:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00245.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00245.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00245" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>And clearly decides that whatever indignity he was about to subject Sansa to must now include Margaery as well:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00248.png"><img alt="" height="281" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00248.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00248" width="501" /></a></p>
<p>Nice try, Margaery, but he already caught you. You’re now an integral part of whatever plan he’s explaining to his mother:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00249.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00249.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00249" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Because he’s talking to her—but he’s looking at you. Even she knows this isn’t going to end well:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00251.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00251.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00251" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>So what began as a drunken wedding party in which we, the audience, 
couldn’t orient ourselves either in space or with relation to the 
attendants is now about to turn ugly. Imagine that? A drunken wedding 
party turning ugly! Except given the involvement of Joffrey—a boy-king
 so monstrous even his mother seems afraid to make eye contact with him—the ugliness that could ensue could be beheading-Eddard-Stark awful. 
The only hope seems to be that Tywin can convince Tyrion to put aside 
whatever play he’s developing and put a stop to Joffrey’s … and about 
that I’ll have more to say tomorrow.</p>

But it's been found! Also, in this podcast we have a first: I've finally figured out how to incorporate images without making the resulting file too large for Youtube. So now if you're watching the podcast, you'll see the visuals we're describing while we're describing them. (At least mostly. I'm still experimenting with keeping the size down and the audio quality high. This is tougher than it looks.) In this episode we discuss making my students weep uncontrollably; the dynamics of the relationship between Tyrion and Sansa; the similarities between Dany and Walter White; the politics of Stannis Baratheon; and many other things beside. Enjoy! Enjoy this fine podcast without the images I painstakingly inserted into it just for you. Our very civilized discussion of the premiere (S03E01). Fancy-talking about “Dark Wings, Dark Words” (S03E02). Here we are blathering on about “Walk of Punishment” (S03E03). Don’t watch — because you can’t — us discuss “And Now His Watch Has Ended” (S03E04). The rudely interrupted first half of our discussion of “Kissed by Fire” (S03E05). The second half of our discussion of religion in “Kissed by Fire” (S03E05). In which we discuss “The Climb” sans spoilers (S03E06). &quot;The Climb&quot; with spoilers (S03E06).</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2013/05/i-still-know-that-youve-seen-that-i-saw-you-miscommunication-in-second-sons-game-of-thrones.html"><span><strong>I still know that you've seen that I saw you: miscommunication in &quot;Second Sons&quot; (Game of Thrones)</strong> To recap: this is a complement to the most recent podcast Steven Attewell and I produced, on “Second Sons,” in which we discussed, among many things, miscommunication at the wedding of Sansa Stark and Tyrion Lannister. I found my contribution to that part of the discussion lacking, so I decided to demonstrate what I meant about Tyrion coming to dominate a scene that possesses real potential for chaos. The first part can be found here and really needs to be read for the following to make sense. When we left off, what had been a hostile but orderly wedding banquet teetered on the edge of something. Relations had been frosty but fine until Loras Tyrell reminded people how legs work and walked away from the table, which inspired Tyrion to do something with alcohol. His father, Tywin, noticed his clever son noticing Loras and, aware that Tyrion can become a giant fucking lion when the mood strikes, strode across the hall to talk to him. However, his grandson (twice-over) had a terrible idea: Joffrey “Baratheon” decided to humiliate his former bride-to-be, Sansa, but caught Margaery Tyrell noticing his planning-face and decided she should be part of it too. All of this happened via glances passing between parties. We resume mere seconds after the last post ended, with Tyrion staring at Sansa’s ass: This is only unusual not only because, in recent episodes, Tyrion’s been shot in a manner that makes his head appear level to those of the people he’s speaking to. From the camera’s perspective, when he spoke to his father, sister or nephew, he’d ceased being a little person. But earlier in this episode, his height — and its relation to his sexual abilities — had been made an issue when he met with Sansa: Such is what’s required of him not to stare at her ass. The contrast between this shot before the wedding and the one of his father — that’s Twyin behind him in the first image — is part of both Michelle MacClaren, the director, and Tyrion’s respective plans. In order to make himself appear drunker than he actually is, Tyrion abandons the pretense of being the willful supplicant and lets his eyes rest at their natural level. That it happens to coincide with Sansa’s ass is a happy and convenient coincidence that fails to impress his father: Note that since she’s merely moving the camera up and to the let about a foot, MacClaren could’ve used a conventional two-shot; but because conventional two-shots create the impression of a bond between characters, she shot them individually. This has two effects: it reinforces the notion that these two are only strategically “intimate,” and it allows Tyrion to dominate the screen when he’s on it. That may not seem significant, but it’s important that the audience, at this moment, see Tyrion as someone capable of dominating the screen: Is his father behind him? Yes, in the literal sense; but only maybe in the colloquial, because Tywin...</span></a></div>
