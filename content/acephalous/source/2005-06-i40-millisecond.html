<p>Aaaaaaaaaand Scene!</p>

<p>The point of this exercise?&nbsp; An imitation of the alliterative mania of William Gass,* but also an <a href="http://www.ffbooks.co.uk/n26/n131178.htm">Abishian</a> attempt to write something not entirely nonsensical under artificial restraints.&nbsp; And damn did it not work.&nbsp; All this time invested compels me to press publish anyway, and so I will--but not before noting that there's a real correspondence between words which, in English, begin with &quot;sn-&quot; and what they signify.&nbsp; I've often found arguments about why certain sounds connote similarly but none of them have ever been all that convincing.&nbsp; I don't buy the brazen explanations gracing the pages of my linguistics books, but I've done little work on recent research, so maybe there's something new.&nbsp; To the library!</p>

<p>*Sample Gassian prose: &quot;Poker for peanuts or pennies is not the same game as one with limitless stakes, and there are certain driving skills which come into play only at high speeds; so that even if there's a resemblance between walking a fallen log and crossing a piece of structural steel amidst the worries of work, wind, and altitude, the achievements are in no way the same, although, again, exhortations like 'careful to keep your balance' are in both cases appropriate and certainly appreciated.&quot;&nbsp; Gass always teeters between the grossly over-written and pitch perfection.&nbsp; I always wonder how often the first consonant sound of one word determines which will follow--and what effect that has on the meaning of his essays--as when, for example, he says of people who feel the need for therapeutic &quot;creativity,&quot; who want &quot;to pass as poets, to be called 'creative,' to fit themselves into a certain social niche, acquire an identity the way one acquires plants there's no time to tend or goldfish that can't be kept alive...&quot;&nbsp; In that sentence alone, much less the rest of his corpus, we have &quot;pass as poets,&quot; &quot;called 'creative,'&quot; &quot;certain social niche,&quot; &quot;way one,&quot; &quot;time to tend&quot; and &quot;can't be kept.&quot;&nbsp; And almost every sentence he writes is written thus.&nbsp; I admire the playfulness of his prose--as above the fold discloses, I love little more than language play--and enjoy emulating it immensely.&nbsp; But I wonder whether what he's written writes itself to some extent, or whether what he's written first is thought and then is wrought.&nbsp; I don't know, but you no doubt know why Gass in short doses does please much more than Gass in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1564782131/qid=1118452030/sr=8-2/ref=pd_csp_2/102-9607103-5071311?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">manly morsels</a>.</p>

To them I hurl hurtful words about how rewarding teaching literary journalism is and how refreshing reading drafts of student articles meant not to impress but entertain is. (The grading grammar hangover, as the syntax of that previous sentence makes abundantly clear, still bedevils literary journalism instructors.) After a quarter spent teaching the middle- to high-brow techniques commonly employed by literary journalists, I'm faced with a situation in which commenting on student papers involves little more than line-editing, pointing to the techniques the students should've already gleaned from articles already read and the occasional finger-wagging when a student's &quot;research&quot; underwhelms. (Before accusations of academic sinecure start flying around, carefully consider the phrase &quot;little more than line-editing.&quot;) This quarter I pushed back the first draft of the required writing component of the course to Week 9, the quarter's penultimate week, with the thought that the more time the students concentrate on reading, the better the final articles will be. Boy. Howdy. These first drafts floored me. While still suffering from many of the problems that all young literary journalists must overcome, these first drafts are far suprior to any first drafts past students have produced. Not only that, some of these first drafts are better than many of the final drafts past students have produced. In the past, I've had first drafts due in Week 7, the thought being that the more revisions the better. But there's a trade-off: because the students already writing in Weeks 5, 6 and 7, they're not paying as much attention to the assigned reading as they otherwise might. (I suspect that, up-swept in the rush to produce their first drafts, they may do very little of the assigned reading.) This quarter, they focused on reading, analyzing and discussing articles until Week 8 and what I've discovered is this: those 4 or 5 extra weeks of dedicated reading make all the difference in the world. These students are impressively intuitive because, technically speaking, they fucking get it. Why then do you suppose that so many undergraduate papers for literature classes are so patently awful? The commonplace complaint of English professors--the students don't read criticism and therefore don't know how to produce it--always rings hollow. The Balkanization of the profession ensures that even a student well-versed in criticism is unlikely to produce what a particular professor considers a competent critical analysis. What these students need is some way to read hundreds of superior student essays, to mine them not for ideas--that's plagiarism, and plagiarism, as we all know, is the devil's third favorite past-time after putting idle hands to use and masturbation--but for proficiency. English undergraduates write terrible papers because they don't fucking get it. They can't because they're never exposed to what good undergraduate English essays look like; or they know what an abstract model of a good undergraduate English...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/a_gassian_discl.html"><span><strong>A Gassian Disclaimer, or An Apology for Yesterday's, um, OED-Inspired Madness</strong> Last week I asked you to name whose prose enlivens yours. Now I'd like to know whose deadens it. As yesterday's Gassian fiasco suggests, no writer has a more deleterious effect on my prose than Gass. My brain wraps itself around his prose and is unable to unwend itself for days, nay, weeks afterward. It's fairly funny to me how horrible I write after reading Gass, especially since I so enjoy reading him. Who doesn't love prose of powerfully alliterative and argumentative density? I know I don't not. [That said, writing with OED-inspired momentum, as I did yesterday, is a thrilling exercise, one I recommend to everyone. I don't, however, recommend publishing the results of said exercises publically unless you're willing to 1) plug your ears to the torrents of abuse from readers who demand some sense in their nonsense, 2) be thought an addict of some new ADHD medication, 3) supply others with scripts for your new ADHD medication on pain of pain (which is pain enough for me), or 4) lose your regular readers to less violently idiotic sites like FrontPage Magazine.]</span></a></div>
