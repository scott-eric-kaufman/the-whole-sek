			<p>All I had to do was dither around the site to which I&#39;d already linked to find evidence that <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/people-who-only-talk-to-themselves-either-already-are-or-drive-themselves-crazy">my prediction about the next two months is correct</a>. Because as it turns out <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2012/09/20/Reward-100000-for-Khalidi-Tape">I somehow missed this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Breitbart News is doubling its reward—to $100,000—for one
 of the missing pieces of Barack Obama’s past, which may be the key to 
understanding his collapsing Middle East policy: the “Khalidi tape,” a 
video kept under wraps by the Los Angeles Times since April 2008.</p>
<p>The Khalidi tape shows Obama at a 2003 farewell party for radical 
Palestinian academic and activist Rashid Khalidi, and reportedly

<p>The ties between Obama and Khalidi are deep, going back to the days 
when Obama served on the board of the Woods Fund with former terrorist 
Bill Ayers, and provided funds for Khalidi’s Arab American Action 
Network ...</p>
<p>Given Obama’s muted response to the attacks on U.S. embassies and 
troops throughout the Middle East today; his refusal to meet with 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week; his eagerness to 
sacrifice Americans’ free speech rights in fruitless gestures of 
appeasement; and his belated but effusive support for the 
now-radicalized Arab Spring, it is worth examining the roots of his 
misguided foreign policy.</p>
<p>The Khalidi tape may provide the key.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m pleased to introduce you to The <em>New</em> New Stupid, son of <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/08/the-new-stupid-passes-it-on.html">The New Stupid</a>,
 inevitable father to the host of Newer Stupids due to arrive in the 
next two months. When FOX decided to blanket itself in that <a href="http://youtu.be/JYt4hXjrEjk">1998 video of Obama</a>
 discussing taxation as an anodyne form of redistributing wealth, all I 
could think was that someone in management thought tit-for-tat the most 
effective strategy to counter the release of the Romney video.* If they 
have videos, I imagined management saying, we will too. Put aside the 
fact that FOX claims to be an independent news organization and focus on
 the fact that executives at FOX believe that &quot;video&quot; is a unit, and 
that the only way to counter one unit of &quot;video&quot; is with another.</p>
<p>Breitbart News, so named because it decided to call itself that, 
literally doubled-down today in an attempt to produce a unit of &quot;video&quot; 
that will damage Obama&#39;s candidacy more than Romney&#39;s did his. This 
video, if it exists, will do maximal damage because it&#39;ll introduce 
Breitbart News readers and FOX viewers to shocking new ideas like &quot;Obama
 has Muslim sympathies,&quot; &quot;Obama hates Israel&quot; and &quot;Obama pals around 
with terrorists.&quot; As I noted in my previous post, the problem with this 
approach is that anyone who&#39;s going to believe that already does, so 
finding a unit of &quot;video&quot; that can be edited to demonstrate Obama&#39;s 
long-standing loathing of America and gefilte fish <em>will have absolutely no impact on the election</em>.</p>
<p>Yet it&#39;s incredibly important to conservative &quot;news&quot; outlets to find 
and disseminate as many of these units as they can between now and 
November. I would say that I don&#39;t know why, but I know that sucking at 
the conservative teat requires <em>bona fides</em> and that all these 
folks need them lest they be forced to leave the house and find a job 
that doesn&#39;t consist of shaming people who already have one.</p>
<p>*I also thought that &quot;blanket coverage&quot; made for an apt metaphor: FOX
 management ducked under the covers because thunder had thundered or 
monsters had crept from beneath the bed or Romney had opened his mouth.</p>

As strategies go, it had its charms: conservatives would only talk and watch and read other conservatives, thereby eliminating the possibility that they might hear or see or read anything that failed to conform to their prejudices. For months, this strategy seemed to be working. They had convinced themselves and each other that Obama, being the worst president in the history of the United States, couldn't be elected again if the opposition candidate had some appeal to the center. So they chose Mitt Romney. Unfortunately, Mitt Romney also chose them. He started to appeal to the conservative base in order to acquire what had already been delivered. He was supposed to bring in the centrists, but he and his campaign chose tactics designed to further secure the base. The irony is that his appeals to the base have only angered and alienated it. His &quot;inelegant&quot; iterations of their cherished theories have set the terms of the national debate against conservatives, such that any argument about equitable taxation must begin by discussing the 47 percent instead of job creation. In the war to frame the debate, conservatives now believe, Mitt Romney has unwittingly played the role of Benedict Arnold. With the former opportunist Romney now considered an extremist, what are the actual extremists to do? If the past week is any indication, they are going to spend the next two months losing their shit to establish their bona fides. Now that they have no reason to appeal to center, or to rational thought generally, we are in for two months of: Barack Obama has been building a cult of personality reminiscent of fascist leaders. That doesn’t mean he’s a fascist; it doesn’t mean that he’s Hitler or Mussolini or Stalin. But his semiotics and iconography are far more suited for a fascist country than a vibrant republic. Of course Ben Shapiro has no clue what &quot;semiotics&quot; actually means, but it makes him sound like an authority on something, in this case the &quot;fascist&quot; field of branding. Instead of being annoyed that, from Shepard Fairey forward, the Obama campaign team has simply demonstrated a more sophisticated understanding of contemporary advertising than any of its Republican opponents, Shapiro wants to claim that the use of &quot;iconography&quot; is &quot;far more suited for a fascist country than a vibrant republic.&quot; And it doesn't matter how many images of the Twin Towers falling or acting Presidents in flight suits you show him, Shapiro will never believe that any other administration has ever used the power of singular images to sway public opinion. It's only ever been Obama. This is but the tip of the iceberg. The knotted fringes of the far right movement no longer have any reason to remain tangled, so as their weak coalitions unravel expect to hear more about every inane and insane...</span></a></div>

SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: I want you to know I’m blocking you, asshole. Every time you write about how much you love Romney you prove you hate America and the troops. I just wanted to be the man who manned up and said FUCK YOU to your face. SEK: I think you meant “Obama.” SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: FUCK YOU! SEK: You already said that. SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: FUCK OFF! SEK: Didn’t you block me? SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: ASSHOLE! SEK: Would you like me to tell you how to block me? After reading the comments that appeared after I posted the above as a status update, SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL wrote me back. SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: You’re laughing at me! SEK: I am. SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: I can read it! SEK: You can. My feed’s public. SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: But we’re not friends anymore! SEK: My feed’s public. SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: Fuck your feed! Make it stop! SEK: So far as anyone knows, I’m mocking a generic conservative bigot. As long as you don’t comment on it no one will know I’m mocking you. SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: (comments on the previous post while I write the above, then demands) DELETE MY COMMENT NOW ASSHOLE! SEK: You wrote it. Delete it yourself. SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: I did. (he didn’t) SEK: (so I did) Good for you. SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: Now delete what you wrote. SEK: No. SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: DO IT NOW! SEK: No. SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: MAKE IT SO I CAN’T SEE IT! SEK: My feed’s public. SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: I DON’T WANT TO SEE IT! SEK: Then don’t look at it. SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: THEY’RE MAKING FUN OF ME! SEK: They are. SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: FUCKING DEMOCRATS! SEK: If you insist. SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: I DO! SEK: Good for you. SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: YOU DON’T KNOW ME! I FUCKING HATE YOU! SEK: You realize I’m going to post this too, don’t you? SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: YOU BETTER NOT! SEK: Why? SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: WE’RE NOT EVEN FRIENDS ANYMORE! SEK: Then what reason do I have not to post it? SOMEONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL: ASSHOLE! DON’T DO IT! SEK: OBAMA COMMANDED ME. I HAVE NO CHOICE.
