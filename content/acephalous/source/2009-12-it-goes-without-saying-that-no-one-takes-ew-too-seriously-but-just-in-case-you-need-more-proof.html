I think your problem here is that of many film critics: you assume that the best work must necessarily be an R-rated drama.  Obviously, there&#39;s a lot in the way of pathos and serious social issues, etc., that you can&#39;t get at except in a realistic drama, but no one can responsibly say that&#39;s all the medium is capable of.  I mean, Arrested Development and The Office (and props to EW for using the British, not the American Office‚Äîthat makes *me* take them seriously) are not only two of the best sitcoms we&#39;ve had, but also helped to reinvent the genre.  (Wouldn&#39;t you put Seinfeld pretty high on a list of the best TV shows of the 90&#39;s?)  And the Daily Show surely deserves its high ranking: has any other comedy talk show ever achieved TDS&#39;s degree of consistency and political relevance?  You can&#39;t even call it &quot;influential,&quot; since no other show has even attempted what they do (except Colbert, which is a spinoff).  I personally would have put The Wire higher than they have it (for one thing, Lost wouldn&#39;t make my top 10 at all), but I think that having a balanced view of what constitutes a &quot;great TV show&quot; is actually a sign of seriousness rather than the opposite.</p>

<p>(On the other hand, the utter absence of Battlestar baffles me.  I mean, I never even heard of the show they have at #10; surely they could have slipped BSG in there?)</p></span>

<p>I do not!  <em>Buffy</em> would&#39;ve made my top ten had it been of this decade, and <em>Arrested Development</em> is up in my top five.  Not only would <em>Seinfeld</em> rank highly on my hypothetical &#39;90s list, I&#39;m a little miffed that <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> is absent from basically everywhere.  It&#39;s going to go down in the annals of television like a mid-period P.J. Harvey record: unloved in its day, but every genius who comes after&#39;s going to be indebted to it.</p>

<p>That said, I don&#39;t think <em>The Daily Show</em> belongs on any such list.  For one, Stewart took over in &#39;99, so it&#39;s not even of this decade; for another, like <em>Idol</em>, it&#39;s not innovative so much as it is important (although obviously for different reasons).  The exclusion of <em>BSG</em> is, I think, easily explained as blow-back against the finale.  Had <em>Caprica</em> been released in November as originally planned, I think <em>BSG</em> would&#39;ve been forgiven somewhat and made some lists.</p></span>

<p>And especially after 9/11.  Scott, I withdraw my libel about your undervaluing comedy programming, but I don&#39;t understand your comments about the Daily Show.  Past a certain point we can agree to disagree, but what do you mean it&#39;s not innovative?  Certainly there are standard talk show elements in it, but it pioneered techniques that not only had never been done before, but which also became a standard trope of modern, and especially online, rhetoric (the long chain of very short video clips in which everyone is saying the same thing, for instance), and Stewart&#39;s interview techniques certainly go beyond the standard talk show.  For another thing, how could it be important if it were *not* innovative?  And finally, this is after all not a list of the most *original* shows, but the *best,* which I think TDS has consistently been.  But that point is moot, as it&#39;s also an extremely innovative show, so there.</p>

<p>American Idol, now there&#39;s a show where I think you can separate innovation (leaving aside the fact that it was a British show first, okay) from quality.  The most I can say is that the people who enjoy it really enjoy it, but it&#39;s not my cup of tea.  But I probably wouldn&#39;t leave it off of my Top 10, if I were going beyond the narrow point of my own preferences.</p></span>

Of course, &quot;Best of Decade&quot; lists are pretty ridiculous, and shouldn&#39;t start until next year anyway, so the whole thing is just for fun.</p></span>

<p>Fair enough, but my main complaint, to address tomemos&#39;s point as well, is that it&#39;s fairly typical satire that just happens to be really, really good.  They&#39;re not breaking new ground like, say, <em>Arrested Development</em>, they&#39;re simply schooling other satirists in the niceties of satire.  Again, it&#39;s brilliant, but not ground-breaking; <em>Idol</em>, on the other hand, is neither, but right now it&#39;s propping up the entire recording industry, so its importance is sort of self-evident.  </p>

<p>Also, I should add that I fully intend on watching <em>Mad Men</em> one of these days, but not until I finish writing this book with a former ad executive whose husband&#39;s currently an ad executive, as there&#39;s just something weird about that whole scenario.</p></span>

<p>My top 5 would be dominated by HBO and FX dramas, but not because they&#39;re R-rated. Rather, the networks that allow their writers to explore R-rated territory also allow their writers to take their viewers seriously and not treat them like idiots. Even when the networks venture into serious dramas, like the ill-fated <i>Kings</i>, the writers are constantly slowing down the dialogue to make sure the viewers are following the plot. It&#39;s quite irritating.</p>

<p>Also in my Top 5 or 6 would be the original British <i>Life on Mars</i>. I agree that the <i>Daily Show</i> deserves its ranking; I might even put it higher.</p></span>

<p>Well, I don&#39;t want to belabor the point, but I don&#39;t see the distinction here at all.  I think the Daily Show has broken at least as much new ground as Arrested Development; if you disagree, I guess I&#39;d want to know what TV show attempted that kind of satire, on that scale and with those methods, before TDS.  Certainly Stewart and co. are continuing a satirical tradition‚Äîno show is <em>sui generis</em>, and that includes The Wire‚Äîbut I can&#39;t think of a political comedy show that actually attempted to outdo mainstream news, and was so successful at it.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0128765a5621970c-content"><p>I think another problem with the list is the assumption on EW&#39;s part that &quot;television&quot; is a genre it and of itself.  It&#39;s sort of like saying we should rate the best &quot;writing&quot; of the last year.  A cookbook, no matter how well-written, is simply not the same thing as a Thomas Pynchon novel.  We would probably laugh at that list a placed a cookbook above <i>Inherent Vice</i>, but such a list would be being disingenuous to cookbooks, too.</p>

<p><i>The Daily Show</i> (and, moreso, <i>American Idol</i>) is simply a different sort of program than a long-form scripted drama like <i>The Wire</i>.  That&#39;s partly why this list is weird.  It&#39;s a list of &quot;important things to be aired on a TV screen in the 00s,&quot; not the &quot;best TV shows of the 00s.&quot;  When we call <i>The Daily Show</i> a TV show do we mean the same thing when we call <i>The Wire</i> a TV show?</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ll add my vote for <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>.  The finale is not as bad as most people seem to think it is.  It suffered from high-expectations, which I think happens a lot in finales for &quot;mythology-heavy&quot; shows.  There&#39;s a lot of build-up and speculation leading up to the finale which makes the it inevitably disappointing.  This is probably going to be the case for <i>Lost</i> as well.  A little perspective and distance, plus the ability to view the final season as a larger narrative chunk on DVD (as opposed to smaller episodes separated by a week of speculation) will, I think, improve the reputation of BSG&#39;s finale.</p></span>
