Only in an environment in which debate has been denuded of its intellectual content and reduced to a series of ideologically loaded gesticulations could such a rhetorical gesture flourish.

			<p>Over on <a href="http://www.theoria.ca/theoria/2006/01/zizek.html">theoria</a> I find myself embroiled in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00005U8EM"><em>Groundhog Day</em></a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" /> of academic debates: </p>

<p>Someone writes something insulting.&nbsp; Someone else is insulted by it.&nbsp; The initial <a href="http://www.cinestatic.com/different_maps/index.asp">insul<em>ter</em></a> accuses the <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/">insul<em>tee</em></a> of being <a href="http://www.theoria.ca/theoria/2006/01/zizek.html#comment-12701660">insul<em>ting</em></a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>At this point (and the matter stands at this point) the insulted party faces a decision.&nbsp; Should he ignore the original slight?&nbsp; Should he attempt to communicate why he believes the insulter unaware of the insulting content of his initial insulting comment?&nbsp; </p>

<p>If he opts for the latter should he focus on the instance in which the insulter roundaboutly suggested other scholars tend &quot;venal and pathetic&quot; and favor &quot;the gestures of a cop&quot;?&nbsp; Should he attack the implied argument that scholars whose methods differ from those of the insulter are unthinking and unfeeling?&nbsp; </p>

<p>How should he communicate to the insulter that whatever invective wound its way into <a href="http://www.theoria.ca/theoria/2006/01/zizek.html#comment-12656027">that vigorous response</a> was justified by the insults which peppered his?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Intellectual honesty demands that I attack something.&nbsp; I'm inclined to attack the discourse speaking through the insulter instead of the insulter himself.&nbsp; Because I do believe it a matter of the rhetorical niceties of certain theoretical discourses.&nbsp; Some budding scholars are taught to consider what they do as &quot;thinking the new.&quot;&nbsp; When they engage other scholars they are bound to relegate the work of these other scholars to categories like &quot;the old.&quot;&nbsp; Or &quot;partisan defender[s] of the faith for the existing state of things.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Why?&nbsp; Because they are unable to see beyond the deadlocks of their own devising.&nbsp; To base the category of &quot;the new&quot; on further elaborations of Lacanian libinidal economies is to condemn, categorically, all work which fails to conform to one's assumptions as complicit in the ideology of the old.&nbsp; <em>No No No No No</em>.&nbsp; Or to quote <a href="http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/">Adam</a> quoting <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/my_mla_tales_from_the_crytonormative/#6307">Karl Barth</a>: <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/my_mla_tales_from_the_crytonormative/#6297">NEIN</a>!</p>

<p>The failure of imagination which produces that <em>rhetorical </em>affiliation of <em>philosophical </em>positions should be stricken from the record.&nbsp; For me to deny the explanatory power of a Lacanian libidinal economy <em>is not to declare undying devotion to the status quo</em>.&nbsp; I hazard these three hypotheses:</p>

<ol><li>Only in an environment devoid of honest intellectual interaction could such a rhetorical gesture flourish. </li>

<li>Only in an environment in which sub-sub-sub-disciplines thrive in intellectual isolation from each other could such a rhetorical gesture flourish. </li>

<li>Only in an environment in which debate has been denuded of its intellectual content and reduced to a series of ideologically loaded gesticulations could such a rhetorical gesture flourish.</li></ol>

<p>So I think this post means I'm finished with that thread.&nbsp; It has taken an interesting turn with Craig's discussion of how &quot;the real world&quot; works as rhetorical thunder.&nbsp; It has taken an interesting turn with Craig's <a href="http://www.theoria.ca/theoria/2006/01/zizek.html#comment-12721159">discussion</a> of the cudgel-cracking done under the auspices of &quot;the real world&quot; . . . but who am I kidding?&nbsp; I have <a href="http://www.theoria.ca/">theoria</a> open in another window and am waxing my bludgeon with one hand while typing with the other.</p>

<p>No I don't.&nbsp; <em>Yes I do.&nbsp; </em>No I don't.&nbsp; <em>Yes I do.</em>&nbsp; No I don't.&nbsp; <em>Yes I do.</em></p>

Although I agree with you that Lacanian catagories in the wrong hands function analogously to Marxian economics, I am compelled to point out that <i>what I take</i> from Lacan is the desire or <i>jouissance</i> which underlies my consciousness -admittedly a poor approximation of what the man said - But at least (I hope) it keeps me from investing myself so far into these fairly unimportant debates.  Irony, I say, Irony!  or Guilt:  we need one of the two, or both... An Ethic of Irony and Guilt.  That should fix it.  (At the least, I try and remember a line from Derrida:  &quot;In everything I say, there is jealousy.&quot;  I wonder if we could separate the existential from the verdictive, if discourse might be more civil?)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-12745527-content"><p>Craig, I wasn&#39;t kidding when I said that your discussion of my rhetorical devices intelligent and interesting.  I don&#39;t think I employed it in that fashion...at the very least, I didn&#39;t intend to, and if I seemed to, that&#39;s my own damn fault.  What bothered me about that response is that I specifically compared &quot;<a href="http://www.theoria.ca/theoria/2006/01/zizek.html#comment-12656027" rel="nofollow">real world <i>politics</i></a>&quot; to &quot;<i>academic</i> politics,&quot; a distinction I&#39;m more than able to identify and justify.  I&#39;m more aware than most when rhetoric is empty and I strive not to produce empty rhetoric myself.  If I do, you&#39;re more than welcome to 1) call me on it and 2) mock me for it.  Mercilessly.  But in this case I did nothing of the sort.  I indicted a particular brand of <i>academic</i> politics on a specific set of charges: namely, that its rhetoric consistently, as in <i>always</i>, outstripped its efficacy.</p>

<p>Joseph, One reason I wrote this post is because I divine a relationship between a particular breed of thought and a particular arrogance.  Your response here—which amounts to &quot;Yes I said patently offensive things about your intelligence and the value of your intellectual labor but whatever, get over it, move on&quot;—doesn&#39;t strike me as substantially different from the very tendency I criticized.  Point of fact, your response here makes me <i>less</i> inclined to believe that you&#39;re aware of your own rhetorical shortcomings and/or will ever be able to carry on a conversation in which you don&#39;t automatically assume <a href="http://www.realultimatepower.net/index4.htm" rel="nofollow">the real ultimate power</a> of your approach.  Sorry to put it so bluntly, but I think you&#39;ve donned some mighty impressive blinkers...and given your responses, I seriously doubt you&#39;re inclined to &quot;think the new&quot; or chase down those &quot;dimensions that elude [you].&quot;  You have your dimensions, think them emancipatory, and will probably stick to &#39;em.  Meanwhile, I&#39;ll settle for appreciating the supreme irony your intellectual &quot;development&quot; entails.</p>

<p>Luke, I suppose I don&#39;t want &quot;not that bad&quot; to be an operative category in discussions.  I&#39;d prefer something along the lins of &quot;cognizant of the implications of my statements.&quot;  </p>

<p>Matt, No cheerleading.  I thought I put that in my &quot;About Page.&quot;  Guess I didn&#39;t.  So <i>don&#39;t make me put that in my About Page</i>, see?</p></span>

So no substantial new post this evening. Plus I've been busy reading The Secret Epidemic , Astro Turf , The Rainy Season and watching The Constant Gardener . I have been the very picture of responsibility all day. I even condensed my latest dissertation chapter into a single paragraph. A useful exercise for those drowning in the details. All of which is only to say: Yes I've been a bore tonight. (I can't rain all the time.) I promise more entertainminig edification tomorrow.
