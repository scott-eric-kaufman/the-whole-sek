		<span id="comment-60416222-content"><p>Inasmuch as my dissertation engaged in biography, it focused on the life and work of Mortimer J. Adler.  Adler tried to accomplish, with his Institute for Philsophical Research (IPR), what W.J.T. Mitchell described.  The work of IPR resulted in books called &quot;The Idea of Freedom,&quot; &quot;The Idea of Justice,&quot; etc.  Those books approached larger ideas (the &#39;great ideas&#39; if you will) and tried to translate the terms of various authors such that agreements and disagreements about particular propositions could be clearly discerned. The reception by professionals, especially of the first two-volume work, &quot;The Idea of Freedom,&quot; was good.</p>

		<span id="comment-60425848-content"><p>Tim, I&#39;m highlighting this notion because it&#39;s an idea which has, if you can believe it, fallen out of favor in English departments.  That bit&#39;s from 1982, and as a foundational principle, guaranteed that certain statements would receive the critique they deserved.  There&#39;s no such check anymore.  I&#39;m not sure how to say this quickly -- i.e. without recapitulating the entire argument of the essay I cite Mitchell in -- but when theory &quot;won,&quot; historicism took over, but it did so by uncritically integrating certain theoretical ideas.  People accept them and move along to their historical work, which is, to my mind (and Mitchell&#39;s, and Adler&#39;s, it seems), exactly the wrong step.  We should talk about theory <i>more</i>, not less, and in a more sophisticated fashion than we currently do.  </p></span>

They were pebbles but I call them stones. Yes, on this occasion I laid in a considerable store. I distributed them equally between my four pockets, and sucked them turn and turn about. This raised a problem which I first solved in the following way. I had say sixteen stones, four in each of my four pockets these being the two pockets of my trousers and the two pockets of my greatcoat. Taking a stone from the right pocket of my greatcoat, and putting it in my mouth, I replaced it in the right pocket of my greatcoat by a stone from the right pocket of my trousers, which I replaced by a stone from the left pocket of my trousers, which I replaced by a stone from the left pocket of my greatcoat, which I replaced by the stone which was in my mouth, as soon as I had finished sucking it. Thus there were still four stones in each of my four pockets, but not quite the same stones. And when the desire to suck took hold of me again, I drew again on the right pocket of my greatcoat, certain of not taking the same stone as the last time. And while I sucked it I rearranged the other stones in the way I have just described. And so on. But this solution did not satisfy me fully. For it did not escape me that, by an extraordinary hazard, the four stones circulating thus might always be the same four. In which case, far from sucking the sixteen stones turn and turn about, I was really only sucking four, always the same, turn and turn about. But I shuffled them well in my pockets, before I began to suck, and again, while I sucked, before transferring them, in the hope of obtaining a more general circulation of the stones from pocket to pocket. But this was only a makeshift that could not long content a man like me. But not to go over the heartbreaking stages through which I passed before I came to it, here it is, in all its hideousness. All (all!) that was necessary was to put for example, to begin with, six stones in the right pocket of my greatcoat, or supply-pocket, five in the right pocket of my trousers, and five in the left pocket of my trousers, that makes the lot, twice five ten plus six sixteen, and none, for none remained, in the left pocket of my greatcoat, which for the time being remained empty, empty of stones that is, for its usual contents remained, as well as occasional objects. For where do you think I hid my vegetable knife, my silver, my horn and the other things that I have not yet named, perhaps shall never name. Good. Now I can begin to suck. Watch...</span></a></div>
