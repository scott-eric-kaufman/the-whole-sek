<p>Look who was wrong? That painting there has as much to do with Vincent&#39;s narrative as his style. It&#39;s the Doctor, which I could&#39;ve imagined Vincent getting around to, but it&#39;s the Doctor <em>in the nude</em>. There&#39;s nothing wrong with a nude painting of a man–or wouldn&#39;t be a few decades later after Charles II dies and England rejoices by stripping off the gloom of their imported Flemish masters and then their clothes. (To be followed quickly by a intense desire to live in a world in which flat surfaces and solid colors were anathema.) Point being:</p>
<p>Mathilda&#39;s painting of the Doctor is too Rococo for its time–because it&#39;s not of its time. He&#39;s encouraged her to paint not in the departing style of the Flemish Masters, nor in the coming style of French Baroque or endemic Neoclassicism, and why would he? He doesn&#39;t need live time in order, and Mathilda, his companion at the moment, is herself learning a little morality lesson about the knowledge the Time Lord grants: more often than not the world isn&#39;t ready for it. Not that she minds:</p>

<p>She looks quite please with her anachronistic creation. Her benefactor seems less so:</p>
<div class="photo-wrap photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef016302804354970d" id="photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef016302804354970d" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 500px;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef016302804354970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Doctor who - the impossible astronaut00011" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef016302804354970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef016302804354970d-500wi" title="Doctor who - the impossible astronaut00011" /></a></div>
<p>Note that even though the shots of Mathilda and King Charles II are both <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48044" target="_self">medium long shots</a>, she and the image of her Doctor are both bathed in natural light, as if they belong to the world beyond the window&#39;s grilles. King Charles II and his men are exactly where they ought to be: the King in the middle and lackeys at both flanks. They have come for the Doctor for reasons unknown–but their tone implies that whatever those reasons may be, the Doctor needs a grand entrance and the sooner the better.</p>
<div class="photo-wrap photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef016302805551970d" id="photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef016302805551970d" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 500px;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef016302805551970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Doctor who - the impossible astronaut00015" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef016302805551970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef016302805551970d-500wi" title="Doctor who - the impossible astronaut00015" /></a></div>
<p>Perhaps not <em>that </em>soon. Appearing from beneath the swaths of Mathilda&#39;s skirts suggests that King Charles&#39;s haste and <em>j&#39;accuse</em>-face may be warranted. The high <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48004" target="_self">angle of framing</a> here is completely warranted. The Doctor may not be physically powerless, but his given that his moral code only seems to allow him to significantly alter history when <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/02/time-can-be-written-and-will-be-try-and-keep-up" target="_self">its in need of a significant alteration</a>, the consequence of him having lost his social stature which much more likely lead to lots and lots of running. Which is exactly what Haynes has him do in the opening bits–and they are comedic &quot;bits&quot; in no uncertain terms–they establish both that he&#39;s no longer traveling with Amy and Rory but that he&#39;s no longer done with them (even when they fail to see him):</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>That&#39;s Rory&#39;s head you can&#39;t see failing to notice the Doctor trying to catch his attention. As I started watching these first few minutes–and keeping in mind I&#39;ve seen the entire Sixth Season–I found it difficult not to see these as the Season&#39;s narrative arc written small. Bear with me:&#0160;</p>
<ol>
<li>The Doctor&#39;s there, like the Silence, but Amy and Rory can&#39;t see him.</li>
<li>The Doctor&#39;s <em>always been there</em>, like the Silence, but nobody can see them.</li>
<li>The Doctor&#39;s happy not because he&#39;s alive–though I&#39;ve little doubt that pleases him–but because <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/02/doctor-who-amys-choice-rhetorical-film-analysis.html" target="_self">his plan to redeem himself worked</a>. Perhaps not in full, but fully enough for him to embark, alone, on a series of adventures through human time seemingly designed to taunt Amy and Rory. (The last time the Doctor went on walkabout the results&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Dead" target="_self">were</a>&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waters_of_Mars" target="_self">far</a>&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Time" target="_self">darker</a>, so much so I contend that the darkness left in the Tenth&#39;s wake is what the Eleventh&#39;s had to deal with throughout Season Six.)</li>
<li>The Doctor&#39;s no longer afraid of what he&#39;ll do, because he can&#39;t do any more damage to the universe than gambling that he could extinguish it back to life would somehow work.&#0160;</li>
<li>That it did is what allows him not only accept, but to crave the attention and flattery in oil of the otherwise insignificant Mathilda. Her ability to stand there, insignificantly, is a direct result of his actions, so whatever pleasure he gains from their interaction is because she exists, not because she exists in any particularly pleasing way.&#0160;</li>
<li>Other stuff you can suss out in the comments while I cook my wife and I dinner.</li>
</ol>
<p>I could go, but as aforementioned, it&#39;s dinner time and much as I would like sharing my notebook with you, I need food. Also, I wonder whether some of you wouldn&#39;t rather toss my notebook at me, in which case, slinking away to make some hash is still a solid idea.</p>

For a thousand years, Our Republic stood as the crowning achievement of civilized beings. But there were those who would set us against one another, and we took arms to defend of way of life against the Democrats. In doing so, we never suspected that the greatest threat came from within. The Democrat Party, and some within our own Senate, had conspired to create the shadow of racial animus using one of their own as the enemy’s leader. They had hoped to grind the Our Grand Republic into ruin. But the hatred in their hearts could not be hidden forever. As last, there came a day when our enemies showed their true natures. The Democrat Party hoped to unleash their destructive power against the Our Republic by assassinating the head of shadow government – Breitbart – and acquiring control of the reserve forces But the aims of the would-be tyrants were valiantly opposed by those without elitist, dangerous powers, who never went to school. Our loyal know-nothing troopers contained the insurrection within the Jefferson Memorial and quelled uprisings across the planet. The remaining Democrat conspirators will be hunted down and defeated. Any collaborators will suffer the same fate. These have been trying times, but we have passed the test. The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger. The war is over. The Sepratist Democrats have been defeated, and the Decmocrat rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning. In order to ensure the security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Global Empire, for a safe and secure society, which I assure you will last for 10,000 years. An Empire that will be continue to be ruled by this august body and a sovereign ruler chosen for life. An Empire ruled by the majority, ruled by a New Constitution. By bringing the entire galaxy under one law, one language, and the enlightened guidance of one individual, the corruption that plagued the Republic in its later years will never take root. Regional governors will eliminate the bureaucracy that allowed the Democract movement to grow unchecked. A strong and growing military will ensure the rule of law. Under the Empire’s New Order, our most cherished beliefs will be safeguarded. We will defend our ideals by force of arms. We will give no ground to our enemies and we will stand together against attacks from with or without. Let the enemies of the Empire take heed: Those who challenge Imperial resolve will be crushed. We have taken on a task that will be difficult, but the people of the Empire are ready for the challenge. Because of our efforts, the galaxy has traded war for peace and anarchy for stability. Billions of beings now look forward to a secure future. The Empire will grow as more planets feel the...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/03/shake-your-meaning-maker.html"><span><strong>Shake your meaning-maker</strong> So I've mentioned before that the final project in my class is a creative one in which students must occupy the position they've been analyzing all quarter–that of the meaning-making rhetor communicating something or other to a particular audience. Because I'm working with graphic novels, one of the ways I get them to think like a meaning-maker is ask them to find a song that epitomizes a particular book they've read. This exercise is far more difficult than it sounds, because it forces them to reflect upon (likely for the first time) what the lyric of their proposed song means and how that lyric relates to a book whose rhetorical and thematic complexity we've been discussing for weeks. It's the perfect exercise: It starts simple then turns fractal. This quarter, I went with Craig Thompson's Blankets as inspiration, which means the song needs to include equal parts evangelical Christianity, teenage infatuation, Künstlerroman, etc. No single song will perfectly reflect either Craig Thompson's understanding of his own development or any of my students' relation to that understanding, but the act of thinking through that mess will help them discover how they'd like their final projects to resonate with their intended audience. All of which is merely a preface to my declaration that the song I thought best epitomized Thompson's intent–in both lyrical intent and its relation to traditional form–was this one. (The lyrics can be found here.) I'm obviously playing a rigged game, what with me being the teacher and all, but the point is that I can make a very strong argument about how the thematic elements of that song communicate something very similar to the message of Thompson's novel ... and that I dare any of my students to proffer another case for a different song that's stronger than the one they think I'll make for mine. (Which means they'll have to anticipate a critical response and plan their feints and parries in advance.) Game on?</span></a></div>
