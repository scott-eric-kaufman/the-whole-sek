You might find this hard to believe, but for the past three seasons not only have I rooted for the Red Sox, I&#39;ve become a full-fledged fan.  I followed the trials and tribulations of Young Theo.  Alone in my living room watching the ALCS, I jumped up and down repeatedly in an embarrassing display of exuberance after Game 7.  So great had my hatred of the Yankees grown that I had forgotten 1986 and actually spoke the words &quot;I can&#39;t remember a better series than the 2005 ALCS.&quot;  Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have a rank, weather-beaten Mets cap in need of attention...</p></span>

(I mean, &quot;embrace&quot; in a manly, sports-guy sort of way, of course.)  Having been a Mets fan (mostly a long-suffering Mets fan) for a quarter of a century now and having recently moved to the People&#39;s Republic of Massachusetts, I&#39;ve started following the Red Sox as well, and few things have made me happier in recent years than seeing them kick the collective ass of the hated Yankees and then go on to Win It All.  I would have been happier to see the Mets win, of course, but I&#39;ve long given up expecting that to happen.  (I can tell you the exact moment I knew it was all over: the fourth game of the 1988 playoffs, when I was sitting in the right-field stands at Shea and pleading loudly with Davey to take Gooden out and he left him in and the game got out of hand and the Dodgers went on to beat an infinitely superior Mets team and then an infinitely superior Athletics team.  Bitter?  No, I&#39;m not bitter.  Just old and cranky.)</p>

<p>Anyway, let&#39;s hope Pedro can keep doing it (didn&#39;t he look great last night?) and the Metsies can overcome their lackadaisical start.  Ya gotta believe...</p></span>

According to unnamed Oxford University scientists, &quot;hundreds of lost Greek comedies, tragedies and epic poems will soon be revealed.&quot; Lost works by Sophocles, Euripides, Hesiod and &quot;other literary giants of the ancient world lost for millennia&quot; could run roughshod over the received wisdom in Classics departments, but even more interesting will be the response of Culture Warrior partisans to this unexpected ragnasveppur* from some Dead White Males. If the works of the Greek dramatists are only canonical by virtue of the historical contingencies of canonicity, what impact will the sudden appearance of Epigonoi, or The Progeny, the latest by Sophocles, have on the interpretations of Western Civilization and &lt;i&gt;human nature&lt;/i&gt; which piggyback Greek thought? Since The Progeny didn't belong to the Eliotic tradition, its inclusion in the canon could only be warranted by universalist claims about its literary merit. That wouldn't fly with folks who consider &quot;literary merit&quot; insufficient grounds for canonical status, you know, the ones who only grudging allow the currently canonical works of Sophocles and company squatting space because, well, they have been there an awful long time. But there's a glitch in their logic and its name is Sophocles. Most who support the expansion of the canon do so based on theoretical positions which belong, as Geoffrey Hartman says in a passage I quoted on The Valve yesterday, to &quot;a corpus of critical, philosophical and literary texts which [the work of Marx, Husserl, Heidegger, and Freud] incorporate and revise.&quot; Freud structured the psychoanalytic notions of human development on a universalist understanding of human nature he saw at work in Sophocles' plays. Had more plays been extant, his conception of human nature could have looked very, very different from the impenetrable shitmist of what now passes for psychoanalytic thought. The next fragment of The Progeny could read: Speaker A: Obolos for your thoughts. Speaker B: (pauses) Oedipus. Speaker A: That fucktard again? Speaker B: I wonder if anyone will ever take him seriously again. Speaker A: Take him seriously? That motherfucker? Speaker B: Suppose he repented. Speaker A: Repented what? Speaker B: Oh... (He reflects.) He wouldn't have to go into the details. Speaker A: (snidely) His being born? Speaker B: (wounded) I've nothing to say to you. Speaker A: (Step forward). You're angry? (Silence. Step forward.) Forgive me. (Silence. Step forward. Speaker A lays his hand on Speaker B's shoulder.) C'mon, guy. (Silence.) Give me your hand. (Speaker B half turns.) Embrace me guy! (Speaker B stiffens.) Don't be stubborn! (Speaker B softens. They embrace.) Speaker B: I'm sorry. Oedipus is a motherfucker. Still. (stutteringly resolute.) To treat a man...(gesture towards Thebes)...like that...I think that...no ...a human being...no...it's a scandal! Speaker A: (groaning, clutching his head.) I can't bear it...any longer...the way you go on...you've no idea, guy...it's terrible...I must go...(Speaker A waves his arms)...I'm going mad...(Speaker A collapses, his head in his hands)...I can't bear it...any longer... Speaker B: Do...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/the_cultural_lo.html"><span><strong>The Cultural Logic of Brad Pitt, or Does Tyler Durden Reify or Challenge Hegemonic Codes of Race, Class, Gender, and Regional or National Identity?</strong> The Conscientious Objector has had flattered me not once but twice in two days for not doing precisely what I'm about to do: mention a potentially interesting topic but have nothing insightful or entertaining to say about it. Part of me understands the value of studying popular culture and, to be a little more forceful, the need for analyzing forms of cultural production that influence contemporary society in addition to all the ones that don't. But the rest of me bristles at the knowledge that approx. seven months from now a couple of English professors will stand before their peers and discuss whether Brad Pitt's characters &quot;really explore radical or marginal locations outside the boundaries of the dominant culture, or are they only pseudo-revolutionaries-posing-as-rebels, but ultimately conforming to privileged, white, male, heterosexual, and American cultural norms?&quot; (The entire CFP can be found below the fold.) I'm as interested in &quot;Brad Pitt's postmodern subjectivity&quot; as anybody else, but are English professors to determine whether Brad Pitt's performances &quot;explore new postmodern constructions of race, class, gender, and national identity?&quot; But shouldn't this fall to Film Studies? If I sound like I'm repeating myself, well, I'm nuancing some of what I addressed earlier. I'm thinking more about the medium than the methodology now. And those are different issues. Maybe. I honestly believe in the social utility of studying popular culture. I only question whether English professors are the ones who ought to be doing it. That said, I can think of hundreds of reasons why English professors would be better suited to such analysis than anyone else in academia. Had I not cleaning galore to accomplish in the few short hours before Mrs. A. Cephalous returns from her pilgrimage to Kalamazoo, I'd compose a fully annotated list of every last one of 'em. For now all I can say is that because no one discipline is really equipped to study popular culture, when the chips are counted English departments have as much purchase to the claim as anyone else. Possibly even more. I only wish they could find some way to do it that didn't make us all look like jackasses. CFP: The Cultural Logic of Brad Pitt For the 2005 Western Literature Association Conference in Los Angeles, we plan to organize a panel on the film icon, Brad Pitt. Why Brad Pitt? As one of this generation's most popular actors, Pitt has explored many of the cultural tensions of our emerging postmodern era. Depicting masculine American whiteness in various states of crisis, his characters generally enact complex postmodern agencies; they are never wholly coherent, they are often self-destructive, and they generally rely on a certain amount of play--between stability and instability, between life and death, between autonomy and alter-dependency, between control and abandon. Simultaneously reifying and challenging hegemonic codes of race, class, gender, and regional or national identity, his characters explore the complex and changing postmodern cultural landscape. Tracing his performances through a variety of films and theoretical texts we hope to...</span></a></div>
