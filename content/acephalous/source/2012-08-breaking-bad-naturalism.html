But as I start to catch up on the years of episode breakdowns and critical analyses, I can't help but be a little annoyed by the repeated claim about the show's "realism." Joe Kugelmass <a href="http://kugelmass.wordpress.com/?s=the+wire#" target="_self">wrote about this<em>&nbsp;</em></a> vis-a-vis <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005NFJAWG/diesekoschmar-20" target="_self"><em>The Wire</em></a>, and though I can't seem to find the post, I want to give credit where it's due, because <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/08/would-someone-teach-these-people-how-to-plagiarize" target="_self">I'm no Zakaria</a>. Joe's point, in brief, is that people always claim that <em>The Wire </em>is a realistic portrayal of the tangled mess of conflicting interests that is the great city of Baltimore, except that isn't realistic in the least.

I'm not saying it's not clever or well-executed, only that it's highly stylized, <em>i.e. </em>not realistic and not attempting to be so.</p>
<p><em>Breaking Bad</em> is equally unrealistic, except unlike <em>The Wire</em>, whose overarching narrative does actually embrace a realistic ethos, <em>Breaking Bad </em>is a thoroughly naturalist narrative. What do I mean by "naturalist"? <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/what-is-the-reg.html" target="_self">Even I'm not entirely sure</a>. But a decent (if stripped) working definition might be that a naturalist work is any in which a person's character is determined by the restrictions of the social environment in which it operates. No matter what its author claims a naturalist narrative isn't a realistic project: it's a thought experiment that amounts to "If I place Person A into Environment B how will he or she react?"

<p><a class="asset-img-link" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0177443f019e970d-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0177443f019e970d" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breakingbad01" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0177443f019e970d-500wi" alt="Breakingbad01" /></a><br />Without giving away too much game, that's an image of a man who's just had half his brain blown into a cavity <em>and he's fixing his tie</em>. Is he about to die? Of course he is. The life expectancy of people in his situation is dire beyond the telling. But it's a powerful image of a man who risked everything with composure and is determined to die as subdued and dignified as he lived. Can a man actually take a pipe-bomb to the face and ablute himself? <em>Of course not</em>. Then why do people insist that <em>Breaking Bad</em> is a realistic portrayal of the perils of the methamphetamine trade? Because of scenes like what I'll call "The Story of Jesse and the Beans."</p>
<p>You'll remember that I <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/07/walking-and-talking-with-louie-and-liz" target="_self">praised <em>Louie </em>for its commitment to the two shot</a>. The two shot is one that has two people in the frame. (Can you guess what a three shot is?) The purpose of a two shot is create a connection between the characters through the process of accumulation. If you include two subjects in the same frame for an inordinate amount of screen-time the audience will consider them partnered regardless of whatever their actual relationship is. <a href="acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/02/doctor-who-vincent-and-the-doctor.html" target="_self">Playing against this instinct is why Bergman films create such discomfort</a>.&nbsp; The same logic appears in <em>Breaking Bad</em>, except the sequences aren't nearly so staged as Bergman's. A typical conversation on <em>Breaking Bad</em> isn't a two shot. It looks like "Walter, what do you have to say?"</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31617a04970b-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31617a04970b" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00002" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31617a04970b-500wi" alt="Breaking bad00002" /></a><br />And "Jesse, how do you feel about that?"</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0177443f1132970d-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0177443f1132970d" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00005" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0177443f1132970d-500wi" alt="Breaking bad00005" /></a><br />Their psychological and sociological differences are accentuated by filming them in a series of perpetual shot and reverse shots. They don't share the frame because they're not friends and barely even co-workers. Which brings us to the scene in which Walter invites Jesse over for dinner <em>with his wife.</em> The sudden shift to the two and three shots is glaring because it's painfully oblique to the status of their current relationships. So:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31617d15970b-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31617d15970b" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00022" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31617d15970b-500wi" alt="Breaking bad00022" /></a><br />"The Story of Jesse and the Beans" opens with a half-empty long shot. (Just compare it to <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/11/kick-ass-millar-.html" target="_self">a very similar scene in <em>Kick-Ass</em></a>.) All three half-occupy the bottom half of frame that's fronted by an empty chair. Moreover, the dominant diegetic light source pulls our eyes up to the chandelier, which means that when we search the frame for meaning we're incredibly aware of all the empty unlit space in the top half of the frame. These are three diminished people sharing a table with Elijah.</p>
<p>The composition of the shot further distances them: the white inner curtains flank Jesse and cut him off, compositionally speaking, from Skyler and Walter, who sit before the dark outer curtains. (I know: I need to figure out what curtains are called. Feel free to point me in the right direction.) The frame's split in three and each of these characters occupies their own bit of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptych" target="_self">triptych</a>. This isn't a realistic shot. It's a carefully staged psychological reflection of the character's current relations to each other. This shot only seems realistic because it's ostensibly conventional: we're accustomed to watching families eat dinner together and that's what we seem to have here. Only we don't. There's a tension between the compositional elements in the frame and the narrative being communicated through it, and that tension mirrors that being felt by the characters.</p>
<p>About which more in the next post, which will be arriving shortly.</p>
<p>*Clearly I'm kidding. I just covered too much ground to come up with a snappy title.</p>
<p>**And before you ask why it took me so long to watch a critically  acclaimed show about an educator who his cancer from his wife, <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/how-sek-hid-can.html">I've already been over that</a>. Does this resemblance make me look tough?</p>

Much better than my take on BB which I was never fully comfortable with because it separated form from ideology. My take has been that BB is great TV formally, but it has shitty politics (I see it as an Ayn Rand sycophantic representation of &quot;the real world.&quot;) Yet, that has always made me uncomfortable because as a die-hard Marxist Cultural Studies wonk, I believe form and ideology can&#39;t be cleaved apart quite so easily. So naturalism. Wat a great thought. Walt as a latter day McTeague!</p></span>

<p>But I&#39;m a sucker for shot breakdowns, and another way to look at the dinner table shot is through the rule-of-thirds. Their heads occupy the central plane, and the upper-left and upper-right corners (above Skyler and Walter) both contain plants, while the upper-middle section is the light. Walter&#39;s raison-d&#39;etre (at first sincere, now a pantomime) has been &quot;family,&quot; a seemingly natural and wholesome and organic concept -- hence the plants hovering above the two family members. However, the light is artificial in every way, and that&#39;s what hovers above the outcast who introduced the organic family man to the world of synthesized speed. (But I wouldn&#39;t doubt if those plants weren&#39;t real.) </p>

<p>The empty chair in the bottom-center section? That&#39;s for us, the audience who&#39;s intruding upon this forced moment. But it also cuts Jesse off; he&#39;s the only person in the shot who&#39;s literally half a person, while the bottom-left and bottom-right sections allow Skyler and Walter to have full bodies. This is somehow fitting, since one of the operating themes behind the narrative is that &quot;family&quot; is necessary to be a complete person; while Walter and Skyler have seemingly maintained that in the face of crazy odds, Jesse has failed -- with his own parents, then with Jane, and again with Andrea and her son Brock. No family = an incomplete person.</p>

<p>However, one of the other hallmarks of BB is the p.o.v. camera located on an inanimate-yet-moving object, often in time-lapse. That camera has been located in places like the bumpers of cars or on pick-axes. It places the audience in a position of near-helplessness; we&#39;re simply along for the ride, and any audience choice of what to focus on in the shot is almost violently removed. I&#39;ve not taken crystal meth, but from what I understand, the tweaker loses control over what to focus on and will hyper-focus on whatever&#39;s in front of him -- a game, a conversation, food, etc. The tweaker is in a position of near-helplessness, and is simply along for the ride.</p>

<p>I wondered if while writing this post you heard a little Zizek sputtering in the back of your head about how Breaking Bad is real <i>precisely because of its unreality</i>. That the hyper-stylized shots that put the audience into uncomfortable positions forces them confront, consciously or not, the specter of artificiality that hovers over so many of the symbolic social structures, relationships and rituals that we deal with every day -- husband/wife, parent/child, boss/worker, teacher/student, law/criminal, in-laws. We tend to accept them as given and natural because that&#39;s how people get through the day. The unrealistic hyper-stylized shots move us outside of those symbolic structures, and that&#39;s where the real intrudes. </p>

<p>...or something like that...</p></span>

I couldn't be happier. Unfortunately, it appears that George Michael's not the only new member of the UCI community. A ghost was spotted disembarking from a flight into John Wayne Memorial Airport: I've never been a prouder Anteater. Happy days are here again, my friends. (Even if they are wearing socks and sandals.)</span></a></div>

Because of scenes like what I’ll call “The Story of Jesse and the Beans.” I suggested that the answer is the power of conventions: if you shoot a family sitting down to dinner, the audience will peg the frame as being realistic because they've seen so many television families sit down to dinner. And there's something to that. Quite a bit actually: film conventions normalize human relations. Consider the last frame from the previous post: Even if you've never seen the show, you know exactly what this is: a family sitting down to dinner. How do you know it's a family? Because there's a husband on the right and a wife on the left and a son in the middle? How do you know that's a son? Because he's smaller than the father and the mother. (Even if Aaron Paul were taller than Bryan Cranston or Anna Gunn, the director, Colin Bucksey, could make him appear smaller by staging the scene as he does here and simply placing Paul further away from the camera.) How do we know it's dinner? Because they're at the dinner table. But they eat breakfast at the dinner table too, which is why Bucksey doesn't backlight the window and instead employs the light above the table to illuminate the scene. I know they could be eating before dawn, but the mother has a wine glass in her hand and people don't conventionally drink wine with breakfast. All of which is a long way of saying that the elements in the frame demand it be read as an image of a nuclear family sitting down to dinner. This shot is effective because its formal conventions militate toward the nuclear family interpretation, whereas our knowledge about the content of this situation requires we draw the exact opposite conclusion. The tension between form and content creates an awkwardness analogous to the awkwardness each of the three characters in the scene currently feels. That's not a husband on the right nor is it a wife on the left: that's a terrorist on the right and that's his hostage on the left. That son isn't their son, though it could be said that the father adopted him—except that this surrogate son is only at this dinner table because he stopped by to break up with his fake father. And the mother only knows this soon-to-be-emancipated not-son as the father's former drug dealer. At this precise moment in time these people couldn't be more unrelated, but if I show you that frame your brain will insist that it's a nuclear family sitting down to dinner. Director Bucksey takes advantage of this. As I noted in the previous post, the sense of isolation experienced by each of these characters is typically reinforced by sequencing their conversations as a series of shots and reverse shots. The camera tells you...</span></a></div>
