It is the undefendable slapshot in the game of American politics, the justification for affairs foreign and domestic. He need not say anymore.

How can he not talk about the impact their fall had on American politics, on affairs both foreign and domestic? How can he concentrate on the lives of the engineers who &quot;unbuild&quot; these fallen metaphors of American eminence when they fell because they were metaphors and were mourned for much the same reason?

and its use has been restricted by international accord because of the
damage it does to the atmosphere's protective ozone layer. The threat
it posed at the Trade Center was more immediate, and stemmed from the
fact that it is a heavy gas and it aggressively displaces the oxygen in
the air that people breathe. With the huge quantities potentially
involved here (as much as 168,000 pounds, under pressure, if the tanks
remained intact), a sudden leak would fill the voids underground and
spread across the surface of the pile, suffocating perhaps hundreds of
workers caught out on the rough terrain and unable to move fast. To
make matters worse, if the Freon cloud came in contact with open
flames, of which there were plenty here, it would turn into airborne
forms of hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids and also phosgene gas,
related to the mustard gas used during World War I. Then it would go
drifting. Evacuation sirens were installed around the edges of the
pile, but in tests they often failed. Evacuation maps were printed with
elaborate routes and mustering points, but of course they were not
read. People accepted the danger. The standard advice, &quot;Just run like
hell,&quot; was delivered with a little shrug. Everyone knew that if the
Freon came hunting for you at the center of the pile, you would succumb.</p></blockquote><p>I would want the most competent person I could find in charge of determining whether Freon still posed a problem.&nbsp; Then again, I would want the most competent I could find in charge of a number of other issues, foremost among them the whole business of governing the United States and running the War in Iraq.&nbsp; Why did the overwhelming danger, the potential loss of human life trump the old boy's connections in this case?&nbsp; The answer, quite simply, is that the old boys had run from the towers when they fell, whereas the working class ran towards them.&nbsp; The old boys were busy grandstanding—holding bullhorns in front of flags, running around blaming some people who blaming some people for some people's statements about some other people—whereas the people who would unbuild the Twin Towers were on site, shovels in hand, bucket in hands, for days on end.&nbsp; They unbuilt the Towers because they cared more about people than politics.&nbsp; And while it should be said that the statement &quot;caring more about people than politics&quot; is more often than not the empty word of a politician to the core, the majority of the people involved in the unbuilding were engineers, construction workers, fire fighters and the like.&nbsp; I don't think they imagined a future career in politics.&nbsp; (Some of them did, mind you.&nbsp; Two in particular.&nbsp; But when you deal with human beings you have to expect the occasional opportunist.&nbsp; That there weren't more, I suppose, speaks to the validity of my point.)</p>

<p>Thus ends this somber post.&nbsp; I should teach more fun material this late in the quarter.&nbsp; </p>

You might want to watch Keanu Reeves running around in leather, Adam dear, but I have better things to do with my life.&quot; Book Stud (who, despite her name, is a woman) comes to his defense: &quot;And I think we can all agree on the leather – whether it’s worn by Keanu or Carrie Ann. Mmmm, leather.&quot; Adam Roberts also does a decent job defending him . . . oh, I see now, himself. Good show! Denizens of Slashdot, on the other hand, started to discuss the article but were quickly derailed by talk of short skirts and concluded by praising LINUX. I feel no need to defend him, as the women I know who watch science-fiction—wife excluded, since she never watched science fiction prior to our hooking up— say things &quot;Keanu, leather, Mm, Keanu, Dance Party Zion, Mmm, The Groosalugg, calf-skin, bulging pecs, Mmmm.&quot; So I don't doubt that the mainstreaming of science fiction over the past decade has had two effects: 1) more Mmmm-worthy actors and actresses starring in science fiction films and series and 2) more high quality directors and writers willing to work on them. This logic even applies to the scum clinging to the underside of the barrel. Just compare the production values of this to those of this. (Thanks to Rich for pointing this out.)</span></a></div>

Vampires?</strong> Today I learned that Octavia Butler's published a new novel. It is not the final installment in her Parable series, I add with anger born of deep disappointment. (Parable of the Talents ranks among her best works and I've been awaiting the next volume for what feels like decades now.) It's called Fledgling and it's about . . . vampires. The strength of my reluctance to read another novel about vampires so long as I live falls somewhere between Schwarzeneggerian and Samsonian.[1] Why the reluctance? Her name is Ann Rice. Her Halloween parties were notorious in N'awlins as I adolesced and I attended more than I could care to. Watching all the &quot;vampires&quot; stalk her beautiful home in a desperate attempt to impress her . . . or even worse, witnessing the same conversation circle the room after Interview with the Vampire hit the silver screen: &quot;Is that Brad Pitt? I don't know. I heard he's in costume.&quot; &quot;There's Tom Cruise! You can tell 'cause he's so short.&quot; So I don't like vampires or novels about vampires or films about vampires or tele . . . nevermind, I love the only television show I've ever watched about vampires. What separated Buffy the Vampire Slayer from all the nocturnal emissions of self-identifying goths? In 500 words or less: Joss Whedon. The show bore his fingerprints. When it didn't—when I had to dust the set for evidence of his presence—it stumbled. Over nothing. But somehow still managed to powderize every bone its body in the stumbling. Point being: I trust Mr. Whedon's ability to spin a yarn I want to hear. I trust Butler too. I didn't think I'd want to read books co-opted by every fad to strike academic pavement these past decades: feminism, post-colonialism, post-humanism, critical race theory, and I could continue. But her novels are smarter than academia's reductive readings let on. If ideas are bowling pins then Butler juggles them deftly, letting them light briefly on her fingertips before sending them into the air again . . . for academics to grab and run away with. That's the Butler I first encounter: a juggler with no pins to juggle. But as I read her works I realized that she's one of those not-rare-at-all authors who's much more intelligent than her critics suggest (or are); that the ideas they swipe from her air are handled improperly. I have so much faith in her at this point that I'm almost inclined to read Fledgling. I've got my finger on the &quot;Two Day 1-Click&quot; button and I'm not afraid to press it. So I am. But I shouldn't be. Implicit faith should be implicit faith? When you think about it, this issue isn't entirely divorced from what I was talking about the other day. Do you have faith in thems that speak or do you desire content above all else? [1] Random blip: Has anyone else who knows German had the misfortune of accidentally reading Arnold's name? I know what the...</span></a></div>
