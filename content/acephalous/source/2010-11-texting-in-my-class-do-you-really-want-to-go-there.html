Now, as your hands start to dance and your arms and shoulders gently flex, I want you to look at your face, the way your eyes shift from your crotch and then up, to your left and your right, then back to your crotch.

			<p>When I read articles like the one Margaret Soltan <a href="http://www.margaretsoltan.com/?p=27702">linked to</a> about <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/AP8e363749be8c45a8bac929b79774336b.html">texting in class</a>, I can&#39;t help but be thankful that I once took—and took to heart what I learned in—a course on feminist pedagogy.

<p>It&#39;s impossible to police 400 students, and I admire the fact that Dr. Thomas is not only paying attention, but that he <em>cares</em> enough to walk out of his class.  I have a feeling the same can&#39;t be said of those who teach, for example, similarly large &quot;lectures&quot; consisting of canned PowerPoints from textbook companies.  The students have no incentive <em>not</em> to text, because the material on the screen is identical to the material in their outrageously expensive textbooks.  No synergy happens in that room—the material is not re-purposed by an expert in ways that illuminate confusing passages in the book—it is simply repeated in a bullet format that oversimplifies the material&#39;s complexity.  But I&#39;m here to talk about how to discourage students from texting in class, not complain about the cookie-cutter education so many students are receiving.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure it works in larger classes, but in my horseshoe of a classroom, all it takes to discourage texting is to ask them to do a little visualization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine that you are in a room full of people, each and every one of whom can see you.  Picture yourself slipping your hands beneath your desk and placing them between your legs.  Now, as your hands start to dance and your arms and shoulders gently flex, I want you to look at your face, the way your eyes shift from your crotch and then up, to your left and your right, then back to your crotch.  I want you to focus on that shifty look, that look that says, &quot;I&#39;m doing something I shouldn&#39;t be doing, in a place where doing so is inappropriate.&quot;  Look around the room, now, and ask yourself: &quot;What exactly do you think your classmates thought you were doing there?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone giggles without needing to hear the punchline, but here&#39;s the best part of it: the first time someone in the room tries to text, their classmates giggle again; and again; and again; and again.  The punchline becomes a good-natured, self-policing policy—so much so that I once had a student come up to me before class and ask to be allowed to keep his self-phone on, as he was expecting an important text from a family member.  As with cheating, I can&#39;t be 100 percent positive that no texting occurs during my class, but at the very least I&#39;ve created an environment that&#39;s hostile to the practice.</p>
<p>By walking out, Dr. Thomas did the same, which is why I&#39;m tipping my hat to him here.</p>

If people use a cellphone in class, they are obviously waiting time, but if students use paper or their computer, they are obviously paying attention? I&#39;ve frequently used a cellphone to take notes, if my computer was in the shop or accidentally forgotten. </p>

<p>How about you let your students use whatever technology is easiest for them, and encourage attention in other ways - such as a backchannel, polling programs, and asking students to write a two-minute response to a question and pass them to the aisle?</p>

<p>It is fine to point out to your student that maintaining eye contact in class is professional etiquette, but indirectly accusing students of public masturbation because they do not use the technology of your choice is not courteous either. It would be better to risk letting students &quot;get away&quot; with texting, especially when it really comes down to a personal pet peeve.</p></span>

You&#39;re not confused, you&#39;re just disingenuously ignoring the obvious: pen and paper are great at note-taking and not so great at distraction, whereas a phone is abysmal at note-taking but just phenomenal at providing distractions. (A computer is between those poles; I don&#39;t allow them in my seminars, which aren&#39;t note-intensive anyway.)</p></span>

<p>I think they&#39;re pretty related.  Students would engage a lot more if they weren&#39;t forced to pay through the nose for an environment that does nothing to foster learning.  I tell everyone I can that doing two years at a community college is the best thing educationally, since your first two years at a &quot;real&quot; school will be spent entirely in gigantic, useless classrooms.</p>

<p>Fighting cell phone use in class is a laudable goal, but if that prof really wanted to be a hero, he&#39;d fight gigantic lecture classes that help no one.</p></span>

This is fairly uncommon, so I wasn&#39;t quite ready for it.  I did the same thing you do, by rearranging the tables so everyone can see everyone else, and it stopped immediately. They were suddenly accountable to their peers (and me) and had nowhere to hide.  The day I first did this was the most productive day of that class.  As far as texting is concerned, I don&#39;t really care about that, so long as they are not making noise or distracting others.  I figure they will get out of the class what they put in. I did notice, though, that texting halted as well, although I said nothing about it.    </p></span>

Feel better? Me too. Next, pour a cup of water in the sauce-pan and bring it to a boil. Place the metal bowl on top of it and add 1) about half the chocolate, 3) the vanilla extract, and 3) enough of your favorite dessert liquor to cover it. Stir it and let your makeshift double-boiler melt the chocolate into the liquor. Take the melted chocolate mixture and add it to the fucking tofu. Add about half the honey and blend until it's thoroughly mixed. Use the rest of the honey to regulate the consistency. (Think pourable pudding.) Pour the mixture into the pie crust. If you'd like to make your own crust, you can. (I can't. I've ruined many a fine filling by pouring it into a tragedy of a from-scratch crust.) Place in the refrigerator for a few hours. Remove from the refrigerator and amaze everyone with the quality cheesecake you just made. They'll be genuinely impressed so long as you don't tell them what's in it. *I meant to make this a series, but then again, I've meant to write a lot of things I've never gotten around to writing, so there you go. **Myself included.</span></a></div>
