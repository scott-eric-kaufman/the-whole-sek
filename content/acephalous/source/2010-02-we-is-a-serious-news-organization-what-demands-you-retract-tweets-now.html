can you not respect a corporate non-entity who insists on granting
Ebert a doctorate for the sole purpose using &quot;Prof.&quot; as a diminutive?
More to the point: how can you not pity the poor Breitbart intern who,

Because this is what impresses Andrew Breitbart: the retraction of
tweets in which people call tea-baggers by the doubly ignorant name
they chose for themselves.*<br /><br />The demand to stop calling
tea-baggers the name they gave themselves is, remarkably, not the
dumbest part of this tweet-retraction crusade: that would be the
faux-outrage Pam Meister musters upon learning that Ebert&#39;s tweets
don&#39;t rise to the level of &quot;<a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/pmeister/2010/02/09/teabaggers-roger-ebert-trashes-his-own-fans-and-palin-on-twitter/">informed commentary</a>.&quot;
She suggests, with a straight face, that the lack of sustained
commentary by Ebert is a grave failure of character, not a feature
inherent in the Twitter&#39;s 140 character limit; and she does this, of
course, without acknowledging <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/archives.html">the vast archive of his writing</a>

acquainted with Google than her fellow tea-baggers, but the point
remains: she thinks Ebert should write tweets with more characters than
Twitter allows, and until he does, she will be very, very cross with
him.<br /><br />Which is terrible, terrible news, as the <a href="http://www.esquire.com/print-this/roger-ebert-0310">odds of someone as soft as Ebert</a> weathering this tweet-retraction campaign are <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/02/roger_eberts_last_words_cont.html">slim indeed</a>.<br /><br />*They can <a href="http://www.reteaparty.com/2009/02/27/rick-santelli-is-as-mad-as-hell-chicago-tea-party/">pull down their site</a> in an effort to deny it, but Google remembers that <a href="http://74.125.155.132/search?q=cache:W71X2n6hf_4J:www.reteaparty.com/2009/02/27/rick-santelli-is-as-mad-as-hell-chicago-tea-party/">they were the ones who started using &quot;tea-bag&quot; as a verb</a>,

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8b56ad4970b-content"><p>Two points.  First, you cannot expect a real right-wing intern to be equipped to recognize the sarcasm; he will have led a relatively short, relatively irony-deficient life in which the phrase &quot;Didn&#39;t know that until the MSM told me&quot; will have always been a serious complaint.  Second, the early appearance of the sign with the slogan &quot;Tea Bag The Liberal Dems Before They Tea Bag You&quot; indicates awareness of defamatory meanings of the term; indeed, defamation of &#39;Democrat liberals&#39; and the like has often been tied to various gay-panic slurs, so it&#39;s really inconceivable that that seminal Teabagger wasn&#39;t aware of the specific <i>Pecker</i> meaning.</p></span>

<p>What&#39;s next for Andy?  Is he going to demand history retract its indictment of Nixon for being a crook and a tool?  Nature to retract its attack on his waistline?  Happyfeet to retract his earlier spelling error? </p>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/02/30-rock.html"><span><strong>A technical question about cameras, film, and 30 Rock.</strong> After a trying week of marking papers, teaching, and generally being run ragged, I spent far too much time last weekend watching 30 Rock. As to the content of the show, all I can say is that I find it remarkable that a program dedicated to the inside baseball of running a network variety show is even intelligible, much less popular. Then I remember The Muppet Show exists or watch episodes of Saturday Night (not yet Live) from the year I was born, realize how old the trope is and find it remarkable that 30 Rock managed to enliven it. If pressed, I'd argue that its success has something to do with the meaningful inclusion of the network brass, which is in marked contrast from Lorne Michaels playing himself on SNL, but tonight I'm more interested in why the cast seems to have such huge heads: In this frame, the camera and lighting conspired to make Tracy Morgan's character, Tracy Jordan, look like something the first 10,000 fans under the age of 13 receive when they come through the gate. How did this happen? I don't know for sure, but thanks to an article [.pdf] in the Spring 2009 issue of Exposure magazine, I think I can make an under-educated guess. In it, chief cinematographer Matthew Clark says he employs wide-angle cameras to create a shallow depth of field in order to &quot;lend a sense of immediacy to what's going on,&quot; which is all well and good, except that wide-angle cameras do the opposite. He also notes that because the sets are so small, they are warmly and dimly lit, so in order to create any contrast, he has to shoot with a wider iris to allow in more light, and doing so diminishes the depth of field. It would seem that balance is struck: wide-angle creates a greater depth of field, the low-lighting and wider iris shallow it out. The only problem, as evidenced by the frame above, is that the balance is frequently out of whack, and because wide-angle lenses exaggerate the distance between objects, whenever a character leans forward, their heads appear much bigger than the bodies they're attached to. I think. I welcome those of you who know more about cameras, lenses, lighting and film stock to correct me.</span></a></div>
