Remember that close-ups are meant to suggest intimacy, whereas medium shots are designed to give some sense of body language. In terms of scale, this medium close-up provides intimate access to her face as she shoots Don a plea, while simultaneously allowing enough frame to depict the familiarity of Dr. Rosen's body language. He's distant from her (emotionally) but doesn't know it (physically); she's distant from Don (physically) but acutely feels it (emotionally); and Don's somewhere back there on the elevator, but the camera's not aligned with his perspective anymore so his feelings are absent from this shot. (If it were his perspective, the eyeline match wouldn't be slightly frame-left.) But not from the scene. This is the first example of the &quot;collaboration&quot; between the two, so it should come as no surprise that after Dr. Rosen enters the elevator, Don remembers he's forgotten his cigarette: The medium shot is perfunctory, because its main purpose is to capture Don's exaggerated gesture. The fact that the gesture's exaggerated is important, or would be if Dr. Rosen were paying attention. (Which he seems not to be.)

<p>The title of the episode, &quot;The Collaborators,&quot; is so obviously meant to be evocative that it almost sinks beneath its own freight. The episode&#39;s foremost &quot;collaboration&quot; occurs between Don Draper and his upstairs neighbor, Sylvia Rosen, who are acting out the transparent stratagems of Updike&#39;s titular <em>Couples</em> (1968). Though Updike&#39;s novel covers the time addressed in earlier seasons, its particular combination of adultry and war is relevant here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This pattern, of quarrel and reunion, of revulsion and surrender, was repeated three or four times that winter, while airplanes collided over Turkey, and coups transpired in Iraq and Togo[.] (161)</p>

(And <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/apr/12/john-le-carre-spy-anniversary" target="_self">we well know how accurate that novel is</a>.) Consider the first time Don and Sylvia play &quot;collaborators.&quot; The scene begins with a point-of-view shot from Don&#39;s perspective as the elevator door opens on Sylvia and her husband, Dr. Arnold Rosen, arguing over money:</p>

<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d42d03e1e970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Mad men00120" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d42d03e1e970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d42d03e1e970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mad men00120" /></a><br />The director of this episode, some clown by the name of Jon Hamm, uses this medium close-up to great effect. Remember that close-ups are <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/09/game-of-thrones-winter-is-coming-for-will-and-bran.html#1" target="_self">meant to suggest intimacy</a>, whereas medium shots are designed to give some sense of body language. In terms of scale, this medium close-up provides intimate access to her face as she shoots Don a plea, while simultaneously allowing enough frame to depict the familiarity of Dr. Rosen&#39;s body language. He&#39;s distant from her (emotionally) but doesn&#39;t know it (physically); she&#39;s distant from Don (physically) but acutely feels it (emotionally); and Don&#39;s somewhere back there on the elevator, but the camera&#39;s not aligned with his perspective anymore so his feelings are absent from this shot. (If it were his perspective, the eyeline match wouldn&#39;t be slightly frame-left.) </p>
<p>But not from the scene. This is the first example of the &quot;collaboration&quot; between the two, so it should come as no surprise that after Dr. Rosen enters the elevator, Don remembers he&#39;s forgotten his cigarette:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017eea449b72970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Mad men00118" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017eea449b72970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017eea449b72970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mad men00118" /></a><br />The medium shot is perfunctory, because its main purpose is to capture Don&#39;s exaggerated gesture. The fact that the gesture&#39;s exaggerated is important, or would be if Dr. Rosen were paying attention. (Which he seems not to be.) But Don puts on a show <em>just in case</em> and zips back up the elevator:</p>
<p>

Whether she knew he was also playing this game at this point is unclear. That she wanted it to be one of the days he did goes without saying, but her attractiveness here isn&#39;t a function of being &quot;made up&quot; so much as being natural. Which reminds Don of something:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017eea44ed60970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Madmananimdon" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017eea44ed60970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017eea44ed60970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Madmananimdon" /></a><br />If you click you can see the subtle hint of a <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/01/follow-that-thought.html" target="_self">thinking zoom</a> that makes the reverse from the shot above more significant. Instead of reversing back to the door as Don enters it, the audience is presented with another point-of-view shot from Don&#39;s perspective: </p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d42d0cc16970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Madmananimdon01" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d42d0cc16970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d42d0cc16970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Madmananimdon01" /></a><br />Instead of entering Sylvia Rosen&#39;s apartment to continue playing &quot;collaborations,&quot; the camera reverses into Don&#39;s memory. Note how the same subtle zoom works in two different ways here: the first begins with a close-up and moves into a closer-up, and because the perspective belongs to the audience, it believes that it is &quot;getting inside Don&#39;s head.&quot; And it is, as evidenced by the second zoom, which moves from a medium into a closer medium and is clearly from a perspective within the diegetic space:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017eea450b52970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Mad men00029" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017eea450b52970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017eea450b52970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mad men00029" /></a><br />Young Don&#39;s. The subtle zoom here is a young boy staring at a prostitute into whose house his pregnant stepmother has brought him. There is a lot to untangle here, but the main point is the very subtle way in which the memory of young Don&#39;s time in the bordello is coloring what&#39;s about to happen between elder Don and Sylvia Rosen. Because remember what Sylvia and her husband were arguing about earlier? In case you forgot, here&#39;s how her encounter with elder Don ends:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c38a1c1d7970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Mad men00054" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c38a1c1d7970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c38a1c1d7970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mad men00054" /></a><br />They&#39;re not playing &quot;collaborators&quot; anymore: the movement between his memory and the present moment makes it clear that, in Don&#39;s mind, they&#39;re playing &quot;prostitute.&quot; And they&#39;re doing so while being informed of yet another U.S. setback in Vietnam because of the Tet Offensive, which itself followed on the heels of the Koreans taking the USS <em>Pueblo</em>. Death and violence are not <em>visible</em> on screen, but their presence is pervasive. As, for example, is the case with Peter and his game of &quot;collaboration,&quot; which begins innocently enough:</p>
<p>

Which it seems to be until one of the wives stops by Pete Campbell&#39;s apartment in the city:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017eea452fe8970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Mad men00158" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017eea452fe8970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017eea452fe8970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mad men00158" /></a><br />Yet again, the woman is playing &quot;collaborator,&quot; and clearly enjoying her role in what she believes to be their affair. However, after sex, she tries to talk to Pete about the covert eperations they will undertake: cars parked near rather than next to mailboxes or on the street rather than in the driveway—the secret, sacred curb dances of suburban love. The reclining long shot of her as she snaps on her special lingerie seems to indicate attraction, as this is a clearly attractive, nearly naked woman offering to play her part:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d42d1018b970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Mad men00056" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d42d1018b970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d42d1018b970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mad men00056" /></a><br />Pete looks at her and <em>wishes she were a prostitute</em>. So he just starts playing &quot;prostitute&quot; anyway. He walks up to her and invades her space, but instead of an intimate close-up of the sort that would be appropriate, given they&#39;ve just been intimate, Pete looks at her, gently touches her hair and says</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017eea454f1e970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Mad men00060" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017eea454f1e970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017eea454f1e970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mad men00060" /></a><br />That we can&#39;t see his face as he delivers this blow isn&#39;t a surprise. After all, only one person can play &quot;prostitute&quot; at a time. Sylvia and this woman are both forced into the role of playing prostitute by someone they considered their collaborator, but while the outcome of Don&#39;s mid-course game-change is merely violence on the radio, the off-screen violence this woman suffers is more personal:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d42d12711970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Mad men00097" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d42d12711970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d42d12711970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mad men00097" /></a><br />In terms of scale and angle, this shot nearly mirrors the one above it, in that both register the prolongation of a moment of pain in a medium close-up. The first pain, in the panel above this one, is psychological, in that she&#39;s merely be made to feel like a whore; the second pain is also psychological, in that she has lost both her first collaborator, her husband, and must run to her second lost collaborator, Pete. But the second pain is also physical, because her first collaborator beat the shit out of her. But he did so off-screen, leaving Pete and Trudie to deal with the repercussions of violence.</p>
<p>And this is the key to the episode: the deaths and violence that happen off-screen are beginning to intrude into the lives of these characters. Such things have happened before on <em>Mad Men</em>, but they seem to be coming at an accelerated pace. Why? Because the game is changing, as are the players, but the game&#39;s not merely evolving from one into another, as it seemed previously; now the rules of the game are being changed such that it&#39;s the bottom of the third inning, the batter asks the umpire if he can take two free throws instead trying to hit that wicked curve again <em>and is being given the go-ahead</em>.</p>

From a television show! This @amandamarcotte claims to like quality television? Well here's one show she can no longer watch: JUSTIFIED. twitter.com/yesnicksearcy/…— nick searcy (@yesnicksearcy) April 13, 2013 The problem with this logic extends beyond the fact that conservatives devote Russian steppes of bandwidth to discrediting the idea that actors ought to participate in the public sphere. They start highly effective Twitter-campaigns to boycott actors and employers who make overtly political statements because they believe, deep in their ideological core, that people involved in the production of televisual entertainment have nothing to add to the national conversation. We're talking deep personal convictions here. They'd never enthusiastically embrace the statement of a character actor just because who am I kidding of course they would. They don't hate Hollywood -- they hate that the majority of it thinks their values are antediluvian. And when someone from Hollywood agrees with them? They just can't handle it. Every conservative celebrity-of-the-month becomes the John-Paul-George-and-Ringo of Twitter for awhile. (Adam Baldwin's either sitting alone crying on the abandoned set of Chuck or mercilessly pounding his Twitter trying to make Twitchy love him again.) But the thing about Twitter-campaigns and its meth-dependent scribe is that it all amounts to chatter amongst like-minded folks. Conservatives on Twitter form tiny circles of self-congratulation whose sole purpose is being sky-hooked into illusory importance by a service, Twitchy, that only exists to reinforce that delusion. No fiendish liberal could come up with a plan that mollifies conservative egos with the subtlety of Twitchy. Once they scale Malkin's xerostomic mount they feel like they've made it -- who cares if their throats are too parched to say anything else? It's not like they said much of value before. Take Nick Searcy's declaration above. He will never be more beloved by bigots than he is right now. This is the summit for him. All that was required of him to reach it was a profoundly impotent public statement. No longer will Amanda be able to turn on her television on Tuesday nights and watch Justified because ... because ... because Nick Searcy said so. You'd think someone who's portrayed as many officers of the law as Searcy has would understand the concept of enforceability, but apparently he's more concerned with being Conservative Internet Hero Du Jour than actually saying something that might make sense. But at least he attacked Amanda in a way that might hurt her feelings! Because I'm sure his empty threat to take away toys he doesn't own via means he can't control must really sting.</span></a></div>

The Library came after me, then thanked me for the chase. Terrible emails were sent. Cookies arrived. I tried to file. I wanted to kill myself. Was nearly arrested. My cat died. I was covered in blood. Arrived in England. To a volcano. Returned home to a forest fire. Followed by a kidney stone. That brings us to 2010 and doesn't include any events that could topple local governments. It doesn't include my sordid current stalkers or Porch Wars or any of the other random things that never happen to anyone that regularly happen to me.</span></a></div>
