</p>

			<div class="entry-more">
				


<p>First, I flash a paragraph from one of the few citations Ben-Shahar provides onto the wall.&#0160; Then, I tell them to pick out all the words they know but wouldn&#39;t ordinarily think to use, paying particular attention to active verbs and specific adjectives.&#0160; I choose these paragraphs because they directly pertain to theories with which they&#39;re familiar and contain a terminology they recognize from <em>Happier</em>.&#0160; A paragraph might look like this one:</p>

<blockquote>The theoretical model of the present work builds on response shift theory (Schwartz and Sendor 1999; Sprangers and Schwartz 1999; Rapkin and Schwartz 2004), and integrates these other models into a model that focuses on the internal changes that might impact perceived quality of life or health. Response shift refers to the idea that when individuals experience changes in health state, they may change their internal standards, their values or their conceptualization of a target construct, such as quality of life, health, pain, etc. (Sprangers and Schwartz 1999; Schwartz and Sprangers 1999). Response shift theory explains discrepancies between expected and observed levels of perceived quality of life (far right on figure) in physically ill patient populations after health state changes (catalysts of response shift; far left on figure). These changes would directly (i.e., health state changes impair or enhance perceived quality of life) and indirectly impact perceived quality of life (i.e., response shifts moderate or mediate perceived quality of life via stable characteristics or behavioral mechanisms). Stable characteristics of the individual (antecedents), such as personality characteristics, would interact with cognitive or behavioral mechanisms (e.g., altruistic practice, social support) to cope with these health changes, and result in response shifts (Sprangers and Schwartz 1999). Schwartz and Sendor extended response shift theory to describe how engaging in other-directed activities helps one to disengage from prior forms of self-reference and be more open to changes in internal standards, values, and conceptualizations of quality of life (Schwartz and Sendor 1999). Rapkin and Schwartz (2004) extended the Sprangers and Schwartz (1999) response shift model to consider response shift as an epiphenomenon that is inferred when changes in appraisal, which are directly measured, explain the discrepancy between expected and observed perceived quality of life. </blockquote>

<p>From which they might generate a list resembling this one:</p>

<ul>
<li>theoretical</li>
<li>integrates</li>
<li>focuses</li>
<li>impact</li>
<li>conceptualization</li>
<li>target</li>
<li>explains</li>
<li>observed</li>
<li>perceived</li>
<li>directly</li>
<li>indirectly</li>
<li>moderate</li>
<li>mediate</li>

<li>interact</li>
<li>mechanisms</li>
<li>extend</li>
<li>cope</li>
<li>disengage</li>
<li>infer</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ll tab to another paragraph from another of Ben-Shahar&#39;s sources; they&#39;ll rinse and I&#39;ll repeat this four or five more times. Once they start to grumble that they&#39;re seeing the same words over and over again, I have them take out their historical time-line, which is a chronologically ordered bibliography of approximately 50 sources they&#39;ve compiled during their research.&#0160; In later classes, I&#39;ll use this time-line to teach them how to trace the development of an idea through time; right now, I only want it as a resource that they can mine for technical terminology.&#0160; I give them about 10 minutes to go through the titles of the books and articles in their time-line and locate the key terms (&quot;longitudinal well-being,&quot; &quot;differential benefits,&quot; &quot;positive affectivity,&quot; etc.), then I tell them that it&#39;s time to bullshit.</p>

<p>They stare at me, as you might expect, with disbelief, but I assure them that what I want them to do is spend 15 minutes combining their impressive-sounding verbs and adjectives with the key terms from their time-lines into something that sounds like an academic text. </p><p>&quot;What should it be about?&quot; they ask.</p> 

<p>&quot;Anything at all,&quot; I tell them. &quot;So long as it sounds like you know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;</p>

<p>I put one of the sources back on the wall and tell them to look at the sentence structures the author employs, then gently suggest that they should consider using similarly complex ones.&#0160; As they write, I cycle through the sources so as to provide a constant source of inspiration.&#0160; After about 15 minutes, I put them into groups of three or four and have them read their paragraphs aloud to each other.&#0160; Each group then chooses the paragraph that sounds the most academic, and they spend the next 15 minutes collectively working on making that one sound even better.&#0160; They begin giggling, but it&#39;s productive giggling: they&#39;re laughing at how formal their bullshit sounds; at how, even though it means nothing, the arrangement of these words in this manner makes them seem to signify something really, really important.&#0160; They then share their &quot;improved&quot; paragraph with the class.</p>

<p>The giggling turns to laughter as the first two or three groups reads their paragraph, but then their eyes start to glaze over.&#0160; The amusement of impersonation has lost its novelty <em>because</em> <em>their bullshit sounds too much like actual academic prose</em>, and once the novelty values wears off, they respond to it as they would any other academic prose, <em>i.e.</em> by visibly straining to avoid a sudden-onset narcoleptic fit.&#0160; After the final group presents its paragraph, I inform them of their accomplishment.&#0160; They</p>

<ol>
<li>took words whose meaning they already knew,</li>
<li>combined them with technical terminology from the articles they&#39;re using in their essays,</li>
<li>wrote sentences that demonstrate they have a clear understanding of what academic prose sounds like, which </li>
<li>means they know what they need to do to establish a more credible academic ethos; moreover,</li>
<li>if they can use these words and terms they know to write bullshit, they can certainly do the same with the subject of their research, a topic in which they&#39;re acquiring <em>actual academic expertise</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>When they ask—and they will ask—how this is different from plagiarism, I remind them that plagiarism is the theft of people&#39;s ideas (which is why an uncited paraphrase can be plagiarism), but that what they&#39;re doing is using the same active verbs and precise adjectives found in a set of relevant academic articles.&#0160; Using the word &quot;assess&quot; to describe the act of determining the validity of a statistical set simply demonstrates that you speak the same language as your sources. </p><p>When they ask—and they will ask—how this is different from using a thesaurus, I remind them that they&#39;re not sifting through a general reference book for synonyms stripped of nuance, but that they&#39;re using the specific words written by the scholars they&#39;re studying and citing; which, again, demonstrates that they speak the same language as their sources.</p>

<p>Then I tell them to go home, perform this same exercise with one of the sources they discussed in their research proposal, and rewrite the body paragraph they devoted to that source using the list of words they generated from it.&#0160; The result?&#0160; Pedestrian paragraphs that sounded like they were written by students with no confidence are transformed into, if not actual academic prose, at least a passable imitation of it.&#0160; Most of these students know what they&#39;re talking about, after all, they simply lack the vocabulary (and facility with it) required to convince anyone of that.&#0160; When you inform them that what they need is right there in front of their face, they realize there&#39;s no reason to be at a loss for words anymore <em>because they&#39;re all right there</em>.&#0160;&#0160;</p><p>Three years down the line, all they need to remember is that if they study and try to replicate the diction and grammar of their sources.&#0160; It&#39;s not a perfect solution, but it&#39;s better than repeatedly tossing a quarter&#39;s worth of writing instruction down the memory-hole.&#0160; </p>

<p>*The answer, of course, is complex: in the hard sciences, for example, students take writing courses their freshmen year; spend their sophomore and junior in large lecture halls solving equations and filling in bubbles; and are only asked to write analytic essays again in upper-division courses their senior year, by which time they will have forgotten much of what they learned their freshmen. I&#39;m generalizing based on experience here: students whose names I&#39;ve long forgotten will email out of the blue and request remedial writing help because my class was the last one that required they write a sustained work of original research or analysis <em>and now they have to write one for a class they have to ace because this is their major and they&#39;ll never get into graduate school if they don&#39;t</em>.</p>

<p>**One or two of them notices the irony and says something like, &quot;So, we shouldn&#39;t consider someone an authority simply because they have a Ph.D. after their name, and we should trust you because you have a Ph.D. after name?&quot; I tell them I have all quarter to demonstrate my credibility, but that at the very least, you should give people with doctorates the benefit of the doubt until they prove they&#39;ll never earn it.</p>

<p>***The other reason I like teaching this book is that the majority of my students are in the hard or soft sciences, and the study of happiness lends itself to research on psychological and sociological phenomena as well as neurobiological processes, meaning most everyone in the class can familiarize themselves with the databases they&#39;ll be using later in their academic careers.</p>

I have some qualms about this, though: you&#39;ve taught them how to absorb an idiom by teaching them how to abuse it; mastery through parody, you might call it.

<p>That said, though, you&#39;re clearly working the evidence side of the equation pretty hard. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with students writing like students, myself: attempts to imitate academic language that they don&#39;t really understand in order to cover their weaknesses often ends up hurting them more than dealing with the issues directly would.</p></span>

<p>It&#39;s parody in the classroom, but that&#39;s just to 1) build their confidence, by 2) allowing them to demonstrate to themselves that they know what academic prose sounds like.  Once they start revising their own paragraphs, though, they&#39;re borrowing vocabulary and terminology from essays they actually understand.  The lesson may be incomplete, but I&#39;ve only got 10 weeks, so I&#39;m trying to inculcate good instincts as much as anything else.  </p>

<p><em>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with students writing like students, myself: attempts to imitate academic language that they don&#39;t really understand in order to cover their weaknesses often ends up hurting them more than dealing with the issues directly would.</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s why I focus on essays 1) they&#39;ve already read carefully, and 2) use the essays that they&#39;ll have to read carefully as templates.  I don&#39;t want them to imitate blindly: I want them to replicate the successful prose stylings of authors who make what they take to be cogent points.  Even if they misuse the words, they&#39;re still struggling <em>with the material</em>, as opposed to using a thesaurus to create the dread word-jambalaya.  </p>

<p><em>I wish someone had taught me style imitation as a freshman.</em></p>

<p>Me too ... but only if I wasn&#39;t in the humanities.  I mean, given what <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/the_wayback_mac.html" rel="nofollow">actual Honors Thesis</a> ended up sounding like ...</p>

<p><em>Can I steal this lesson for my class?</em></p>

<p>Of course you can, Tom.  I wouldn&#39;t post have posted it if I wanted to keep it a secret.</p></span>

It&#39;s amazing. In fact, No one asked me to write an actual research paper from the eighth grade until I took a graduate level course my senior year.</p>

<p>I actually had to go to the professor of that graduate course and ask how to do basic research. And she was not surprised that I was asking.</p>

<p>All of my english teachers would say things like &quot;everyone else wants you to write research papers, I want to know what <em>you</em> think.&quot; The idea that my thinking should be shaped by research wasn&#39;t really even broached until fairly late in the game.</p></span>

The trouble with learning to be an academic is that there&#39;s this great bundle of stuff that teachers don&#39;t pull apart in any systematic way to aid comprehension. I&#39;m very much in favor of abstracting the formal aspects of writing from the ideas, as one stage in learning how to write.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0128777d16b3970c-content"><p>Wow -- perhaps you might realize a few of us who teach big classes don&#39;t use scantrons. Thursday is my first test in my 350 person soc class. It is all essay. And while I have two GAs to help me proctor the test, I and I alone will be grading it.  And I will get them done by Saturday evening. In EVERY class I teach, there are both only essay tests and major papers. And I teach, on average, 500 students a term. Plus they all have to write 2+ posts to discussion boards every week. So maybe some of us not in English depts do care about writing and would prefer to work with you, rather than being slapped around like the start of this post did. My students in intro soc write more and get graded on their writing more than in their English classes (plus then their soc content). </p>

<p>So hey -- ease up on oh, that big academic writing technique called overgeneralization, will you? Thanks.</p>

<p>Someone who does try to teach writing and therefore just maybe, gets to ask some of these questions about my colleagues in English. </p></span>

I want them to cultivate clarity of thought and clarity of writing, not complexity for the sake of complexity or for the sake of sounding &#39;academic&#39;.  A student who wrote in long, convoluted sentences full of academic buzzwords would get a low grade from me.</p></span>

Troy Nelson will forget this fact by the time I finish this sentence. Noted: Meritocracies are not, as their name strongly suggests, based on merit; they are based on sympathy. Whichever team merits the most sympathy wins the meritocracy, but not necessarily the Super Bowl.Noted: The sympathy on which this meritocracy is based has nothing to do with the teams themselves, nor should it have anything to do with the cities those teams represent. This was undoubtedly not what Troy Nelson believed when this happened, because September 11th happened to all Americans, Katrina only to the black ones. Noted: The players on the New Orleans Saints are external to the game. You might be tempted to claim that, because they participate in it, they are a part of it, but that's only because you're either a socialist or bleeding heart.</span></a></div>
