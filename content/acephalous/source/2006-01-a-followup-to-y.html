You're a miracle, dear boy! If we'd had to invent you, you wouldn't be half as convincing. When I read this confirmation of the perfection of a fictional character for a fictional function I cannot help but think the author has rendered an unlikely situation doubly so.

		<span id="comment-12573594-content"><p>What I found to be strikingly odd about Le Carré&#39;s writing, at least in his early books, was his weird philosemitism.  I mean, it&#39;s better than anti-semitism, don&#39;t get me wrong, but Jews occupy a strange space in his books: they&#39;re all such perfect Others, functioning as representative of the intellectual life that the narrator wishes he had, sacrificial victims to prejudice, or other time-tested roles.  Don&#39;t even start on &quot;The Little Drummer Girl&quot; if this kind of thing bothers you; that one has (as far as my vague memory goes) a Christian woman Giving Her All up as a spy for the Israeli secret service in a sort of compensatory sacrifice motif.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-12585799-content"><p>The &#39;appeal to nonfictional perfection in a fictional narrative&#39; is a very interesting tic, and one I feel to be unworthy of a novelist as generally accomplished as Le Carr-e-acute-can&#39;t-remember-the-html-keypadcode-for-the-letter.  I teach Creative Writing, and it&#39;s one way of separating the most naive from the slightly less naive in the first year seminars:  the former use cliche (clich-seeabove) in an ingenuous way.  The latter recognise the cliche, but instead of thinking of a non-cliched way of putting it they try and defuse their usage with a &#39;if I read this in a novel I wouldn&#39;t believe it!&#39; strategy of sort or another.  It&#39;s a pretty feeble trick, I agree: but then I also think that, actually, it&#39;s the whole cultural logic of Postmodernism &#39;in a nutshell&#39;, as the cliche would put it.  It&#39;s Umberto Eco&#39;s observation that under the logic of postmodernity we can no longer say &#39;I love you&#39;; we have to say &#39;as Barbara Cartland would say, I love you&#39;.</p>

<p>I say this not to knock Pomo, which rules.  Rocks.  Is Cool.  Etc.  It&#39;s more a statement about cultural prior saturation and the inevitable belatedness of &#39;new&#39; cultural production.</p></span>
