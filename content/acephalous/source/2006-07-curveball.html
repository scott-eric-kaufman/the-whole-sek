        <meta name="description" content="[File under Language Log-lite.] The phrase &quot;throw X a curve&quot; means &quot;to surprise someone with something difficult or unexpected.&quot; That definition baffles your average baseball fan. Why would a hitter be surprised if a pitcher featuring a curve in his repetoire throws one? Yet, according to Google: throw * a curve ~89,400 throw * a curveball ~16,700 throw * a curve ball ~25,200 threw * a curve ~50,200 threw * a curveball ~14,200 threw * a curve ball ~17,600 Husbands, wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, sons, daughters ... bosses, employees ... assistant regional managers, assistants to the regional manager ... Mother Nature and Life-with-a-capital-&quot;L&quot; all throw unsuspecting &quot;batters&quot; unexpected curves. You would think, with all these curves being thrown, people would realize that everyone and everything can throw a curve. Then why is it so effective? Because everyone and everything also features hard cheese. (Get a little smug and you'll find some mustard on it.) By baseball logic, that's the only way to be &quot;surprised&quot; by a curve. Note the scare quotes. You're not &quot;surprised&quot; by the curve so much as you have to start your swing early in case you're thrown a good fastball. But a change-up (which looks like a fastball but flies 5-10 m.p.h. slower) would &quot;surprise&quot; you in the exact same way. The &quot;surprise&quot; lies in the speed differential. You cheat on the fastball and anything slower—be it a curve, change-up, slider, knuckler, what-not—will &quot;surprise&quot; you in the very same way. So why is the curve singled out? Why does X always get you with the curve? I'm not qualified to answer that question.

You've been frozen by an eephus: The Eephus is thrown overhand like most pitches, but is characterized by the unusual high arc of its trajectory and its corresponding slow velocity, bearing more resemblance to a slow-pitch softball delivery than to traditional baseball. It is considered a &quot;trick&quot; pitch because in comparison to normal baseball pitches (70 to 100 miles per hour), an Eephus pitch appears to move in slow motion. Hitters typically get very anxious, swing wildly, or ground out. God and everything you imagine exists in His Creation don't throw a curve. They throw an eephus. You weren't looking for it. Didn't expect it. But there it is ... floating erratically, so very seductively ... yet there's nothing you can do. You've already finished swinging.

to Google:</p>

<p>Then why is it so effective?&nbsp; Because everyone and everything also features hard <a href="http://phoenix.about.com/library/blbaseballslang05.htm">cheese</a>.&nbsp; (Get a little smug and you'll find some mustard on it.)&nbsp; By baseball logic, that's the only way to be &quot;surprised&quot; by a curve.&nbsp; Note the scare quotes.&nbsp; You're not &quot;surprised&quot; by the curve so much as you have to start your swing early in case you're thrown a good fastball.&nbsp; But a change-up (which looks like a fastball but flies 5-10 m.p.h. slower) would &quot;surprise&quot; you in the exact same way.&nbsp; The &quot;surprise&quot; lies in the speed differential.&nbsp; You cheat on the fastball and anything slower—be it a curve, change-up, slider, knuckler, what-not—will &quot;surprise&quot; you in the very same way.</p>

<p>So why is the curve singled out?&nbsp; Why does <em>X</em> always get you with the curve?&nbsp; I'm not qualified to answer that question.&nbsp; (I would've been if LSU hadn't dismantled the linguistics department, but then I wouldn't have caught people having sex in my office and never come to your attention.&nbsp; He <em>does </em>work in mysterious ways.)&nbsp; But I insist on commentarying anyway:</p>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/just_humiliatio.html"><span><strong>A Just Humiliation</strong> Earlier today, on a blog with unlinkable comments, I wrote: Never fails. Correct someone’s spelling? Alwasy wtih a coupel fo typso. Praise clarity and precision? Always needlessly verbosely, with neither wit nor style evident in the presentation of the intended declamation, and frequently with errors of a grammatical nature, as evidenced in the previous comment vis-a-vis subject-verb agreement. The same Law of Just Humiliation applies to outbursts of blog triumphalism. Yesterday's post applauded in cluttered, clunky prose the clarifying influence of regular writing on the awkward word-stylings of academics. Terrible, it was, what I wrote, thinking I did so well. When, in truth, I failed in practice of that which I preached, and most egregiously, no less. But, I contend, even in this failure—complete though it be—I learned that on a blog you can only merely ever aspire to champion a cause like clarity, because you cannot revise unless you plan posts weeks in advance. But to do so would defeat the purpose, transfude the daily writing into a daily written chore ... and who among working academics does not already possess hoards of chores they blog to banish momentarily? If I extravagate into distant, anti-triumphal territory tonight, I do so because I lack the means to trochiscate some palliative into an easily digestible form. Would that I were possessiant of a pill expatiative, a curative of such impressive spectrum as to wither all fears and roots. Were that my fears more meloniform, that I could shoot or swat sans purfle and sink or jack them thus from yardland ... ... by which I mean, I'd delve into the OED and make myself feel a little less stupid and pointless by parading my recently acquired vocabulary before all you ignoramuses. You know, all y'all who don't recognize them words I wrote previously immediately. Y'all have to &quot;consult&quot; some dictionary to sensify me? I'm so much more superior. You may as well as go do what I feel like doing but am &quot;cleverly&quot; &quot;disguising&quot; by &quot;insults&quot; I'm sure y'all &quot;take&quot; &quot;to heart.&quot; Doomed, we are, and to terrible things, no less.</span></a></div>
