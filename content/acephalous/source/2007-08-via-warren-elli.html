			<p>Via <a href="http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=4883">Warren Ellis</a>, I learn of <a href="http://abuaardvark.typepad.com/abuaardvark/2004/02/comic_book_poli.html">this request</a>, made three years ago:</p><blockquote><p>I'm going to be teaching a short course at my college next winter
called &quot;Comic Book Politics.&quot;&nbsp; The idea is to have the students read the
best comics published since the mid 1980s which raise—either directly
or indirectly—challenging political issues. I define this pretty
broadly—anything from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563897563/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Authority</em></a> as a way of discussing the ethics
of intervention to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141014083/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Maus</em></a> as a route for discussing the Holocaust.&nbsp; I
can't do things not collected into trades—just too hard to get enough
copies to 15-20 students otherwise.&nbsp; So here's the problem: I only got
back into comics over the last year after not reading them for a decade
or so.&nbsp; I've been doing my best to catch up, but I'm sure that there are
great authors, series, or TPB's that I've missed or else haven't fully
appreciated. Here's a tentative list of what I want to include: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=cerebus&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;index=books&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Cerebus</a></em><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" />, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=transmetropolitan&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;index=books&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Transmetropolitan</a></em><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" />, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0930289234/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Watchmen</em></a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401207928/diesekoschmar-20"><em>V for Vendetta</em></a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563893428/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Dark Knight Returns</em></a>,

<p>Offensive parallels aside, it seems to me that Timothy Burke's &quot;<a href="http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=413">Department of Everything Studies</a>&quot; offers a better model of how to treat literary phenomenon which aren't (or never were) limited to traditional literary media.&nbsp; Consider the example of &quot;noir.&quot;&nbsp; In order to present an accurate account of noir as a cultural phenomenon, you might <em>begin </em>with the novels of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Raymond%20Chandler&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;index=books&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Raymond Chandler</a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" /> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Dashiell%20Hammett%20&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;index=books&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Dashiell Hammett</a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" />, but you'd be remiss if you ignored <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir">film noir</a>, as it was not merely a contemporary phenomenon, but a complementary one.&nbsp; (Many of the early films being adaptations of the novels and/or written by the novelists.)&nbsp; A serious engagement with works which have enlivened noir's conventions would entail airing the first season of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000UX6THK/diesekoschmar-20">Twin Peaks</a> </em>or having the students read Ellis' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1582406936/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Fell</em></a> more than it would reading novels so formulaic they continue to be written long after the men and women who penned them have died.</p>

<p>Granted, the traditional caveats apply: you're unlikely to find a single instructor sensitive enough to the quirks of each medium to teach the course responsibly.&nbsp; I'm sympathetic to this line of criticism, but it requires <em>more </em>of an instructor than the current system does.&nbsp; Example: if I were to teach a course on 19th Century American literature, I'd be duty-bound to include some Melville.&nbsp; As I said, I've <em>read </em>Melville for pleasure since childhood, and with a month's prep time could pass myself off as a middling Melville scholar.&nbsp; There are thousands of people more qualified to teach Melville, but since I'm nominally a 19th Century Americanist, no one would bat an eye if I did.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In an ideal setting, a Melville scholar would teach Melville and I'd glide in to close the century with Wharton, London, and Twain.&nbsp; In an actual classroom, I teach Melville by proxy, on the basis of what I've gleaned from the Melville scholars no university can afford keeping in the wings.&nbsp; I'm not the <em>most </em>sensitive reader of Melville, nor would I be the <em>most </em>sensitive critic of a show like <em>Twin Peaks</em>.&nbsp; But give me a month to immerse myself in the secondary literature, and I'd be sensitive enough to teach it.&nbsp; This isn't to say I don't sympathize with those who bemoan the teaching of works outside the media of their expertise.&nbsp; I merely want to draw attention to the fact that we do something analogous all the time with nary a complaint.</p>

<p>Which brings me back to my original complaint: while some phenomenon which are media-specific, &quot;politics&quot; isn't one of them.&nbsp; Unless you want to teach a course examining the unique contributions to political discourse of funny books <em>as a medium</em>, there's absolutely no need to segregate them from the literary gen pop.<br /> </p>

		<span id="comment-80329227-content"><p>Hmmm... I don&#39;t agree, and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s doing what you say he&#39;s doing. I think it _is_ a course on comic books and how they do things in a specifically comic-bookian way, which the teacher will then relate to politics. But &quot;politics&quot; is here &quot;being defined pretty broadly&quot; --- I would say much more broadly than anything government two-party system blah blah blah, and this expansive definition will allow the teacher to distinguish between what comics intend to do or consciously do, and what sorts of unintentional effects the medium itself might have --- I would agree with the teacher of the course that any genre or medium that claims it is &quot;just entertainment&quot; or &quot;isn&#39;t about politics&quot; warrants careful examination to see what politics, what ideologies, it holds as natural and self-evident.</p>

<p>And limiting to a single form or genre can help clear your time for other things, as students will need to get the handle on your approach and the stylistics in addition to not knowing squat about the historical background you&#39;ll need to teach them, and having to teach how to talk about tv, and novels, and comics, and films, and paintings, and kumquats, all takes up a lot of class time. In my opinion. </p>

<p>That said, I love teaching Everything and if any departments of Everything Studies would want to hire me I&#39;d love to teach a class on Comic Book Bodies. Which, as I would teach it, could be interchangeably titled Comic Book Politics.</p></span>

However, in my defense, I&#39;m <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/department_of_everything_studies_redux_does_medium_trump_period/" rel="nofollow">patently conflicted</a> <em>vis-a-vis</em> this particular issue.  So I may disagree with you presently.  But not now.  Oddly, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any real disagreement here even among me, myself, and you; mostly, it&#39;s an object lesson in what we&#39;d ideally like to be able to do and what we think we can at any given moment.  I&#39;m feeling optimistic tonight, but&#39;ll probably be <em>uber</em>-practical come morning.</p>

<p>That said, the 1) number and 2) content of my posts tonight are indicative of wide-scale grumpiness.  I blame late-Twain, the damnable pessimist.</p></span>

Until you read the comments. &quot;Edmund Burke&quot; opines: If it is produced in the laboratory, it is not a miracle. &quot;Markangelo,&quot; from &quot;Torrance, Amerika,&quot; responds: Why can't &quot;GOD&quot; make a miracle in the laboratory[?] &quot;CK&quot; of &quot;DFW, Texas&quot; answers his question: He did. The Universe that provides the elements that the scientists manipulate to make these wonderful things. Or, did you miss that? &quot;AGS,&quot; from Chicago, attempts to bring some common sense to the proceedings: Please note that &quot;miracle material&quot; is not a theological term implying supernatural origin. It simply indicates unusually outstanding properties and applications that exceed the conventional by a wide mark. He is ignored. &quot;Eric&quot; of Atlanta merely repeats &quot;CK&quot;'s answer to &quot;Markangelo&quot;'s question: He made the silica gel, the carbon dioxide, and the brain of the man that has the arrogance to think he can &quot;make&quot; anything. All glory goes to God. Humanity arrogantly credits itself for His work in the world. To be honest, I hadn't noticed this mode of theistic complaint until it was brought to my attention yesterday. More Twain, again from Letters from Earth: If science exterminates a disease which has been working for God, it is God that gets the credit, and all the pulpits break into grateful advertising-raptures and call attention to how good he is! Yes, he has done it. Perhaps he has waited a thousand years before doing it. That is nothing; the pulpit says he was thinking about it all the time. When exasperated men rise up and sweep away an age-long tyranny and set a nation free, the first thing the delighted pulpit does is to advertise it as God's work, and invite the people to get down on their knees and pour out their thanks to him for it. And the pulpit says with admiring emotion, &quot;Let tyrants understand that the Eye that never sleeps is upon them; and let them remember that the Lord our God will not always be patient, but will loose the whirlwinds of his wrath upon them in his appointed day.&quot; They forget to mention that he is the slowest mover in the universe; that his Eye that never sleeps, might as well, since it takes it a century to see what any other eye would see in a week; that in all history there is not an instance where he thought of a noble deed first, but always thought of it just a little after somebody else had thought of it and done it. He arrives then, and annexes the dividend. For &quot;Eric,&quot; &quot;CK,&quot; and their ilk, nothing is possible without God, therefore all credit ultimately belongs to him. This is why home-runs lead to hosannahs: If God had not blessed a particular athlete with the skills required to hit a home-run, he never would have been able to the swing the bat (whittled from lumber of His stock),...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/on-kc-johnsons-.html"><span><strong>On K.C. Johnson's Durham in Wonderland and Until Proven Innocent</strong> (The second installment can be read here.) With all due apologies to Ralph, Scott, Timothy, Miriam, and the rest of the good folk at Cliopatria, I've got to say: keeping K.C. Johnson on the roster does the rest of the contributors a disservice. He divined the truth of what happened in Durham on the night of March 13th long before the police announced the results of their investigation. He was correct. Those who believed three Duke lacrosse players had raped an African-American women were incorrect. Granted. But I spent an hour this afternoon catching up with Johnson's Durham-in-Wonderland. If the research presented on the blog is indicative of the content of his soon-to-be-published book—Until Proven Innocent: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case—then I can only conclude that the book'll be positively Horowitzian in tenor and substance. Like Horowitz—and clocks twice a day—Johnson occasionally nails his target. Consider his series of profiles of the &quot;Group of 88.&quot; That Wahneema Lubiano is a tenured associate professor in the Program in Literature with one edited volume on her CV and two monograph that've been perpetually forthcoming since 1997 infuriates me. It also infuriates every academic struggling for tenure, so the notion that her position is indicative of a general rot in the academic humanities is willfully misleading. One down, eighty-seven to go. Only he's not going to get to all eighty-seven. He's shutting down the blog when Until Proven Innocent's published in September, and as of August 30th had only written fourteen—and even that's being charitable, since the final three were group profiles. I can imagine the response: &quot;So what? He's found fourteen intellectual frauds in a group of only eighty-eight professors! That's a damning percentage.&quot; It certainly is. Were he a baseball player, he'd be hitting a Ruthian .159. But he isn't even hitting that well. Consider his profile of Joseph Harris, the director of Duke's University Writing Program. He's published three books and numerous articles. His articles are published in the most important journals in the field of composition studies. He has what can only be described as a stellar publication record for someone working in composition and rhetoric. Johnson's dismissive description of the books—&quot;each of which discuss how to teach writing&quot;—is a blatant attempt to minimize the work of the entire field. (A field, I should add, whose lack of respect is often lamented by conservative critics when they bemoan the reading and writing skills of the contemporary college student.) What really galls me about Johnson's profile of Harris is his attempt to mislead his readers into believing statements like the following point to the liberal bias of Duke composition classes: In a 1991 essay, he asserted that composition classes should &quot;teach students to write as critics of their culture,&quot; with &quot;teaching itself as a form of cultural criticism, about classrooms that do not simply reproduce the values of our universities and cultures but that also work to resist and question them.&quot; That's about...</span></a></div>
