that seriously blogging transforms fun into work.&nbsp; I don't think that's
quite right.&nbsp; The thing about studying literature for a living is that
when boiled to the bone it <em>is </em>fun.&nbsp; It doesn't <em>feel </em>like
fun when committees breath down your back and you can't place your
article anywhere . . . but to say that generating interesting and
accurate readings of literature is a fate worse than death would be the
baldest of lies.&nbsp; I'm of the school of future English professors who
believes that we enjoy what we do whenever we don't have to do it. 
Most of us are &quot;literary intellectuals&quot; who would read much of what we
read anyway.&nbsp; We're <a href="http://www.pseudopodium.org/">Ray</a>
with the possibility of tenure.&nbsp; We sometimes forget we love to do what
we do because the gallons swirling around us threaten both to crush and
drown . . . but as soon as we can catch a breath I think we know that
the reason blogging about what we work on brings us pleasure—the reason
why, at the end of the day, I can write something about contemporary
American literature and the canonization of literary theory—is the
simple fact that we love what we do.</p>

<p>(Only not so much right now what with this dissertation hanging over
my head.)&nbsp; In other words: I write this here blog and contribute to the
Valve not because it feels like work but because, as reluctant as I am
to be &quot;creative&quot; nightly, the benefits of doing so <em>far </em>outweigh the burdens.&nbsp; Blogging, after all, reminds me of <em>why I wanted to study literature in the first place</em>.&nbsp; My dissertation, well, it reminds me of my dissertation.&nbsp; (And I <em>don't</em> want to be reminded of that.)</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.posthegemony.org/">Jon</a> <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/a_post_in_two_p.html#comment-13940189">says</a>:
&quot;I often, for instance, write beyond my nominal disciplinary expertise.
And I try at least to write in a format that is relatively accessible,
if only perhaps to those who have a prior interest in the concepts I'm
discussing.&quot;&nbsp; Blogging takes us outside of ourselves and force us to
address a general audience we otherwise wouldn't.&nbsp; That feeling of
freedom to explore fields outside one's expertise and that mode of
engagement which addresses a generally intelligent audience is
something that the average academic rarely experiences . . . and yet
through the power of blog a whole host of people can experience it
together.&nbsp; The more I think about it, the more I agree with those who
think my categories too strict.&nbsp; I think intent and implied audience
the more powerful attractor of academics to blogging than I initially
had. </p>

<p>And with this I draw this overlong comment-post to a close.&nbsp; I <em>still </em>haven't
addressed the &quot;medieval blogging phenonemon&quot; yet.&nbsp; (I do so in passing
to justify the trackback.)&nbsp; But I believe ending on this note
appropriate because—to sully the stable categories I had established
earlier—I will be spending Valentine's Day with The Little
Womedievalist . . .<br />. . . who is currently at UCLA attending the Derek Pearsall lecture on &quot;<a href="http://www.calendar.ucla.edu/event_detail.cfm?MeetingID=103536">Piers Plowman and His Afterlife.</a>&quot;&nbsp; See what I mean about you medievalists and your 'Zoo bonds?&nbsp; They're wicked strong.&nbsp; </p>

		<span id="comment-13984595-content"><p>For the record, not that you implied this--it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t enjoy my work--I do. I find it genuinely interesting, and I&#39;m really passionate about it (much to the bewilderment of those who don&#39;t like to study the Commerce Clause).  That said, I wonder if any lawyer, political scientist, legal academic would consider their reading/writing &quot;fun.&quot; I used to study literature--yes, even if it wasn&#39;t assigned, I would have read it &quot;for fun&quot; anyway.  But I really, really wonder that if I wasn&#39;t a legal academic, I&#39;d just pick up 19th century cases about shipping boats and wheat farmers and how they impact interstate commerce--for fun.  I don&#39;t mean to lampoon my profession, maybe there are freakshows out there who do read this for fun.</p>

<p>That said, don&#39;t you think there&#39;s a difference between smoe of the more fun and the more &quot;work-related&quot; texts you read?  Novels: fun.  Derrida, Lacan, Delueze:  Not as fun? It&#39;s not just a fiction/non-fiction distinction.In my field, general-interest, for the lay reader law books, academic texts from other disciplines: fun, the way history biographies by David McCulloch (sp?) are fun.  But law review articles, cases new and old:  these are &quot;interesting,&quot; but not something you keep on the  nightstand. Right now, The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Luis Zafon is on my nightstand, and all the other law stuff is in this gigantic file box.  I wonder if you keep </p>

<p>Keep on bridge-buildin&#39;.  And keep on loving what you do. I do myself, I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s beach-reading material. </p></span>

Shameless, Whiny, Scumbag Baby Boomer, Sixties-Generation Spoiled Brats . . . Or Possibly Al Qaeda.</strong> [More meta-academic-blogging later. After a long day of responsible grading I needed to lash out. I promise to bring you more questionable categories and half-baked theories about the status and future of academic blogging tomorrow.] The year is . . . some year in Eighties. A tired old man watches a presidential news conference: President: Now it's taken some doing— Old Man: Yeah, some doing. Like repealing the Bill of Rights. President: —but we have arrived. We are at peace— Old Man: Of course we're at peace! We've killed just about everybody who disagrees with us! President: —our children live in a world free of crime— Old Man: Our children live in a damn police state! President: —we are prosperous beyond the dreams of previous generations— Old Man: We're well-paid slaves. WHO WILL STOP ALL THIS. BOOMING Voiceover: My patience is at its end. The time has come. Who booms the end of his patience? Who agrees with the tired old man that peace has been purchased at the cost of thousands of lives overseas and servitude in a police state at home? He does. Examine that page carefully. Look at the artful despair on the face of an aged Jimmy Olsen. Look at the eyes in those center panels—blue and wide on the left and bruised and battered on the right—and tell me that isn't the work of an artist who understands the complex ways contemporary cultural myths resonate with the American public. The graphic novel from which I scanned the above changed the way I thought both about superheroes and cultural mythology. Thinking about the complicated interaction of myth and politics depicted therein forced my fourteen year old brain to consider a picture more realistic than the superheroes-fight-supervillains and larger than vigilante-fights-petty-crime. Sure I could've waited a few years and read Umberto Eco on Superman as defender of property rights and all things status quo. But because of that graphic novel I didn't need to. So needless to say I felt profoundly disturbed when I learned that Frank Miller had nearly finished &quot;a piece of propaganda&quot; in which &quot;Batman kicks Al Qaeda's ass.&quot; The man who aligned Superman with Reagan foreign policy has decided to align Batman with Bush's? (Click on that link even if you don't read comic books. It's about as brilliant a panel-to-panel progression as you're likely to see.) Conservatives danced in the street. But consider their logic: If Batman attacks al Qaeda then Miller must've turned Dennis Miller's corner. He must now believe in the conservative way of life because . . . no liberal would approve of a vigilante going to Afghanistan and finding and fighting Bin Laden. Now I have no idea whether Miller will reverse the symbolism of the above panel and align Batman with The War President and The Global Struggle Against Extremism . . . but isn't it strange that conservatives can't imagine how Miller sending Batman to Afghanistan might constitute a criticism of the current administration? How can...</span></a></div>
