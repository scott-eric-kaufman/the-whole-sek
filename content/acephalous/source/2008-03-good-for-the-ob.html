<p>I&#39;d pronounce this bad-for-Obama. He needed to regain media attention and today had a barbed response to the &quot;CIC threshold&quot; crap and the Obama-as-veep desperation from Clinton&#39;s camp. This could have been widely spread footage of him mocking their weak-ass attempts to slow him up.</p>

<p>Now Spitzer dominates for a news cycle or two while Mississippi hands another chunk of delegates to the party&#39;s actual front-runner.</p></span>

I followed his stint as Attorney General with such excitement because he really went after Wall Street and white-collar crime during the whole Enron-WorldCom-give-the-store-away debacles, so to see him trip himself up in this stupid way is just crushing. </p>

<p>On the other hand, I can&#39;t believe you didn&#39;t highlight <i>this</i> part of the article: they got him on the motherfucking Mann Act! Yes, the 1910 anti &quot;white slavery&quot; law not allowing women to be transported across state lines for immoral purposes is <i>still</i> on the fucking books! Wow. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure this ties into Wharton and Twain somehow but I don&#39;t know if they ever wrote explicitly on white slavery.</p></span>

It has been amended since its Taftian days, and now reads that it is a federal crime to transport people across state lines to perform any sexual act that is itself already illegal.  Sounds like a fairly sane law to me.</p>

<p>Prostitution should itself be legal, regulated, and taxed (and embarrassing: I mean, sex is simply never so good that one should pay for it).  But the Mann Act is not the problem.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/03/i-generally-aga.html"><span><strong>Retract the Humanities: No, I Despise It Despite How Often It's Been Cited</strong> I generally oppose explaining jokes, but when genuinely bright people miss the point, evidence points to me missing the mark. An article in which someone argues that repressed negrophilia motivates the actions of Ben Cameron in The Clansman would be unspeakably stupid. (I thought the caption to the accompanying photograph would've made that plain.) Dixon is admirably frank about his intentions: &quot;The Clansman&quot; is the second book of a series of historical novels planned on the Race Conflict ... [It] develops the true story of the &quot;Ku Klux Klan Conspiracy,&quot; which overturned the Reconstruction regime ... How the young South, led by the reincarnated souls of the Clansmen of Old Scotland, went forth under this cover and against overwhelming odds, daring exile, imprisonment, and a felon's death, and saved the life of a people, forms one of the most dramatic chapters in the history of the Aryan race. Early in the novel, Austin Stoneman presents President Lincoln with the following argument: The life of our party demands that the Negro be given the ballot and made the ruler of the South. This can be done only by the extermination of its landed aristocracy, that their mothers shall not breed another race of traitors ... Nature, at times, blot out whole communities and races that obstruct progress. Such is the political genius of these people that, unless you make the Negro the ruler, the South will yet reconquer the North and undo the work of this war. The Southerners may have been defeated, but their stock is as hale as their minds are sharp. If not put to the Negro's boot, Anderson argues, the South will rise again. He quickly learns the gravity of his error, and by novel's end he entreats the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan thus: My will alone forged the chains of Negro rule ... When I first fell a victim to the wiles of the yellow vampire who kept my house, I dreamed of lifting her to my level. And when I felt myself sinking into the black abyss of animalism, I, whose soul had learned the pathway of the stars and held high converse with the great spirits of the ages— At which point he is interrupted. The plot thickens until Stoneman feels compelled to declare: The Klan!—The Klan! No? Yes! It's true—glory to God, they've saved my boy! The novel ends with the Grand Dragons of six states wiring in election results so favorable Cameron announces That Civilization has been saved, and the South redeemed from shame. THE END In short, The Clansman is so profoundly racist it precludes even the cleverest of scholars from reading against its grain. Any theoretical model allowing for such a reading would be invalidated by its ability to allow for such a reading. Granted, an article claiming Dixon's novel is structured by Cameron's repressed negrophilia should never have been published in the first place. But were one to slip past the gatekeepers, it would be out...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/03/the-mann-act-re.html"><span><strong>The Mann Act? Really?</strong> [I meant to post this on Edge of the American West, but Eric and Ari neglected to give me the admin privileges I so richly deserve, so I'm stuck posting it here.] According to the Wall Street Journal, Governor Spitzer will be charged with violating what is popularly called the Mann Act, but which Congress passed as the White Slave Traffic Act. It was designed to &quot;regulate interstate commerce and foreign commerce by prohibiting the transportation therein for immoral purposes of women and girls, and for other purposes.&quot; That the bill prohibits transportation for &quot;immoral purposes&quot; and &quot;other purposes&quot; is as problematically vague as you suppose. Shortly after its passage, the Virginia Law Review voiced its concern that those phrases grant: the statute such sweeping comprehensiveness as to include every form of conduct contrary to good order. Or as the New York Times put it: GIVES WIDE SCOPE TO WHITE SLAVE LAW _____ Supreme Court Holds That the Act is Not Limited to Com- mercialized Vice. ________ INCLUDES ESCAPADES ALSO The Act not only included escapades, it threatened to criminalize all larks, shenanigans, antics, frolics, capers, flings, and high jinks—at least as practiced by the citizenry. Because the very same ambiguity allowed ideologues in police departments and district attorney offices to prosecute anyone and everyone for anything and everything. The first person arrested under the act, heavy-weight champion Jack Johnson, was charged with consorting with his white wife shortly after defeating &quot;The Great White Hope&quot; in &quot;The Fight of the Century&quot; in what is most certainly a coincidence. (Also coincidental: the judge who presided over Johnson's case was none other than Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who while serving as the commissioner of Major League Baseball, blocked the sale of teams to owners who would integrate their roster.) As H.L. Mencken noted, this expansiveness was a feature, not a bug: It was carried through Congress, over the veto of President Taft, who discerned its extravagance, on the plea that it was needed to put down the traffic in prostitutes; it is enforced today against men who are no more engaged in the traffic in prostitutes than you or I. Naturally enough, the effect of this extension of its purposes, against which its author has publicly protested, has been to make it a truly deadly weapon in the hands of professional Puritans and of denouncers of delinquency even less honest. &quot;Blackmailers of both sexes have arisen,&quot; says Mr. Justice McKenna, &quot;using the terrors of the construction now sanctioned by the [Supreme] Court as a help—indeed, the means—for their brigandage. The result is grave and should give us pause.&quot; Lest you think Mencken's merely grinding another of his innumerable axes, in 1936 the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology comforts its readers with this balm salve: Although many believe the &quot;Mann Act&quot; has become a dead letter through the policy of non-enforcement, a recent statement by J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations, shows that this is not true. He said:...</span></a></div>
