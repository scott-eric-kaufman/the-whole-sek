I believe I speak on behalf of all of the Theory people when I say that I find this post to be both completely offensive and utterly uncalledfor.  We (by which I mean &quot;the Theory people other than me&quot;) have been holding a symposium on Spivak in order to heal all the wounds that ail our troubled Internet community -- and all <i>you</i> can do is compare Theorists to species of a famously extinct bird!  Your genocidal ambitions are obvious enough to even the most casual reader -- and yet here we get the Usual Suspect himself &quot;yucking it up&quot; at this piece of unmitigated hate-speech.</p>

<p>Well, Scott, I&#39;ve just got one thing to say to you: I hope you get a rhizome in your colon.  Maybe then you wouldn&#39;t spew such phallogocentric CRAP!!!</p>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/on_the_origin_o.html"><span><strong>On The Origin of Academic Jargon, Part I</strong> As I read Amardeep's contribution to the Spivak MMTOR (to which I will contribute when time and dissertation committee permit) I had one of those moments. You know the ones: You're walking home from class, grousing under your breath about the &quot;progress&quot; you made on your dissertation yesterday, then suddenly something clicks when you think you hear Karen O screaming something which sounds surprisingly like &quot;ZORK!&quot; Tonight's random confluence comes from a click &quot;overhead&quot; as I read Amardeep's post. I had been thinking about how to reply to Belle Lettre and N. Pepperell's comments on something I wrote in an exaggerated fit of annoyance about the idea of &quot;a useable past.&quot; The unacknowledged cherry atop my conceptual complaint had been the feather-fluffing prose in which these historical distortions declaimed. I thought I'd write a sarcastic &quot;Note to Self&quot; about new regulations limiting the number of unchecked facts OSHA allows one to balance simultaneously on a soap box. I'd outline the regulations in bureaucratic detail and lull the majority of my audience into a stupor . . . so I ranted instead. As my prosopalgic complaints accumulated my prosodic ones dropped from sight. All conceptual headache and no complaints about rhetoric! What was I thinking? This. Such were the thoughts my mind's eye lazily half-scanned as I read Amardeep's post after a day of relentless dissertating . . . then it clicked. Endless thought about the Origin of Species had organized an opinion on academic jargon with little or no intervention from my preoccupied mind! To Be Continued . . .</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/on_fincholars_t.html"><span><strong>On Fincholars &amp; The Frequent Object of Their Discontents</strong> I admit to having been surprised by the initial responses to a post in which I compared myself to a shrill bird angered by the inability of a nut to understand the constructedness of its &quot;essential&quot; characteristics. I felt better after seeing that Amardeep recognized the novelty of the idea: it can works both as a critique and defense of literary jargon depending on the mood you're in. It speaks to the necessary imperfection of thought at any particular historical moment, but only inasmuch as any evolving beast is imperfectly adapted to its environment. There's no value judgment there. Only a simple statement of fact. If a single thought could explain the world in all its complexities, there'd be no need to think anymore. The inability of any particular species of fincholars to crack the nut speaks to the uncrackability of the nut, not the uncrackingability of the fincholar. (Perhaps this is evidence that the same rules apply to gentle self-mockery as to biting sarcasm.) Finally: Holbo could've typed this sentence. He didn't. Because he's sound asleep. At 5 p.m. All those people who harbor the belief he doesn't actually read the works of theory he attacks are absolutely correct. No way he can sleep this much and generate Holbonic posts and read the objects of said posts. (Although he did read a large chunk of this little book today.)</span></a></div>
