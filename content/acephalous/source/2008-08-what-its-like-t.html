<p>I played third base and shortstop.&nbsp; I played them well.&nbsp; I had sure

<p>Then one year my coach wanted me to play center field.&nbsp; Being a team
player, I consented.&nbsp; I'd shagged flies during practice, and was better

<p>I left the dugout and jogged past my teammates.&nbsp; Then I kept jogging until my teammates looked like toy soldiers.</p>



<center><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/28/centerfieldpov03.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/28/centerfieldpov03.jpg" title="Centerfieldpov03" alt="Centerfieldpov03" class="image-full" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a>
</center>

<p>I stood there.&nbsp; I was still playing baseball.&nbsp; Only alone.&nbsp; Three
hundred and ninety feet from home plate.&nbsp; Two hundred feet from anybody
else.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Short screaming or semaphore, I couldn't catch anyone's attention.&nbsp; I was alone.&nbsp; </p>


<p>See home plate in the shot above?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Click on the picture to
enlarge it.&nbsp; See it now?&nbsp; Focus your attention on the tiny white dot
near dead center.&nbsp; There's another to its right.&nbsp; Either will work. 
Zoom in on them.&nbsp; Those tiny dots are twice the size of a man's head.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Now imagine something an eighth that size come shooting from the crowd.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You track the ball.&nbsp; You run intuitive <a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:NePxgrnqxwIJ:www.gpc.edu/%7Emcse/CourseDocs/Math1101Projects/project2DE.doc">quadratic models</a>.&nbsp; You run where you think it will land.&nbsp; You compensate for drag.&nbsp; The wind blows it to the left.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You run intuitive quadratic models.&nbsp; You compensate for drag.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Or the right.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You run intuitive quadratic models.&nbsp; You compensate for drag.</p>

<p>Or further behind you.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You run intuitive quadratic models.&nbsp; You compensate for drag.</p>

<p>You adjust course.&nbsp; You adjust speed.&nbsp; All the while you track the
ball.&nbsp; All the while you calculate.&nbsp; The ball hangs in the air for
seconds.&nbsp; You spend every last one of them calculating.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This is not about reaction.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This is not about moving the quick feet.&nbsp; This is not about catching with sure hands.&nbsp; This is different. <br /> </p>

<p>And you are alone. </p>

<center><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/28/centerfieldlone02.jpg"><img border="0" class="image-full" alt="Centerfieldlone02" title="Centerfieldlone02" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/28/centerfieldlone02.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 334px;" /></a></center>

<p>And everyone is watching you.&nbsp; </p>

<p>All eyes follow your eyes following the ball.&nbsp; You feel them.&nbsp; The
weight of them.&nbsp; They're relying on you to know how wide and fast to
stride.&nbsp; They trust the calculations you've made.&nbsp; They trust in the
ones you will.&nbsp; Sometimes that trust is well-placed.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Sometimes not.</p>

<p>Writing a dissertation is like playing center field:&nbsp; </p>

<p>Your eyes light on something small launched at an incredible
distance.&nbsp; Time slows.&nbsp; You calculate where it will land.&nbsp; You
compensate for drag.&nbsp; You track it as it flies.&nbsp; While sprinting.&nbsp; You
adjust your course.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You are alone.&nbsp; Everyone is watching you.<br /> </p>

<p>Fear overtakes you.&nbsp; You will lose the ball in the lights.&nbsp; You will
lose the ball in the high glare of a slate sky.&nbsp; You will trip.&nbsp; You
will stumble.&nbsp; You will fail.</p>

<p>You compose yourself.&nbsp; While tracking.&nbsp; While sprinting.&nbsp; Your chest hurts.&nbsp; Your legs ache.&nbsp; Then:</p>

<p>The satisfying recoil.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You close your glove around the ball.&nbsp; You gather your wits.&nbsp; You throw the ball back to the infield.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Writing a dissertation is like playing center field with one difference: </p>

<p>No satisfying recoil.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The fear is there.&nbsp; As are the calculations.&nbsp; And the gasping.&nbsp; And
the aching.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes you exhilarate in your own breathless grace. 
Certainly.&nbsp; And sometimes you admire the ball descending its clean
arc.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; But:<br /> </p>

<p>There is no satisfying recoil.&nbsp; There is no salutary smack of ball on leather.&nbsp; Not yet.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You are the <a href="http://www.mansfield.osu.edu/~dshaffer/Shaffer%20Publication%20pdf%27s/Publications/Uncatchable%20Balls%20Paper.pdf">outfielder problem</a>
(Chapman, 1968; Dienes &amp; McLeod, 1993; McBeath, 1990; McLeod &amp;
Dienes, 1993, 1996; Montagne, Laurent, &amp; Durey, 1998; Oudejans,
Michaels, Bakker, &amp; Davids, 1999; Todd, 1981).&nbsp; </p>

<p>You await your solution.&nbsp; But: </p>

<p>You're still playing baseball.&nbsp; You're still having fun.&nbsp; But:<br /> </p>

<p>You are unsolved and you are surly.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I know I am.</p>

I need to talk about disparate political interests uniting under a common banner a la the Republican Party, but because I can’t slip into German I’m hard-pressed to find a verb that adequately accounts for “the processual quality of coming together for pragmatic political reasons.” The word I need is “coalitioning,” but that’s not a word so much as a monstrosity. The root of “coalition” is “coalesce,” i.e. “to cause to grow together, to unite, combine.” Only “coalesce” doesn’t connote the unhardy politics of “coalition” my argument requires. I think I’m stuck re-verbing a previously nouned verb to get my point across. Next thing you know, I’ll be redeconstructionating the phallologodiscursive elementalariness of das Ding and then why haven’t you shot me already yet? Suggestions as to how I might forestall death please?</span></a></div>
