		<span id="comment-28100865-content"><p>This is very true. It&#39;s come home to me, very vividly, in the last few weeks. We are raised now, as it were, with a sense that only full expertise will do. My best piece - thankfully forthcoming soon - took ages and ages to write as it required not only a deep survey of the criticism, but some fairly extensive historical research. * I think it&#39;s a valuable paper - I&#39;m very proud of it. But I am quite sure that I won&#39;t write anything like it again, at least not before tenure. Quick hits only now - there simply is no time for that sort of work. I wrote it during my one year off from classwork / teaching during grad school. It took the entire year + some. </p>

<p>But some of the work that I see from the previous generation - late &quot;theory&quot; era folks - feels like once you have the model, you could just keep churning it out over and over again and on demand. If I would be satisfied with that sort of thing, yes, life would be easier. </p>

<p>(I almost think we&#39;re at a point in certain historical periods (modern, for instance) that there are two tracks - and that, in many cases, the assistant level folks coming out present more impressive looking work than do the associate level people...) There are of course major exceptions. </p>

<p>My own answer, ultimately, will be not to present mediocre &quot;just in time&quot; type work, but rather to narrow the scope of future pieces. To do it well, but less globally. Start - and end - smaller. Know what I mean? </p>

<p>* The dark irony of this is that much of what was most time consuming has been left on the cutting room floor after a couple of revise-and-resubmits.</p></span>

I work by the hour, so I never spend as much time finishing off a project as I&#39;d like to -- the remaining work gets cut off at the point at which someone no longer wants to pay for it, or at the stage where I don&#39;t feel like I should be billing them for it even if they&#39;d pay for it (a form of self-censorship, I suppose).  Part of the contemporary market ethos is an increasing drive towards efficiency / productivity in symbolic work.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t one point of tenure, though, to insulate you from that?  Or by the time you get it, are your habits formed?  I suppose that there is also the hierarchy within tenure of levels of professorship (which I don&#39;t understand) to keep you going.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-28130813-content"><p>I agree with Stephen--who was it who argued that New Criticism was perfect for professors in the post-G.I. Bill era in U.S universities, as they could spin out a detailed close reading in a 50-minute lecture in all the new gen ed courses they were teaching (and teach majors same skill set), while publishing their lectures as &quot;literary critics&quot; rather than mere &quot;source-hunting scholars&quot;?  </p>

<p>Yet I&#39;ve put the same pressures on my scholarship as Scott describes, both during and after the dissertation, which means that I&#39;ve been able to publish side projects that meet my standards b/c the fields they&#39;re in and theories they deal with provided a somewhat manageable but still arduous avenue for more rapidly-developable expertise than Hawthorne studies.  It&#39;s taken me 14 years on the Hawthorne project so far to get me to the point where I feel ready to finish the book--and most of that time was devoted to teaching dozens of courses, many of which I was able to use to broaden my knowledge of multiple periods of American literature, not to mention preparing for the side projects themselves, which are now ready to take almost central stage in the Hawthorne book itself.  So I can&#39;t quite recommend my &quot;career&quot; path, but I would point out that probably 90% of the jobs out there won&#39;t put the pressure to publish quickly on you that you&#39;re chafing against.  Think Paul Lauter&#39;s career if you want a model for preparing yourself for the big time.</p></span>

<blockquote>This is very true.</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a shame you can&#39;t link to comments on Long Sunday, otherwise I&#39;d have linked to things in which I&#39;d argued against this (and you).  You could&#39;ve been vindicated!  </p>

<blockquote>But some of the work that I see from the previous generation - late &quot;theory&quot; era folks - feels like once you have the model, you could just keep churning it out over and over again and on demand.</blockquote>

<p>Then again, so could I!</p>

<p>That said, I do think I&#39;ve come to your way of thinking about the dangers of historicism, especially in a profession which lacks the institutional support required to produce such work.  Ideally, we shouldn&#39;t need to take a year off from our jobs in order to do them, and yet, including you, Stephen, and a couple of my friends, we&#39;ve all had to.  That strikes me as a sign of a profession which doesn&#39;t know what it wants, or knows, but isn&#39;t willing to institute the changes required to accommodate it.</p>

<p>Still, you&#39;re right about limiting the scope of projects in order to get the work done; unfortunately, the people I work with aren&#39;t interested in my dissertation being turned into a book, but a series of publishable articles.  </p>

<p>Rich:</p>

<blockquote>Isn&#39;t one point of tenure, though, to insulate you from that? Or by the time you get it, are your habits formed? I suppose that there is also the hierarchy within tenure of levels of professorship (which I don&#39;t understand) to keep you going.</blockquote>

<p>Someday, someone will explain to me the difference between the levels of professorship, which I&#39;m a little murky on as well.  I think tenure does insulate you from these demands, as the Constructivist&#39;s comment below indicates; and that&#39;s a problem, since the acquisition of tenure relies on being able to produce publishable work, which one can hardly do unless one has tenure.  </p>

<p>Adam:</p>

<p>To this day, my best work is still all about Joyce.  I haven&#39;t produced an Americanist paper half as good.  Like you, I acquired an insane familiarity with one book -- <i>Ulysses</i> -- and its critical history; then I wrote a couple of papers which, to this day, I still think are quite good.</p>

<p>Stephen:</p>

<blockquote>Was there ever really an age prior to the age of theory in which a scholar had to read 70 novels in order to publish an article?</blockquote>

<p>I think there was a time in which having read 70 novels went without question.  You don&#39;t read Cleanth Brooks and wonder whether he&#39;s read <i>all</i> of Faulkner, or Trilling and wonder whether he&#39;s read <i>all</i> of James.  Both obviously have, in part because they were expected to.  Once that expectation disappeared, it opened the door to people reading a single book by an author and saying things like &quot;I don&#39;t read literature anymore, I read literary theory.&quot;  (Which is, as Stephen knows, an direct quote.)</p>

<blockquote>The New Historicism (or &quot;New New Historicism&quot;), with its emphasis upon archival work and breadth of reading in a historical period, is another such effort.</blockquote>

<p>And a much more time-intensive one, since it requires not the mastery of skills -- which, yes, take time to master, but not nearly so long, at least, not to achieve the &quot;mastery&quot; required to do literary studies -- but the reading of Himilayas of research (<i>Phrase of the Week</i>).  One quick example: instead of reading a number of books I should have before writing my current chapter, I did extensive bibliographical research.  That research took me about as much time as it would&#39;ve taken to read any two of the novels I was researching, but what choice do I have?  I can&#39;t read all the novels I should and meet deadlines.  So instead of learning how to be a sound academic, I&#39;m learning how to <i>sound</i> like one through the cunning use of bibliographies.  </p>

<p>Constructivist:</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure who said that, but it sounds like an early, pro-New Critical response to old historicism.  </p>

<p>As for the nature of career path, well, on the one hand it points to the value of canonical literature (as does my Joyce example above), in that it circumscribes the amount of work required to produce new readings.  It&#39;s possible to read everything Hawthorne wrote -- if I&#39;m not mistaken, I&#39;ve read everything except for a stray short story here or there, thanks to a Brook Thomas seminar devoted to him.  But as soon as you step off the smooth and canonical -- that is, as soon as you realize that, in addition to Hawthorne, there are all the people he&#39;s responding to, and all the people they&#39;re responding to, and so on -- as soon as you do that, you&#39;re on the Auerbachian path to producing <i>Mimesis</i>, a grand book which simply couldn&#39;t be written anymore.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-28153812-content"><p>Heh, I&#39;m not trying to produce <i>Mimesis</i>, just trying to do for readings for race and Hawthorne what Colacurcio did for historicism in <i>The Province of Piety</i> (except that I try to address NH&#39;s 1840s-1860s episodically and also discuss later writers whose revisions of Hawthorne reveal something significant about race in their times and also provide a primer to ways of reading race in American literature, so you can see why it&#39;s taken 14 years to get as far as I&#39;ve gotten).  If this is your definition of an impossible book, I&#39;ll do my best to prove you wrong.  (But I&#39;ve chosen a strange way of doing it.  Look how dumb I am:  I combined a teaching Fulbright (4/4 although that translates to something like a 3/2 with the less face time yet greater prep time) with a leave, so I don&#39;t even get the year off to finish the book as I originally planned.)</p>

<p>I think the idea that the new criticism was perfect for the teaching/publication demands of the post-G.I. Bill U.S. academy was a new Americanist critique of new criticism.  Lauter? Pease?  Jay?  Aaarghh, I used to have this stuff at my fingertips.  But yeah, you&#39;re right that the new critics built upon their training by old historicist mentors and probably couldn&#39;t have done what they did without it.</p>

<p>Probably about 50% of the departments who offer the 90% literary positions I mentioned above put research 2nd if not 3rd when it comes down to tenure decisions.  If you don&#39;t mind a teaching load of 3/3 or higher and can find a department that limits preps and students in the process, you&#39;ve got a great first job in today&#39;s market.  But, yeah, if you&#39;re aiming &quot;higher,&quot; then research is job 1, so keep publishing all you can while you have the time as a grad student, b/c I never believed my advisors who said I&#39;d look back on that time with envy, but...!</p>

<p>Loved your update of the New England Primer.  Just keep this blog up long enough to be able to look back on it....</p></span>

<p>I don&#39;t know, Scott.  The above seems tantamount to saying &quot;hey, you don&#39;t read the really famous critics and writers and wonder if they knew their stuff.&quot;  Expectations may or may not have included comprehensive reading lists, but selecting folks as examples who were comprehensive and who we know about today in part because of that comprehensiveness doesn&#39;t seem to me to indicate any historical, historicist continuum, if only because there will be ten times the number of those examples of people who vanished into the folds of history, presumably because their work lacked something - writing acumen, comprehensiveness, whatever.  Really you just seem to be saying that doing really good work takes an awful lot of effort and time, and can be really, really hard.  No surprise there.  </p>

<p>The dirty secret of every discipline is the copious number of mediocre or worse PhD holders who practice in that discipline&#39;s name, and I would suggest that this has vastly more influence on the current pressures than does the introduction of theory.  To be honest, to assume that someone simply picks up a theory and runs with it, and that doing so shortens their work time, seems more an indication of your own interactions with people skimping on their theoretical research and on their thinking through of theoretical issues.  What you&#39;re referring to as theory here, when done right, takes serious time, and page for page it takes far more time than a critical examination of a novel.  Anyway, my point being: it seems unfair to praise historicism based on an anecdotal celebration of its most rigorous and comprehensive adherents and then malign a more theoretical approach based a generalized complaint about its lazier practitioners. </p></span>

<p>I actually think this is one discussion where the theory / Theory distinction is helpful - if it can mean the difference between writing &quot;foundational&quot; works of theory vs. derivative works of theoretically inflected lit crit. Of course, of course, Grammatology took a huge amount of effort. I&#39;m not sure, however, that your run of the mill theory-heavy monograph works the same way. Building the machine, and throwing texts through the machine once it&#39;s built are two very different processes. </p></span>

After expanding 29 into 37, then 43, I teetered on the edge of exhaustion. Now I've condensed 43 into 32 and the light is fading from my eyes. Fortunately, all I need to do is one more edit—longhand, in red, without mercy—and I will be finished with it. For now. I've written an angry, verbose post concerning the conflicting demands of historicism and the dissertation, but I'm placing it in my back pocket for the time being, as I lack proper distance from my frustration to be even remotely objective. In its stead, I present the following passage from Tom Masson's parodic play, The Toilers (1901), in which Henry James lays claim to his greatness: (A HERALD approaches, bearing a combination flagstaff, with the English and American flags waving together, and after him, clad in a costume of pure white, steps HENRY JAMES) SONG OF MYSELF. HENRY JAMES I'm a solemn sight In my robe of white, Which all of you must endure— Though you secretly sigh And wonder why— Because I'm a stylist pure. My sentences long I twist with a strong Right arm that is safe and sure, And commas I cram Where the sense they'll dam, For I am a stylist pure. My plots are dull And unbeautiful— Insomnia they will cure; But the cultured few Say I'm an artist true Because I am a stylist pure. (He trips calmly to right and left, performing a modest and stately skirt dance, and concludes) I'm a stylist pure whom you all endure for the sake of the cultured few, Who hysterically sigh and raise an eye, and exclaim he's an artists ture!&quot; Which, as every one knows who is fond of a pose, is the elegant thing to do. CHORUS For he is a stylist pure Whom all of us must endure, Because of the few, Who are cultured and true, Proclaim it's the thing to do. If you think that is cruel, you should see the tripe Silas Weir Mitchell spouts.</span></a></div>
