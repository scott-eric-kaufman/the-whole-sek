Joan Didion—born on this day in 1934—on the eve of this year’s
Presidential election.&#0160; Not that she found this evasion particularly
shocking: “This was not an unpredictable occurence,” she wrote in
1998’s “<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/699">Clinton Agonistes</a>.”&#0160; “These were not entirely unpredictable developments,” she writes in this month’s <em>New York Review of Books</em>.&#0160;
The baseness of American politics may never surprise her, but the
stupidity of the American electorate rarely fails to.&#0160; The object of
her pithy restatements of talking points is never the political actor
who mouths them (from whom nothing more nor better can be expected).&#0160;
In these moments, the indictment is always of the public too stupid to
recognize the absurdity of issues:</p>
<blockquote><p>We heard repeatedly about “our children,” or “our kids,” who were, as presented, avid consumers of the <em>Nightly News </em>in whose presence sex had never been mentioned and discussions of the presidency were routine. (<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375718907/diesekoschmar-20">Political Fictions</a> </em>233)</p>

“arresting enthusiasm for overlooking the contradictions inherent in
reporting that which only occurs in order to be reported” (<em>Political Fictions </em>30)—but
the fault belongs less to the stewards of democracy and their flacks
for behaving thus than to the public who willingly consumes it.&#0160; We are

methodological commitment to a scrupulous passivity untainted by
thought:</p>
<blockquote><p>The discinclination of Mr. Woodward’s to exert cognitive energy on what he is told reaches critical mass in <em>The Choice</em>,

<p>Didion’s prose here embodies the very principle it defends:
Woodward’s inclusion of irrelevance is proven through the judicious
selection of his most irrelevant sentence.&#0160; No fat need (nor <em>can</em>) be trimmed from its meat.&#0160; This otherwise laudable feature has drawbacks (to more than the <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/this_afternoon_.html">the would-be parodist</a>) apparent when <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/didion.htm">inevitable tragedies occur</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nine months and five days ago, at approximately 9
o’clock on the evening of December 30, 2003, my husband, John Gregory
Dunne, appeared to (or did) experience, at the table where he and I had
just sat down to dinner in the living room of our apartment in New
York, a sudden massive coronary event that caused his death. Our only
child, Quintana, then 37, had been for the previous five nights
unconscious in an intensive-care unit at Beth Israel Medical Center’s
Singer Division, at that time a hospital on East End Avenue (it closed
in August 2004), more commonly known as “Beth Israel North” or “the old
Doctors’ Hospital,” where what had seemed a case of December flu
sufficiently severe to take her to an emergency room on Christmas
morning had exploded into pneumonia and septic shock. This is my
attempt to make sense of the period that followed, weeks and then
months that cut loose any fixed idea I had ever had about death, about
illness, about probability and luck, about good fortune and bad, about
marriage and children and memory, about grief, about the ways in which
people do and do not deal with the fact that life ends, about the
shallowness of sanity, about life itself.</p>
<p>I have been a writer my entire life. As a writer, even as a child,
long before what I wrote began to be published, I developed a sense
that meaning itself was resident in the rhythms of words and sentences
and paragraphs, a technique for withholding whatever it was I thought
or believed behind an increasingly impenetrable polish. The way I write
is who I am, or have become, yet this is a case in which I wish I had
instead of words and their rhythms a cutting room, equipped with an
Avid, a digital editing system on which I could touch a key and
collapse the sequence of time, show you simultaneously all the frames
of memory that come to me now, let you pick the takes, the marginally
different expressions, the variant readings of the same lines. This is
a case in which I need more than words to find the meaning. This is a
case in which I need whatever it is I think or believe to be
penetrable, if only for myself.</p></blockquote>
<p>The key clause there—the moment when her prose betrays itself and
lays its innards bare—speaks to how her daughter and husband’s death
“cut loose any fixed idea [she] ever had.”&#0160; For Didion, fixed ideas are
<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/new_post_by_yt_.html">so much fat to be trimmed</a> and, needless to say, self-butchery is neither clean nor painless.</p><p>(<em><a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/now-as-then-the-same-intractable-questions-were-avoided-and-in-the-end-successfully-evaded/">x-posted</a>.</em>)</p>

Nice analysis.</p>

<p>You point out that Didion&#39;s purpose in writing is to describe the errors in most people&#39;s thinking.  Her intention is to encourage more rigorous thought, more serious self-questioning, refusal to take any too-easily arrived-at position.</p>

<p>So, she says, most people &quot;take at face value&quot; what the McCain camp said publicly about their having performed an &quot;exhaustive vetting&quot; of their vice-presidential candidate.  When they read Didion&#39;s essay, wondering whether what she writes is true, they will begin to question whether they had been wrong after all.  They will realize that &quot;tak[ing] at face value&quot; is only one option among others.  They will ask themselves whether that is the best approach, and they will look for other options, compare, analyze, and choose the best one.</p>

<p>Didion intends to demonstrate her readers&#39; mistake.  But &quot;most people&quot; do not read the New York Review of Books.  It is impossible for her to educate &quot;most people&quot; by means of publishing essays in the NYRB.  Moreover, most people don&#39;t follow the campaign as closely as she needs them to, in order for her theory to make sense.  It&#39;s only the &quot;hi info&quot; people -- who are, again, likely to be NYRB readers -- who even know what she&#39;s talking about.</p>

<p>The reasonable thing to do, everybody knows, is to buy low and sell high.  And that&#39;s what is going on here.  She is shopping &quot;the American people&quot; to &quot;the ideal NYRB reader.&quot;  The idea that the people Didion says she would like to educate are going to be changed by the kind of writing she does -- that is nothing more than pie in the sky.<br />

Will they convince themselves they marketed their wares when the state of the nation was equally bleak? Jonathan Culler of Boston prepares to return home after successfully landing a job at MLA 1974. Or will they admit that the prospects for the current crop of newly-minted doctorates are sufficiently dim that the ban on hiring anyone who deigned to take a position because he liked food and needed shelter should be lifted?</span></a></div>

Entered the program the year Clinton entered the White House and chugged along until he earned a Master's. Buggered off until Bush's inauguration and had his prospectus approved that September. Trekked into the Himalayas and returned the day Obama was elected with two chapters in hand and a plan to finish the dissertation by the first day of The One's second term. How did That Guy do it? What did he do when the three quarters in which he was allowed on a leave of absence ended? Was he independently wealthy and dishing out $4,000 per quarter for years on end? Did he leave the program and reapply every time he wanted to advance his degree some infinitesimal step? (I only ask because I want to know what happens to hypothetical people married to That Guy when That Guy's teaching runs out.)</span></a></div>
