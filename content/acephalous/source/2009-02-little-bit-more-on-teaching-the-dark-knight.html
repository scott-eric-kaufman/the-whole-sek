Students should leave my class knowing that the mechanics of a film or comic reveal the intentions of the mechanic. Am I doing an end-around theoretical objections to authorial intent? I certainly am—because I want to instill in my roomful of future rhetors that they need to pay attention to the effect their prose will have on their audience. I want to slow down the process whereby they make claims, and the best way to do that is to explain the joke. Consider the fundraiser scene in The Dark Knight. I start shortly before the Joker puts the knife to Dawes' throat. Here he is approaching her: It's a medium long shot with a slightly shallow focus. Viewers know who to focus on, but are also given a strong sense of the mise-en-scene. This frame belongs to a fairly long and unbroken tracking shot: Note how the camera moves back more slowly than the Joker moves forward, transforming the medium long into a medium shot: As the camera follows the Joker, the crowd slips off the frame—but we know what the mise-en-scene contains. The camera moves with the Joker until this moment: Now it swings to the left and begins to bring the crowd back into the frame. As the camera pivots the frame momentarily centers on Dawes before returning the Joker. The immediate intent is fairly straightforward: Nolan wants to keep the attention focused on the Joker. Viewers now must gauge how Dawes reacts by how the Joker or the crowd reacts to her reaction. The camera continues moving left until the entire crowd is back in the frame. Note that over the next three frames Nolan will show the crowd assembled behind the Joker in its entirety: For those shots the camera traces a circle around the Joker. The viewer attends to his face because the camera gravitates around him like the Earth around the sun. The camera moves behind Dawes's head and brings them into profile: At this point it begins to describe a circle around her instead of him. The effect is delicate if disorienting. Note that over these three frames Nolan shows the entire crowd behind her in its entirety: We now know who is behind her as well as him. Nolan again uses the profile shot to switch dance partners. The camera now circles the Joker again and again Nolan uses the attention on the Joker to scan the crowd behind him in its entirety: Why all the circling? The first reason is kinetic: a shot and reverse shot combination would have settled the action down by introducing a conversational rhythm. The second reason is temporal: once a director starts reversing shots the audience begins to experience time as a function of narrative. The first person says their say. The second person says their say. The first person responds. The second responds. I should note that this is a natural reaction..." />

<p>Here he is approaching her:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168692ee3970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4539942" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011168692ee3970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168692ee3970c-320wi" style="width: 321px; height: 180px;" /></a>
 </div>
<p>It&#39;s a <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48043">medium long shot</a> with a slightly <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#38599">shallow focus</a>. &#0160; Viewers know who to focus on, but are also given a strong sense of the <em><a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/mise-en-scene.htm#43394">mise-en-scene</a></em>.&#0160; This frame belongs to a fairly long and unbroken tracking shot:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011278dea4d828a4-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4539958" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011278dea4d828a4 " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011278dea4d828a4-320wi" style="width: 320px; height: 180px;" /></a>
 </div>
<p>Note how the camera moves back more slowly than the Joker moves forward, transforming the medium long into a medium shot:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0111686934af970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4539966" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0111686934af970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0111686934af970c-320wi" /></a> </div>
<p>As the camera follows the Joker, the crowd slips off the frame—but we know what the <em>mise-en-scene </em>contains.&#0160; The camera moves with the Joker until this moment:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0111686935ec970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540001" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0111686935ec970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0111686935ec970c-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<p>Now it swings to the left and begins to bring the crowd back into the frame.&#0160; As the camera pivots the frame momentarily centers on Dawes before returning the Joker.&#0160; The immediate intent is fairly straightforward: Nolan wants to keep the attention focused on the Joker.&#0160; Viewers now must gauge how Dawes reacts by how the Joker or the crowd reacts to her reaction.&#0160; </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693608970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540010" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693608970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693608970c-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<p>The camera continues moving left until the entire crowd is back in the frame.&#0160; Note that over the next three frames Nolan will show the crowd assembled behind the Joker in its entirety:&#0160; </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693672970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540015" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693672970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693672970c-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01116869368d970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540019" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01116869368d970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01116869368d970c-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011278dea77f28a4-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540024" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011278dea77f28a4 " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011278dea77f28a4-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<p>For those shots the camera traces a circle around the Joker.&#0160; The viewer attends to his face because the camera gravitates around him like the Earth around the sun.&#0160; The camera moves behind Dawes&#39;s head and brings them into profile:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693728970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540043" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693728970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693728970c-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<p>At this point it begins to describe a circle around her instead of him.&#0160; The effect is delicate if disorienting.&#0160; Note that over these three frames Nolan shows the entire crowd behind her in its entirety:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693756970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540059" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693756970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693756970c-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01116869379d970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540067" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01116869379d970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01116869379d970c-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0111686937f7970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540071" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0111686937f7970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0111686937f7970c-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<p>We now know who is behind her as well as him.&#0160; Nolan again uses the profile shot to switch dance partners.&#0160; The camera now circles the Joker again and again Nolan uses the attention on the Joker to scan the crowd behind him in its entirety:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693847970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540087" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693847970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693847970c-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011278dea9a828a4-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540107" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011278dea9a828a4 " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011278dea9a828a4-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0111686938dd970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540112" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0111686938dd970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0111686938dd970c-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693935970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540117" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693935970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168693935970c-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<p>Why all the circling?&#0160; The first reason is kinetic: a <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#51531">shot and reverse shot combination</a> would have settled the action down by introducing a conversational rhythm.&#0160; </p>
<p>The second reason is temporal: once a director starts reversing shots the audience begins to experience time as a function of narrative.&#0160; The first person says their say.&#0160; The second person says their say.&#0160; The first person responds.&#0160; The second responds.&#0160; I should note that this is a natural reaction only because it has been naturalized by film convention in a way that the tracking shot hasn&#39;t.&#0160; </p>
<p>With tracking shots the narrative is subordinate to the frame.&#0160; A tracking shot is conspicuous because it constantly reminds the viewer that what they see is mediated.&#0160; Consider the opening of <em>The Player </em>or almost every Scorsese film: people pass through the frame as the camera moves around them.&#0160; The audience is contantly reminded that it is an audience.&#0160; Nolan attempts to avoid this by creating a conversational pattern to the circle he describes—the purpose of the dance is to replace the harsh cuts of the reverse shot with a more graceful exchange of the faces in the frame.&#0160; </p>
<p>As my emphasis on the crowd in these shots likely indicated, the third reason Nolan circled around them for so long is because the punchline requires him to.&#0160; For the joke to work the audience must be reminded of who is and who is not in the crowd.&#0160; The only way to do that is to show the crowd.&#0160; Note that he started with the crowd behind the Joker, then to the one behind Dawes, then back to the one behind the Joker.&#0160; Now the camera settles into sequential reverse shots.&#0160; For the sake of space I&#39;ll skip over the first few.&#0160; They cover the beginning and middle of the Joker&#39;s story about his scars.&#0160; Now note how tight the composition is when the camera turns to Dawes:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168695a36970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540462" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011168695a36970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168695a36970c-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<p>And compare it to how loosely the composition frames the Joker:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168695af2970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540497" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011168695af2970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168695af2970c-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<p>The frame provides no information about who is in the crowd behind her, but quite a bit about who&#39;s behind him.&#0160; As the story nears its conclusion the camera tightens into a close up. </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011278ded1e628a4-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540587" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011278ded1e628a4 " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011278ded1e628a4-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<p>The Joker delivers his punchline: &quot;Now I&#39;m always smiling.&quot;&#0160; Dawes promptly knees him in the balls:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011278ded47228a4-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540603" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011278ded47228a4 " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011278ded47228a4-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<p>The viewer can see behind him, and because he&#39;s looking right at Dawes, the Joker can therefore see everything behind her.&#0160; Now the Joker plays the straight man.&#0160; He says: &quot;You have a little fight in you.&#0160; I like that.&quot;&#0160; </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011278ded55228a4-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540669" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011278ded55228a4 " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011278ded55228a4-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<p>An off-camera Batman bat-growls: &quot;Then you&#39;re going to love me.&quot;&#0160; Then:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0111686960c8970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-4540674" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0111686960c8970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0111686960c8970c-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
<p>Is it just me or is there no Batman in that shot?&#0160; How about we zoom in on that frame?</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168696322970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Momentone" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011168696322970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168696322970c-320wi" /></a>
 <br />
<div style="text-align: left;">I see no Batman.&#0160; What about the next frame?<br />
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168696367970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Momenttwo" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011168696367970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168696367970c-320wi" /></a>
 </div>
Batman!&#0160; But remember what I said about the Joker looking right at Dawes not but two seconds ago?&#0160; How exactly did Batman come to occupy the area immediately in front of the Joker without the Joker noticing?&#0160; And why does the Joker look to his left when Batman is in directly front of him?*&#0160; Did the Batman tiptoe through the crowd?&#0160; Why didn&#39;t the crowd react to Batman inching his way next Dawes?&#0160; The answer to all these questions is that Nolan threw realism out the window here.&#0160; <br /><br />All that circling wasn&#39;t intended to show the audience who was in the <em>mise-en-scene</em>—it was intended to show them who wasn&#39;t.&#0160; In retrospect those tracking shots read: &quot;No Batman no Batman no Batman no Batman no Batman.&quot;&#0160; Then Batman appears not where we expect him—that would be the crowd behind Dawes, as Nolan only showed viewers them once, then deliberately kept them off-frame when he went to reverse shots—but where <em>he cannot possibly be</em>: immediately to the left of Rachel, right in the Joker&#39;s line of sight.&#0160; Why does Nolan do all this?&#0160; In service of what profound thesis have I wasted all these words?&#0160; <br /><br /><strong>The Batman is really fast.</strong><br /><br />If this is what&#39;s required to demonstrate the obvious, imagine what it takes to prove something legitimately complex.<br />

<hr />
<span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: Georgia;">*In a blog post one of my students offered the following explanation: &quot;Would it benefit the Batman to learn how to throw his voice?&#0160; It would.&#0160; Q.E.D.&quot;**</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: Georgia;">**I do so rue the day I taught them what &quot;Q.E.D.&quot; meant.&#0160; I can&#39;t count how many times I&#39;ve had to Q.N.E.D. a student&#39;s Q.E.D. at this point.</span></div>

<p>It&#39;s interesting how Nolan uses a really high key light, almost overhead, to help turn the Joker&#39;s eyes into pits (the black makeup is not in and of itself enough, as we can see from that shot of the Joker with his head tilted back a bit). To do that he had to risk Maggie Gyllenhal really not looking attractive (even ignoring the bad hairdo and scarily gaunt ribs poking through where there should be cleavage). </p></span>

		<span id="comment-148769891-content"><p>But Andrew, then I&#39;d have to spend the quarter teaching dreck produced by no-talent hacks.  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d enjoy that too much.</p>

<p>Thanks, todd.!  Are you an institute of higher learning, and if so, you don&#39;t happen to be hiring, do you?</p>

<p>Sisyphus, I love the fact that, objectively, there should be cleavage.  The lack!  The lack!  And what&#39;s odd is that Gyllenhal was criticized for breast-feeding her kid on the set.  (Or so I half-remember from one of her <em>Daily Show</em> appearances.)  I didn&#39;t focus on the lighting here, but throughout the film Nolan uses really high key lights: he lines the the righthand side of the bank in the opening scene with a on-screen explanation of them, then reuses them in <a href="http://storageinsider.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/batcave-dark-knight.jpg" rel="nofollow">the bat-cave</a>.  They&#39;re in Bruce&#39;s penthouse too.  Honestly, he&#39;s a little obsessed with putting in-frame lights that&#39;ll plausibly create the effects he desires.  (He did it in <em>The Prestige</em> too.)</p>

<p>As for whether todd. would enjoy my composition course if it were a literature course, I&#39;ll say this: one of the reasons I&#39;ve written these posts is that, unlike when I teach literature, I don&#39;t have a ready-to-hand toolbox for discussing film or comics, so I&#39;ve had to build one.  But I consider what I&#39;m doing here a close-reading akin to what I&#39;d do to a work of literature were I happen to be teaching <em>Huck Finn</em>.  The historical audience and rhetorical devices would be different, but the process would be the same: how does this work, what does it tell us about the author&#39;s expectations of the reader, &amp;c.  </p></span>

Started with <em>Looking Backward</em>, on to <em>The Iron Heel</em> and <em>Sister Carrie</em>, threw in some Silas Weir Mitchell and Thomas Dixon, &amp;c.  I think most classes on American realism and naturalism end up like that.</p>

<p>That said, my inner-intellectual historian thinks popularity should matter when we talk about particular cultural moments, but disciplinary history dictates we teach works which model complexity, and rarely do those twain meet.  (Like, in Twain.)</p>

<p>JPool:</p>

<p><em>Are your students making films/comic books as part of the course, so that they can try out these various visual devices and see if/how they work for them?</em></p>

<p>They do.  Their first assignment is the R.A. (or rhetorical analysis), their second the unfortunately acronymed R.I.P. (or rhetoric in practice).  They write their own comic, script, review, &amp;c., the thinking being that the lessons will stick better if they apply the techniques they&#39;ve learned to identify.<br />

<p>He sure is! I like how with all that heavy gear and large cape he is able to silently disappear from people mid-conversation.

<p>But, as Q.E.D.&#39;d above, it&#39;s a realism whose tenets are continually violated.  I mean, he falls 90 some-odd stories, lands on his back and walks away in the first half of the film; but at the end, he&#39;s nearly killed by a three-story drop?  Say what?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the real problem with my analysis here, isn&#39;t it?  I don&#39;t account for the score---how Nolan titters on the edge of key with his harem of shrieking cellos.</p></span>

I've done my damnedest to reconstruct the history of Dublin from Ulysses of humans, human-looking robots, robot-looking robots and Cylons on Battlestar Galactica. The dates are purposely vague: I'm more interested in the order in which events occurred than precisely dating them. 5,000ish years ago: Humans inhabit Earth. They leave. Stop at the Algae Planet and build the Temple of Athena so future people can find their way back. Keep on moving and settle on Kobol. 4,000ish years ago: The residents of Kobol create a race of robot slaves that look exactly like humans, i.e. in their own image. These robots can resurrect but not reproduce. Some sort of Blade Runner-scenario maybe ensues? Can't tell but could be important. Either way, the monotheistic Thirteenth Tribe of human-looking robots leaves Kobol and—in Ellen Tigh's words—backtracks to Earth. They stop on the Algae Planet to find the way to Earth. They re-colonize it. 3,500ish years ago: But they are lazy. So the human-looking robots on Earth build robot slaves who look like proper robots. No chance of a Blade Runner-scenario there. Their slaves look like robots. By this point the human-looking robots have acquired the ability to reproduce sexually and do so for so long they eventually forget how to resurrect. 2,000ish years ago (on Earth): The human-looking robots we know as Ellen and Saul Tigh, Galen Tyrol, Samuel Anders and Tory Foster (henceforth &quot;Ellen and the Gang&quot;) are born and become scientists. They are warned that their robot slaves plan to destroy them. They rediscover resurrection technology and put a resurrection ship in orbit. The human-looking robots and their robot-looking slaves mutually assure their own destruction—except for Ellen and the Gang, whose brains are downloaded up to their new bodies on the resurrection ship. 2,000ish years ago (on Kobol): Something happens. The Twelve Tribes of humans leave Kobol and settle on twelve loosely-affiliated planets. Each of the Twelve Colonies develops an individual mono-planetary culture because that is what happens in science fiction. Between 2,000ish years ago and 53 years ago (in Twelve Colonies): Mono-planetary cultures notwithstanding, humans become lazy again. Like the human-looking robots of the Thirteenth Tribe, these humans learned from their mistakes and did not make their new robot slaves in their image. They made Toasters. The Toasters rebelled. The Twelve Colonies unite under the Articles of Colonization. Between 2,000ish years ago and 53 years ago (on their way from Earth to the Twelve Colonies): Ellen and the Gang move at sub-light speed. Time dialates. Approximately 53 to 40 years ago: The Toasters and the Twelve Colonies fight a war. On the Toasters' home planet—wherever that is—they try and develop their own human-looking robots. These are the hybrids who control their ships. Ellen and the Gang finally reach the Twelve Colonies. They convince the Toasters to end the war with the humans by promising to help them create human-looking robots. Between 40 years ago and the Miniseries: Ellen and the Gang are true to their word. The first...</span></a></div>

It infuriates her that Obama wants the White House to install a smart podium: Obama is looking to install a computer screen into the podium so that, according to one Obama advisor, “It would make it easier for the comms guys to pass along information without being obvious about it.” Obama’s aids would put together answers to a large number of possible questions so as soon as a reporter asks a particular question the computer screen would flash talking points to remind Obama how he’s supposed to respond to that question. Why would a President—especially an ostensibly intellectual one—want aides to feed facts and figures to his podium on the sly? Are we witnessing the first step down that slippery slope? I think not. Consider: That is a picture of the actual classroom in which I teach my 8 a.m. class. Notice the podium hulking in the corner? It is made of computers. Know what happens when a student stumps me with a question? I confab with it computers so that I provide the student with an accurate answer. This is not to say that I come to class unprepared. I have done my homework. I come armed with my notes. But sometimes a student still manages to stop me in my tracks. Consider a conversation from this morning: Me: It seems like Nolan shot this with the aid of a steadicam. Student: You mean “with a steadicam.” Me: No, a steadicam is something you attach to a camera. Student: My father works in Hollywood and were he here all anyone in this building would be able to hear was him laughing because you are dumb. At which point I stopped the lecture. Walked to the podium. Searched the internet. Brought up that link. Took me about thirty seconds total—which means that for thirty seconds my class consisted of my students watching me search the internet. You know what would have been nice? If I had a staffer whose job it was to do these searches for me so that the results might appear instantly on my podium computer. I would waste less time and be more accurate. (For the record: I was not out to humiliate the student. I teach them that the cardinal sin of the Age of Information is the easily correctable factual error. The above is an example of me practicing what I preach.) But Rosh and her commenters will have none of it. Their beloved Limbaugh employs a staff to feed him information during his show—but he is not a President. The President is a man who should want for nothing. The man who is President needs a lot. He “needs a cheat sheet.” (As did I on my qualifying exams.) He “needs help in just speaking.” (As did I on my qualifying exams.) He “is our first Affirmative Action President [because] he needs extra...</span></a></div>
