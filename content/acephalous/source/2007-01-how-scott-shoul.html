<p>Surely nothing <i>too</i> terrible.  I should add: one way I overcome writer&#39;s block is to switch mediums, as you recommended.  About half of my material originates in emails I send to myself, since that&#39;s a format in which I can be rambling and disorganized.</p></span>

<p>I rarely write emails to myself. I often write longish emails to people I know as a way of thinking &quot;out loud.&quot; I don&#39;t expect them to reply at comparable length. Often enough, they don&#39;t reply at all, and that&#39;s OK. But I do find addressing myself to some specific person whom I know is very helpful. Even when I&#39;m just thinking without any specific notion of getting those thoughts in written form, I address myself to someone I know, though not necessarily someone I know well.</p></span>

I'm editing, re-editing and re-re-editing this week, so I have every reason to be. How else should I feel when facing: The awkward phrasing of the words intended to bring to the reader greater clarity through painful specificity. The lapses in register, from arid pedantry to way too fucking casual, often in a single sentence. The vocabular nonsense—the nouned verbs, the verbed nouns, the inexplicable revival of the Latin gerundive—any sufficiently detailed technical description requires. The vocabularian nonsense any insufficiently secure writer configurates to impress the easily impressed. And those only speaks to the prose. There is still the argument, burdened by: The claims so laughably overbroad only an idiot would believe them. The claims so laughably overboard only an idiot would believe them. Those passages only the writer can understand. Those passages not even the writer can understand. An unseemly penchant for parallel structures which, when coupled with the aforementioned vocabular and vocabularian nonsense, encourages the creation of inscrutable hypocorisms like &quot;Pally.&quot; As I said, I have every reason to be annoyed with myself. (After those bullets, you do too.) But that's not why I'm annoyed right now. No, right now I'm annoyed by the way in which my annoyance radiates, how it establishes a Zone of Irritation from which nothing can escape. Beards, they can not escape it. Lettuce, it wilts. Other people's work? You must be kidding me. Take this claim, from an otherwise impressive book: Many domestic novels open at physical thresholds—such as windows or doorways—to problematize the the relation between interiors and exteriors. (43) How many? The author discusses three, but looking through my shelf of roughly contemporary novels, I can find no others. Not a one. The nature of the claim-structure is backwards here: I believe X, and &quot;many&quot; cherry-picked novels begin by thematizing it. This is the academic variation of the classic Sportscenter statistic: &quot;On the second and third Wednesdays in March, Bobby Knight-coached teams have only lost to unranked opponents twice in the five years he's coached at Texas Tech.&quot; Only it's worse. The Sportscenter infographic remains faithful to its obscenely specific raison d'être, whereas the academic cousin hides its Wednesdays-in-Marchness behind a facade of general truth. The &quot;many&quot; employed in this passage obscures the fact that many, many more domestic novels don't open at physical thresholds. It also conceals the reason why many domestic novels would do so: they're domestic. We should expect thresholds and windows to appear frequently for the same reason we expect spaceships to make regular appearances in space operas. Why even make the claim? Why not focus on how often tables or children appear instead? Notice, too, the implication that the physical location where a novel begins is significant. Should the critic not establish that where a novel opens is more important than, say, where it closes? How could anyone even write this sentence? Isn't the dishonesty of the claim evident to anyone involved in any stage of the writing process? What about all those...</span></a></div>
