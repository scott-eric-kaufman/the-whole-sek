        <meta name="description" content="To all my readers and friends in Baton Rouge tonight, good luck. And stop reading my friggin' blog and start taping your friggin' windows, filling every available container with fresh water, locating your stash of canned green beans and collard greens (and something to open them with), and nailing everything you want ruined (but not lost) onto something stable. Like a concrete patio. In Houston. Good luck to you and yours. (Before anyone says anything, I agree that most of the time the weather isn't news. When it resembles The Day After Tomorrow, however, it's news.) Shades of Galveston dance their frightening dance in my head tonight. I shouldn't say that because Aaron Brown's on CNN saying that &quot;by this time tomorrow we might be looking at Louisiana, at New Orleans, and shaking our heads saying 'Yesterday there was a city there.'&quot; How's that for a cheery, chipper thought? I have many Hurricane Andrew stories, however, and most of them involve stupid adolescent antics in the midst of one of the most dangerous hurricane of the 20th Century. So I have hope that all those I know, love and will be angry beyond the telling of it if they don't evacuate will look around in a week and have humorous flying projectile stories of the same sort I have. (But will they involve Lemonheads like bullets or will they be mundane tales of human survival in the face of natural disaster? Pray for Lemonheads, gentle reader, pray for Lemonheads.) EDIT: There's no reason to panic. Really. From the National Weather Service: AT LEAST ONE HALF OF WELL CONSTRUCTED HOMES WILL HAVE ROOF AND WALL FAILURE. ALL GABLED ROOFS WILL FAIL...LEAVING THOSE HOMES SEVERELY DAMAGED OR DESTROYED. THE MAJORITY OF INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS WILL BECOME NON FUNCTIONAL. PARTIAL TO COMPLETE WALL AND ROOF FAILURE IS EXPECTED. MANY WOOD FRAMED LOW RISING APARTMENT BUILDINGS WILL BE DESTROYED. CONCRETE BLOCK LOW RISE APARTMENTS WILL SUSTAIN MAJOR DAMAGE...INCLUDING SOME WALL AND ROOF FAILURE. HIGH RISE OFFICE AND APARTMENT BUILDINGS WILL SWAY DANGEROUSLY...A FEW POSSIBLY TO THE POINT OF TOTAL COLLAPSE. MANY WINDOWS WILL BLOW OUT. AIRBORNE DEBRIS WILL BE WIDESPREAD...AND MAY INCLUDE HEAVY ITEMS SUCH AS HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES AND EVEN LIGHT VEHICLES. SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES AND LIGHT TRUCKS WILL BE MOVED. THE BLOWN DEBRIS WILL CREATE ADDITIONAL DESTRUCTION. PERSONS...PETS...AND LIVESTOCK EXPOSED TO THE WINDS WILL FACE CERTAIN DEATH IF STRUCK. POWER OUTAGES MAY LAST FOR WEEKS...AS MANY POWER POLES WILL BE DOWN AND TRANSFORMERS DESTROYED. WATER SHORTAGES WILL MAKE HUMAN SUFFERING INCREDIBLE BY MODERN STANDARDS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF NATIVE TREES WILL BE SNAPPED OR UPROOTED. ONLY THE HEARTIEST WILL REMAIN STANDING...BUT BE TOTALLY DEFOLIATED." />

I&#39;ve spent the night calling all my friends and convincing them to relocate from New Orleans and Baton Rouge to my parents&#39; house in Northern Houston.  I think I&#39;ve sent about 15 people to my parents&#39; house.  I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t mind...they&#39;re good people.  I hate to say this, but sacrifice the city, so long as all my friends survive.</p></span>

I noticed that there is a lot of flimsily built housing right in DT and the pictures look very bad already, even though there is talk of a slight veering and the levees haven&#39;t yet broken.  New Orleans is important, the only place in the South where religion doesn&#39;t ruin everything IMHO.</p></span>
