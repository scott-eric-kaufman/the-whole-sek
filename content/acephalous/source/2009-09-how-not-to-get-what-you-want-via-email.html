What&#39;s a kill file?  It couldn&#39;t possibly be as sinister as it sounds, could it?  Could it?!?<br />
Why would you bet apples against oranges?  Is it because you see oranges as inherently more valuable?  This time of year, I would think that apples would be of better quality, assuming a basic enjoyment of each fruit.  Or is this just a mixed metaphor, which, as my mother would say, I have a bat&#39;s chance in hell of understanding?</p>

<p>Also, I believe that the first passage was making reference to the Kampuchean Lying Weasel, which are often kept as domestic animals for their good temper and willingness to &quot;do favors&quot;, through the dispatch of vermin, for their hosts.  It is traditional to insult these weasels while requesting said favors of them, so that malevolent spirits should be misdirected away from them.  Providing contact information is very roughly analagous to the dispatch of vermin, so I think we must assume a similar cultural setting for the above exchange.</p></span>

Oddly, not a day later, I ran across a review of an <a href="http://histsociety.blogspot.com/2009/08/of-voles-and-men.html" rel="nofollow">ambitious (but wrongheaded, I think) scholarly work that had parallels to his argument</a> (you <i>might</i> find it interesting, Scott, because it parallels ecological and historical analysis), and forwarded it to him. He told me in rather sharp terms that he had no interest in reading something by someone as closeminded and wrongheaded as I, and I pointed out that it wasn&#39;t by me at all but might be of interest to him, because that&#39;s what scholars do. No further correspondence ensued.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that most people outside of academia (or many inside, for that matter) really understand the principle of productive disagreement.</p></span>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t know it from how I behave around these parts (I&#39;m off the clock, folks!), but my syllabuses always say that I&#39;m going to teach them how &quot;to engage in academic disagreements professionally and graciously.&quot;</p>

Yeah, who would do a thing like that. That Jeff G., what a maroon.</p>

<p>The request was made, your response was a bunch of rude and verbose crapola, he responded to the latter as one would expect, and now you have rewritten history with everything between the first and the last events excised, and the order of those reversed.</p>

<p>Let me rephrase my original question: Why did you not simply reply, &quot;I don&#39;t know the e-mail address&quot; or &quot;I know the e-mail address but I don&#39;t feel like telling you because I don&#39;t like you?&quot;  Why the cloud of squid ink?</p>

<p>You had the same problem when you reached your conclusion that Cashill was essentially citing himself for affirmation. It was in support of your dismissal of Andersen&#39;s book, remember? The problem was, and is, ambiguous, selective, even false presentation of times and sources of quotations. </p>

<p>Starting with a desired conclusion, and then selecting and massaging facts into supporting it, is not a respectable thing to do. </p>

<p>I would say that your desired conclusion is that Obama is an admirable man doing admirable things, and that people who do not admire what he is doing are nefarious, not to mention stupid; yes, let&#39;s not forget stupid.  If you could have reached that conclusion honestly, you would have done so. Your gaming makes me curious to read Andersen&#39;s book. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what&#39;s odd and valuable about places like <em>Unfogged</em>, where not everyone&#39;s an academic, but somehow the tone remains mostly elevated. Places like that are a surprise for the reason you identify: most people are utterly incapable of calibrating the stakes of a given
argument to the tone in which it&#39;s being received or delivered. </p></span>

Cashill seems to assume that Andersen has some additional, anonymous, source, but since when would that be reliable evidence?  So Cashill is lying by omission to puff up his shoddy argument, while Andersen is publishing unverifyable -- and hency unfalsifiable -- insinuation.</p>

<p>The whole Jeff-Scott conflict, though, is precisely why I comment on blogs but refuse to start my own.  Let&#39;s not pretend that Jeff hasn&#39;t acted like a douchebag to Scott from the very start of this exchange.  And then to come along and say, &quot;Hey old buddy old pal, you&#39;re a douchebag, but you could be useful to me if you gave me an email address,&quot; well, that&#39;s just plain old fashioned fuckery.  That Jeff publishes personal email exchanges is also complete dick-headedness.  That Jeff erases people&#39;s comments to his blog is further fuckery.  I don&#39;t think Scott is under any pressure to do anything more than call Jeff a cocksucker.  That Scott won&#39;t do so is proof that he&#39;s a better man than I.  </p></span>

<p><em>Can you name one of SEK&#39;s &quot;loyal friends who hate particular people,&quot; say, JeffG., &quot;merely because SEK does&quot;?</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s sad, but predictable, that the folks at <em>PW</em> can&#39;t understand the basic structure of an abusive relationship: but every time I give Jeff a chance to demonstrate that he still has something resembling integrity, there are people who beg me not to reengage him because they know how it will end . . . and one of those people happens to be the one in the publishing industry I tapped to forward my email to Andersen.  Had I requested she do the same for Jeff, not only would she have told me &quot;No,&quot; she would&#39;ve told me <em>off</em>.  </p>

<p>Which is why I said it was &quot;sad,&quot; because I wouldn&#39;t want to live in a world where my friends didn&#39;t look out for me---where they didn&#39;t make the effort to point out my blind-spots and try to steer me safely home.</p></span>

<p>The above quote was your intro to the concept of insult &amp; ask. It was in response to your reply. Therefore, it did not precede the request, it followed it. This is misleading.</p>

<p>But I must admit, following your link, that Jeff G. did start insulting you two days ago. He asked people to tell you that you are a liar. And &quot;Fuck them, all of them&quot; he wrote, including you. I had actualy commented on that thread but blew right past that stuff about telling you that you are a liar, and &quot;fuck them,&#39; including you, and so on.</p>

<p>So, I acknowledge that he started saying insulting things about you two days ago. I admit that I was wrong.</p>

<p>Now you can admit that you misrepresented the timing of the quote above, either through error or to make a better story. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone believes Jeff actually sent that exact email.  It&#39;s obviously doctored so as to be funny, which is why JPRS and Richard Pennyfarthing ran with it up-thread.  So yes, I&#39;m more than happy to admit that the email was meant to characterize the situation as pithily as possible.  Which, as you note, it did.  </p></span>

<p>I note that he wrote that at 10:06 p.m. yesterday only because I noted that I was reading the comments <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/conservatives-are-outraged-over-an-actual-outrage-color-me-impressed.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5eed23a970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5eed23a970c" rel="nofollow"><em>the day before</em> at 9:25 p.m.</a>  Why is that hilarious?

Apparently, I find it rhetorically <em>biting</em> to speak of common knowledge as if it were common knowledge---am I an idiot or what?</p>

<p>Back to the aforementioned funnier stuff.  His commenters think that Jeff&#39;s possessions of my emails constitute a threat.  <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15340#comment-789561" rel="nofollow">Seriously</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Please note that Jeff has your full e-mails.</blockquote>

<p>You know who else has my full emails?  Me!  You know who&#39;s not threatened by the fact that Jeff has them?  Also me!  Here are all my responses, edited to remove what Jeff wrote because, unlike him, I don&#39;t publish other people&#39;s emails without their permission:</p>

<blockquote>1.  [<em>Jeff requests Andersen&#39;s email.</em>]

<p>Unless my memory deceives me, you also know someone who works at the firm that represents Andersen, Trident Media, and can have her forward your email to him yourself.</p>

<p>2.  [<em>Jeff whines.</em>]</p>

<p>I thought you were at Hopkins with [<em>XXX</em>]. Doesn&#39;t matter, though, because I don&#39;t have Andersen&#39;s email address, so I can&#39;t give it to you.</p>

<p>3.  [<em>Jeff accuses me of lying because I said I&#39;d written Andersen and can&#39;t fathom how I might manage that without his email---even though Jeff performed the very same miracle with Cashill not but 24 hours earlier.</em>]</p>

<p>Your reading skills are for shit now.  Here&#39;s my first reply to you:</p>

<p><em>Unless my memory deceives me, you also know someone who works at the firm that represents Andersen, Trident Media, and can have her forward your email to him yourself.</em></p>

<p>Remember how you, to quote yourself, wrote [<em>in <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/turns-out-i-owe-jack-cashill-an-apology.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5f1ee73970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5f1ee73970c" rel="nofollow">this comment</a>, not a private email</em>] &quot;[H]ere&#39;s the email I sent to the editor at <em>American Thinker</em> (who sent it on to Mr. Cashill) along with his response&quot;?  If you think about it for a second, you&#39;ll realize that &quot;the editor at <em>American Thinker</em>&quot; and an agent &quot;at the firm that represents Andersen, Trident Media&quot; are dots that can be connected in the how-to-contact-people-without-their-email-addresses department.</p>

<p>If you have problems understanding why I&#39;m reluctant to ask a friend to do me a favor and forward an email by someone who thinks I&#39;m scum to the client of another agent, you need to spend more time around people and learn how they work.  (But by all means, continue to claim that my reluctance is based on my desire to remain ignorant of Andersen&#39;s relation to Cashill.  It&#39;s not like I emailed Andersen to ask him---wait, actually I did.)</p>

<p>4. [<em>Jeff sent another email made of fail and made <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15337#comment-789331" rel="nofollow">this comment</a>, which prompted me to write the email Jeff posted without my permission this morning.</em>]</blockquote></p>

<p>My posting of these has the added benefit of me being able to prove (yet again) that Jeff&#39;s a liar.  In response to <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15340#comment-789561" rel="nofollow">this question</a> directed at me:</p>

<blockquote>[D]id you specifically tell Jeff that you didn’t provide an e-mail due to the lack of a response?</blockquote>

<p>Jeff wrote:</p>

<blockquote>No, he did not.</blockquote>

<p>Which---given that in the second email I wrote that &quot;I don&#39;t have Andersen&#39;s email address, so I can&#39;t give it to you&quot;---is the sort of thing only a liar would write.  Moreover, his next sentence reads:</p>

<blockquote>If he didn’t have one, all he needed to say was he didn’t have one.</blockquote>

<p>Which---given that in the second email I wrote that &quot;I don&#39;t have Andersen&#39;s email address, so I can&#39;t give it to you&quot;---means he is both a liar <em>and</em> someone whose reading skills, as I noted in the next email, &quot;are for shit now.&quot;  </p>

<p>That only matters because it&#39;s the basis of everyone calling me a liar for characterizing Jeff&#39;s accusations as &quot;baseless shit.&quot;  I&#39;ll let the folks at <em>PW</em> decide if accusations based on lies are baseless or not.</p>

<p>Finally, because I&#39;m the kind of person who gets angry on the behalf of friends, <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15337#comment-789210" rel="nofollow">look at what Jeff said here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>I do so like how he treats happy as a pet.</blockquote>

<p>Apparently, happy is now my pet and I treat him as such.  I mean, it <em>looks</em> like he&#39;s here of his own volition, comments where- and whenever he pleases, but in actuality, I keep happy chained on the porch and let him post comments of pre-approved content to the blog before we take our twice-daily constitutionals.  Jeff is absolutely not a liar here: happy is a kept man and I am his keeper.  Really! </p></span>

<p>Aside from the fact that it&#39;s entirely obvious (if you follow the links, and Scott is probably the only person whose links to PW I&#39;d follow) that the time shift has taken place, what makes this both funny and acceptable is that Jeff G.  <i>ever</i> asked for help from someone to whom he wrote or sincerely thought so poorly of. Also, that he&#39;d express it so openly in the context of trying to get help, which is, I suppose, a small tribute to his honesty (which is, judging by what I know, small), if not his empathy.</p></span>

Was it asking for help, or giving SEK a challenge to assist in putting competing versions of the story to the test? I saw it as the latter. Jeff G. will certainly find a way to contact Andersen without help from SEK. One would think that SEK would have a selfish interest in Andersen being contacted, so as to buttress his own version of events.  </p>

<p>You want competing ideas to be tested, right SEK? You know, like a scientist would. It looks bad when somebody asks for a copy of your data, and only gets your life story and a run-around.</p></span>

Independent confirmation of Cashill's claim that William Ayers penned the President's memoir comes in the form of a book by celebrity biographer Christopher Andersen. Cashill is right to be excited—it's not every day you blunder to the plate, close your eyes, swing for the fences and have your prayers answered. That's what the arrival of corroborating evidence in Andersen's book amounts to, and no researcher who's found corroboration of the sort in independently researched materials will begrudge Cashill the tone of unreserved glee and grammatical abandon evident in his latest post: In his new book, &quot;Barack and Michelle: Portrait of an American Marriage,&quot; Best-selling celebrity journalist, Christopher Andersen, has blown a huge hole in the Obama genius myth without intending to do so. Who cares that book titles are traditionally underlined or italicized, capital letters belong at the beginning of sentences, or that he uses, commas, like an undergraduate when independent research has provided a factual basis for his speculative argument: Relying on inside sources, quite possibly Michelle Obama herself, Andersen describes how Dreams came to be published—just as I had envisioned it in my articles on the authorship of Dreams. With the deadline pressing, Michelle recommended that Barack seek advice from &quot;his friend and Hyde Park neighbor Bill Ayers.&quot; Only a killjoy would complain that Michelle Obama couldn't be a source, &quot;quite possibly&quot; or otherwise, because Andersen wrote an unauthorized biography—which, by definition, is a biography whose subject or subjects did not participate in its composition. That those &quot;inside sources&quot; who knew of Michelle's purported recommendation are not named, i.e. sourced, is the sort of thing that, despite being true, only someone who hated joy would point out. Andersen continues, &quot;In the end, Ayers's contribution to Barack's Dreams From My Father would be significant—so much so that the book's language, oddly specific references, literary devices, and themes would bear a jarring similarity to Ayers's own writing.&quot; Even though Cashill jettisons the very pretense of formatting book titles here, and even though Andersen's claim is couched in a conditional clause (&quot;would be significant&quot;) of the sort favored by authors who learned their libel law from the wrong end of many lawsuits, we should not let such quibbles diminish the importance of this independent, corroborating evidence—especially when, even though Cashill doesn't identify him in his post, these claims come from a named source: In the end, Ayers's contribution of Barack's Dreams from My Father would be significant—so much so that the book's language, oddly specific references, literary devices, and themes would bear a jarring similiarity to Ayers's own writings . . . &quot;There was a good deal of literary back-scratching going on in Hyde Park,&quot; said writer Jack Cashill, who noted that a mutual friend of Barack and Ayers, Rashid Khalidi, thanked Ayers for helping him with his book Resurrecting Empire.

I will now post some of the emails Jeff Goldstein has sent me over the years. After all, as one of his own commenters wrote, &quot;[he] has it coming.&quot; And he does. Still, for the better part of two days I clung to the high road. Then I realized that I'd never stop crying myself to sleep every night if I let this stand. Goldstein had left me in a bind: either I spend the rest of my nights choking back sobs, or I do something that disgusts decent people and have the sycophants who comment on my blog write insulting things about Goldstein on my behalf until I cared even less about the opinion of someone whose opinion means nothing to me. What choice did I have? Goldstein's not some random internet someone—he's someone whose opinion I claim not to value and he is out there, right now, writing critical stuff about an issue I claim not to care about. If ever a situation called for an uncalled for breach of etiquette, it is this one. So, without further ado, here's the email Jeff sent on 29 May 2006: Thanks for XXXXXXX. I haven't XXXX XXXXXXX of XXXXXXX since XXX XXXXXXX, but I would XXXX to XXX XXXXX XX XXX XXXXXXXXX at some point. I would go on, but as it continues in the same offensive vein at some length, you can get the flavor of it from that excerpt. This one from 1 June 2007 is truly explosive: I XXXXX I XXXXXXXX on the XXXXXXXXXX on the XXXXX example from XXXXX and XXXXXXXX in my XXXXXX XXXXX to XXXX this XXXXX. I could hardly believe it either. Even though I was privy to the particulars of that situation, I recoiled when I read Goldstein's take on it. Who says such things? More to the point: who says such things about them? I should have been outraged then, but to my eternal shame, at that moment I thought the matter had been settled and better left alone. I'm going to make up for that now by doing what I should've done then: I'm going to publish Goldstein's home address. I encourage anyone who thinks he needs to be punished for saying that about them to go to the following address and make your displeasure known: Jeff Goldstein XXXX XXXXXX XX XXXXXXXXX XX XXXXX-XXXX You know what? I do feel better. I should act on my basest instincts more often.</span></a></div>
