Is it any wonder conservatives so desperately want to crack open our little liberal monopoly on the good life? If there are any volunteers to read my prospectus before I send it off tomorrow, I'd appreciate the help. I should finish the section on the decidedly Lamarckian evolution of traditionally animated Funshine Bear into CGI monstrosity Funshine Bear by hour's end. I'll post and open it up for comments shortly thereafter.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/04/the_duration_of.html"><span><strong>The Duration of Life of Literary Men</strong> According to William Guy in the September, 1859 edition of The Quarterly Journal of the Statistical Society, determining the duration of the life of literary men is more difficult than composing &quot;A Summary View of the Duration of Life in the upper and middle ranks of society.&quot; Why? Because literary men, both in prose and verse, are of every rank and profession .... In treating, therefore, of the duration of life of literary men, I must be understood to be speaking of a mixed class, consisting on the one hand, of those who have no one distinct and defined professional calling, but who make literature one of their pursuits, and the duration of whose life is consequently affected by the habits of composition in very various degress; and, on the other hand, of those with whom literature is a distinct profession. Guy collected from the 1815 to 1852 editions of Chalmers' Biographical Dictionary a compendium of the ages at which 942 &quot;men more or less devoted to literary pursuits, and of more or less celebrity in different walks of literature&quot; perished. He compiled these three tables. His conclusions? &quot;It is quite possible that the poetical temperament, as it is commonly called, may be a phase of constitutional weakness, and a cause of early death.&quot; &quot;That schoolmasters who devote themselves to literary pursuits should rank next above poets, but decidedly below the other classes in the Table, will not excite surprise when it is borne in mind that in addition to such influence as literary habits themselves may exercise in undermining health and shortening life, the schoolmaster is exposed to the serious drawback of confinement with his pupils during many hours of the day in an atmosphere rarely of the purest. I am comforted by the fact that the average age of schoolmasters who survive to 26 is 63.91. That beats the English aristocracy by 12.3 years, although all those revolts, wars, beheadings, etc. no doubt weighed down their mean. But none of this answers the question of why this schoolmaster's 102-103 degree fever refuses to break. The answer? This schoolmaster has pneumonia and has been barred by his doctor from teaching until his fever swells no more. Were I thinking as profoundly as I'm sweating, thoughts about the deleterious scholarly miasma in which I currently wade would follow, but it appears I have some serious sweating to do...</span></a></div>
