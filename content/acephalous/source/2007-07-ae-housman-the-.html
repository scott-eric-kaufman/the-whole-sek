<p><a href="http://www.greekworks.com/content/index.php/weblog/extended/a_e_housman/" rel="nofollow">http://www.greekworks.com/content/index.php/weblog/extended/a_e_housman/</a><br />
 <br />
 <br />
There is a narrowness in Housman that does not just reflect a just appreciation of his own limits, but which contains as well a deliberate refusal to acknowledge anything great beyond his own expertise. The critic Edmund Wilson pointed out long ago how absurd Housman is when he applies Lucretius’ words about Epicurus – lucida tela dieï (brilliant shafts of sunlight) – to Bentley’s edition of Manilius. All the careful exactness of Housman goes along with a pettiness of spirit that at least at times is out of control and expresses a contempt for whatever he does not understand. </p></span>

<p>It would be a shame if Housman were remembered for his bilious invective rather than his scholarship. And it seems like &quot;precise&quot; does not describe his style, although &quot;vicious&quot; is right on the money; H&#39;s talents as a witherer seem to have lain more in the direction of scathing exaggeration: </p>

<p>&quot;Not to be silenced by the grandeur of the institution or its famous members, he did not conceal his contempt for the scholarship of the great Benjamin Jowett, Regius Professor of Greek and master of Balliol, calling his Plato ‘the best translation of a Greek philosopher which has ever been executed by a person who understood neither philosophy nor Greek’.&quot;</p></span>

Doctorow loves &quot;grown-up uses for popups&quot;? I thought he'd sworn undying devotion to Alice in Wonderland dishes; or was it The Wombles of Wimbleton Common? I have it all wrong: Doctorow's one and only is Stinkpad, or maybe Transmetropolitan. No, I remember now, his heart belongs to Podium CoolPads or waterproof cases for Exilim cameras, one or the other, unless you count The Beastles' Let It Beast, Quicksilver, or Shrook 2.0. Pressed to choose, I'm sure vintage Disney ephemera would be his true, mad, total squeeze. Not that he ever will be, mind you. Doctorow's a lover, not &quot;The Decider.&quot; Without doubt, there's a larger point to be made about exuberant online rhetoric, Boing Boing's popularity, Doctorow's influence, &amp;c. It being Sunday and me having a long slog through minimally edited prose ahead, I'll need you to tackle that for me. Speak brilliance, people: I don't want to swipe second-rate material. UPDATE: Someone requested the short version of that argument, so here it is: Doctorow's wandering eye is endemic to blogs as a genre. He can't help but have fleeting infatuations with momentarily indispensable items, because otherwise he wouldn't have anything to write about. I'm not saying his enthusiasm isn't genuine; only that it's structured, in part, by a blog-based mentality. Is this a good thing? Depends. I'd find it exhausting and expensive—as I did during those unhalcyon BBS days—but I see Doctorow as a member of the tech-class whose interests and finances outstrip mine, so I've no doubt he lives a fascinating and fulfilling life.</span></a></div>
