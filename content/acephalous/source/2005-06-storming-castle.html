<p>
A broken Mr. Dorrit, recently of Marshalsea prison, moved over the
French countryside.&nbsp; Ensconced in his “snug corner,”
he
</p>
<blockquote><p>fell to castle-building as he rode along. It was evident
that he had a very large castle in hand. All day long he was running
towers up, taking towers down, adding a wing here, putting on a
battlement there, looking to the walls, strengthening the defences,
giving ornamental touches to the interior, making in all respects a
superb castle of it...</p></blockquote>
<p>
On the heels of last week’s discussion on <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/crypto_communisto_conflagration_100_guaranteed_or_happenstance_and_identity/">alternative histories</a>, I’m inspired by China Mieville’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0345444388/qid=1119292159/sr=8-3/ref=pd_bbs_3/103-0718353-4437452?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846"><em>The Scar</em></a>
to ask a similar question about a similar speculative endeavour:
building castles in the air.&nbsp; New Crobuzon’s one of the best
realized castle-in-the-air I’ve ever encountered.&nbsp; Its
effectiveness, I’d wager, stems from the manner in which it seems
not to have been created but <em>evolved</em>.&nbsp; I once spent three months in <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/urbino/53_urbino.html">Urbino</a> and as soon as that city--with its <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/urbino/49_urbino.html">unreal angles</a> and centuries old inhumanly steep streets of <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/urbino/50_urbino.html">inlaid brick ladders</a>--seeps
into your brain, the obsession with cities as agglutinate as German
concept-nouns inevitably follows.&nbsp; So it has.&nbsp; (So much so
I’m even fascinated by Jon Jerde’s <a href="http://www.wildnatureimages.com/images%202/041008-116..jpg">excessively</a> <a href="http://www.photohome.com/pictures/california-pictures/san-diego/horton-plaza-1a.jpg">colorful</a> simulations.)&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
For the sake of clarity, I’ll call these “evolved
cities,” as “representations of fictional cities earthed in
a faux-historical developmental process such that it’s as
compellingly complex and un-invented-seeming as Drieser’s Chicago
or Chandler’s Los Angeles” sounds deeply stupid.&nbsp; So,
yes, literary representations of similarly “evolved
cities.” I’ve located a number myself, including Marco
Polo’s in Calvino’s <em>Invisible Cities</em>--although
I’m looking for fully realized cities, so Calvino can’t
really count--William Gibson’s suburb-on-a-bridge in <em>Virtual Light</em>; Gormenghast Castle in Peake’s <em>Titus Groans</em> and <em>Gormenghast</em>; the Orange/Los Angeles/San Diego County mall-complex in Robinson’s <em>The Gold Coast</em>;
etc.&nbsp; The unflattering way to phrase this request would be that
I’m looking for works which’ll foster the felt-immersion of
a fourteen-year-old’s first encounter with Tolkien or an
undergraduate’s first flipping of <em>Ulysses</em>.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
So come on already!&nbsp; This is a p-a-r-t-y!&nbsp; Your
quarter/semester/Monday’s done and what would you rather do than
discuss your favorite fictional environs?&nbsp; Don’t tell me
you’re all off watching <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/scholar/index.html"><em>The Scholar</em></a>.
</p>

<p>A Highly Personal (and Possibly Inappropriate) P.S.: If
anyone’s ever figured out all the film references on John
Vanderslice’s <a href="http://www.johnvanderslice.com/html/lyrics_cd.html"><em>Cellar Door</em></a>
and wouldn’t mind sharing them, I’d be forever in your
debt.&nbsp; I’ve connected the obvious--&quot;Promising Actress”
and <em>Mulholland Drive</em> and “When It Hits My Blood” and <em>Requiem for a Dream</em>--but outside of the obvious I’m as dense as ever.

Yes, but... The playful screels and screechs of unsupervised children have been replaced by the pained screams of unsupervised children who've decided to play near the swarming bees. Even with the A/C unit blasting in my face I imagine I hear the low buzz of tens of thousands of bees describing pointless circles around my apartment. Were it not for my cowardice I would egress and observe what Mr. Ellis calls &quot;one of the most beautiful and interesting phenomena in nature&quot; in more detail. Alas! I am a coward. When the tableaux of bees and bees and bees presents itself before me, I seek shelter in the nearest building not over-filled with pheromone-happy bees drawn to the scent of their queen. I close the front door. All the windows. The vent above the oven. I open the closet door. I take out the duct tape. I rip strips from it and place them around the doors, windows and vents I've closed. I hyperventilate. I breath in a bag. To no avail. I pass out. I dream of work-a-day lives in futuristic utopian communes. I watch as workers crowds the suspense-bridges tethered by invisible lines to unseen columns and listen to the gentle hum of their morning mumblings. I enter the moving throng and jostle elbows with the other workers as the bridges below my feet judders in harmony with the low buzz of their uncaffeinated conversation. I recall the supple undulations of the earthquake, magnitude 5.3, which rattled shelves and startled cats the previous afternoon. Subdued beneath the feet of my brethren, the bridge begins to yield. I race for the rails but so do all my brethren. The gentle hum of moments previous volumes louder until it crests and then the drones' inverted drones sound a panicked cacophony echoing their moral discord and as they run pell-mell on the faltering bridge--its invisible lines snapped, its unseen columns fallen--I stare into their faces and see though legion only one. I grab one by the buckle of his drab brown unitard and scream &quot;Who are all you? Who are all you who must by Our Leader's ordinance die this day?&quot; He turns to me. One by one they all turn to me. In unison they say, &quot;We are Dr. Marion Ellis.&quot; I awake, shaking.</span></a></div>
