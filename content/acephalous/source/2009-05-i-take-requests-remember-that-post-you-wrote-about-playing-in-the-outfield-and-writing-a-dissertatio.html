<p>I played third base and shortstop.&#0160; I played them well.&#0160; I had sure
hands and quick feet.&#0160; When the ball screamed off the bat, there was no
time to think.&#0160; There was only time to react.&#0160; </p>

<p>Move the quick feet.&#0160; Catch with sure hands.&#0160; Throw the ball.&#0160; </p>

<p>In between pitches, I would look to the man to my left to make sure

<p>Move the quick feet.&#0160; Catch with sure hands.&#0160; Throw the ball.</p>

<p>In the infield I felt like part of a team.&#0160; I could look to my left
and catch the second baseman&#39;s eye.&#0160; I could look across the diamond
and catch the first baseman&#39;s eye.&#0160; I was a player among players.&#0160; We
all knew how to react and how to react together.&#0160; </p>



<p>Then one year my coach wanted me to play center field.&#0160; Being a team
player, I consented.&#0160; I&#39;d shagged flies during practice, and was better
than most at going back on a ball.&#0160; So why not?</p>




<p>I left the dugout and jogged past my teammates.&#0160; Then I kept jogging until my teammates looked like toy soldiers.</p>



<center><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/28/centerfieldpov03.jpg"><img alt="Centerfieldpov03" border="0" class="image-full " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/28/centerfieldpov03.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" title="Centerfieldpov03" /></a>
</center>

<p>I stood there.&#0160; I was still playing baseball.&#0160; Only alone.&#0160; Three
hundred and ninety feet from home plate.&#0160; Two hundred feet from anybody
else.&#0160; </p>

<p>Short screaming or semaphore, I couldn&#39;t catch anyone&#39;s attention.&#0160; I was alone.&#0160; </p>


<p>See home plate in the shot above?&#0160; No?&#0160; Click on the picture to
enlarge it.&#0160; See it now?&#0160; Focus your attention on the tiny white dot
near dead center.&#0160; There&#39;s another to its right.&#0160; Either will work.&#0160;
Zoom in on them.&#0160; Those tiny dots are twice the size of a man&#39;s head.&#0160; </p>

<p>Now imagine something an eighth that size come shooting from the crowd.&#0160; </p>

<p>You track the ball.&#0160; You run intuitive <a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:NePxgrnqxwIJ:www.gpc.edu/%7Emcse/CourseDocs/Math1101Projects/project2DE.doc">quadratic models</a>.&#0160; You run where you think it will land.&#0160; You compensate for drag.&#0160; The wind blows it to the left.&#0160; </p>

<p>You run intuitive quadratic models.&#0160; You compensate for drag.&#0160; </p>

<p>Or the right.&#0160; </p>

<p>You run intuitive quadratic models.&#0160; You compensate for drag.</p>

<p>Or further behind you.&#0160; </p>

<p>You run intuitive quadratic models.&#0160; You compensate for drag.</p>

<p>You adjust course.&#0160; You adjust speed.&#0160; All the while you track the
ball.&#0160; All the while you calculate.&#0160; The ball hangs in the air for
seconds.&#0160; You spend every last one of them calculating.&#0160; </p>

<p>This is not about reaction.&#0160; </p>

<p>This is not about moving the quick feet.&#0160; This is not about catching with sure hands.&#0160; This is different. <br /> </p>

<p>And you are alone. </p>

<p>And everyone is watching you.&#0160; </p>

<p>All eyes follow your eyes following the ball.&#0160; You feel them.&#0160; The
weight of them.&#0160; They&#39;re relying on you to know how wide and fast to
stride.&#0160; They trust the calculations you&#39;ve made.&#0160; They trust in the
ones you will.&#0160; Sometimes that trust is well-placed.&#0160; </p>

<p>Sometimes not.</p>

<p>Writing a dissertation is like playing center field:&#0160; </p>

<p>Your eyes light on something small launched at an incredible
distance.&#0160; Time slows.&#0160; You calculate where it will land.&#0160; You
compensate for drag.&#0160; You track it as it flies.&#0160; While sprinting.&#0160; You
adjust your course.&#0160; </p>

<p>You are alone.&#0160; Everyone is watching you.<br /> </p>

<p>Fear overtakes you.&#0160; You will lose the ball in the lights.&#0160; You will
lose the ball in the high glare of a slate sky.&#0160; You will trip.&#0160; You
will stumble.&#0160; You will fail.</p>

<p>You compose yourself.&#0160; While tracking.&#0160; While sprinting.&#0160; Your chest hurts.&#0160; Your legs ache.&#0160; Then:</p>

<p>The satisfying recoil.&#0160; </p>

<p>You close your glove around the ball.&#0160; You gather your wits.&#0160; You throw the ball back to the infield.&#0160; </p>

<p>Writing a dissertation is like playing center field with one difference: </p>

<p>No satisfying recoil.&#0160; </p>

<p>The fear is there.&#0160; As are the calculations.&#0160; And the gasping.&#0160; And
the aching.&#0160; &#0160;Sometimes you exhilarate in your own breathless grace.&#0160;
Certainly.&#0160; And sometimes you admire the ball descending its clean
arc.&#0160; Of course.&#0160; But:<br /> </p>

<p>There is no satisfying recoil.&#0160; There is no salutary smack of ball on leather.&#0160; Not yet.&#0160; </p>

<p>You are the <a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:vWyFJbvrTwEJ:digitalunion.osu.edu/r2/summer06/maynor/journal_articles/Uncatchable_Balls_Paper.pdf+trajectory+baseball">outfielder problem</a>

Michaels, Bakker, &amp; Davids, 1999; Todd, 1981).&#0160; </p>

<p>You await your solution.&#0160; But: </p>

<p>You&#39;re still playing baseball.&#0160; You&#39;re still having fun.&#0160; But:<br /> </p>

<p>You are unsolved and you are surly.&#0160; </p>

<p>I know I am.</p>

To my ears there&#39;s a poetry to this, a real feeling of unironic despair, that I don&#39;t get with most of what you write, SEK.  If this is you writing &quot;naked,&quot; maybe you should try it more often?  Because obviously, people respond to it.</p></span>

Joe decided to take him down, his decline was swift. By Tuesday, he was on the phone telling a stranger to &quot;Choke on [his] . . . !&quot;</strong> It was a quiet Sunday afternoon when I became an enemy of the state. I was doing laundry, as you do, and was carrying a load of towels up three flights of stairs when suddenly the landing turned all &quot;GO JOE!&quot; As I crushed Snake Eyes Eyes with my left foot and tumbled head first into a hamper of clean towels, I thought to myself, &quot;If you're going to fall head first into something, you could do a lot worse than towels fresh from the dryer.&quot; My head was safe, but with his dying breath, that wee plastic Snake Eyes rolled over and took my ankle with him. I scream into clean laundry as my ankle pivots in ways God never intended. Knowing that I have to teach on Tuesday, on Monday I contact the people with the little carts and ask for a lift to class. &quot;No problem,&quot; a helpful person tells me. &quot;That's what we're here for,&quot; she says. She takes down some information and assures me we're all set. Someone will be at my place shortly before 7:00 a.m. to pick me up and take me class. Fast forward to Tuesday morning. SEK: (looking at his watch) I'm ten minutes early. Nothing can possibly go wrong. (ten minutes pass) Probably just running a little late. (five more minutes pass) Maybe I should call to check up. PERSON WHO ANSWERS THE PHONE: What? SEK: I'm calling about a ride to campus. Someone was supposed to pick me up so I could teach. (shuffling sounds can be heard) DIFFERENT PERSON: Can I help you with something? SEK: I'm calling about a ride to campus. Someone was supposed to pick me up so I could teach. DIFFERENT PERSON: Right. We can't do that. SEK: You can't do that? DIFFERENT PERSON: Right. We need a doctor's note and you didn't provide one. SEK: I'm seeing the doctor tomorrow. I can bring a note in afterwards. DIFFERENT PERSON: Right. That's not how it works here. SEK: So how am I supposed to get to class? DIFFERENT PERSON: You live on campus. Why not just walk? SEK: (rage) If I could walk, I wouldn't have requested your services. DIFFERENT PERSON: Right. We can't do that for you. (the shuffling sounds associated with hanging up a phone can be heard) SEK: (Rage) Better don't hang up on me. (more shuffling) How am I supposed to teach today if I can't get to class? DIFFERENT PERSON: Like I already said, you live on campus. Just walk. SEK: (RAGE) And like I already said, if I could fucking walk, I wouldn't have requested your fucking services. DIFFERENT PERSON: There's really no need to say &quot;fuck,&quot; sir. SEK: CHOKE ON MY FUCK, ASSHOLE! The upside is that I solved one of life's little mysteries: every quarter I teach the Warren Ellis piece linked there, and every quarter I'm rebaffled by that expression. I'm baffled no more. But you know what the best part is? Guess what I...</span></a></div>
