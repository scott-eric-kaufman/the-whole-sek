You need to try to have a life outside your computer.  Just saying....it seems I have more life now then you have and we know how little I get out!</p></span>

I&#39;d read Watchmen a short while before and appreciated its narrative complexity, but not being used to reading comics, hadn&#39;t registered all the technical tricks that the artist was using to achieve this. The post not only taught me something about the grammar of such images, but more importantly led to me realising that there is a grammar to look for in the first place. So thanks a lot for that one.</p></span>

Plus Justifying Comics as a Legitimate Object of Study Parts I &amp; II. I also liked &quot;Teaching the Overdetermined Image.&quot; Your takedown of Cashill and the whole Ayers-wrote-Dreams was excellent, and the Cruel_cruel_death post (you know what I&#39;m talking about, right?).</p>

<p>Also, The Day in Actual Communist and Real Nazi History seems as relevant today as ever.</p></span>

Collins; on Thursday, Sean T. Collins published this. What a coincidence!</span></a></div>

Standing behind his SmartPodium is an unfamiliar person who looks startled by Scott's arrival. SCOTT: Are you supposed to be in here? PERSON WHO ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE: (shrugs) SCOTT: Did you just finish teaching? PERSON WHO DIDN'T JUST FINISH TEACHING: (shrugs) SCOTT: Can I help you with something? PERSON WHO DOESN'T WANT ME TO HELP HIM WITH SOMETHING: (shrugs) SCOTT: Do you understand English? PERSON WHO CLEARLY UNDERSTANDS ENGLISH BUT IS ABOUT TO DART OUT THE DOOR: (darts out the door) Scott approaches the podium to find dozens of windows open, each and every one of which proves that Rule 34 is correct: there is porn of it. All of it. Then Scott remembers that you have to log into SmartPodiums with your UCINet ID, and that your UCINet ID is also the first half of your UCI email address. Scott mouses over the toolbar to obtain the stranger's UCINet ID and proceeds to write him an email: Dear Person Watching Porn on the SmartPodium, Please don't watch porn on the SmartPodium. People have to teach there, you know? Five minutes later, Scott receives a reply: I don't know what you're talking about! Stop starting shit! I've never even been in the Physical Sciences Classroom Building before! Scott was really tempted to inform the stranger that nobody said he had, but as subsequent denials would only diminish the beauty of the stranger's inadvertent confession, he refrained.</span></a></div>
