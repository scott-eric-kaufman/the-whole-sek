You know: Scott figures that he can get more points in if he divides his talk into 11 &quot;minutes&quot; rather than 10 minutes; Scott shows off &quot;The Blank Overhead&quot;, a projection accidentally erased that now serves as a meditation on where all our ideas come from; Scott in his latter days must speak at a blogging panel in the local Elks Lodge along with Kaye Grogan and as headliner the Fafblog guy, who doesn&#39;t show (with an advertisement showing &quot;Tonight: THE MEDIUM LOBSTER, Kaye Grogan, also Scot Kaufmann&quot;), finally, it is announced that Scott is big in Japan and gets to go on a final triumphant tour along with a translator and a quick study guide for Sailor Moon.</p></span>

<p>Clever, Adam, clever.  </p>

<p>Mike, as soon as Eric Rauchway tells me where it is, I&#39;ll 1) watch it in horror and 2) post a link.</p>

<p>Constructivist, when I make it Big In Japan, I&#39;ll be disappointed by anything less adventurous than <em>Lost in Translation</em>.  I demand <em>adventure</em> when I travel.  (As Adam will find out when I pelt him with paint balls from a makeshift blind.)</p></span>

You guys are graduate students. Moreover, you two are playing on her turf. Abraham Lincoln was a lawyer, not a graduate student. Not that you could take her on yours, mind you. See, for example, her magisterial display of intertextual prowess, in which she pairs an episode of The Sopranos with the most literal poem in human history, W.B. Yeats' &quot;The Second Coming&quot;: You need to study the poem as you rewatch the episode. It's not enought to say &quot;Things fall apart ... Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,&quot; so there's going to be an all-out war between Tony and Phil. Or &quot;somewhere in sands of the desert ... what rough beast ... Slouches towards Bethlehem,&quot; so all that talk about the Mideast and terrorism is going to have to be part of the series dénouement. There must be endless depths there. You're just getting started. Perhaps Tony will find his humanity (or is he the &quot;rough beast&quot;?). He gives an expensive watch to Carmela, which is typical for him, but what was that inscription? He tries to connect with the guys talking about his peyote visions, but he fails. He tells Phil he wants to talk to him &quot;on a human level.&quot; Which also fails. He saves his son from drowning. (&quot;blood-dimmed tide... innocence is drowned.&quot;) The water imagery from last week. He cradles the son he saves. Mother imagery from last week. He starts saying &quot;poor you,&quot; the way his own mother Livia did. More mother references. Before saving his son from drowning, he eats the &quot;Lincoln log&quot; food Carmela made to try cheer up A.J. Imagery carried over from last week: mother, phallus, assassinated President. Consider yourself pre-schooled. Let me walk you dolts through this brilliance one brilliant sentence at a brilliant time: You need to study the poem as you rewatch the episode ... ... with a law degree in one hand, a glass of wine in the other. It's not enough to say &quot;Things fall apart ... Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,&quot; so there's going to be an all-out war between Tony and Phil. Because Tony and Phil are &quot;the world,&quot; like in the poem you studiously studied, in which &quot;things fall apart&quot; and on which &quot;anarchy is loosed.&quot; (Ann's absolutely right to ignore the &quot;mere.&quot; It's a useless poetry word poets throw in when they need an extra beat.) Or &quot;somewhere in sands of the desert ... what rough beast ... Slouches towards Bethlehem,&quot; so all that talk about the Mideast and terrorism is going to have to be part of the series dénouement. Deserts and Bethlehem are both in the Middle East. (So is the Spiritus Mundi, for that matter.) There must be endless depths there. Word. You're just getting started. No, Ann, you are. I but bask in your reflected glory. Perhaps...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/gender_citation.html"><span><strong>Gender &amp; Citation: &quot;I'll Have Her, Please&quot;</strong> While collecting all my citations for the Jack London chapter, I noticed something unusual: I like women. I really, really like women. However, this may not be apparent when you first glance at the gender distribution of my citations: Male: 51 Female: 42 Remove multiple items from the same author and it looks like this: Male: 28 Female: 39 The steepness of the decline comes from the fact that I quote across the corpus of both London and Herbert Spencer. So of the 67 individuals I quote in this chapter, 58 percent of them are women. But things become even more interesting when the primary sources are removed: Male: 12 Female: 36 The overwhelming majority of contemporary scholarship I cite was written by women. The disparity seems especially odd considering the lion's share of London scholarship is written by men. Does this say something about me? London scholarship? Men who work on London? Women who do? I'm not sure. The Mitchell chapter is little help here, since there is so little contemporary work on him. My paper on eclecticism isn't useful either, since I was forced (by dint of history) to address the major figures, most of whom were men. I need more evidence, certainly, but I find it odd that when I select from a deep pool of contemporary scholarship, I gravitate to works written by women. I wonder whether I'm alone in this. Thoughts?</span></a></div>
