But <em>Hannibal </em>suggests he may have finally learned something.</p>
<p>For those of you who know nothing of American popular culture, <em>Hannibal </em>is
 a show about a man named <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Lecter" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Hannibal Lecter">Hannibal Lecter</a>. He’s a serial killer who 
loves playing psychological games with know-it-all FBI agents. That’s 
the show’s motivating irony: he’s contacted by the FBI to provide 
psychiatric support for their most gifted criminal profiler. He’s 
solving crimes! While copycatting them! Talk about dramatic irony! </p>
<p>The 
point being that this is a show about people with deep insight into the 
thought and behavior of sociopaths who fail to notice that their 
consultant’s therapist is one. It’s a show about psychological isolation
 — about people who can’t interact with the world or the people who 
inhabit it because there’s a felt distance between themselves and their 
humanity. So it only makes sense that even when they’re together, 
they’re alone. In “Potage,” for example, Lecter meets with the head of 
the FBI’s behavioral science division and one of their top 
psychiatrists:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00002.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00002.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="hannibal00002" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The long shot establishes that they’re all in the same room, which is
 important because if it didn’t, you might not realize that. The 
conversation proceeds via a series of medium close-ups in shallow focus:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00001.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00001.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="hannibal00001" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#38662">depth of field</a>
 is so shallow that the items on the front of his desk as unfocused as 
the wall behind him. His body occupies the thin slice of the world that 
the camera and lighting conspire into focus. Same with her:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00005.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00005.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="hannibal00005" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>And with him:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00010.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00010.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="hannibal00010" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The three of them are sitting in the same room but are connecting 
neither with it nor each other. Their psychological isolation is being 
represented by the thin slice of the diegetic world that happens to be 
in focus. How thin is it?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00011.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00011.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="hannibal00011" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Thinner than <em>this man’s face</em>. It’s almost as if this man — 
the aforementioned criminal profiler — doesn’t even understand himself. 
Maybe he should see somebody about that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00012.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00012.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="hannibal00012" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>That’s right — he already is and it’s not working. You can tell 
because even when Slade switches from medium close-ups that suggest that
 all men are islands to two-shots that should suggest companionship, the
 thin depth of field isn’t even ample enough to include both subjects in 
focus. How isolated does Slade want these people to seem? Even when 
they’re four of them <em>in the same frame</em> he racks the focus from one to another depending on who’s talking:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00013.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00013.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="hannibal00013" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00013.png"></a><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00014.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hannibal00014.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="hannibal00014" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Sticking four people in a frame and creating a sense that they’re talking <em>at</em> rather than <em>to </em>each
 other requires a deft touch I didn’t think Slade possessed. It’s not 
exactly unsubtle, but it effectively creates a mood that untrained 
viewers would describe as “creepy” without exactly knowing why. Instead 
of the shallow focus functioning as it normally does — to focus the 
audience’s attention on one element in the composition — the cumulative 
effect of these shots is a claustrophobia tinged with obsessive 
attentiveness. The world is small and largely unfocused except for this 
little slice of clarity. And on <em>Hannibal</em>, as often as not that 
little slice of clarity contains corpses mutilated by someone with an 
eye for composition. The mundane world of homes and offices and other 
people exists only in an unfocused and isolating haze; the frail horror 
of artfully desecrated bodies is sharply in focus.</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef017eeab6f3eb970d-content"><p>The thread&#39;s inert over at LGM, but another nugget that jumped out at me was the way Hannibal&#39;s and Crawford&#39;s offices are inverted on a close-up shot of Crawford. When Crawford is in Hannibal&#39;s waiting room, there&#39;s a lamp to his left and vertical molding to his right. In the next scene, we start with Crawford at his desk, and there&#39;s a lamp to his right and vertical molding to his left -- and inversion of the shot in the previous scene. That seemed like a deliberate choice, since both offices are the thinktanks where the shows&#39; crimes are being considered, both are bases where the operators are using Graham as a tool to solve these crimes, yet both are using their offices and Graham to very different ends, yet through similar means. Let&#39;s see if this works:</p>

<p>(<a href="http://s21.postimg.org/ibekj6h1j/hannibal_office_inversions.png" rel="nofollow">Bigger image here</a>.)</p>

<p>With regard to the slim slices of reality, I think there&#39;s something else happening on top of that: When Graham&#39;s in one of his fever dreams, or is putting himself in the mind of a killer, the depth of field is much greater -- almost the entire room has clarity and focus. This isn&#39;t consistent (I just looked at a couple of those scenes), but in ep. 4 (which didn&#39;t air in the U.S.) there&#39;s a scene where he&#39;s imagining what the killer saw in a family&#39;s home while they&#39;re sitting down to dinner, and the entire dining room is in sharp focus.</p></span>

Clearly, I'm a horrible teacher because students I never taught wore blackface on the Internet. So say the emails that poured in after a prominent conservative blogger tweeted my email address in connection with this local scandal. But as I scanned subject lines while deleting said emails, I noticed that I'm not the only one to blame. Irvine also has an African American Studies program that failed to prevent this racist display from happening. And a department of Asian American studies that neglected to inform an Asian American student that racism is bad. The Women's Studies department also did nothing to prevent this performance of antebellum proportions from occurring on its campus (because abortion). Point being, despite all these programs and departments dedicated to creating a more compassionate body politic, there are still students on the Irvine campus who are racist. Therefore, per these emails and the dictates of logic, the aforementioned departments should be shut down. They're disappointing the corporate charter. The only real solution to fighting racism is to stop fighting it. Then it'll just go away. UPDATE: I forgot to mention how humorless these &quot;studies&quot; people are, and how their humorlessness is responsible for everything wrong with America.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2013/04/why-the-collins-non-story-will-matter.html"><span><strong>Why the Collins “non-story” will matter</strong> The most important aspect of Jason Collins’s decision to become the first theoretically employable openly gay male in a major American sport isn’t that this “accomplishment” requires that many qualifiers, but that he has a twin brother who’s a heterosexual. So much of the rhetoric about homosexuality focuses on whether God made homosexuals gay or whether they’ve turned their back on the Lord by succumbing to learned perversions. The distinct sexualities of the Collins twins seem a boon to those who think homosexuals are etymological perverts: Jason has “turned aside” from the righteous path that is his birthright. Why did he do so? He was converted by childhood trauma or an agenda-driven homosexual into thinking his feelings for other men were normal; which is to say he “turned with” an individual who convinced him that other men were as attractive as women. God didn’t put the gay in him — someone abused it into him. Whether that abuse is sexual or rhetorical in nature matters less than the simple fact that it’s abuse. That it’s become socially acceptable for prime-time faggots to queer the very foundation of marriage is a sign that American culture’s in steep decline. Children are being converted into perverts — are turning with those who would turn them aside — and political correctness prevents decent people from objecting to this abuse. But all this talk of conversion and perversion obscures the fact that homosexuals haven’t always had their agenda implemented as precisely as a Zionist plot. Homosexuals were once considered a diaspora of narcissists who wandered the world looking for themselves. They were inverts. They’d “turned inward” and demanded of others the love the mirror denied them. Which is only to say that the operative metaphor changed. What was once thought to be a loathsome inversion of God’s love has become what happens to children when they watch Glee. Because when you introduce contemporary American culture into the classic conversion narrative you end up with a system of dissemination indistinguishable from infection. You don’t need to convince someone to “turn with” you if society’s “putting in” or “doing to” them what the homosexual agenda wants it to. Which is why conservatives express their concerns about Collins’s revelation by not caring with thunder. So long as they ignore its importance the epidemic can be contained. They want Collins to become a non-story. Hence the significance of the fact that Jason Collins has an identical twin brother who’s straight. The temptation to use Jarron Collins’s heterosexuality as proof that Jason was either converted to or infected by homosexuality will prove too great. That Jarron shares Jason’s DNA but not his perversion demonstrates once and for all that God doesn’t sanction the birth of gay babies. Jason couldn’t have been born this way because Jarron was too and look at him. Which means homosexuality is essentially a function of bad parenting: parents either didn’t pay enough attention to who tended to or played with their children or they allowed...</span></a></div>
