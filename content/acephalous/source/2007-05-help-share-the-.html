		<span id="comment-69629738-content"><p>Hmmm. (rubs chin thoughtfully.) Dr. Crazy has been blogging the whole painful process of revising a proposal and then a manuscript over at reassignedtime if you want a play by play of the pain. (which reminds me, you haven&#39;t said anything about constantly having to summarize the work in three sentences on the job market, or write a book proposal and then another proposal once you do have a contract.) </p>

<p>If you want nitpicking, I can nitpick: </p>

<p>&quot;over the next three years it becomes something more&quot;<br />
--- this is not as incisive as the rest and doesn&#39;t get at the pain and frustration and slogging.</p>

<p>&quot;Large sections are reconceptualized in an effort to create a manuscript more representative of the sum of its parts.  Years devoted to tinkering and conceptualizing, razing and reconceptualizing, rebuilding and resubmitting pass.&quot;<br />
--- this is repetitive and a bit dull. People who have actually revised dissertations into books tell me that the problems are that they are sick of the topic or that the cracks in their argument take on water faster than they can bail it out. </p>

<p>And in another random comment, if you tell a bunch of writers that &quot;writing is hard,&quot; you&#39;re not really teaching them something new, eh? My thought is you&#39;ll need some sort of new and interesting defamiliarization of writing that makes everyone understand it in a powerful way; get all Shklovsky on their ass.</p>

<p>Ah, could this comment be any longer and more pointless? Heh! Sorry if you wanted some praise and positive feedback there; evidently I don&#39;t work that way.</p></span>

<p>Then never mention the angry mob again.

		<span id="comment-69677008-content"><p>Brad,</p>

<p>You&#39;ll get yours next week, my friend.  You just wait.  I&#39;ve been practicing my guffaws, and I do a mean dismissive eye-roll.</p>

<p>Sisyphus,</p>

<p><em>this is not as incisive as the rest and doesn&#39;t get at the pain and frustration and slogging.</em></p>

<p>Good catch.  I wanted &quot;vaguely menacing,&quot; landed on &quot;vague.&quot;</p>

<p><em>this is repetitive and a bit dull.</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s what I was aiming for there: dull and desperate, sick and tired.  (I went with asyndeton for a reason.)  I&#39;m in that awkward position I used to put my students in: I like that I hit the desired effect, but don&#39;t like that the effect isn&#39;t seen to have a cause.  I&#39;ll have to think about that one.</p>

<p>As for how someone relates to the material of their first book project, I think you&#39;re right ... but that doesn&#39;t mitigate the horror that is getting it into print.  This is another way of saying that I&#39;m not going for &quot;writing is hard&quot; so much as &quot;all this intellectual labor is unrewarding,&quot; as a way of introducing the very rewarding experience of having your monograph book-evented.  </p>

<p>And no, I wasn&#39;t looking for praise.  I&#39;m <em>never</em> looking for praise.  Because of the people I work with, I&#39;m disinclined to trust anyone who praises me ... I immediately think they want something from me, and my suspicious mind wants to know what.  So please, hack away, boys, hack away.</p>

<p>Rich, </p>

<p>You slay me.  Serious advice would be helpful, but I may throw the Frankenstein bit in there anyway.</p>

<p>Colin,</p>

<p><em>What do you want from me, man?</em></p></span>

It gets at &quot;the horror of getting into print,&quot; although comparing producing a book to producing a child makes it sound more rewarding than you want.</p>

<p>And Rich, I think I had the angry mob with torches at my prospectus defense. Luckily, it turned into a love-fest over each other and I was able to crawl out unnoticed under the tables.</p></span>

<p>&quot;The average scholarly monograph begins life as a mere glimmer in the mind of a graduate student preparing for qualifying exams. Over the next three years, chapters are written then polished for the disciplinary flagships—ELH, American Literature, Critical Inquiry—then  their period escorts—Nineteenth Century Literature, Twentienth Century Literature, Postmodern Culture—only to land in the holds of the undead authors—The James Joyce Quarterly, The Henry James Review, &amp;c.  A few respectable publications to her name, the reversion from independent articles to interdependent chapters begins.  Large sections are reconceptualized to create a manuscript more representative of the sum of its parts.  Years pass, devoted to tinkering and conceptualizing, razing and reconceptualizing, rebuilding and resubmitting.  Seven, perhaps eight years after winking into existence, her monograph is accepted by one of the few remaining reputable scholarly publishers, to undergo corrections, cover design, get permissions [FOR WHAT?].  Ten, perhaps eleven years later, the monograph finally rests in its creator&#39;s hands. Interest-feigning friends and mentors receive copies, as do the very journals which rejected parts of it years earlier.  Her colleagues congratulate her and prophesy —a raise! tenure! - but do not read.  They have their own books to write.  She moves on to her next project, begins the process anew.  Then, three years later, she finds a 250-word review tucked in the back of an academic journal. This is proof, someone read her book! Someone who never engages her argument; neither praises nor condemns; and betrays little evidence of having made it past the introduction. Over the next few weeks she will acquire a passionate resistance to the confession that she had achieved nothing.&quot;</p></span>

White (1938)</strong> Apropos of nothing but The Modern Condition (Long-Obtaining), an extremely short work of dystopian fiction: Along about 1920 it became apparent that more things were being written than people had time to read. That is to say, even if a man spent his entire time reading stories, articles, and news, as they appeared in books, magazines, and pamphlets, he fell behind. This was no fault of the reading public; on the contrary, readers made a real effort to keep pace with writers, and utilized every spare moment during their walking hours. They read while shaving in the morning and while waiting for trains and while riding on trains. They came to be a kind of tacit agreement among numbers of the reading public that when one person laid down the baton, someone else must pick it up; and so when a customer entered a barbershop, the barber would lay aside the Boston Evening Globe and the customer would pick up Judge; or when a customer appeared in a shoe-shining parlor, the bootblack would put away the racing form and the customer would open his briefcase and pull out The Sheik. So there was always somebody reading something. Motormen of trolley cars read while they waited on the switch. Errand boys read while walking from the corner of Thirty-ninth and Madison to the corner of Twenty-fifth and Broadway. Subway riders read constantly, even when they were in a crushed, upright position in which nobody could read his own paper but everyone could look over the next man s shoulder. People passing newsstands would pause for a second to read headlines. Men in the back seats of limousines, northbound on Lafayette Street in the evening, switched on tiny dome lights and read the Wall Street Journal. Women in semi-detached houses joined circulating libraries and read Vachel Lindsay while the baby was taking his nap. There was a tremendous volume of staff that had to be read. Writing began to give off all sorts of by-products. Readers not only had to read the original works of a writer, but they also had to scan what the critics said, and they had to read the advertisements reprinting the favorable criticisms, and they had to read the book chat giving some rather odd piece of information about the writer such as that he could write only when he had a gingersnap in his mouth. It all took time. Writers gained steadily, and readers lost. Then along came the Reader's Digest. That was a wonderful idea. It digested everything that was being written in leading magazine, and put new hope in the hearts of readers. Here, everybody thought, was the answer to the problem. Readers, badly discouraged by the rate they had been losing ground, took courage and set out once more to keep abreast of everything that was being written in the world. For a while they seemed to hold their own. But soon other digests and short cuts appeared, like Time, and The Best...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/05/im_the_man_of_d.html"><span><strong>I'm the Man of Darwin's Dreams</strong> On 21 September 1838, Darwin transcribes the following into his &quot;M&quot; notebook: Was witty in a dream in a confused manner. Thought that a person was hung &amp; came to life, &amp; then made many jokes about not having run away &amp; having faced death, like a hero, &amp; then I had some confused idea of showing [the] scar behind (instead of front) (having changed hanging into his head cut off) as kind of wit showing he had honourable wounds. All this was kind of wit. I changed I believe from hanging to head cut off. There was the feeling of banter and joking because the whole train of Dr. Monro['s] experiment about hanging came before me showing [the] impossibility of person recovering from hanging on account of blood, but all these ideas came one after other, without ever comparing them. I neither doubted them or believed them. Believing consists in the comparison of ideas, connected with judgment. I like that I make an appearance in the &quot;M&quot; notebook, as it's the one in which Darwin tracks the moral and social consequences of the transmutation theory he's concurrently working out in the &quot;D&quot; notebook. In terms of world-historical import, I suppose the fact that he knew natural selection would have far-reaching implications is of paramount importance ... but what I most appreciate (outside my appearance as a heroic wit) is that Darwin believed the content of his dreams significant enough to record alongside his thoughts on Malthus' Essay on the Principle of Population, Comte's Positive Philosophy, and Hume's Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. This proves that were he alive today, Darwin would have a LiveJournal ... in which he would write about me. I can sleep easy tonight.</span></a></div>
