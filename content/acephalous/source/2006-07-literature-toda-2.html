	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/a_gift_part_ii_.html"><span><strong>A Gift, Part II: This Time, It's Illustrated</strong> I'm not going to put it on the site, but I want anyone in the mood for something brilliant to throw me a line and the benefit of the doubt. I've finished the first twelve issues of Warren Ellis's Planetary, and if you can stomach one egregiously lame &quot;revelation,&quot; I'm sure you'll agree it's the one of the best damned thing you've read in some time. You'll have to think to the left, the right, before and behind &quot;the box&quot; to do so, but I guarantee the effort'll be worth the reward. So if you're an honorable person who fancies novel stimuli, send me an email (at any of the addresses I haunt) and I'll send you a substantial something or other. IRONIC CODA: If you've sent me an email in the past three weeks and I have yet to respond, I apologize. Earlier this evening, I discovered approximately seventy emails in Gmail's spam folder which don't belong there. I'm in the process of responding, but have serious doubts about my stamina, so if you don't hear from me tonight, please don't add it to your tally of my inequities. I'm hard at type rehabilitating my good name, and the wonky vibes you'd be broadcasting could bring this whole show crashing down.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/on_gifts_such_o.html"><span><strong>On Gifts &amp; Such; or, Pathetic but Purposive Meta-Blogging, </strong> Adam may pummel me with righteous wit for this admission, but honestly, I didn't know how many readers I had. I estimated that the bulk of my 700 daily hits were random folks stumbling here from Google. Now that Google refuses to index Acephalous—for reasons they refuse to share with the likes of lowly me—I have a much more accurate estimate of my audience. To be frank, I'm floored. One of you (who requested anonymity) told me to check the number of people who subscribe to my feed—that is, the number of you who read below my radar. So I did. I'm overwhelmed. I mean it. Overwhelmed. I thought I'd get a couple of takers on last night's offer. Estimated fifteen, maybe twenty, people who'd be interested. And my TypePad account can handle a couple of people downloading a fourth of a gig each . . . . . . but it can't handle 153 (one-hundred and fifty-three!) requests.* I've sent as many of you as I currently can the gift I promised. I'm thinking of trying to send the rest via my Gmail account, but that'll only fly if I'm sending it to other Gmail accounts. So if you responded to last night's post but haven't heard back from me yet, please send me a Gmail address or one I can send a Gmail invite to. Because I feel terrible, not living up to my promise. But seriously, I'm also incredibly flattered. I didn't realize there were that many of you out there. I thought my ego inflated by a Googillusion. Turns out I was wrong. Which—the burdensome guilt notwithstanding—makes this whole enterprise feel commensurate to my (continued) investment in it. * That's actually a reference to Joyce. When he moved to Paris, he sent his family letters in which he emphasized his suffering by means of clever repetition. For example, a letter to his dying mother in which he writes &quot;Your order for 3s 4d of Tuesday last was very welcome as I had been without food for 42 hours (forty-two).&quot; I may've added some italics and an exclamation point, but that's only because 21st centurions are innoculated against the emphasis of simple, powerful repetition.</span></a></div>
