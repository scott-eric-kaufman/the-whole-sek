<p>Not really, of course.&nbsp; Only if <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0811205339/diesekoschmar-20">it’s postmodern</a> or <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=MeZPVaSa8lIC&amp;dq=%22the+real+america+in+romance%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=rTzLqkxqTc&amp;sig=4_06CbG2cSLoOFuQcsX5AhSXDh8&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPR8,M1">romantic</a>, and today it’s romantic.&nbsp; Edwin Markham’s <em>The Real America in Romance </em>(1909) sought to blend “authentic history and romance … to their mutual advantage.”&nbsp; His rationale:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here are set before us the examples of great men of
earth, men great in their patriotism and self-sacrifice; and side by
side with them are romantic characters typical of the times, men and
women only less great in their kindliness and unselfishness, all
affording a high expression of the art of Anglo-Saxon romance. Instead
of reading about historical characters and events, we see the persons
themselves in action, and live with them through the events of their
day and generation. The reader loses himself in the irresistible
fascination of the story, and the impressions resulting are made on the
heart as well as on the intellect.</p>
<p>You do not merely read about Columbus: you endure with him his
hardships, share with him his disappointments, rejoice with him in his
achievements. You actually feel the thrill of discovery when the New
World swims into his vision. Not content with telling you merely that
Washington wintered and suffered at Valley Forge with his army, the
author takes you straightway into the camp, shows you the torn and
bleeding feet of the soldiers, and makes you stand watch with the
half-fed sentries, with little to warm your blood except a fiery
determination to die of cold, hunger, or British bullets, rather than
give up the fight for your country.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s a single paragraph in the original, but I’ve sliced it up 1) <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/on_paragraph_le.html">because it’s overlong</a>,
and 2) to emphasize a rhetorical shift from “the reader” to “you.” 
What opens as a theory of literary affect quickly pivots into
admonishment — the reader who doesn’t endure, share, rejoice, winter,
suffer or stand watch isn’t merely a bad reader but unpatriotic.&nbsp; “If
you have fail to empathize with those who fought ‘for <em>your </em>country,’”
Markham as much as says, “you’re a terrible American.”&nbsp; He never
considers a reader might withhold sympathy not because he or she
possesses a paucity of patriotism, but because his bathetic prose
betrays an ear unworthy of enthused encomium.&nbsp; Consider the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WWA-yFBCy7EC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=VybmAwrKCX&amp;dq=markham+stars+and+stripes&amp;sig=ACfU3U1J7c7Y8APm5EzwMswiI45zVCUENg#PPA19,M1">first sentence of Volume IX, <em>The Stars &amp; Stripes</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A band of boys was abroad in the streets of Boston.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Scott, you say, happy accidents have happened heretofore! 
Granted.&nbsp; Now consider the first two sentences of the second paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>But it was not mirth nor mischief that brought them
forth to throng the streets.&nbsp; So much might have been inferred from
their eager and excited talk as they hurried over the flagging, covered
thinly with snow.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those alliterative pairs — “mirth nor mischief” and “eager and
excited” — bespeak a deliberately alliterative aesthetic agenda.&nbsp; <em>Still </em>don’t believe me?&nbsp; Turn to the twenty-first page and proceed to ponder this passage:</p>
<blockquote><p>Then the people, or such of them as did not feel the
restraint of the more orderly element, rose in riot.&nbsp; The answer to the
riot came in the shape of red-coated soldiers, two regiments of them,
under Colonel Dalrymple; and the appointment of hated Hutchinson, Tory
townsman, as lieutenant-governor.&nbsp; [...]&nbsp; Now the tension of nearly two
years had been drawn taut within three days, and peace thus strained
had snapped.</p></blockquote>
<p>The last phrase — “peace thus strained had snapped” — demonstrates
why authors aim alliterative for effect.&nbsp; (My last sentence, not so
much.)&nbsp; It is, in fact, a rather awesome example of alliterative
effect: the initial “s” links both words, but the long diphthong of
“strain” enacts a straining snapped by the short monothong of
“snapped.”&nbsp; However, since Markham’s every sentence subsists on said
diet, this felicitous phrase fails to find favor.</p>
<p>The reader turned off by Markham’s abusive alliteration isn’t unpatriotic <em>per se</em>, merely in possession of refinement and taste.&nbsp; But if the above hasn’t convinced you of Markham’s “talent,” try this:</p>
<blockquote><p>With a whoop, the band broke toward the sentinel.</p>
<p>“Kill him!” they cried.&nbsp; “Kill the bloody-backed scoundrel!”</p>
<p>They fell to pelting him with snowballs.</p>
<p>“The lobster is going to fire!” cried the lads, pressing closer.</p></blockquote>
<p>What happens when you pelt lobsters with snowballs?&nbsp; Death or <a href="http://fafblog.blogspot.com/"><em>Fafblog</em></a>.</p>

		<span id="comment-125206830-content"><p>I think the problem is that if you&#39;re studying anything more than a half-century old, Vance, all the best stuff has been taken, in that whenever you think that you&#39;re saying something new about it, all that you&#39;re really doing is accidentally repeating what some prior critic has written.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the attraction of brand-new theoretical approaches, of course.  All of a sudden you can re-visit the old standards.  But soon enough they&#39;ve all been re-done.</p>

<p>As you may have read on Acephalous sometime back, I&#39;m awaiting the natural extension of this phenomenon, Jo.  Jo is a grad student (or whatever their equivalent is) a few centuries from now, or whenever, when increasing population and education and who-knows-what expansion of mental capacity have led to not only the exhaustion of the good works of the past, but even of the crappier ones.  And of course, our era is one of the first really pickily archived ones.  At that point, Jo will be doing some sort of thesis on literary conversations at the turn of the 20th century, and will be picking over these comments: &quot;So who is Vance Maverick?  Can I identify this source?&quot;  Perhaps your comment above will head up one of Jo&#39;s chapters, or something.</p></span>

But this mentality must eventually exist, given enough time and variation and assuming no catastrophic breakdown in civilization.  After all, Scott is already reading Jack London&#39;s letters and whatnot.</p>

<p>Actually, I&#39;ll go out on a further predictive limb.  Assuming that someone archives these blog comments somehow, the first grad student to express interest in them will appear not centuries from now, but 30 years from now.</p></span>

On this day in 1927, a man whose Wikipedia entry was edited, via cell, from Minute Maid Park in the home half of the seventh was born. Television crews didn’t capture the edit, but they did capture the man himself as he waved feebly to the crowd of 38,602 baseball fans who applauded the infamous V-J Day celebrant on the occasion of his 81st birthday. How do I know? I was there. As luck would have it, not only was I there, I was seated next to a blogger. You’d think this was planned — Scott leaves house, “accidentally” meets blogger, bores wife with insider baseball for hours — but it wasn’t. Honest. But I digress. The octogenarian in question, Glenn McDuffie, has convinced forensic artists and lie detectors he should remembered as the sailor who stopped to kiss a stranger on his way to his girlfriend’s apartment.* How his girlfriend, Ardith Bloomfield of 555 Crown Street felt about his iconic act of infidelity isn’t only lost to history, but McDuffie too: he went to sea and never saw her again.** McDuffie’s not the only person to claim the mantle of Great American Osculator. He’s not even named as a potential candidate in the Life’s 1980 attempt to ferret the identities of the infamous kisser and kissee. When you think about it, it’s only fitting he celebrated his birthday at major sporting event, since major sporting events celebrate kissing for a minute or two every game.*** His kiss, however, has the benefit of inadvertant artfullness: Eisenstaedt’s photo is a perfect Renaissance perspective, with the foreground directly on the lower part of the bowtie, with big buildings converging diagonally toward the vanishing point, and a giant sign with a paternal figure promoting Ruppert Beer right on the point. This sailor and this nurse are surrounded by big buildings, by silver trolley tracks, by neon signs, and by the sky, but also by an assortment of other people. About twenty feet away there is a second sailor (and, in some croppings, a third), smiling on the couple. Another comment is suggested by the huge neon sign just to their right, which advertises BOND, then America’s biggest ready-made clothing store [...] The sign that proclaims the bond between this primal couple also highlights the more complex bonds that hold together the city, the country, maybe even the world. The other people in the picture are participants in the crowd’s festivities, but also, like ourselves, spectators of the couple’s embrace. They are both wearing uniforms, which mark them as “public servants” and separate them from the multitude of civilians (like ourselves) who surround them and whom they serve. His uniform is black, hers white. The contrast between them, sharpened by black-and-white film, heightens the clinch that binds them together. And the man responsible for this quintessential American photograph? A German Jewish refugee named Alfred Eisenstaedt whose previous claim to fame was a portrait of Goebbels the Nazi Propaganda Minister only found unflattering after...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/08/psa-my-shared-i.html"><span><strong>PSA: My &quot;Shared Items&quot;</strong> If you 1) use Google Reader for RSS and 2) have ever exchanged emails with me, you may be like the reader who sent me the following note: I admit defeat. I have no clue why you share what you share through Google Reader. Since neither rhyme nor reason guides your selections, I can only assume you're playing a schizophrenic in an online LARP to which I'm not privy. Not quite. The reason I share posts about bands I've never heard of, science I don't understand, theorists whose work baffles me, painfully cute cat hijinks, the physics of baseball, and the stupidity of prominent columnists is that I'm on some computer other than my desktop and want to revisit those posts when I'm on my main machine. (Ninety-percent of the time, I'm on my wife's laptop but want to download an .mp3 or two to the computer my .mp3 player syncs with.) If you'd rather not have my contingent list of random items appear in your RSS reader, you can &quot;hide&quot; me via this link. (Something's off about the use of &quot;hide&quot; there. The idea of you being able to hide me without my knowing about it is unsettling. I'm nobody's unwitting Anne Frank. You can't be discretely secreting me to annexes without my consent or, and this is the unsettling part, my not realizing you've done so. I'm nobody's unwitting Truman, either. But I digress.) If for some reason you want my mental ejecta cluttering up your RSS reader, you can subscribe to it via the same link. Honestly though, you have much better things to do with your time. I'm not even sure why you're reading this. You already know how to subscribe or unsubscribe, so these words—the ones you're currently, as in right now, reading—they're totally superfluous and you know it. So why are you still reading them? Too tired to Ctrl-w back to something sensible? Afflicted with dread textual inertia? Do you think maybe I'm building up to something funny, even though by now you're almost certain I'm not, but there's still a chance I am, and if I am you don't want to miss it? Rest easy, dear reader. Had you stopped, you wouldn't have missed a thing.</span></a></div>
