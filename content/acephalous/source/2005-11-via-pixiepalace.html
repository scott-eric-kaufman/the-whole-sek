I think the decision to make a comic book &quot;season&quot; of a show is very interesting as well.  I&#39;m hoping, given that the actual creators of the show are behind it, that this will turn out well.  I would love to see more things jump art form like this, especially since each medium has it&#39;s own advantages and disadvantages.  It&#39;s very interesting!</p>

<p>And I&#39;m still waiting for hoverboards too.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-11382216-content"><p>Another interesting fact is that IDW comics has already been producing <i>Angel</i> comics that take place after the end of the series (so far only Angel has been seen, but the next arc takes him back to L.A. so we&#39;ll get to see who survived) with storylines approved by Joss himself.</p>

<p>Generally, spin-offs like these aren&#39;t considered canon (for example, Paramount&#39;s official position is that all Star Trek books are &quot;apocrypal&quot;).</p>

<p>One exception are the Babylon 5 spin-off novels and comics, all of which (except one book and one comic arc) are more or less considered canon by series creator JMS - especially the ones that take place after the series, like the Technomage, Psi-Corps and Centauri Prime trilogies (since those later trilogies were based on outlines written by him and he read over and approved some of the drafts).</p>

<p>IIRC, Babylon 5 was the first series to really do this.  Up until now, even the Buffy and Angel comics were &quot;apocryphal&quot; - but now that Joss has a hand in them, they are turning into canonical sources.  (He also wrote a tale of futuristic slayer called &quot;Fray&quot; for Dark Horse comics that included elements he later brought into the TV series of Buffy.  The freaky axe Buffy uses to eviscerate the baddies in the last few episodes of the series?  In the comics first!)</p>

<p>There was even a three issue Firefly/Serenity comic series by Dark Horse comics that bridged the gap between the TV series and the Movie and which was co-written by Joss.</p>

<p>Amazing how long this has been going on, no?</p></span>

<p>One day, when we&#39;re all wealthy and famous enough to influence scientific research, we&#39;ll all ride hoverboards together.</p>

<p>John,</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what this thing you call <i>Fray</i> is, but that&#39;s only because I&#39;ll never admit to reading comic books in public . . . in other words, of course you&#39;re right, but at the same time, there is something unique about what Joss is doing now.  By which I mean, I haven&#39;t read any of the <i>B5</i> apocrypha, even though I&#39;ve watched the entire series, but I consider most of what&#39;s been written illegitimate apocrypha . . . and that&#39;s what I think is unique about Joss&#39; proposal.  He&#39;s saying that the same people responsible for the show we cherish will run the comic, and I think that&#39;s a significant difference.  JMS may stamp his approval on elaborations of <i>B5</i>, but Joss is about to write another season of <i>Buffy</i>, scripts and all, only in a different format . . . and that&#39;s what I find ground-breaking.  </p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re obviously correct to say that I&#39;m coming to this late in the game, but better late than never, no?  (I don&#39;t mean that to sound confrontational.  The thing is that I&#39;ve been a bit busy writing that whole &quot;dissertation thing,&quot; and haven&#39;t had the time to pursue that which I&#39;m interested in on the side.  By which I mean, I <i>do</i> know what this thing called <i>Fray</i> is, and where that axe comes from, but I won&#39;t admit as much unless I&#39;m . . . nevermind.  Nothing to see here. Move along, move along.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-11383073-content"><p>I think that comics had their brief day as independent art form, and are now becoming sleeping or larval forms of other types of art.  Marvel and DC probably no longer make very much on their comics compared to how much they make from movies or TV shows based on them.  Joss can continue a cancelled TV show in comics until it one day moves to something else.  Other comics are quickly becoming more profitable when bound into graphic novels and sold as books in bookstores than in their original form of release.</p></span>

Weir Mitchell: Writerly Writer &amp; Doctorly Doctor</strong> I'm working on the fiction of Silas Weir Mitchell—remembered as the leading proponent of &quot;the rest cure&quot; memorialized in &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot;—and today I hit the stacks to grab a copy of his biography. The one I found, S. Weir Mitchell: Novelist and Physician, is a true truthful account of the experiences experienced by the really real Mitchell during the life he lived alive . . . as recounted by his biographer Ernest Earnest. In a 1952 review of Earnest's biography, Erwin H. Ackerknecht stated, seemingly without irony, that The book is earnestly, though not very well, written.

Turns out I hit on a variation of the perfect business model: Collect underpants. ??? Profit! The way Amazon Associates works is simple: if you click through to Amazon from Acephalous and place some junk in your shopping trunk, 4% of whatever you end up spending gets deposited in my now overflowing coffers. Since that Typepad Tip Jar strikes me as crass capitalism, I want to float the following idea: if you're a loyal reader, appreciate what I write here and are going to make a purchase through Amazon anyway, why not click here first and help a starving grad. student starve a little less. Granted, maybe &quot;starve&quot; is too strong a word . . . so how about &quot;inebriated&quot; instead? (As in &quot;Help an inebriated grad. student drink a little more?&quot;) Full disclosure: I only say this because there's something slimy about my having set this up and y'all &quot;contributing&quot; to the site without knowing it for the past few months. I'm all about transparency and guilt. Crippling guilt.</span></a></div>
