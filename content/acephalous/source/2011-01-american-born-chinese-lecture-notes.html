Most students claim that it is better to be a robot who can turn into a car then a car that can turn into a robot, and the fact that I used the relative pronoun &quot;who&quot; to refer to the robot and &quot;that&quot; to refer to the car betrays why: the robot is seen to have greater agency even though it still thinks, is still sentient, as a car.

<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e22ad9f5970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Abc12" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e22ad9f5970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e22ad9f5970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Abc12" /></a> <br />To undergo this transformation, Jin Wang must &quot;forfeit [his] soul,&quot; which indicates fairly strongly that his essential identity is Chinese and points to what I think is a central problem with this book: it can easily be mistaken as an argument in favor of identitarian politics.&#0160; Map the moment-to-moment transition in that panel there back onto the Transformer metaphor and it is clearly better to be a vanilla robot than a robot who can transform into a car because a vanilla robot still possesses its soul, whereas a transforming robot has forfeited its.&#0160; I don&#39;t actually think that&#39;s a tenable reading of the book, but it&#39;s certainly a palpable one when, for example, your student population consists largely of Asian-American students whose parents have insisted on the cultural superiority of the Asian half of that equation for their entire young lives.&#0160; The reason I don&#39;t find the superior-of-the-still-ensouled-robot reading defensible is that these same students sympathize strongly with Wang; that is, they prefer their culture to that of their parents.&#0160;</p>
<p>Except their culture isn&#39;t the lily white &quot;American&quot; one that Yang offers as an alternative to the &quot;Asian.&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s profoundly hybrid.&#0160; Yang understands this, as is evident from the fact that the typical &quot;American&quot; storyline—which interleaves with a repurposing of <em>Journy to the West </em>and Wang&#39;s bildungsroman—initially and explicitly bills itself as a sitcom called:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c834364b970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Abc20" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c834364b970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c834364b970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Abc20" /></a> <br />Now it should be fairly obvious why I brought up <em>Maus</em>.&#0160; As Yang himself <a href="http://www.firstsecondbooks.com/authors/geneYangBlogMain.html" target="_self">puts it</a>: &quot;What would possess a self-respecting Asian-American cartoonist to draw a character like that?&quot;&#0160; His own answer to to his rhetorical question strikes me as less of an answer than a dodge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve been told that Jeff Smith, the genius behind the  cartoon epic <em>Bone</em>, first created Fone Bone and Company in kindergarten.  In many ways, Cousin Chin-Kee is my Bone. He&#39;s a character conceived in  childhood who&#39;s stayed with me ever since, consciously or not.</p>
<p><em>American Born Chinese</em> is an exploration of<strong><em> why</em></strong> Cousin  Chin-Kee is my Bone. And just as Fone Bone now looks much the way he did  in Jeff Smith&#39;s kindergarten sketches, so Chin-Kee&#39;s current design  remains consistent with that initial second grade drawing. I&#39;ve got to  stay true to the source material.</p>
<p>There is always the danger, of course, that by making a comic book about  Cousin Chin-Kee I&#39;m helping to perpetuate him, that readers—especially younger readers—will take his appearance in <em>American Born  Chinese</em> at face value. I think it&#39;s a danger I can live with. In order  for us to defeat our enemy, he must first be made visible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The discussion of <em>Bone </em>seems a bit beside the point, and that last sentence suggests that Chin-Kee is &quot;our&quot; enemy and must be defeated.&#0160; But who are the &quot;we&quot; behind that &quot;our&quot; and how are &quot;we&quot; defeating him?&#0160; The question of audience, always an issue, looms even larger here: if &quot;we&quot; are about half of the students at UCI, &quot;we&quot; are first-generation Asian-Americans who can sympathize with Yang&#39;s desire to represent their experiences; if &quot;we&quot; are the general comic book reading community, &quot;we&quot; are a far more heterogeneous group; and if &quot;we&quot; are everybody in my &quot;Confessional Narratives&quot; course, &quot;we&quot; are a heady combination of the two.&#0160; When members of the second group comment on the book, the members of the first often feel like their cultural experience is being co-opted.&#0160; Moreover, most students laughed at the following panel in the privacy of their solitary reading experience, but none will admit it in the classroom:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c8344edf970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Abc04" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c8344edf970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c8344edf970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Abc04" /></a> <br />In short, class discussion is fraught, and the only way to work within that tense atmosphere is to encourage the students to discuss what they can: word-picture relations, panel transitions, film terminology, etc.&#0160; Once they start to impute the intention behind the formal elements to Yang instead of their own (imagined or otherwise) implicit racism, the tension wanes enough to return the conversation to the earlier topic: which element of a hyphenated identity is primary.&#0160; In the character of Chin-Kee, students who argue (often on the basis of the third panel above) that it&#39;s the Asian element are confronted with what Yang may believe that unadulterated Asianness looks like.&#0160; That&#39;s a harsh but not entirely unwarranted assessment, because as Yang himself <a href="http://www.firstsecondbooks.com/authors/geneYangBlogMain.html" target="_self">contends</a>, his &quot;second-grade self [may have] identified with [a] Chinese caricature&quot; he had drawn as a child.&#0160; That caricature, the basis of Chin-Kee, may be his perception of himself or his perception of other people&#39;s perception of him, which would make the caricature a visible manifestation of Yang&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_consciousness" target="_self">double consciousness</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>Or Yang is an unrepetant old-school racist, though the fact that [<em>spoiler alert</em>] Chin-Kee is actually the Monkey King from narrative that borrows from and builds on <em>The Journey to the West</em> somewhat undermines that line of argument.&#0160; You&#39;ll note that this entire conversation fails to address why they laughed at that panel in private but refuse to admit to doing so in public, but it needn&#39;t: it&#39;s just the bog-simple fear of being caught thinking something racist.&#0160; It&#39;s much easier to call someone else a racist than to confront the fruit of one&#39;s own unthinking racism.&#0160; What&#39;s interesting to someone who&#39;s studied race for years (and has taught multiple courses on race and literature) is just how deeply rooted this fear is.&#0160; The amount of intellectual labor required for me to circumvent it is dwarfed by the amount of intellectual labor they perform in order to avoid confronting it.&#0160; Note how little formal analysis I&#39;ve done in this post: I&#39;ve alluded to it, but that&#39;s about it, because I guarantee that it&#39;ll take the majority of the class just to reach this point.</p>

<p>Someone said something which reminded me of just how fraught discussions of race, and Asian-American identities in particular can be. I was just drunk enough to think this was a great topic for discussion, but not so drunk that I seemed to make sense.</p>

<p>The FoaFoaF suddenly unleashed a wave of irony and satire worthy of Doug Piranha. It was layer-upon-layer, bitterness ameliorated by whimsy edged by anger. It was a beautiful thing, and all these years later, I am still awed. </p>

<p>I stammered, apologized, and changed the subject.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e2307133970b-content"><p>I don&#39;t see it as so much of a dodge. He also points out that he actually looks more like the more stereotypical image of a Chinese kid and that he placed himself in the story not as that kid, but as a different image that seems to be moving away from the stereotypical image as well. So not drawing himself as he really looked needs to be balanced by taking on that stereotypical image</p>

<p>As a half sansei who now lives in Japan, I certainly may have a viewpoint that is different from what your students have, but I think that the image minorities (by which I mean the exclusive &#39;we&#39; rather than an inclusive &#39;we&#39;) have of them/ourselves is often an image that is pushed on them/us by the majority culture. What precisely that image is can be very difficult to define, but it often, necessarily, partakes of earlier, undeniably racist images. This is because those images are floating around (think Crouching Dragon, Hidden Tiger, or Rush Hour for Chinese), and it is difficult to imagine them somehow just disappearing. So I think it is a bit harsh to call it &#39;the fruit of one&#39;s own unthinking racism&#39;. It is not as if one can somehow erase those images, and even harder when they are still in the air. Given that the images carry a certain weight and imply a range of unacceptable stereotypes, laughing at them in private, but decrying them in public makes more sense than to somehow completely reject them (which seems impossible) or to totally embrace them (which does seem racist). Also, when I think of what my self image was when I was at university (and it is by no means sorted out now), &#39;unthinking&#39; is precisely the wrong term to use. It was thought about a lot, and the point that your students are laughing in private but are refusing to admit it in public can be attributed not to them not thinking about it, but to them trying to find out where precisely it fits in their lives. They may not be able to put exactly what they are thinking about into words, but it doesn&#39;t mean that it is not occupying their thoughts.</p>

<p>Rereading this, you may be making the point that non Chinese laugh in private but refuse to acknowledge that in public. Yet saying that a chinese-american student can laugh at it, but a white student cannot (I think there might be a different problem if we are talking about the creation of the character) seems to restrict the appreciation of what Yang has created to a minority, which doesn&#39;t see right.</p></span>

But I disagree that Chang&#39;s intentions are unclear -- students will be wary of trying to articulate why this is okay to laugh at, but they are laughing because they get the irony, even if they don&#39;t have the critical vocabulary to describe the irony. The laugh track represented by the words along the bottom of the panel makes the ironic intent very clear, if the extreme exaggeration and sitcom setting weren&#39;t enough. The satire is clear enough that it shouldn&#39;t surprise them too much when the racist caricature transforms into a trickster god. (Okay, I know that expecting students to get irony is a dangerous thing, but I guess I mean that most of them take irony for what it is <i>until you ask them to interpret it in class</i>, at which point they get afraid and come up with the most literal surface interpretation they can).</p>

<p><i>Maus</i> is a lot harder to pin down, I think. I tell students that the words and pictures are conveying two separate messages, and that they have to notice how the two channels conflict. The pictures show us a racist vision, and the words humanize the characters. The oversimplification that Artie worries about can now be blamed on the racist culture all the characters exist in, rather than on limitations of the medium. We can read a great message about how cultural frames are pervasive and nearly invisible, but the ironic moments that lead us to that reading are a whole lot more subtle and hard to bring forward to students.</p></span>

<p>This is also as true in this general form: &quot;The two problems that confront any author&quot; of fiction or POV narrative, and then apply Spiegleman&#39;s dialogue as posted.  </p>

<blockquote> In short: how are painful memories and painfully stereotypical people best represented in a medium associated with childishness?</blockquote>

<p>This is, of course, the more specific topic you&#39;re addressing, and then there are the cultural issues you drive at, but I note the more general case.</p>

<p>On a similar note: <blockquote> Except their culture isn&#39;t the lily white &quot;American&quot; one that Yang offers as an alternative to the &quot;Asian.&quot;  It&#39;s profoundly hybrid. </blockquote> I note that, as you know, but we all must write in shorthand, the &quot;lily white &#39;American&#39;&quot; culture is thoroughly hybrid, despite various narratives, and this is also why politics is so difficult.  </p>

<p>And inter-human communication in general.  </p>

<p>We all can only communicate across commonalities.  And since I don&#39;t teach, that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing here myself.  :-)</p>

<blockquote> In short, class discussion is fraught </blockquote> In short, all discussion is fraught, including our interior monologues/dialogues, etc., depending upon how settled we are with ourselves, but then we go to questions of being inwardly peaceful yet able to deal with the constant inward change necessary to deal with a an every more dynamically accelerating rate of change in our external circumstances.

<p>I note that how people relate to the internet and being high information or low information tends to directly correlate, in my observation, with how much change they are able to deal with in their own lives, and therefore how much change they are able to make in dealing with external circumstances such as back to the rate of change of technology, including communications techology and social media, so once again I&#39;m also making a meta comment on the very means we&#39;re using to communicate here, when we might also be doing so via Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal, LinkedIn, telephone, omg, snailmail, video chats, meatspace, and so on.</p>

<p>Someone was telling me last night how &quot;the blogging moment is over&quot; and... we all only see that which is around us and that which we are able to find time to explore.</p>

<p>I do this including by reading your great stuff on your blog, even though I can&#39;t attend your class.  Which is just as well, because I&#39;d probably be trying to read stuff on some mobile device at the same time, and write comments to you on one of your other written publishing platforms. :-)</p>

<p>I&#39;m also reminded of another paradox I ran into recently wherein a leftist friend was expressing a view of localism and community that seemed to me to inevitably lead on a direct chain of logic that winds up with nationalism and racism.  There are other aspects I won&#39;t explain, but a reason I&#39;m throwing this in is because he&#39;s Chinese-American.  </p>

<p>And also was explaining to me why jobs should stay in America and not India.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how I should explain that to my Indian friends, or how this is a sound leftish position, but, then, we all have views that contradict, and contain multitudes.</p>

<p>Now I may go say hi to you on Facebook.  Toodles.</p></span>

<p>We all do our own variants of this.  The best solution, I think, which I of course, rarely follow, is to not announce any intents of follow up at all, and either they happen or they won&#39;t, or to announce that you&#39;ll either find time later to respond or not, we&#39;ll all find out together, or, perhaps, go look for one&#39;s misplaced car.  </p>

<p>Or write another post.  Or go to Facebook, or write email, or do one of your other blogs, or go read something, or stop and smell the flowers, or say hi to your wife, or do something more amusing and relaxing, and Go To Your Happy Place, briefly.  </p>

<p>But it&#39;s a waste of time to post announcements of intent when it&#39;s too likely to not happen, and then to apologize.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m all about the efficiency, and also pissing people off with unwanted advice about how to improve their lives and everything else.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll follow up this comment in an hour.</p></span>

I can put zombies in people's heads?&quot;</strong> Such was the reaction of my students after I informed them of their murdering ways and asked them to tell me what happens in the gutter between the first two panels. Needless to say, teaching The Walking Dead will be directly responsible for me hearing countless things I never thought I'd hear in a classroom.</span></a></div>

Given that the comic on which it's based alternates between menacingly quiet moments and long stretches of extreme chattiness, it may be a mistake to think about the tone in a singular fashion; however, the fact that these two tonal elements could be characterized as &quot;opposites&quot; means that the opening scene of the series will have to choose one or the other. Director Frank Darabont not only decided on quiet menace, he emphasized the future significance of silence by turning down the diagetic sound and eschewing non-diagetic sound entirely. The result? The series introduces itself to the world with a unusually quiet establishing shot of a car approaching the camera on a deserted road: As the car nears, the camera tracks it and Darabont uses the resulting tracking shot to create the impression that the person behind the camera is hiding behind the car. The camera pulls back until the burnt wreck in the foreground nearly obscures the patrol car, only to pan right at the conclusion of the long take and reveal that its &quot;hiding place&quot; has been compromised. In short, the camera seems to be hiding from the patrol car, which strongly suggests to the audience that there's something to hide from and that it may be in that patrol car. As if to emphasize that potential danger in the car, Darabont moves the camera-spy-without-a-hiding-place further away from the patrol car before cutting away: Even after the cut away, the camera still behaves as if the mind behind it wants to remain hidden while scoping out a better hiding place. It begins behind and to the right of the burnt wreck and tracks to the back and to the left as Rick Grimes moves toward it. The resulting shot keeps Rick occupying the center of a long shot until the camera knows he can be trusted: Or until it knows Rick either can't see him or can but doesn't care. Rick's eyes scan the area occupied by the camera but never directly addresses it. Initially, this means he's not a threat; eventually, and as anyone who's had a long conversation with someone who refuses to make eye contact with you well-knows, when sustained over time it will create the impression that Rick may not be worthy of the audience's trust. And it is sustained over time via another long take: Note how the camera seems to be following from the front in what almost seems to be a point-of-view shot from the perspective of someone walking backwards down a steep hill, adding to the generally suspicious tenor of the previous shot another possible means of inflicting bodily harm: falling. The steadiness of the camera only adds to the tension: because audiences have come to expect shakiness from their realism, the calmness of Darabont's camerawork creates the...</span></a></div>
