		<span id="comment-81174283-content"><p>Van Vechten&#39;s portraits are indeed amazing. I once worked in a library that housed a large collection of them, and it was sometimes my task to photocopy them. A kind curator sometimes gave me 8x10 glossies when they&#39;d reproduced more than a scholar needed--I still have one of Zora Neale Hurston and one of Edna St. Vincent Millay.</p>

<p>But the ones that really both fascinated and freaked me out (I was pretty young at the time) were the photos of young men: sometimes black, somtimes white, sometimes both, but always stark naked and often erect, posed among various tribal masks and statuettes.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-81183625-content"><p>His portraitures are easy to spot. They have goofy characters, goofy backgrounds, and a kind of goofy soft-glow to them. Carl Van Vechten basically photographed everyone I would avoid. Vechten was secretly against his subjects, and took mug shots disguised as artfully composed photographs so future generations could damn them, knowing full well the punishment of eternal hate was worse than anything immediate. </p>

<p>Well, that last bit is just a small theory. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-81200301-content"><p>There&#39;s something both wonderful and awful in these.  Awful in the arbitrary and distracting backgrounds (Jesus Christ, are those marionettes behind Truman Capote?), the poor control over lighting and exposure, the simplistic framing.  Wonderful in that, despite the formulaic poses, they capture something about their subjects that usually doesn&#39;t show up in portraits.  Almost like a vision of what they are thinking as they wait for the photo to be taken.</p>

<p>It&#39;s great to see Baldwin looking so young.  It made me pull my copy of <i>The Price of the Ticket</i> off the shelf and realize how many of my favorite essays of his are from this period.  He looks so much more (understandably) world-weary a decade later, which is how I always visually think of him.<br />

Why do you ask?</strong> The aforementioned mensch writes: Sure, Kaufman might be a master of self-victimizing schemes. But look at his blog. Doesn't fit. Hate to disagree, but a good long gander at this blog strongly indicates otherwise. Since I began blogging, I've caught students having sex in my office and became entangled in a sexual harassment lawsuit. received death threats from an unstable and sorrowful troll who lives less than an hour away. been cyber-stalked by an insane sports writer from Wisconsin out to ruin my career. been accused of criminal pettiness for observing someone else's criminal pettiness. had that other thing happen in the comments thread of that other blog, which led to this, among other vile things. I've brought all this upon myself in two years. I may be the most successful self-victimizer the internet has even seen. I attract more (absurd) scandal in a week than the average blogger does in the course of his or her entire blogging career. I demand credit where it's due. I've worked hard, damn it, and deserve a cookie. I want my damn cookie. I demand a damn cookie. If someone don't give me one soon, someone is gonna find himself subscribed to a couple hundred more conservative listservs come morning.</span></a></div>

The Internet Provides Me Cookies!</strong> John once wrote about &quot;blogging getting results,&quot; but he never imagined this. This afternoon, the cookies I so desperately desired were delivered to my door. Todd. was true to his word, providing the wife and I with delicious chocolate-mint-raisin cookies. (Sisyphus can consider her lack of cookies a just punishment for the water which fell from her heavens. Cookies are divine, but as Todd. and I discussed this afternoon, some weather would be nice.) I can't thank him enough ... although I feel obliged to apologize for the state of my 1) (patchy) beard, 2) book-littered apartment, and 3) dissertation-preoccupied mind. At three in the afternoon, all my thoughts are belong to Twain.</span></a></div>
