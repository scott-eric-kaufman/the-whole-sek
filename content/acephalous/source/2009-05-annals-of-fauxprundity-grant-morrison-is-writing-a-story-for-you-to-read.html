Coyete</a>.)&#0160; Moreover, the consequences of this meta-fictional interaction work within the confines the of the narrative: Buddy Baker had been distraught over the murder of his wife and children, and as a result of his conversation with Morrison, they are resurrected (none the wiser for their grisly murders) and returned to him by the end of the issue.&#0160; The narrative ruptures draw attention to the conventional features of comics as a genre.&#0160; They differ in degree from the sort of formal ruptures all comics employ:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f6f3bb0970c-pi"><img alt="Animal_man_02a" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f6f3bb0970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f6f3bb0970c-500pi" title="Animal_man_02a" /></a> </p><p style="text-align: left;">The rock breaks through the panel and lands somewhere else on the page.&#0160; Happens all the time to comic projectiles: they bust through one panel to do violence in another.&#0160; I&#39;m all for formal experimentation.&#0160; Just last week I <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/because-of-course-jack-london-sucks-harder-than-many-comics.html">wrote</a> (without the emphasis) that &quot;if a close-reading reveals that a work <em>flirts</em> with the formal elements
of its genre or genres—whatever they may be—that work should be
canonized.&quot;&#0160; Only Morrison has devoted the last two decades to an increasingly aggressive flirtation with convention regardless of whether his advances were warranted.&#0160; Put differently: </p><p style="text-align: left;">Most readers hold to a folk theory of artistic development whereby the longer an author writes, the more complicated his or her work becomes.&#0160; So the young Joyce writes clever realist sucker-punches in <em>Dubliners</em>; experiments his way through <em>Stephen Hero </em>into the introspective of <em>Portrait</em>; transcends the lyricism of the final pages of <em>Portrait</em> alongside stately, plump Buck Mulligan in the &quot;Telemachiad&quot; and spends the rest of that novel (<em>Ulysses</em>) and the next (<em>Finnegans Wake</em>) outdoing what he did the day before.&#0160; By that light, the fact that Morrison now writes about how that rock&#39;s<em> complicit in a conspiracy to break not just through the panel but <strong>through the very page itself</strong> because perception of the two-dimensional fictional world in which it exists blends with the three-dimensional perceptual systems by which we come to understand that fictional world <strong>in our minds</strong></em> demonstrates the evolution of his particular brand of genius.&#0160; But his pursuit of this meta-fictional prey has been so singular as to override all other narrative concerns.&#0160; Had Joyce wanted to write another &quot;Araby&quot; in 1928 he would not have written it in Wakese because the form would overwhelm the story&#39;s slight content.&#0160; </p><p style="text-align: left;">At the present moment, Morrison is so unconcerned with such matters that he subjugates supremely non-slight material to his meta-fictional concerns: Batman does not die in <em>Batman R.I.P.</em>&#0160;&#0160; He gets clipped by the Omega Sanction (&quot;THE DEATH THAT IS LIFE!&quot;) and forced into a feedback loop of simultaneous reincarnation in which he will face hardships again and again and again for all eternity and if that sounds an awful lot like what a character featured in multiple monthly comics (<em>Batman</em>, <em>Detective Comics</em>, <em>Batman and Robin</em>, <em>Batman: Streets of Gotham</em>, <em>Superman/Batman</em>, <em>Batman Confidential</em>, <em>Batman and the Outsiders</em>, <em>Trinity</em>, <em>Justice League of America</em>, <em>All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder</em>, and <em>Batman: The Brave and the Bold</em>) then you&#39;ve been paying attention.</p><p style="text-align: left;">I&#39;ll reward you for it (and be a little more charitable to Morrison) tomorrow.</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01157065e8f4970b-content"><p>&quot;Because in the end every Grant Morrison story is about Grant Morrison writing stories. &quot;</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t read 70% of Morrison&#39;s bibliography -- mostly I&#39;ve read Animal Man, Doom Patrol, and a few smaller Vertigo things -- but that was his formative period.  And what I think that you&#39;re missing is that writing superhero comics that are about yourself writing stories was transformed by Vertigo into a sort of comics subgenre.  It becomes something more than an individual artistic rut; it&#39;s more like taking John Le Carre and asking why he doesn&#39;t stop writing spy novels.</p>

<p>Even considering it as subgenre, would James Joyce get stuck like that?  No.  But no one in comics is James Joyce.</p>

<p>But you have to take it seriously that Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, and Grant Morrison -- three of comics&#39; best writers, I&#39;d say -- all like to do variations of the same thing.  That has to turn it into something more than Morrison&#39;s individual tic.</p></span>

<p>1) What about We3?  That, I think, has to be said as being something other than Morrison writing about Morrison.  I lot of people think it&#39;s one of his best works (I&#39;d put it on tier two, I think, but it&#39;s good (albeit, yeah, sentimental.))</p>

<p>2) What about Morrison&#39;s humor?  One of the reasons I like Doom Patrol so much is that it&#39;s just so damn funny.  I mean, the Brotherhood of *Dada*? Holy Dr. Pepper instead of Holy Water?</p>

<p>3) I&#39;m curious if you&#39;ve read Marc Singer&#39;s late, lamented blog (link here: <a href="http://notthebeastmaster.typepad.com/weblog/" rel="nofollow">http://notthebeastmaster.typepad.com/weblog/</a> ).  He&#39;s one of the best writers on Morrison I know, and I&#39;m curious what you&#39;d make of him.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not missing that at all: what I&#39;m identifying as a problem is the fact that he seems trapped in that period.  </p>

<p><em>It becomes something more than an individual artistic rut; it&#39;s more like taking John Le Carre and asking why he doesn&#39;t stop writing spy novels.</em></p>

<p>Or why he won&#39;t stop writing variations of the same spy novel.</p>

<p><em>But you have to take it seriously that Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, and Grant Morrison -- three of comics&#39; best writers, I&#39;d say -- all like to do variations of the same thing. That has to turn it into something more than Morrison&#39;s individual tic.</em></p>

<p>They&#39;ve all explored it, but none so tenaciously (or exclusively) as Morrison.  What I&#39;ve half-written for today addresses this via a comparison between Morrison&#39;s <em>Batman R.I.P.</em> and Gaiman&#39;s <em>What Ever Happened to the Caped Crusader?</em>  Gaiman knows the difference between the story being the story and the story being a story, as with the prelude to <em>Doll&#39;s House</em>, for example.  The act of storytelling needs foregrounding on occasion, not all occasions.  There&#39;s a joylessness to reading a Morrison story in which the characters never become more than characters <em>even within their own fiction</em>.  </p>

<p><em>What about We3? That, I think, has to be said as being something other than Morrison writing about Morrison. I lot of people think it&#39;s one of his best works</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m going to address this later, but material like <em>We3</em> works because it&#39;s bounded (the same holds for the first 10 issues of <em>All Star Superman</em>); but when DC gives him the keys to the entire kingdom and he takes it upon himself to tackle every continuity error in all its glorious erroneousness, he spins wildly out of control.  I&#39;ve just started going through that blog---which, damn it, of course I found after it went dark---but I love this:</p>

<blockquote>All this could be forgiven if the series added up to something more than a sheaf of character designs and continuity notes for a story that gets outlined rather than told. </blockquote>

<p>That hints at 1) why academic-oriented comic-folk are attracted to him and 2) why his recent work reads so joyless.  But now I&#39;m going to spend the morning reading through Singer&#39;s blog.  Thanks a lot, Frug!  (No, seriously, thanks a lot.  Great stuff that is.)  One last note:</p>

<p><em>What about Morrison&#39;s humor? One of the reasons I like Doom Patrol so much is that it&#39;s just so damn funny. I mean, the Brotherhood of *Dada*? Holy Dr. Pepper instead of Holy Water?</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s disappeared, hasn&#39;t it?  The <em>Doom Patrol</em> material&#39;s damn funny at times, as is <em>Animal Man</em>, but it&#39;s also occasionally poignant and moving, and his recent stuff isn&#39;t either of those either.  In fact, he&#39;s far too quick to stuff King Mob-style exposition in Superman&#39;s mouth for five panels and that just doesn&#39;t work.</p></span>

<p>My theory, based on Animal Man / Doom Patrol, is that Morrison&#39;s problem is with narrative as such.  At the end of even a Vertigo run, there&#39;s a tying-up gesture.  Morrison really isn&#39;t about that, so his tying-up gestures end up being escapes into metanarrative.  Making it about Morrison writing stories means that it can&#39;t end, at least not while he&#39;s still writing stories.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f735cd7970c-content"><p>Your comment may be a bit too cryptic for me to understand, Ahistoricality, but I think by &quot;variations of the same thing&quot; you&#39;re referring back to my mention of the Vertigo syndrome.   I don&#39;t understand how 1001 Arabian Nights really does this.  Do the people in the stories ever Scheherazade ever interrupt or end their stories by themselves acknowledging Scheherazade as their creator?  There&#39;s a big difference between bumping things up to to the top level (i.e. saying &quot;This is a story, and you&#39;re not going to hear the end of it until tomorrow&quot;) and making the top level pervade all the others (i.e. having Scheherazade appear within the stories and stories-within-stories, having perhaps a story-within-story end by the character saying &quot;But Scheherazade has pleased the king now, so there&#39;s no need for my story to go on -- my life stops here&quot;).</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between a storyteller and a demiurge.  The demiurge, in this kind of fiction:</p>

<p>* often appears as a character;<br />
* works out more or less obviously their own writing problems through their characters;<br />
* meditates on their flaws as a creator.</p>

<p>For instance, the <i>Sandman</i> issue where Dr. Dee torments four characters at a diner.  Dee is a stand-in for Gaiman, and the issue is about his distaste that the kind of writing that he does requires melodramatic horror (among other things).  That&#39;s established pretty well by the text itself, his comments on it, and so on, but most certainly by the opening sequence where a waitress muses on what stories she would write about the people there if she were a writer -- she&#39;d give them all happy lives.  The rest of the issue implicit says that that would be boring -- or, at least, not suitably dramatic enough for the genre -- and that what people want, or at least all that Gaiman knows how to make them want, is people being tormented.  It&#39;s really a touchstone issue for the Vertigo writers, I think.</p></span>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Actually I have a half-baked theory about the aforementioned Britpunk comics writers&#39; obsessive &quot;coolness == illusion-shattering narrative transcendence&quot; bullshit, with King Mob and the super-white fella from <em>Planetary</em> and Moore&#39;s Constantine and the Hunter Semi-Thompson from <em>Transmetropolitan</em> being basically identical embodiments of the same impulse that produces endless variations on the same &#39;everything is connected&#39; freshman-dorm <em>Illuminatus!</em> knockoff (RAW R.I.P.) <em>and</em> Morrison&#39;s disdain for the medium&#39;s genre norms, but fuck it, I&#39;m back from a Catholic wedding in Chicago and need to go punch a child, tell you later man.<br />

<p><em>To what extent can you ignore this if the story works on its own terms</em></p>

<p>Excellent point, and sort of what I was getting at with <em>Animal Man</em>, which did work on its own terms: I don&#39;t think we can ignore the meta-fictional elements when the story works, I think we <em>do</em> ignore them (at least to the extent that they don&#39;t actively annoy us).  </p>

<p>Wally, I&#39;ll deal with you shortly.</p>

<p>Martin:</p>

<p><em>I can&#39;t help but feel that much of what Morrison has been doing as a writer working on these big DC universe projects the last five years or so is driven by boredom at the standard superhero story, that his flight into meta-textuality is an escape from having to take Batman seriously as a character.

<p>I don&#39;t think Moore slummed on <em>Supreme</em>: he was genuinely interested in futzing around with Superman more than DC ever let him, so he took the opportunity when Liefeld offered it.  (Though I hope the script included specific directions for the number and placement of feet.)  Nor do I think Morrison&#39;s particularly bored by the genre --- seems more like the opposite, like he&#39;s addicted to and regularly overdoses on it.  I&#39;m still working on that other Morrison post, though, and I&#39;ll address this some more in it.</p></span>

I think you can get to the bottom of his usage of the device by understanding he&#39;s a sigil magician. He wrote an article for Disinformation about sigil magic and why it&#39;s the best kind of pop-culture/corporate magic. By using his works as a canvas for his sigils, he implants tulpas into the minds of all readers and draws power(or something else?) from them. Usually they are pictographic but can be a repeated succession of words like a mantra. He often describes Invisibles as a hypersigil. The metatexual device is just him describing what he&#39;s doing to the reader. He talks about this a bunch in his discussion panels as well.<br />
As to the validity of sigils? I&#39;ve never tried it, but a great number of western esotericists and occultists throughout the ages have stood by this sort of magic. Buddhist and qigong masters acknowledge it but say that it is a low form of magic, the stuff of ordinary people, but not necessarily demonic or black magic.</p></span>

See how they laugh at me!</strong> In a fit of Very Poor Timing, last Thursday I assigned my students the following: By 11:59 p.m. on Sunday, you need to have torn me a new one in a comment on the second Dark Knight post. Before you do, I highly recommend you read all your classmates' posts from Thursday, because this is a rhetorical performance. You don't want to be the person who kicked me in the shins when your classmate defenestrated me, nor should you aspire to be the person who decapitated me on my way out the window; no, you want to be the person kicked me in the shins and set me on fire when I looked down then decapitated me on my way out the window. In other words, I want you to be tactically brutal. The best comments will be read aloud in class and their authors will receive bonus points. The results can be found here. Given that my students produced some damn clever readings on Tuesday, I have no choice but to consider the experiment in insult a success. Students do not normally feel comfortable enough to lash out at their teachers like that. (In the future, however, I'll avoid assigning this particular exercise on weekends I end up in the ER. Who wants to be cut down when they barely have the strength to stand?)</span></a></div>

But there is evidence in a new biography of Cheever that he relished his life as a suburban burgher and did not disdain his fellow suburbanites as a class. Cheever was “crazy about the suburbs,” said Blake Bailey, whose book, Cheever: A Life, published in March by Knopf, was written with apparently unrivaled access to Cheever’s journals. “He loved the natural beauty of the Hudson Valley,” Mr. Bailey said. “He loved walking through the woods along the Croton Aqueduct. He liked his neighbors.” I’m not sure how someone can have “unrivaled” access to materials held by Harvard and The New York Public Library, but that’s neither here nor there. This article—from the hard-hitting Connecticut desk—is a full-scale assault on the body of Cheever’s work by people who insist that, in truth, they were all quite normal, thank you very much. Cheever himself was a conventionally quaint exurban alcoholic: Mrs. Cheever casually took care to point out that her husband wrote only in the mornings because by the afternoon he was often drunk on gin. “In those days, people did drink ever so much more than they do now,” Mrs. Cheever said with a chuckle. “It sounds shocking now, but it was not shocking then.” Not to mention boyish and civic-minded: “He once got to drive the fire truck, and that was a big thrill,” Mrs. Cheever said. His family were old-fashioned: “We were old-fashioned,” she said. “We were brought up in private schools.” He was old-fashioned: “He was that old-fashioned,” she said. He was utterly unlike a character in a John Cheever novel, except when he wasn’t: Yet at the same time, Cheever could say in [&quot;The Housebreaker of Shady Hill&quot;], “If you work in the city and have children to raise, I can’t think of a better place.” Note that “say” there. Cheever didn’t write that sentence, because if he had, it’d be a sentence written about a character in a Cheever story and we can’t have that, now can we? It would be inaccurate in the way all the unhappiness Cheever wrote is and will forever be inaccurate. How deeply pathetic is it that the Times tries to deny Cheever ownership of his insight by doing to him what he undid to his characters? It was all very fine, the Times implies, like in that famous story of his that ends: The place was dark. Was it so late that they had all gone to bed? Had Lucinda stayed at the Westerhazys’ for supper? Had the girls joined her there or gone someplace else? Hadn’t they agreed, as they usually did on Sunday, to regret all their invitations and stay at home? He tried the garage doors to see what cars were in but the doors were locked and rust came off the handles onto his hands....</span></a></div>
