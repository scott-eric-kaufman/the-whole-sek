Not that there's anything wrong with the article per se. It just fails to capture the existential horror of elevator entrapment. How would I know? Glad you asked. Three years ago, I spent the better part of an hour trapped in an elevator. I'd rushed to the Humanities Instructional Building to make some copies before an 8 a.m. class and so instead of bounding up four flights of stairs I chose to take the elevator.* The elevators in HIB have a hitch. They overshoot every floor by about an inch and then ... hang ... there ... for a few beats before settling down. You get used to it. So I pressed the button, flew up four stories and was hanging there for a few beats ... and then a few more ... and then a few more ... and so with great annoyance (feigned ostentatiously for a nonexistent audience) I pressed the &quot;Door Open&quot; button. But nothing happened. Then I tried to go to the second floor and pressed the button and it lit up. But nothing happened. So I hit the button with the fire and the ax on it. The one that requires a key to work. Because maybe if they knew someone was fucking with important buttons in the elevator they would send someone to reprimand them. But nothing happened. At this point I was about five minutes into my own hanging. The damn thing wouldn't settle and so I panicked. I started pacing frantically and I checked my watch and I knew I would be late for class because you know and why am I still hanging inches above my point of egress but then wait a minute I'm an inch from the floor I want to be on but am in fact floating in an elevator shaft four stories up with a two-thousand pound counterweight aimed at my head and maybe I ought to take a breath or two and consider the seriousness of my predicament and so with great consideration I jumped in the air and slammed my feet into the floor. I stomped and stomped thinking that I might loosen what normally unhitched and allowed the elevator to settle. Twenty minutes later I stopped. I figured the noise I'd made would alert someone that something was wrong with the elevators. It didn't. I resigned myself to skipping class on account of having the best of all possible excuses shortly after dismissing the possibility that there's only so much air in an elevator and there was no chance I'd suffocate and that the worse case scenario was that I'd drink my water and eat my granola bar and have to evacuate savagely into or onto an improvised something but despite the calm I convinced myself I felt it dawned on me that I was breathless and hyperventilating and that if this fucking...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/04/a-silly-oversim.html"><span><strong>A Silly, Oversimplified Theory of Mind for You to Challenge and Me to Refine</strong> I think other people think processively. Today I learned most other people don't. They neither think processively themselves nor do they think other people think processively. What do I mean? The Short Version You are more knowledgeable today than you were yesterday. I'm not characterizing the knowledge you've acquired as academic. You might only know more about the North Ryoshima Coast in Okami. That counts. No matter how hard you try to learn nothing, you acquire more knowledge every day. You have a view of the world modified by the circumstances you encounter in it. If you think X about politics and then watch CNN, Blitzer will confirm or deny the validity of X. Even though Blitzer confirmed or denied X yesterday, and even though the khokhem will continue to confirm or deny X indefinitely, every independent confirmation or denial strengthens your belief in X. Your feelings about X have changed with the acquisition of new knowledge. Happens every day. So when you write about someone else's ideas it only makes sense to treat them developmentally. To wit: &quot;He believed Y on the morning of 2 January 1900, but that afternoon read a book about Z which modified his feelings about Y. Thus when he awoke on 3 January 1900 his belief is best characterized as Y + Z.&quot; Every day brings new modifications. Note that I write &quot;modifications.&quot; I'm not claiming we'll all be smarter tomorrow for having lived today. The knowledge we acquired might have made us dumber by lending further credence to confirmation biases. (Tell a person the media covered a Bush initiative unkindly and they'll glower at Brian Williams for a night. Teach them to ignore evidence and they'll howl against the MSM for a lifetime.) Our knowledge develops without necessarily progressing. This is why professors cringe when you say you read their article and point you to the revised version of it in their book. Or when you say you read their book they cringe and point you to their latest article. Yet we commonly encounter and produce statements which deny this basic fact. We read that so-and-so thought such-and-such and write about this another so-and-so who thinks his predecessor disowned such-and-such and embraced this-and-that. We ignore lived perturbating in favor of artificial pat. This is my implicit theory of mind. It's why every one of my chapters tells the story of a confused person who figured it out only to lose it in the subsequent tumult. I sing of surety and its inevitable failure. The Long Version It involves Darwin and Lamarck and Darwin and the Emergence of Evolutionary Theories of Mind and Behavior and as the above strongly witnesses I lack the wit to tackle heady matters today. I'll try again yesterday. (When I will have been smarter.)</span></a></div>
