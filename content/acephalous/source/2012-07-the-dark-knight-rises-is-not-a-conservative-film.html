But it seems to me that only someone who is <em>actually blind</em> could be convinced that there&#39;s a greater correspondence between the first and second than the first and third.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a solid reason that Bane and company more closely resemble the mujahideen than the Occupy protestors: they&#39;re from the same part of the world. <em>Batman Begins </em>opens with Bruce Wayne being recruited in a Bhutanese prison and then scaling the Himalayas to train with the League of Shadows. The prison pit in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> is located near the northern Indian border with Pakistan, and the majority of those imprisoned in it aren&#39;t chiroptophobic American billionaires. That Fu Manchu mustache sported by Ra&#39;s al Ghul belongs to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu_Manchu#Controversy" target="_self">tradition of racist caricature</a> of people who come from China and Japan and India. The geographic and narrative cues align with the visual to demand that the League of Shadows be seen as an old school Oriental menace whose politics amount to whatever-frightens-white-people.</p>
<p>Only in this last sense can the projection of conservative politics onto <em>The Dark Knight Rises </em>be understood: the only thing the League of Shadows shares with the Occupy movement is an ideological commitment to frightening white people. That both are successful says nothing about the film, but speaks volumes about the conservatives watching it, who have invested so heavily in their illegible projection that they makes claims like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gotham City is thriving as the third film in the trilogy opens. Harvey  Dent’s legal legacy is so profound there’s no longer a need for Batman.  He’s retired, bum knees and all, while crime continues to decline. So  clearly the city’s punitive system isn’t corrupt, and we certainly don’t  see mass economic woes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Toto is wrong on all counts. Far from &quot;thriving,&quot; Gotham is a city in which orphans have taken to living in the sewers to survive. Dent&#39;s legal legacy may be &quot;profound,&quot; but it&#39;s also founded a lie and maintained by mass incarceration. Crime &quot;continues to decline,&quot; but the prisons overflow with criminals whose prosecutions were legitimate, because &quot;the city&#39;s punitive system isn&#39;t corrupt,&quot; so all those prisoners must have committed the crimes of which they&#39;re accused. Finally, Toto fails to &quot;see mass economic woes,&quot; even though, to return to where this chain of inept summation began, <em>ophans have taken to living in the sewers to survive</em>.</p>
<p>In this case, the competing political interpretations of <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> are not the result of the multivalenced nature of all aesthetic objects so much as <em>simple incompetence from one of competitors</em>. There are sophisticated arguments that the film&#39;s politics don&#39;t square with contemporary liberal or leftist thought—see <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/blogs/zunguzungu/do-not-go-gentle-into-that-dark-knight/" target="_self">Aaron Bady</a> or <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2012/07/24/the-dark-knight-rises/" target="_self">Henry Farrell</a> or <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/07/26/581591/dark-knight-christopher-nolan/" target="_self">Jeff Spross and Zack Beauchamp</a>—but it&#39;s no coincidence that those analyses are eminating from the left. Conservatives aren&#39;t accustomed to considering cultural artifacts with the seriousness they merit, and so on the rare occasion they want to claim ideological kinship with one, they have no idea how.</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef017743bc1daf970d-content"><p>Here&#39;s a dilemma for you, Scott. On the one hand, I totally agree with what you&#39;re saying (in general) about the film&#39;s politics, although I think the representations of Bane&#39;s army are very confused, and do sometimes intentionally echo the Occupy movement -- other times the Taliban, and still <i>other</i> times various incidents from the Terror during the French Revolution. I don&#39;t know whether Nolan thinks Occupy is like the Taliban, or whether he thinks al-Qaeda is like The French Revolution, or <i>what</i>. Even if the film suggests that Bane&#39;s populist rhetoric is hollow, it&#39;s not sophisticated enough to mourn the lack of real populism, because the only people it really cares about are police officers. Furthermore, Catwoman&#39;s best moment, her whispering &quot;there&#39;s a storm coming,&quot; is totally Occupy-esque, forcing the concern that even if this isn&#39;t a depiction of the current moment, it might be an idiotic &quot;warning&quot; about &quot;what could happen&quot; if Occupy gets too big.</p>

<p>Honestly, I doubt such issues are worth untangling. The worst thing about <i>The Dark Knight</i> was all the political overtones; while the political overtones of <i>Batman Begins</i> are somewhat less annoying, they&#39;re also not profound. They precisely echo plotlines I remember from Dungeons &amp; Dragons, with Liam Neeson as a version of the True Neutral character alignment. The <i>only</i> thing that was ever profound about this series was its psychological insight: into fear in the first film, and into chaotic/anarchic impulses in the second. Bane doesn&#39;t represent any sort of comparably interesting principle; he&#39;s basically just a political figure. (Catwoman, on the other hand, is very interesting, but doesn&#39;t get enough screen time.) Not only does this make the film tedious and overlong, it somewhat ruins the whole series for me. I just don&#39;t think Nolan is in command of his symbols, however good he may become at staging them. </p></span>

<p>I think only literally, in that they assault something resembling Wall Street at one point, but even there, the connection fizzles. The OWS movement never launched an attack against Wall Street, and if they had, it wouldn&#39;t have been to short-sell some Wayne stock at the behest of a bureaucrat. It&#39;s one step forward, two steps back for the Bane as Occupier argument.</p>

<p><em> I just don&#39;t think Nolan is in command of his symbols, however good he may become at staging them. </em></p>

<p>I think this is true of <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>, but I think he showed a deft touch with fear as a visual and thematic element in <em>Batman Begins</em>, and that his confusion was at least productive in <em>The Dark Knight</em>. Not so much with this last installment.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef017616d70be7970c-content"><p>The issue you bring up relies on our ability to recognize the salient distinction between peaceful protestors and armed insurgents/terrorists.  The problem is, of course, that this distinction is just the one that many conservatives are unable or unwilling to acknowledge - many conservatives look at OWS and what they see is mujahideen, or at least allies thereof.  While protestors aren&#39;t actually heavily armed ideologues, their motives and tactics are just as opaque to many conservatives, and as such they tend to get conflated and lumped together in the &quot;scary people who want to destroy our way of life&quot; category.  If you told me I was going to watch a movie where vaguely middle-eastern combatants with incomprehensible motives* conspire to attack Wall street, I&#39;d wonder if it was adapted from one of Glenn Beck&#39;s puerile attempts at fiction - that&#39;s exactly the sort of thing a particular sort of conservative would come up with.</p>

<p>The thing is, it&#39;s obviously a lot more subtle than that, and it doesn&#39;t offer any clear morals in that direction.  The whole thing struck me as thoroughly political, but incomprehensibly so.  I think we were supposed to pick up on OWS-ish allusions throughout: cops marching in riot gear, the prominence of Wall street (visually and in the plot), the fact that perhaps every single scene of the entire movie is, in one way or another, drenched in concern with privilege (or lack thereof).  But it didn&#39;t seem like anyone in particular was supposed to consistently represent the protestors, or the rich and successful (which, aside from Wayne, have largely been held in contempt throughout the series, right?)  The standard middle class archetypes - cops and construction workers - make appearances but not as wholesome, hard working Americans.  Rather, they&#39;re shown either as villainous Bane coconspirators, incompetent dupes or people who&#39;ve lost (or are losing) their faith in the system.</p>

<p>Nolan consistenly says that he&#39;s actually not going for any coherent political point, and I&#39;m starting to suspect that this might not just be a diplomatic tactic.  Perhaps he&#39;s fully well in command of his symbols, it&#39;s just that he&#39;s commanding them towards ends that are totally oblique to the axes they&#39;re traditionally employed in (to mix a few metaphors).  I think he&#39;s learned that certain kinds of symbols get under people&#39;s skin, and that might just be all he&#39;s after.  Most people don&#39;t go to movies like this trying to figure out what to make of the symbolism, but they are affected by it, whether they realize it or not.  People like us are going to try to read into it, which is difficult and interesting, and the puzzle of it keeps us talking about the movie.  I left the theater deeply confused and intrigued, and with a strong urge to go and see it again to see if I could work anything out.  Considered as a move intended just to get me fired up, it&#39;s a succes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how much I buy this sort of conscious-imitation-of-meaningfulness interpretation, though.  Does that make Nolan some kind of crypto-hipster, or a pomo super-capitalist (but perhaps I repeat myself!)?  Whatever the case is, considering it fills me with a deep sense of dread - and a renewed desire to try and make some sense out of the whole mess.</p>

<p></p>

<p>* &quot;Step one: we depose the rich!  Step two: we kill everyone, rich and poor alike!  Step three: while the world burns, we bask in the sheer depth of our own malevolent spite!&quot;  Of course, it could be argued that the &quot;depose the rich&quot; people were separate from and just being used by the &quot;kill everyone&quot; people, but the distinction between them isn&#39;t made clear, and they&#39;re armed and vaguely foreign either way.</p></span>

I have to tell you, this is Ann’s sport. I’m not even sure which day the sport goes on. She will get the chance to see it, I will not be watching the event. I hope her horse does well. Of all the many problems with this statement, the least of them is Romney’s use of a definitive article before the word “sport.” Not that suggesting you say things like “Darling, I’ll be out performing the sport this morning” doesn’t make you sound like a caricature of a half-blind aristocrat using a mallet at crutch as he bumbles toward some wickets, mind you. Because that’s a problem. But the real problem is that it demonstrates that Romney’s willing to disavow anyone who might impede his candidacy. That he’s not sure “which day the sport goes on” isn’t an indictment of him as a candidate—it’s an indictment of him as a husband. Admittedly, I only have one wife, so I’m sure if I had—what I mean is that as someone who also only has one wife, I can’t imagine a situation in which I’d be blasé about her representing America in the Olympics, especially when I was campaigning to become the President of America. I can only assume he’s courting the calloused husband vote here, because I can’t think of who else he’d be trying to impress with this brilliant bit of campaign rhetoric. (Which assumes this statement is intentional, being that this is part of his charm offensive and all—but of course it isn’t. This is just garden-variety faux-machismo that Romney’s using to pander to conservatives who’d never heard the word “dressage” before but immediately associated it with vaginas.)</span></a></div>
