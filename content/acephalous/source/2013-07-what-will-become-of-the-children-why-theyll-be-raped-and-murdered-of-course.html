        <meta name="description" content="Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit ranks among the worst shows on television. Not because of the acting -- though the fact that Richard Belzer's been going through John Munch's motions since 1993 has been obvious for about a decade now -- but because it's all exploitation all the time. Its bias is clearly liberal, but cruelly so, in that it manifests itself in the bodies of its victims: children, women, immigrants, non-whites, gays, lesbians, etc. But that only makes it worse, because I suspect that conservatives secretly love the show because it combines the victimization of marginal peoples with the systemic incompetence of the New York state police force and legal system. The world of L&amp;O:SVU is one in which white men frequently get away with doing terrible things to people conservatives don't consider people. Which isn't to say that I don't also watch it. When it's on -- and it's always on -- I can't stop myself. It's that terrible. Last night, for example, I watched an episode in which Big Boi was eaten by a pack of hyenas and Detective Stabler was shot trying to stop a man with a monkey in a basketball. Because as we all know monkeys in basketballs are clearly within the purview of the Special Victims Unit. But you need not watch any particular episode to understand its horribleness, because it's right there in the Riefenstahlian opening credits. To the images! This is New York City, where all the American crime happens. This helicopter shot shows you how many people are in it and, therefore, how much crime is likely to happen. Which is a lot. Or would be were it not for: This tough American woman detective. You can tell she's tough because she has her hands on her hips. You can't actually see that here, but the camera's going to pull back on this still image in a moment because this is action photography. Like in a documentary! With two notable exceptions -- which I'll get to shortly -- it's all panning and zooming on still images. It creates the illusion that you're going to be watching something along the lines of Ken Burns's Civil War, and in the distant past of 1990, when the style of the franchise's opening credit sequence was originally established, maybe you were. But L&amp;O:SVU is a far cry from those early episodes, so this here's a bill of goods. As is the first mini-narrative of the sequence: A close-up on the police line. A crime must have occurred! Fortunately, a still image of a speeding police cruiser is on the way: Will it get there in time? Will the criminal get away with it? He will not! The rapist has been captured!

<p>This tough American woman detective. You can tell she&#39;s tough because
 she has her hands on her hips. You can&#39;t actually see that here, but 
the camera&#39;s going to pull back on this still image in a moment because 
this is <em>action photography</em>. Like in a documentary! With two 
notable exceptions -- which I&#39;ll get to shortly -- it&#39;s all panning and

<p>A close-up on the police line. A crime must have occurred! 
Fortunately, a still image of a speeding police cruiser is on the way:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00004.png"><img alt="" height="282" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00004.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00004" width="503" /></a></p>
<p>Will it get there in time? Will the criminal get away with it?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00005.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00005.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00005" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>He will not! The rapist has been captured! The residents breathe more
 easily. But wait! Just because he&#39;s captured doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s been 
convicted. Might he not get away with the raping on a technicality?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00006.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00006.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00006" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>He will not! He and his raping hands are behind bars. The residents really can breathe more easily now. Who captured him again?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00007.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00007.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00007" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>A tough man-cop posing in front of a bridge! Note that the bridge and
 the man-cop occupy similar areas in the shot, almost as if the bridge 
is as important as the man-cop, unlike the tough American woman 
detective, who only had to compete with her own name. So what does this 
insignificant man-cop do?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00008.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00008.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00008" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>He finds missing babies! Only not really, because this is a still image <em>of a photograph</em> of a missing baby that&#39;s hanging on a chain link fence. So all we know for sure is that he&#39;s <em>alerted</em> to babies being missing and does something about it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00009.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00009.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00009" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Like finding them too late. This is crucial to the ethos of the show:
 the more sympathetic the character the more likely he or she will end 
up dead. The first mini-narrative was a tale of success; the second, one
 of abject failure. That baby had to die. Like the cruel god that it is,
 the show&#39;s narrative efficiency demanded a human sacrifice. <em> </em>I&#39;m
 going to skip past a character so irrelevant the credits almost do too 
and move on to the third mini-narrative, which involves the 
aforementioned Detective Munch:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00012.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00012.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00012" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>One of the benefits of looking like Richard Belzer is that you never 
have to age. Your hair cut and color may change, but you don&#39;t visibly 
age. Belzer is like Batman in this respect: like a proper character in a
 serial narrative, he&#39;s always been the-age-he-is and he&#39;ll always be 
the-age-he-is. But what&#39; s Munch&#39;s story?</p>

<p>A missing child! You can tell because this is a still image of a swing in motion, meaning that the child&#39;s <em>just </em>been taken. What <em>ever </em>can we do to save it?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00016.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00016.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00016" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Identify a suspect! That&#39;s a grand idea! Now to question his known associates, and because this is a suspect on <em>L&amp;O:SVU</em>, they&#39;re going to be:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00017.png"><img alt="" height="279" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00017.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00017" width="498" /></a></p>
<p>Prostitutes from New York-that-was. I get the feeling that the 
writers of the show are actually a little annoyed at the city changing 
for the better. Much easier to frighten people with the horribleness of 
the streets when the streets were legitimately horrible. But I digress. 
What happens next?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00018.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00018.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00018" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Another victim? What happened here? This mini-narrative&#39;s ceased to 
make sense -- which is perfectly in keeping with many of the episodes. 
The monkey in the basketball episode, for example, began with the death 
of an underage model before it got to the rapper-eating hyenas and 
cop-shooting. The narratives on this show frequently veer wildly from 
their original premises, but that doesn&#39;t matter, because:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00019.png"><img alt="" height="279" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00019.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00019" width="498" /></a></p>
<p><em>America</em>! It doesn&#39;t matter because<em> America</em>! This is
 one of the two exceptions to the still-image dictate: a full-screen 
close-up on a waving American flag. What does America have to do with 
sexually based offenses? I don&#39;t know, but sudden swell of patriotism is
 well-timed, because:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00020.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00020.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00020" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This man is a cop! He wrote &quot;Cop Killer&quot; and now he&#39;s a cop! Is there
 anything that can get my mind off this black man on my screen?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00021.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00021.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00021" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Another mini-narrative! This one begins with a photo-negative of a 
carelessly discarded doll. You can tell by its condition the 
impoverished circumstances of its owner. Or maybe its condition tells 
you how long it&#39;s been exposed to the elements. Either way you know by 
its condition that something terrible has happened to a child. Something
 like:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00023.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00023.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00023" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Molestation? What the fuck is going on here? First of all, that&#39;s not
 a child. Second, that&#39;s a dead not-a-child. I suppose they can&#39;t 
actually show you someone being molested, but superimposing the word 
&quot;molestation&quot; over a dead adult body makes no sense. Unless we&#39;re to 
assume that victims of molestation are more likely to end up dead in 
miniskirts and heels -- which, now that I think about it, the show often
 wants us to assume. Anything else it wants us to assume?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00024.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00024.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00024" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>That the police will lovingly cradle us as we die -- even if we&#39;re 
poor black teenagers holding our arms like an addict on the verge of an 
overdose. These assumptions are getting unseemly, but at least they make
 sense, inasmuch as the show wants us to trust the police. It&#39;s almost 
as if they&#39;re fighting the image of Ice T with images of Cops Who Care. 
Because they do:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00026.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00026.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00026" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Even if they&#39;re all white. <em>Which they&#39;re not</em>. Except when they are, they <em>really </em>are:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00028.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00028.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00028" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Now that that&#39;s settled, it&#39;s time for the <em>coup de grace</em>. This is the Hall of Justice:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00031.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00031.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00031" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>And what&#39;s happened to it?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00033.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00033.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00033" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It&#39;s been perverted! I mean inverted! Who can save us?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00039.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/law-and-order00039.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="law and order00039" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>A bunch of people trying really hard not to move <em>because this isn&#39;t a still image</em>. In the original series, this closing scene involved the cast walking-and-talking in the Hall of Justice. But here they&#39;re <em>just standing there trying not to move</em>.
 It&#39;s the worst image of a police force imaginable: &quot;We&#39;re the Special 
Victims Unit, and we&#39;re here to help. Just don&#39;t ask us to move or 
anything.&quot; It&#39;s also the moment that best captures the &quot;dynamic&quot; of the 
show: the narrative should be moving, and you think you can see it 
moving, but it&#39;s trying really hard not to lest it lose the &quot;timeless&quot; 
quality that allows it be re-run forever. Not despite but <em>because</em> it&#39;s a terrible show.</p>
<p>Just watch the opening credits.</p>

<p>What a horrendous, unconscionable, and thoroughly illiberal statement. There is such a thing as improper comments made to exaggerate an impassioned point, and then there is prejudgment of large swaths of other people, people as every bit multifaceted as yourself. Accusing someone of denying the humanity of the Other (in the capital sense) is in a way denying their own humanity.  Labling one a degrader is a degradation onto itself. I will not be a idle party to such patronage. I have been a long time reader, so I know you hold Chomsky in no small regard, so I implore you  to refrain from reducing large groups into unPeople.</p>

<p>While I loathe to condescend to someone of your stature, I find your remarks unwarranted.  As a liberal, the sentiment scares me. </p></span>

Unfortunately, it seems I’m illiterate: 1. Draw a line around the number or letter of this sentence. How does one draw a line around something? I thought lines were those infinitely extendable things with no curvature. How I am supposed to draw a line around the number of this sentence? I have an idea! Wait — that’s three lines. Fuck. Maybe I should try to draw it around the letter of this sentence? Not that I know what that’d be. Do they mean “the” letter of the question or “the” letter of “this sentence.” Given that both the question and “this sentence” have more than one letter, I’m not exactly sure what they’re asking me to do. Maybe this? Granted that’s nine lines now, but they’re now “around” both “the” “letter” and “the” number and “the” word “number” in the question as well as the words “this sentence.” I may not be right but I can hardly be wrong. Moving on: 22. Place a cross over the tenth letter in this line, a line under the first space in this sentence, and circle around the last the in the second line of this sentence. I got a little confused over whether they meant the first space in this sentence or “this sentence,” but I made up for it: They didn’t ask me to draw Bad Ass Jesus struggling to get off the cross, but they didn’t not ask me to either. I’m sure they’ll appreciate it. What’s next? 29. Write every other word in this first line and print every third word in same line, (original type smaller and first line ended at comma) but capitalize the fifth word that you write. That’s it — I’m fucking illiterate. I don’t even know what the difference between “writing” and “printing” is. You win Louisiana! I won’t be casting any votes that matter anyway. Just once I’d love to live in a state where they do.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2013/07/mad-men-whos-in-care-of-what-now.html"><span><strong>Mad Men: Who's &quot;In Care Of&quot; what now?</strong> In my first post on “In Care Of,” I discussed the importance of the logic of the “Oh Really” sequence to the episode; in the second, I not only proved that cowboy hats aren’t the new lasers, but also that Matthew Weiner is dedicated to creating pain by any means necessary, including undermining the importance of structural elements like the “Oh Really” sequence. In other words, my first two posts were about how Weiner creates tension via the visuals and sustains it by undermining the visuals that created it via the narrative. Most television shows — and most television writers — have a particular set of visual and narrative crutches they break out when they need to rouse their viewers. For example, Joss Whedon favors hackneyed speeches undermined by immediate circumstances: BUFFY: No, it doesn’t stop! It never stops! Do you — do you think I chose to be like this? You have any idea how lonely it is? How dangerous? I would love to be upstairs, watching TV or gossiping about boys or — God, even studying! But I have to save the world. Again. Or: LOKI: Enough! You are, all of you are beneath me! I am a god, you dull creature, and I will not be bullied by – (HULK flattens LOKI by SMASH) Whenever one of Whedon’s characters starts to speechify like William Wallace pontificating about the theoretical possibility of Scottish independence, that character’s likely to find his or her authority undermined either by their own words or someone else’s actions.* Whedon telegraphs it to a man who proceeds to semaphore it at your face. Which is why Mad Men continues to make for compelling television: Weiner and his writers are clearly aware of how they’re manipulating us and, like a great boxer, always slug us where we’re not expecting. Especially when they’ve established those expectations in a particular episode. In the last scene of this one, he combines the “Oh Really” sequence with its content-dependent and confessional opposite. To wit: He opens with this long shot of the Draper/Whitman family. They’re all clearly staring up at something, and because of the extremely high angle, seem to be dominated by whatever that something is. Establishing that something’s doing the dominating before actually showing it on screen has two effects: the first is to rouse our curiosity; the second, to remind us of what’s become obvious by now, i.e. that this family’s been burdened by an unknown and unspoken something for quite some time. Of course Don knows what it is, but to Sally, in particular, there’s just been this horrible presence that’s tainted her father’s relationships with everyone. She has no idea what it is, but this shot’s telling you here it is. But before cutting to this looming presence, Weiner thinks we need a refresher on how close this family is at the moment: These are the children. They’re together, but: They’re also apart from Don. Each slightly encroaches into the others’ shot, but for...</span></a></div>
