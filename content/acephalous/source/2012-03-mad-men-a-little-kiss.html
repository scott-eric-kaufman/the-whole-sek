For example, here's the sole appearance of the former Mrs. Draper: It occurs during the &quot;Previously on Mad Men&quot; introduction, not within the body of the show itself.

The audience doesn't know that, so she merely seems like a child who should have, but hasn't, overcome her night terrors.

As I&#39;ve remarked on <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/08/ads-without-products.html" target="_self">multiple</a>&#0160;<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/09/mad-men-picking-up-the-wrong-suitcase.html" target="_self">occasions</a>–<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/09/mad-men-in-the-suitcase.html" target="_self">and even diagrammed</a>–hallways are extremely significant on <em>Mad Men</em>, suggestive of the fact that these are shiftless people who are neither entirely sure where they&#39;re from anymore (Draper) or that they&#39;re trying to own the space between their amorphous origins and designated destinations. But as this episode makes clear on three occasions, this is nothing more than a convenient lie. Here is Draper owning a hallway in &quot;The Suitcase&quot;:</p>

She doesn&#39;t own this hall–she&#39;s exploring it. When she finally (and mistakenly) believes she&#39;s found her bearings:</p>

Because it&#39;s not the bathroom door:</p>

Technically, nothing does, but scan down and the audience can see what Sally shortly will, only not from her perspective yet–the small of Megan&#39;s back and the curve of her hips. Something is coming between Draper and the only woman he loves unconditionally, and Sally can see that something&#39;s ass:</p>

I have a feeling–something more like an inchoate theory–that ten years from now this show will be remembered as having belonged to Sally, but I&#39;ll share that when I can muster up more evidence. For the moment the real matter of significance is that Sally perceives Megan as the single greatest impediment to developing the relationship she so desperately desires with her father. She recognizes, without truly understanding it, that there&#39;s a disconnect, and Getzinger highlights this not merely by showing the a vulnerably half-naked Megan, but by indicating that Sally can&#39;t tell whether it&#39;s the woman in the bedroom or the bedroom door that&#39;s frustrating her:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0163034f2e42970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Mad men00047" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0163034f2e42970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0163034f2e42970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mad men00047" /></a><br />That door jamb is the visual equivalent of a poetic enjambment, uniting two lines in manner that foregrounds the fact that they ought not be united. A quick example from W.B. Yeats&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing_to_Byzantium" target="_self">Sailing to Byzantium</a>&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An aged man is but a paltry thing,<br />A tattered coat upon a stick, unless<br />Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing<br />For every tatter in its mortal dress [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The enjambed &quot;unless&quot; functions as a redirected thought dangling off the edge of an unthinkable abyss–the moment when an &quot;aged&quot; Yeats decides unequivocably that this is &quot;no country for old men,&quot; but despite the apparent abruptness of his decision, the tranistion from the enjambed &quot;unless&quot; and the &quot;soul&quot; which opens the next line creates a hope for some sort of continuity. Just read it aloud: &quot;unle<em>ss</em>/<em>S</em>oul clap its hand and <em>s</em>ing.&quot; Possibility abides despite the apparent disconnect. Unlike&#0160;many other moments in this episode, the ostensible disconnect between this daughter and this father seems surmountable. She just doesn&#39;t know it yet.*</p>
<p>But she should: Draper concludes this conversation with an offer to cook her one of his patented witching hour omelets, a process which began when the dark was deep and the shadows long and ended right about here:</p>

But their centrality isn&#39;t the item of significance in this frame: in the lower left corner of the shot is the footstool on which Draper will be sitting at the height of his humiliation, which will, of course, be brought about by:</p>

Sally&#39;s point-of-view shot earlier set this up, and it leads to a shot in which her worst fears are being realized. Getzinger cuts to Sally:</p>

She&#39;s alone and off-center–and there&#39;s a good reason that the shot&#39;s off-kiltered. Look at what she sees:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e9457b6c970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Mad men00074" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e9457b6c970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e9457b6c970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mad men00074" /></a><br />Her father and Megan are one side of a walled-in nook, she and her siblings on the other. Moreover, whereas Megan and her attention-grabbing shirt are inching closer to a central position, Sally&#39;s almost being pushed off-frame. Don&#39;s not consciously aware of what he&#39;s losing, but losing her he is. Because this is such a long episode, I&#39;ll save my thoughts about Peter and Peggy and Joan for another post, but before I do, I just want to follow up on the significance of the aforementioned table. Here&#39;s Don at his &quot;surprise&quot; birthday party:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01676444913b970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Mad men00168" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01676444913b970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01676444913b970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mad men00168" /></a><br />The nook is now off-camera and Don&#39;s literally dominating the shot: even the color of his shirt sets him apart from the dark dresses and suits of his guests. But with the footstool now center-stage, Draper is at his emptiest. He is alone and all eyes are upon him, uncomfortably astride a piece of furniture designed for feet, and he&#39;s miserable. He&#39;ll sleep alone tonight because he realizes that whatever it is he has with Megan, it&#39;s not enough–and the more she tries to convince him otherwise, the further he pushes her away.</p>
<p>*Before you ask: I can&#39;t believe I just wrote that much about a door jamb either.</p>

<blockquote>Scott’s posted his take on the episode...It’s great, in that we somehow manage to cover almost none of the same material, and it’s also great because Scott has an uncanny ability to recreate and explain the theory behind the direction. His analysis of Sally’s perspective is a tour-de-force. I guess I would say that the episode still feels smart to me, but it doesn’t feel glamorous, and Mad Men needs to be both. Otherwise it can’t get away with its crimes against our modern sensibilities.</blockquote>

<p>You make a great case for Sally as the surprise protagonist of the show. The problem is that she&#39;s never going to be old enough to write copy (at least, not more than once or twice in special episodes), and the show&#39;s depiction of the creative process has always been, for me at least, a big part of its appeal.</p>

<p>Did you read Sloane Crosley&#39;s <a href="http://www.esquire.com/the-side/feature/tv-recaps/mad-men/season-5-episode-1-7612927" rel="nofollow">piece in Esquire</a>? It&#39;s mostly plot summary, but she does point out that maybe Sally&#39;s gaze is a desiring one.</p>

<p>The rest of my post is <a href="http://kugelmass.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/don-drapers-big-avventura/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Still no clue how to make this here TypePad recognize trackbacks.</p></span>

Among a few interesting items uncovered in trying to examine the facts behind the shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin without drawing any conclusions, was that a widely viewed photograph of Martin appears to have been altered, somewhat. Here is what appears to be the original via the Miami Herald. The one below has been observed in the media and at forums such as Democracy Now. Clearly, it has been lightened, or softened, somehow. Along with other possible alterations, he looks far more, perhaps innocent is the right word, in the altered image. Dan Riehl believes that if you &quot;lighten&quot; an image -- that is, if you contribute to the impression that there's a possibility that the person in the photograph may be white -- that person &quot;looks far more ... innocent.&quot; So: White people? Innocent. Darkies? Guilty. Just look at them. They're &quot;technically thugs,&quot; and therefore deserve to be shot by gun-toting racists who've made 46 calls to 911 complaining about &quot;suspicious&quot; darkies engaging in activities such as walking in and out of their parents' open garages or playing soccer in the street. I won't republish them here, but I exchanged a series of emails with Riehl -- who's more than welcome to republish my replies, if he so desires -- after I called him a racist for being afraid of seventh graders who were only &quot;technically thugs.&quot; His defense was that I would've been afraid too, which tells you all you need to know about Dan Riehl. That he worked for and admired Andrew Brietbart and supports the political theater of James O'Keefe is entirely beside the point, except that it isn't. He's a racist parading his denial with all the subtlety of someone who dons a &quot;GOD HATES FAGS&quot; sign at a Marine's funeral. And just as classy, too.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/03/filming-the-sausage-being-made-is-very-very-expensive-my-friends.html"><span><strong>Filming the sausage being made is very, very expensive, my friends.</strong> My promised follow up post about Peter's sad descent into the trappings of Draper's life is nearly half-complete, but I wanted to address something that's come up in the comments first, because I encounter variations of it every time I teach. Uncle Ebeneezer March 27, 2012 wrote On a tangent–a friend of mine read your post and remarked that they doubt that THAT much thought really goes into it. I disagree, but I’m sure you must hear that sort of sentiment all the time and I’m just curious how you usually respond. He's correct in that I encounter this all the time–frequently as a back-handed compliment about me putting more thought into the show than the people who made it–but it's usually the person doing the slapping that has no clue what they're talking example. For example, in an interview I can't relocate, Christopher Nolan was discussing the logistics of using an IMAX camera to capture Christian Bale hanging off of a skyscraper in Hong Kong. The joke of it was that between the helicopter, its pilot, safety equipment, those equipped to use it, Nolan and Bale's salaries, the insurance policy on Bale, the rental cost of the IMAX camera and its crew, every single syllable was costing Warner Brothers $300,000, &quot;so if everyone would quit fucking cursing they could fucking film this fucking shot for under three million dollars.&quot; And that's pre-production. So do I occasionally hazard into a situation in which I over-read some last minute practicality? No doubt. But should the wizards with the duct tape see my analysis and note that I missed their wizardry, don't you think they'd be proud that they'd done their job so well I couldn't imagine it having been done differently? But if your friends are still unconvinced–and if my students are any indication, many of them will be, send them to the &quot;full credits&quot; listing of a show like Mad Men. John Rogers—friend of the blog and showrunner of Leverage—can add to any of the many things I’ve forgotten, but keep in mind that all of the following people must be paid, eat, have their equipment plugged in and powered up, etc., and remember as your friend’s scrolling down that very, very long list, there are a number of unusual positions, such as: hair stylist/background hair stylist hair stylist/key hair stylist hair department head special effects makup artist on-set dresser art department coordinator greensman set decoration buyer second assistant camera “a” cameria/ second assistant camera “b” camera best boy rigging electrician genny operator post-post production assistant coordinator colorist dailies final colorist I’ve chosen that list a little randomly, but it’s also a little representative of the collaborate work involved in any significant production. Odd as it may seem, the burden of proof that something isn’t in a particular scene should fall to the casual viewer, who thinks television is magic and all you need is a camera, some costumes, and a few pretty pictures to make it work. Granted, that’s...</span></a></div>
