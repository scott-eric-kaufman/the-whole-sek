SEK: Welcome, folks, to my first (and most certainly last) interview with former Vice Presidential-candidate, Sarah Palin. Before we start, Sarah, I want to read what I wrote last night in my journal—I'm only kidding. That wouldn't be professional. How about we start with an easy one? I know how much you love circles, Sarah, so how about you talk in one for me? PALIN: The political system is what creates this disenchantment with the people looking at the political system. SEK: You are a marvel. Now, say something that reveals yourself to be even dumber than your haters think you are about, say, the results of the last election. PALIN: That is not a representative form of government that our country was founded upon. SEK: It certainly isn't. I mean, it can't be. Governments are only representative when they represent the perspective of— PALIN: Common sense conservatives. SEK: With— PALIN: Common sense conservative values. That's why you see pressure from the tea party movement, from others, wanting to—wanting those common sense conservative values back in. SEK: Such as? PALIN: Common sense solutions that sometimes we're made to feel stupid because we believe in these common sense solutions. SEK: Exactly. Do you think things will change? PALIN: I think things are going to change, too. And if you look back in history, you see that it is about—every 200 years, something drastically changes in a society, in a culture, in a governmental system. We're due for that change—just on a historical perspective, it shows us that yes, something is coming. SEK: You really believe that? PALIN: I do believe it, because again, we can't be so stupid as to see these common sense solutions. SEK: Speaking of the future, is it here today? PALIN: Already the change is creating this unrecognizable system that we're a part of. SEK: In the past, could the French see into the future, and if so, how would they feel about the French today? PALIN: Even the French recognized, too, the potential in this free country. And the French gifted the Statue of Liberty to us, in partnership, this international symbol of liberty and freedom—the French hoping that we wouldn't lose that and we won't evolve into something more along their lines. SEK: Precisely. One last thing: can you prove that the copy-editors at Fox are out to get you? PALIN: Well, let me tell you one thing in that vain. SEK: Thank you, Governor Palin, it's been a pleasure. PALIN: And the people are going to decide and I think he is going go and it is time. SEK: Thank you, Governor, the interview's over. You— PALIN: My favorite. That would be great. SEK: Your favorite? Favorite what? Seriously, Madame Governor, you— PALIN: Gems. Gems representing the natural resources in our nation. SEK: Gems?

<p><strong>SEK:</strong> Welcome, folks, to my first (and most certainly last) <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,583028,00.html">interview with former Vice Presidential-candidate</a>,
Sarah Palin. Before we start, Sarah, I want to read what I wrote last
night in my journal—I&#39;m only kidding. That wouldn&#39;t be professional.
How about we start with an easy one? I know how much you love circles,
Sarah, so how about you talk in one for me?<strong><br /><br />PALIN:</strong> The political system is what creates this disenchantment with the people looking at the political system.<br /><br /><strong>SEK:</strong>
You are a marvel. Now, say something that reveals yourself to be even
dumber than your haters think you are about, say, the results of the
last election.<br /><br /><strong>PALIN:</strong> That is not a representative form of government that our country was founded upon.<br /><br /><strong>SEK:</strong> It certainly isn&#39;t. I mean, it can&#39;t be. Governments are only representative when they represent the perspective of—<br /><br /><strong>PALIN:</strong> Common sense conservatives.<br /><br /><strong>SEK:</strong> With—<br /><br /><strong>PALIN:</strong>
Common sense conservative values. That&#39;s why you see pressure from the
tea party movement, from others, wanting to—wanting those common sense
conservative values back in. <br /><br /><strong>SEK:</strong> Such as?<br /><br /><strong>PALIN:</strong> Common sense solutions that sometimes we&#39;re made to feel stupid because we believe in these common sense solutions.<br /><br /><strong>SEK:</strong> Exactly. Do you think things will change?<br /><br /><strong>PALIN:</strong>
I think things are going to change, too. And if you look back in
history, you see that it is about—every 200 years, something
drastically changes in a society, in a culture, in a governmental
system. We&#39;re due for that change—just on a historical perspective, it
shows us that yes, something is coming.<br /><br /><strong>SEK:</strong> You really believe that?<br /><br /><strong>PALIN:</strong> I do believe it, because again, we can&#39;t be so stupid as to see these common sense solutions.<br /><br /><strong>SEK:</strong> Speaking of the future, is it here today?<br /><br /><strong>PALIN:</strong> Already the change is creating this unrecognizable system that we&#39;re a part of.<br /><br /><strong>SEK:</strong> In the past, could the French see into the future, and if so, how would they feel about the French today?<br /><br /><strong>PALIN:</strong>
Even the French recognized, too, the potential in this free country.
And the French gifted the Statue of Liberty to us, in partnership, this
international symbol of liberty and freedom—the French hoping that we
wouldn&#39;t lose that and we won&#39;t evolve into something more along their
lines.<br /><br /><strong>SEK:</strong> Precisely. One last thing: can you prove that the copy-editors at Fox are out to get you?<br /><br /><strong>PALIN:</strong> Well, let me tell you one thing in that vain.<br /><br /><strong>SEK:</strong> Thank you, Governor Palin, it&#39;s been a pleasure.<br /><br /><strong>PALIN:</strong> And the people are going to decide and I think he is going go and it is time.<br /><br /><strong>SEK:</strong> Thank you, Governor, the interview&#39;s over. You—<br /><br /><strong>PALIN:</strong> My favorite. That would be great.<br /><br /><strong>SEK:</strong> Your favorite? Favorite what? Seriously, Madame Governor, you—<br /><br /><strong>PALIN:</strong> Gems. Gems representing the natural resources in our nation.<br /><br /><strong>SEK:</strong> Gems?<br /><br /><strong>PALIN:</strong> Yes. I thought, oh, no, he&#39;s going to do a gotcha and that&#39;s why I google—I had Track google real quick.<br /><br /><strong>SEK:</strong> A little help in here? Somebody?<br /><br /><strong>PALIN:</strong>
So full of symbolism, though. And those seven points represent our
seas, our continents. Anyway, my son, I asked him very quickly, &quot;Tell
me what all this means.&quot; He says, &quot;Quite timely, mom. I&#39;ll tell you
what the Statue of Liberty means. I just got a tattoo of the Statue of
Liberty on my arm.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>SEK:</strong> <em>Anybody</em>?<br /><br /><strong>PALIN:</strong> I know what is coming.<br /><br /><strong>SEK:</strong> That makes one of us.<br /><br /><strong>PALIN:</strong>
We just brace ourselves. But so be it. There are a lot of important
things going on in this world right now. And I think that if we were to
hesitate and hunker down and not say what we believe, then we&#39;re going
to be part of the system that so many Americans are losing faith in.
I&#39;m not going to be a part of that. But I learned a lot about it this
morning. I would be perfectly happy to go back to Wasilla, Alaska, with
my five children and grandson and raise a happy, healthy family and
love the great outdoors and do the things we do in Alaska. Now, let me
address legal immigration and we need to continue to be so welcoming
and inviting of those who are represented there by our Statue of
Liberty. The immigrants, of course, built this country...</p><p></p>

<p>The combination of Palin&#39;s speaking style and the nearly illiterate transcription does make for some real moments. </p>

<p>But I have to say this: I read that interview, and Palin made more sense than Beck. Beck comes across as a delusional paranoid who&#39;s desperately looking for companionship, and Palin comes across as the saner of the two.</p></span>

<p>I&#39;d put it the other way: &quot;people who believe that cheap rhetorical ploys are emotionally effective.&quot; It&#39;s not reasonable or evidence-based to believe that they&#39;re seriously trying to win an argument in rhetorical terms: they&#39;re trying to distract and enrage, and to prop up their sense of self-worth by denigrating others (there is a <i>lot</i> of that going on in the interview, too). </p></span>

It's a sad truth that having dark skin and sounding different from white people impacts a candidate's electability, but it's a truth nonetheless. What Trent Lott said—what Palin believes to be &quot;essentially along the same lines&quot; of Reid's lamentable political truth—was that he was proud that Mississippi supported a segregationist candidate, and that the if the rest of the country had &quot;followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years, either.&quot; Moreover, to this day Lott hasn't explained what exactly &quot;all these problems&quot; that would've been avoided had blacks been kept in their place actually are. So, for Palin, acknowledging a sad political reality is the equivalent of wishing that the Civil Rights Movement had never happened because, for Palin, racism is a game. Not only is it a game, she unwittingly confesses that she and her fellow Republicans are currently very much playing it by themselves, and are annoyed that the Democrats refuse to play along by &quot;kind of letting Harry Reid's comments slide.&quot; She wants to play Race because just this once, she believes her team can win. Is it any wonder the large majority of non-white Americans find her and her party reprehensible?</span></a></div>

(Still, I'll soldier on, with the caveat that I'm about to watch the eighth episode of the most recent season and would rather not have it spoiled. Not, mind you, that I think it could be, as the one of the defining features of the show is the thundering predictability of its characters. That's not as an indictment of Matt Weiner or his writing staff, merely an acknowledgment of the show's central conceit: these are people who want to be left behind when the rest of the world is raptured by history—at least at first. Don Draper and his fellows at Sterling-Cooper aggressively court their own obsolescence by cultivating an aesthetic that appeals to inhabitants of a disappearing culture. In this respect, focusing the show around the Gatsby in the gray flannel suit is an inspired decision: Draper is a man at a remove both from his own history and those of archetypes that shape his character, and as such is constitutionally belated. He does not believe in free love, like his beatnik paramour Midge Daniels, he merely lacks a convincing moral objection to committing serial adultery. His persona is a fashioned response to a vanishing culture, and it appeals—both for the clients of Sterling-Cooper and viewers of the show—to the perpetually recycled nostalgia for a time in which romantic figures of powerful genius were recognized and compensated accordingly. In the decades previous, as evidenced by an article Earnest Havemann wrote for Life in 1958, it had actually been true thatmost advertising agencies were started on the strength of one man's genius and personality. These old giants of the business had an intuitive feel for advertising. Flying strictly by the seat of their pants, they made brilliant guesses as to what would put the public in the mood to buy and planned brilliant campaigns around their hunches. Yesterday's ad man used to take a look at the product, then go off in a corner to dream up his campaign. Today's ad man sends for the research on what consumers are thinking about at the moment and often goes out to size up the consumer himself. Havemann captures, in miniature, why Peter Campbell's career will inevitably eclipse Draper's: a person can only have hunches about cultures they know intimately, so the value of a Don Draper is inversely proportional to, for example, market penetration into urban black communities. This is not to say that Campbell's attempt to identify the desires of black Americans at the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement makes him any more sympathetic as a character, or to viewers, as his commitment to equality is as instrumental as Draper's is to free love. Campbell is, in a sense,...</span></a></div>
