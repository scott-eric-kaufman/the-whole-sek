But there is evidence in a new biography of Cheever that he relished his life as a suburban burgher and did not disdain his fellow suburbanites as a class. Cheever was “crazy about the suburbs,” said Blake Bailey, whose book, Cheever: A Life, published in March by Knopf, was written with apparently unrivaled access to Cheever’s journals. “He loved the natural beauty of the Hudson Valley,” Mr. Bailey said. “He loved walking through the woods along the Croton Aqueduct. He liked his neighbors.” I’m not sure how someone can have “unrivaled” access to materials held by Harvard and The New York Public Library, but that’s neither here nor there. This article—from the hard-hitting Connecticut desk—is a full-scale assault on the body of Cheever’s work by people who insist that, in truth, they were all quite normal, thank you very much. Cheever himself was a conventionally quaint exurban alcoholic: Mrs. Cheever casually took care to point out that her husband wrote only in the mornings because by the afternoon he was often drunk on gin. “In those days, people did drink ever so much more than they do now,” Mrs. Cheever said with a chuckle. “It sounds shocking now, but it was not shocking then.” Not to mention boyish and civic-minded: “He once got to drive the fire truck, and that was a big thrill,” Mrs. Cheever said. His family were old-fashioned: “We were old-fashioned,” she said. “We were brought up in private schools.” He was old-fashioned: “He was that old-fashioned,” she said. He was utterly unlike a character in a John Cheever novel, except when he wasn’t: Yet at the same time, Cheever could say in [&quot;The Housebreaker of Shady Hill&quot;], “If you work in the city and have children to raise, I can’t think of a better place.” Note that “say” there. Cheever didn’t write that sentence, because if he had, it’d be a sentence written about a character in a Cheever story and we can’t have that, now can we? It would be inaccurate in the way all the unhappiness Cheever wrote is and will forever be inaccurate. How deeply pathetic is it that the Times tries to deny Cheever ownership of his insight by doing to him what he undid to his characters? It was all very fine, the Times implies, like in that famous story of his that ends: The place was dark. Was it so late that they had all gone to bed? Had Lucinda stayed at the Westerhazys’ for supper? Had the girls joined her there or gone someplace else? Hadn’t they agreed, as they usually did on Sunday, to regret all their invitations and stay at home? He tried the garage doors to see what cars were in but the doors were locked and rust came off the handles onto his hands...." />

</p>
<blockquote><p>[His] writings suggest that he seemed to take a jaundiced view of so manicured and lovely a setting.
</p>
<p>
But there is evidence in a new biography of Cheever that he relished
his life as a suburban burgher and did not disdain his fellow
suburbanites as a class. Cheever was “crazy about the suburbs,” said
Blake Bailey, whose book, <em>Cheever: A Life</em>, published in March by Knopf, was written with apparently unrivaled access to Cheever’s journals.
</p>
<p>
“He loved the natural beauty of the Hudson Valley,” Mr. Bailey said.
“He loved walking through the woods along the Croton Aqueduct. He liked
his neighbors.”</p></blockquote>
<p>
I’m not sure how someone can have “unrivaled” access to materials held by <a href="http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/%7Ehou00054">Harvard</a> and <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/resources_for_american_literary_study/v027/27.1bosha.html">The New York Public Library</a>, but that’s neither here nor there.&#0160; This article—from the hard-hitting <em>Connecticut</em>
desk—is a full-scale assault on the body of Cheever’s work by people
who insist that, in truth, they were all quite normal, thank you very
much.&#0160; Cheever himself was a conventionally quaint exurban alcoholic:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Mrs. Cheever casually took care to point out that her
husband wrote only in the mornings because by the afternoon he was
often drunk on gin.
</p>
<p>“In those days, people did drink ever so much more than they do
now,” Mrs. Cheever said with a chuckle. “It sounds shocking now, but it
was not shocking then.”</p></blockquote>
<p>
Not to mention boyish and civic-minded:
</p>
<blockquote><p>“He once got to drive the fire truck, and that was a big thrill,” Mrs. Cheever said.</p></blockquote>
<p>
His family were old-fashioned:
</p>
<blockquote><p>“We were old-fashioned,” she said. “We were brought up in private schools.”</p></blockquote>
<p>
He was old-fashioned:
</p>
<blockquote><p>“He was that old-fashioned,” she said.</p></blockquote>
<p>
He was utterly unlike a character in a John Cheever novel, except when he wasn’t:

<blockquote><p>Yet at the same time, Cheever could say in [&quot;The
Housebreaker of Shady Hill&quot;], “If you work in the city and have
children to raise, I can’t think of a better place.”</p></blockquote>
<p>
Note that “say” there.&#0160; Cheever didn’t <em>write</em> that
sentence, because if he had, it’d be a sentence written about a
character in a Cheever story and we can’t have that, now can we?&#0160; It
would be inaccurate in the way all the unhappiness Cheever wrote is and
will forever be inaccurate.&#0160; </p>
<p>
How deeply pathetic is it that the <em>Times</em> tries to deny Cheever ownership of his insight by doing to him what he undid to his characters?&#0160; It was all very fine, the <em>Times</em> implies, like in that famous story of his that ends:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The place was dark. Was it so late that they had all
gone to bed? Had Lucinda stayed at the Westerhazys’ for supper? Had the
girls joined her there or gone someplace else? Hadn’t they agreed, as
they usually did on Sunday, to regret all their invitations and stay at
home? He tried the garage doors to see what cars were in but the doors
were locked and rust came off the handles onto his hands. Going toward
the house, he saw that the force of the thunderstorm had knocked one of
the rain gutters loose. It hung down over the front door like an
umbrella rib, but it could be fixed in the morning. The house was
locked, and he thought that the stupid cook or the stupid maid must
have locked the place up until he remembered that it had been some time
since they had employed a maid or a cook. He shouted, pounded on the
door, tried to force it with his shoulder, and then, looking in at the
windows, saw that the place was empty.
</p>
<p>Then everyone yelled, “Surprise, Neddy Merrill!&#0160; It is your birthday
and the place looked empty because we cleared the room so we could
dance!” Neddy’s daughters approached him, one after another, and
planted a kiss on his cheek and a tie to his chest.&#0160; “I love these
ties,” Neddy exclaimed.&#0160; Everyone at the party drank judiciously and no
one died on the way home.&#0160; It was the best day of Neddy’s life ever.</p></blockquote><p>(<a href="http://www.margaretsoltan.com/"><em>via</em></a>.)</p>

With most polarizing literary figures—Pynchon, Barthelme, Acker, Wallace, and so forth—even when a person chokes on the air of consuete affectation, he still understands why other readers happily inhale it. Pound might not be your bag, for example, but you understand why someone else would stick his head in it. It also works the other way around: I love Ulysses, but I can understand why an intelligent person would just as soon chute the book as read it. Except with Grant Morrison. The chapter Wolk devotes to him in Reading Comics scans like a fanboy's paean to a body of work he barely understands: It's smart and complicated, and sometimes rushed and baffling, but mostly it's awesome, and where The Invisibles occasionally kicks back to indulge in its metaphysical side, Seven Soldiers starts hammering the FUN!!! button on its first page and never really stops. Still, it's loaded to the gills with subtext. It doubles as a Kabbalistic parable that also discusses the relationship between two-dimensional and three-dimensional existence and features symbolic correspondences with the chakras and the elements and planets—nearly every character, object, and incident in it has some kind of distinct allegorical value. The symbolism, as clear as it is, is almost never made explicit, but if you're looking for it, it's there on every page. (278) What can a critic do with a paragraph in which someone praises Morrison for writing an obliquely-allegorical new-age amphibian with a fun-button? Nothing. So this past week I sat down and read reams and reams of Morrison (about 70 percent of the material on this bibliography) and came to the conclusion that tomemos knows of what he speaks—because now I both hate Grant Morrison and am incapable of seeing why anyone appreciates him. Why? Because in the end every Grant Morrison story is about Grant Morrison writing stories. Consider the final issue of his run on Animal Man (1990): Morrison inserts himself into the story so his character, Animal Man, can learn he's a character in the comic Animal Man. This scene works because for two years the book had relentlessly fiddled with its meta-fictional conceit. (As with, for example, the Passion of Wiley E. Coyete.) Moreover, the consequences of this meta-fictional interaction work within the confines the of the narrative: Buddy Baker had been distraught over the murder of his wife and children, and as a result of his conversation with Morrison, they are resurrected (none the wiser for their grisly murders) and returned to him by the end of the issue. The narrative ruptures draw attention to the conventional features of comics as a genre. They differ in degree from the sort of formal...</span></a></div>
