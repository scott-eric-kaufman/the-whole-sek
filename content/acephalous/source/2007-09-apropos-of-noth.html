A private letter especially. And business letters, to my thinking, are very little pleasanter. Nearly all the enjoyment is taken out of every letter I get by the reflection that it must be answered. And I do so dread the affliction of writing those answers, that often my first and gladdest impulse is to burn my mail before it is opened. For ten years I never felt that sort of dread at all because I was moving about constantly, from city to city, from State to State, and from country to country, and so I could leave all letters unanswered if I chose, and the writers of them would naturally suppose that I had changed my post office and missed receiving my correspondence. But I am &quot;cornered&quot; now. I cannot use that form of deception any more. I am anchored, and letters of all kinds come straight to me with deadly precision. They are letters of all sorts and descriptions, and they treat of everything. I generally read them at breakfast, and right often they kill a day's work by diverting my thoughts and fancies into some new channel, thus breaking up and making confusion of the programme of scribbling I had arranged for my working hours. After breakfast I clear for action, and for an hour try hard to write; but there is no getting back into the old train of thought after such an interruption, and so at last I give it up and put off further effort till next day.

I tried in good faith to answer them—tried every now and then, and always succeeded in clearing off several, but always as surely left the majority of those received each week to lie over till the next. The result was always the same, to wit: the unanswered letters would shortly begin to have a reproachful look about them, next an upbraiding look, and by-and-by an aggressive and insolent aspect; and when it came to that, I always opened the stove door and made an example of them. The return of cheerfulness and the flight of every feeling of distress on account of neglected duty, was immediate and thorough.

The Internet Provides Me Cookies!</strong> John once wrote about &quot;blogging getting results,&quot; but he never imagined this. This afternoon, the cookies I so desperately desired were delivered to my door. Todd. was true to his word, providing the wife and I with delicious chocolate-mint-raisin cookies. (Sisyphus can consider her lack of cookies a just punishment for the water which fell from her heavens. Cookies are divine, but as Todd. and I discussed this afternoon, some weather would be nice.) I can't thank him enough ... although I feel obliged to apologize for the state of my 1) (patchy) beard, 2) book-littered apartment, and 3) dissertation-preoccupied mind. At three in the afternoon, all my thoughts are belong to Twain.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/09/on-what-is-made.html"><span><strong>On What Is Made Great, By Virtue of Being Terrible</strong> I need to lower the tone around here. Too many of the comments are penned in too high a dudgeon, so I'm left with none but nuclear options: Ogged convinced me to watch Entourage . Like him (and those eligible to vote for Emmys), I was captivated by Jeremy Piven's man-child antics. (Not that this is a theme.) (And seriously, I'm going to link to that post again, because Piven's that genius and Luther's that right.) Tonight's episode—watched in a momentary fit of irresponsibility, as I'm now busier than I thought humanly possible—hammers home a point I've been flailing at for the last few weeks: I'm utterly incapable of judging the quality of the show I've just watched. Certainly, some scenes are pure wish-fulfillment, but who am I to say that they're merely an expression of it? Might they not hie to the standards of televised verisimilitude? How would I know? My ignorance of the lives of the famously wealthy and beautiful leaves me utterly unable to judge the accuracy of representations of their lives. Since my interest in the show is predicated on Piven's outrageous responses to the absurd situations his clients force him into by virtue of 1) their famously beautiful wealthiness or 2) their obscenely exaggerated male-bondedness, I'm at an utter loss to distinguish between &quot;quality&quot; and &quot;entertainment value.&quot; Because the lower the quality, the more entertaining it is. Which means that as the quality of the show slips, it simultaneously increases ... leaving me watching a show whose merits I can't defend with a straight face. I can't think of a single corollary of this in literature, but I'm sure one exists. So please, somebody, enlighten me ...</span></a></div>
