		<span id="comment-94997632-content"><p>I once spent a long night at the University of Pennsylvania&#39;s vet hospital.  In the waiting room, I saw a frat boy in a black bomber jacket get out of an expensive looking SUV, talk to the vet about his dog, and calmly refuse to pay for whatever care his dog needed.  It was too expensive.  Put him down.  The dog, despite whatever was the matter, sat eagerly by their side, no doubt waiting to go home with his daddy.  </p>

<p>Now, I understand we all have to make hard decisions as pet partners.  But something about this boy made me want to back his SUV over his skull.  I thought of the scene from the Iliad, where one soldier spears another through the face and plucks him out of a chariot like a fish.  No Christian charity on my part.  </p>

<p>Scott, your post makes me wonder if my feelings arose from the powerlessness I felt while waiting to hear about my cat&#39;s condition.  Nothing makes one feel more macho than knowing that one can&#39;t even protect a little furry girl.</p>

<p>In any case, following Charlotte&#39;s lead, three kitties and two bunnies are sending cosmic vibes of good will to you and the poozle.  </p></span>

<p>Charlotte, Human, and Miriam, thanks for your support.  This has been an incredibly difficult time, and the online love has helped immensely.  (I&#39;ve even gotten phone calls from some of my readers -- and a lurker!?! -- expressing support.  This makes me think it&#39;s too easy to find my phone number online, but temporarily happy about that.)</p>

<p>Luther, Christ, what an awful shit ... but in his defense (sorta kinda), he may have been doing the emotional equivalent of yanking off the Band Aid.  I mean, I think the best of people, so long as I can.  This is a weakness.  But I&#39;d like to think that he didn&#39;t want to lose face in front of his entourage, and that his heartless display was the result of an intense desire to flee the premise before the waterworks started.  Such is my faith in men.</p>

<p>Justin, I didn&#39;t intend on it being cryptic, or at least, no more cryptic than the information I&#39;d received.  I try not to fuck with my commentariat, except, you know, when I tell you that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing.</p></span>

I have a few scars to prove it. You now have time to love her until she is no longer here. Treasure it because it may be short (remember pokey). You now have time alone with the &quot;first love&quot; in your life because your wife is still away and I am sure Rachel is happy to be the only woman in the house. I am hoping your new year is better then the last year and I am sure it will be if you truly believe it will be better (Just some junk from the book &quot;The Secret&quot; or whatever it is called.</p></span>
