Second, the first list member to respond to Adam Stephanides' original linkage said I can barely stand to read half of these posts. And the most cretinous ones (if that is a word, and if I am using it correctly) don't seem worth responding to, because they reflect opinions held by people so certain of their own infallible faculty of interpretation that they are impervious to correction.

		<span id="comment-10715035-content"><p>I thought their remarks were fairly mild, considering.  Fans are fans.  To mention just the issue that they are most annoyed by, Adam Roberts, Henry, or Jonathan can discuss the <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the_cruelty_of_dickens/#4892" rel="nofollow">undeniable torture bag-and-baggage</a> as an examination of the image of &quot;Christ with a whip&quot;, and we can debate whether this is really what the book does at any level but that of authorial intention, but they pretty much have to fall back on resentful denial fueled by insistant overreading of what was written.  I just hope that no Lacanian critic, or worse, a critic who has extensively read the theorist known as &quot;Z&quot; ever writes up something on _The Book of the New Sun_ where they can see it.  (What would the likely angle be?  Approval of the authentic urge towards power, perhaps?  The worn-out world of Urth as metaphor for the neo-liberal order, waiting for the <br />
<a href="http://jdeanicite.typepad.com/i_cite/2005/10/real_existing_c.html" rel="nofollow">revolutionary whip-wielder</a>?)</p>

<p>As for the Yves Meynard comment, I wouldn&#39;t characterize it as disagreement that his book was a &quot;possible source&quot; -- he pretty much says that it was in some respect, though not to the extent that I claimed.  I hadn&#39;t known that Wolfe had started writing _The Wizard Knight_ before Meynard published, and given the similarities between the two, the acknowledgement of Meynard in Wolfe&#39;s book, and the order in which they appeared (1998 for _The Book of Knights_, 2004 for _The Knight_), I assumed wrongly that the basic idea for one had been taken from the other.</p>

<p>The &quot;Stupid Cretinous Cancer Boy!&quot; thing -- well, yes, it sort of is amusing, given that I&#39;m sure that they didn&#39;t know about your history.</p></span>

<p>So, I was wondering, are you the <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/45483/" rel="nofollow">Antichrist</a>?  According to Falwell, there are only 4.5 million candidates, and you are one of them, so embodying the worst form of Evil gives you rather an advantage.  I figure that even if you don&#39;t seem to have magical powers or uncanny charisma at the moment, you still might be on the short list of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession#Theories_regarding_exhaustion_of_the_list" rel="nofollow">replacement candidates</a> just in case something goes wrong.</p></span>

My biggest complaint about categorizing Wolfe as being a rather brilliant one trick pony is the fact that he deliberately abandoned many of the most successful parts of New Sun for his future projects.  His preoccupation with eidetic memory is reversed in the Latro books, and the highly elegiac prose of New Sun is completely abandoned for countless bits of dull dialoge in Long Sun, narrated by a character completely outside the main scheme of the action rather than Wolfe&#39;s previous 1st person forays.  I would love to defend Wolfe, but I don&#39;t find his use of a torturer or its tropes as a weakness.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-10973190-content"><p>I don&#39;t know exactly what kind of evidence you want to appreciate Wolfe - most of my admiration comes from a structural standpoint.  I apologize for the length of this post.  Let&#39;s take his most famous work, New Sun.  It is written by a monarch (or autarch) who is engaged in quelling not only the hostile powers to the north but who also must contend with the elite, genetically engineered exultants who he holds in thrall by keeping the women of prominent families in his harem where he can easily destroy them.  His entire scheme in writing the story of his rise to the throne serves to promote several complex motives: to show that, even though he was not in any line of succession, he had no choice but to assume the throne.  He was a pawn of powers beyond his control.  But at the same time, he wants to assert the natural order by positing the ideal relationships between servants and masters: Malrubius&#39; portrayal of a love between a dog and a man as the highest form of love because it mirrors the love between god and man ultimately serves the narrator&#39;s purpose in creating a picture of events in which he was both completely powerless but at the same time completely right in assuming power and ruling with an iron fist.  To further gain the sympathies of the exultants,he even claims to have an exultant living inside of him, and to have been a strong supporter of the most dangerous insurgent working against the old autarchy.  The text works both as a perfect political document as well as a symbolist work of religion: water and healing are constantly intermingled whenever a healing occurs, Severian&#39;s sword is planted in the ground at key points to become a cross, etc, etc, so that in the end water and purification become synonomous with rebirth - and that is exactly what happens in the text.  These subtle structural nuances are what makes Wolfe&#39;s works so compelling - but they are complex enough to work against their obvious religious interpretations, too. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve read Short Sun, here is a link to an essay I wrote on the topic, which cements why I admire Wolfe&#39;s gnostic, architectural use of symbols to create real meaning:<br />

		<span id="comment-11005478-content"><p>Marc, I hate to reopen this thread at this time, but I suppose that I should answer your piece.  I think that it&#39;s an example of overinterpretation, and that many elements of it are not very plausible.  The purpose of this overinterpretation appears to be to move some of the artistic flaws of the books from Wolfe to Severian.</p>

<p>First, why it isn&#39;t plausible just at the level of plot.  There is no such thing as a &quot;monarch (or Autarch)&quot;, and Severian is not a king.  He is the recepient of an artificial memory which gives him command words that operate the machinery of Autarchy, and that is the base of his power.  In particular, the Autarchs do not have a line of succession (as descent) in the way that monarchs do; most people do not know why a new Autarch is the Autarch or even who they are, and there is no suggestion that there is a usual line of succession that deviance from would require a justification.  Most of the elements that you cite are doubtful in whether they would have the effect on exultant opinion that you propose: why would they be more likely to support someone who &quot;had an exultant within them&quot; due to the distasteful practice on cannibalistic memory-eating?  Would there really be enough Vodalis supporters left so that Severian would have to placate them by inventing a connection?</p>

<p>If Severian had written the whole thing as political propaganda, he is a very bad propagandist.  Better to hush up certain events, and definitely better not to tell people the exact manner in which they too could be Autarch if they had Severian&#39;s corpse.  Of course, this last could be a lie.  But here we get into completely unfalsifiable speculation, because Severian&#39;s unreliable narrative is our only source of information.  It is at least suggestive that Severian brings the New Sun, something that he knows will lose him at least some of his power, and a risk that the Severian you describe would probably not take.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s look at the function of this interpretation for you.  It means that every part of the text that you may dislike -- Malrubius&#39; portrayal of the highest love, for instance -- can be blamed on the character instead of the writer.  I would not find this portrayal of the highest love as between god and man at all out of keeping with Wolfe&#39;s general themes.  And Severian being a pawn of powers that he can not control is hardly the only Wolfe book in which this occurs.  The rather obvious set of religious symbolisms are consistent with other Wolfe works.</p>

<p>So, can your interpretation be conclusively disproved?  Probably not, but it doesn&#39;t matter.  The qualities of the book are the same whether Wolfe wrote as Wolfe or Wolfe wrote them as Severian.  If you think that, e.g. puzzle-piece writing is bad art, then you will think so whether Wolfe did it or &quot;Severian&quot; did it.</p>

<p>Lastly, of course you don&#39;t find &quot;his use of a torturer or its tropes as a weakness&quot; if your favored interpretation constructs a Severian that instead of being moved around in more-or-less human fashion is instead &quot;ruling with an iron fist.&quot;  That fantasy power element supports exactly the point I was trying to make.  (And of course it is entirely inconsistant with the &quot;Christ with a whip&quot; interpretation of why the torture motif is there.  Christ never wrote self-serving political propaganda.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-11017254-content"><p>Rich, all valid points.  I&#39;m merely saying that it is possible to look at the narrative as political propaganda if one were inclined to do so, and that this reading is obviously directly in contradiction with the religious elements of the text.  I think there is enough richness of character (Severian&#39;s treatment of the younger apprentices when he is raised to journeyman, when he abruptly beat up his young friend to keep him in order and catch the apprentices by surprise, for example) to indicate that Severian is indeed trying to rule with an iron fist without seeming to do so.  But I think it is a veritable richness of Wolfe&#39;s writings that both the religious connotations and the political ones obviously cannot both be true, but both seem to be if certain facts are examined and given more weight than others.  </p>

<p>Here I will open myself up to criticism - I rather like the whole Malrubius/government scene, and the idea of Severian as a christ-like savior who just happens to effect a parousia of rebirth.  On one level, Severian escapes the &quot;evil&quot; of his upbringing, but on another, he succeeds in becoming the most successful killer of all time.</p>

<p>Yes, I think Wolfe is sophisticated enough to have a narrator with ambitions that are quite different from Wolfe&#39;s.  And in considering art, I don&#39;t particularly care which political views are expounded by the artist, or it would be impossible for one person to like Ezra Pound, Upton Sinclair, and Dante.  Yet considering only the products they produce, their art, it is possible to find something aesthetically pleasing in all of them.  I just think that the aesthetic aspects of Wolfe&#39;s work are being sold short because people don&#39;t agree with some of his perceived philosophy.  Your characterization of the text as puzzle piece writing ignores the richness of allusion and cultural myth that Wolfe consistently employs.  If it were merely puzzle piece writing, one could certainly make the same claim about Joyce, resorting to cheap tricks like the Man in the McIntosh.</p></span>

Pillow, Don DeLillo; or (muffled screams)</strong> The popular press fête few novelists with the intensity which accompanies each new Don DeLillo &quot;event.&quot; So before I crashed the party I decided I should see whether anyone else had. Thanks to Gale's Expanded Academic ASAP, I now know I'm not alone. Earlier Jonathan chided me for &quot;an unfortunate and inaccurate comparison to Baudrillard [un]worthy of Dale Peck.&quot; My only (admittedly lame) defense consisted of a frank admission that I thought the comparison both obvious and apropos. So I delight in communicating that someone else considers the comparison equally apt: in his review of Cosmopolis, James Wood makes a strikingly similar observation: Eric [Packer] is given to riffing on contemporary culture and technology, in a Baudrillard-bruised language evocative of an assistant professor of cultural studies with, alas, an MFA: &quot;He took out his hand organizer and poked a note to himself about the anachronistic quality of the word skyscraper. No recent structure ought to bear this word. It belonged to the olden soul of awe, to the arrowed towers that were a narrative long before he was born.&quot; Or: &quot;He was thinking about automated teller machines. The term was aged and burdened by its own historical memory. It worked at crosspurposes, unable to escape the inference of fuddled human personnel and jerky moving parts. The term was part of the process that the device was meant to replace.&quot; He being James Wood and me being my lowly self, he trumps my bland comparison by coining the compound &quot;Baudrillard-bruised&quot; to describe Packer's language. Still, the fact that his impression of DeLillo-speak dovetails neatly with mine encourages me to perform even greater displays of brazen evaluation. But I need not bother, because Wood has already done the work for me: The difficulty of the book is working out how much of this is Eric's mildly satirized theory and how much of it is DeLillo's indulged and wanton theory. Eric would think just like this, one supposes. But as so often, DeLillo's language seems too complicit, in its scrabbling enthusiasm, with the subject of his protagonist's reflections. &quot;Here was the heave of the biosphere&quot; (whatever that means): alas, this sounds like DeLillo, not Eric. (But then we do not know what Eric sounds like, because he has no quiddity.) It is DeLillo who seems to be excited as he regards &quot;the heave of the biosphere.&quot; Exactly! I too am unable to differentiate between DeLillo's voice and the voices of his various narrators. I took my copy of Underworld from the shelf to prove this, but Wood says it better than I can: Eric Packer's techno-incantations, his amorous ruminations on postmodernity, are continuous with Brian Glassic's in Underworld, the Brian Glassic who stood before the Staten Island landfill and reflected thus on garbage: To understand all this. To penetrate this secret. The mountain was here, unconcealed, but no one saw it or thought about it, no one knew it existed except the engineers ... a unique cultural deposit ... and he saw himself...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/happy_halloween.html"><span><strong>Happy Halloween! or, I Hope This Isn't Too Offensive</strong> No time for matters intellectual, as I'm off to celebrate Halloween in the most offensive costume I could muster at a moment's notice. When your options are your wife's clothes and a bicycle helmet, well, they're limited. (Pictures available upon request. This post will certainly be deleted before I hit the market.) I should add that I've a reputation for wearing and/or suggesting the most offensive Halloween costumes imaginable. If you don't believe me ... then you don't believe me, since there's a 00.000% I subject my brilliantly offensive costumes on the general public. All apologies in advance, but the odds of this appearing on my permanent record are less than nill. (But they really are brilliant. This year's &quot;costume&quot; represents the bottom of my costumery barrel. Terrible, really. Offensive by sartorial necessity. But what can you do when you prefer the great indoors to the world of human interaction and thus don't consider costumes 'til the day's upon you.)</span></a></div>
