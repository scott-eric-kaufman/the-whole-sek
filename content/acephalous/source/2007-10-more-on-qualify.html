That&#39;s just what they do; it&#39;s useless to try to get them to do anything else.  You have a tendency to <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/absolutely-posi.html#comment-86635212" rel="nofollow">expect better of them</a>, which I&#39;ve never seen work out.  KC Johnson, for instance, has since updated his blog post on the Piot article to read:</p>

<p>&quot;The Transforming Anthropology editors appear to be distancing themselves from the article, admitting to one DIW reader that it was not peer-reviewed before publication.&quot;</p>

<p>(and note the &quot;distancing&quot; language, as if they had ever claimed that it was peer reviewed).  But he still has:</p>

<p>&quot;This article represents what passes for a scholarly publication in Piot’s field.&quot;</p>

<p>Conversation with people like that isn&#39;t possible.</p>

<p>But they do spark some good <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/absolutely-posi.html#comment-86967584" rel="nofollow">doggerel</a> sometimes.  I think that there are a few good reasons for pseudonymity -- if you&#39;re a woman, and don&#39;t want to get harassed online simply for being one, perhaps, or if you&#39;re pre-tenure and are super-sensitive about anything that might cause you not to get it -- but most of the exaggerated, unspecific fear about using one&#39;s name plays into the right&#39;s strategy for making people generally fearful all the time.</p></span>

<p>Wow.  If this refers to Amac&#39;s inquiry, then it&#39;s about as disingenuous as it gets.  An editor was asked about Piot&#39;s article and the review policy of the journal. He/she responded that it was a short commentary, and that these usually aren&#39;t peer reviewed.  That&#39;s hardly &quot;distancing&quot;.  </p></span>

He used to sometimes rebut actual arguments that I&#39;d actually made at Acephalous. But I&#39;m not counting on it any more. People disposed to take Rich&#39;s remarks at face value should follow the first link he provides:<br />
<blockquote>the wingers had progressed to quote-mining for damaging points, and speculating that maybe a tenured professor really wrote something because she wanted to lead a <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/absolutely-posi.html#comment-86820908" rel="nofollow">lynch</a> mob.</blockquote>Read what I wrote (6:46 AM), then Rich&#39;s &quot;fuck off&quot; response (6:53 AM), then my discussion of the phrase &quot;lynch mob&quot; (8:34 AM). Rich knows what I think, but prefers to leave readers of this thread with a different impression. Classy.</p>

<p>To anticipate the inevitable acid rejoinder, filling this thread on Qualifying Exams with more <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/absolutely-posi.html#comment-86967584" rel="nofollow">fevered projections</a> of what I <i>surely</i> must be secretly thinking: Rich, the Ahab roleplay has turned creepy.</p>

<p>Scott, this guy is diverting <i>your</i> comment threads with his obsession. Why not suggest that he find himself another whale?</p></span>

I do not consider that to be a defense.  And clearly I was saying that you were beyond the pale for using those metaphors in the first place, as if they seriously related to the motive for the statement -- I didn&#39;t think that you were literally saying that Lubiano would be first with a torch.</p>

<p>Rich, you are one of a kind.</p>

<p>Re: your new point that the <i>use</i> of the metaphor<blockquote>the construction and then defense of the portraits of forty-six disfavored Duke students as exemplars of a kind of white-male folk-devil</blockquote>puts me &quot;beyond the pale&quot; &quot;in the first place&quot;:  here is what JPool had written immediately prior, on 17 October 2007 at 10:29 AM (emphasis added):<br />
<blockquote>Rather than painting the actions of the Duke faculty who signed the listening statement to be <b><i>universally</i></b> about the construction and defense of some kind of (white male) folk-devil, I wish that folks would recognize it as, <i><b>at least in part</i></b>, an act of sympathy; a sympathy that included, but also went beyond their students.</blockquote><br />
<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/absolutely-posi.html#comment-86726418" rel="nofollow">Some commenter</a> immediately followed JPool by remarking that &quot;Well, a lot of Jpool&#39;s comment is reasonable&quot;, followed by some lengthy Quote-Mining.  (Hey, <i>that guy</i> can be your new Great White!)  So JPool and I partly agree.  We are each suggesting that the Listening Statement was not <i>universally or exclusively</i> about the construction and defense of some kind of (white male) folk-devil, because it was <i>in part or mostly</i> about something else.</p>

<p>Further complaints about the paleness of the metaphor, take it up with JPool.</p></span>

No, I think it&#39;s inaccurate.  I wrote an editor to ask whether all formats were peer reviewed and which format &quot;KC&#39;s World&quot; fit in; the brief response directly answered my questions.  Nothing about &#39;distancing&#39; or &#39;admission&#39;.<br />

<p>That said ...</p>

<p>Amac: <em>I think that you envision blogging to be more conversation than bully pulpit.</em></p>

<p>I do, but of late, I haven&#39;t been treating it as such.  You may not&#39;ve meant to write that, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not true.  </p>

<p>Mikhail: <em>i suddenly envision therapy-as-blogging - would that be different from blogging-as-therapy?</em></p>

<p>Only in location and expenditure.  I <em>could</em> pay to sit in someone&#39;s office and blog ...</p>

<p><em>... your date is looking away, eyes clearly concentrating on something else, you snap your fingers and say - &quot;hey! pay attention! this is going to be on the test!&quot;</em></p>

<p>We already do this in so many subtle ways, I don&#39;t see why we shouldn&#39;t formalize it.</p>

<p>Adam: <em>If in this, your 20th year of graduate studies, you are feeling guilty about not giving enough time to blog comments, you may need to consider just shutting down the blog, lest you lose all you hold dear.</em></p>

<p>Pffft.  I&#39;ve only been here seven years, and I&#39;m dragging my feet on purpose a bit -- to keep health coverage and because my wife&#39;s only in her fourth year -- so I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll lose <em>all</em> I hold dear.  My self-respect, <em>maybe</em> ...</p>

<p>Sisyphus: <em>he should shut down the grad school and blog 24-7.</em></p>

<p>No.  (<em>vehemently</em>)  Then I&#39;d have to spend an hour writing my dissertation to stay sane.  I like the system I have thank-you-very-much.</p>

<p>Rich: <em>I bet that the blog pays more than grad school does.</em></p>

<p>Given the fact that I&#39;m living off my wife and odd tutoring assignments ... I&#39;d say that yes, the blog certainly pays better then the university at this point.  (And in cookies, which I appreciate more than money.)</p>

<p>Mikhail (again): <em>doesn&#39;t he blog 24-7 anyway? mother always said it is not polite to speak of someone present in the third person - would one assume, vis-a-vis the whole blog-as-conversation thing, that scott is &quot;present&quot;?</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s a damn interesting question, and not one I&#39;m sure I can answer.  I always find comment sections somewhat ghoulish in the sense that the poster seems to inhabit every thread.  (This happens most frequently on <a href="http://www.unfogged.com/" rel="nofollow">Unfogged</a>, in which everyone seems cognizant of Ogged&#39;s presence even when he hasn&#39;t commented for hours.  He&#39;s always there, lurking, waiting for the right moment to materialize ... or so it seems.  There&#39;s an interesting dynamic there, something I ought to think about more before continuing.</p>

<p>Rich (again): <em>You have a tendency to expect better of them, which I&#39;ve never seen work out. KC Johnson</em></p>

<p>That wasn&#39;t me thinking better of KC, merely acknowledging his rhetorical savvy.  He&#39;s quite good at forcing you to use his terms, and with looking like an unjustly punished puppy when you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I noticed that he reposted his response with his sweeping dismissal of anthropology intact.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any doubt he&#39;s impugning an entire discipline now.</p>

<p>More shortly.  I just discovered why my nose was itching ...</p></span>

Longer Answer: Abso-fucking-lutely nothing. Actual Answer: You have three lists: one for theory, one for genre, and one for period. (Some substitutions are allowed.) Each should contain thirty works. None ever does. At your list-meeting, the members of your committee decide what belongs on each list. They never reach a decision. They &quot;compromise&quot; by including every work any of them mentioned. You now have nine months to read three lists. Each consists of sixty works. Let me do the math for you: 270 / 180 = FUCKED Because you are. You cannot read a book every 1.5 days and have anything intelligent to say about it. But you must read a book every 1.5 days and have something intelligent to say about it. You must also remember these intelligent things because one day soon the graduate coordinator will escort you into a room in which you will sit with all the books on your lists and write for six hours. On Tuesday you will write about your A List. On Thursday you will write about your B List. Only &quot;write&quot; is not an appropriate word for what you will do. You do not write: You eject words. Your committee wants words, damn it, and you will give them words. You will not give them punctuation because punctuation is for chumps and you will not give them grammar because they wants words not grammar and they cannot has big word because big word not available in time are been allotted and your word cannot do sense because you to be in rooms for six hour and is under pressure and if you does not performs good you and your asses are to be kicked from grad schools to curbs and then you died. Fortunately, the qualifying exams have a purpose: namely, to have you do something you'll never again be asked to do in your professional career, so that you may better appreciate how well-suited you are for it and only it. Because no one does well on their exams. No one &quot;passes&quot; in the conventional sense. Your committee is always disappointed. Everyone on it thought you were going to be the first person in the history of academia to perform exceptionally under extreme duress and on a exam the likes of which you've never taken (nor will ever take again). This disappointment is reasonable. To be expected. You will do equally poorly on your oral examination (covering your C List). Your committee members will lower their eyes and shake their heads. That is what they are there for. They want kabuki from a method actor. You are there to oblige. You dance inappropriately and they try not to laugh. You are tell them sentences with some word and they try not to laughs. Then they are pass you and you can have happy and alcohol. Your life are now for good. You is ABD.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/cashier.html"><span><strong>Assailed by the Miraculous</strong> Three weeks ago Friday I went to the UCI Cashier's Office to settle two outstanding debts: Overdue Library Fine: $12.50 Fall Student Fees: $2,640.00 I wrote the UC Regents a check, snaked through the Cashier's line and handed the check to the teller. She smiled and chirped: &quot;Have a great weekend!&quot; So you can imagine my surprise when I went to register for the Fall Quarter and learned from the Registrar that I hadn't paid my Student Fees. I walked over to the Cashier's Office. I snaked through the Cashier's line. I questioned the teller about the status of my account. The teller pursed her lips at her monitor and asked me whether I paid my fees on time. I said I had. She asked whether I'd mailed them or handed them to a teller. I said I'd handed them to a teller. She asked whether the check I'd written had been cashed. I said it had. She excused herself for a moment. The teller had excused herself for more than a moment. Much more. I waited. Tapped my fingers. Pulled my ear. Fiddled with buttons. Ten minutes went by. I leaned over the partition. Looked around. Leaned back. Tapped fingers. Ten more minutes passed. I huffed audibly. Crossed my arms. Scowled. That did the trick. The teller returned and said: &quot;Did you pay a library fine the same day?&quot; I said that I had. &quot;How much was it for?&quot; I said how much it was for. &quot;Because the library applied all the funds you deposited that day to the overdue fee.&quot; &quot;They did?&quot; &quot;They did.&quot; &quot;Why'd they do that?&quot; &quot;They don't know.&quot; &quot;Will they undo it?&quot; &quot;They said they'll try.&quot; &quot;They said they'll try to refund the $2,640 they applied to a $12.50 overdue fee?&quot; &quot;That's what they said.&quot; &quot;Did they indicate whether they thought they'd be successful?&quot; &quot;They didn't say.&quot; &quot;Did they say what I should do if they weren't successful?&quot; &quot;They didn't say.&quot; &quot;But they did say they'd try to refund the $2,640 they applied to a $12.50 overdue fee?&quot; &quot;That's what they said.&quot; &quot;Did they happen to tell say when they'd try to refund the $2,640 they applied to a $12.50 overdue fee?&quot; &quot;They said because they assessed the fine last month the money's already been reallocated—&quot; &quot;Can they allocate it back?&quot; &quot;They said it's not that simple. In the meantime, why don't you pay your student fees now and work out this situation with the library later?&quot; I looked at her as only a man without $2,640 in his wallet looks at a teller who assumes he does. (For reference: a subtle variation of &quot;You Must Be Fucking Kidding Me.&quot;) I continued staring until she looked uncomfortable. &quot;If you pay your student fees now you can work out the library situation later.&quot; I stared some more. &quot;I'd be happy to help you process your student fees.&quot; The staring evolved into glowering around the words &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;help.&quot; I was determined to remain mute until she...</span></a></div>
