        <meta name="description" content="(x-posted.) Irony is delicious. WLS is upset because one manufactured scandal drowned out the The New York Times’s coverage of the most important unreported story ever. If you’re of the opinion that the McCain campaign is overstuffed with tactical geniuses dedicated to sitting on the sordid tale of the Annenberg Challenge until closer to the election, listen up, because I’m about to tell a story. It begins, as Tom Maguire writes, “[a]t a White House event with Bill Clinton [where] philanthropist Walter Annenberg announced that he was making a $500 million grant to cities across the nation to put towards public school reform.” The intrigue and perfidy originate, as does everything currently wrong with the country, with Bill Clinton and a leftist billionaire cast in the Soros mold. Bill Ayers, former WU terrorist and Annenberg’s brother-in-ideology, requested and received $50 million for urban enrichment programs which would, in accordance with the core beliefs of all involved, function as leftist indoctrination camps. While much is known and reviled about Ayers and his personal choice to chair the Chicago Annenberg Challenge’s board, Barack Obama, relatively little attention has been paid to their benefactor—the man who personally approved Ayers’s $150 million plan to put the Che back in Chicago—Walter Annenberg. Annenberg arrived on the national scene when he and his father, Philadelphia publisher Moses “Moe” Annenberg, were charged with evading $3,258,809 in income taxes. Although based in Philadelphia, the Annenberg clan’s ties with the Chicago political machine were already well-established: his co-defendants included “James M. Ragen Sr., Chicago, former general manager of Nation-wide News Service, Inc.; James M. Ragen Jr., Chicago, son of the Nation-wide general manager; Charles W. Bidwill, Chicago, head of a printing company and owner of the Chicago Cardinals, professional football club; [and] Herbert S. Kamin, Chicago.”[1] His father was successfully prosecuted, but Walter avoided jail-time. He spent the better part of the next decade in a manner befitting a billionaire wastrel: rubbing shoulders with the Hollywood elite.[2] When he assumed control of his father’s publishing empire after Moses’s death in 1952, Annenberg used those Hollywood connections to start a little magazine called TV Guide. Under his stewardship, Triangle Publications waged war against conservative American values from the pages of Seventeen to the stages of American Bandstand. As the 1952 election neared, he hosted countless fundraisers for the first “eggheaded” political neophyte from Illinois whose Presidential aspirations were dashed by a humble war hero: Adlai Stevenson. At an exclusive Malibu Beach estate, the Los Angeles Times reported, Annenberg convened “[m]ore than 40 State and national Republican Party leaders [for] dinner with Sen. Nixon, who flew [there] from Denver to meet with them.”[3]. That doesn’t sound—never mind. Even hard-core communist sympathizers can have a day of clarity. Annenberg’s solstice of sanity ended with a winter chill.

until closer to the election, listen up, because I’m about to tell a

			<div class="entry-more">
				<p>It begins, as Tom Maguire <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/obama-ayers-and-the-annenberg-challenge-cover-up/2/">writes</a>,
“[a]t a White House event with Bill Clinton [where] philanthropist
Walter Annenberg announced that he was making a $500 million grant to
cities across the nation to put towards public school reform.”&nbsp; The
intrigue and perfidy originate, as does everything currently wrong with
the country, with Bill Clinton and a leftist billionaire cast in the
Soros mold.&nbsp; Bill Ayers, former WU terrorist and Annenberg’s
brother-in-ideology, requested and received $50 million for urban
enrichment programs which would, in accordance with the core beliefs of
all involved, function as <a href="http://patterico.com/2008/09/10/nyt-story-mentioning-obama-ayers-and-chicago-annenberg-challenge-all-lost-in-a-sea-of-lipstick-coverage/">leftist indoctrination camps</a>. 
While much is known and reviled about Ayers and his personal choice to
chair the Chicago Annenberg Challenge’s board, Barack Obama, relatively
little attention has been paid to their benefactor—the man who
personally approved Ayers’s $150 million plan to put the <em>Che</em> back in
<em>Chicago</em>—Walter Annenberg.</p>
<p>Annenberg arrived on the national scene when he and his father,
Philadelphia publisher Moses “Moe” Annenberg, were charged with evading
$3,258,809 in income taxes.&nbsp; Although based in Philadelphia, the
Annenberg clan’s ties with the Chicago political machine were already
well-established: his co-defendants included “James M. Ragen Sr.,
Chicago, former general manager of Nation-wide News Service, Inc.;
James M. Ragen Jr., Chicago, son of the Nation-wide general manager;
Charles W. Bidwill, Chicago, head of a printing company and owner of
the Chicago Cardinals, professional football club; [and] Herbert S.
Kamin, Chicago.”<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/breaking-news-o.html/#1">[1]</a></p>
<p>His father was successfully prosecuted, but Walter avoided
jail-time.&nbsp; He spent the better part of the next decade in a manner
befitting a billionaire wastrel: rubbing shoulders with the Hollywood
elite.<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/breaking-news-o.html/#2">[2]</a>
When he assumed control of his father’s publishing empire after Moses’s
death in 1952, Annenberg used those Hollywood connections to start a
little magazine called <em>TV Guide</em>.</p>
<p>Under his stewardship, Triangle Publications waged war against conservative American values from the pages of <em>Seventeen</em> to the stages of <em>American Bandstand</em>.&nbsp; As the 1952 election neared, he&nbsp; &nbsp;hosted countless fundraisers for the first “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egghead">eggheaded</a>”
political neophyte from Illinois whose Presidential aspirations were
dashed by a humble war hero: Adlai Stevenson.&nbsp; At an exclusive Malibu
Beach estate, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported, Annenberg
convened “[m]ore than 40 State and national Republican Party leaders
[for] dinner with Sen. Nixon, who flew [there] from Denver to meet with
them.”<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/breaking-news-o.html/#3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p><em>That doesn’t sound</em>—never mind.&nbsp; Even hard-core communist sympathizers can have a day of clarity.&nbsp; Annenberg’s solstice of sanity
ended with a winter chill.&nbsp; As the end of Eisenhower’s second term
neared, the Kennedy clan courted the powerful publisher’s for support
in the 1960 elections: “Vice-President and Mrs. Nixon were hosts at a
small dinner party in their Forest Lane home last night to Mr. and Mrs.
Norman Chandler and Mr. and Mrs. Otis Chandler[;] Mr. and Mrs. Walter
Annenberg; [and] British Ambassador Sir Harold Caccia.”<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/breaking-news-o.html/#4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p><em>Now wait one minute</em>—why’s the financial backer of Ayer’s
“enrichment” camps dining with Nixon and British Ambassadors on the eve
of an election?&nbsp; Soviet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a>? We’re talking about the man who green-lit Howard K. Smith’s 1959 hit-piece, “The Political Obiturary of Richard M. Nixon”:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]wo stations, WNHC-TV in New Haven and WFIL-TV in
Philadelphia . . . blacked out not only the original telecast but even
a reference to the program in a straight news report 24 hours later[.] 
The owner of the outlets, Walter Annenberg . . . could have readily
added an editorial footnote disagreeing with the program without going
to the extreme measure of total suppression.<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/breaking-news-o.html/#5">[5]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><em>The fuck</em>?&nbsp; This is the same Arab-loving Annenberg whose papers slandered the Israelis at the outset of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War">Six-Day War</a>, claiming the deaths of three Israel soldiers on November 11<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>th</sup></span> had been faked as a pretext to send 4,000 heavily-armed soldiers into a town of 3,000, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Es_Samu">as-Samu</a>, in order to secure water for the nearby settlements of Ma’on and Asa’el.&nbsp; As M.S. Handler wrote in <em>The New York Times</em>: “Walter Annenberg, publisher of <em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em>, was reported by his&nbsp; &nbsp;newspaper to have contributed $1 million.”<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/breaking-news-o.html/#6">[6]</a> His own newspaper reported that he donated an inflation-adjusted <strong>$6,928,926.20 million</strong> to the United Jewish Appeal’s Israel Emergency Fund—<em>what</em>?</p>
<p><em>Shut up</em>.&nbsp; Annenberg approved Ayers’s grant application.&nbsp; He hears
capitalism’s death-rattle.&nbsp; He thinks the New Deal proves Marx correct
about socialism being a stepping stone to capitalism.&nbsp; He and his
friends finance the overthrow of the American government.&nbsp; Remember
Norman Chandler, Annenberg’s co-conspirator in the communist plot to
infiltrate Nixon’s dining room?&nbsp; Raping the American way of life <em>to death</em>
is the first thing he thinks about in the morning and the last thing he
thinks about night.&nbsp; Like Annenberg, he hires inexperienced college
kids to run multi-billion dollar enterprises into the ground:</p>
<blockquote><p>Norman Chandler, chairman and chief executive officer
[of Times Mirror Co.], announced Wednesday [that] Walter H. Annenberg,
president of Triangle Publications, Inc., was elected a director of
Times Mirror at the company’s board meeting . . . Annenberg is also a
director of Campbell Soup Co., the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. and Girard
Trust Bank.<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/breaking-news-o.html/#7">[7]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><em>Just hold those horses</em>—Obama’s an acolyte of an anti-American
<em>terrorist</em> funded by Annenberg.&nbsp; Annenberg supports terrorism.&nbsp; He’s not
a close personal friend of GOP elite.</p>
<blockquote><p>A Nixon spokesman described [them] as the two families’&nbsp; &nbsp;closest and most personal friends.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to <em>The New York Times</em> article about the plan to secure a truce between rival factions the heathen way—<em>i.e.</em>
by exploiting the sacred bond of marriage for crass political ends—the
“two families” in question were the Husseins and al-Sauds.</p>
<blockquote><p>Former President Eisenhower’s only grandson, Dwight
David Eisenhower, and President-elect Richard M. Nixon’s younger
daughter, Julie, were married yesterday . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>But Annenberg wasn’t there.&nbsp; He was out aiding and abetting peace-loving—</p>
<blockquote><p>. . . at a dignified ceremony with Quaker touches.</p></blockquote>
<p>They were superficial!</p>
<blockquote><p>Julie, who considers herself a Quaker, asked Dr. Peale
and her bridegroom to use the Quaker “thee” and “thou” throughout the
service.</p></blockquote>
<p>SUPERFICIAL!&nbsp; Besides, what has this got to do with the man behind the terrorist behind Obama?</p>
<blockquote><p>Guests included Walter Annen—</p></blockquote>
<p>UNDER DURESS so he could experience FREEDOM first-hand!</p>
<blockquote><p>—berg, the Philadelphia Publisher at whose—</p></blockquote>

		<span id="comment-130672726-content"><p>The problem is that it&#39;s not Annenberg&#39;s character at issue here.  It&#39;s Obama&#39;s.  And it&#39;s quite easy to tar Obama with Ayers&#39;s criminal actions.  (I mean, Ayers would have been jailed for a long time had the FBI not fucked up their investigation of the WU.)</p>

<p>Clearly, Ayers has changed; it&#39;s been years since he helped build bombs and blew shit up.  But Obama is gonna catch a beating for his association with Ayers.  We can complain that Ayers is funded now by conservative quadrillionaires, but I can already see the populace falling asleep before that justification is half articulated.  </p>

<p>Sadly, the only way to stop this sort of bullshit politics is the tu quoque.  So we have to find McCain saying &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; to excuse Obama, or we have to point to Obama to excuse Palin&#39;s lack of experience.  The only way the Ayers story will stop snowballing is if we can attach McCain to some similarly dastardly character.  </p></span>

If it doesn&#39;t snowball after that, the media view it as already having been introduced, and that&#39;s it.  Ayers is now old news.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why McCain has been going after increasingly obvious lies such as the &quot;Obama wants to teach kindergardeners about sex&quot; one.  They already shot their best material.  They can&#39;t go back to it now.</p></span>

Woke up early. Did one last read-through. Handed it into the printer by 10:00 a.m. Specified paper weight and margin width. They said give them half an hour. I walk across the bridge to campus with my signature page. Try to get Second Reader to sign it. He won't sign it until my chair signs it. I email my my chair. He says he can't sign it until he arrives home at 4:00 p.m. Says I should drive up to his place and he'll sign it. I say I'll see him then. Third Reader's signatures are in the mail but didn't arrive with it. The department secretary immediately phones Third Reader. He assures her he'd sent it UPS. Not campus mail. Not FedEx. The library archives—housed in that library—close at 5:00 p.m. It is now 12:00 p.m. I walk back across the bridge to the printer. They handed me two copies of my dissertation in boxes. The boxes say &quot;Copy Paper&quot; on them. The woman behind the counter rings me up. My total comes to $41.00. Or approximately nine fewer dollars than the cost of a box of the specified 20-lb 100 percent cotton bond. I open one box. It is my dissertation. Yay! Printed on copy paper. Boo! I mention the error. Show the woman my copy of the order. She needs to talk to her manager. He is exasperated. Says to do my order again. Says this order will come out of her next paycheck. She says it will be about half an hour. It is now 1:00 p.m. I return to the department and check the mail. Nothing from Third Reader. Department secretary says not to worry. The UPS guy arrives late. I don't worry much. I still have four hours. I double-check my paper-work. I FORGOT TO PRINT OUT MY EXIT QUESTIONNAIRE! IT IS ALL OVER! Department secretary says not to worry. Says I can walk to Graduate Studies and print it out. I do. I can. I return to the department. Still no mail. Wait a minute—we still may have mail. No! It is now 2:00 p.m. I return to the printer. I am handed two boxes. They say 20-lb 100 percent cotton bond on them. I open one up. It is my dissertation. Yay! Printed on the proper paper. Yay! With new margins. Boo! I mention the error. The woman denies it. I show her my table of contents. Show her where it says CHAPTER TWO begins on page 81. Pull out the first page of CHAPTER TWO. Point to the page number at the bottom. Ask her whether 76 and 81 are the same number. She needs to talk to her manager. He is exasperated. She is exasperated. She is told to be exasperated at home. The manager apologizes. Explains he charged her for the mistake. That she must have widened the margins to keep down her costs. Says I still need to pay for the paper. I...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/galveston-1900.html"><span><strong>Galveston, 1900-2008?</strong> As Ike bears down on his namesake's home state of Texas, it behooves us to remember what Ari wrote a few days back. The only element absent from Ari's post was the reaction of the rest of the country. The first chapter of Erik Larson's excellent recreation of Galveston's last hours, Isaac's Storm, reads: TELEGRAM Washington, D.C. Sept. 9, 1900 To: Manager, Western Union Houston, Texas Did you hear anything about Galveston? Willis L. Moore We already know the answer---in 1900, everyone was confused. On Wednesday, September 4th, the Louisville-based Christian Observer reported that &quot;all the great damage done to the roads [in Puerto Rico] by the hurricane of August 8, 1899, has been repaired.&quot;[1] By the time anyone read that article, the pluperfect had supplanted the perfect: another nameless storm had already slammed into the island and re-destroyed its infrastructure. The New York Times tracked the storm in its daily weather bulletins: For those of you with eyes like mine, I'll transcribe the important bits: September 5: &quot;The tropical storm was moving over Western Cuba in a northerly direction last night, and had increased somewhat in intensity. It has thus far caused rains through a portion of Cuba, and brisk to high northeasterly winds, which have extended as far north as Jupiter, Fla.&quot; September 6: &quot;The tropical storm was central last night near Key West, Fla., and has increased greatly in intensity. It has caused northeast gales over Southern Florida, and is moving slowly northward. The storm will cause high winds and general rains over the eastern portion of the country, and will probably terminate the high temperature period.&quot; It's in poor taste to mock forecasts before the Live StormTrack 8000 Triple Doppler Radar Slaves™ made it to Moline, so I won't say a word---I'll italicize theirs instead: September 7: &quot;The tropical storm continued slowly northwestward, and was apparently central last night over the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, and has still a tendency toward a northwesterly direction. Note how on September 6th, &quot;The Weather&quot; columnist---for the sake of clarity, I'll pretend one person's responsible---confidently declares the storm's &quot;moving slowly northward.&quot; He's pinpointed the speed and direction of the storm and stated them in no uncertain terms. Now, note how on September 7th, this same person rewrites the history it mis-predicted: saying the storm &quot;continued slowly northwestward&quot; creates the impression it has been and &quot;still&quot; is headed &quot;northwesterly.&quot; But it hasn't and it ain't. It's &quot;apparently&quot; headed northwesterly now, but under what or whose power?
