<p>Meat which, serial punster I am, is very much about meat.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You see, back when I was in high school, I converted to ethical vegetarianism.&nbsp; Being the serious sort (and an athlete), I quickly decided my ethical vegetarianism needed to be taken to the next level.&nbsp; So I gave veganism 110% for the better part of two years.&nbsp; Were it not for a beautiful woman and a Louisiana concoction called a &quot;deep-fried 'grilled'-cheese sandwich&quot;—the irony is duly noted, but in the South, if it ain't boiled blisteringly spicy or deep-fried, it ain't fit for consumption—I might very well be the same annoyingly proselytizing gink I was then.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Tainted by the power of cheese and general allure of dairy, eventually my ethical objections sloughed away and I considered eating meat again.&nbsp; Well, that and an article in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine </em>arguing that people who ate red meat and chicken but no fish developed Alzheimer's-like symptoms.&nbsp; I didn't eat red meat or chicken, but I also didn't eat fish, which meant that I'd start suffering from Alzheimer's-like symptoms <em>any day now</em>.&nbsp; I started eating fish.&nbsp; Even convinced a few other people to.&nbsp; (So maybe I'm <em>not </em>not the annoyingly proselytizing gink I was then.)&nbsp; </p>

<p>Considering what 99.99% of the population ate, I was a god amongst nutritionists.&nbsp; Guzzling green tea, inhaling everything soy, eating fresh fish, working out four times a week—you know, the kind of guy everyone loves to loathe.&nbsp; Like <a href="http://grannyvibe.blogspot.com/2006/08/international-fuck-broccoli-day.html">Granny</a>, I was positive I'd bought myself a couple extra decades on this mortal coil before anyone demanded I shuffle off ... then the test came back positive and it turned out I didn't.&nbsp; All those years of &quot;healthy&quot; living turned out not to be so healthy.&nbsp; </p>

<p>How did I respond?&nbsp; I ditched vegetarianism.&nbsp; In stages.&nbsp; I began with a little chicken.&nbsp; Sharing a table with General Tso again was a life-altering experience.&nbsp; Still, it was months before I graduated to pork, and I have yet to matriculate in the School of Red Meat.&nbsp; (I tried a few weeks back but failed &quot;disastrously.&quot;&nbsp; That <em>is</em> a euphemism for what you think it is.)&nbsp; All of which brings me to tonight's quiz:</p><blockquote><p><strong>What did Scott prepare for dinner tonight?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_22401,00.html">Smothered Pork Chops</a> <br />B.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_10770,00.html">Pan Fried Pork Chops</a><br />C.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_20641,00.html">Stuffed Grilled Pork Chops</a><br />D.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.officialtomwaits.com/music/m_nd_lyr.htm#Eggs_And_Sausage">Eggs and Sausage and a Side of Toast</a>*</strong></p></blockquote><p>The winner of tonight's quiz will recieve an offer to replicate said dinner at some point in the (no doubt far distant) future.&nbsp; The answer is not as clear-cut as it may seem.&nbsp; Some knowledge of the Food Channel and apartment living is required ... but may also throw you off my scent, as I'm a creative mutt sometimes, fully able to ignore fire-regulations in a single bound.**</p>

<p>* When I searched for a very common slang term meaning &quot;debilitatingly soused,&quot; I came across these <a href="http://www.chrismclaren.com/blog/wp-content/images/2006/01/tom_gr.jpg">two</a> <a href="http://www.albeshiloh.com/josskeith.jpg">pictures</a>.&nbsp; Hence, the change in direction.&nbsp; But don't you love the synchronicity there?&nbsp; That of all the people in the world, <em>those two </em>would be the ones who were the ones who were the ones?&nbsp; (To paraphrase one of them.)</p>

<p>** Yes, dinner-blogging is a new nadir.&nbsp; But I want to write, demand an audience, and the post I tried to write arrived stillborn.&nbsp; What's a guy to do?&nbsp; Not write at all?&nbsp; No, no, of course that's correct.&nbsp; Better nothing than this, but still, if John &amp; Belle can toddler-blog, I can solips ... no, I see what you mean now.&nbsp; If only I hadn't hit post!</p>

He even takes a (respectful) shot or two at Pinker&#39;s <i>Animal Liberation</i>...</p>

I meant to reference the thyroid cancer, but one doesn&#39;t talk about that being &quot;positive&quot; out of context.  It came back positive as &quot;malignant,&quot; instead of benign.</p>

<p>Brian and Casey, two good guesses; both, however, were wrong.  I would&#39;ve done C, but my tiny grill&#39;s on the porch and I have to lug it to the park to use it (apartment regulations).  That said, you guys had the right logic, only a limited understanding of my current apartment situation.  I opted for the Southern goodness of B. </p>

<p>Casey, <i>are you trying to get me in trouble</i>?  (You&#39;re not.  The Little Womedievalist would get the Tom Waits reference and swoon.)</p>

<p>Mike, yes, kosher hasn&#39;t been in my vocabulary for some time ... and yet, we still own two sets of forks and spoons.  Go figure.</p></span>

(A quasi-re-tapping later followed, so I'm answering that one two, I guess.) I began writing this then, but am finishing it tonight. I only mention this because I am, to quote Jonathan Swift, &quot;sick as a Cushion, [and] want nothing but stuffing.&quot; Feeding the fever, indeed. Before doing so, however, I want to update you on Festival of Self-Congratulation mentioned Saturday. It continues. New charges include &quot;plagiarizing things outright&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld impressions.&quot; It seems our dear Troll's unable to differentiate between quotation and plagiarism. (Another reason for his failure to earn the degrees he sought, perhaps?) For her part, Colonel Moutarde has taken to chastizing The Valve for the way in which its contributors responded to Franco Moretti. Like all accusations of professional and intellectual envy, hers contains what it diagnoses in spades. Now, on to the show, in which I'm asked to name: 1. One book that changed your life? Questions like this are burdend with an implicit &quot;for the better.&quot; Some books really change you; however, they don't do so &quot;for the better.&quot; So I'm going to go with Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus. It ignited an already waxing interest in Theory—but that's not quite true. A combination of it and the explosively brilliant guy who taught the seminar on it, John Protevi, sent me scrambling. Then again, said scrambling contributed to my admission here, so I don't want to disown its impetus ... but I do sometimes wonder where and what I'd be if I'd never come to Irvine. (The answer, as previously noted, involves real estate.) The other candidate for this one is The Crying of Lot 49. The story accompanyinig that answer is far too long to relate here. Needless to say it involves a student teacher I crushed hard on; a book I bought from her husband's used bookstore; my employment at said bookstore; the creation of a crude database of Lot 49 and various other attempts to &quot;solve&quot; its mysteries; hitting on a new employee with talk of Lot 49 and the proper washing lettuce; and, finally, the wedding of the aforementioned new employee (charmed by talk of Pynchon and pesticide) and myself in which the man whose wife I'd crushed hard on stood beside me as my best man. See what I mean? Complicated. 2. One book you have read more than once? I like Kevin's answer, but I demur and go with simple addition. I've read Gravity's Rainbow eleven times, Ulysses six, and Moby Dick too many times to count. Gravity's Rainbow and Ulysses I can count re-readings confidently because I can track my marginalia in the various editions littering the apartment.

You have murder on your mind. What are you listening to? Me: Belle and Sebastian. Her: You threaten fuckers with Belle and Sebastian? You're twice the bad-ass I thought, pops. Me: My ass ain't bad, thank you very much. Now, if you'll excuse me, it seems I have a class to menace ...</span></a></div>
