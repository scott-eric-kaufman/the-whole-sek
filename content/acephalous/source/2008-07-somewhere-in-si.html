Somewhere in Silas Weir Mitchell's voluminous correspondence on the brain damage of Civil War veterans—my notes are in California, I'm now in Texas—is an account of a Confederate soldier whose bullet-struck head recoiled into a dry-stone wall and performed a fortuitous auto-trepanation. The insult to his brain had been mitigated by the hole in head, but Mitchell feared the soldier would never regain normal cognitive function. As time tripped over nothing, cursed in tongues, begged passersby for aid and, roundly rebuffed, stumbled on, the soldier slowly found himself again. Eventually he could move, see, speak, form new memories and remember the old ones. He was as he'd been before the war, but for the brutal fact he saw in still life: The dog is across the room curled before the fire. Blink. The dog is on its hind legs staring out the window. Blink. The dog is in the middle of the room facing him. Blink. The dog is sinking its wet nose into the crook of his arm. Blink. The dog is across the room curled before the fire. The soldier suffered what we now call akinetopsia or motion blindess.* The effect represented by crude blinks above is better, if more crudely, represented about 5 minutes and 14 seconds into this clip, which captures the fear and paranoia Mitchell assumed would accompany akinetopsia. Items like fans would be particularly disturbing because they produced a constant impression upon the skin by a process undetectable to the patient, for whom the blades would jump—jump—jump instead of spinning. But Mitchell was less concerned with akinetopsia itself than one of its side-effects: the ghostly motion trails produced by items in motion. Stand before a motion-blind person, do a jumping jack, and he will describe two scenes: a first in which your arms are at your sides, and a second in which your arms stand solid above your head, but are followed by a faint trace of the space they traveled, like the long exposure photograph on the right (original) only far less pronounced. Mitchell believed these traces might be related to what would have been his crowning achievement were it not for Charlotte Perkins Gilman: phantom limb syndrome. Normal brains need not speculate as to how your arm moved from Point A to Point B because it registered Points A.001 up through A.999; that is, it receives sequential sense impressions of your arm as it travels from hips to head.** A motion-blind brain only receives sensory impressions from Points A and B, but because it knows arms must move through space, it compensates for what it can't perceive by drawing diaphanous snow-angels in the air. It does so, Mitchell believed, because even damaged brains know how they ought to behave. They know what stimuli they should be receiving and, in their absence, choose to receive them anyway.

<p>Somewhere in Silas Weir Mitchell's voluminous correspondence on the brain damage of Civil War veterans—my notes are in California, I'm now in Texas—is an account of a Confederate soldier whose bullet-struck head recoiled into a dry-stone wall and performed a fortuitous <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/2008/01/an_illustrated_history_of_trep.php">auto-trepanation</a>.&nbsp; The insult to his brain had been mitigated by the hole in head, but Mitchell feared the soldier would never regain normal cognitive function.&nbsp; As time tripped over nothing, cursed in tongues, begged passersby for aid and, roundly rebuffed, stumbled on, the soldier slowly found himself again.&nbsp; Eventually he could move, see, speak, form new memories and remember the old ones.&nbsp; He was as he'd been before the war, but for the brutal fact he saw in still life:&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<blockquote><p>The dog is across the room curled before the fire.&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>Blink.&nbsp; </em></p>

<p>The dog is on its hind legs staring out the window.&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>Blink.&nbsp; </em></p>

<p>The dog is in the middle of the room facing him.&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>Blink.&nbsp; </em></p>

<p>The dog is sinking its wet nose into the crook of his arm.&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>Blink.</em></p>

<p>The dog is across the room curled before the fire.</p></blockquote>





<p>The soldier suffered what we now call akinetopsia or motion blindess.*&nbsp; The effect represented by crude blinks above is better, if more crudely, represented about 5 minutes and 14 seconds into <a href="http://www.trilulilu.ro/Macei/bcde7544882643">this clip</a>, which captures the fear and paranoia Mitchell assumed would accompany akinetopsia.&nbsp; Items like fans would be particularly disturbing because they produced a constant impression upon the skin by a process undetectable to the patient, for whom the blades would jump—jump—jump instead of spinning.&nbsp; But Mitchell was less concerned with akinetopsia itself than one of its side-effects:

<p>Normal brains need not speculate as to how your arm moved from Point A to Point B because it registered Points A.001 up through A.999; that is, it receives sequential sense impressions of your arm as it travels from hips to head.**&nbsp; A motion-blind brain only receives sensory impressions from Points A and B, but because it knows arms must move through space, it compensates for what it can't perceive by drawing diaphanous snow-angels in the air.&nbsp; It does so, Mitchell believed, because even damaged brains know how they ought to behave.&nbsp; They know what stimuli they should be receiving and, in their absence, choose to receive them anyway.&nbsp; For Mitchell, the brain is but a forlorn lover refusing to acknowledge its loss: lop off an arm at the elbow and it will insist on clenching former fingers in an invisible fist; chop off a leg above the knee and unreal calves will burn with the exertion of a marathon completed.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The ghostly trails seen by the motion-blind are simply a different manifestation of the same stubborn insistence Nothing has Changed and Everything is Under Control.&nbsp; The brain insists on stasis while compensating madly, all the while praying the mind never notices its frenzied machinations.</p>

<p>Sometimes it does.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Every time it steps into the city it does.&nbsp; Imagine being motion-blind on a bustling street corner with hundreds of vehicles teleporting blocks, their trails overlapping and intermingling with those of trucks turning left, cabs turning right, pedestrians hustling, pigeons scattering, garbage flying, dust rising, wind whipping, rain falling.&nbsp; The mind becomes exhausted by the brain's exertions.&nbsp; Put differently:</p>

<p>The brain finds it difficult to confabulate in real time when presented with minimal stimuli.&nbsp; Offer it a highly trafficked Philadelphia street corner and it performs like a self-taught cook in a trendy restaurant: the first few orders trickle in and go out fine, but as more people arrive and more orders come in, less time is spent preparing more food until what little goes out tastes of shit.&nbsp; Given foreknowledge of what would be ordered by whom when, our home-schooled chef might could prep himself into something resembling competent; that is, if presented with a narrative, an adequately prepared amateur might survive evening service by remembering the broad strokes.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Because for Mitchell, narrative is all that stands between us and tastes of shit.&nbsp; The historian is kin to our overwhelmed chef, our motion-blind pedestrian, our auto-trepanned soldier attempting to relate what happened without the benefit of an overarching narrative.&nbsp; The historian not only tries to document Points A.001 through A.999, he interleaves a marching causality of the insignificant and irrelevant until the Real Reasons and True Character of historical actors are swamped by waves as pointless as they are ceaseless.&nbsp; What does a person learn from such history?</p>

<p>If it looks and sounds like a horse, it's probably a zebra.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The only way to be sure people recognize a horse when they see one is to tattoo the concept on their brain in stirring historical romances of crystalline moral intent and transparent moral purpose.&nbsp; The historian who subdivides unto infinity produces a history equivalent to the blurred image of the motion-blind.&nbsp; Why recreate in prose the muddle of a brain insulted?&nbsp; To try and replicate the exertions of a healthy brain is to court inevitable failure.&nbsp; </p>

		<span id="comment-124466592-content"><p>This reminds me of a passage in *The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time*, where the autistic narrator is discussing the illusion most people share of their self as a homunculus looking through a window onto the world.  In reality, he tells us, &quot;the mind is just a complicated machine . . . We&#39;re looking at a screen inside our heads, like a computer screen&quot; (116).</p>

<p>He goes on to describe saccades tests: &quot;And this is because when your eye flicks from one point to another you don&#39;t see anything at all and you&#39;re blind.  And the flicks are called saccades.  Because if you saw everything when your eye flicked from one point to another you&#39;d feel giddy . . . But you don&#39;t notice that you&#39;re blind during saccades because your brain fills the screen in your head to make it seem like you&#39;re looking out of two little windows in your head . . . And people are different from animals because they can have pictures on the screens in their heads of things which they are not looking at&quot; (117, &quot;saccades&quot; italicized throughout).  </p>

<p>So it seems that the brain (a) filters too many impressions and (b) fills in and smooths over what it filters.  It would be interesting to compare this to Simmel&#39;s phenomenology of modern life, so influential on Benjamin&#39;s ideas about true experience versus packaged experience.</p></span>

<p>Not particularly -- it&#39;s part of my attempt to rewrite sections of my dissertation far from the date of composition and without sources, so that they might, I don&#39;t know, read better?  Because my chapters feel like akinetopsic snapshots in need of a brain-smoothing, and I thought this might be one way to do it.</p>

<p><em>It would be interesting to compare this to Simmel&#39;s phenomenology of modern life, so influential on Benjamin&#39;s ideas about true experience versus packaged experience.</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I want to blow meta- at this point, LB, but it&#39;s something I&#39;m looking forward to researching once I file the dissertation.  I&#39;m less interested in how-the-mind-really-reads-literature than I am how-people-thought-it-did, if only because, as with Mitchell, the explanations are typically wacky.</p>

<p><em>some of your best writing yet.</em></p>

<p>Wahoo!  Praise from someone who would know!  (Seriously, this is the sort of material I&#39;m trying to put in the diss.  I actually sought out that picture so that I might better describe the trails.)</p>

<p><em>neither requiring nor proscribing hallucinogens</em></p>

As the premier Dark Knight poster ’round these parts, it has been demanded of, er, falls upon me to draw your attention to an interview with Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale in which the pair reveal their Batman is based on Edmund Morris’ The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt and Theodore Rex.* In the interview, Bale admits to confusion when the Nolans — brother Jonathan co-writes Christopher’s films — insisted he read The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt before they began principle photography on Batman Begins. Nolan then explains (and I paraphrase): Batman’s not as unique as people think. Grant Bob Kane’s Gotham is New York and Batman has a direct historical precedent in Theodore Roosevelt. His father, Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., had been one of the city’s preeminent philanthropists — having found and funded the New York City Children’s Aid Society, the Met, and the American Museum of Natural History, to name a few of his charitable works — and died in a way Morris contends traumatized his son: suddenly, from a cancer whose existence he’d hidden, and mere hours before Theodore returned from Harvard. In 1884, his beloved mother and wife died in the same house, on the same day. A bereft Roosevelt set out for the Dakota Territory shortly thereafter. He spent his time in the hinterlands learning how to be a proper police, then applied those lessons when he became president of the New York City Police Commissioners in 1895. Like Batman, Roosevelt employed bleeding-edge technology into his crime-fighting: under his watch, telephones were installed in precincts, bicycles were deployed on beats, and various criminal identification systems, like Bertillonage, were monkeyed about with. Nolan’s statement resonates with many a recent discussion about the Roosevelt’s legacy vis-a-vis the current administration. If Bush-is-Batman and Batman-is-Roosevelt, logic demands that middle be distributed and then it’s case closed, verdict delivered, suit settle, put a period on it already: Bush-is-as-Batman as Socrates-is-mortal. The which-president-is-more-Airwolf-Batman debate aside, Nolan’s decision to craft Batman’s appeal after Roosevelt’s is ridiculously savvy, inasmuch as it speaks to that most cherished (if post-dated) primal American myths: self-invention. In Batman Begins, the young Bruce Wayne isn’t some spectacular physical specimen; in fact, he’s thin, fragile, and perpetually frightened. Nolan’s direction reinforces this: he’s either in tears, bed, or the bottom of a well in every shot. Even Bale’s adolescent Wayne, returned from school for Chill’s parole hearing, buries a wisp-thin frame beneath layers of clothes as if to prevent circumstance from buffeting his head into a doorknob. The first act of Batman Begins plays directly into the Roosevelt mystique, i.e. the frail boy who refines his body into a weapon. The first film ends, then, much where Morris’ Rise does: his reputation established, his name to be reckoned with, but his future uncertain. Where does this self-made man fit in the political machine in which he’ll have to function? What compromises must he make? What ideals must he betray in order to act upon? I can’t do much in the...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/07/handcrafted-in.html"><span><strong>Handcrafted in solid 24-karat FAIL</strong> (x-posted nowhere! Totally original Acephalous content! Must cite me!) To counter recent accusations of poetry and overcompensation, an example of what the inmates write when the guards clock out: [In the chapters to follow,] I will demonstrate the pervasive influence of these non-Darwinian theories of evolution on late 19th and early 20th Century American literature, paying particular attention to how the haphazard traffic of scientific ideas in intellectual circles alters our understanding of theories of romance, realism, and naturalism. To build on the traffic metaphor, picture an account of these three novelistic modes as an interstate traveling in two directions: north represents a progressive commitment to social betterment through science, south a conservative commitment to the agrarian ideals of the early Republic. In the conventional account, realism and naturalism occupy the northbound lanes, romance the southbound. The realists responsibly drive Honda Accords north, five miles per hour below the posted speed limit; the naturalists muscle Ford Mustangs between them—one hand on the wheel, the other on the stereo—thirty miles per hour above the limit; while the romancers, they plod south, in aggressively polished Bentleys, driven by the help. The forced homogeneity is meant to be instructive: not all Japanese cars are Hondas, nor are they all driven impeccably; not all American cars Fords, nor do they all careen by whim of inattentive hand; and not all European cars Bentleys, nor are they all piloted with soft disgust by the help. But my metaphor's limitations parallel those of the conventional account, inasmuch as both betray an underdeveloped appreciation for detail and an overweening urge to categorize. A more accurate metaphor of the cultural scene, circa 1900, would have all three modes traveling north, as all three are equally committed—albeit distinctively, as will be demonstrated in the chapters to follow—to a broad conception of social development via applied science. In this account, self-proclaimed realists sport makes and models from across Japan and Southeast Asia: a Honda Civic jockeys with a Toyota Tundra for inside position until a naturalist in a Pontiac Grand Prix emerges from the shadow of a Chevy Silverado and cuts the corner and secures the lane occupied by a southbound-facing romancer in Rolls Royce who slams into reverse and proceeds north, backwards, as best he can. This final image—a menagerie of law-abiding Southeast Asian imports hurtling north alongside masculine American machines as both dodge Old World status symbols whose terrified drivers mistakenly believe everyone else wildfires north in the southbound lane—this final, chaotic image closely approximates the bounded diversity of turn-of-the-last-century American culture. Generalizations remain, certainly, but unlike the conventional account, they exist in a manner suitable to and for further differentiation. All Japanese and Southeast Asian cars are not Accords or even Hondas, nor are all American cars Fords, and so on. Moreover, while the driver of a speeding American SUV shares some beliefs and dispositions with the cautious driver of a American coupe, he may share other, more important ones with the driver of a Rolls Royce...</span></a></div>
