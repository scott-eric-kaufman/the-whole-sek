<p>Scott, doesn&#39;t your question--insofar as you pun on the word &quot;class&quot;--answer itself? (But maybe your pun is unintentional, in which case we&#39;ll have to recapitulate the discussion of the unconscious...:) Seriously: despite our different political leanings--which we see as wildly divergent and hugely consequential (and people further right find to be inconsequential entirely, for various reasons)--we&#39;re all basically the same class. And thus, we <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674212770/" rel="nofollow">share tastes</a>.</p></span>

Sure, most of us are currently and/or are destined to belong to the same class, but I doubt we all came from it.  I&#39;m of the school that &quot;what you listened to when you were younger largely determines what you&#39;ll find acceptable when older&quot; school of taste theory, so I think where we come from more important than where we are and/or are going.  I still associate with my lower- and lower-middle class roots, despite my current situation.  I know other people in my department in the same boat, and who have the same taste as our Harvard and Yale-bred compatriots.  </p>

<p>And <i>wow</i> do I ever have specific examples in mind.  I mean, as I type they&#39;re all making the long trek back from Coachella.  They have the money to attend year after year.  I don&#39;t.  But if I did I would . . . which seems to indicate that I have unfilfilled aspirations, even though that strikes me as a ludicrous explanation as to why I like the music I do.  Not that your point is ludicrous, mind you, I&#39;d just need some connection between material circumstances and issues of taste which, well, convince me that what I like is determined by class-affiliation.  </p>

<p>Also, can class really explain the difference between the jazz fan and the Wilco fanatic in any meaningful way?  (Or the Deleuzian from the new historicist, for that matter?)</p></span>

Are we all just former losers, united in our loserdom, who decide to make other former losers into multi-millionaires in order to satisfy our sense of justice?  </p>

<p>Plus, that fails to explain our love of beautiful people who happen to appeal to losers.  I mean, by most everyone&#39;s account, Morrissey is one of the most beautifully androgynous people ever to walk the earth.  I&#39;ve heard tell from straight women, gay men, lip-stick lesbians, granola girls and members of the trans-community (all self-identified, so that all know I mean no offense) all state that Morrissey is the most beautiful human they&#39;ve ever laid eyes upon.  He&#39;s an uber-democratic Adonis, he is, and should be shunned by losers like us.  Instead we embrace him.  I sense confusion ahead, I say . . . </p></span>

<p>Well, my point was that we all <em><strong>now</strong> identify with</em> the same class, definitely not that we all <em>came from</em> the same class (because I don&#39;t really have any way of knowing that). But even so, I would (tentatively) argue that we <em>always did identify with</em> the same class, which explains why we&#39;re a bunch of worthless grad students who already identify with the professorial class.</p>

<p>And that always-having-identified-with accounts for our love of the same music over the course of several years when our actual class situations might not have been quite &quot;the same.&quot;</p>

<p>At any rate, to the extent that Anthony&#39;s right, it&#39;s perhaps because we trust each other (when it comes to music). So for instance, Scott, you probably didn&#39;t discover John Vanderslice but you passed the word on from that &quot;same person,&quot; and now I like Vanderslice too. And with Neko, we just got our news (originating from the &quot;same person&quot;) through slightly differently articulated networks.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-16753767-content"><p>Not to play the immigrant card here, but I have to say, my musical tastes come wayyy out of left field.  I, like you, Scott, had a low and eventually low-middle class upbringing, but I can&#39;t say where I started getting better taste in music. It surely wasn&#39;t my childhood, in which my older (then teenage) siblings, in their attempts to assimilate, brought home Air Supply, Chicago, REO Speedwagon, Michael Jackson, and Boy George records and emblazoned Pee Chee folders (or was it Mead, whatever).  I actually had a Boy George folder to carry my Kindergarten homework in. It was embarassing. The New Wave years were better for me, but I am sure it was disturbing to see a child sing &quot;Whip it! Whip it good!&quot; Fast forward to high school, when I was finally developing tastes of my own not entirely formed by the weekly (and free, we couldn&#39;t afford cable MTV) edition of Sooouuul Traiiin!  Unfortunately, I went to high school in Orange County, CA...during the height of OC ska and neo-Swing revival.  The ska remake of &quot;Come on Eileen&quot; still plagues me. I hung out with kids who listened to really bad R&amp;B and hip hop though.  To this day, I like 80&#39;s music, punk, and have learned what good R&amp;B and rap is by having lived through the bad.</p>

<p>So how did we, from such different backgrounds, class strata, and the unamed elephant in the room, races and ethnicities all come to converge?  My theory is a combination of yours (Scott&#39;s) and Rodney&#39;s--aspiration and identification.  </p>

<p>Scott: &quot;which seems to indicate that I have unfilfilled aspirations, even though that strikes me as a ludicrous explanation as to why I like the music I do. Not that your point is ludicrous, mind you, I&#39;d just need some connection between material circumstances and issues of taste which, well, convince me that what I like is determined by class-affiliation.&quot;</p>

<p>Rodney: &quot;my point was that we all now identify with the same class, definitely not that we all came from the same class (because I don&#39;t really have any way of knowing that). But even so, I would (tentatively) argue that we always did identify with the same class, which explains why we&#39;re a bunch of worthless grad students who already identify with the professorial class.nd that always-having-identified-with accounts for our love of the same music over the course of several years when our actual class situations might not have been quite &quot;the same.&quot;</p>

<p>All through my musically inane childhood, I was at least exposed, to some degree, to what I _should_ have been listening to in addition to what I was already listening to. Every kid, even an immigrant one, grows up hearing about the Beatles.   Even if you go to a high school where everyone has appalling taste in music, there&#39;s always the salvation of college and the chance meeting of an earnest young man who wants to impress you by showing you an album &quot;that will change your life.&quot;  There were many ways in which I aspired to leave the meaness and coarseness of poverty behind and become &quot;cultured&quot;--I am a jazz fan and a classical music aficionado--but there are many ways that in doing so, you feel another type of poverty, and a need to reconnect with your &quot;roots&quot; and that sense of loneliness that comes with being torn from within--and so I am also a Wilco fan.  And once I got to college and law school, I kept meeting more earnest young men and women who grew up with different backgrounds and incomes and record collections, but with a common sense of nerdiness and loneliness that comes with spinning records in your room by yourself until the late hours.  That&#39;s when the poetry of the lyrics gets to you. And how you connect to others like you, the other lone wolfs.  College is a great democratizing experience--thousands of heads bobbing to the same song, thousands of kids thinking they&#39;ve discovered this new and totally different indie band themselves, and the inner cry of &quot;righteous, man&quot; bursting forth from each heart. </p>

<p>Finally, what I think unites us all, regardless of caste, class, or academic discipline:  we&#39;re all lyrical souls.  Those who actually listen/read the lyrics of the songs will always love the good songs by the good bands. This is why I love &quot;The River&quot; and &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.&quot;  And Jeff Buckley and Eliot Smith make me cry, and I like that. </p>

<p>Music is whatever moves you, man.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-16765134-content"><p>Ben, methinks you confuse Calexico with Mexicali.  Mexicali&#39;s in Mexico, Calexico the States.  It&#39;s a notorious launching pad for illegals, which is what I think Morrissey was refering to, there.</p>

<p>Rodney, I&#39;m still not buying it.  As a junior in high school with a 1.2 GPA, I didn&#39;t think I was going to college, much less end up in graduate school, <i>and yet</i> I still loved R.E.M., The Replacements and The Pixies.  The idea that class explains it all strikes me as too pat, unable to account for the complexities of class origin, regional bias and plain ol&#39; pure contingency.  I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s wrong, really, but it just seems strange that a working-class  Southern Jew and, to use the only person whose history I&#39;m familiar with, a working-class Asian-American woman from Orange County end up with the same taste in music.  Belle was a driven over-achiever; I, myself, was your typical stoned slacker.  (Yes, now I would&#39;ve hated myself as much as you probably think you would.)  I don&#39;t see our class origins or aspirations as coterminous, and yet here we are.  I would say that this doesn&#39;t even rise to the level of anecdotal, except it seems more true the more people I meet.  </p>

<p>Gay men from the midwest?  Check.  Canadian men from, um, Canada?  Check.  Child of hippies from Berkeley?  Check.  African-American male from Virginia?  Check.  I could go on and on, but I think Belle&#39;s right to point to some sort of relation of certain kinds of minds to certain kinds of forms and/or contents.  I think that explanation makes more sense, covers more bases, than the class angle.  I could see how this seems to fall under the &quot;everybody <i>else&#39;s</i> determinism,&quot; and I&#39;ll grant you that that&#39;s precisely what I&#39;m doing.  I don&#39;t mean to, but I can&#39;t help myself.</p>

<p>Anthony, I was going to respond, you&#39;re not <i>that</i> younger than me, but if you use IM, I suppose you are.  Talk about technology I hate: the ability of anyone to talk to me whenever they want for however long they want.  (<i>shudders</i>)  Some technology the world&#39;s just better off without.  Cell phones, too.  This notion that one should always be reachable, and that excuses must be made if one isn&#39;t . . . I can&#39;t stand it.  In the future there will be no privacy, and people will be praised for the grace and sincerity of their acts of public masturbation.  (Sorry, sorry, I couldn&#39;t help it.  That book still creeps me out.)</p>

<p>Sharon, I know a few people who have reacted violently to Morrissey, but you&#39;re the first who&#39;s called his posturing &quot;masculine.&quot;  Unless you have a very, very different ideal of masculinity across the pond.  (Or maybe it was masculine in context?  I came into my taste around &#39;92 or &#39;93, so the pose seemed stringently androgynous by then.)</p>

<p>Laura, corrected!  I&#39;ve been punting the title to that one for 15 years now, so it&#39;s only fitting I continue the tradition of confusing the lyrics with the title when I move online.</p>

<p>Ben (again), the internet may have something to do with it.  I wonder if it&#39;d be possible to poll our advisors and see if the correspondence here identified (or strongly posited) holds for previous generations of scholars.  Or we all just cooler?</p></span>

A friend and I waited in a long line. It snaked from the entrance to Royce Hall around one building and half of another. When it finally crept forward we were greeted by a large security guard who could have been an extra in a film about a corrupt Los Angeles police force. Or New York. I made a list of things I would observe. I would observe: the capacity of Royce Hall. I would observe: the characteristics of the audience. I would observe: Didion's hands as she spoke about the death of her husband. In two minutes Didion would take the stage. Almost all of the 1,834 seats had been filled but people still shuffled in. Royce Hall had been modeled after the San Ambrogio Church in Milan. Construction on San Ambrogio began in the 4th century. A south tower was added in the 9th. A north in the 12th. The 12th century oversaw a interior remodeling in the popular Romanesque style. The rolling terrain of the young UCLA campus suggested northern Italy to the architects. Three years later they had completed their Romanesque basilica. Of the Westwood campus' original four buildings it is the only one which stands unrenovated. In the 15th Century Cardinal Ascanio Sforza ordered Bramante to add cloisters to the church. Sforza belonged to the ruling family of Milan. Its founder is rumored to have bent metal bars with his hands. Ascanio wanted to create what the 19th century American philosopher Josiah Royce would call &quot;a community of hope.&quot; The community would be &quot;constituted by the fact that each of its members accepts, as part of his own individual life and self, the same expected future events that each of his fellows accepts.&quot; The UCLA Fellows agreed with Royce and named a building after him. The building was filled to near capacity. In the audience were many older Californians, fans of her work in the '60s and '70s and naturally sympathetic to the lose of a spouse or a child. They too would have lost someone, or soon will. There were also many younger women finding seats, asking men who had rolled joints in Berkeley in the '60s if they could squeeze by. Her long blonde hair brushed his arm as she passed and you knew from his face he didn't mind. He could imagine her in an iconic yellow bikini as the Vietnam War raged. He could remember when he read in 1979 that Didion was not &quot;the society in microcosm [but] a thirty-four-year-old woman with long straight hair and an old-fashioned bikini bathing suit and bad nerves sitting on an island in the middle of the Pacific waiting for a tidal wave that will not come.&quot; You could almost see him sniff the air in her wake. That these young woman came to hear Didion speak initially surprised many. When Didion took to the stage she related how...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/historians_star.html"><span><strong>Historians, Start Your Engines...</strong> The same day I get tagged by the History Carnival for my post on &quot;Useable Pasts&quot; sees my friend, the UPS man, arrive at my door to deliver Richard Hofstadter: An Intellectual Biography. How fortuitous. David Brown's book demonstrates one problem with the field of intellectual history: Intellectual historians often take the thinkers they write about at their word. I know you know the dead horse I wallop here.* For those who don't, a refresher course. The chapter on Social Darwinism and American Thought opens promisingly enough. &quot;The New Deal changed everything,&quot; Brown writes. And it did. The influence of the New Deal and the reaction of those who, like Hofstadter, stood to Roosevelt's left cannot be quashed from any responsible intellectual history of the period. The New Deal shaped the dissertating Hofstadter's politics to a great extent, so much so that the former Communist critic of the New Deal created a mythic philosophical movement with which the New Dealers could pound their opponents. But from that point forward the quality of the chapter declines steeply. Example #1: But Hofstadter produced his thesis under the eye of Merle Curti, a pioneer in the emerging field of intellectual history. Liberated from the Progressive penchant for appointing heroes and villains, Hofstadter was able to merge both his politics and scholarship into a powerful critique of the great titans. (29) What? You want to know how Hofstadter &quot;liberated himself from Progressive penchant for appointing heroes and villains,&quot; don't you? So do I. I've read few books as many times as I've read Social Darwinism and that statement so disconforms from my knowledge of the book that I'm barely able to type the following summary of Hofstadter's &quot;Table of Contents&quot;: &quot;The Coming of Darwinism&quot;: Summary of the period. &quot;The Vogue of Spencer&quot;: Spencer is a big fat villain. &quot;William Graham Sumner: Social Darwinist&quot;: So is Sumner. &quot;Lester Ward: Critic&quot;: My Hero! &quot;Evolution, Ethics, and Society&quot;: Huxley dreamy, Kidd nightmarish. &quot;The Dissenters&quot;: My Heroes! &quot;The Current of Pragmatism&quot;: Williams James and John Dewey! Give me a &quot;P&quot;! Give me an &quot;R&quot;! Give me . . . I could continue, but I think I've made my point. Hofstadter went to great lengths to create heroes and villains in his turn-of-the-century yarn. On some level, even Brown knows this: Hofstadter found a foil to Sumner's philosophy in the impressive scholarship of Lester Ward. (32) How, I wonder, does one have a foil without antipodes? And if Sumner plays foil to &quot;the impressive&quot; Lester Ward, how does that antipodal logic not cast Sumner as the villain and Ward as the hero? I'm baffled. I could continue all night, but I want to save some material for tomorrow. I'm only three pages into the chapter on Social Darwinism, but I should stop now, as I'm tempted to say, pace Ms. Parker, that this book should not be tossed lightly aside but hurled with great force. *Those with access to the OED can witness the fine pun I stumbled into...</span></a></div>
