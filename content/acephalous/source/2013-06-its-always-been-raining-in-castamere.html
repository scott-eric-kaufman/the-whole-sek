If you haven’t read the books or watched the ninth episode of the third season, I highly recommend you stop reading this right now. As you remember, MacClaren’s means of shooting Tyrion’s wedding in “Second Sons” was one part (hers) misdirection and one part (the character’s) indiscretion. Everyone was a spectacle-in-waiting or a secret-about-to-be-told, but no one was talking to one another. Even the actual attempts at communication — Tywin’s conversation with Tyrion and Joffrey’s failed attempt to hold the floor — weren’t communicative, to the extent that when Tyrion finally revealed what his (modified) intentions were, there was, as I noted in the first post, “a real potential for chaos.” The lesson of the episode is, in short, that when no one’s communicating honestly, honest communication becomes impossible. Everything becomes a performance and the most convincing performer — in this case Tyrion — wins the wedding. All of which is only to say that Tyrion’s wedding consisted of jealously guarded secrets and innuendos, as opposed to the Tully-Frey wedding, in which everyone is open about everything. Beginning with the attractiveness of the woman who isn’t the bride: In a sense, this is a classic medium long shot of the “plain américain“ variety, in that it mimics the Western’s imperative to have everyone visible from the tops of their hats to the tips of their guns — except in this case the gun is Robb Stark’s sword.

They’ve shown their opponents what they’re packing and now a firm assessment of relative armament can be made by characters and viewers alike.

It’s significant that in an episode that will — as I’ll argue — be characterized by requited gazes and general openness, the lighting in this scene indicates that the Starks have something to hide. The white light coming in from frame-right leaves the right sides of their faces in shadow and almost makes it seem as if they’re planning something nefarious, which is ironic both for the obvious reason and because, at this particular moment, Robb’s being chastised by Walder Frey for bringing Talisa to what should have been his wedding: Frey’s half-lit face is also suspect, only more so, because Nutter frames it in a medium close-up.

content-wise, <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/06/www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/06/the-rains-of-castamere-an-lgm-game-of-thrones-podcast-with-steven-attewell-and-sek">in the podcast</a>.

 but no one was talking to one another. Even the actual attempts at 
communication — Tywin’s conversation with Tyrion and Joffrey’s failed

wins the wedding. All of which is only to say that Tyrion’s wedding 
consisted of jealously guarded secrets and innuendos, as opposed to the 
Tully-Frey wedding, in which everyone is open about everything.</p>
<p>Beginning with the attractiveness of the woman who isn’t the bride:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00014.png"><img alt="" height="281" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00014.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="red wedding00014" width="501" /></a></p>
<p>In a sense, this is a classic <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48043">medium long shot of the “<em>plain américain</em>“</a>
 variety, in that it mimics the Western’s imperative to have everyone 
visible from the tops of their hats to the tips of their guns — except 
in this case the gun is Robb Stark’s sword. Point being that this is 
traditionally an “honest” shot used by directors to indicate that the 
characters have nothing to hide. They’ve shown their opponents what 
they’re packing and now a firm assessment of relative armament can be made 
by characters and viewers alike. In this case, it demonstrates how 
anemic the Stark complement within the banquet hall seems. In the light 
that’s filtering down from off-screen right, only Robb’s sword seems 
visible. It’s significant that in an episode that will — as I’ll argue —
 be characterized by requited gazes and general openness, the lighting 
in this scene indicates that the Starks have something to hide. The 
white light coming in from frame-right leaves the right sides of their 
faces in shadow and <em>almost</em> makes it seem as if they’re planning
 something nefarious, which is ironic both for the obvious reason and 
because, at this particular moment, Robb’s being chastised by Walder 
Frey for bringing Talisa to what should have been his wedding:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00013.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00013.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="red wedding00013" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Frey’s half-lit face is also suspect, only more so, because Nutter 
frames it in a medium close-up. When a group of six people are all 
“victims” of the same strong off-screen light source, the general effect
 is that there’s a large off-camera lamp or window. It&#39;s innocuous. (That’s why “almost” 
is in italics up there.) The only way to make them actually seem 
nefarious would be to exaggerate the effect like so:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00014a.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00014a.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="red wedding00014a" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Had Nutter shot the Stark clan with such extreme contrast, they’d 
look genuinely secretive and dangerous. But he didn’t. And the fact that
 in this scene they’ve bucked common sense and not only allowed Talisa 
to accompany them, but that they’re allowing Walder Frey to inspect her,
 means that the single off-screen light source is naturalistic in these 
medium long shots. But it’s absolutely expressionistic when the camera 
reverses to Frey:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00015.png"><img alt="" height="281" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00015.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="red wedding00015" width="501" /></a></p>
<p>Even though Nutter pulls back into a medium shot, the fact that 
Frey’s the only person in frame and that shadows cover half his face 
make him look like a man of dubious motives. It’s a basic yet effective 
principle that one-shots, like the ones of Frey above, tend to be read 
as psychologically indicative of <em>something</em> in a way that 
similarly lit shots of groups don’t. Of the many reasons for this are 
that our brains consider gangs of people inherently menacing, whereas 
when we encounter a single person, his or her motivations are a matter 
of specific divination. A different part of the brain’s engaged when 
we’re trying to evaluate the danger potentially written on an<em> individual</em>
 face, so these one-shots of Walder Frey invite us to consider him as a 
singular agent and the shadows falling over half his face make it seem 
like he’s hiding something. Because he is: <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/09/game-of-thrones-winter-is-coming-for-will-and-bran.html#1">he’s hiding his face</a>.<a name="1"></a>
 Even if you haven’t read the novels, the way in which Frey’s shot as he
 discusses the “pertness” of pregnant Talisa’s breasts should alert you 
that the conversation isn’t the only thing that’s inappropriate here.</p>
<p>So too should your memory of Tyrion’s wedding. Remember that McClaren’s first shots of it were <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/05/i-see-that-youve-seen-that-i-saw-you-miscommunication-in-second-sons-game-of-thrones">deliberately confusing</a>:
 the audience wasn’t allowed to see who sat where or in relation to 
whom. But at the Tully-Frey wedding, Nutter canvasses the room via the 
plate of bread and salt intended to secure the Stark’s safety:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00002.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00002.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="red wedding00002" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>As that plate moves about the room in <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#98486">a fairly long take</a>,
 we’re able to see the relative locations of all the major players. We 
know where everyone is and that they’re relating to each other in a 
conventional “medieval” hierarchy: the Lord takes the high seat even in 
the presence of the King of the North. That should tell us something too
 — that Frey’s requiring his nominal King to act the part of supplicant,
 which is understandable given these particular circumstances but 
contradicts conventions set up elsewhere, as in “Winter Is Coming”:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00307.png"><img alt="" height="281" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00307.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="red wedding00307" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The Queen sits <em>beside</em> the Lady of House Stark, she doesn’t stand <em>before </em>her, as Frey demands of Robb. Speaking of whom, and because <a href="http://youtu.be/zlxH9-TYseY">I am trying to break your heart</a>, here’s a random image from “Winter Is Coming”:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00308.png"><img alt="" height="281" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00308.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="red wedding00308" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>What can we say in the presence of the child who be King? Only that 
his position relative to his mother and Queen Cersei is as appropriate 
here as it is inappropriate in “The Rains of Castamere.” That Robb isn’t
 this Robb and shouldn’t be treated as such, or at the very least should
 be suspicious when he is. Frey’s trying to infantilize the King of the 
North, and because he believes he’s wronged Frey, Robb offers this small
 social humiliation as a kind of physical apology. So as things stand 
the audience should be acknowledging Robb and company’s attempted 
humility before a literally shady Walder Frey, and because of the broken
 bread that’s traversed the room, should not only be secure in the 
Stark’s safety but also aware of the slightly inappropriate location of 
the significant characters relative to each other. The ostensible 
openness of this wedding is a direct invocation and inversion of 
Tyrion’s, but as we well know, the bile undermining this visual candor 
will bubble up soon enough. Just not before Nutter reminds us that 
everything is fine:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00046.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00046.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="red wedding00046" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This shot’s representative of how the banquet’s framed. Instead of families <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00076.png">staring each</a> <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00221.png">other down</a>
 off-frame from opposite ends of the hall, Nutter captures all the 
celebrants in establishing shots like this, which for the purpose of 
this episode work like a cheap magician’s sleeves: you can’t see what 
you know’s up them. The shadows falling on Frey’s face and his defiance 
of decorum should’ve alerted you to his base intent, but Nutter’s 
framing of the banquet reassures you that man who pointed over there and
 yelled “<a href="http://youtu.be/xrAIGLkSMls">Squirrel</a>!” isn’t 
engaged in misdirection. I won’t subject you to another episode of Game 
of Lasers, but I assure you that everyone’s making eye contact with the 
appropriate people. Frey threw Robb one knowing glance when the beauty 
of the bride was revealed, but other than that, when people are talking 
to each other, they’re talking to each other:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00065.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00065.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="red wedding00065" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Everything must be fine because everyone’s behaving like humans 
engaged in natural conversations. Be it the three-shot of Catelyn 
talking to Bolton or the four-shot of Robb and Talisa talking about 
Catelyn talking to Bolton, everyone at this wedding is making 
appropriate eye contact.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00041.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00041.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="red wedding00041" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Did I say “everyone”? I meant <em>almost </em>everyone. Remember what
 I said earlier about our human disinclination to trust gangs of people?
 The Starks fought that instinct by turning toward Frey and offering him
 their full faces. He could make eye contact with any of them as per his desire.
 This lot with the musical instruments? They’re not making eye contact 
with anybody — not even each other. And they’re being shot from an 
empowering <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48004">low angle</a>.
 And they’re focusing on their instruments with the deadly intent of 
incompetent amateurs. All of which are indications that something’s 
afoot at this otherwise open-seeming wedding banquet. The tension builds
 between Nutter’s direction and what half the audience knows is coming, 
but it should also disquiet the half that doesn’t. Because Nutter’s not even a cheap magician. He&#39;s the 
replacement magician your father hired when the first one showed up 
stoned: he’s trying to disguise the birds in his lapels by pulling coins
 from your ears <em>but he isn’t fooling anyone</em>.</p>
<p>You what’s coming.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t.</p>
<p>Because this is what foreboding feels like. This is the look on your 
lover’s face the moment before she reveals she’s betrayed you. This is 
crack in your father’s voice the moment before you learn your mother’s 
died. This is that moment and it is terrible:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00146.png"><img alt="" height="279" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/red-wedding00146.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="red wedding00146" width="498" /></a></p>
<p>Catelyn sees those doors shut and realizes she’s in such a moment. She’s quickly coming to terms with what that means — like <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/06/youtu.be/U5tJKzj6k_Q#t=03m15s">Diane Keaton at the end of <em>The Godfather</em></a>, only Catelyn knows that she’s not being <em>barred from</em> so much as <em>locked in</em> with the monsters.</p>

So here's Steven Attewell and I discussing &quot;The Rains of Castamere.&quot; Enjoy? You can listen to the above podcast here. Our very civilized discussion of the premiere (S03E01). Fancy-talking about “Dark Wings, Dark Words” (S03E02). Here we are blathering on about “Walk of Punishment” (S03E03). Don’t watch — because you can’t — us discuss “And Now His Watch Has Ended” (S03E04). The rudely interrupted first half of our discussion of “Kissed by Fire” (S03E05). The second half of our discussion of religion in “Kissed by Fire” (S03E05). In which we discuss “The Climb” sans spoilers (S03E06). “The Climb” with spoilers (S03E06). “Second Sons.” We has them (S03E08). Belatedly, &quot;The Bear and the Maiden Fair&quot; (S03E07).</span></a></div>

At 37:38 in the podcast, Steven and I argued about when the band began to play the song “The Rains of Castamere,” which is associated with House Lannister, and though this may seem like an insignificant detail, I don’t think it is. So I don’t want anyone to think that I’m arguing just to argue here, because this is one of the most important moments in traditional tragedy. In the Poetics, Aristotle claims that simple plots merely contain a catastrophe — something terrible happens for which general pity is felt — but complex plots combine that tragedy with anagnorisis, or a moment of recognition. This moment of recognition is not had by the audience, but by a character within the play; that is, it’s had by a character with whom the audience sympathizes, and through whose perspective the consequences of this catastrophe can be understood. In other words, for Aristotle, the superior play is one in which the audience’s sympathies are focalized through a perspective in a way that personalizes the catastrophe. It’s not just generally sad that these Trojans have to die, it’s particularly sad that we’re forced to watch one of them we care about realize he’s about to die. That’s the heart of traditional tragedy: it’s not the catastrophe itself (because the audience isn’t in actual jeopardy), but the sympathetic identification with the character who realizes he’s about to be killed (because that’s something the audience can actually feel) that makes a tragedy effective. In other word: this moment is important because it’s the engine of tragedy. The audience may only realize what’s happening when “The Rains of Castamere” begins to play, but because tragedy’s supposed to lead to reflection, it’s important to determine exactly when Catelyn does. So here we go. Robb and Talisa are having a long and playful conversation that ends in her informing him that she’s carrying a child named “Eddard Stark.” I’ve animated the 33-second-long conversation so you can see that it consists of 15 reversals and one pan down: There are a number of things to note about this sequence, including that these are shallow focus two-shots, meaning that the only two characters in focus are Robb and Talisa and that they share the frame in each of the fifteen reversals. Sharing the frame in a two-shot cements in the audience’s mind the connection between particular characters. This works when they’re strangers — but even more so when they’re already a married pregnant couple and bellies are being touched. The number of reversals means the length of each shot is a little over two seconds, which is on par with Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol (sandstorm chase), G.I. Joe: Retaliation (opening sequence), and Casino Royale (first 12 minutes not including precredits), i.e. action sequences in films with already very short shot lengths. If there’s a reason their exchange feels oddly rushed, it’s because it’s being filmed...</span></a></div>
