<ul><li><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0399295/"><em>Lord of War</em></a>, penned and directed by the both over- (<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0258153/"><em>S1m0ne</em></a>)&nbsp; and under- rated (<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0119177/"><em>Gattaca</em></a>) New Zealand-born Andrew Niccol</li>

<li><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0405422/"><em>The 40 Year Old Virgin</em></a>, by Judd Apatow, the man responsible for the sublime (but short-lived) <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0193676/"><em>Freaks and Geeks</em></a></li>

<li><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0387131/"><em>The Constant Gardener</em></a>, Fernando Meirelles' follow-up to his brilliant <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0576987/"><em>City of God</em></a></li>

<li><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0399146/"><em>A History of Violence</em></a>, the latest by David Cronenberg</li>

<li><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0380599/"><em>Oliver Twist</em></a>, the latest by Roman Polanski</li>

<p>All these films share one common element: they exist only because their directors have clout enough to flip the finger at the contemporary Hollywood system.&nbsp; The steady decline in box office tallies has created a class of directors who, while producing nothing so sublime as Copolla's <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0071360/"><em>The Conversation</em></a>, will produce the most impressive August and September in recent memory.&nbsp; Their films may suffer beside qualitative heights of the auteur era, but the quantitative breadth of quality films they've pushed into American theaters is an equally impressive feat.&nbsp; For the first time in ages the question isn't &quot;Which one will insult my intelligence the least?&quot; but &quot;Which one do I want to see most?&quot;&nbsp; I haven't had the opportunity to ask that question in quite some time.&nbsp; And did I mention television?&nbsp; </p>

<li>Fox has forgotten to cancel <em><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0367279/">Arrested Development</a></em> for the third straight season.</li>

<li>Shaun Cassidy returns to television (ten years after the cancellation of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0111880/"><em>American Gothic</em></a>) with the intelligent and disturbingly timely <em><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0460651/">Invasion</a>.</em></li>

<li>Ricky Gervais' <em><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0445114/">Extras</a> </em>is set to debut on HBO (as are the fifth season of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0264235/"><em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em></a> and the third season of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0348914/"><em>Deadwood</em></a>).</li>

		<span id="comment-92512130-content"><p>I realize this is somewhat belated commentary, but since I&#39;m not commenting on the contemporary stuff it doesn&#39;t seem to matter. I&#39;m just glad to see someone else who appreciates <i>The Conversation</i> - after stumbling on it accidentally on AMC one afternoon, I was so taken aback I looked it up online and was surprised to find mixed reviews. Also, that it apparently lost to <i>Godfather 2</i> for Best Picture that year. (In the interests of disclosure, no, I haven&#39;t actually seen G2 - or any of the Godfather movies for that matter.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-92573748-content"><p>If you liked <em>The Conversation</em>, Tony, you should check up on <em>The Godfather</em> -- the first two parts at least.  As for it winning out over <em>The Conversation</em>, Coppola was competing against himself, and the thought was that they were rewarding him for both films.  (Again, can you imagine someone producing not one, but TWO films of such quality in the same year anymore?  The closest we&#39;ll come is <em>Knocked Up</em> and <em>Superbad</em>, but that ain&#39;t quite the same.)</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/differences_wit.html"><span><strong>Differences without Distinctions: Another Post (sort of) about the Weather</strong> As Summer yields to the inconstant stress of Fall, I want to take a moment to reflect on what I've accomplished and press the muzzle of what I haven't firmly to my temple. Or maybe I should inhale deeply ... and again ... and again. Now I feel better. Crazed but better. I remind myself that the danger of a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 155 miles per hour differs only terminologically from the danger of a Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 160 miles per hours. As I begin to hyperventilate I remember that Rita is only history's third strongest hurricane and then I realize that I'm still blogging about the weather. Of all the things I never thought I'd launch into online permanence, the cliché which launched a thousand pointless conversations topped the list. Yet observe the depths to which I have so eagerly rappeled.[1] And so I offer Nature the following compromise: I will stop writing about the weather if you promise to stop churning out weather worth writing about. Deal? [1] While double-checking that I spelled &quot;rappel&quot; correctly I inadvertantly came across the entry for &quot;rapely,&quot; which means &quot;hastily, in haste, quickly.&quot; The chilling irony of the definition certainly offends, but not nearly so much as the selected quotation: &quot;Adam took Gamelyn, And ladde him rapely and anon.&quot; (Even when a footnote flees from hurricane Katrina and her horrible sister I still roll some disturbing die.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/a_friday_twilig.html"><span><strong>Friday's Twilight Confessional</strong> I confess that the Ninth Ward once terrified me and that my friends who lived there knew it did. I confess to concocting excuses to meet them somewhere other than the Ninth Ward. I confess that last night I had countless nightmares about my parents or friends being caught in their cars on the Interstate 10 as they fled from Rita. I confess that the sleeplessness these nightmares caused had a deleterious effect on my ability to welcome and introduce my students to Literary Journalism 20. (I also confess that a massive overcompensation effort is already underway.) I confess that whenever I think &quot;the situation cannot deteriorate further&quot; it invariably does and that I feel an irrational irresponsibility for it. I confess that I am even more tired of thinking and talking and writing about hurricanes today than I have ever been tired of thinking and talking and writing about anything that is not my dissertation. I confess that this thinking and talking and writing about hurricanes has lowered the odds of my finishing the Jack London chapter by Monday to a pathetic 23 percent. I confess that this confession began as a comment on Kotsko's &quot;Friday Afternoon Confessional&quot; and that despite my atheism I have found confessing cathartic. (I also confess that I did not know that outside of Aristotelian literary theory &quot;cathartic&quot; refers to &quot;the evacuation of the bowels.&quot; I confess I find the metaphorical leap disturbing.) I confess that I have searched the archives of Adam's Weblog so that I might learn more about his faith because faith confuses me. I confess that while I wish I could experience faith I am more frequently of the opinion of 19th Century philosopher and arch-evolutionist Ernst Haeckel, who in The Riddle of the Universe (1899) said that modern theology &quot;adores a personal God as an invisible—properly speaking, gaseous—being, yet makes him think, speak and act in human fashion [and] gives us the paradoxial picture of a 'gaseous vertebrate.'&quot; (I confess that my monism and materialism often depress me ... but that the alternatives depress me even more.) I confess I want to end this confession with a bang but must settle for a whimper ... because I confess the delirium with which I taught this morning is nothing next to how nebulous my thoughts are now. Finally, I confess that said bang concerned what I need in my nécessaire and why I find this portrait of a &quot;confessant&quot; compelling.</span></a></div>
