<p>
In “The End of the Poststructuralist Era,” from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1593761015/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Follies of the Wise</em></a>,
Frederick Crews charts the hasty marriage and slow estrangement of
poststructuralist thought and New Left activism.&nbsp; His argument, and its
implications, may surprise you.
</p>
<p>You see, the Yale School of deconstruction’s “manifest aim was ...
to bring a spirit of erudite whimsy into the discussion of familiar
[canonical] books, which would be rendered only more endearing by the
discovery that their meanings were more multitudinous and undecidable
than anyone had yet surmised” (308).&nbsp; Too true, too true.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Only, why would the discovery of even “more multitudinous and
undecidable” dimensions to canonical literature open up the canon to
previously marginalized voices?&nbsp; Wouldn’t deconstruction have <em>the opposite</em> effect?&nbsp; Hillis, speaking here in his 1986 presidential address, certainly thought so:
</p>
<blockquote><p>As everyone knows, literary study in the past few years
has undergone a sudden, almost universal turn away from theory in the
ordinary sense of an orientation toward language as such and has made a
corresponding turn toward history, culture, society, politics,
institutions, class and gender conditions. (283)</p></blockquote>
<p>
Color me confused.&nbsp; Here I thought theory necessarily entailed the
commitments it so recently acquired.&nbsp; Here I thought older modes of
criticism possessed the retrograde politics.&nbsp; Here I thought a lot of
things a little historical perspective shattered.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because the
explanations were conceptual.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Because they’re <em>always</em> conceptual.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Poststructuralist thought <em>always</em> allies itself with a progressive politics, and poststructuralist thinkers <em>always</em>
fold the latter into the former.&nbsp; The result?&nbsp; Opposition to
poststructuralist thought necessarily entails an opposition to the
progressiveness of its immanent politics.&nbsp; Now I can complain that
those politics aren’t immanent, that no textual orientation contains an
immanent politics, but I will be shouted down by those who experience <em>as natural</em>
their political and theoretical commitments, who cannot disentangle
them because, well, because no one can offer a convincing reason that
they should.
</p>
<p>For the better part of two decades, literary critics have used a
poststructuralist theoretical approach to generate a body of
progressive thought, so <em>of course</em>
the two appear inseparable.&nbsp; Factor in the overwhelming number of
conservative critics who fancy themselves poststructuralists, then
think about it:
</p>
<p>If everyone who does what they do shares the same politics, and
everyone who doesn’t, doesn’t, why would they question a connection
that feels so natural to them?&nbsp; They have no reason to.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
So they haven’t.&nbsp; I have, but from the wrong direction.&nbsp; I started in
the ‘70s moving forward, from the moment when the former radicals
gained purchase in the discipline.&nbsp; All this time, I should have been
looking at it from the other direction, from the ‘80s moving
backwards.&nbsp; To point out, as Hillis does above, that “theory in the
ordinary sense” existed independently of the commitments it eventually
acquired.
</p>
<p>
Conceptual arguments <em>be damned</em>, I say, I have <em>history</em>.&nbsp; The two are <em>not</em> one, not naturally.&nbsp; They may be one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium_%28Plato%29#Aristophanes">this lot</a>, but more than likely not.&nbsp; Just a simple couple whose marriage, while productive, is neither permanent nor necessary.

		<span id="comment-19719758-content"><p>I&#39;m going to have to read that book. The idea that any body of thought at all secures its own radicality is a dumb, and sometimes dangerous, error. I went to a conference once, held by the Radical Philosophy Association. It was a good time. Lots of other commies who really like books, and many similar books. But it&#39;s really easy to deceive oneself, as if &quot;I have far left beliefs&quot; means &quot;what I do is of or for or a contribution to the far left&quot;. The conference would have been better called &quot;Radicals Who Make Excessive Detours Through Philosophy&quot;, that would have been more honest and could have helpd some folk accomplish the working through they were engaged in. So yeah, post-structural lit crit as radical? And to be blunt, campus politics in general? I mean ... really, come on. Not to say it&#39;s without value, but the pose of being really far left, on the side of the angels and all that. A bit self-serving, you know?<br />

I estimated that the bulk of my 700 daily hits were random folks stumbling here from Google. Now that Google refuses to index Acephalous—for reasons they refuse to share with the likes of lowly me—I have a much more accurate estimate of my audience. To be frank, I'm floored. One of you (who requested anonymity) told me to check the number of people who subscribe to my feed—that is, the number of you who read below my radar. So I did. I'm overwhelmed. I mean it. Overwhelmed. I thought I'd get a couple of takers on last night's offer. Estimated fifteen, maybe twenty, people who'd be interested. And my TypePad account can handle a couple of people downloading a fourth of a gig each . . . . . . but it can't handle 153 (one-hundred and fifty-three!) requests.* I've sent as many of you as I currently can the gift I promised. I'm thinking of trying to send the rest via my Gmail account, but that'll only fly if I'm sending it to other Gmail accounts. So if you responded to last night's post but haven't heard back from me yet, please send me a Gmail address or one I can send a Gmail invite to. Because I feel terrible, not living up to my promise. But seriously, I'm also incredibly flattered. I didn't realize there were that many of you out there. I thought my ego inflated by a Googillusion. Turns out I was wrong. Which—the burdensome guilt notwithstanding—makes this whole enterprise feel commensurate to my (continued) investment in it. * That's actually a reference to Joyce. When he moved to Paris, he sent his family letters in which he emphasized his suffering by means of clever repetition. For example, a letter to his dying mother in which he writes &quot;Your order for 3s 4d of Tuesday last was very welcome as I had been without food for 42 hours (forty-two).&quot; I may've added some italics and an exclamation point, but that's only because 21st centurions are innoculated against the emphasis of simple, powerful repetition.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/on_not_taking_t.html"><span><strong>On Not Taking the Long-Cut</strong> We all take shortcuts. We all have a couple of scholars in our pockets who, in a pinch, we feel comfortable reading what they've written about Thinker X instead of tackling Thinker X herself. Admit it. You and I both know where you learned about Ernst Bloch. There's no shame in it. (Anyway, in Scholar Heaven everyone gets to read all the books they always meant to get around to reading, so why not cut few terrestrial corners?) I say this partly in response to forgottenboy and Adam's comments in defense of Freud on the basis of established utility. As a means to local argumentative ends, i.e. stripped of its universal explanatory power, I could live with the continued presence of psychoanalytic thought in literary studies. I know—and am presently arguing with—people for whom this better-than-squat model enables them to produce incisive work. But I still question its independence. As Ken Rufo recently wrote: The splits that we see at work between so-called modernists and postmodernists, between Lacanians and Deleuzians, between all manner of methodological beasts, are in large part not splits caused by differences in reading for meaning, but rather differences in the methods by which interpretation and the subsequent production of meaning is possible. In other words, the theoretical assumptions that inform the interpretation determine the possibilities and final form that any interpretation will take. That final sentence speaks directly to my concern that even a local psychoanalytic explanation has global effects on the shape and outcome of the argument it assists. The argument may have turned another way—perhaps an equally tendentious one, but differently so—had it not adopted a set of ready-made psychoanalytic concerns. A Jamesian reading may have worked better, but the psychoanalytic has greater appeal. Why? Cultural capital, for one. Tradition, for another. Equally powerful—and equally obvious—is its status as a system of ideas with a built-in fail-safe, what Ernest Gellner calls &quot;a self-maintaining circle of ideas [conveniently] well-equipped with devices for evading falsification.&quot; If we're going to take a short-cut, why not take the well-respected, traditional one we can expertly defend? To put it differently: We all turn conservative when we have our hand in the cookie jar. It seems natural to stuff our guilty consciences behind the most heavily fortified position available, and psychoanalysis is it. I understand the motivation, but fear it over-applied. (In some cases, &quot;only-applied.&quot;) I'm not knocking strong ideological and philosophical convictions per se. I am, however, questioning the seriousness with which they're held when folks betray little or no awareness of the trap 1) integral to their theoretical druthers which they 2) spring with postal regularity. Why not admit it? Why insist that one is open to new ideas when the very system to which one so rigidly subscribes precludes the possibility of accepting them? If everyone else knows you play a rigged game, shouldn't you?</span></a></div>
