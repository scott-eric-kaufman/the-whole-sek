The difference, obviously, is not in the media's furtherance of a narrative, but in the non-incidental relation of particular ideologies with acts of violence.

Unlike his acolyte Althouse, whose affected contrarianism runs so vast and deep she'll write anything if she thinks one rube will do a double-take reading it, Reynolds plays politics to win. He wants to own the narrative, and because his platform trickles up into all the right places, he mostly has a legitimate claim to it. In this case, he hikes over to RateMyProfessor.com—a site that allows angry students to vent anonymously after they receive grades they deserve—and finds a comment in which an undergraduate calls her a &quot;socialist&quot; and before you know it, all the usual suspects are employing &quot;socialist&quot; as an anarthrous occupational nominal premodifier, e.g. &quot;socialist Alabama professor,&quot; &quot;socialist serial killer,&quot; etc. On the strength, then, of a single comment by an upset undergraduate, conservative hacks are folding socialism into what they imagine her profession to be—be it a professor or a serial killer—in an attempt to create the impression of equivalence between ideology and act where none actually exists.

			The Other Scott already <a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2010/02/hack-of-day.html">noted</a> Glenn Reynolds&#39;s tendentious <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/93802/">link</a> and Steven Taylor&#39;s pithy <a href="http://www.poliblogger.com/?p=17753">rebuttal</a>
of its underlying &quot;logic,&quot; but I wanted to focus on the quotation from
Reynolds&#39;s reader in the update, because it points to a fundamental
disconnect between the rhetoric of the right and the left:<br /><blockquote>I&#39;m
guessing the &quot;she&#39;s a socialist&quot; part won&#39;t get talked about much in
the MSM. But if she had been a conservative it&#39;d lead every evening
news cast for two months.</blockquote>The crucial difference between
this mass-shooting and other recent ones is that, for example, Nidal
Hasan didn&#39;t consider himself a liberal, nor did he devote himself to
liberal causes—he was, it seems, someone with pretensions to Islamic
jihad. Scott Roeder, however, shot George Tiller in the service of a <em>mainstream conservative cause</em>.
The difference, obviously, is not in the media&#39;s furtherance of a
narrative, but in the non-incidental relation of particular ideologies
with acts of violence.<br /><br />Conservatives complain 1) when liberals
ask that any brown person with a funny name not be labeled a jihadist
until evidence of such is unearthed, and 2) when mainstream news
outlets link the murder of prominent abortion doctors to conservative
causes. They fail to see the lack of equivalence: liberals don&#39;t
espouse jihad against the United States, but conservatives do inspire
those on their fringes to engage in <em>politically motivated violence</em>.
The politics of the George Tiller murder are an indictment against
conservative rhetoric because that rhetoric made Tiller a target;
whereas the personal politics of Amy Bishop are utterly irrelevant in
the absence of a vocal and sustained opposition to the existence of the
university and the tenure system among liberals.<br /><br />That
conservatives are working a false equivalence is made evident by
Reynolds&#39;s pathological desire to find evidence that will allow him to
turn this tragedy into mere political gamesmanship. Unlike his acolyte
Althouse, whose affected contrarianism runs so vast and deep she&#39;ll
write anything if she thinks one rube will do a double-take reading it,
Reynolds plays politics to win. He wants to own the narrative, and
because his platform trickles up into all the right places, he mostly
has a legitimate claim to it. In this case, he hikes over to
RateMyProfessor.com—a site that allows angry students to vent
anonymously after they receive grades they deserve—and finds a comment
in which an undergraduate calls her a &quot;<a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=392617&amp;page=1">socialist</a>&quot; and before you know it, <a href="http://gatewaypundit.firstthings.com/2010/02/socialist-alabama-professor-shot-3-colleagues-dead-shot-her-brother-dead-robbed-auto-dealership-with-shotgun-was-linked-to-attempted-harvard-bombing/">all the</a> <a href="http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/socialist-serial-killer-amy-bishop.html">usual suspects</a> are employing &quot;socialist&quot; as an <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/001628.html">anarthrous occupational nominal premodifier</a>, <em>e.g.</em>
&quot;socialist Alabama professor,&quot; &quot;socialist serial killer,&quot; etc. On the
strength, then, of a single comment by an upset undergraduate,
conservative hacks are folding socialism into what they imagine her
profession to be—be it a professor or a serial killer—in an attempt to
create the impression of equivalence between ideology and act where
none actually exists.<br /><br />At least not yet. (The day still being young and all.)

The judge expresses it as: &#39;Who is right, and who is wrong?&#39; The scholar is content to ask: &#39;Why?&#39; and he accepts the fact that the answer may not be simple. Whether as a prejudice of common sense, a postulate of logicians, or a habit of prosecuting attorneys, the monism of cause can be, for history, only an impediment. History seeks for causal wave-trains and is not afraid, since life shows them to be so, to find them multiple. &quot; -- Marc Bloch, The Historian&#39;s Craft, p. 193-194.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef012877af2c67970c-content"><p>What to say in response to this piece of garbage?</p>

<p>Only thing to do is to take it apart piece by piece, I guess, kind of like a garbage picker.</p>

<p>*The crucial difference between this mass-shooting and other recent ones is that, for example, Nidal Hasan didn&#39;t consider himself a liberal, nor did he devote himself to liberal causes—he was, it seems, someone with pretensions to Islamic jihad. Scott Roeder, however, shot George Tiller in the service of a mainstream conservative cause.*</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, the removal of U.S. troops from Iraq and Afg. is not a `mainstream liberal cause&#39;?</p>

<p>It is about as mainstream as you can get; Nidal or whatever, chose to use violent methods to pursue that end.</p>

<p>do mainstream `liberals&#39; (what you Americans call socialists) approve of the actions of the major.  Of course not.  do cons. approve of the actions of Roeder.  No, of course they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>but then, do mainstream cons. call abortionists `murderers&#39; or `genocidalists&#39;?  Please, if you have evidence of this, provide links.  do mainstream liberals accuse American soldiers of war crimes?  I&#39;d ask you to ask John Murtha, but unfortunately he&#39;s dead.</p>

<p>*The difference, obviously, is not in the media&#39;s furtherance of a narrative, but in the non-incidental relation of particular ideologies with acts of violence.*</p>

<p>Which, is this were true, would see that mainstream `liberals&#39; ideologies have more to do with a jihadi violence than does mainstream cons&#39;tism with the act of Scott Roeder.</p>

<p>*Conservatives complain 1) when liberals ask that any brown person with a funny name not be labeled a jihadist until evidence of such is unearthed, and 2) when mainstream news outlets link the murder of prominent abortion doctors to conservative causes.*</p>

<p>Yes, you see that all the time: Conservatives complaining, whining, crying all the time when brown people with funny names are not automatically labelled terrorists!!!!!  It&#39;s a very common complaint... which is why, just after 9/11, Bush the younger turned around and said, `Condileeza?  What a funny name!  You&#39;re obviously brown and a terrorist!&#39;</p>

<p>Oh wait, wasn&#39;t that the proprietor of this web log?</p>

<p>*They fail to see the lack of equivalence: liberals don&#39;t espouse jihad against the United States, but conservatives do inspire those on their fringes to engage in politically motivated violence.*</p>

<p>but again, mainstream `liberals&#39; anti-anti-terrorism rhetoric is obviously more related to the attacks of major Nidal and of the 9.11 terrorists than anything mainstream conservatives have said.</p>

<p>*That conservatives are working a false equivalence is made evident by Reynolds&#39;s pathological desire to find evidence that will allow him to turn this tragedy into mere political gamesmanship. Unlike his acolyte Althouse, whose affected contrarianism runs so vast and deep she&#39;ll write anything if she thinks one rube will do a double-take reading it, Reynolds plays politics to win.*</p>

<p>Oh no!  the Rubes are doing double takes!  run for the hills!</p>

<p>You are right, in one regard, there is no equivalence.</p>

<p>Maintream `liberals&#39; rhetoric and alliances give aid and comfort to fascist jihadis, a very large mass movement, while mainstream conservative give no such aid to anti-abortionist freaks... who are a very marginal no. compared to Islamic fascists. </p>

<p>the rest blah, blah, blah...</p>

I am, in fact, &quot;an ugly little twerp, and [Donald Douglas doesn't] mean that figuratively.&quot; He means that literally: the average height of American males is 5'10&quot;, so people who are 6'1&quot; like me are literally little. We are literally dwarfed by all those people three inches shorter than us. As to the rest, Douglas declares his intention to &quot;eschew substantive comments on [the argument I] posted&quot; in favor of unadulterated ad hominem: I'm a &quot;miniscule academic mountebank&quot; I represent &quot;all that is genuinely wicked and destructive in university culture today&quot; I'm a &quot;hate-pimp&quot; I'm &quot;a merchant of hate of the most despicable kind&quot; I'm a &quot;spindle of a man&quot; I disparage &quot;a true-academic's babe-blogging&quot; I also know how to use a hyphen properly, but that's neither here nor there. Douglas's only defense for the material he posts is that it &quot;doesn't bother [him] a bit&quot; because &quot;it's a free world, you know.&quot; I actually didn't know that, but I do know that I'm not surprised that Douglas read a post about material his students might find unsettling and responded by claiming that it doesn't bothers him.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/02/which-graphic-novels-would-you-teach-in-a-visual-rhetoric-course.html"><span><strong>Which graphic novels would you teach in a visual rhetoric course?</strong> The plan for the visual rhetoric book I'm co-authoring is to have three or four substantial chapters focusing on 1) rhetoric generally, 2) the history of the medium, 3) the mechanics of comics, and 4) the rhetoric of comics, followed by ten chapters devoted to particular novels that instructors compel their students to purchase. The problem, as you can probably guess, is deciding which ten books should we subject to sustained close-reading. We're going to be leaning hard on McCloud's Understanding Comics throughout, but as for the ten other books, the list we've compiled so far includes: Alison Bechdel, Fun Home Kohta Hirano, Hellsing, Vol. 1 David Mazzucchelli, Asterios Polyp Frank Miller, 300 Hayao Miyazaki, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Vol. 1 Alan Moore, Watchmen Marjane Satrapi, Persepolis Gene Luen Yang, American Born Chinese The idea is to provide a wide variety of central texts to teach—as well as a template for doing so—which is why we have American comics, European comics, and manga; autobiographical works and books decked in tights; novels with readily available film adaptations (300, Watchmen, Persepolis) or companions (Miyazaki's Nausicaä and his animated features like Howl's Moving Castle or Spirited Away); etc. In short, our concern is not to represent the best-and-brightest the medium has to offer, but to offer a selection of novels that will be useful to the greatest number of potential teachers. For example, this list lacks an overtly political book like Joe Sacco's Palestine; Gaiman is absent, as the narrative complexity of the Sandman trades would force him to be represented by a minor work like Black Orchid; Batman is nowhere to found, as we already have a Miller and a Moore, so The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight Returns are out, which means the Nolan films have no natural pair; etc. In an ideal world, what other works would you like to see us cover?</span></a></div>
