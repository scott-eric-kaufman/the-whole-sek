Regular blogging will continue as usual. (See?) Now on to &quot;Winter Is Coming.&quot; For those of you who haven't read George R.R. Martin's Games of Thrones, it's important to note that there are twenty-four characters through whose perspective the narrative is occasionally focalized, meaning that the writers and directors of the television series needed to go full-Rashomon or find another way to imbue each episode with the feel of perspectival diversity. Which makes the decision to open &quot;Winter Is Coming&quot; with the Prologue odd but instructive. On the one hand, beginning where the novel begins is a simple decision: Martin placed the Prologue where he did because he wanted to set the mood for the scenes to come and director Tim Van Patten followed suit. On the other hand, in an episode that can only be 52 minutes long and in which numerous perspectives must be introduced, devoting 11 minutes to the quick end of the short life of Will, the Prologue's narrator, seems excessive. I'm going to argue otherwise: what the material contained in the Prologue provides the audience is a means of sympathizing with the different perspectives on Will's life and death, and in so doing begins to recreate the structure of the novel. But I'm getting ahead of myself here. First we need to be introduced to Will: He's one of those little black dots on horseback in this extreme long or establishing shot, the purpose of which is establish the scale of the wall by providing us with an identifiable reference and the state of the environment by showing us an unimaginably large wall made of ice and a cover of snow that follows the wall to the vanishing point. Before we even meet Will, then, Van Patten informs us that he is a small man beholden to powers great enough to build and maintain that wall, and that he is likely in peril, because no one who isn't builds and lives behind a wall like that. Moreover, the contrast between the blue-white snow and the black riders suggests that not only is Will in peril, he's conspicuously so, which means he's all the more likely to meet a sad end. And Van Patten's communicated all of this in a single shot. He cuts to another establishing shot that works much like the first: in what we'll call a very long shot, the world is still white and empty of all but some men and trees. This is the classic Russian technique of turning a forest into the cinematic equivalent of a barren desert: the only life visible is either human or snow-coated evergreen. These riders..." />

Now on to &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007HJ84ZK/diesekoschmar-20" target="_self">Winter Is Coming</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>For those of you who haven&#39;t read George R.R. Martin&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553386794/diesekoschmar-20" target="_self"><em>Games of Thrones</em></a>, it&#39;s important to note that there are <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/POV_Character" target="_self">twenty-four characters</a> through whose perspective the narrative is occasionally focalized, meaning that the writers and directors of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008CLI3TE/diesekoschmar-20" target="_self">the television series</a> needed to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CXC6/diesekoschmar-20" target="_self">go full-<em>Rashomon</em></a> or find another way to imbue each episode with the feel of perspectival diversity. Which makes the decision to open &quot;Winter Is Coming&quot; with the Prologue odd but instructive. On the one hand, beginning where the novel begins is a simple decision: Martin placed the Prologue where he did because he wanted to set the mood for the scenes to come and director Tim Van Patten followed suit. On the other hand, in an episode that can only be 52 minutes long and in which numerous perspectives must be introduced, devoting 11 minutes to the quick end of the short life of Will, the Prologue&#39;s narrator, seems excessive. I&#39;m going to argue otherwise: what the material contained in the Prologue provides the audience is a means of sympathizing with the different perspectives on Will&#39;s life and death, and in so doing begins to recreate the structure of the novel. But I&#39;m getting ahead of myself here. First we need to be introduced to Will:</p>

Before we even meet Will, then, Van Patten informs us that he is a small man beholden to powers great enough to build and maintain that wall, and that he is likely in peril, because no one who isn&#39;t builds and lives behind a wall like that. Moreover, the contrast between the blue-white snow and the black riders suggests that not only is Will in peril, he&#39;s conspicuously so, which means he&#39;s all the more likely to meet a sad end. And Van Patten&#39;s communicated all of this <em>in a single shot</em>. </p>

<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2bd399970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00003" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2bd399970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2bd399970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00003" /></a><br />He cuts to another establishing shot that works much like the first: in what we&#39;ll call a very <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48039" target="_self">long shot</a>, the world is still white and empty of all but some men and trees. This is the classic Russian technique of turning a forest into the cinematic equivalent of a barren desert: the only life visible is either human or snow-coated evergreen. These riders aren&#39;t as tiny as they were in the opening shot, but the scale still makes them appear vulnerable because they&#39;re still dominated by the other elements of the frame. The <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#38561" target="_self">deep focus </a>suggests that all of the elements in the scene may be of equal importance, which is strange because the only visible elements are the people and the trees. Combined with the relatively <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/mise-en-scene.htm#140477" target="_self">high-key lighting</a>, which should allow us to see everything in the scene, the deep focus creates the conflicting impression that we <em>can</em> see everything in the scene, but that there&#39;s something in it that we&#39;re still not seeing. But if it&#39;s there why can&#39;t we see it?</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fd90af970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00006" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fd90af970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fd90af970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00006" /></a><br />It could be because <em>we</em> are the something we can&#39;t see and we&#39;re watching the riders approach from our <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48019" target="_self">point-of-view</a>. Intimating that camera&#39;s perspective belongs to something monstrous is quite common in horror films and series. For example, the first episode of <em>The Walking Dead</em>, &quot;Days Gone By,&quot; <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/amc-the-walking-dead-series-lecture-notes.html" target="_self">fiddled with this suggested perspective for nearly five minutes</a> before dispensing with the conceit. Van Patten only plays with it momentarily, but the effect is unsettling enough because as the riders move closer to the camera, their faces become more distinct, and the more we can distinguish about them from their faces, the more likely we are sympathize with them. In the <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48039" target="_self">long shot</a> above, the rider&#39;s face betrays a wariness about what&#39;s behind the trees, and well he should, because it might be us and we might be a monster. We&#39;re not. However!</p>

What&#39;s over there? The <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48043" target="_self">medium long shot</a> allows us not only to see his face, but to see it clearly enough for Van Patten to create an <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#98485" target="_self">eyeline match</a> between what Will and what he sees:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fda0de970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00012" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fda0de970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fda0de970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00012" /></a><br />What is that? Another long shot of trees in deep focus. It should be disconcerting for the same reason the previous long shot of trees in deep focus was: we <em>should </em>be able to see everything in the shot, but there&#39;s nothing that demands our attention except maybe a little mist. The shot is highly structured: on the vertical axis, two trees occupy the central area and two more flank the left and right sides of the frame. A single line of dark something bisects the frame horizontally. When a shot is this structured it suggests either <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/02/doctor-who-time-of-angels-lecture-notes.html" target="_self">literal </a>or <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/09/mad-men-in-the-suitcase.html" target="_self">figurative</a> confinement. Encountering the symmetry of entrapment in the middle of a vast wood compounds the earlier disquieting suggestions and doesn&#39;t Will know it:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c0c53970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00013" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c0c53970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c0c53970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00013" /></a><br />Or maybe he doesn&#39;t. The <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48047" target="_self">medium close-up</a> alone just indicates that we&#39;re looking at him looking at those eerily symmetrical trees. But wait!</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3209e41d970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00014" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3209e41d970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3209e41d970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00014" /></a><br />Van Patten begins <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48521" target="_self">zooming</a> in from the medium close-up into <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48048" target="_self">a genuine close-up</a>. We may have the beginning of what I refer to as a &quot;<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/01/follow-that-thought.html" target="_self">thinking zoom</a>,&quot; in which a director zooms in on a character&#39;s face in order to indicate that that character has had a thought. Did Will?</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdb183970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00017" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdb183970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdb183970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00017" /></a><br />Will most certainly did. Note that when Van Patten zoomed into the <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48049" target="_self">extreme close-up</a> he also elevates the <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48009" target="_self">level of framing</a> slightly in order to emphasize Will&#39;s widening eyes. Will&#39;s not just thinking that there&#39;s something&#39;s odd about those trees, he believes he&#39;s seen something that verifies his thoughts. He&#39;s not sure he&#39;s seen what he thinks he&#39;s seen but he&#39;s not about to take a chance:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db61bc970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00020" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db61bc970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db61bc970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00020" /></a><br />He climbs a drift to take a closer look at the trees and examine what he thinks he might have seen. He looks to his left and Van Patten employs another eyeline match to show us what Will sees near that mist:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdbb07970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00021" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdbb07970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdbb07970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00021" /></a><br />The long shot of the mist clears up one thing: it&#39;s smoke not mist. But the long shot doesn&#39;t provide enough visual information for us to make any sense of it. There&#39;s smoke and some other things there but it&#39;s difficult to discern what those other things are. But there are some disturbing inferences for Will to draw from what he can see: the first is that these riders aren&#39;t alone, someone else set and abandoned that fire; the second is that something bad may have happened to that someone else because people don&#39;t abandon fires in this environment unless they have good reason to. Why am I discussing this long shot as if it&#39;s a point-of-view shot from Will&#39;s perspective? Because I think it is. Van Patten&#39;s bridging these shots together via eyeline matches:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db6d4d970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00024" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db6d4d970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db6d4d970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00024" /></a><br />When he cuts back to Will behind the drift, Will looks to his right instead of his left this time and sees:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c3823a7970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00025" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c3823a7970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c3823a7970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00025" /></a><br />An extreme close-up of a head upon a stake. The zoom from the long shot of the smoke to the close-up of the head is the point-of-view equivalent of the thinking zoom. Instead of zooming into the mind of the character thinking, this zoom approximates what happens when a perspectival character paying more attention to an object in the <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/basic-terms.htm#16992" target="_self">mise-en-scene</a>. Van Patten provides further evidence that Will&#39;s been thinking when he cuts back to him:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdcbbb970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00030" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdcbbb970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdcbbb970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00030" /></a><br />Moving in to a close-up on the reverse is something like an implied thinking zoom. It also provides us with a better opportunity to read Will&#39;s face and sympathize with the horror written upon it. There&#39;s an intimacy to a close-up that naturally engenders sympathy in audience members who capable of it. It can also be quite creepy, as demonstrated by <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/graphics/ewsclose.jpg" target="_self">the image from </a><em><a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/graphics/ewsclose.jpg" target="_self">Eyes Wide Shut</a> </em>that the Yale Film Analysis site uses an example. Where exactly are we, the audience, in relation to Cruise and Kidman in that shot? That&#39;s right: we&#39;re standing three inches from their noses while they&#39;re making out. Point being: we can more clearly read Will&#39;s face now and that allows us to better sympathize with the dismay he feels at what he&#39;s seeing. Which is:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c33a2970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00031" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c33a2970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c33a2970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00031" /></a><br />He looked to his left and his right before looking straight ahead and taking in the whole scene. Remember earlier when I mentioned that the high-key lighting and deep focus suggested that we should&#39;ve been able to see something that wasn&#39;t there? This may be that something. Even the way Van Patten edited this sequence suggests that this is something Will didn&#39;t want to be seeing: he looked left and couldn&#39;t make it out, looked right and noticed the head on the stake, and only then did he confront what he didn&#39;t want to see. But there the ghastly scene is and he has no choice but to survey it. Then of course run. Running is a bad thing for a member of the Night&#39;s Watch to do: the penalty for running is death. His companions think him a coward and ask him if he wants to run. He declines and decides to return to the scene of the massacre. But when he returns with his fellow riders there&#39;s nothing there. No mutilated corpses. No heads on spikes. Just trees and snows and the remains of that fire and what&#39;s this?</p>

<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db995c970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00062" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db995c970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744db995c970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00062" /></a><br />He doesn&#39;t mean the trees and snow. Note the difference in the <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#38662" target="_self">depth of field</a> in this series of <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#51531" target="_self">reverse shots</a>. The rider with the red something is shot in deep focus, whereas his companion is shot in <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#38599" target="_self">shallow</a>. The shallow focus allows the white walker to enter the frame without being immediately intelligible. It&#39;s a tall something with blue eyes whose creepiness is partly a function of our inability to see exactly who or what it is. Like the earlier shots of the forest, this use of shallow focus is another means of showing the audience what&#39;s there without exactly showing us what&#39;s there. The horror, in short, is a function of what we imagine we see when it&#39;s not there and can&#39;t quite focus on when it is. The least horrifying shot in the sequence is the one immediately above because we can so clearly see what&#39;s in it. But that&#39;s only because I captured one of the two or three frames in which the white walker&#39;s visible. If you watch the episode, that frame occupies the screen for a split-second before Van Patten cuts to poor Will:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdfd26970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00065" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdfd26970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31fdfd26970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00065" /></a><br />Poor Will who was right about everything but not believed. Van Patten continues using shallow focus here because he&#39;s already established that terrible things can appear in it. As it happens what&#39;s frightening Will now is directly in front of him: it&#39;s the white walker about to behead his only remaining companion. Will now has no choice but to run, and run with the knowledge that he&#39;s running<em> from</em> one certain death <em>to</em> another. Which is exactly what happens:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c6629970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00125" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c6629970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c2c6629970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00125" /></a><br />The transition from the snow-covered forest to the green field full of knights straddles the opening credit sequence, but the contrast makes it point nonetheless: not only has poor Will run, he&#39;s run quite far and possibly for quite some time, but he hasn&#39;t outrun the horrors he saw or the death he sentenced himself to. He could&#39;ve chosen to die at the hands of the white walker beyond the wall, but instead he ran until reached Winterfell, where at least he&#39;ll die at the hands of human being. </p>
<p>All of which is very sad. </p>
<p>Which was my point: Van Patten creates a very sympathetic portrayal of Will in order to use that sympathy to distinguish the perspectives of the characters in Winterfell by virtue of how they react to him. He can&#39;t replicate the structure of the book, but as I&#39;ll discuss tomorrow, he can create situations in which the content of those individual chapters is efficiently communicated.</p>

<p>There&#39;s something else going on in this scene as well: The arrangement of the &quot;Winter is Coming&quot; bodies in the circle is weirdly symbolic, i.e. it seems structured like some kind of symbol. Jump ahead to the end of season one to &quot;Fire and Blood,&quot; and Drogo&#39;s funeral pyre is reminiscent of that same structure. </p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/RwGMAi" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/RwGMAi</a></p>

<p>A Song of Ice and Fire: <i>Winter</i> is Coming, <i>Fire</i> and Blood, the land of always winter vs the desert, yet that death symbol links them all. It&#39;s an interesting way to visually tie the end of the first season back to its origins.</p></span>

I suppose I&#39;ll find out as I re-read them for the class. (I&#39;d just flip to the chapter, but that&#39;s one thing the Kindle&#39;s just rot at.) But I like the idea that I completely missed: the frost desert in the first episode and the actual one in the last, possibly linked by the same symbol somehow found half a world away. I don&#39;t want to head in a Von Daniken, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have to.</p>

<p>And for the record, even if I don&#39;t respond to all your posts, I just want to say that I&#39;ve really appreciated your comments of late. I end up thinking about them more often than responding to them for some reason. I&#39;ll try to rectify that in the future.

And the director&#39;s comments on &quot;Fire and Blood&quot; said (IIRC) that the arrangement of the pyre was something they came up with fairly late in the making of that episode, so if there was an intended connection it wasn&#39;t planned from episode 1.</p></span>

<p>The portrayal of Game of Thrones is much different when expressed as a show, rather than a novel.  High fantasy is sadly ignored in films and television, probably because recreating a fantasy novel is a lengthy task. However, the major components of a high fantasy novel are the content and descriptive qualities surrounding the folklore itself. While I believe think the show’s directing by Tim Van Patten, does the story justice, many things are left out in the first scenes that were in the novel. The internal character’s feelings in the first scenes, expressed in detail in the novel, are left out of the television show. This includes Will’s feelings towards Ser Waymar Royce.  It leaves audiences with a lot of room to use their imagination and doesn’t focus on Will as a major character, but rather as a scapegoat to start the novel, by foreshadowing the brutality and intensity of the show. The writers have focused on only enough details for each scene to make it to the next.  In a 52 minute episode, there is not enough time to fully access internal representations or body language that characters may be experiencing. Will’s fate was portrayed with a lot less emphasis in the television show. The entire opening scene is cut short and doesn’t seem to have a very weighty structural benefit, although it does serve the same purpose as a general introduction to viewers. Director Van Patten, chose to alter the depiction of Will, because he has to portray a myriad of character introductions in the first episode, as well as paint accurate portrayals in a very short time span. The depiction of Will’s fate, and as a character, is a lot less important than the introduction of royalty. <br />

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c32ae5236970b-content"><p>The first two episodes of Game of Thrones give the viewer a lot of detail to think about as the story unfolds. Every small subtlety that Van Patten includes, gives the viewer a remarkably cohesive representation that can condense chapters of a fantasy novel into 55 minute episodes. On the Acephalous Blog (Game of Thrones Post 2), the claustrophobic effect inside of the castle is addressed. Will is not viewed as significant to the characters in this shot, so I don’t believe it was supposed to invoke any sense of urgency. I believe that the most important element in the shot is the intimate connection between Ned and Catelyn. Again, the shot does not portray a sense of urgency; it is just addressing the natural Stark family values and shows the viewer, through special proximity, the underlying emphasis on family values and lineage. In the first blog post, the medium “thinking zoom” pertaining to Will was discussed. I believe that Will is just a scapegoat for the viewers, leading to a greater understanding of the Stark family values and the introduction of the White Walkers. I don’t think you could really categorize this as a “complete thinking zoom,” from Will’s perspective. Rather, I think Van Patten was trying to emphasize the sheer terror in Will’s facial expression and helplessness of the extreme danger of the situation. The viewers already know that if Will deserts the battlefield, he will be killed for being a deserter. Will’s only significance is that he is the perfect catalyst for the conflict to commence. Also, before Ser Waymar Royce is attacked by the White Walker, the White Walker is shown in a medium, shallow focus. As viewers, we can infer from the focus that this character is not prominent on the continent of Westeros. </p></span>

So here’s a convenient wrap-up of my posts on the subject: Part I: In which we learn the value of staring. Part II: In which we learn about invisible lines and the value of staring at paintings. Part III: In which we learn about the color blue and that sometimes looking is important too. I also wrote a post about Walter White and white supremacism but it’s only tangentially related to “Gliding Over All.” So there it is: three posts about a single episode that don’t even begin to do it justice. There may be one more on the horizon, but for now the bulk of my visual rhetoric-related work will consist of readings of the first season of Game of Thrones for my Fall course. I should have the first (of many) posts up tomorrow.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/09/people-who-only-talk-to-themselves-either-already-are-or-drive-themselves-crazy.html"><span><strong>People who only talk to themselves either already are or drive themselves crazy.</strong> After the past week and, well, the past twenty-four hours, I think it's become clear to conservatives that their strategy to install Mitt Romney in the White House has failed. As strategies go, it had its charms: conservatives would only talk and watch and read other conservatives, thereby eliminating the possibility that they might hear or see or read anything that failed to conform to their prejudices. For months, this strategy seemed to be working. They had convinced themselves and each other that Obama, being the worst president in the history of the United States, couldn't be elected again if the opposition candidate had some appeal to the center. So they chose Mitt Romney. Unfortunately, Mitt Romney also chose them. He started to appeal to the conservative base in order to acquire what had already been delivered. He was supposed to bring in the centrists, but he and his campaign chose tactics designed to further secure the base. The irony is that his appeals to the base have only angered and alienated it. His &quot;inelegant&quot; iterations of their cherished theories have set the terms of the national debate against conservatives, such that any argument about equitable taxation must begin by discussing the 47 percent instead of job creation. In the war to frame the debate, conservatives now believe, Mitt Romney has unwittingly played the role of Benedict Arnold. With the former opportunist Romney now considered an extremist, what are the actual extremists to do? If the past week is any indication, they are going to spend the next two months losing their shit to establish their bona fides. Now that they have no reason to appeal to center, or to rational thought generally, we are in for two months of: Barack Obama has been building a cult of personality reminiscent of fascist leaders. That doesn’t mean he’s a fascist; it doesn’t mean that he’s Hitler or Mussolini or Stalin. But his semiotics and iconography are far more suited for a fascist country than a vibrant republic. Of course Ben Shapiro has no clue what &quot;semiotics&quot; actually means, but it makes him sound like an authority on something, in this case the &quot;fascist&quot; field of branding. Instead of being annoyed that, from Shepard Fairey forward, the Obama campaign team has simply demonstrated a more sophisticated understanding of contemporary advertising than any of its Republican opponents, Shapiro wants to claim that the use of &quot;iconography&quot; is &quot;far more suited for a fascist country than a vibrant republic.&quot; And it doesn't matter how many images of the Twin Towers falling or acting Presidents in flight suits you show him, Shapiro will never believe that any other administration has ever used the power of singular images to sway public opinion. It's only ever been Obama. This is but the tip of the iceberg. The knotted fringes of the far right movement no longer have any reason to remain tangled, so as their weak coalitions unravel expect to hear more about every inane and insane...</span></a></div>
