<p>As a conservative Canadian, you must realize that, in America, you belong to the loony left, like myself and all other people who want to indict numerous administration officials for criminal negligence.  As a lawyer, you should be able to tell us: is &quot;Brownie&quot; so imcompetent as to be criminally liable for the deaths in New Orleans?  (Even if only in Canada?)  After learning about <a href="http://rhosgobel.blogspot.com/2005/09/historical-comparison.html" rel="nofollow">all of this incredibly infuriating information</a>, and then about, say, the fact that Bush and First Lady Laura both 1) made starving refugees <i>wait to eat</i> until they arrived to feed them--&quot;Sorry, you can&#39;t eat yet, this is <i>special food</i>, only the President or First Lady can hand it to you&quot;--and then 2) dismantling these photo op. &quot;shelters&quot; the minute POTUS or his wife left, I want to scream emotions I don&#39;t even have the words to express.  These #$!%($%!$ left starving people waiting for food because their photo op. finished!?!  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-9107755-content"><p>It&#39;s deplorable. And you can beat I&#39;ll be following all the legal angles of this story. Frankly, all I know is that if, say, a large earthquake and tsunami had hit the Lower Mainland of BC, and we had similar incompetence and malfeasance from our elected officials, they would be out of office using that wonderful feature of parliamentary democracy, the no-confidence vote. I just wonder if any American politician has the guts to try to hold Bush accountable. Senator Landrieu threatening to punch him on national TV was a good start.</p>

<p>(And by no means am I a conservative, even by Canadian standards. That makes me a stark raving socialist by American standards, even though I share some ideas with libertarians about economic policy.)</p></span>

So coming soon, as in &quot;after the post after this one,&quot; I'll try to return to the model I'd previously established and stuck to. Because blogs should consider audience. And because I enjoy blogging more when I do so. (Venting is good. Not having much to vent about is better.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/dreamy_architec.html"><span><strong>Dreamy Architecture &amp; Communion With the Dead (Suspected, Never Verified)</strong> On the way to San Francisco we stopped to visit The Winchester Mystery House. What intrigued me about this place is how much it resembles, in house-form, the architectural mode that makes Urbino the most interesting city on the planet. Characterized by more local decisions with global consequences than the world's witnessed prior to the current adminstration's &quot;management&quot; of domestic, international and interpersonal politics, Urbino was built in fits and starts over a couple of hundred years, resulting in a scene-scape which resembles a dream-scape more than a city-scape. Building upon building ascending endlessly (until reaching the birthplace of Raffaello) and then with burning calves and tightened thighs you turn and realize that not only can you ascend further but that the two available routes appear suddenly, as if the walls on your right rift for you alone. To your left is a path hardly discernable from the walls which border it and seems to consist of three ramps, seven of steps, then a stairway of such unreal steepness you reach for the ropes you'll undoubtedly need to descend it. The Winchester Mystery House, while not quite as counterintuitive as Urbino, is as haphazardly constructed (only not nearly so substantial). Its owner, the widowed heiress of the Winchester Rifle fortune, invested her inheritance in a lucrative scheme to ameliorate the souls (mostly Native American) wounded and killed by Winchester rifles. So she built stairs ascending into ceilings, doors which open onto fifteen foot falls or bricked-up walls, &amp;c. I'll post more pictures whenever I figure out how to exploit Flickr's more than ample bandwith. I realize how &quot;bloggy&quot; this entry is. I may well deserve banishment to livejournal. At least I'm not whinging about things I'm incapable of changing.</span></a></div>
