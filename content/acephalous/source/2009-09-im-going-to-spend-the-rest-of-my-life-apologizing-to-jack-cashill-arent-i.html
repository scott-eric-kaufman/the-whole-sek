<p>If you subtract the sources I asterisked because they were counted in previous chapters, the final tally of Andersen's 200 some interviews is an impressive 43.&nbsp; That means that only 157 or so of them were unwilling to speak truth to the powerful lies of the President on the record.&nbsp; That so few of them were willing to follow the example of the young Obama's "roommate and closest friend . . . Siddiqi" and speak on the—<em>hold on a minute</em>.&nbsp; Does anyone see Siddiqi's name among those listed as interviewees?&nbsp; <em>No</em>?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Must be Andersen toeing the ethical line again and passing off information from someone else's published work as original research.&nbsp; No big deal: Siddiqi told <em>someone </em>that he had no memory of Obama having had a "year-long relationship with a rich, green-eyed lovely" who, as Cashill corroborated via independent textual sleuthing, was actually Ayers's former flame, Diana Oughton.&nbsp; The credibility of Siddiqi's memories is further enhanced by the fact that when he lived with Obama, he spent the majority of his time snorting cocaine, smoking marijuana, and perfecting his <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/01/20/nyregion/obamaandroommate-480.jpg">Cheech impersonation</a>.&nbsp; Who <em>wouldn't</em> believe his memory of that period is infallible?</p>



<p> Cashill anticipates that the critics who balk at the "lack of attribution by Andersen" or believe that "the citation of [Cashill] as a source and/or a reliance upon [him] as a source" constitutes a demonstration of intellectual unseriousness.&nbsp; Neither of those positions (<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/10/who-really-wrot.html">both of which</a> <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/turns-out-i-owe-jack-cashill-an-apology.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5f20bd9970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5f20bd9970c">I have taken</a>) "imply," as Cashill claims, "that Andersen is a fraud and a liar and that he contrived the story he told" <em>because I'm not implying anything</em>. </p>

<p>The sloppiness of Andersen's research <em>demonstrably proves </em>that he's not the sort of celebrity biographer an intelligent person trusts with anonymous sources.&nbsp; Andersen's inability to recognize the worthlessness of Cashill's impressionistic "textual sleuthing" <em>demonstrably proves </em>that he's not the sort of celebrity biographer an intelligent person trusts to do responsible literary analysis.&nbsp; Need I remind you of the <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/06/polygraphlevel-scholarship-may-suffice-for-harmless-speculation-about-the-authorship-of-midsummers-n.html">"quality" of Cashill's work</a>?</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The A-level match</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Cashill: </strong></p><blockquote><p>What Mr. Midwest noticed recently is that both Ayers in [<em>A Kind and Just Parent</em>] and Obama in [<em>Dreams From My Father</em>]
make reference to the poet Carl Sandburg. In itself, this is not a
grand revelation. Let us call it a C-level match. Obama and Ayers seem
to have shared the same library in any case . . . Ayers and Obama,
however, go beyond citing Sandburg. Each quotes the opening line of his
poem "<a href="http://carl-sandburg.com/chicago.htm" mce_href="http://carl-sandburg.com/chicago.htm">Chicago</a>"
. . . This I would call a B-level match. What raises it up a notch to
an A-level match is the fact that both misquote "Chicago," and they do
so in exactly the same way.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Both Ayers and Obama misquote the opening line of Carl Sandburg's "Chicago," substituting "hog butcher <em>to</em> the world" for "hog butcher <em>for</em>
the world." This mutual error would be significant (an "A-level match")

(To name <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22hog+butcher+to+the+world%22">but a few</a>.) According to Cashill, I have now proven that <em>Dreams From My Father</em> was written by many a dead man of American letters, a <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/06/polygraphlevel-scholarship-may-suffice-for-harmless-speculation-about-the-authorship-of-midsummers-n.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef01157181b597970b#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01157181b597970b" style="text-decoration: line-through;">living</a> mystery writer, a <em>New York Times</em> columnist and the 1967 Illinois Commission on Automation and Technological Progress. That bears repeating:
I have an "A-level match" that proves that Obama's autobiography was
written by a "study of the economic and social effects of automation
and other technological changes on industry, commerce, agriculture,
education, manpower, and society in Illinois" when Obama was only six
years old.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The "baleful" affair</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Cashill:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Returning to the exotic, in his Indonesian backyard
Obama discovered two "birds of paradise" running wild as well as
chickens, ducks, and a "yellow dog with a baleful howl." In [Ayers'] <em>Fugitive Days</em>, there is even more "howling" than there is in <em>Dreams</em> . . . In [<em>A Kind and Just Parent</em>], he talks specifically about a "yellow dog." And he uses the word "baleful" to describe an "eye" in <em>Fugitive Days</em>. For the record, "baleful" means "threatening harm." I had to look it up.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Cashill cited as "A-level" evidence the
fact that Ayers and Obama used a word he didn't know, despite his being
the Executive Editor of Kansas City’s premier business publication, <em>Ingram’s Magazine</em>; despite his having written for <em>Fortune</em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>, and <em>The Weekly Standard</em>; despite his having authored five books of non-fiction; and despite the word "baleful" having appeared in print <strong><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/files/342.jpg"><span class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115718069f2970b">342 times</span></a></strong> in the past six months alone. Granted, all those appearances were in high-minded literary publications like <em>Newsday</em> ("[w]ith his baleful countenance, wild hair, sonorous baritone and sage pronouncements") or leftist rags like <em>The Washington Times</em>
("warn them in baleful tones if they've forgotten, say, the
Constitution"), so it would be unreasonable to expect Cashill to have
been familiar with the word . . . or would be, were it not for the fact
that it also appears <strong><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:http://www.americanthinker.com/+baleful&hl=en&safe=off" mce_href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:http://www.americanthinker.com/+baleful&hl=en&safe=off">19 times</a></strong> in the pages of the <em>American Thinker</em>, the publication for which Cashill penned this tripe. (Seems he can begin his careful literary analysis of the other <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=baleful" mce_href="http://www.google.com/search?q=baleful">848,000 potential ghost writers</a> closer to home.)</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lawyers and legal jargon</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Cashill:</strong></p><blockquote><p>To this point, I have just skimmed the 759 items in the
bill of particulars in my case against Obama's literary genius. Not
familiar with the term "bill of particulars?" Uncertain myself, I
looked that one up too. It means a list of written statements made by a
party to a court proceeding. Ayers and Obama each refer knowingly to a
"bill of particulars." Doesn't everyone?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is no.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>The phrase "bill of particulars" is
an uncommon construction, and its repeated use indicates that the
speaker has a specialized vocabulary in which this construction
regularly appears. According to LexisNexis, this is exactly the case:
in the past six months, that exact phrase has been written <strong><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/files/billofparticulars.jpg"><span class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011571806d22970b">509 times</span></a></strong> and every single one of them looks like this:
</p><blockquote><p>United States v. Clark, NO. 05-6507, UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT, 09a0422n.06;, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS
12940; 2009 FED App. 0422N (6th Cir.), June 15, 2009, Filed, NOT
RECOMMENDED FOR FULL-TEXT PUBLICATION. SIXTH CIRCUIT RULE 28(g) LIMITS

The only people who regularly use the phrase "bill of particulars," then, are <em>lawyers</em>[.]

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Self-evidently hilarious examples of "textual sleuthing" </strong></span></p>

<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Common words are common:</strong> "Another note of interest is that all of the distinctive words in the
last sentence above—'master,' 'beast,' 'grim,' 'unapologetic,' and 'deed,' as well as the phrase 'hunkered down'—appear in <em>Fugitive Days.</em>"</li>
<li><strong>The sea is a pregnant metaphor: </strong>"Ayers and Obama both use words that relate to the sea ('fog, mist,
ships, seas, boats, oceans, calms, captains, charts, first mates,
storms, streams, wind, waves, anchors, barges, horizons, ports,
panoramas, moorings, tides, currents, and things howling, fluttering,
knotted, ragged, tangled, and murky')."</li>
<li><strong>People are lonely: </strong>"After the neighbor's death, the police let themselves into the old
man’s apartment, and for no good reason Obama finds himself in the
apartment. 'The loneliness of the scene affected me,' he writes.
Loneliness as a theme courses through <em>Fugitive Days</em> as well." </li>
<li><strong>Old men are stooped and people wear hats: </strong>"In the opening pages, Obama makes an exception to his New York solitude
for an elderly neighbor, a "stooped" gentleman who wore a 'fedora.' In <em>Fugitive Days,</em>
it was Ayers’ grandfather who was "stooped" and a helpful stranger who
wore a 'fedora.'" </li>
<li><strong>Some people are quiet: </strong>"Obama tells the reader that the neighbor’s 'silence'
impressed him. 'Silence' impressed Ayers as well. There are at least
ten references to the word in <em>Fugitive Days.</em>"</li>
<li><strong>Angry people feel rage: </strong>"[B]oth Ayers and Obama speak of 'rage' the way that Eskimos do of snow—in
so many varieties, so often, that they feel the need to qualify it,
here as 'impressive rage,' elsewhere in <em>Dreams</em> as 'suppressed rage' or 'coil of rage,' and in <em>Fugitive Days</em> as 'justifiable rage,' 'uncontrollable rage,' 'blind rage,' and, of course, 'Days of Rage.'"<br> </li>
</ol>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Kicker</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Cashill tells us he wouldn't believe himself either</strong>: "I have as much faith in the hypothesis that follows as . . . biologists do in evolution, so bear with me please
as I, like they, present my evidence in the indicative."&nbsp; He has as much "faith" in his hypothesis as biologists do in the hypothesis of evolution.&nbsp; I wonder what <em><a href="http://www.cashill.com/intellig_design/index.htm">Intelligence Design advocate</a></em> Jack Cashill has <a href="http://www.cashill.com/intellig_design/fossil_record.htm">to say</a> about that kind of faith?</p><blockquote><p>ID partisans across the board believe in
micro-evolution: that is, evolution within a species. Some believe in
evolution between species, macro-evolution, if guided. 
 </p><p class="style43">
What the ID movement challenges is Darwinian mechanics, random
variation and natural selection, an elegant idea in 1859 but in 1999
still just an idea. Neo-Darwinians have as much trouble explaining how
complex organs like a wing or an eye—or even a single cell within an
eye—could be the result of unguided, incremental change as Darwin
did. </p><p class="style43">Darwin could only hope that the fossil record would one day prove him
right. It hasn't. No evidence has surfaced of a transformation from one
species to the next. Nor has anyone offered a satisfactory explanation
for the rash of new animal life that inexplicably entered the fossil
record during the so-called Cambrian explosion. </p>

</blockquote><p class="style43">I am not about to dignify that creationist nonsense by responding to it.&nbsp; If Cashill really wants to know what use half a wing might be to a flightless bird, he can go ask a penguin.&nbsp; </p><p class="style43"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p><p class="style43">When I first <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/10/who-really-wrot.html">wrote</a> that anyone who uses "Cashill's juvenile musings as a hypothetical which, if true, suggests all the unsavory things [they] already believe about Obama," I didn't know that Cashill also bought into Intelligent Design, but it makes sense that someone who could compile and be convinced by the evidence above would be a subject of King Tendentiousness himself.&nbsp; Like ID, Cashill's theory consists of details inexpertly cobbled together by deeply interested parties.&nbsp; The similar caveat applies in both: should it turn out that one day the Great Designer reveals Himself or Obama admits that Ayers helped edit his memoir, the soundness of their respective methodologies would not be validated—all that will be proven is that sometimes tendentious idiots get lucky.</p><p class="style43"><strong>UPDATE.&nbsp; </strong>Not surprisingly, those who desperately <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15357">want the story</a> to be true believe that the two anonymous sources validate Cashill's initial findings:</p><blockquote><p class="style43">My wonder is, will these condescending literary "experts" continue to
hide behind their strained pedantic incredulity, or are they willing to
revisit this story now that additional information is available to them—information that suggests that those of us who kept an open mind . . . were far less doctrinaire in our arguments than those who, <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13398#comment-558387">in their rush to condemn</a><em> us</em> as knee-jerk political reactionaries, were themselves guilty of having prematurely ruling the possible "absurd"? </p>

</blockquote><p class="style43">And when the Great Designer parks His Flying Saucer and reveals His Plan, I will eat crow.&nbsp; Until that day, I will continue to insist that <em>The X-Files </em>was a fiction no matter how many sources, anonymous or otherwise, report having been abducted and probed.&nbsp; </p><p class="style43">(<em><a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/09/im-going-to-spend-rest-of-my-life.html">x-posted</a></em>.)</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5ae5493970b-content"><p>Surely it&#39;s a sound bet that Letitia Baldrige, Rick Lazio, Ed Koch, and John Kerry were all knowledgeable sources who assured Andersen that Bill Ayers had written <i>Dreams From My Father</i>? </p>

<p><i>Dreams From My Father</i>, incidentally, is a remarkably good book -- which bears absolutely no personal touches from Barack Obama -- considered from any angle, and which I highly recommend everyone read, and would do so if the author were, well, anybody: kudos to Bill Ayers for his mad writing skilz!  I can&#39;t imagine why Ayers hasn&#39;t had any other best-sellers.</p>

<p>Oh, wait.  </p>

<p>And, not incidentally, one of the many reasons I feel no hesitation in calling Cashhill an idiot is that he had to look up what &quot;baleful&quot; means; it&#39;s not exactly a high-falutin&#39;, obscure, word.</p>

<p>You hit the rest of the points that led to my conclusive analysis of Cashhill&#39;s text.  The man has tools of analysis like that of no other.  His articles fill a much-needed gap in the literature.</p></span>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fcashill.com+baleful" rel="nofollow">No dice</a> . . . meaning he did not, in fact, know from &quot;baleful&quot; despite being all this:</p>

<blockquote>Jack Cashill is an independent writer and producer and, on a contractual basis, the Executive Editor of Ingram’s Magazine, Kansas City’s premier business magazine.

<p>In addition to his work with Ingram’s, Jack has written for Fortune, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Weekly Standard, and regularly for WorldNetDaily. He has had one collection of essays published—Snake Handling in Mid-America and one novel—2006: The Chautauqua Rising.</p>

<p>Within the last five years Jack has written five books of non-fiction — First Strike, Ron Brown’s Body, Hoodwinked: How Intellectual Hucksters Have Hijacked American Culture, Sucker Punch: The Left Hook that Dazed Ali and Killed King&#39;s Dream and his latest, What&#39;s the Matter with California. Three of them have cracked Amazon’s top ten list. Jack has produced at least a dozen documentaries for regional PBS and national cable channels, including the Emmy Award-winning, The Royal Years.</p>

<p>Jack has also produced an audio book, Understanding America: the great speeches, sermons, documents and narratives of the American experience.</p>

<p>In addition, Jack hosted daily talk radio shows for five years—four of those with KMBZ, Kansas City’s foremost AM station, and one year with Catholic Family Radio’s national network. Jack has a Ph.D. from Purdue University in American studies, has taught media and literature at Purdue and at Kansas City area universities, and served as a Fulbright professor in France.</p>

<p>Jack&#39;s latest book, What&#39;s the Matter with California (Simon &amp; Schuster), came out in paperback in August 2008.</blockquote></p>

<p>The bar to being all that must be very, very low.</p></span>

<p>...not to mention expressly prohibited by every journal I&#39;ve come across.  The managing editor isn&#39;t allowed to include his or her own work because they&#39;re in a position to taint the blind review process: even if they don&#39;t have the final decision on their article, they&#39;ve talked to the other editors about their own work and it would be recognized fairly quickly.  </p>

<p><em>But if it wasn&#39;t Ayers what helped him, who did? </em></p>

<p>apples to oranges it was his editor at Three Rivers Press, the same way editors like Gordon Lish helped <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2007/12/19/talking_about_editing_ray_carver/" rel="nofollow">turn Raymond Carver into Raymond Carver</a>.  That&#39;s what Mr. Occam tells me---well, that and that the most likely reason for the stylistic difference between <em>Dreams</em> and <em>Audacity</em> has something to do with Three Rivers being merged into Crown and him working with a different editor.  All memoirs are edited, I&#39;m not arguing otherwise.  The crazy element here is the belief that, of all the people in all the world, it&#39;s Bill Ayers who edited <em>Dreams</em>.  </p>

<p>Contrary to what Jeff <em>et al</em> would have you believe, the <em>only</em> evidence of Ayers&#39;s involvement comes from the two anonymous sources---because Cashill&#39;s analysis, as I think I&#39;ve sufficiently demonstrated, is easily falsifiable junk, a random collocation of common words and streets scenes made meaningful by someone with a mind predisposed to doing that.  Hence, his defense of ID, which plays fast and loose with facts in this exact same manner.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5af368f970b-content"><p>I&#39;ll respect your opinion of Cashill&#39;s analysis of Dreams! because that is your profession.  But despite all of your &quot;search hits&quot; for some of the phrase usages he cites, you ignore the cumulative nature of all of these likeness occurring, individually dismissing them out of hand a priori.  I doubt that all of the authors your searches returned used every one of the phrase combinations that Obama and Ayers appear to share usage of; regardless of how trivial or asinine you feel that they are.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t understand using any particular religious belief of Cashill&#39;s as proof of his inanity.  While his ignorance of the meaning of &quot;baleful&quot; is valid to criticize, one writer to another, outside of the circles you interact in, where many similar beliefs are held, a person&#39;s personal religious beliefs are far from a convincing indictment of either authorial legitiamcy, intellectual savvy or even sanity.</p>

<p>I understand that you may not agree with Cashill or Andersen, and may have a professional skepticism based on what you believe are shoddy techniques.  That&#39;s a professional opinion.  But basing, in part, your disbelief on the fact that you disagree with other works they&#39;ve successfully published, views thay have professed, or religious beliefs may make for amusing snark but is not firm footing for a refutation of their theses.</p>

<p>And forgive me for making assumptions, but I get the impression that you would not have questioned the veracity of Bob Woodward, Carl Bernstein, or their &quot;Watergate&quot; expose, a piece run largely based on information supplied by an anonymous source, &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, whose identity was not revealed until much later; regardless of either writers lack of credential, professional accomplishment, or journalistic bona fides at that time.  Perhaps that&#39;s because Nixon was not as sympathetic a character to you then as Obama is today, something only you know.</p>

<p>Me? I&#39;m classically disinterested in this matter one way or another.  Mr. Obama is already the President, and support for him will not turn on this matter alone.  If false or lost to the &quot;memory hole&quot;, then no big deal, and as I said if it gains traction, it alone will not do signifigant damage.  The only way it could hurt him if true would be to expose a basic veracity problem that some in this nation feel he is developing a reputation for.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that you are as disinterested frankly, both for personal as well as ideological reasons.  While the tone in this essay is entertaining in places, and some of your arguments thought provoking, keep in mind that you are no more right than others who hold the opposing point of view.  Unlike more technical disciplines, this is a subjective analysis; especially since you have no direct communication with either writer.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a5af4651970b-content"><p>Beginning at the end:</p>

<p><em>especially since you have no direct communication with either writer</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s their fault, not mine.  I&#39;ve made every effort to contact both.</p>

<p><em>keep in mind that you are no more right than others who hold the opposing point of view</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing, though: I actually am.  Using Cashill&#39;s own standars, I could demonstrate that Shakespeare wrote 90 percent of Romantic Poetry because there&#39;s nothing unique about the working vocabulary of post-Shakespearean poets---they all borrowed heavily from the Bard, so a simple tabulation of common occurances would almost always result in a false positive.  </p>

<p>Moreover, stylistic similarity is not, in and of itself, proof of authorship.  How do you prove one person wrote two books based on style alone?  You begin by praying that person is not James Joyce, because you could maybe prove that the man who wrote <em>Dubliners</em> also wrote <em>Stephen Hero</em>, and that the man who wrote <em>Portrait</em> wrote the first three chapters of <em>Ulysses</em>, but it would be extremely difficult to prove that the same man wrote each of the subsequent chapters, much less the <em>Wake</em>.  </p>

<p>Grant that the hypothetical author is not a similar linguistic virtuoso, and the first element that needs to be eliminated are the predominant features of a the genre in which the books are written.  For example: the fact that two mystery novels both prominently feature private investigators, blondes with legs up to here, and tense conversations that lead to violence proves nothing about whether a particular author wrote a particular pair of mysteries.  In the same vein, the fluidity of identity and the instability of memory are generic features of memoirs for the obvious reason that the author is slowly reevaluating his or her life. </p>

<p>When we say that we hardly recognize the person we were as a teenager, we are discussing the fluidity of identity; and were we writing a memoir, we would be muttering something to that effect every two minutes.  When we fail to remember when it was that we went on that boat trip or baseball game with our father, we are discussing the instability of memory; and were we writing a memoir, we would be consulting friends and family on a regular basis in order to clarify when this or that happened.  Maybe they would remember, but maybe they would remember differently, thereby challenging both your own memory of the event and theirs. </p>

<p>Such realizations---and explicit articulations of them---are so common in memoir as a genre that they can&#39;t be used as identifying characteristics in the way Cashill uses them.  They&#39;re not distinctive.</p>

<p><em>I don&#39;t think that you are as disinterested frankly, both for personal as well as ideological reasons.</em></p>

<p>Close: I&#39;m not disinterested because Cashill&#39;s making a mockery of my <em>profession</em>, and it&#39;s difficult enough for me to claim that I have standards, and that they&#39;re rigorously adhered to, when the kind of vaguely associative work Cashill does becomes &quot;literary criticism&quot; in the common currency.  </p>

<p><em>And I don&#39;t understand using any particular religious belief of Cashill&#39;s as proof of his inanity.</em></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say it was Cashill&#39;s religious beliefs that make him an untrustworthy carekeeper of fact, but his belief in Intelligent Design.  ID is a parody of science: it looks like honest inquiry, but it&#39;s not because the conclusion is always foregone.  Unlike those who study evolutionary theory, whose conception of what constitutes &quot;evolution&quot; and &quot;natural selection&quot; has been in flux---put to the scientific method---almost since the day Darwin published the <em>Origin</em>.  Evolutionary theory adapts to changing facts; ID finds  errant facts that will buttress its core belief.</p>

<p><em>I doubt that all of the authors your searches returned used every one of the phrase combinations that Obama and Ayers appear to share usage of; regardless of how trivial or asinine you feel that they are.</em></p>

<p>The odds of there being a third book that shares all those terms is very slim---so slim, in fact, <em>that none of Ayers&#39;s other books appear either</em>.  That has nothing to do with Ayers/Obama and everything to do with the infinite nature of language.  The fact that Cashill&#39;s &quot;experiment&quot; can&#39;t even prove that <em>Ayers</em> is the author of his other books says something about the soundness of his methodology.  </p>

<p>Also of note is that Cashill draws his examples from <em>multiple</em> books by Ayers.  If you were to hand me four books by F. Scott Fitzgerald, I bet you I can prove he wrote one by Hemingway or, honestly, almost any other 20th Century American writer.</p></span>

&quot;<i>Wrong, wrong, wrong. Aside from the ad hominem speculation, &quot;Deep Throat&quot; was one source</i>&quot;</p>

<p>I never said they had any more than one source...</p>

<p>&quot;<i>...what they reported was confirmed from published sources and cited interviews</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>Episodes that occurred well after that of the story breaking, as I recall.  Seems like the stuff of &quot;cart before the horse&quot;...</p>

<p>&quot;<i>He was not anonymous to their editor, who needed Felt&#39;s identity </i>...&quot;</p>

<p>But the fact remains that that same identity was secret from the public at large who made judgements based on that story as well as the investigators later.  So, since the source remained anonymous to just about everyone until his recent death, that&#39;s the same as Andersens&#39;s sources, who are known but to him...<br />

<p>At any rate, Bob (who spurns local government by arguing for governing by national polling: <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/polls-despite-seemingly-rough-few-months-obama-can-smile.php?ref=fpblg" rel="nofollow">incidentally</a>), apart from the undergraduate&#39;s whiny &quot;that&#39;s just your opinion,&quot; you have anything else to say about the <a href="http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/vocabulary.htm" rel="nofollow">Baleful Cashill&#39;s</a> magic search database? After you&#39;re done with that, perhaps you can join McCash in arguing that Marie de France wrote La vie seinte Audree (see Speculum 77 (2002): 744-77). &lt;- note. Medievalist joke. I won&#39;t explain.</p>

<p><i>as far as I know without being called out.</i><br />
Oh, I did. I also asked where HF received his terminal degree. No answer, of course.</p>

<p>And HF seems to be confusing the marketing of first ladies with the actual accomplishments of first ladies.</p>

<p>As for &quot;literary types&quot;: wtf? Yeah, and my legislators tend to have pretty bad taste in music too. So what?</p></span>

None of the current crop of complaints are explicitly about race any more than Buchanan's speech at the 1992 Republican Convention was, but now as then, one look at the enemy they fear and the forces they align against it and the identity of their antagonists becomes obvious. The question, then, is whether this is a story we want told twice. America, conservatives insist, bought a false sale of goods, and the only way Obama can sustain his popularity is to pull the wool before our eyes via the political equivalent of an atomic wedgie: overt propaganda. Attacking the National Endowment for the Arts comes straight from the '90s script: every dollar the NEA disburses will be tracked by the likes of Andrew Breitbart until the perfect moment to introduce the world to the next &quot;Piss Christ&quot; arrives. They've already begun to remind the troops of all the old tropes, but their attempt to preemptively undermine the institutional credibility of the NEA indicates that this generation of conservative critics might be more media savvy than their '90s counterparts. Tim Slagle's response to a recent MoveOn campaign is a sign of smears to come:It looks like the NEA’s call for artists to promote health care initiatives has been heard by some comedy artists. MoveOn was not a party to the infamous conference call, but because it involves actors, and actors are artists, it's a party to the propaganda agenda established during that call. As a consequence of that call, all artists—whether they shoot a crucifix in urine like Andrew Serrano or urinate on themselves like Will Ferrell—will be seen as complicit in a conspiracy to undermine America so grand even Goebbels would blush. But while they may be savvy, they're far from smart. In the article quoted above, Slagle offers a &quot;prize to anyone who can name all eight [actors in the MoveOn video] without using Google,&quot; includes the name of all of them in his tags not once, but twice, and his commenters are still stumped. And the one and odious John Ziegler calls for a return to &quot;the Golden Age of television (the 70's and 80's),&quot; when Americans came together to laugh at black people for the wrong reasons, before he realized—or was told—that he should be laughing at Archie Bunker, not with him. That his list of programs excludes The Cosby Show is no surprise. He prefers Sanford...</span></a></div>

This is a Doctor of Journalism.*</strong> Our arrival was badly timed. Most of the pigs from The American Spectator had already arrived. I saw this at a glance. They were just standing around trying to look casual. It was a terrifying scene. &quot;I thought you should know about this,&quot; the boy said finally. &quot;Know? Me? Know about what?&quot; I asked. &quot;Nothing. Nothing at all. Just that this guy . . . this white supremacist guy . . . he says he's you.&quot; My brain locked up. I couldn't think. The drugs were taking over. &quot;Is he?&quot; &quot;No . . . I don't think . . . but he did say something about guns and booze.&quot; &quot;Guns and booze? Guns and booze? Must be me.&quot; Jesus. What a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid. Alright, I thought. &quot;Alright,&quot; I said. &quot;This Nazi me with guns and gin, where . . .&quot; &quot;No gin . . . he's just talking about gin like you talk about it when you . . .&quot; &quot;Look,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm a Doctor of Journalism. If I can't minister to my own sober self, what good am I?&quot; I demanded the boy take me to myself. He led me to a dense thicket of birches fit for Frost and introduced me as Manuel. &quot;Well,&quot; I said. &quot;Pleasure to make my acquaintance.&quot; That me looked at this me confused. Something there is that loves a wall, I thought, and ain't that bastard something. There he was, talking about my Samoan attorney, and here I was, looking at myself talking about my Samoan attorney . . . but what white power me said made no sense. &quot;Wherever you find guns, cigars and whiskey, good-looking womenfolk are sure to be flocking 'round, and I had my camera handy for the occasion.&quot; &quot;Flocking 'round&quot;? Sounds nothing like me. Strange memories of nervous nights on who knows what I can handle . . . but this was an impostor. No . . . a robot. I was being impersonated by a robot. Programmed to say what I say but like I was Rhett Butler. To trick it would require saying something it wouldn't expect me to . . . &quot;All this white shit on my sleeve is LSD,&quot; I heard myself say. Shit. I stole a glance at myself and saw his face turn white. I noted the effort it took for him to keep up my façade. Not that he didn't try. &quot;Folks around Sperryville won't go anywhere near the place at Pig Roast time, what with the rumors of cannibalism, human sacrifice, bizarre pagan rituals and so forth.&quot; &quot;And so forth?&quot; I asked. &quot;And so forth?&quot; &quot;Wherever you find guns, cigars and whiskey, good-looking womenfolk are sure to be flocking 'round, and I had my camera handy for the occasion.&quot; &quot;You already said that you fucking robot!&quot; I threw myself at the robot but must have licked my arm on the way there because the next thing I remember I...</span></a></div>
