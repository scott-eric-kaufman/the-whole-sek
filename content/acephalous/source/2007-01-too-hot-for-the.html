philosophy of the waning <em>fin-de-siecle </em>in a compelling (if not coherent) manner, and his attempt to turn them into narratives—sometimes successfully, sometimes not—is something to marvel at.&nbsp; But to say this is <em>not</em> to say, for example, that I think everyone could benefit from reading <em>Before Adam</em>. </p></blockquote>

Part II</strong> The best sentence from the chapter I stupidly sent people this morning: His novels are therefore both nostalgic and utopian, morality plays describing how would have become Americans who they are if they had been who they are at the time of the Revolutionary or Civil Wars. See what happens when panics creeps into the night? In the shrill light of day, I recognize some of the basic errors I made. (For example, the introduction should appear earlier, maybe even in the first ten pages.) That said, I appreciate all the feedback—past, present and future—as it clarifies in hours what might otherwise take days.</span></a></div>
