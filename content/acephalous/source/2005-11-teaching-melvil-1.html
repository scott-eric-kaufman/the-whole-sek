<p>The current issue of <em><a href="http://nybooks.com/">The New York Review of Books</a></em> contains two jarringly complementary articles.&nbsp; The first is Frederick Crews' <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18510">review</a>
[subscribers only] of Andrew Delbanco's critical biography of Melville.
Delbanco treats Melville as &quot;one of those writers whom Lionel Trilling
described as 'repositories of the dialectics of their times' in the
sense that they contain 'both the yes and no of their culture.'&quot; Thus:</p><blockquote><p>Respect
for the past, in Delbanco's case, includes eschewing the revisionists'
&quot;gotcha!&quot; approach to a dead author's limitations and instead trying to
recreate the dilemmas that he faced. On the pivotal issue of
abolitionism, for example, Delbanco doesn't buy the crude idea that
Melville's reluctance to become an activist was motivated by a wish to
avoid offending his benefactor and kin, Judge Shaw. No one in
Melville's day could envision how the slaves might be emancipated
without causing secession. Although the novelist made it plain that he
detested slavery, he joined the great majority of his Northern
compatriots in hoping to avoid the gruesome war that would soon cost
over 600,000 American lives. To condemn him with the hindsight of 150
years, Delbanco would doubtless say, is simply to reveal one's own
failure of historical imagination.</p></blockquote><p>This is not historicism
for historicism's sake, according to Delbanco, but historicism in the
service of moral and political complexity. Read in his original
context, Melville should not be censured for his failure to condemn
slavery because the experience of living in a tumultuous time includes
&quot;both the yes and no of [a] culture.&quot; Normally I find this
quasi-æstheticist pose painfully insufficient—a flaccid defense of New
Critical orthodoxy—but another article in the current <em>NYRB</em> suggests the insufficiency of my own pose.</p>

<p>William Dalrymple's &quot;<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18514">Inside the Madrasa</a>&quot; [free content] opens with the following anecdote:</p><blockquote><p>Here,
straddling the noisy, truck-thundering Islamabad highway, stands the
Haqqania, one of the most radical of the religious schools called
madrasas.</p>

<p>Many of the Taliban leaders, including Mullah Omar,
were trained at this institution. If its teachings have been blamed for
inspiring the brutal, ultra-conservative incarnation of Islamic law
that that regime presided over, there is no sign that the Haqqania is
ashamed of its former pupils: instead, the madrasa's director, Maulana
Sami ul-Haq, still proudly boasts that whenever the Taliban put out a
call for fighters, he would simply close down the madrasa and send his
students off to fight. In many ways, then, Akora Khattack represents
everything that US policymakers most fear and dislike in this region, a
bastion of religious, intellectual, and sometimes—in the form of the
Taliban—military resistance to Pax Americana and all it represents.</p></blockquote><p>This
account of Pakistani madrasas squares with what I've read for the past
four or five years; namely, that they're Saudi-financed fundamentalist
schools in which the indoctrination of radical Islamic thought occurs
daily. Then Dalrymple begins to hedge:</p><blockquote><p>It is certainly
true that many madrasas are fundamentalist and literalist in their
approach to the scriptures and that many subscribe to the most
hard-line strains of Islamic thought. Few make any effort to prepare
their students to function in a modern, plural society. It is also true
that some madrasas can be directly linked to Islamic radicalism and
occasionally to outright civil violence.</p></blockquote><p>No only do high
profile radicals &quot;function in a modern, plural society,&quot; they do so
with aplomb. Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden's chief of staff, was a
pediatric surgeon; the average madrasa student learns medicine from
Galen. Mohammed Atta was an architect; the average madrasa student
learns geometry from Euclid. (Did someone say something about a
stalking-horse?) Dalrymple's point, Madrasas are <em>not</em> breeding grounds for fundamentals and terrorists, the Haqqania and its ilk notwithstanding.&nbsp; They <em>are</em>
institutional bulwarks against radical textual interpretation, focusing
on &quot;the correct fulfillment of rituals, how to wash correctly before
prayers, and the proper length to grow a beard.&quot; To wit:</p><blockquote><p>[S]hortly
after September 11, bin Laden told a group of visiting Saudis that the
&quot;youths who conducted the operations did not accept any <em>fiqh</em> [school of Islamic law] in the popular term, but they accepted the <em>fiqh</em>
that the Prophet Muhammad brought.&quot; It is a telling quote: bin Laden
showing his impatience with legal training and the inherited structures
of Islamic authority. The hijackers, he implied, were taking effective
practical action rather than sitting around discussing legal texts. As
such he set himself up as a challenge to the madrasas and the <em>ulema</em>, bypassing traditional modes of religious study and looking directly to the Koran for guidance.</p></blockquote><p>Unlike
Omar Sheikh, the London School of Economics graduate who kidnapped
Daniel Pearl, the man who spends hours studying &quot;the proper length to
grow a beard&quot; will not think to question the Koranic code taught to him
at a madrasa. He will consider text and tradition inviolate elements of
a culture of faith, whereas the Englishman who comes to Islam late in
life will consider the text itself inviolate. Of course, the average
Englishman lives a kingly life compared to that of the impoverished
madrasa student. And with this I return to Melville and Deblanco and
ask:<br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><blockquote><p>Should we advocate the modernization of Islamic culture or should we support a return to traditionalism?</p></blockquote></span>A
century from now, the answer to this question will be obvious. It will
possess the same clarity which encourages condemnations of historical
figures for their &quot;patent&quot; moral or political &quot;lapses.&quot; But for the
life of me, I don't know what it is.</p>

		<span id="comment-11523335-content"><p>Understandable reluctance?  Do you mean that people at The Weblog would be particularly reluctant to comment because of the Christianity vs Islam thing?</p>

<p>Anyways, I don&#39;t think the particular examples you&#39;ve chosen are all that problematic.  You have three different discourses: moral, political (in terms of pragmatic politics), and aesthetic, which last is not really involved in your examples directly.  Each affects the other, but these are cases where you have to seperate them a bit to see what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>Morally, slavery needed to end.  In terms of practical politics, this would be likely to cause huge numbers of deaths, but this is a common occurance when a moral atrocity is allowed to go on for such a long time.  We&#39;re going to see a good number of U.S. deaths resulting from the current U.S. policy of torture, for instance, and that&#39;s nowhere near as longstanding or extensive or serious as slavery was.  So Melville being iffy about abolition was the usual case of avoiding a moral cause for fear of a pragmatically bad result.  It is a dilemma, but in a case in which change has to come eventually, waiting is not usually pragmatically the right choice in any case.</p>

<p>The second one appears fairly clear, for the same reasons.  Traditionalism has no chance in the long term, unless society goes back to the Dark Ages.  And it would be a moral crime to encourage a return to premodernity (even if we could) and leave all of the people in these societies in materially poor conditions just so there would be fewer capable terrorists.  More likely, there would be a modernizing fringe around any traditional society, no matter what.  So it&#39;s better to encourage societies to modernize both for moral reasons and practical political ones, even if it results in more terrorism in the short term.</p>

<p>Of course, if later on whales go extinct, then people may look back harshly on Delbanco even more than on Melville, figuring that Delbanco really should have known about this issue and brought it up in this context even if Melville didn&#39;t.  The difficult problems usually come when you don&#39;t really know how much information a figure in the past really had or could be expected to have had.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-11523711-content"><p>Happy Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>I had some trouble separating out who exactly you were glossing, the NYRB reviewer or Andrew Delbanco, when you wrote this: <br />
<i>This is not historicism for historicism&#39;s sake, according to Delbanco, but historicism in the service of moral and political complexity. Read in his original context, Melville should not be censured for his failure to condemn slavery because the experience of living in a tumultuous time includes &quot;both the yes and no of [a] culture.&quot;</i></p>

<p>So I don&#39;t know if the bit about &quot;read in his original context&quot; is yours or someone else&#39;s.  In any case I think reading a long-dead writer in his or her original context is utterly impossible, although we can and we should have a damn good try.  Sometimes the fullness and richness of the experience of feeling immersed in the past can make us imagine we have access to that past.  But don&#39;t you think that part of employing the &#39;historical imagination&#39; invoked up there is means acknowledging that it IS imaginary?    </p>

<p>I should say I&#39;ve already ordered the biography and am looking forward to reading it and probably learning a great deal from it.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-11525999-content"><p>This seems to me a very interesting problem (obviously more than ‘interesting’, since it’s tangling up our lives and all, but bear with me) in the shifting cultural logics of imperialism.  Looking forward to a reformed Islam in effect means looking forward to the triumph of the ideological empire of Western thought.  In effect it’s saying: “look here, you must change your religion and culture to accommodate the way <i>we</i> think about stuff; it’s <i>better</i>”, or “it’s <i>historically inevitable</i>” or whatever.  And that’s fine by me; I wouldn’t want my daughter growing up in Iran, or even Saudi Arabia.  But empires get  themselves expanded <i>differently</i> nowadays compared to the way they’ve always been done before, and that’s the problematic here I think.  </p>

<p>What what ‘we’ are saying to Johnny Islam is ‘hey! Don’t go on living in the medieval period!  Come on over here to the 21st-century!  It’s <i>so</i> much better, really it is.’  To which the Madrasa-student might very well retort: ‘no it isn’t.  You may have more material benefits than we do, but that’s not what makes human life <i>better</i> or <i>worthwhile</i>.  <i>That</i> only comes from a spiritual existence, something to which your hedonistic, materialist and decadent Western lifestyle is actively corrosive.</p>

<p><i>W-ner</i>.  Well, Western modernity isn’t all naked dancing girls and binges of drug-taking, you know.  It’s also advanced anti-cancer treatments, better nutrition, mobile phones, satellite TV channels.</p>

<p><i>E-ner</i>.  These are all facets of the same things: Western modernity privileges ‘quality of life’ over all else, but by quality of life it actually means <i>purely material comforts and indulgences</i>.  Without a clear moral compass, a spiritual dimension, and unless one live one’s life in consonance with the will of God, these things are worse than meaningless.  Western modernity is decadent in precisely the sense that swaddling the soul in the bubble-wrap of material advantage decays the moral principles that must underlie any fulfilled human existence.</p>

<p>But what interests me here is to think about this argument not under the logic of ‘morality’ or even ‘politics’, but as a symptom of a crisis in the long history of Western imperialism.  Because much of the radical Islamist objections to contemporary Western living are very precisely shared by radical Christians in the West: a similar fear of moral relativism, belief that the modern world is going to hell because of the population’s capitulation to the pleasure principle, homosexuality and promiscuity, all that.</p>

<p>But the point is that this forces putative imperialists into an historically unprecedented position.  When the Romans or the British expanded their empires they never doubted for a moment that <i>they</i> were the civilised ones, and that the people-to-be-subdued were just barbarians   But now the ideological forces behind the world’s major imperialist power <i>actually agree with the worldview of the imperialisees</i> in most salient respects (plus the Qu’ran is very complimentary about Jesus).  Plus of course there of course exists a sizeable portion of the population in the West who are ideologically <i>opposed</i> to the very idea of imperial expansion in the first place, and make a lot of fuss about e.g. torturing foreigners, burning them with <a href=" <a href=" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_phosphorous&quot;</a> target=&quot;new&quot;&gt; white phosphorous </a> and so on.  All this inevitably undermines the imperial project.  Difficult to conquer a third of the world when you’re heart’s really not in it.</p>

<p>Plenty of historians would argue that the end of the British Empire started with the <a href="“<a" href="“<a" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amritsar_Massacre”</a> target=“new”&gt; Amritsar massacre</a> in 1919.  Dyer was, as I understand it, really puzzled by the reaction he got for only doing what imperial commanders have done for thousands of years; if he’d been a Roman commander he might have crucified three hundred people in a long line to make his point.  What changed was not that the Indian people were outraged by the atrocity (of course they were) but that so many <i>British</i> were outraged.  It brought home the truth that imperialising is not just building railways and sending missionaries; it always inevitably involves killing, maiming and terrorising people.  When the willpower for maintaining imperial bleeds away, your days as an imperial oppressor are numbered.  Like Michael in the 3rd Godfather film, if you don’t have the stomach for it any more you’d better just sit in a chair in your garden and let younger thugs do the bloodletting.</p>

<p>My point is that the British reached that position after a century and a half of gaily slaughtering their way to an empire upon which the sun never set.  America seems to be at that point already, and you’ve hardly started.</p>

<p>The thing I can’t sort out in my head is the degree of rightness involved in this erosion of the imperial mindset.  Rich is pretty much right, I think, in his post.  Of course slavery is a monstrous moral wrong.  But once you get into the territory of asking, in effect, ‘how many lives is a worthwhile price to pay for ending slavery?  600,000?  Is that too many, or a fair price, given the evil that was undone by those deaths?’ then I don’t see how you can stop there.  How many lives would be worth paying to end something like <a href=" <a href=" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_phosphorous&quot;</a> target=&quot;new&quot;&gt; female genital mutilation </a>, which barbarity has been practised upon 130 million women alive today, and continues being practiced at the rate of 2 million a year (indeed my paper this morning says latest estimates are <i>3 million</i> a year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa)?  That’s not going to stop because UNICEF says ‘stop it’.  It’s a practice all bound up with deep cultural and, yes, religious roots.  Or to rephrase the question; if it takes Western cultural imperialism to blot out the practice, then is <i>that</i> a price worth paying?</p>

<p>I seem to have gone on and on.  Sorry about that.<br />

		<span id="comment-11527963-content"><p>Adam, I think that there&#39;s a big difference between encouraging societies to modernize and going in and conquering them with fire and sword.  As for imperialism, that&#39;s really what you don&#39;t get when a society becomes less of a colony and more independent, which can only happen with a certain degree of development.  If people think that modernity itself is a form of cultural imperialism, well too bad for them; I don&#39;t think there is any serious moral problem in defending McDonalds if the alternative involves defending female genital mutilation as a traditional practice.</p>

<p>And there are other important elements besides &quot;how many lives would you pay?&quot;  Slavery was, for the U.S., our own crime; no one was going to end it for us unless we did.  Therefore risking losing those lives in civil war was our own decision.  That&#39;s very different from looking around the globe and finding atrocities that other people are committing and deciding that we&#39;re going to make their choice for them that war is better.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-11530019-content"><p>To believe that effective intervention involves a benign &#39;encouraging societies to modernize&#39; seems a little underpowered to me.  What does &#39;modernize&#39; here really mean?  Surely it means precisely &#39;become more like Western capitalist democracies.&#39;  That involves a kind of violence for better or worse, and the name of this violence is imperialism.</p>

<p>The point of my comment (horribly overlong, sorry) was this thesis: the question about Western values taking precedence over traditional Near Eastern values, especially in a concrete on-the-ground sense, is actually this old question of <i>imperialism</i>.  My problem is that &#39;imperialism&#39; calls from me the automatic reaction of &#39;no!&#39;  But it may be more complex than that.  Naturally I don&#39;t want to see Western troops killing and desolating islamic countries.  But on the other hand, if I&#39;m honest, I <i>would</i> like to see women in Islamic states getting the same rights as the men; I&#39;d like to see a separation of church and state and so on -- Western values.  I don&#39;t want to see Western values <i>swamp</i> the area, of course; I&#39;m happy for local culture to remain intact, except in those places where it must give way to Western cultural values like equality of the sexes and so on (but this has always been the attitude of sensible imperialists: the British didn&#39;t want to see every Indian dressed in tweed suits and eating toad-in-the-hole.  Natives could wear what they liked and follow many of their traditional ways, <i>provided they accepted the primacy of a key set of Western values.</i>)  But I repudiate imperialism, I really do.  The hypocrisy is that I want to see the results of imperialism, but without any of the messy stuff.  I want the omelette, but I get upset when the eggs get broken.</p>

<p><i>I think that there&#39;s a big difference between encouraging societies to modernize and going in and conquering them with fire and sword.</i>  This seems to my Brit perspective a really really American thing to say.  The implication [this may have nothing to do with what Rich meant; but this is what it makes me think] &#39;hey <i>we&#39;re</i> not imperial aggressors; we&#39;re only using our white phosophorus and daisy cutters to encourage backward nations to modernize ...&#39;  It certainly seems to me less than convincing to say it&#39;s not imperialism unless we <i>actually</i> rename Iraq &#39;the US satrapy of Iraq&#39; and place Bush&#39;s eldest son on the throne.</p>

<p>President Bush goes on telly and says &#39;America does not torture people&#39;; but he&#39;s not going to change his mind just because people give him evidence that lots of American soldiers have indeed been doing just that.  What he means is &#39;never mind what individual Americans do: <i>America</i> doesn&#39;t torture people, that&#39;s not what America is about.  (America is about freedom &amp;c)&#39;.  Americans tend not to think of themselves as imperialists, perhaps, because &#39;empire&#39; is not what America is about.&#39;  The founding narrative of the republic is the resistance of imperialism and so on.  Of course, somebody at the sharp end of US military engagement might take a different view of the matter.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a similar slippage in Scott&#39;s original post, it seems to me: </p>

<p><i>Should we advocate the modernization of Islamic culture or should we support a return to traditionalism?</i></p>

<p>Advocate?  In the sense of saying &#39;By the way chaps, have you thought about modernizing?&#39; [which is to say: &#39;Should we advocate the modernization of Islamic culture and be ignored by the people concerned, or should we support a return to traditionalism and be equally ignored by the people concerned?&#39;].  Or is &#39;advocate&#39; meant in the sense that the British <i>advocated</i> for the Indian participation in the British Empire in the C19th century, or the sense in which the Romans advocated that the Jewish revolt of 67 AD really ought to stop?</p>

<p>The liberal equivocation is &#39;well, can we please stop all the oppression of women and the medieval barbarism and stuff without actually, you know, applying any, like, unpleasant pressure anywhere?  Not sending in troops and killing people, but, you know, doing a <i>little</i> more than just wringing our hands and wailing from the sidelines?&#39;  But I don&#39;t see what that middle way would look like.</p></span>

<p>You write &quot;What does &#39;modernize&#39; here really mean?&quot;  Well, continuing our example of Pakistan, it means things like being able to build your own nuclear weapons.  There&#39;s a kind of modernization that the U.S. decidedly did not want to see.  It means having your own economy, not one which is merely in a colonial relationship to the West (as opposed to relations to the global economy, which everyone is more or less involved in anyway).  It means having your own universities and intellectuals and culturally-influenced ideas, not those which are either an imitation of modernized areas or an unthinking reflection of traditional culture.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-11535487-content"><p>On one level, I think Adam&#39;s hand-wringing makes my point: if he ever comes down on one side or the other, he&#39;s likely to be condemned 100 years hence. If he doesn&#39;t, as Melville didn&#39;t on the issue of slavery, he&#39;ll be condemned for his failure to choose whichever side&#39;s proven correct 100 years hence.  To be frank: when I encounter such questions, I tend to construct charts with pros and cons for all involved parties and then count.  I have my principles, and like Adam, I&#39;d love to enforce them on the rest of the world.  Question is, do I equate those principles with some abstract idea of &quot;civilization,&quot; or am I just mouthing the categorical imperative?  I know the latter to be true, but am unsure about the former, for the reasons Adam&#39;s Islamic interlocutor up there listed.  I want to address some of the issues Rich and Adam have fronted, and I will when I&#39;m not so pressed for time.  (End of quarter.  Papers need grading.  Thick-readings of the cultural context of ethical conflicts quite time-consuming.)</p>

<p><i>So I don&#39;t know if the bit about &quot;read in his original context&quot; is yours or someone else&#39;s. In any case I think reading a long-dead writer in his or her original context is utterly impossible, although we can and we should have a damn good try. Sometimes the fullness and richness of the experience of feeling immersed in the past can make us imagine we have access to that past. But don&#39;t you think that part of employing the &#39;historical imagination&#39; invoked up there is means acknowledging that it IS imaginary?</i></p>

<p>Laura, that&#39;s Delbanco, but it&#39;s a point I agree with, as I do with yours.  I think the work involved in understanding a novel or poem or play in its original context mind-bogglingly difficult and time-consuming, but also far more valuable, productive of actual knowledge about the stakes of interpretation in the text instead of meta-knowledge about the things this novel/poem/play made me, the critic, think about.  The parallel I&#39;ve drawn should encourage us to sympathize with authors who lived in a world as complex as ours; instead, criticism is over-run with the easy condemnation of authors culturally incapable of thinking their way through to our beknighted opinions.  Presentism, yes, but more pernicious because structural at this point.  </p>

<p>Alright, both responses feel like that moment in class when I realize that I&#39;d asked a question I can&#39;t answer comfortably myself.  More grading, then more thinking, then more commenting.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-11556128-content"><p><i>I think that you really didn&#39;t read my last comment very well if you think that Bushian &quot;we&#39;re invading them for their own good&quot; policies are what I was talking about.</i></p>

<p>Well, Rich, I really do apologise if in my blather I gave the impression I was bracketing you with Bush there.</p>

<p><i>Adam, when people say that they&#39;d like to encourage other societies to modernize, they don&#39;t mean military intervention, however justified.</i></p>

<p>But there&#39;s a reason why we&#39;re talking here about US and European, but particularly US, values governing the format of &#39;modernization&#39; and it&#39;s not that the US is just, like, really persuasive with words and stuff.  It&#39;s Force and the glamour of Force.  I mean, I don&#39;t want to give the impression that I hold a sneery teenage belief in <i>machtpolitik</i> as the be-all and end-all, but what is it makes the US the world&#39;s 800-lb gorilla, rather than a country of similar size and population like, say, India?  There are other State Apparatuses that apply pressure and compel, apart (I mean) from the Military State Apparatus.</p>

<p>Or to be specific, with the examples you mention. I&#39;d really be tempted to gloss your Pakistan passage thuswise:</p>

<p>&quot;It means things like being able to build your own nuclear weapons <i> based on technology from the West, and a desire to emulate Western military models and philosophy</i> ... It means having your own economy <i>provided it adheres closely to the model of Western capitalist free-enterprise which the US favours [let&#39;s not include, say, Cuba in this list of glorious modernizations]</i> ... It means having your own universities <i> provided they follow in the tradition not of the native Madrasas Scott&#39;s post talks about, but the Western Heidelberg, Oxford and MIT model.</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Of course you specifically say not this latter ... <i>not those which are either an imitation of modernized areas or an unthinking reflection of traditional culture</i> which is fair enough, or a point to argue at least; but I&#39;d still say that the very cultural privileging of &#39;thinking&#39;, or the stigmatising of a culture that values &#39;unthinking&#39; obedience; the privileging of novelty, or progress, over tradition: the insistence that what is wanted is structures that produce freethinkers; all that is the imposition of Western values where they may very well not apply.</p>

<p>I read an article somewhere in which Islamic scholars and Western film studies dudes talked about Disney&#39;s <i>Aladdin</i>; and the Islamists said the thing they found most puzzling was the way Robin Williams&#39; genie makes such a fetish about being <i>free</i>.  That&#39;s not in the Arabian Nights, and not something that makes much sense to Islamic worldview.  This point had simply not occurred to the US critics even as an issue; they took it for granted that of course we all want to be free.  Live free or die, surely?</p>

<p>Scott: handwringing, yes.  Very much so.  That&#39;s not good, though: sitting on the fence.  Because ye are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold I shall spew you out of my belly.  And similar quotations emphasising the despicability of it all.  Can there be such a thing as genuine, considered handwringing?</p></span>

<p>I think there can be, and I think that&#39;s my point.  We don&#39;t know what the superior answer is; but we will be condemned by posterity for not knowing.  We will be no better than the poor seventeenth century novelist not forward-looking enough to be a proto-feminist.  I suppose what I want to clarify here are the parameters of legitimate future condemnation.  Say I oppose the War in Iraq now, but it turns out the neoconservatives were correct.  One hundred years from now, because Bush stuck to the course blah blah blah, Iraq became the first domino to fall in what led to the creation of a democraticized, Westernized Middle East.  Middle Eastern culture, at that time, still suffers from bouts of Islamic fundamentalism, but they&#39;re more like <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=2&url=http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Robert_Rudolph" rel="nofollow">Eric Rudolph</a> and less like bin Laden.  What would the scholars of this society think of anti-war left?  Would they write dystopian novels about a future in which America had pulled out, the fundamentalists won and built <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0785115609" rel="nofollow"><i>Sentinals</i></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1" alt="">?  To return to Melville, what if the Civil War had lasted for decades with no side winning any decisive victory, the American economy buckled under the strain, the British returned, and instead of <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/lj20/2005/11/calm_down_calm_.html" rel="nofollow">yesterday&#39;s feast</a> I had eaten my 1,432,019th bowl of blood pudding?  In other words, I think scholars have a blinder-than-already-suspected blind-spot when it comes to assessing the complexity of historical cost/benefits analyses.  They don&#39;t understand that handwringing isn&#39;t fence-sitting; that, for example, they would feel no compunctions about declaring the Civil War a defendable military adventure because, despite the loss of life, the ends justified the means; they would not feel the same about the current conflict in Iraq because the means are unacceptable when the ends are yet unknown.  This doesn&#39;t mean that I support the war, only that I know why I&#39;ll be condemned by future scholars if the democratic domino theory proves correct.  </p>

<p>Delbanco&#39;s accomplishments, according to Crews, include communicating the complexity of the situation which necessitated such a grim cost/benefits analysis.  I would hope future scholars would show us the same courtesy.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-11560306-content"><p>Adam, I&#39;m sorry for deflecting this thread off into a tangent to some extent, but it really isn&#39;t just a Western fetish for &quot;free thinking&quot; that makes it important.  Societies are in military, economic, and cultural competition, or at least some are (in the limiting case, you really need only one aggressive one).  If a society can&#39;t produce its own scientists, engineers, businesspeople, poets (or equivalent), and so on, that society will eventually be absorbed by some other one.  The reason that Pakistan wanted nuclear weapons was not because of a &quot;desire to emulate Western military models and philosophy&quot;, it was because they shared a border with a country that they were in actual conflict with, and they observed that nuclear weapons are very effective as deterrents, i.e. they really are whether that&#39;s the Western military model for their use or not.  &quot;Having your own economy&quot; most definitely includes Cuba: socialism and socialist development is modern, not traditional.  The &quot;native Madrasas Scott&#39;s post talks about&quot; are in their current form cultural expansions of Saudi Arabia into Pakistan, not really native, so they are at least no better than the Western university considered as a cultural entity.</p>

<p>Basically, what I think is the matter with your post is that it seems to assume that everything is *purely* ideological.  Technological advances (nuclear weapons, high-productivity manufacturing, global forms of mass media) permit some societies to dominate others in certain predictable ways.  If the price of mastering those technological advances is a certain amount of &quot;free thought&quot; (and let&#39;s not even start on how free it really is), then societies must permit a certain amount of it in order to continue.  That&#39;s really what modernization means.</p></span>

<p>Rich: you put it very well, and it don&#39;t think it deflects the thread.  I agree with you that Pakistan&#39;s border with India, and conflict thereby, is the proximate cause of eg nuclear arms-racing; but there are deeper causes that go back to the ending of, and before that the ideological logic of, British imperial rule in the area.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, I suppose I do think everything is determined by ideology; but that doesn&#39;t seem to me to be a narrow belief.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-11591518-content"><p>Well, according to a source of regional repute, &quot;black pudding&quot; is &quot;synonymous&quot; with &quot;blood pudding&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Black pudding is a sausage...made from pig&#39;s blood with some thickening agent, such as cereal, and spices. Its name--a reference to the darkened colour of the cooked blood--is of long standing...The synonymous blood pudding is equally ancient, but nowadays much less usual. In England, the Midlands and the North are the great areas of black pudding appreciation; Bury in Lancashire is often claimed as the black pudding capital. But black puddings form an essential part of the basic peasant cuisine of many other European countries...Elsewhere in Europe a black pudding is a blutwurst (Germany) or a kashanka (Poland).&quot;

<p>---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), 31</blockquote></p>

<p>So there!</p>

<p>Actually, this is what I&#39;m arguing against; I suppose my championing of Delbanco&#39;s &quot;history was very complex, see&quot; account of Melville isn&#39;t coming through.  My complaint about much modern scholarship is that it suffers from a particularly self-righteous form of presentism, one which I don&#39;t believe it has the right too, esp. since we don&#39;t know how the future will judge commitments to or opposition of contemporary events like the War in Iraq.  We do tend to make the most informed, morally sound decision we can . . . unfortunately, the same cannot be said of our policy-makers.  I think we pretty much agree here.  </p></span>

It came in plam-sized chnky circles, very black, which we fried and ate.  It was fairly horrible, but, you know: meat.  Cheap.  See above.  I&#39;ve lived, or stayed, in various places in the UK, but only in Scotland have I come across black pudding as a major stock item in supermarkets (rather than a speciality item in butchers), implying than many people eat it regularly.  But these are only my personal memories, which have been neither edited by John Ayto nor published by Oxford University Press; and I know which source I&#39;d trust, if I were you.  I concede the point.</p>

<p>I feel I&#39;m in unconscious competition with Rich here: for he said <i>I&#39;m sorry for deflecting this thread off into a tangent to some extent</i> and then developed a cogent and perfectly relevant argument; where I seem to have moved the thread into non-hallal black-pudding-related chatter, as if to say <i>deflecting this thread off into a tangent?  <b>I&#39;ll</b> show you deflecting this thread off into a tangent!</i></p></span>

Way more smart than you or I. How do I know that? They challenge stupid people like you and I to reveal our GRE scores so they can tell us how much higher theirs was. (Even though they admit elsewhere that they only have &quot;decent GREs.&quot;) Or they challenge us to play chess because they are better than Garry Kasparov even though they sound more like Bobby Fischer. They demand you do your math but then admit that they don't know that much about math. But they can do it anyway because they are so smart. They write in elegant shorthand like T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound and millions of functionally illiterate AOL subscribers. Only Trolls have brains so big they combine their awesome shorthand with &quot;deep thoughts&quot; about &quot;important stuff.&quot; It doesn't matter if Trolls say &quot;yr&quot; or &quot;bidness.&quot; They are not middle age wannabe Beats with drinking problems. They know what Modus Ponens is and you do not because they are smart and you are not. They post profound pictures instead of using words because their words would explode your stupid mind. (You should thank them for their kindness. It comes from years of reading Russell and other analytic philosophers you are too stupid to understand. Only geniuses would recycle the same manipulated images in every forum they entered because that is the best way to let people know how smart you are.) But what makes them super-geniuses is that when they say something really smart they preserve their brilliance in Google's prodigious cache. I copied a sentence from a comment The Homofascist Feminist Regime deleted and paste it into Google and see what I found! The same brilliant sentiment repeated in another context entirely. That's one thought I won't have to think but should remember because it is so smart. Look what else I found! The whole paragraph from which the earlier sentence was excerpted! Trolls love us so much they saturate the internet with their brilliance so Google is sure to catalog it. But that's not all! Trolls love to threaten other people with the same threat because it is super-effectively-threatening and they know that because they take hard classes in statistics. But they don't have to work very hard in them to succeed, and not just because they can't: &quot;Sloth is one of my character faults, and the last few years I have been sucked deep into the soothing vortex of the Internet.&quot; Trolls only &quot;suck deep&quot; and &quot;vent narcissitically&quot; because they need more stuff to power their mega-minds and the more stuff they take in the more stuff they have to vent out. (Especially now that they are getting older.) So the reason Trolls are more awesome than you is that they are middle-aged drunks who repeat themselves and are not good at math and did not do good on their GREs and suck deep because they are sloths. Or maybe they are not awesome and the comments deleted...</span></a></div>
