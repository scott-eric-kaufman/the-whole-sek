        <meta name="description" content="Sometimes the historical record tells us nothing about what happened. Case in point: the &quot;panic&quot; incited by Orson Welle's 1938 radio play of War of the Worlds. Some claim that the panic is an institutional artifact, the result of Hadley Cantril's attempt to legitimize social psychology. That claim's misleading, however, as Cantril's 1940 study--The Invasion from Mars: a Study in the Psychology of Panic--was written under the aegis of the already extant Princeton Radio Project. The PRP, funded by a Rockefeller grant which may have been a series of laundered CIA disbursements, opened its doors in 1937 and many of its members--apparently everyone except Adorno--became ranking officials in the intelligence community after America entered WWII. So the odds of Cantril perpetuating the &quot;panic myth&quot; to establish social psychology as a science are slim. Why would someone with access to the halls of power need to establish his credentials? Nevermind. My mind swarms with visions of Creationists and ID proponents lobbying the administration for intellectual responsibility. But that's fundamentalists demanding the scientific community recognize the legitimacy of their &quot;science&quot; through political channels. They're lobbying the administration; Cantril and his fellow PRP'ers were sought out by the government because of the accepted legitimacy of their work.

Adient motives influence people to believe with little evidence or logic what would normally be rejected as erroneous by common sense.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
			<p>Sometimes the historical record tells us nothing about what happened.&nbsp; Case in point: the &quot;panic&quot; incited by Orson Welle's 1938 radio play of <em>War of the Worlds</em>.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/nether_fictoid7.htm">Some</a> claim that the panic is an institutional artifact, the result of Hadley Cantril's attempt to legitimize social psychology.&nbsp; That claim's misleading, however, as Cantril's 1940 study--<em>The Invasion from Mars: a Study in the Psychology of Panic</em>--was written under the aegis of the already extant Princeton Radio Project.&nbsp; The PRP, funded by a Rockefeller grant <a href="http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/oss/foundingfathers.htm">which may have been a series of laundered CIA disbursements</a>, opened its doors in 1937 and many of its members--apparently everyone except <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=10&amp;q=http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Adorno.html&amp;e=9888">Adorno</a>--became ranking officials in the intelligence community after America entered WWII.</p>

<p>So the odds of Cantril perpetuating the &quot;panic myth&quot; to establish social psychology as a science are slim.&nbsp; Why would someone with access to the halls of power need to establish his credentials?&nbsp; Nevermind.&nbsp; </p>

<p>My mind swarms with visions of Creationists and ID proponents lobbying the administration for intellectual responsibility.&nbsp; But that's fundamentalists demanding the scientific community recognize the legitimacy of their &quot;science&quot; through political channels.&nbsp; They're lobbying the administration; Cantril and his fellow PRP'ers were sought out by the government because of the accepted legitimacy of their work.&nbsp; If Cantril has nothing to gain professionally by disseminating the &quot;panic myth&quot;--<em>i.e. </em>if it's not invented whole-cloth--then we're left to debate the degree of &quot;panic&quot; involved.&nbsp; Here's what we know:</p>

<ol><li>people didn't jump off buildings</li>

<li>people didn't stand armed on front porches</li>

<li>people did overwhelm the telephone circuits</li>

<li>people did try to verify the truth of the claims (esp. in New Jersey)</li>

<li>people did believe that the nation's response to the program had been widespread panic</li></ol>

<p>What this means isn't that the &quot;panic&quot; didn't occur, only that it fell somewhere between someone actually yelling &quot;FIRE!&quot; in a crowded theater (400 victims hoaxed) and the latest outbreak of mad-cow disease (all beef-eating Americans).&nbsp; What all three situations do point to is the power of adient motives.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Adient motives influence people to believe with little evidence or logic what would normally be rejected as erroneous by common sense.&nbsp; The adient factors involved in the &quot;panic&quot; Welles caused would be, naturally, the general culture of unbelievability cultivated by the news filtering in from Europe.&nbsp; As Rabbi Jonah B. Wise, of the Central Synagogue on 652 Lexington Avenue, said in his sermon the week after the &quot;panic&quot;:</p><blockquote><p>Hitler has made a Frankenstein of himself and of Germany.&nbsp; Last Sunday night people in the whole of the United States were running away in panic fear from Adolph Hitler.</p></blockquote><p>His counterpart at the Congregation Rodeph Sholom of 7 West Eighty-third Street, Rabbi Louis I. Newman, concurred:</p><blockquote><p>The gullibility which masses of people showed concerning the radio broadcast gives a clear indication of the reasons why myths regarding races and religions are so easily believed.</p></blockquote><p>What this means is that, in the end, both the panic and dissemination of the &quot;panic myth&quot; is all Hitler's fault.&nbsp; It's directly his fault because the outlandishness of the news from Europe primed people to believe anything they heard on the radio; it's indirectly his fault because Jewish leaders jumped on the &quot;panic myth&quot; in order to convince the American people of the even more outlandish events that were being reported, albeit piecemeal, but weren't being believed.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And because the Communications Commision (apparently not yet Federal) banned the use of &quot;flash&quot; and &quot;bulletin&quot; in all non-hard-news radio programs, we can also blame Hitler for the <em>Flesh Gordon</em> Riots of '40 and '41.&nbsp; </p>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/damned_by_an_ac.html"><span><strong>Damned by an Accurate, Honest Summary?</strong> A couple of months back, I outlined the argument of Donald Pease's &quot;Psychoanalyzing the Narrative Logics of Naturalism.&quot; Scratch that: I tried and failed to outline his argument. Donna Campbell--author of the &quot;Fiction: 1900 to the 1930s&quot; section of the most recent American Literary Scholarship--summarizes Pease's argument as follows: [It] refutes previous criticism by taking issue with Mark Seltzer’s idea that narrative control is restored at the end of The Call of the Wild. ‘‘Buck’’ appears first as a signifier of the Judge’s property and then as ‘‘the agent’’ of the panoptic ‘‘free indirect discourse’’ through which Buck’s thoughts are narrated, but he still escapes ‘‘the normative control of the disciplinary society’’ through his communication with Thornton. Buck’s dreams, which reproduce authentic free indirect discourse, and the instantaneous, extrarational impulses through which Buck and Thornton communicate escape the narrative’s foreclosure of ‘‘the disciplinary society’s foundational violence’’ in those passages in which the ‘‘libidinal intensities’’ of Buck’s are set in motion. Her summary, curiously devoid of affect or judgment, strikes me as criticism by paraphrase. It's as if she's reluctant to criticize a major figure in the field and has decided instead to let his argument sink on its own merits. Her direct quotations almost insinuate that the argument works despite the thickets of jargon; then again, maybe it fails on account of its reliance on jargon. To be frank, I can't tell what Campbell thinks of the argument. And I believe that ambiguity might, itself, be damning.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/we_age_so_quick.html"><span><strong>We Age So Quickly Now...</strong> That I can only categorize this as &quot;From the Archives&quot; makes my point more forcefully than I ever could, but I still feel compelled to quote this statement from the Onion's interview with the newly reformed Dinosaur Jr. on the eve of their tour: Nearly sixteen years after Barlow was given the boot... What!?! Bands I listened to have been broken up for almost 15 years!?! But, but, but, these bands were awesome. My bands weren't like the crap bands all those older-than-dirt folks blather on and on and on about. My bands were awesome, I tell you, awesome. I suppose this isn't the best time to mention that while under the thrall of insomnia I watched unfold on the television the most accomplished cover of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; ever recorded. But I will anyway. That the Foo Fighters were the ones performing is beside the point. (I believe I can manage to alienate all members of my audience who aren't my immediate contemporaries in a single post. If you're three months older or younger than me, you no doubt have no idea what I'm talking about. But that's only because I'm infinitely cooler than you. I have the indie cred you bartered for and failed to land. I possess the banter you so pathetically imitate. That's right children: I'm the King of All Things Trivial, a latter-day Peter Pumpkinhead, if you will. Hooray for me!)</span></a></div>
