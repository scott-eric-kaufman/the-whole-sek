My husband and I went on our coffee date this morning about 6:00 a.m. We came home and we both did a little blogging and Mike did some chatting while I did some laundry and sat down with my cookbooks. I came up with a menu that would last us until nearly the end of the month (minus the holiday trimmings). I then sorted through our pantry and fridge to see what was there and started writing out our grocery list. For the first time ever, I took the grocery list and sorted it by aisle ... I couldn't find the post he quoted—a polite competitor would've included a link—nor do I remember a 6 a.m. coffee date with a man named Mike (or doing his laundry) (or reading his cookbooks) (or coming up with menus) (or sorting through my pantry), but I like this idea I had about sorting the grocery list by aisle. Do you know how many calories I waste traipsing back to aisles I've already covered? The last time I went to the supermarket, I double-backed to the cereal aisle no less than fifteen times. That's almost 10,000 calories I could've used folding Mike's laundry! (Why put the coffee with the cereal? Just because they're both breakfast foods? Because they're not. People drink coffee all day. I'm drinking coffee right now. I ground the beans myself this morning. They say there's no coffee like freshly ground coffee, and let me tell you: they are correct. This is the best cup of coffee I've had since yesterday afternoon, when I snuck a little Kona into my normal blend. Kona's been my favorite coffee for a long time because it reminds me of Hawaii. Not that I've been to Hawaii, but I've always dreamed of going, and I imagine when I get there it will smell like Kona. So despite the chill that settled over Southern California yesterday, I drank coffee that reminds me of what I've long thought Hawaii will smell like. It was a wonderful day.) I'm glad I had the idea to sort the grocery list by aisle. I only wish I'd remembered having that idea, that way I wouldn't have wasted all the calories I've wasted since I forgot I had it. But enough about me. Chuck asked: Wait, I am in the running with this? Am I this dull? The answer to the first question should be self-evident. As to the second: does it get any more exciting than this? I'm forced to conclude, Chuck, that you are that dull. Then there's this &quot;Jack's Shack&quot; Jew, who complains about how little smack talk is flying. This Jew's about as Jewish as they come. His blog roll consists entirely of Jew blogs: Israel this, Rabbi that, What-to-do-with-the-Blood-of-Christian-Children the other.

This is funny until the link to Chuck, which isn&#39;t funny, and the &quot;the jew&quot; thing is weird without context. But the post prior to that is still enough to win you my vote (and really you should probly send Chuck a bill cuz his post about you was genuinely funny - you made him write a better post). Oh yeah, please give my love to Mike.<br />

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/11/homicide.html"><span><strong>The Munch Paradox</strong> Frequent commenter Todd. and I spent Saturday afternoon watching [redacted for Todd.'s peace of mind]. The conversation turned to David Simon's Homicide: Life on the Streets, then to the storied history one of Baltimore's (fictional) finest: John Munch. Munch, played by comedian Richard Belzer, will make television history when he appears on an episode of Simon's current show, The Wire , as it will mark the tenth separate program in which he has appeared as a character. In addition to being a principle on Homicide and Law &amp; Order: SVU, Munch has appeared on: Law &amp; Order Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury The Simpsons Arrested Development The Beat The X-Files Sesame Street What is it about Munch that people find so compelling? The conspiracy theories? The serial monogamy? The counter-culture radical turned cop? Whatever the reason, the ubiquity of Munch obscures an important fact: namely, that Simon's Homicide is an adaptation of his book of a similar name and that he based Munch on an actual murder police named Jay Landsman. I've taught Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets before, so I'm familiar with Landsman, of the sidelong smile and pockmarked face, who tells the mothers of wanted men that all the commotion is nothing to be upset about, just a routine murder warrant. Landsman, who leaves empty liquor bottles in the other sergeants' desks and never fails to turn out the men's room light when a ranking officer is indisposed. Landsman, who rides a headquarters elevator the police commissioner and leaves complaining that some sonofabitch stole his wallet. Jay Landsman, who as a Southwestern patrolman parked his radio car at Edmondson and Hilton, then used a Quaker Oatmeal box covered in aluminum fol as a radar gun. The pockmarked face and sneering at authority is vintage Munch. The drinking and fake radar guns? Reminds me more of this detective from The Wire. His name? Jay Landsman. He looks like this: Who looks nothing like this: And even less like this: Who is that? Why, that would be a retired Baltimore murder police by the name of Jay Landsman, playing a character named Dennis Mello on The Wire. The mind boggles. For those of you keeping score, it's possible that an upcoming episode of The Wire might now incorporate: John Munch, a character inspired by Jay Landsman Jay Landsman, a second character inspired by Jay Landsman the real Jay Landsman I should be able to draw some sort of conclusion from this, but honestly, the situation seems unprecedented. Have there ever been two fictionalized versions of the same guy and the guy himself running around the same television show? There must be a meta-meta-meta-point to be drawn from this—something more sophisticated than &quot;David Simon, he loves him some Landsman&quot;—but I'm at a loss for what it might be.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/11/milestones-mile.html"><span><strong>Milestones, Milestones, Milestones, Part I</strong> The next week will witness Acephalous reach two milestones: my 1,500th post and my 500,000th visitor. But one milestone's already been achieved: namely, my 10,000th comment. To celebrate my 10,000th comment, I'm reprinting my first. It was written by &quot;Some Gay Guy&quot; and reads thus: Barrett argues that Rodman intrigues the public because he draws attention to himself &quot;not only on the basketball court but at the site of sexual energy itself with its perilous crush of racial, gendered, domestic, and commercial prohibitions and imperatives.&quot; Since when is Newport Beach a &quot;site of sexual energy&quot;? Incidentally, let me say as a fag that I do indeed feel guilty every time I have casual fag sex. Like all men, I am a rutting, filthy swine, mired in what I know to be moral squalor and yet pathetically unable to control my vile appetites, and I demand acknowledgment as such! Do you think that's publishable? I'm feeling some heat from my advisor ... My second comment's also worth a read.</span></a></div>
