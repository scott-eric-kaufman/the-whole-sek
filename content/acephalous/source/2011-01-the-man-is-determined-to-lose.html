In “Obama Does Best When He Says Nothing,” Cashill compares the President to “Chauncey Gardiner, [who] is the protagonist of Jerzy Kosinski’s 1971 prescient satire, Being There, which was later made into a movie of the same name, co-scripted by Kosinski.” Because his ethos, such as it is, relies so heavily on the impression that he is a man of letters, he neglects to inform the reader that the quotations he draws from Kosinski’s “prescient satire” are not, in fact, in the novel. They are, however, in the film. As I am the last person about to denigrate film as a medium, my point here is not to belittle Cashill for quoting from a film, but simply to note that, like most disreputable literary critics, he believes his credibility relies on always being the first to “lose” a game of Humiliation.* *From David Lodge’s Changing Places: He taught them a game he had invented as a postgraduate student, in which each person had to think of a well-known book he hadn’t read, and scored a point for every person present who had read it.

I think what Karl is thinking of is the Malvolio-esque (and male) American professor, Ringbaum, who in <i>Changing Places</i> is driven by his desperate need to win to admit to never having read <i>Hamlet</i>. Then, he&#39;s denied tenure because the committee feels they can&#39;t in good conscience give tenure to someone who&#39;s never read <i>Hamlet</i>, and he&#39;s still smarting about this in <i>Small World</i>. I don&#39;t think Philip Swallow ever loses his job--in <i>Nice Work</i> he&#39;s still at Rummidge, as chair. </p></span>

If students dig jokes about academic conferences, departmental meetings, fights with the provost and dean, &amp;c., then more power to them, but I think these are jokes that primarily appeal to me and my ilk, god help us.</p>

It was on comedy, but after Aristophanes, Plautus, Juvenal, Shakespeare, and Moliere, our reading list got very strange. No Swift, no Wilde, no, I don&#39;t know, Louis Carroll or H.L. Mencken—we read <i>The Red and the Black</i>, and then <i>Lucky Jim</i>, <i>Nice Work</i>, Philip Roth&#39;s <i>The Counterlife</i> (hardly the funniest Roth book), Stoppard&#39;s <i>Arcadia</i>, and we watched <i>Animal House</i>. That&#39;s right--three works on campus life. It was most odd.</p></span>

The reason why we need a special phrase like “blood libel” to denote lies told about what Jews do with the blood of baby Christians is the sheer number of libels which Jews have had to contend over the years. He gets to the &quot;ass libel&quot; and the &quot;leper libel&quot; soon enough. (No, neither of us is kidding.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/who-taught-you-how-to-mourn.html"><span><strong>Who taught you how to mourn?</strong> The conservative reaction to Thursday’s memorial service betrays both their myopia and desperation. From the opening prayer—some “Indian tribal thing” according to Powerline’s Paul Mirengoff—to the ubiquitous complaints about the audience’s reaction to a speech that even The Corner awarded the highest possible mark, the implication is that there is but a single proper way to celebrate a life and that any deviation from said way diminishes those being memorialized. The problem with that argument is that it’s false on its face. Were I to die an Irish cop my life might be celebrated with drink and song. If I were Ronnie James Dio, my life might be punctuated by heavy metal. If I were Jim Henson, I would go to my grave to the sound of singing puppets. Plainly put, if you criticize the way someone runs a memorial service because it differs from how you would, you reveal more about yourself than you might think. For example, you reveal that you have likely never been close enough to someone of a different religion, race or class to attend a service for or with them. I can only imagine what critics of the memorial might do if they attended a Jewish one: “Why are these people screaming and ripping off their clothes? Why is everyone pinning shreds of ripped cloth to their suits? Who organized all these pins?” If you actually have been close enough to someone of a different religion, race or class to attend a service for or with them and are still criticizing this execution of this one, you reveal the emptiness of your criticisms and the baseness of your convictions. By attempting to whip into a frenzy those who have never attended a service outside their ilk, you demonstrate that you care more for the success of your political compatriots than you do those being mourned. But if a large part of your constituency consists of people who attend mega-churches and you complain about this: You reveal yourself as a member of the Church of SASQUATCH ISREAL and will never be able to refudiate those who rightfully mock you.</span></a></div>
