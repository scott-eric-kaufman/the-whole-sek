Since you will be alone on Christmas, I spoke to Santa and he is going to try very, very hard to reroute your presents to your home. He is also including some cookies!! If not received on the 25th, he will drop it off on the 26th.  <br />
P.S. I am really sorry about Rachel and I know it is strange to pray for a cat, but I sent a message to God and I hope he will help you at this time.  We are going to miss you here, but I understand how important Rachel is to you.  Love to you.</p></span>

<p>The Universe seems to have a very tragicomic (or is it comitragic?) approach to you.  The only plus side to this that I can see, is that it will make very good reading as part of your forth-coming memoir, <i>You Make Me Completely Uncomfortable with Your Words: Disadventures of a Graduate Student</i>.</p>

<p>Best Birthday, Christmas, New Year and Recovery wishes to you and your kitty.</p></span>

Last night the neighbors broke up. Their marriage is officially over. The husband has had it up to here with her sloth. Does she know that's a cardinal's sin? The wife can't believe she's stayed with him this long because speaking of cardinal's sins, what about those receipts from his last two business trips? She means what the fuck. She means isn't adultery a cardinal's sin? He only gets manicures on business trips because the Japanese reward attention to detail. He doesn't know what she's talking about. How would she know how much a manicure costs in Seattle? She hasn't left her sty in years. Except it's not her sty. It's their sty and it's not like he can't wash a plate or not throw dirty underwear on the floor. Did he think he was marrying a maid? No he didn't. He was marrying a wife and he can't understand why she can't understand that. She can't understand why he can't understand why she thinks that's sexist. Now she's a feminist. He always knew. He should've known what with her book club and shit. Fuck is he ever retarded. Fuck if he doesn't know why he didn't ditch her to the curb the night he came home and she was reading Oprah. Me? I was trying to watch Once but had to listen to this. Goes without saying the mood was choked. * Before Young Wolfson reprimands me, &quot;I'm seriously&quot; is a phrase bandied about this here household. Don't know why. It just is. I'm seriously.</span></a></div>

I'll miss the talks, the panels, the blogger meet-up, the other blogger meet-up—but if I'd flown to Chicago I would've spent every talk, panel and meet-up with my head in Irvine, and I would've missed something even more important than my career. I won't bore you with the details—not that I think you lack sympathy, I'm just not much in the mood to re-live the last three days. Needless to say, blogging will be light for the foreseeable future.</span></a></div>
