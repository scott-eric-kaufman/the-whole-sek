It has been drizzling for a little under an hour. The streets become rivers. Tiny coastal towns are buried beneath fifteen tons of mud. On the sidewalks the water is four inches deep. Pedestrians try to find the shallowest puddles and invariably fail. The few who succeed are immediately drenched by the wake of a passing automobile. God hates the self-satisfied. A man in a spiffy tweed coat sloshes through the results of this civil engineering disaster. On his face is a look of determination. He has a lecture to attend come Hell or high water . . . but he hopes it doesn't come to Hell. The man in the snappy tweed jacket arrives at his destination. He is wet and cold and tired. He finds a seat next to a few friends and prepares to hear a lecture about his advisor's advisor's new book from a renowned scholar. RENOWNED SCHOLAR: I believe [the Tweedy Fellow's advisor's advisor] says X. TWEEDY FELLOW: (to himself) No he doesn't! He says nothing of the sort. He's a Y man! What's all this about X? RENOWNED SCHOLAR: [The Tweedy Fellow's advisor's advisor] is heavily invested in X. Without it his argument is worthless. But with it (pause for effect) it is also worthless. Therefore he is worthless! TWEEDY FELLOW: (to himself) This guy's charming and funny but he doesn't get it. He thinks [my advisor's advisor] says X. Why would he think X? Why would anyone? Time passes, er, the Tweedy Fellow passes the time by re-re-re-re-reading a .pdf of his advisor's advisor's book to make sure he hasn't missed something. He hasn't. RENOWNED SCHOLAR: In closing I hope everyone can see that [the Tweedy Fellow's advisor's advisor] is worth reading as an intellectual exercise . . . but not seriously. Thank you. You've been great! I'll be here all week. TWEEDY FELLOW: (to himself after observing his advisor's neck color-shift into angry Irish reds) My work here is done. To the place where food and beverages are provided in exchange for legal tender!</span></a></div>

In Louisiana?!?  Never!</strong> Woodlawn High School (circa 1993) in front of Building C. A gap runs through the center of the brick structure. The school is built on an active fault. Service projects include &quot;shave bricks to fix new gaps in walls&quot; and &quot;repair water damage in classrooms caused by newer ones.&quot; Scott, Justin, Jason and Craig sit in a circle during lunch. They appear to be having an animated discussion. (Probably about boobs.) Trey walks up. He is followed by a passel of fine upstanding citizens led by a man-child named Michael. As Trey approaches the circle, everyone turns to greet him. Scott: Yo. Justin: Yo. Jason: Yo. Craig: Yo. Trey: Yo. Scott: What's their problem? Trey: Them? (He points to the fine upstanding citizens behind him.) They want to kick my ass. Justin: Why? Trey: Don't know. Do you think I should ask? Scott: (without a hint of sarcasm) Why do you want to kick Trey's ass? Michael: You know him? (He points at Trey.) 'Cause we're gonna kick his ass. Scott: Why? Michael: What's it to you? Scott: I kind of like the little fellow. He stole a pizza for us once. Michael: I can kick your ass too. Scott: Why? Michael: For that fucker. (He points at Trey. His pacing becomes more frantic. The attention spans of his posse begin to flag.) I'm gonna kick his ass. At this point Michael's posse becomes restless. Shouts of &quot;Kick his ass!&quot; and &quot;Kick his fuckin' ass!&quot; can be heard. Justin and Craig stand up. Jason and Scott remain seated. One of Michael's minions yells &quot;Kick his ass!&quot; Another, &quot;Kick his fuckin' ass!&quot; Michael slaps Trey on the back of his head. Scott: Was that really necessary? Michael: Why don't you tell me. Scott: Look. Let him sit down and eat his lunch. You can kick his ass some other time what with you being so manly and all. Michael: I can kick his ass now. (He takes two steps in Trey's direction. Scott stands up . . . which is stupid. Scott has been beaten on a regular basis for three years now. Everyone knows that Scott doesn't hit back anymore. People who fight Scott are no longer rewarded for doing so because who couldn't beat up the guy who never hits back? Yet they do it anyway. What does Scott hope to accomplish here?) Get out of my way. (Scott continues to stand in his way. The bell rings. Lunch is over. Scott grabs his bookbag and starts to walk away.) Don't you turn your back to me! Scott: Sorry but I have a class to get to. Michael: Fuck that! (Michael pushes Scott to the ground. Scott wonders what happened to kicking Trey's ass. He looks to a visibly apologetic Trey and knows he'll be able to extort an Icee or two out of this. He picks himself up and starts walking to class.) Come back here you fuckin' pussy! Scott: I'm going to class. (Scott decides not to...</span></a></div>
