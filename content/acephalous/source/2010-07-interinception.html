When Nolan did attempt to make viewers care about the characters, he did so in the most grossly manipulative of manners: he killed a wife and quasi-orphaned some children. Only who cared? They weren't people so much as necessary elements of his orderly plotting, without whom he couldn't have knocked over that first domino. &quot;Dominoes&quot; aren't the operative metaphor here, though. Inception was the equivalent of watching a grandmaster play an uninspired game against the village idiot. There's brilliance there, certainly, but it's pointless and wasted. *My personal theory is that no one had the gumption to tell Nolan this because The Dark Knight was the highest grossing film of all time." />

Not particularly insightful about anything, including dreams.  And yes, the &quot;here&#39;s why you care&quot; mechanics were a joke: &quot;We have to break up the company or they will Control All Energy!&quot;  &quot;Oh, uh, sure.  Here we go!&quot;  And don&#39;t name a character Ariadne, <i>particularly</i> if she&#39;s involved with making labyrinths.  But still fun to take in.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef013485b75d29970c-content"><p>I&#39;ll post a version of what I wrote on FB over here.</p>

<p>I loved it, and I don&#39;t imagine that I&#39;ll be able to convince you that you should have loved it, but hopefully I can persuade you that those of us who did enjoy it were not suffering from false consciousness.</p>

<p>I thought the over lapping dream worlds both completely fit with a dream-like logic and offered compelling narrative. I didn&#39;t find it an excercize in &quot;empty formalism&quot; (and I&#39;ve no idea what that would even mean in the context of film, though I would imagine something closer to Godfrey Reggio&#39;s work), I found it viscerally compelling.</p>

<p>Other than the fact that it&#39;s Ken Watanabe, I don&#39;t see how the character is Ra&#39;s Al Ghul. Like, at all.</p>

<p>We&#39;re generally not expected to care about the characters in a movie like this. Do we care about anyone in &quot;Oceans Elelven&quot; or &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (either one really, though the original is a much better movie) or say &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (to give something of an anti-hero example)? All that matters is that we find them interesting.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt was the possible weak link for me there, but I later realized his stiff performance earlier in the film made it possible for me to buy his calm demeanor in the elevator scene.</p>

<p>In terms of a depiction of dream world, &quot;Waking Life&quot; is still my favorite, but this took the representation of dreams in film and the question of what&#39;s at stake in really interesting directions, where the texture of a dream can only bend so far before it breaks.   (Dreams are actually a really tricky thing to represent filmically.  Witness the goofy whimsical melodrama of &quot;The Science of Sleep&quot;.)  Certain aspects felt like cheats, as in the removal of moral danger in a shoot-em-up by having all the dream people be projections.  I questioned the ending, but within the rules set forth by the movie, it doesn&#39;t throw everything into question.  There&#39;s no possibility that it was all a dream (except in that fundamental epistemological uncertainty where you could be dreaming right now, dude!) just an open question about Cobb and Saito&#39;s fate.</p>

<p>I could offer my own theories as to why you didn&#39;t enjoy it (say, you brought far too much auteurist baggage to the viewing experience), but really it seems more a matter of me being willing to let some elements slide, like the necessary but tedious exposition, that took you out of the film. If you then jump to a discussion of why it&#39;s an objectively bad film, then I think you&#39;ve really missed a step.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef013485b853e3970c-content"><p>JPool, I am not having any of it.  I didn&#39;t see this film with any auteurish expectations.  I disliked *Momento* and *The Prestige*, and I thought *The Dark Knight* was a fine action movie that insisted on beating me over the head with its rather thin message (&quot;The Joker is a nihilist.  He doesn&#39;t believe anything, Lebowski.&quot;)  </p>

<p>All right.  And I *love* heist movies.  But the heart of the heist movie is its three-part structure: the gathering of the team; the training montage; and The Job.  Nolan screwed up at each level.  The only members who seemed to have any special or interesting talents were the architect and the chemist.  However, after thirty minutes about labyrinths and non-Euclidean geometry, we never *see* that stuff in action.  The dream-worlds are empty film sets, with no more visual imagination than a James Bond set.  Then there&#39;s the problem of why the chemist even goes along.  You&#39;d think he&#39;d stay awake on board the plane to monitor the sedation.  The sedations-within-the-sedation should need a real chemist, any more than the guns within the dream need a gun-maker or a sporting goods store for bullets.  </p>

<p>With the team-assembling and training sequences rendered trite and without wit or imagination, that leaves us with The Job.  Each level of the dream was unimaginative.  Each seemed like an empty pastiche of an action film, but without the wit of an Ocean&#39;s or Bourne or Bond film.  A zero-gravity fight in a hotel hallway might have been visually interesting, like, 10 years ago, before Crouching Matrix, Hidden Kill Bill.  </p>

<p>Finally, while a heist film doesn&#39;t need a complex psychological level of motivation, we do need some ethical differences between the villains and the thieves.  Nolan steals the *Superfly* &quot;one last job&quot; idea, thinking we&#39;ll sympathize with Leonardo&#39;s working for one evil corporation against another because he just wants to get home.  </p>

<p>But who watches that film and wants Leonardo to get home?  The character&#39;s a sociopath.  He doesn&#39;t *belong* near his children.  It would be like if *The Odyssey* was about a child molester and wife beater trying to get home to his wife and children.  </p>

<p>What bugs me is that Nolan&#39;s film is still justified as being &quot;visually interesting.&quot;  No, it&#39;s not.  No more than all the MSG in my ramen noodle cup makes it flavorful.  Visually interesting is *Sunset Boulevard* or *Inland Empire* or Greenaway&#39;s *Nightwatching*.  These are films with crews that know how to use lighting and cameras and set design.  Watching Paris fold in half is about as visually interesting as an Escher print: it&#39;s a gimmick, not an image.  Watch what David Lynch does with shadows in the first ten minutes of *Inland Empire* -- there&#39;s real non-Euclidean geometry, with light coming from all the wrong places, with shadows not matching the lights within the frame.  It is haunting.   </p></span>

I mean, I saw that you had posted a comment, and I thought, &quot;Oh, here&#39;s Luther, to tell us all one more time about how great modern blockbusters are.&quot;  So imagine my shock…</p>

<p>Pardon my smartassery.  I actually think you make good points about the flatness of the actual heist (although I personally liked the zero-g fight and the folding Paris).  And I don&#39;t think, pace JPool, the heist participants were very interesting—the British guy is just low-rent Jason Statham, and his rivalry with JG-L is a pure snooze.  The things they can <i>do</i> are cool, but they themselves are not very.</p>

<p>At the same time, I do think Nolan succeeded at making an interesting heist movie with no real antagonist, only Ciaran Murphy&#39;s mental resistance and Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s haunted memories of his dead wife.</p></span>

<p>I&#39;m glad that somebody else feels that way. </p>

<p>Actually, I should qualify that; I strongly disliked <i>Memento</i> and then, when I saw <i>The Prestige</i> I didn&#39;t particularly like it either but I decided that I had to give him some credit for taking the thematic aspects of <i>Memento</i> that made me wince and exaggerating them even further. </p>

<p>It made it seem like he had some particular artistic interest in the question of what circumstances might lead somebody to commit murder over and over again while (a) being in some way emotionally dead to the act and and/or having no motive that gives them any reason to have a particular animus towards the victim. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen either <i>The Dark Knight</i> or <i>Inception</i> (you wouldn&#39;t think that would be possible, as a reader of this blog) but I did think there was something interesting going on in the way that the two films of his that I have seen were both built around a specific theme that I happen to dislike.</p></span>

It was stylish, complex, fun to watch, and at least not dumb.  I don&#39;t think Nolan was actually trying to impress any philosophers with the &quot;is this a dream or real life?&quot; thing, but was content just playing with the complexity of how the different &quot;levels&quot; interact.</p>

<p>Scott, have you seen Primer?  I would be very interested in hearing your reaction to that film.</p>

<p>Also, I thought until just now that I&#39;d given you my (partner&#39;s) phone number, and that you had just never called me, but now I see that I actually said that I&#39;d call you.<br />
So I apologize for being a total flake.</p></span>

<p>Luther, I didn&#39;t say you had auterish expectations, just Scott.  You don&#39;t have to have any of it, but if you claim that the rest of us can&#39;t reasonably have any, then I think you&#39;re full of it.</p></span>

If the sleazy looking guy can conjure up a big gun with his imagination, anyone should be able to conjure up the special sedation he uses on them in the van.  And the film even says there&#39;s no reason for the architect to be in the dream.  She only comes along because she sees so deeply into Leonardo&#39;s tortured psyche (in five minutes, while his friend who&#39;s been with him the entire time has someone not figured out his issues).  The sleazy-looking guy&#39;s ability to &quot;forge&quot; faces is the only skill that is both mentioned *and* used in the plot inside the dream.</p>

<p>But hey, sure, to each his own.  And I&#39;ll continue to be outraged that David Lynch has to beg for funding while shit like this gets produced and marketed.</p></span>

There&#39;s a similar kind of tension in his remake of &quot;Insomnia&quot; (which I liked fine enough, even though I thought both Pacino and Williams were miscast; still not nearly as good as the original).</p>

<p>Luther, sorry, I wasn&#39;t clear.  You&#39;re right about the chemist, though you could justify his presence based on numbers (someone needs to stay in the first dream) or narrative efficiency (the bit about the effects of sedation wouldn&#39;t be as instantly convincing coming from anyone else).  What you wrote before was &quot;The only members who seemed to have any special or interesting talents were the architect and the chemist,&quot; which, as you acknowledge in your last comment, just wasn&#39;t the case.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s all in quibble town, but I think that if you&#39;re going to complain about the shit that gets produced, this film is an odd choice to focus your ire on.</p></span>

But it&#39;s by no means a classic.  The best filmic representation of a dream, in my opinion, is still Lynch&#39;s Mulholland Drive, which actually takes the parallel between dreams and cinema seriously.</p>

<p>A good example of a genre-based television episode that used dreams more effectively than Nolan does in Inception was the season finale of Buffy, season 4, where Buffy and her friends fall asleep and are pursued in their dreams by the ancestral memory of the first slayer.  Whedon brilliantly captures the architecture of dreams in a way that Nolan does not - i.e., the way that Xander crawls out of his bedroom into his icecream delivery truck into a scene from Apocalypse Now.  Nolan&#39;s film would have had more impact if his dream levels were similarly constructed out of emotionally-resonant memories.  Indeed, the only really effective dream sequence in the entire film is the one in which the Leonardo Di Caprio character shows off his own personal dream architecture - an elevator joining together various uncomfortable memories of his family life.</p></span>

The first is called &quot;American Manga,&quot; and in it I'll be teaching the first book and the film adaptation of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, a few episodes of Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Bryan Lee O'Malley's Scott Pilgrim. You'll note that I've chosen three series that have been adapted into films, but am only teaching one of the films. The idea is to get them to write about the films I'm not teaching with the tools they acquired from the one I did. Or they can focus on what the process of Americanization actually entails. (To that end I thought about including Cowboy Bebop and Serenity because they act like mirror images of each other: the former imagines fleeing a barely inhabitable Earth into a universe that is ostensibly Japanese, but heavily indebted to an explicitly American cultural ethos; the latter imagines fleeing &quot;Earth that was&quot; into a universe that is ostensibly frontier America, but heavily indebted to an explicitly Chinese cultural ethos. But then I tried lesson-planning that transoceanic cultural exchange and my head exploded.) The second is called &quot;Coming of Age&quot; at the moment, but could be changed into something along the lines of &quot;Confessional Comics&quot; depending on what other material I include.* To date I've selected Craig Thompson's Blankets and Alison Bechdel's Fun Home, and while I know there are a million other indie comics that fit the bill, outside of Ghost World I can't think of any other &quot;Coming of Age&quot; comics that have been adapted into film. (My general aversion to Clowes is the only reason I'm disinclined to use it.) As this is certainly a byproduct of a general summer malaise, I wonder what obvious item I'm overlooking. *If I lose the focus on &quot;Coming of Age&quot; and switch to the more general &quot;Confessional Comics,&quot; I could obviously include Pekar and his film.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/07/bit-more-on-inception.html"><span><strong>Bit more on Inception</strong> I’ve taken a lot of interesting flak [thanks Donald!] for my non-review of Inception, but before addressing it, I want to address Anderson’s comment at my old haunt: People who think Inception was “a royal piece of smoldering crap” haven’t seen enough genuinely bad movies, and really should never leave the safety of The Criterion Collection. I’m inclined to agree: if someone judges it to be worse than anything Michael Bay’s ever directed, they deserve their time in latte-sipping purgatory. As someone who strongly disliked the film, I can safely say that I didn’t think it an inferior film to Transformers. But to even head in that direction completely misses the point. I wasn’t judging the film as a film, a summer film, or a summer blockbuster film, but as a piece of Christopher Nolan’s body of work. The scale doesn’t slide from Bay to early Coppola; it’s internal to Nolan’s oeuvre, and as I’m not a critic who needs to concern himself with guiding the wallets of moviegoers, I’m free to discuss or be disgusted by Inception at will. Put differently: had I been unfamiliar with Nolan’s previous ventures, in all likelihood I would have enjoyed this film. But the obverse of that statement is that because I’m intimately familiar with his earlier work, I’m incapable of enjoying the film. I can appreciate its technical virtuosity and plot machinations, but this is old hat for Nolan. He’s already filmed a movie in reverse, so the fact that he can film one up didn’t rivet me. I found it predictable and disappointing, not kin to the Transformers franchise. I walked out for the same reason I stop fiddling with a Rubik’s Cube once I’ve solved it: the joy of a puzzle comes from the puzzling through it. Without any strong connection to any of its characters, Inception felt like a puzzle. Now, my friend Adam Roberts contends that my inability to sympathize with any of the characters is the result of my living a barren, childless existence. Adam beefs: Almost up to the last scene I was ready to come out of the cinema snarky, geared to join the the Nolan-ripe-for-a-backlash mob. Then with only a minute to go, the two kids turned and looked at the camera. I felt as if somebody had sheathed a sword in my chest. I felt genuinely, suddenly, unexpectedly, very moved. In part I think this is because Nolan prepped the scene with just enough, but not too many, earlier shots of the kids playing with their backs to us, and exiting camera right without turning to look at us. And in part it has to do with the peculiarly cinematic emotional entanglement of the scene: because I wanted the kids to look at me, but at the same time I kind-of dreaded the kids turning to look at me … The one thing which cinema can’t traduce, because it is the horizon of all cinematic possibility. The look. And the selective withholding that...</span></a></div>
