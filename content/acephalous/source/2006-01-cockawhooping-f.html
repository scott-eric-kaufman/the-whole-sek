Have they yet to learn that notoriety is not fame? They claim that the Yellow Book is the embodiment of the modern spirit. If this is true, then give us the old-fashioned spirit . . . whose aim is to please intelligent people and not to attract attention by &quot;tripping the cockawhoop&quot; in public. Indeed!

See what improvements time has wrought? Before Frey would have been imprisoned for writing about doing what he'd done. Now some suggest he should go to prison for not having done what he wrote about doing. (All those people, I should add, skulk around message boards formerly devoted to singing Frey's praises. Now they want blood . . . but not spit, snot, urine or vomit. They'll let him keep that. And his infamy. He can keep that too.) There's an interesting marital dilemma at the heart of this concerning Gay Talese, to whom the NY Times turned to for quotations about the ethics of fabrication in books stamped non-fiction, and Nan Talese, whose vanity imprint published Frey's book. I'll touch upon it later. Right now I have some self-imposed deadline dissertating to do." />

		<span id="comment-12844215-content"><p>Yeah, many memorists (and I&#39;m thinking mainly about David Eggers here) seem to be writing literary fiction anyway.  This isn&#39;t a problem, in my opinion, so I don&#39;t know what people are fretting about.  If the 9/11 Commission Report or a David McCollough book had blatantly forged facts, there would be a problem.  But seriously.  James Frey?  People need to get over themselves.  (Partly, I think the problem is that for some reason people perceive a sacred line between memoir and fiction that should not be crossed.  I dunno.)</p></span>

So no substantial new post this evening. Plus I've been busy reading The Secret Epidemic , Astro Turf , The Rainy Season and watching The Constant Gardener . I have been the very picture of responsibility all day. I even condensed my latest dissertation chapter into a single paragraph. A useful exercise for those drowning in the details. All of which is only to say: Yes I've been a bore tonight. (I can't rain all the time.) I promise more entertainminig edification tomorrow. 'Cause only Horace laps me in my pedagogical commitment . . . but sometimes even he or someone like him nods.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/01/why_some_subalt.html"><span><strong>Why Some Subaltern Should Not Speak</strong> Overheard in the hall outside my office today: Student #1: Then that asshole from my Asian American studies class said I didn't respect him 'cause he was Asian American. Student #2: But you're half-fucking-Vietnamese. Student #1: You think that'd matter? He'd start spouting shit about me being the child of like colonial imperialism American nationalism. Student #2: So what'd you tell him? Student #1: I didn't say nothing. I should've said 'Look you smug fuck, you think people don't respect you 'cause you're Asian American but no one likes you because you're an asshole. I'm not silencing your voice or oppressing you. I just want you to shut the fuck up about the politics of why no one listens to you when no one listens to you because you're such a fucking asshole.' Fuck! I can't be entirely certain, but I think this strange theoretical fluency may be peculiar to Irvine. To overhear theoretically sophisticated undergraduates complaining about the illegitimate theoretical assumptions of another undergraduate isn't something that happens on college campuses across the country. Or is it? Or is my calling these students &quot;theoretically sophisticated&quot; a bit of an exaggeration? It certainly is. But they're by no means necessarily less sophisticated than the ideologue whose behavior they so colorfully declaimed. I could spin my own yarn about the deeper significance of this conversation, but it would only recapitulate the Fifty-Seventh of Scott's Distributive Characterological Population Lemmata: Number of People You Know/2 = Number of Assholes You Know</span></a></div>
