Our discourse--all discourse--moves with and against the chora in the sense that it simultaneously depends upon and refuses it. Although the chora can be designated and regulated, it can never be definitively posited: as a result, one can situate the chora and, if necessary, lend it a topology, but one can never give it axiomatic form (26).

struggling to write-and live-some other corporeality. If I succeed I
will butcher the tendency toward both textual and bodily assimilation.
The underbelly cut open, vulnerable, fragmented, and inconsistent, is
astutely mine. A body or a text without normative punctuality is
obscene, unrequited. It arrives late to the masquerade, attracts
fearful attention during the dance, and absconds alone and abashed.
Textual mortification signifies a death of possibility. The text and
the body entangled so that centuries of repression of the body spawn
infinite chapters of standardized discourse. If the ears repeatedly
hear the phrase &quot;remember&quot;, the purveyor (us) is less likely to produce
dreary and banal discourse. Yet the cultural mantra most often heard is
&quot;forget&quot;, whispered hypnotically while we squirm through institutions.
Forget what enraptures you and do what everyone else has done. Walk
down a corridor enclosed by walls, enter a lackluster room. The docile
body begins here. Construct yourself as you have already been
constructed; repeat what you have remembered; develop ways to cope with
the cemented punctuation of your body (or text) </p>

<p>Knowledge I knew but
embodiment evaded me. McRuer infers that I should be able to
encapsulate bodily difference inside text. Cixous did it. Many have
dug a deeper trench than I am about to dig. I am writing the body into
the ground. The embodied feminized earth, dark sin (without) an
association with war. Strategic disembowlment or as McRuer writes,
de-composition. Though its not of any body nor is it anybody. It's a
specific body. One unencumbered by any other. Pleasantly unadjudicated.
The phrase itself-<em>the body</em>-evolved as a linguistic conundrum. Many have said that no universal entity exists called <em>the body</em>. It would bewilder us if some iconoclast referred to every tree as-<em>the tree</em>-yet
we constantly legitimate a universal body without ever remembering the
fallacy. This anomaly of universalizing many bodies into one body
signifies the extent to which culture demands that all bodies measure
up to the universalized One. Greek god hails judiciously from past
centuries. Most of us flee.
</p>

<p>I choose content, voice,
and tone and steer discourse and materiality away from what is
familiar. That's what scared the anonymous him. Not just its mention,
but mostly its significance. Writing vulva n(ot any old vulva but a
vulva that resembles no other vulv)a. Putting vulva back into the
equation. Googling it (try it), understanding it, staring at the photos
in its irregular, incoherent, loose wet state. The response was one of
&quot;hmmm&quot; (himmm) &quot;what do you mean, this writing on the body?&quot; I am told
not to-that it won't get me published or it won't be appropriate or
neat or nice. We need information instead &quot;we are looking for objective
information. An (al)maniacal deluge would not be enough information.
Can't you write nice?
</p>

<p>When Cixous wrote the body
30 years ago she wanted women to put themselves into the text, dig
deep, write out-loud, and reconfigure phallocentric language (try
google-ing &quot;phallocentric language&quot; and you'll find &quot;step outside
phallocentric language&quot; under the heading of &quot;alien&quot;). Strategic
disembodiment happens at birth when they slap it out of you. You were a
body now you are a gender. The third gender puzzles doctors everytime
as if something that happens naturally somehow is not a natural
happening. Stagnant. Still. Everything is fine in its little box,
tightly concealed. From womb through the canal squeezed out into space
(defined by matter) while momma is sewn back together. You were a
gender now you are a worker. Not any worker but a worker that resembles
no other worker. Punctilious. </p>

<p>Freelance will do that to
you. Digging a deep trench, I shove corpus animus down into the earth
and feel the muck and sludge of so many failures. Can't you write nice?
As the one universalized body must be ideal, so must the text. Even the
term &quot;the essay&quot; fondles modernist rhetoric. The literary essay is
known both quantitatively and qualitatively as the great warrior
Hannibal (who was actually black). I want to write the body because it
is dangerous and erotic. Writing matters only when I write the
underbelly of the essay. Bodies and texts are socially constructed so
that I do not wish to replicate uniformity or able-bodiedness in my
writing. This essay is not to be judged against an ideal yet it is
meant to be embodied in a person, a voice, hands typing, sexuality,
ethnicity. Ideology is unveiling the skin beneath your clothing.
Concepts are the fullness of your curve. Embodiment happens when events
occur, when reality of the body is the presiding phenomenon at that
time. Bodies have been extracted from history and reality except as 1)
ideal or 2) disfigured, deformed, or abnormal. No. 1 exploits no. 2.
Embodiment is agency when mind/body subject/object public/private
coalesce. The scene is institutional hegemony and the act is resisting
the compulsion to submit to anything other than what is safely erotic.
You are the agent. As Burke writes, the bodily overlaps with both the
intimate and the institutional. Foucault's &quot;docile body&quot; stiffens with
today's perfunctory education and we have lost contact with our
underbellies.
</p>

<p>Hang on. The health of this
text is at risk. It is at risk of being scorned by neocons and
traditionalists-or worse-of not being published. This text as my body
might be colonized or forgotten. The cultural practice of composition
offers no protection against vulnerability or perfectionism. The body
must be strengthened, manicured, and fixed…continuously. The
text must be primed for the swim suit competition. Only those without
prior health conditions need apply as if there is this other universal
thing called &quot;health&quot;. Show me the perfect person and I'll show you the
perfect text. I am hobbling away now.</p></blockquote><p>Fish in a barrel, my friend, fish in a barrel. </p>

<p>*A Lacanian with whom I briefly shared an office once informed me, and I paraphrase here, that &quot;Lacan thought seriously about names and their effect on development.&nbsp; I don't see anything wrong with teaching a lesson in a freshman composition class on how Richard Caputo's politics derive from the fact that he is, nominally and probably really too, a 'dick head.'&quot;&nbsp; </p>

A couple of questions for his new bride: Do you really like him, or do you also believe &quot;marriage appears as an act which belongs to the domain of universal symbolic determinations and should as such be independent of personal idiosyncrasies--as if the very notion of marriage does not involve precisely the 'pathological' fact of liking a particular person for no particular rational reason.&quot; Do you know that his &quot;ideal couple&quot; consists of Kant and Sade? Do you know who wears the pants in that household? Or are Kant and Sade just another &quot;everyday aseptic/impotent modern couple&quot; incapable of transposing the vertical into the horizontal? How is Zizek at transposing the vertical into the horizontal? Does he &quot;stage these fantasies openly, without the secondary perlaboration which usually masks inconsistensies&quot; or are his secondary perlaborations vital to his operationalizations? How long can he operationalize before pure egotistic fear gets the best of him? How do you feel about &quot;deadlocks&quot;? You like 'em too? Thought so. I'd love to hear your stance on, say, &quot;the deadlock of desire,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of the transcendental imagination,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of today's Left,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of the superego,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of the dialogue between the Western New Left and the Eastern European dissisdents,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of masculine subjectivity,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of symbolization onto the biological opposition of male and female,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of the pseudo-revolutionary critics of religion,&quot; &quot;the deadlocks of sexual relationship,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of the Tarkovskian hero,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of post-politics,&quot; &quot;the deadloack of repressive desublimation,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of sexuality or art today,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of multicultural intolerance,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of impossibility,&quot;&quot;the deadlock of global capitalism,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of cultural resistence to capitalism,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of formalization in le symbolique,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of the contemporary world,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of the 90's,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of upper-class myths of power lost,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of positing,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of the dialectic,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of the subject's radical uncertainty as to its status (what I am qua object for the Other,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of human thought,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of an essentialist subjectivity,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of circularity,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of 1914,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of depoliticisation,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of sexuation,&quot; &quot;the deadlock of language,&quot; and most importantly, &quot;the deadlock of his [i.e. your new beau's] previous positions.&quot; Do you realize that's how he looks all gussied up?</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/04/amazons_statist.html"><span><strong>Amazon's Statistically Improbable Phrases</strong> Amazon's new feature: Amazon.com Statistically Improbable Phrases: Amazon.com’s Statistically Improbable Phrases, or “SIPs”, show you the interesting, distinctive, or unlikely phrases that occur in the text of books in Search Inside the Book. Our computers scan the text of all books in the Search Inside program. If they find a phrase that occurs a large number of times in a particular book relative to how many times it occurs across all Search Inside books, that phrase is a SIP in that book. SIPs might be the new Cliff Notes. You can learn everything that makes a particular work unique by them. For instance, the SIPs in Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom!--monkey nigger, wild negroes, wild niggers-- say all anybody needs to know about this classic work of American literature. What could you possibly need to know about Abraham Lincoln that you couldn't glean from his SIPs: not exist within their limits, cotten goods, policy that agitation, cannot exclude slavery, abolition platform, cranberry laws, annual joyous return, prohibited therein, requisite population, provision for submitting, unconstitutionally commenced, slavery therein, territorial existence, acquiring additional territory, nationalize slavery, unconditional repeal, ask your attention, slave constitution, unfriendly legislation, alike lawful, abolition counties, own way subject, long continued applause, useless labour, carry slavery. American History 101! Who needs college? Not you! Cornered by an annoying Holy Roller? Don't want to admit you haven't had time to read The Mark: The Beast Rules the World (Left Behind No. 8)? No problem! The SIPs know all: enforcement facilitators, old safe house, loyalty mark. Smile, smack 'em on the back and tell 'em &quot;Better slap on those loyalty marks before the enforcement facilitators break down the doors of the old safe house!&quot; You and he or she will be brothers or sisters or siblings in Christ before you know it. David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest is as intellectually weighty as it is, well, weighty. Always wanted to be a member of the intellectual elite? Never had the time to read a 1300 page novel with 300 pages of footnotes? No problem! Just tell 'em you loved it, what with all the entertainment cartridges, annular fusion, dawn drills, professional conversationalist, feral hamsters. They'll be so impressed! This time you'll make them say her momma! And finally, a missive from the future: &quot;Damn, A. Cephalous, I'd love to read Ulysses but I can't find the time,&quot; says Some Gay Guy. You're in luck. It just so happens that I've its SIPs right here on my desktop: tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom, quaker librarian, absentminded beggar, matrimonial gift, base barreltone. &quot;What about A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man?&quot; What about it? &quot;What's the deal with it?&quot; I see, I see. It's a relatively simple book about epiphany technique, fallen seraphim, ardent ways, windless hour, esthetic image. P.S. Some Gay Guy: Next time you find yourself at a trendy West Hollywood party surrounded by queer theorists, I've found a hoard of conversation starters for you: washroom sex, ridiculous theater, queer structure, gay punk, lesbian...</span></a></div>
