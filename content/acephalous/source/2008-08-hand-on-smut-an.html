<p>On this day in 1934, Augustus Hand scored a second, binding victory
for psychological realism.&nbsp; Obscenity charges had bedeviled James Joyce’s <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/06/16/today-in-history/"><em>Ulysses</em></a>
before he even finished it.&nbsp; In 1920 the New York Society for the
Suppression of Vice convinced the Post Office to seize four
installments of the novel published in<em> The Little Review</em>:
“Lestrygonians,” “Scylla and Charybdis,” “Cyclops,” and “Nausicaa.”&nbsp; No
one had any clue what to make of the first three chapters, but the
fourth was <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/06/today-in-histor.html#comment-119413732">certainly somehow pornographic</a>.</p>
<p>The book-in-process was deemed obscene and banned.&nbsp; It would remain so until 1933, when Random House challenged the — <em>wait for it, wait for it </em>– <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/06/19/nomenclature/">Hawley-Smoot</a> (sometimes <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/06/17/asinine/">known as Smoot-Hawley</a>)
Tariff Act’s prohibition on immoral articles.&nbsp; In United States v. One
Book “Called Ulysses,” John Woolsey was only asked to determine whether
the novel was obscene.&nbsp; His opinion, however, was a tactful, informed
defense of psychological realism:</p>
<blockquote><p>In writing “Ulysses,” Joyce sought to make a serious
experiment in a new, if not wholly novel, literary genre. He takes
persons of the lower middle class living in Dublin in 1904 and seeks,
not only to describe what they did on a certain day early in June of
that year as they went about the city bent on their usual occupations,
but also to tell what many of them thought about the while.</p>
<p>Joyce has attempted — it seems to me, with astonishing success — to
show how the screen of consciousness with its ever-shifting
kaleidoscopic impressions carries, as it were on a plastic palimpsest,
not only what is in the focus of each man’s observation of the actual
things about him, but also in a penumbral zone residua of past
impressions, some recent and some drawn up by association from the
domain of the subconscious. He shows how each of these impressions
affects the life and behavior of the character which he is describing.</p>
<p>What he seeks to get is not unlike the result of a double or, if
that is possible, a multiple exposure on a cinema film, which would
give a clear foreground with a background visible but somewhat blurred
and out of focus in varying degrees.</p>
<p>To convey by words an effect which obviously lends itself more
appropriately to a graphic technique, accounts, it seems to me, for
much of the obscurity which meets a reader of “Ulysses.” And it also
explains another aspect of the book, which I have further to consider,
namely, Joyce’s sincerity and his honest effort to show exactly how the
minds of his characters operate.</p>
<p>If Joyce did not attempt to be honest in developing the technique
which he has adopted in “Ulysses,” the result would be psychologically
misleading and thus unfaithful to his chosen technique. Such an
attitude would be artistically inexcusable.</p>
<p>It is because Joyce has been loyal to his technique and has not
funked its necessary implications, but has honestly attempted to tell
fully what his characters think about, that he has been the subject of
so many attacks and that his purpose has been so often misunderstood
and misrepresented. For his attempt sincerely and honestly to realize
his objective has required him incidentally to use certain words which
are generally considered dirty words and has led at times to what many
think is a too poignant preoccupation with sex in the thoughts of his
characters.</p></blockquote>
		</div>
					<a id="more"></a>
			<div class="entry-more">
				<p>Woolsey then went one step further: he sought out two people with
“average sexual instincts [to play] in this branch of legal inquiry,
the same role of the hypothetical reagent as does the ‘reasonable man’
in the law of torts and ‘the man learned in the art’ on questions of
invention in patent law.” To wit:</p>
<blockquote><p>After I had made my decision in regard to the aspect of
“Ulysses,” now under consideration, I checked my impressions with two
friends of mine who in my opinion answered to the above-stated
requirement for my reagent.</p>
<p>These literary assessors — as I might properly describe them — were
called on separately, and neither knew that I was consulting the other.
They are men whose opinion on literature and on life I value most
highly. They had both read “Ulysses,” and, of course, were wholly
unconnected with this cause.</p>
<p>Without letting either of my assessors know what my decision was, I
gave to each of them the legal definition of obscene and asked each
whether in his opinion “Ulysses” was obscene within that definition.</p>
<p>I was interested to find that they both agreed with my opinion: That
reading “Ulysses” in its entirety, as a book must be read on such a
test as this, did not tend to excite sexual impulses or lustful
thoughts, but that its net effect on them was only that of a somewhat
tragic and very powerful commentary on the inner lives of men and women.</p></blockquote>
<p>The US Attorney’s office challenged Woolsey’s learned decision, so the case — now properly named United States v. One Book <em>Entitled</em>
“Ulysses” by James Joyce — went before the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals, where the aforementioned Augustus Hand, his illustrious cousin
Learned, and the <a href="http://law.jrank.org/pages/2961/Martin-T-Manton-Trial-1939--Without-Regard-Merits.html">infamous Martin Manton</a> heard the case.&nbsp; Manton’s dissent was predictable:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="DocumentBody">Who can doubt the obsenity of
this book after a reading of the pages referred to, which are too
indecent to add as a footnote to this opinion? Its characterization as
obscene should be quite unanimous by all who read it.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Seems <em>his </em>literary assessor — himself and an invisible electorate of the easily offended — differed from Woolsey’s.&nbsp; For Manton, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it">“I know it when I see it” standard</a> obtained, so he called it like he saw it.&nbsp; Augustus Hand saw it much as Woolsey and his assessors had:</p>
<blockquote><p>James Joyce, the author of “Ulysses,” may be regarded as
a pioneer among those writers who have adopted the “stream of
consciousness” method of presenting fiction, which has attracted
considerable attention in academic and literary circles. In this field
“Ulysses” is rated as a book of considerable power by persons whose
opinions are entitled to weight. Indeed it has become a sort of
contemporary classic, dealing with a new subject-matter. It attempts to
depict the thoughts and lay bare the souls of a number of people, some
of them intellectuals and some social outcasts and nothing more, with a
literalism that leaves nothing unsaid. Certain of its passages are of
beauty and undoubted distinction, while others are of a vulgarity that
is extreme and the book as a whole has a realism characteristic of the
present age. It is supposed to portray the thoughts of the principal
characters during a period of about eighteen hours.</p>
<p>We may discount the laudation of Ulysses by some of its admirers and
reject the view that it will permanently stand among the great works of
literature, but it is fair to say that it is a sincere portrayal with
skillful artistry of the “streams of consciousness” of its characters.
Though the depiction happily is not of the “stream of consciousness” of
all men and perhaps of only those of a morbid type, it seems to be
sincere, truthful, relevant to the subject, and executed with real art.
Joyce, in the words of Paradise Lost, has dealt with “things
unattempted yet in prose or rime” — with things that very likely might
better have remained “unattempted” — but his book shows originality and
is a work of symmetry and excellent craftsmanship of a sort. The
question before us is whether such a book of artistic merit and
scientific insight should be regarded as “obscene” within section
305(a) of the Tariff Act.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hand’s opinion outstripped Woolsey’s in one important respect: it
accorded Joyce’s novel “scientific insight.”&nbsp; It is a textbook of sorts
— a sincere document of bestial humanity at its most sordid — but it
has value <em>as such</em>.&nbsp; Literature, for Hand, has anthropological
and ethnographical import, and should be assessed not by its
performance of established value, but by the truthfulness of its
depiction of lived experience:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="DocumentBody">It is settled, at least so
far as this court is concerned, that works of physiology, medicine,
science, and sex instruction are not within the statute, though to some
extent and among some persons they may tend to promote lustful
thoughts. </span><span class="DocumentBody">We think the same immunity
should apply to literature as to science, where the presentation when
viewed objectively, is sincere, and the erotic matter is not
introducted to promote lust and does not furnish the dominant note of
the publication. The questions in each case it whether a publication
taken as a whole has a libidinous effect. The book before us has such
portentous length, is written with such evident truthfulness in its
depiction of certain types of humanity, and is so little erotic in its
result, that it does not fall within the forbidden class.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Its “portentious length” and “evident truthfulness” denude <em>Ulysses</em>
of erotic effect.&nbsp; It’s a rousing defense, but it’s not altogether
honest, at least not from our modern perspective.&nbsp; We wouldn’t defend
the erotic in literature by declaring an author’s intent and an
audience’s response to be <em>clinical</em>.&nbsp; <em></em></p>
<p><em>Ulysses</em> is erotic — we know it when we read it — as are
many of the classics Woolsey and Hand cite.&nbsp; And we read it, when we
read it, because we know it to be so.&nbsp; We <em>like</em> a little erotic in our literature.&nbsp; What Hand describes resembles the cold steel and paled flesh of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1559408871/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Dead Ringers</em></a>, a film whose commitment to the body shares as little with <em>Ulysses</em> as two works in which sex happens possibly can.</p>

I have no clue why you share what you share through Google Reader. Since neither rhyme nor reason guides your selections, I can only assume you're playing a schizophrenic in an online LARP to which I'm not privy. Not quite. The reason I share posts about bands I've never heard of, science I don't understand, theorists whose work baffles me, painfully cute cat hijinks, the physics of baseball, and the stupidity of prominent columnists is that I'm on some computer other than my desktop and want to revisit those posts when I'm on my main machine. (Ninety-percent of the time, I'm on my wife's laptop but want to download an .mp3 or two to the computer my .mp3 player syncs with.) If you'd rather not have my contingent list of random items appear in your RSS reader, you can &quot;hide&quot; me via this link. (Something's off about the use of &quot;hide&quot; there. The idea of you being able to hide me without my knowing about it is unsettling. I'm nobody's unwitting Anne Frank. You can't be discretely secreting me to annexes without my consent or, and this is the unsettling part, my not realizing you've done so. I'm nobody's unwitting Truman, either. But I digress.) If for some reason you want my mental ejecta cluttering up your RSS reader, you can subscribe to it via the same link. Honestly though, you have much better things to do with your time. I'm not even sure why you're reading this. You already know how to subscribe or unsubscribe, so these words—the ones you're currently, as in right now, reading—they're totally superfluous and you know it. So why are you still reading them? Too tired to Ctrl-w back to something sensible? Afflicted with dread textual inertia? Do you think maybe I'm building up to something funny, even though by now you're almost certain I'm not, but there's still a chance I am, and if I am you don't want to miss it? Rest easy, dear reader. Had you stopped, you wouldn't have missed a thing.</span></a></div>
