        <meta name="description" content="The plot of this blog post is about why I have not been posting and I am writing it like this because my wife, to whom I am married, is currently grading papers. She uses the adjective &quot;excellent&quot; to describe the papers to me. It is a descriptive word. Its description is emotional and resonates to people who have emotions. The reason I have not been blogging, which I mentioned earlier is crucial to the plot of this blog post, is for many reasons. The first reason is that I have been watching my iRobot Roomba vacuum the apartment. Although it is supposed to be a time-saving device, many experts believe that the time people waste watching an iRobot Roomba vacuum an apartment eliminates the function of its time-saving. The second reason I have not been blogging is because I have been exercising. According to the government agency called the National Institute of Health in a book with the title Energize Yourself! Stay Physically Active, it is important to stay physically active because physical activity: can make you feel more energetic can help you lose weight and control your appetite help you sleep better Other benefits include: lower your chance for diabetes lower your chance for a stroke lower your blood pressure The National Institute of Health is from the government and a reliable source. Therefore I believe and trust them because they are trustworthy. Exercise and physical activity are a good thing and I am doing them instead of blogging. The third and final reason that I am not blogging is because I hate Mark Twain. Mark Twain was an American writer in the last century. His many books, which include masterpieces like Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, are called masterpieces by the experts in literature who read them. Mark Twain is also a rat-bastard who spins gleefully in his grave every time a scholar tries to figure out the racial politics of Pudd'nhead Wilson. This is the third and last of the three reasons I have not been blogging." />

		<span id="comment-116359998-content"><p>Roombas make me miss Hitherby Dragons, because Hitherby Dragons had as one of minor characters a Roomba which had developed an End of Everything button, probably through prolonged exposure to a magical area.  One of the characters once thanked another for not pushing the End of Everything button even though, for someone of a curious disposition, it was difficult not to.  Hitherby Dragons never reached the End of Everything because its writer stopped writing it and may or may not start again.  I suspect that the writer of Hitherby Dragons was actually one personality of a person suffering from MPD who has now integrated, so the writer of Hitherby Dragons may effectively no longer exist as such.</p>

<p>Hitherby Dragons was excellent, much more excellent than I suspect that the papers that your wife is grading could be.  Back when I thought that literary types had some interest in &quot;discovering&quot; new literature, I tried to call people&#39;s attention to Hitherby Dragons, since I suspect that it is an undiscovered work that could become canonical, especially if it were ever finished.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-116376444-content"><p>The 1958 Mad Magazine parody of that poem has completely displaced my memory of the original: I&#39;ll quote it here so it may do others the same service:</p>

<p>I wandered lonely as a clod, <br />
Just picking up old rags and bottles, <br />
When on my weary way I plod, <br />
I saw a host of axolotls; <br />
Beside the lake, beneath the trees, <br />
A sight to make a man&#39;s blood freeze. </p>

<p>Some had handles, some were plain; <br />
They came in blue, red, pink, and green. <br />
A few were orange in the main; <br />
The damndest sight I&#39;ve ever seen. <br />
The females gave a sprightly glance; <br />
The male ones all wore knee-length pants. </p>

<p>Now oft, when on the couch I lie, <br />
The doctor asks me what I see. <br />
They flash upon my inward eye <br />
And make me laugh in fiendish glee. <br />
I find my solace then in bottles, <br />
And I forget them axolotls. </p>

<p><br />
By Tom Koch, if the internet can be trusted.  (And of course it can.)  I also remember reading somewhere that this is the most widely parodied poem in the English language.</p>

<p>I also remember hearing that the actual first line of the original version of the poem was &quot;I wandered lonely as a cow&quot;.  There&#39;s something to be said for revision, I suppose.</p></span>

<p>I wandered lonely as a cloud<br />
That floats on high o&#39;er vales and pines,<br />
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br />
A host, of golden dandelions;<br />
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br />
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze....</p>

<p>For oft, when on my couch I lie<br />
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br />
They flash upon that inward eye<br />
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br />
And then my heart with pleasure whines,<br />
And dances with the dandelions.</p></span>

<p>Rich, you ought to know better.  I don&#39;t have time to read anything I haven&#39;t already read five times before, elsewise how would I plumb <em>more</em> meaning from its frequently meager depths?</p>

<p><em>The 1958 Mad Magazine parody of that poem has completely displaced my memory of the original.</em></p>

<p><b>1958</b>?  Why are you reading <em>Mad</em> magazines from <b>1958</b>?</p>

<p><em>If I ever see that poem again, I might smash my own head in with a Roomba.</em></p>

<p>Not mine!  You leave [<em>SEK&#39;s offensive name for his Roomba</em>] alone!</p>

<p>Martin, that deserves its own post.  Lo and behold!  There it is!</p>

<p><em>Pudd&#39;nhead Wilson is my favorite novel by Twain, and I think you&#39;ve put your finger on why.</em></p>

<p>Ray, you like <em>PW</em> because it prevents me from finishing the dissertation?  That&#39;s just cruel.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/05/a-1114.html"><span><strong>A: 1,114</strong> Q: How many words does Terry Eagleton write before he mentions the name of the author whose book he purports to review? I grouse because I care. I intended this post to be about the remarkable act of compression in the first paragraph. It's a thing of wonder, if you wonder about things like &quot;How can I lucidly jam the History of Everything into a single paragraph?&quot; Eagleton's answer: All literary works are anonymous, but some are more anonymous than others. It is in the nature of a piece of writing that it is able to stand free of its begetter, and can dispense with his or her physical presence. In this sense, writing is more like an adolescent than a toddler. I might pass you a note at a meeting, but a note is only a note if it can function in my absence. Writing, unlike speech, is meaning that has come adrift from its source. Some bits of writing—theatre tickets or notes to the milkman, for example—are more closely tied to their original contexts than Paradise Lost or War and Peace. Fiction (since it is imaginary) has no real-life original context at all, and hermeneutically speaking can therefore circulate a lot more freely than a shopping list or a bus ticket. Literary works are peculiarly portable. They can be lifted from one interpretative situation to another, and may change their meaning in the course of this migration. Waiting for Godot as performed in San Quentin prison is not quite the same play as Peter Hall’s first London production. We cannot simply put Auschwitz out of our minds while watching The Merchant of Venice. Writerly meaning does not always trump readerly meaning. Walter Benjamin believed that works of literature secreted certain meanings which might be released only in their afterlife, as they came to be read in as yet unforeseeable situations. He thought much the same about history in general. The past itself is alterable, since the future casts it in a new light. Whether John Milton belonged to a species which ended up destroying itself is up to us and our progeny. The future possibilities of Hamlet are part of the play’s meaning, even though they may never be realised. One of the finest English novels, Samuel Richardson’s 18th-century masterpiece Clarissa, became newly readable in the light of the 20th-century women’s movement. Disagree with him if you must—and most of the time, I must—but plaudit him when his prose demands admiration.</span></a></div>
