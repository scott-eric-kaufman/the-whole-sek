		<span id="comment-62413078-content"><p>You realize that, as a rhetorical assertion, this leaves readers tangled in so many loops that sorting them out is beyond my poor abilities (see, now you&#39;ve got me doing it.)  But I&#39;ll try:</p>

<p>1.  (the naive reading) This is an example of exaggerated self-deprecation, and as such, calls for reassurance.</p>

<p>2.  (the literalist reading) This is an example of serious self-criticism, and as such, calls for criticism.</p>

<p>3. (the experienced reading) A good amount of the stock-in-trade of Acephalous is self-deprecation -- people read the blog in part for these displays, which provide an authorial persona and a bridge between literary studies and personal events.  As such, this calls for irony.</p>

<p>4. (the psychological reading) The deprecation is unusually advanced even for Acephalous, which together with the woodshed image suggests that Scott may really be feeling exceptionally bad about his writing.  This calls for carefully calibrated joshing combativeness, as suggested by the last sentence.</p>

<p>5. (the historicist reading) Since we know that Scott is currently engaged in finishing a dissertation, and since almost everyone reading this blog has some idea of what that must be like, this is best theorized as a statement linked to a particular stage rather than something particular to Scott.  It calls for, probably, appeals to stoicism.</p>

<p>6.  (the exhausted reading)  Oh, the ipecac thing was fine.   People are obviously still reading, right?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-62444684-content"><p>I am notoriously neurotic about my own writing.  I revise for hours at a time, sometimes the fruit of a day&#39;s labor is something like five sentences.  An example of this practice is the 30 or so minutes I&#39;ve spent composing this comment.  It grew to about three times its current (total) size before I nearly deleted the whole thing, but decided to keep it as an example of itself.  I don&#39;t write anything down on paper, because even if I&#39;m satisfied with what I write when I write it, my writing seems to wither with time, and often after only a few hours I&#39;m disgusted with it enough to trash it.  Volumes have been lost in this manner.  I have trouble with anything that I can&#39;t delete when I can see my own naivity in it.  <br />
I have a blog which I&#39;m using to combat these tendencies with limited success.   This success is somewhat mysterious as it&#39;s driven by both the expectation of having to be accountable to an audience (which at the moment doesn&#39;t exist except as a hypothetical motivator) and by the fact that my choice of topics (thus far primarily short reviews of introductory books on some topics that were in vogue in the 1970s) is at the moment neither deep enough nor of interest general enough to necessitate any reasonable amount of scrutiny.  I&#39;m slowly expanding, as I&#39;m right now beginning to work through some books about and/or by some continental philosophers that I&#39;ve never felt I had a very good grip on, so the situation is hopeful, though I doubt I&#39;ll ever really get an audience.</p></span>

<p>Dragon Management, I damn near deleted your comment when I saw your name.  Glad I didn&#39;t.  In my case, however, I&#39;m my harshest critic.</p>

<p>Rich, you forgot one:</p>

<blockquote>7. (the &quot;new ironist&quot; reading) Scott is a sentimental perfectionist, and as such litters <i>Acephalous</i> with serious intellectual misgivings coated with audience-friendly ironic distance.  He <i>may</i> be talking about himself -- and probably is -- but he may not be.  He is not, after all, a confessional blogger, and so when he writes posts like this, they possess enough irony that he can disown them to himself one moment and commiserate (read: <i>wallow</i>) the next.  This calls for a confused audience and the composition of lists.</blockquote>

<p>J.S. Nelson, I&#39;d actually read through your blog after you&#39;d commented earlier here, and had I not be <i>so totally through with literary theory, like, <b>forever</b></i>, I would&#39;ve commented on the Barry post.  That said, I think there&#39;s a certain amount of comment-box insecurity which disappears once you find yourself in a comfortable place.  Oddly, a lot of the more combative places I&#39;m perfectly fine posting, but people&#39;s more personal sites?  I can&#39;t do it.  Something about their singular voice being too strong, or their posts meaning too much to them, that makes me not want to sully it.  As for building an audience, well, I think you do that through commenting.  The more eyes you have on your words, the more likely they are to click through and see what you have to say about other topics.  I agree, though, that some kind of focus is required.</p>

<p>Me?  I shift focus every few months, and it&#39;s interesting to watch who follows me for the ride; sometimes people reappear after ages, comment regularly while I work through one or another obsession, then disappear again.  Then there are the people who read but only comment via email.  They&#39;re just strange.  (Who, <i>me?</i>  Calling <i>you</i> out?  Why, I <i>never</i>.)</p></span>

<p>And I&#39;ll have to pull the essay off my old lap top but roughly I focused on the first two games (though I&#39;d love to do a longer one on the 1-5, 6 and 7 break the pattern a tad and 8 has nothing but name in common, plus 6 could argued as being a retelling of <i>The Aeneid</i>, but I digress). </p>

<p>I basically discussed how Graham&#39;s quest in both games fit the epic style, for example centering on the founding of a great dynasty. The first two games also shares a good deal in common with so the called Questing epics. The brave and noble Knight facing trails to prove his worth, then later questing to win a fair maiden. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll let you know if I can recover it from my old laptop. </p></span>

As I mentioned in the previous post, much of what we know about Jaka's life in the royal palace comes from Jaka's Story. In those later interviews, Sim himself suggests that we can trust the information communicated in this book—which is strange considering it is it delivered, secondhand, by Rick to Oscar Wilde, then embellished by the latter in an attempt to extort more money from his stingy publisher. Those of you who haven't read the book are no doubt confused, so let me back up. Here are the panels of the frame narrative from the first number of Jaka's Story (click to enlarge): Sim interleaves these images of Jaka's childhood with the main narrative—which involves, among other things, the return of Cerebus in Jaka's life and the consequences of the abortion I discussed last week—but as a frame composed by a notorious embellisher, the truth-content of these imbricate panels shouldn't be taken at face value. This is not to say they brim with conscious lies; only that of all the narrators ever, Oscar Wilde stands astride the pile of those I would trust the least. Consider this: the information contained in these panels is related to Wilde by Jaka's insecure husband, Rick. That's one layer of interference—and a significant one, given that the entire book will, in the end, turn on the breach of his trust. But more on that later; for now, I want to talk about what the habitation of Wilde's voice freed Sim to accomplish. Sim revels in ventriloquism—and well he should, as he is among the most talented literary ventriloquists I've come across. He's no Pynchon or Gaddis, mind you, but the man has talent. In addition to Wilde, Cerebus features believable impressions of the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges, and the Rolling Stones, to name but a few. When he decides to inhabit the voice of Oscar Wilde, he frees himself from the constraints of the narrative voice he's established in Cerebus. (This goes without saying. And yet, here I am, saying it.) At this point, I should mention Wally's desire for me to account for the introduction, because it would seem to be important here. After all, in it Sim says that he never considered Oscar a &quot;homosexual character&quot; per se (though homosexualist he is). First, last and always (to me) he is an Artist and the tragedy which befell Wilde, [he] can't view in any other context than &quot;Society vs. the Artist.&quot; (8) All well and good, and yet the relationship between Oscar and Jaka's husband, Rick, entails oodles of what we literary types call &quot;homosociality.&quot; I know, I know, you don't come here for the queer theory; but the drawing rooms in which Oscar and Rick meet; their secret liaisons, which Jaka spies from a distance; the fact that the sole topic of conversation when they meet is Rick's...</span></a></div>
