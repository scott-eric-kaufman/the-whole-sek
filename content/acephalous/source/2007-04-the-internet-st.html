The whole point of my article was that here was this turn-of-the-century guy Dennert making specific predictions that would prove spectacularly wrong, but they actually had a context in which they were not stupid ideas -- the first decade of the 20th century was an awfully interesting one for evolutionary biology, with the mechanism of inheritance in a state of discombobulating flux, and heresy against Darwin was excusable. Davidson should have been arguing with me, not you.</p></span>

Be warned, however, as he does do the police in different voices. His reading of Hugh Selwyn Mauberley in 1939 sounds like his answer to Joyce’s reading of Finnegans Wake, right down to the exaggerated (and, in Pound’s case, affected) Irish accent. Listen to how Joyce reads the line “a man and his bride embraced between them” and tell me he doesn’t ham it up. (You can try. I won’t listen.) The Joyce reading is from the ALP section of the Wake, and the text he reads is transcribed here.</span></a></div>
