My undergrads considered me to be an angel anyways (yes, that was an actual evaluation comment, weirdly enough), so I figured why bother.  Of course, I later abandoned my Ph.D. right after getting my thesis topic approved and went into an entirely different line of work, so maybe that isn&#39;t the best recommendation.  And of course you&#39;re not a grad student any more, you&#39;re an instructor -- which as best as I can make out means something like grad school as transmuted through the Anti-Life Equation.  (Add totally bogus sense of professional responsibility, remove hope.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef015432b85ec6970c-content"><p>Rich, think of a class like a litter of seven kittens.*  One of them will be evil, never to be petted, so you can ignore it.  Four of them will respond to general kitten-enticement principles: rubbing behind the eyes, smoothing down their sides, throwing crumbled balls around, etc.  But then you have the other two, the first of whom, for whatever reason, loves to flop down and offer you his belly to be rubbed, whereas the second demands you trace a path through the bridge of his nose, between his eyes, and back down his spine.  Now, if you tried either of the latter maneuvers on the four who respond to normal stimuli, they&#39;ll behave much like their evil sibling.  So you have one of two choices: teach to the four who respond normally, ignore all evil kittens, and hope the two unique kittens receive enough affection through conventional means, <em>or</em> provide a forum for both the unique kittens to acquire the attention they deserve, but also for the conventional ones to admit, on the sly as it were, that they like to have their brow-line traced, but never knew any other kitten ever did.</p>

<p>In short, then, office hours are for the benefit of unique kittens and those who don&#39;t know how unique they are yet.  </p>

<p>*Lest you think this analogy creepy, there&#39;s a box of kittens waiting to be adopted next to the food court, and they are adorable, and I stopped to play with them on my way to the office.  I&#39;m not going to say that any of them did anything <em>supremely</em> adorable like, hypothetically, successfully use its little paws to gain entry into my jacket pocket -- in which it, hypothetically again, perfectly fit -- I&#39;m just saying I have kittens on the brain for good reason.</p></span>

Can I ask a totally off topic question? You are the only person I thought would be able to answer this just off the top of your head. </p>

<p>Okay: When the narrator of Jack London&#39;s Before Adam claims that his dreams of the past are somehow the product of Weismann-ian &quot;germ plasm&quot; isn&#39;t he getting it wrong? Isn&#39;t Weismann&#39;s whole point that there is no Lamarckian passing-on of acquired characteristics?</p>

Which meant that he thought that the germplasm could be modified over time by alterations to the somatoplasm, which is what, if I&#39;d written my dissertation more informally, I would&#39;ve called &quot;backdoor Lamarckism.&quot;  A good rule of thumb vis-a-vis London and evolution is that he&#39;s an excellent resource for generating a list of the words that evolutionary thinkers of the time used, but that&#39;s the extent of his usefulness.</p></span>

Reader discretion is advised.] The Donalde caught me cursing, which as we all know I never do. Well, actually, the Donalde caught my student cursing, which as we all know they never do either. Then he proved I've cursed before by linking to an unformatted comment in a post that deemed me &quot;insufferable&quot; for writing those visual rhetoric posts you love—or at least the ones that receive the most random positive feedback. Because he's the Donalde, he fails to realize that I was being purposely insufferable because I'd been called &quot;insufferable,&quot; and that I sarcastically answered the question &quot;What the fucking fuck?&quot; with &quot;Q.F.E.F.D.&quot; But alas! It is not in the Donalde to recognize such things. However, it is in the Donalde to end a post in which he castigates me for cursing by calling me an &quot;asshat.&quot; He does as well with irony as he does sarcasm and Google: he suggests that I use the word &quot;cocksucker&quot; in private, when I not only use it quite publicly, I think it can be fucking poetry.</span></a></div>

STUDENT: Hi Scott! SEK: Do I know you? STUDENT: I'm from your afternoon class! SEK: I know everyone in my afternoon class. STUDENT: I may not have been there in a while. SEK: Define &quot;while&quot;? STUDENT: Some stuff that happened. Also things. SEK: How many classes did stuff and things cause you to miss? STUDENT: I was there for that class about how cameras work. SEK: Which one? STUDENT: The directors'? SEK: Which one's? STUDENT: Camera? SEK: Is that a quesiton? SEK can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, he only wishes he couldn't. It's just that some complaints are as inevitable as Phil Collins bringing bombast to fanfare, and this particular complaint most certainly pulls a pure Phil Collins. STUDENT: I don't know. I'm confused. SEK: As am I. Who are you again? STUDENT: I'm in your afternoon class! SEK: Then why don't I know you? STUDENT: Because some stuff and things happened and I stopped attending in Week Four. SEK: I'm sorry you had to go through stuff and things. Life is tough. What can I help you with now? STUDENT: What do I need to do to pass the class? SEK: Which one? STUDENT: Yours. SEK: The one you didn't attend? STUDENT: But I have a draft of my Rhetorical Analysis that I wrote to make it up to you. SEK: Make it up to me? This isn't about you making it up to me. It's about— STUDENT: Can you at least take a look at my draft? STUDENT hands SEK a draft of her &quot;Rhetorical Analysis.&quot; As he thought, it was a &quot;Rhetorical Analysis&quot; as performed by someone who had no idea what a rhetorical analysis is. SEK: This isn't a rhetorical analysis. STUDENT: It's about a horror movie. SEK: That wasn't really the focus of the class. STUDENT: It was called a horror class. SEK: The emphasis was on the creation of suspense. STUDENT: Saw II was suspenseful. SEK: Suspenseful torture porn, which if you were paying attention during the few classes you actually attended, you'd have remembered that that's a genre I repeatedly specified we'd be avoiding. STUDENT: But I heard you talking about it so it still meets your requirements. SEK: No, it doesn't. STUDENT: Yes, it does. SEK: How? STUDENT: I analyze the effect of a horror film. SEK: One I explicitly banned. STUDENT: That was the assignment. SEK: That was not the assignment. STUDENT: But it was! SEK: Then how come no one else in this class produced a similar document? STUDENT: You'd have to ask them. SEK: But they're not here now, so I'm asking you: how did twenty-four students aim their arrows at the same side of the same barn and strike it (with varying degrees of thump and wobble)? STUDENT: Some teachers don't push 'em hard enough. Who has 'em aiming at barns and all when they...</span></a></div>
