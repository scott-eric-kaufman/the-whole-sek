<p>He is, to borrow the language of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Lombroso">Cesare Lombroso</a>'s criminological positivism, a <em>born criminal</em>.&nbsp; Someone on <em>Dexter</em>'s creative team even seems to have read some Lombroso, as its star, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000HEVZBW/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Six Feet Under</em></a>'s Michael C. Hall, possesses the traits—called atavistic stigmata—the discredited Italian sociologist associated with born criminals.&nbsp; Compare:</p>

<p>Does Hall possess:</p>

<p>Lombroso believed born criminals like <del>Hall</del> Dexter should be identified early and civilized, civilized, civilized until they became productive members of society.&nbsp; So did Harry Morgan, as the viewer learns in an endless parade of <em>Father Knows Best</em>-flashbacks in which he schools Dex on social graces and the curbing of innate sociopathic urges.&nbsp; Hunt and kill <em>the deer</em>, the father says, and your bloodlust will be sated.&nbsp; As the years pass, the ritualistic killing of legal game slowly evolves into murdering those who deserve murdering, beginning with <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>'s <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000344/">Denise Crosby</a>.&nbsp; Crosby puts in a typically compelling performance as an &quot;<a href="http://www.kaiserpapers.org/medicalserialkillers.html">involuntary euthanasian</a>&quot; named &quot;Harry's Nurse.&quot;&nbsp; Crosby attempts to euthanize Harry against his will, Harry informs Dex that she can be killed, then Dex kills her.&nbsp; A vigilante serial killer is born.</p>

<p>The flashbacks in which the young Dex struggles to live up to &quot;Harry's Code&quot; are variously clichéd, unbearably clichéd and oddly moving.&nbsp; Shot with that lens Steven Soderbergh uses to create the illusion that the entire world is Mexico at dusk</p>

<p>...if you're outside and a press conference in the Seventies</p>

<center><img src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/erin6.jpg" /></center>

<p>...if you're not, unless you're brooding under this lamp:</p>

<center><img src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/erin8.jpg" /></center>

<p>By turns, the world of Dex's childhood is muted yellow and harsh orange with sickly green undertones.&nbsp; At first, the flashbacks offer a welcome contrast to the pastel vomitorium that is <strong>¡MIAMI!</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;But it soon becomes apparent that the muted colors and sickly undertones create a <em>moral</em> contrast between the life of young Dex—in which the born criminal must suppress or <em>tone down</em> his urges—and that of his adult counterpart, who lives as a productive member of society while <em>indulging</em> in them.&nbsp; The moral Dex, the one who controls his urges, lives a muted life.&nbsp; The immoral Dex gets to live his in glorious Technicolor.&nbsp; This contrast creeps from the past into the present as his relationship with Rita Bennett—<a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0004748/">Julie Benz</a>, best known for her own sociopathic turn as &quot;Darla&quot; on <em>Buffy</em> and <em>Angel</em>—evolves.&nbsp; When they confess to each other that their dream is to live a life of utter normalcy, they could be sitting across from Julia Roberts.</p>

<p>Telegraphing this distinction in a show ostensibly devoted to dramatizing the moral territory dividing Nature and Nurture threatens to turn the show into a revolving binary.&nbsp; If Dexter can flip from his natural to socialized self and back again, then Dex's narrated struggle—about which narration, more shortly—is largely ornamental, shutters on the window dividing inside from out instead of the latches allowing congress between.&nbsp; The show could easily become a familiar parable about the repression required to grease social wheels—Christian conservatives would flock to it were it to replace &quot;serial killer&quot; with &quot;homosexual.&quot;</p>

<p>That Michael C. Hall is best known for his portrayal of the closeted David Fisher on <em>Six Feet Under</em> almost compels the comparison be made.&nbsp; Hall, after all, is an actor whose charm largely consists of his inability to emote.&nbsp; Close your eyes and imagine he's talking about someone who's been killed instead of killing them and the two characters threaten to blend into the ultimate in Death Service Facilities.&nbsp; (<em>cue bouncy music and tweeting birds</em>)&nbsp; Located <em>Six Feet Under Dexter</em>, Michael C. Hall's Death Emporium provides all your killing and disposal needs under one roof.&nbsp; Someone you love deserve an early death?&nbsp; Drills bits are in aisle three.&nbsp; Need your inheritance sooner than you planned?&nbsp; Hacksaws, aisle seven.&nbsp; Recently lost someone special?&nbsp; Pick up a red courtesy phone and one of our trained grief counselors will happily talk you down from the ledge and into one of our award-winning begonia arrangements.&nbsp; <em>Just kidding!</em></p>

<p>Where was I?&nbsp; Nuance, yes, or the potential lack thereof.&nbsp; A promising premise does not a good show make, and if <em>Dexter</em> sidles up to that premise—focuses, to use its own implicit analogy, less on code-switching and more on the negotiation between mutually ignorant speakers—it may live up to its potential.&nbsp; But if Dexter transitions from himself into his father's creation as easily as his friends and superiors code-switch from English to (untranslated) Spanish, it never will.</p>

<p>(<em>This concludes the Saturday Night exercise in pointless television criticism.&nbsp; Stay tuned for next week's installment, in which we play &quot;Count the Crypto-Lesbians!&quot; with the <em>Law &amp; Order</em> franchise and decide which season of <em>America's Most Wanted</em> kicked the most ass.</em>)</p>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/measuring_the_d.html"><span><strong>Measuring the Drapes</strong> (x-posted from the Valve) Vis-à-vis some recent remarks, I feel compelled to ask: What do “taxpayer-financed ‘women’s studies’ caves” look like? Nice curtains or modified bed linens? Shelves clawed from the walls? Rows of unalphabetized feminist literature? Piles of New Yorkers from 1996 strewn about the floor? Why are all these feminist troglodytes so primitive? “Backwards”? What do you mean, “backwards”?</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/free_hegel_crit.html"><span><strong>Free Hegel Criticism!  Stop Selling Blue Jeans!</strong> (x-posted from the Valve) The first half of the title comes from a joke that made the rounds in the sabermetric community long before Michael Lewis’ Moneyball had been turned into an allegory of departmental hiring practices.* The idea was that sabermetric critics knew better than scouts, coaches, managers and general managers who should be on the field in a baseball game. Some players possessed skills—in particular, the ability to get on base—that sabermetricians thought criminally undervalued, so members of the sabermetric community would demand the “release” of these players via sarcastic email, newsgroup and BBS campaigns to “Free Such-and-Such!” Sure, Such-and-Such may clog the basepaths and be a butcher in the field, but his ability to get on base at a .390 clip—almost four times per ten plate appearances—means he contributes .31 more runs per game than that athletic-looking fellow over there. Besides winning, the reason Such-and-Such should be prefered over that athletic-looking fellow was, as the general manager of the Oakland A’s, Billy Beane, famously said in Moneyball, “We’re not selling blue jeans.” And so “selling blue jeans” entered the community argot, becoming the phrase of choice whenever a superficially sound argument, typically based on conventional wisdom, wrongfully imprisoned another Such-and-Such. Pace Bill’s post and another, by Chad Orzel a few months back, it seems that people increasingly want scholars in the humanities to sell blue jeans. Look how well it works in the sciences! Why don’t the humanities adopt a similar model? The answer to that question arrived, fortuitously, in the form of Joe’s conference paper on Hegel. By Bill and Chad’s criteria, Joe deserves a harsh sentence from a hanging judge, and yet… The paper is clearly written to be read aloud. It makes frequent concessions to the audience—foremost among them the way in which Joe defines his terms as he goes along. This may seem like a small gesture, but audiences have a tendency to drift when a contested term like “ideology” is dropped, undefined, into a talk. “Whose definition of ‘ideology’ is she employing?” they think as the speaker continues upon her merry way. Admittedly, this may be the sort of “intellectual throat-clearing and scene-setting” Bill opposes, but a certain amount is necessary when entering into some conversations. Joe’s conference paper accomplishes what we all wish all papers could—it incorporates throat-clearing and scene-setting into its body, such that the argument is worked through instead of being “crammed” into the last five minutes. So you know what I say? Free Hegel Criticism! *It—being the first half of the title—is also quite the terrible pun.</span></a></div>
