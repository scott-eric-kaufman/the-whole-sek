	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/panic_in_the_st.html"><span><strong>Panic in the Streets of Newark? or Hang the Fuhrer, Hang the Furher, Hang the Furher!</strong> Sometimes the historical record tells us nothing about what happened. Case in point: the &quot;panic&quot; incited by Orson Welle's 1938 radio play of War of the Worlds. Some claim that the panic is an institutional artifact, the result of Hadley Cantril's attempt to legitimize social psychology. That claim's misleading, however, as Cantril's 1940 study--The Invasion from Mars: a Study in the Psychology of Panic--was written under the aegis of the already extant Princeton Radio Project. The PRP, funded by a Rockefeller grant which may have been a series of laundered CIA disbursements, opened its doors in 1937 and many of its members--apparently everyone except Adorno--became ranking officials in the intelligence community after America entered WWII. So the odds of Cantril perpetuating the &quot;panic myth&quot; to establish social psychology as a science are slim. Why would someone with access to the halls of power need to establish his credentials? Nevermind. My mind swarms with visions of Creationists and ID proponents lobbying the administration for intellectual responsibility. But that's fundamentalists demanding the scientific community recognize the legitimacy of their &quot;science&quot; through political channels. They're lobbying the administration; Cantril and his fellow PRP'ers were sought out by the government because of the accepted legitimacy of their work. If Cantril has nothing to gain professionally by disseminating the &quot;panic myth&quot;--i.e. if it's not invented whole-cloth--then we're left to debate the degree of &quot;panic&quot; involved. Here's what we know: people didn't jump off buildings people didn't stand armed on front porches people did overwhelm the telephone circuits people did try to verify the truth of the claims (esp. in New Jersey) people did believe that the nation's response to the program had been widespread panic What this means isn't that the &quot;panic&quot; didn't occur, only that it fell somewhere between someone actually yelling &quot;FIRE!&quot; in a crowded theater (400 victims hoaxed) and the latest outbreak of mad-cow disease (all beef-eating Americans). What all three situations do point to is the power of adient motives. Adient motives influence people to believe with little evidence or logic what would normally be rejected as erroneous by common sense. The adient factors involved in the &quot;panic&quot; Welles caused would be, naturally, the general culture of unbelievability cultivated by the news filtering in from Europe. As Rabbi Jonah B. Wise, of the Central Synagogue on 652 Lexington Avenue, said in his sermon the week after the &quot;panic&quot;: Hitler has made a Frankenstein of himself and of Germany. Last Sunday night people in the whole of the United States were running away in panic fear from Adolph Hitler. His counterpart at the Congregation Rodeph Sholom of 7 West Eighty-third Street, Rabbi Louis I. Newman, concurred: The gullibility which masses of people showed concerning the radio broadcast gives a clear indication of the reasons why myths regarding races and religions are so easily believed. What this means is that, in the end, both the panic and dissemination of the &quot;panic myth&quot; is all Hitler's fault. It's directly his fault because the outlandishness...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/a_most_manly_an.html"><span><strong>A Most Manly and Anglo-Saxon Affliction</strong> I would be writing more, but I've had a painfully sore throat which has prevented me from even considering the production of speech. Spoken or written. &quot;Can a throat be so sore its owner's reluctant to type?&quot; I'd wager the answer's &quot;Yes, a throat can be that sore.&quot; The reason's more complicated than you might imagine. First, the owner of the sore throat must contend with History. Both &quot;sore&quot; and &quot;throat&quot; originate in languages unpronouncable to anyone afflicted with a sore throat. Were I suffering such soreness in 897 C.E. and had the unenviable task of requesting assistance from the local barber, the odds of actual communication would be long. The word &quot;throat,&quot; you see, derives from the world Old English verb &quot;to swell.&quot; I would demand he somehow alleviate the pain in my sore swelling and point vigorously to my throat. But &quot;sore&quot; also means &quot;inflammation,&quot; so the odds are I would point to my &quot;inflamed swelling&quot; with a redundancy almost designed to confuse and infuriate my barber who, after all, is only equipped to shave and slice. No matter how inflamed my swelling, I think my barber would be right to insist that there's no a damn thing he can do to alleviate it which won't also result in my death, his arrest, then his death. So this most manly affliction would've been painful to pronounce with recourse to only the rasp of Germanic phonemes; and even if I managed pronunciation, the odds of those phonemes cohering into an intelligible utterance are slim. But it's even more complicated still. When functionally deaf people write and type they often subvocalize. Linguists believe that this practice is the result of, well, the fact that unlike the members of the hearing community, the deaf have to learn to associate the phonemes on the page with the phonemes that they hear in order to reproduce them. When a hearing person learns to read, they associate the letters on the page with the sounds that they hear; when a deaf person learns to read, they associate the letters on the page with the hours and hours of endless toil in a speech therapy lab. I see the letters, but instead of hearing them inside my head I produce them, silently, with my mouth. I don't know why I do this, but it means that if I'm not careful I move my mouth and throat when I read and write. That folks is why writing with a sore throat hurts.</span></a></div>
