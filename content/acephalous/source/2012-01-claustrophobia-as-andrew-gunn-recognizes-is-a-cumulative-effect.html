        <meta name="description" content="(The continuation of the previous post which, like this one, is yet another one of those posts.) I was going to jump right into the episode of Doctor Who I'm teaching tomorrow, but due to a non-Whovian coup, I'm going to prove my point differently first. To that end, I asked my however many Facebook friends I have the following: Please name the five most claustrophobic films and/or episodes of a television show you've ever seen. If your nominee is chosen, I'll honor you by naming you by name in the post I'm going to write this afternoon. (Not much of an honor, but hey, it's better than nothing.) Patrick Slaven, Kyler Kuehn, Carrie Shanafelt and Gary Farber all recommended Das Boot, and since I own a copy of said film, Das Boot it is. Short plot summary: back when Wolfgang Petersen had talent, he directed a film about a German U-boat and its discontents, and because the majority of the film took place on the boat, it had plenty of shots that approximate the &quot;coffin shots&quot; I discussed yesterday. (Being stuck in a metal tube leagues and leagues below the sea is roughly equivalent to being buried alive.) But unlike the frames discussed yesterday—in particular, the awkward image of Reynolds in his coffin—Petersen relies on standard scaled shots to create a claustrophobic atmosphere for his audience. So long as the audience grants him the conceit that the men in his film live precariously in a long metal cylinder, he need not 1) employ conventional &quot;coffin shots&quot; nor 2) improve upon convention or go whole hog (as Rodrigo Cortés did in Buried). Petersen's audience knows that these men are confined behind a brittle shell of metal and will miles below the sea, so the enclosed atmosphere of the film is implicit. But that's not enough. As I mentioned yesterday, audiences key in to conventions in ways that subvert their effectiveness. A director can put a person in a closed coffin, but because so many have done so previously, the effect is merely communicative. The simple fact of being entrapped comes across, but the sympathetic feeling of entrapment doesn't. Das Boot is different. It lacks any of the obviously constricted shots and opts instead for a directorial ethos of tight framing (much as I discussed in my counterfactual Bones yesterday): That'd be a typical dinner shot. It lacks the ostentation of Reynolds in a coffin, but by framing this medium close-up as he did, Petersen's use of shallow focus indicates that there's little more to the room than what's seen here. Typically, shallow focus emphasizes a face (or faces) and blurs the unimportant background into a hazy nothing; here, however, the shallow focus reveals that the walls behind these folks abut them so closely that they can't be excluded from the shot. There's simply no way for them to be in focus and the walls around them not, which an audience will realize (even if it doesn't consciously understand) means that..." />

<p>That&#39;d be a typical dinner shot. It lacks the ostentation of Reynolds in a coffin, but by framing this medium close-up as he did, Petersen&#39;s use of shallow focus indicates that there&#39;s little more to the room than what&#39;s seen here. Typically, shallow focus emphasizes a face (or faces) and blurs the unimportant background into a hazy nothing; here, however, the shallow focus reveals that the walls behind these folks abut them so closely that they can&#39;t be excluded from the shot. There&#39;s simply no way for them to be in focus and the walls around them not, which an audience will realize (even if it doesn&#39;t consciously understand) means that these men are very close to their walls. (Or vice versa.) It&#39;s not a &quot;coffin shot,&quot; merely a medium close-up with a depth of field that reveals, in its entirety, how little there is to see. Stack a few hundred similar shots together and the claustrophobic intent of every director who&#39;s ever buried an actor for effect can actually be realized. Just to prove my point, here are some other shots from the film:</p>
<div class="photo-wrap photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef016761059e90970b" id="photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef016761059e90970b" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 500px;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef016761059e90970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Doctor who daleks2012-01-24-14h24m59s172" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef016761059e90970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef016761059e90970b-500wi" title="Doctor who daleks2012-01-24-14h24m59s172" /></a></div>
<p>That shot of the living quarters need not be perfectly centered in such a way as to create a frame whose composition is so damn mathematical as to be oppressive, but Petersen&#39;s got an agenda. Also:&#0160;</p>

<p>There are many ways to depict a man amongst his crew, but framing his head as Petersen has (in a close-up) and situating it in the composition against many other similarly framed heads limits the scope of the frame to this head and these other ones. The face, again, is in shallow focus and yet because every other head&#39;s within the depth of field the constricted effect is only heightened. Imagine watching a film composed thus for 209 minutes (if you spring for the director&#39;s cut): the knowledge of the predicament of the crew is augmented, visually and viscerally, by the manner in which Petersen frames them.</p>
<p>All of which is only to say that a claustrophobic effect isn&#39;t bound to a claustrophobic situation. Certainly, both coffins and U-boats lend themselves to a claustrophobic treatment, but the reason <em>Das Boot </em>succeeds where yesterday&#39;s episodes and films failed has nothing to do with the narrative situation. It&#39;s all about the mechanics of how such a situation is filmed.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I promise, I&#39;ll address this within the dictates of my class and discuss Andrew Gunn&#39;s direction of &quot;The Victory of the Daleks.&quot;</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e6096171970c-content"><p>Thanks for this.  On previous viewings, I had an easy time noticing how the actors evoked sympathy in me for their claustrophobic conditions, but I hadn&#39;t consciously keyed in to how the framing and other directorial choices contributed as well.  This is especially apparent in the shots you mention when they are contrasted with the shots when the crew are on land (or even simply on the surface).<br />
I think I&#39;ll have to watch this again soon.  To the Netflix queue!</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0163001ab4d8970d-content"><p><i>Moon</i> might be argued to be claustrophobic, but I&#39;m also in the tiny minority of sf viewers who felt that the plot situation made no sense whatever (they need a guy to take care of a station where he doesn&#39;t know that 9/10ths doesn&#39;t exist, which is all run by an AI, but the AI can&#39;t run a rover or the parts that man is allegedly there to do -- just wtf is the protagonist THERE, someone please explain to me? -- all this can be kept a secret, the economics make no sense, and on and on).</p>

<p>Digressive, but the movie is so highly and widely praised (in the sf field, at least) that I&#39;m a bit hot-buttony on it.</p>

<p>Sometime I&#39;d like to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Boot#Versions" rel="nofollow">mini-series</a> cut of <i>Das Boot</i>, which runs almost five hours (293 minutes).</p>

<p>An outdoor showing might be nice.</p></span>

<p>Watching it (on DVD, well after it had received all of the hype) I found myself wondering what I would have written about it if I&#39;d been a reviewer watching a pre-release screening. Ultimately I think I, too, would have strongly recommended it as a film to watch, despite it&#39;s obvious flaws, because it does some things so well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a bit of a Sam Rockwell fan, but I think his acting is remarkably good in the film.</p></span>

The camera spends a good deal of time closely tracking Nina through narrow, confined hallways, whether in her home or backstage in the theater.  We also see her navigating through crowds of people in New York City.  This &quot;boxing in&quot; underscores the psychological pressures Nina feels from her instructor, mother, perfectionism, etc.</p></span>

Representing claustrophobic situations on screen should be simple enough: you take a person, put them in a confined space, and then you bury them alive. Doesn't matter if they're Buffy (in &quot;Bargaining&quot;): Or Bones (in &quot;Aliens in a Spaceship&quot;): Or some character played by Ryan Reynolds (in a dull film I wish I hadn't seen): Each of those cramped shots communicates to the audience that, like Everett in O Brother, Where Art Thou, someone's in a tight spot. But that's the problem: it communicates the narrow confines in which the characters find themselves, but because the &quot;coffin shot&quot; has become so clichéd, it does so the same way that a sequence of reverse shots inside a car communicates that the participants of a given conversation are driving. Only the oblique angle of the shot of Reynolds comes close to doing what a &quot;coffin shot&quot; is intended to do: duplicate in the audience the claustrophobia felt by the character. (And it only does so because of the odd angle. Most the film uses more conventional &quot;coffin angles&quot; and is as enervated as the other shots above.) Point being: filmmakers are quite proficient at representing people in enclosed spaces and communicating that said people are feeling claustrophobic, but they're not nearly as accomplished at making the audience feel the confinement represented the on screen. From the examples above, it's obvious that two techniques don't work: 1) placing characters in an enclosed space for a short duration and 2) placing characters in an enclosed space for a long duration. The first falls victim to convention, whereas the second flirts dangerously with boredom. (I disagree vehemently with Ebert on the effectiveness of Buried.) But if acclimation to convention has vitiated the tools with which a director could cajole claustrophobia from the audience (and if said director's not interested in making a tedious stunt of a film), how can an episode or a film be claustrophobic? The answer is: holistically. By which I mean, burying characters for X-amount-of-claustrophobic-time won't cut it, because that still leaves Y-amount-of-non-claustrophobic-time acting as an atmospheric counterweight. The entire episode or film must be shot with claustrophobia in mind. To use the episode of Bones as an example, too many shots in the episode are scaled too long: Does this long shot feel claustrophobic to you? Of course not. It's a brightly lit long shot: the lighting (and depth of field) allows the audience to observe details in the fore-, mid- and background, while the scale assures the audience that there's plenty to observe in all those grounds. To think counterfactually for a moment, it's not that shot couldn't be made more claustrophobic. Had the director cropped out some unnecessary visual information: Still a long shot, but by focusing more narrowly on Agent Booth and the lab technician, the space on-screen seems more cramped. If those officers in the back were to scoot a few feet to the left, the composition of the shot would...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/01/they-can-mostly-hear-those-whistles-blowing-mostly.html"><span><strong>They can (mostly) hear those whistles blowing. (Mostly.)</strong> Juan Williams wrote a column on conservative dog-whistles in which he points out the obvious: The language of GOP racial politics is heavy on euphemisms that allow the speaker to deny any responsibility for the racial content of his message. The code words in this game are “entitlement society” — as used by Mitt Romney—and “poor work ethic” and “food stamp president”—as used by Newt Gingrich. References to a lack of respect for the “Founding Fathers” and the “Constitution” also make certain ears perk up by demonizing anyone supposedly threatening core “old-fashioned American values.” Conservatives are pouncing on the idea that “Founding Fathers” could be what Williams calls a “racial code word,” and admittedly, it’s his weakest example. (Though you need not be a Constitutional scholar to understand that everyone who signed that document was not only white but that many of them owned slaves.) The dog-whistle status of the public fellation of source texts is questionable, but Gingrich’s refrain about Obama being a “food stamp President” certainly isn’t. Because not only is it a dog-whistle, it’s a dog-whistle whose etiology is a matter of public record. According to a source of unquestionable integrity, on January 5, 2012 Newt Gingrich told an audience in Plymouth, N.H. that if he were invited to speak at the NAACP’s annual convention, he would accept and “talk about why the African-American community should demand paychecks and not be satisfied with food stamps.” Far from being an idiopathic charge arising from some haze of liberal thought, the connection between blacks and food stamps is present right there in the very words Gingrich said: NAACP + Food Stamps = Dog-Whistle This isn’t that complicated: Gingrich created a rhetorical situation in which any invocation of food stamps would signal to his intended audience that he was talking about black people. The fact that he dispels this notion is belied by the undercurrent of thought that gave rise to the equation in the first place. If he didn’t associate black people with food stamps, mentioning the NAACP wouldn’t have triggered a canned statement about food stamps. Conservatives may wish this weren’t the case—that is, they may want to talk about the rise in food stamp consumption under the Obama administration—but Gingrich has made it impossible for them to do so without invoking the racist undertones of his statement.</span></a></div>
