You have any idea how lonely it is? How dangerous? I would love to be upstairs, watching TV or gossiping about boys or — God, even studying! But I have to save the world. Again. Or: LOKI: Enough! You are, all of you are beneath me! I am a god, you dull creature, and I will not be bullied by – (HULK flattens LOKI by SMASH) Whenever one of Whedon’s characters starts to speechify like William Wallace pontificating about the theoretical possibility of Scottish independence, that character’s likely to find his or her authority undermined either by their own words or someone else’s actions.* Whedon telegraphs it to a man who proceeds to semaphore it at your face.

Establishing that something’s doing the dominating before actually showing it on screen has two effects: the first is to rouse our curiosity; the second, to remind us of what’s become obvious by now, i.e. that this family’s been burdened by an unknown and unspoken something for quite some time. Of course Don knows what it is, but to Sally, in particular, there’s just been this horrible presence that’s tainted her father’s relationships with everyone. She has no idea what it is, but this shot’s telling you here it is.

			<p>In my <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of-what-oh-really">first post</a> on “In Care Of,” I discussed the importance of the logic of the “Oh Really” sequence to the episode; in <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/06/mad-men-disappointment-in-care-of-convention">the second</a>,
 I not only proved that cowboy hats aren’t the new lasers, but also that
 Matthew Weiner is dedicated to creating pain by any means necessary, 
including undermining the importance of structural elements like the “Oh
 Really” sequence. In other words, my first two posts were about how 
Weiner creates tension via the visuals and sustains it by undermining 
the visuals that created it via the narrative. Most television shows — 
and most television writers — have a particular set of visual and 
narrative crutches they break out when they need to rouse their viewers.
 For example, Joss Whedon favors hackneyed speeches undermined by 
immediate circumstances:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>BUFFY: </strong>No, it doesn’t stop! It never 
stops! Do you — do you think I chose to  be like this? You have any idea
 how lonely it is? How dangerous? I would  love to be upstairs, watching
 TV or gossiping about boys or — God,  even studying! But I have to save
 the world. Again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>LOKI:</strong> Enough! You are, all of you are beneath me! I am a god, you dull creature, and I will not be bullied by –</p>
<p>(<em>HULK flattens LOKI by SMASH</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever one of Whedon’s characters starts to speechify like <a href="http://youtu.be/gr_OpFxCx-A">William Wallace pontificating about the theoretical possibility of Scottish independence</a>,
 that character’s likely to find his or her authority undermined either 
by their own words or someone else’s actions.* Whedon telegraphs it to a
 man who proceeds to semaphore it at your face. Which is why <em>Mad Men </em>continues
 to make for compelling television: Weiner and his writers are clearly 
aware of how they’re manipulating us and, like a great boxer, always 
slug us where we’re not expecting. Especially when they’ve established 
those expectations in a particular episode. In the last scene of this 
one, he combines the “Oh Really” sequence with its content-dependent and
 confessional opposite. To wit:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mad-men-in-care-of00123.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mad-men-in-care-of00123.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00123" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>He opens with this long shot of the Draper/Whitman family. They’re all clearly staring <em>up </em>at
 something, and because of the extremely high angle, seem to be 
dominated by whatever that something is. Establishing that something’s 
doing the dominating before actually showing it on screen has two 
effects: the first is to rouse our curiosity; the second, to remind us 
of what’s become obvious by now, <em>i.e. </em>that this family’s been burdened by an unknown and unspoken something for quite some time. Of course <em>Don</em>
 knows what it is, but to Sally, in particular, there’s just been this 
horrible presence that’s tainted her father’s relationships with 
everyone. She has no idea <em>what</em> it is, but this shot’s telling you<em> here </em>it is. But before cutting to this looming presence, Weiner thinks we need a refresher on how close this family is at the moment:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mad-men-in-care-of00124.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mad-men-in-care-of00124.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00124" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>These are the children. They’re together, but:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mad-men-in-care-of00125.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mad-men-in-care-of00125.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00125" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>They’re also apart from Don. Each slightly encroaches into the 
others’ shot, but for the most part, Weiner segregates the children from
 their father here. They may share the same physical space and be 
looking in the same direction, but they’re not seeing at the same thing.
 Don needs to tell them what it is they’re seeing — the narrative has 
become content dependent again. Which is why, before cutting to the shot
 below, Weiner has Don inform them that “This is where I grew up.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mad-men-in-care-of00128.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mad-men-in-care-of00128.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00128" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We’re looking at them looking at the house, not because we don’t know
 what it is, but because we don’t know what Don’s up to. Nor should we, 
because that’s not Don. Because this is the moment Dick Whitman’s chosen
 to pitch his life to his children. He’s spent a lifetime telling them 
the equivalent of his initial Hershey pitch, so he knows he needs to 
find something bold and unexpected to draw them into his story. And as 
with the Hershey pitch, he decides to go with the painfully unvarnished 
truth: the whorehouse in which he was raised. Weiner then switches to a 
first-person shot of some sort:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mad-men-in-care-of00129.png"><img alt="" height="282" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mad-men-in-care-of00129.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00129" width="503" /></a></p>
<p>Your guess is as good as mine as to whose perspective this is. I’d 
wager it’s Sally’s, for reasons I explain below and because in the 
previous shot she’s the one most centrally located vis-a-vis the stairs.
 But Sally still doesn’t quite understand what she’s looking at. This 
season has addressed the racial upheaval the late ’60s, but Sally’s 
experience with African-Americans seems limited at this point to a thief
 and her former nanny, so I doubt she has any real understanding of the 
larger situation. She seems to understand here, however, that her 
father’s trying to tell her <em>something </em>about race in America at the moment:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mad-men-in-care-of00131.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mad-men-in-care-of00131.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00131" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Because the camera jump-cuts to the small boy standing aimlessly on 
the porch. He’s meaningful — the jump-cut from the extreme to the medium
 long shot informs us that she’s paying particular attention now — but 
she doesn’t know what he means. She doesn’t understand how her father 
could’ve grown up in what her brother referred to as “a bad 
neighborhood.” So what does the child mean? For Sally, he’s some sort of
 living connection to her father’s past, but that’s a line of thought 
that she’s not prepared to handle. She can’t understand what this child 
could possibly mean. And so the final exchange is unspoken, but the 
reverse shots fit a familiar pattern:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/madmenohreally.jpg"><img alt="" height="1409" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/madmenohreally.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="madmenohreally" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I’ve tried to use the font size to demonstrate how, unlike the earlier incarnation of this sequence, at this point everything’s <em>deescalating</em>.
 This isn’t a drunken Draper building up to an inevitable bar fight — 
it’s a battered Whitman telling his children the quiet truth of his 
life. That it’s structured as a similar series of two-shots — with one 
character towering over the other — invites us to consider the 
differences between his encounter with the bar and this moment with his 
children. Foremost among them is that there’s <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of-montage-02.jpg">no personal space being violated</a>,
 although that’s a bit of a dodge because his other two children are 
standing between them. Or are they? Of course they are, as much was 
established in the establishing shot. But <em>they’re not in frame </em>because they don’t matter. Ages ago, I argued <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/03/mad-men-a-little-kiss.html">that <em>Mad Men </em>will be remembered as Sally’s show</a>,
 and this is one of those moments when I feel vindicated for doing so. 
Draper’s effectively gone at this point, but he left behind this broken 
shell of a man named Whitman and a precocious daughter whose future

<p>*Which is why I think the final season of <em>Buffy </em>was 
underrated. Critics became annoyed when Whedon let Buffy rehash Saint 
Crispin’s Day every episode, but that was the point: divorced from her 
ability to back them up, her words lost their argumentative power; but 
instead of finding ways to make them more meaningful, she just started 
to produce more of them, as if she believed that if she talked long 
enough she’d convince herself, and that once she convinced herself, 
she’d convince her troops. She failed, spectacularly, to do anything of 
the sort. It made for stretches of uninspiring dialogue, but that 
doesn’t mean it made for bad television.</p>

Not because of the acting -- though the fact that Richard Belzer's been going through John Munch's motions since 1993 has been obvious for about a decade now -- but because it's all exploitation all the time. Its bias is clearly liberal, but cruelly so, in that it manifests itself in the bodies of its victims: children, women, immigrants, non-whites, gays, lesbians, etc. But that only makes it worse, because I suspect that conservatives secretly love the show because it combines the victimization of marginal peoples with the systemic incompetence of the New York state police force and legal system. The world of L&amp;O:SVU is one in which white men frequently get away with doing terrible things to people conservatives don't consider people. Which isn't to say that I don't also watch it. When it's on -- and it's always on -- I can't stop myself. It's that terrible. Last night, for example, I watched an episode in which Big Boi was eaten by a pack of hyenas and Detective Stabler was shot trying to stop a man with a monkey in a basketball. Because as we all know monkeys in basketballs are clearly within the purview of the Special Victims Unit. But you need not watch any particular episode to understand its horribleness, because it's right there in the Riefenstahlian opening credits. To the images! This is New York City, where all the American crime happens. This helicopter shot shows you how many people are in it and, therefore, how much crime is likely to happen. Which is a lot. Or would be were it not for: This tough American woman detective. You can tell she's tough because she has her hands on her hips. You can't actually see that here, but the camera's going to pull back on this still image in a moment because this is action photography. Like in a documentary! With two notable exceptions -- which I'll get to shortly -- it's all panning and zooming on still images. It creates the illusion that you're going to be watching something along the lines of Ken Burns's Civil War, and in the distant past of 1990, when the style of the franchise's opening credit sequence was originally established, maybe you were. But L&amp;O:SVU is a far cry from those early episodes, so this here's a bill of goods. As is the first mini-narrative of the sequence: A close-up on the police line. A crime must have occurred! Fortunately, a still image of a speeding police cruiser is on the way: Will it get there in time? Will the criminal get away with it? He will not! The rapist has been captured! The residents breathe more easily. But wait! Just because he's captured doesn't mean he's been convicted. Might he not get away with the raping on a technicality? He will not! He and his raping hands are behind bars. The residents really can...</span></a></div>

Here's our take on &quot;Winter Is Coming,&quot; the serie's inaugural episode. I'm including links to the works I referenced and will have Steven do the same. Works SEK discusses: Game of Thrones - &quot;Winter Is Coming&quot; for Poor Will Game of Thrones - &quot;Winter Is Coming&quot; for Bran Game of Thrones - &quot;Winter Is Coming&quot; for Catelyn Stark and Jon Snow Game of Thrones - &quot;Winter Is Coming&quot; for Will and Bran Works Attewell discusses: Game of Thrones – Prologue (Will, Gared, and Ser Waymar beyond the Wall, and class inequality within the Night’s Watch) Game of Thrones – Bran I (the execution of the Night’s Watch deserter and the direpups, Ned Stark’s theory of personal power) Game of Thrones – Catelyn I (Catelyn brings bad news to the Godswood, Jon Arryn as hand and explorations into feudalism) Game of Thrones – Daenerys I (Daenerys meets her future husband, conflicting historical memories of Robert’s Rebellion) Game of Thrones – Eddard I (Eddard and Robert down in the crypts, Robert as Henry VIII, and the Wardens Cardinal) Game of Thrones – Jon I (Jon meets Tyrion and is super-emo, how GRRM exaggerates medieval bastardy) Game of Thrones – Catelyn II (Catelyn gets a letter from her sister, Catelyn’s political skills, the nature of the Hand) Game of Thrones – Arya I (Arya doesn’t like sewing, Westerosi Punnett squares and not jumping to conclusions) Game of Thrones – Bran II (Bran goes climbing, introduction to the Lannister Conspiracy) Video: Audio: You can listen to the above podcast here. Archives: Our very civilized discussion of the premiere (S03E01). Fancy-talking about “Dark Wings, Dark Words” (S03E02). Here we are blathering on about “Walk of Punishment” (S03E03). Don’t watch — because you can’t — us discuss “And Now His Watch Has Ended” (S03E04). The rudely interrupted first half of our discussion of “Kissed by Fire” (S03E05). The second half of our discussion of religion in “Kissed by Fire” (S03E05). In which we discuss “The Climb” sans spoilers (S03E06). “The Climb” with spoilers (S03E06). “Second Sons.” We has them (S03E08). Belatedly, “The Bear and the Maiden Fair” (S03E07). You’re all invited to an epic performance of “The Rains of Castamere” (S03E09). This is the end ... the end of Season Three (S03E10).</span></a></div>
