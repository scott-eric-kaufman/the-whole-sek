<p>A few hours of archival work later, I possessed the oddest of dissertation detritus; odd not because it won't be useful, but because it will.&nbsp; (Such tangents typically lead to lands tangential, the exploration of which is fatal to Normative Time.)&nbsp; Here is what I found:</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was an English family of &quot;Ferrers.&quot;&nbsp; A war happened, and either because of or in spite of it, these &quot;Ferrers&quot; were awarded the Earldom of Derby and the courtesy title of &quot;Stanley.&quot;&nbsp; Now wealthy and bored, these Stanleys started playing chess.&nbsp; Sadly, conventional chess failed to excite them, so they accessorized.&nbsp; Catapults being very fashionable in Fall 1254—everyone who was anyone had at least one Plague-Ridden Cow Corpse and Flaming Wicker Ball that year—the Stanleys decided chess needed one too.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&quot;The Catapult Gambit&quot; was born.&nbsp; But the <del>Ferrers</del> Stanleys could not allow the common folk to acquire a device powerful enough to launch small objects entire feet, so they hid it.&nbsp; &quot;Stanley Chess,&quot; as it was called, became the hobby of the gentlemen who played their chess in secret gentlemen's clubs.&nbsp; They held secret tournaments in England for hundreds of years.&nbsp; Eventually, one of them ventured to the New World, founded his own secret societies, and taught its members how to play Stanley Chess.&nbsp; They too held tournaments, local and national, the winner of which took home an ornate trophy which had been in the Stanley family for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>In 1892, one member of the Stanley clan, Frederick Stanley—possibly upset by the prominence of his cousin, Charles Henry Stanley, author of the first weekly chess column in America—decided that his family heirloom would no longer be awarded to the premier secret chess player in North America.&nbsp; So in 1892, he decided to replace brain with brawn, donating his family's treasured Stanley Cup to an amateur hockey league in Canada.</p>

<p>And now, you know, the rest, of the story ...</p>

<p>... only not really, as I left out all the information about how this fits into the dissertation chapter I currently slave on.&nbsp; (You are welcome to guess how it does, but I warn you: it has nothing to do with the popularity of chess in C19<span style="font-size: 0.6em;"><sup>th</sup></span> America; debates about the moral qualities chess created or corrupted; or the development of intellectual abilities which may or may not have been transmissible to one's children.)<br /> </p>

The roster is nothing short of spectacular: David A. Bell, David Bromwich, Daniel W. Drezner, David Greenberg, Jacob S. Hacker, Michael Kazin, Sanford Levinson, Jacob T. Levy, Darrin M. McMahon, John McWhorter, Elisa New, Steven Pinker, Eric Rauchway, Christine Stansell, Lawrence Summers, Cass R. Sunstein, Abigail Thernstrom, Ted Widmer and Alan Wolfe. I’m not entirely sure what its establishment means for the future of academic blogging. Does it bode well? Does it mean academic bloggers have already “made it”? How will these titans interact with established bloggers? Will they participate in discussions or will they merely initiate them? Over the past three years, I’ve corresponded with four of its contributors; all four struck me as personable, charitable scholars willing to engage their opponents. (A few months back, I heard Pinker was “stubborn, arrogant, uncooperative and chewed with his mouth open.” That description—sans flourish—didn’t jibe with my experience.) What effect will having to deal with trolls, sorrowful or otherwise, have on them? I’m as curious as I can be (without wishing it upon them). Also, everyone should check out Eric Rauchway’s post on Deadwood. In addition to being an exceptionally gifted historian—his Murdering McKinley: The Making of Theodore Roosevelt’s America is one of the finest books on my period (Gilded Age/Progressive Era) I’ve read to date—he has impeccable taste in links.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/09/almost_famous.html"><span><strong>Almost Famous?</strong> It is an ordinary morning. Scott wakes up, showers, downs a cup of coffee and unslumbers his laptop. The air conditioner in front of which he sits spews cool air and white noise. Scott: (to himself) Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, Eric Rauchway, spam, spam, spam—ERIC RAUCHWAY?!? (vigorously fans his hands in front of his face) The Eric Rauchway? (turns to bookshelf, removes Murdering McKinley from the shelf, stares the cover) Why I—I—I c—can't, c—can't hardly br—br—br—brea— (labored wheezing, followed by a dull thud as his head hits the keyboard) Time passes. Scott unslumps, looks confused, composes himself, replies to Rauchway's email and begins work for the day. The air conditioner continues blanketing his study with cool air and white noise. Scott is completely unaware of the Little Womedievalist as she enters. LW: (savoring the moment) Pack— Scott: (jumping seven startled feet straight up) Jesus Christ! LW: —age from Amazon. (exits) Scott: (gathering himself) What do we have here? Michael's What's Liberal About the Liberal Arts? Excellent. Just the thing I need to procrastinate. (opens book, flips to the acknowledgments page and reads aloud) &quot;I want to thank Timothy Burke, some guy, some famous guy, some guy, Ralph Luker&quot;—that's awful sweet—&quot;Christopher Clarke, Roxanne Cooper, John Holbo, Scott Eric Kaufman and Amardeep Sin&quot;—SCOTT ERIC KAUFMAN?!? (vigorouslier fans his hands in front of his face) ME Scott Eric Kaufman? (turns to mirror, looks at self, looks at book, points at self, points at page) Why I—I—I c—can't, c—can't hardly br—br—br—brea— (more labored wheezing, followed by a duller thud as his head hits the keyboard again) Five minutes later, Scott rouses himself, rereads the page, reacquires the vapors and faints again. Ten minutes after that, Scott rerouses himself, rerereads the page, rereacquires the vapors and faints again. Time passes. Seven hours later, the Little Womedievalist enters wearing a worried expression. The air conditioner still spews cool air and white noise. She looks at her husband, slumped over the keyboard, whispering his happiness in desperate, wheezy syllables and laughs, lovingly, at the foolish man-child before her.</span></a></div>
