<p>I simply felt the need to point out that, from my perspective, for any frequent reader of this blog, the use of sarcasm was more than obvious -- although I understand your justification, I would argue that the authors of those (eighteen angry) e-mails are the one that should question their interpretative skills, and such a justification was not required /per se/. I, for one, actually laughed aloud upon reading the original post. Further, would the use of sarcasm not imply a critique of these &quot;congratulatory responses,&quot; thus making any attacks directed towards your post misled?</p>

<p>(Parenthetically, speaking of e-mails, did you receive the one I sent yesterday?)</p></span>

<p>It doesn&#39;t help that, somewhere on the internet, there will inevitably be someone saying, with absolute sincerity, exactly what someone else is trying to write as an over-the-top critical parody...</p></span>

		<span id="comment-16084051-content"><p>Of course, I didn&#39;t mean my comments regarding the people who wrote the aforementioned e-mails to come off as insulting or disrespectful -- I rather meant to suggest that Scott shouldn&#39;t necessarily feel guilty about having written that post, since, perhaps, those people /should/ have familiarized themselves with the general content of the blog before contemplating the idea of sending an angry e-mail, supposing that the tone of these messages was indeed &quot;angry.&quot; That said, this assertation is potentially (almost ethically) judgmental of me.</p>

<p>Yet, what N. points out in the last paragraph of her comment is essentially true, and I had a similar experience with an old blog of mine, where I had written a ridiculously sarcastic parody of ethnic essentialism which generated what I would almost be willing to qualify as &quot;hate mail.&quot; And even though I saw the post as obviously sarcastic, the feeling I got when received these messages led me think that I shouldn&#39;t have assumed that the use of sarcasm was so obvious.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-16088211-content"><p>You&#39;ve done two things, both valuable: (a) deployed satire, which there&#39;s precious little of on this medium, and (b) flushed out some New Puritans, always ready to produce the infantile response of being affronted. (Isn&#39;t &quot;inappropriate&quot; the most weaselly of words in contemporary usage?)</p>

<p>Two exemplars pop into my &quot;mind&quot;.  The first is Randy Newman, who narrows the ironic distance between author and narrator to approximately zero (e.g. &quot;Christmas in Cape Town&quot;) and who got slaughtered for writing &quot;Short People&quot;, a superbly poised insult to racism widely interpreted as Shortism.  And the second is, of course, Swift.</p>

<p>Swift - for example in &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; - raises some interesting questions about sarcasm and irony. When I first read it (as opposed to talking about it) I was struck by just how little textual evidence of irony it offered. It would be perfectly possible to read it dead straight, unless one was aware of, or made assumptions about, Swift&#39;s own moral &amp; ethical position and the contemporary mise-en-scene.  (Hearken up, Derrida. Woo-hoo!, New Historicists.)</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t do the context, and you lack the imagination to make the assumptions about the author, you are of course going to be wildly affronted because <em>you will base your reading on your own preconceptions</em>. In which, as ever, the (New) Puritans reveal more about their own (anxiously unreconstructed) selves than about their interlocutors.</p>

<p>Bah. The blogosphere is pervaded by people who can&#39;t write addressing people who can&#39;t read. Altering - as you&#39;ve done = the first term in the equation won&#39;t alter the second. (So it&#39;s not an equation. (Insert obligatory critical theory to taste.))</p></span>

		<span id="comment-16091275-content"><p>Hmm -- &quot;deployed satire, which there&#39;s precious little of on this medium&quot;?  With all due respect to Michael, that&#39;s worse than an SSI, which is at least limited to a single person.  The form of satire in which one writes a wingnut paragraph and relies on the context of it being on a non-wingnut blog in order to make it into satire is not rare.  Michael can write something back about sense of humor and so on, but to me at least Swift&#39;s Modest Proposal would not have been great satire if there really had been pamphleteers of the time already writing about how we should eat Irish babies.  Writing that we should go ahead with a nuclear first strike on Iran in order to save civilization -- that would be sort of intrinsically dark humor, perhaps, but not really good satire at this point.</p>

<p>As for the rest, people routinely misinterpret tone over the Internet.  There was some recent study that I don&#39;t even feel like Googling that said that 50% of the time people misinterpreted the tone of a statement that the writer thought would be obvious.  So you can&#39;t really blame the reader.  You have to either write this kind of thing expecting angry Emails or resign yourself to putting in a statement at the end explicitly labeling it as satire.</p>

<p>I should have saved space by just agreeing with N. Pepperell&#39;s second paragraph.</p></span>
