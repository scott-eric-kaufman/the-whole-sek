<p>It seems strange for Miller to play jihad for a joke when he obviously believes it necessitates his adolescent diplomatic fantasy, but that&#39;s just another symptom of his declining mind. Consider this: the man who wrote and pencilled&#0160;<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563893428/diesekoschmar-20" target="_self">The Dark Knight Returns</a> </em>in 1986 decides to write and pencil another book about another Batman-type figure going to war against an invading army of blinkered idiots, only in 2006, he lacks the imagination required to have this Batman-type figure fend them off with anything short of an arsenal. What would Batman say to that?</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0153928de8dc970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Batman the dark knight returns weapon of the enemy" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0153928de8dc970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0153928de8dc970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Batman the dark knight returns weapon of the enemy" /></a></p>
<p>Moreover, what would Batman do with a horde of poor kids whose misdirected aggression has left them vulnerable to persuasion by a radical ideology? He would provide an alternative:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0153928de36a970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Batman the dark knight returns" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0153928de36a970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0153928de36a970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Batman the dark knight returns" /></a></p>
<p>Before you ask: that <em>is</em> Batman, on a horse, leading until-very-recently mindless terror-proxies in an attempt to save Gotham. Frank Miller in 1986 believed that the enemy wasn&#39;t only human, but capable of being redeemed; his 2006 counterpart, however, is having none of it.</p>
<p>After all, 9/11 Q.E.D.</p>

<p>I also think that Miller&#39;s work has always betrayed a conservative ideology. The Dark Knight Returns might have made fun of Reagan as a symbol of authority and a dunce, but its libertarian politics were within the Goldwater branch of the Republican party.  </p></span>

Is there a similar check on the bloodthirst of Holy Terror? That&#39;s what I take Scott to be critiquing, not just the conservatism in general. (See the Martha Washington books for more examples of conservatism--in that case Objectivism--ruining a Frank Miller product, and 300--which is basically fascistic--as another example of a conservative comic that still works.)</p></span>

While I have enjoyed some of his work in the past, I always leave the challenge and thought of this:  If Frank Miller is so great of a writer, why hasn&#39;t he ever written (or drawn) a female character as anything more than a 14 year old male&#39;s fantasy?  His women are either conflicting with the male, just to arouse him as a tease, or they are there basically pumping up how great the male character is... only to have both, archetypes of women to end up having sex with the main male character--or to be drawn in sexually suggestive pose.</p></span>

Looking at Sin City it occurred to me that all his female characters are either hookers, strippers, or dead. Tomenos has mentioned Martha Washington as a project ruined by Objectivism, but that aside, I think it also presents Washington as a strong female presence. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve read it, but I don&#39;t remember her being overtly sexualized. I&#39;m open to being proven wrong, however. </p></span>

I wasn’t really expecting that. The basic premise, for those not in the know, is Lex Luthor finds a way to essentially give Superman fast-developing cancer, leaving Superman to do a lot of bucket-list things: give Lois Lane the chance to experience his powers for the day; nail one last scoop for the Daily Planet; go back and visit the grave of Jonathan Kent, his adopted father; save the world one last time. However, the hallmarks of Morrison's work, according to renowned comic scholar (and Alyssa's occasional interlocutor) Douglas Wolk, are: reality-bending metaphysical freakouts dressed up in action-adventure drag; metaphors that make visible the process by which language creates an image that in turn becomes narrative; a touch of feel-good self-improvement rhetoric; faith in the the power of pop and popularity to do magic; and skinny bald men who are stand-ins for Morrison himself, heroically conquering sadness and making the world evolve. (Reading Comics 258) If those two descriptions seem at odds, that's because they are. Morrison is a talented but unintegrated artist. What do I mean? He can be as aggressively annoying as Wolk's flattering account of him suggests. Incorporating proxies of himself into narratives about the nature of narratives and claiming that magic makes these metaphorical selves visible? That is, to quote my advisor, pure &quot;postmodern gee-whiz wankery.&quot; It's cleverness for the sake of being hailed as King Clever, and it grates on my every last nerve because it's so clinical and intellectualized. AND YET. I came to graduate school to study the works of James Joyce, whose complex wankery far outstrips anything Morrison's attempted, much less accomplished. So why does Morrison bother me in a manner Joyce doesn't? The short answer is that, at his best, Morrison doesn't bother me at all. When is he at his best? As Alyssa notes, it's when he's stripped a story to its emotional core and presented its complexities not as worthy subjects in and of themselves, but as natural consequences of a human narrative. Of course, the protagonists of these &quot;human&quot; narratives are rarely human: in All-Star Superman, it's Superman; in We3, it's a trio of weaponized house-pets. That is to say: Morrison seems to have a problem elevating actual humans to a position worthy of simple human sympathy. A kidnapped pet or an orphaned alien are worthy of sympathy because they aspire to be more than their outsider status allows them to be. But an average human being? He or she is what he or she is—short of a magical authorial intervention that's as likely to land him or her in Sade's castle as provide anything resembling hope or help. The only transcendence average people can acquire is by proxy, e.g. Lois's &quot;acquisition&quot; of Superman's powers on her birthday. In short, I don't find in Morrison much in the way of human sympathy for ordinary...</span></a></div>

It's a harrowing experience, but useful in the extreme because it helps temper some habits that've become so fixed they don't register as extreme anymore. It's an exercise in becoming painfully self-aware of how one behaves in a classroom, and I'd recommend it to anyone who teaches ... and Rick Perry. Because there was this one time I was all hopped up on the caffeine before my session and I came into class and it went something like this: You start with a bang, hitting your buzz words, but you slowly peter out, start checking your notes, and begin rambling before rousing yourself momentarily as you prepare to crash again. It's a poor performance, hilariously so, but I can sympathize. It must be tiring trying to remember all that tripe.</span></a></div>
