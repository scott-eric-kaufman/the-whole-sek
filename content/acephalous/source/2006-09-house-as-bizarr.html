<p>I remember now.&nbsp; I wanted to point to the transition from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009WPM1Q/diesekoschmar-20">the first season</a> of <em>House </em>to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FVQLIO/diesekoschmar-20">the second</a> and its counterpart between the first and second books of Cervantes' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/039397281X/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Don Quijote</em></a>.&nbsp; The problem with my theory is that it depends on some creative mappings and convenient reversals to work.&nbsp; Still, I think the comparison interesting enough to deserve refutation.&nbsp; So here goes:</p>

<p>Readers of the <em>Quijote </em>are already familiar with meta-spheric movement between the first and second volumes.&nbsp; The first consists of a conventional romance, by which I mean, a series of adventures connected (slightly) by the central character who has them all.&nbsp; The second volume, however, propels the novel into the aforementioned meta-sphere.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In its prologue, Cervantes informs his readers that he will not, as expected, &quot;spit in the face of whoever wrote that second <em>Don Quijote</em>&quot;:</p><blockquote><p>I'm not planning on to give you any such satisfaction: it's true, insults may make even the humblest hearts thirst for vengence, but the rule will have to let me be an exception.&nbsp; You want me to call him an ass, tell him he's a liar, and impudent, but the idea has never so much as occurred to me: his own sin can punish him, he can eat it with his bread, that's that.&nbsp; (360)</p></blockquote><p>Only that's not that.&nbsp; <em>That </em>is the beginning of the modern novel, according to its most illustrious historians, Ian Watt and Michael McKeon.&nbsp; Not only does it saturate the second volume with Cervantes' awareness of romantic convention, it also initiates Quijote's own questioning on those conventions.&nbsp; If you think the <em>Quijote </em>a tragedy, this is the moment it turns tragic.&nbsp; Once the good knight punctures his fantasy, his mental adventures stop resonating historically.&nbsp; He begins a descent that's all the more devestating for its increasingly perfunctory quality.&nbsp; He desperately wants the scrim to drop again, but even when it does, its opacity has given way to a translucence he finds blinding.</p>

<p><em>House</em> inverts this movement from comfortable convention to cold, hard fact.&nbsp; In the first season, the eponymous Gregory House spends an inordinate amount of time watching a <em>General Hospital</em>-esque soap opera.&nbsp; Every time a character approaches him, his feet are propped in an unsanitary fashion on expensive medical equipment and he hushes his underling by demanding he wait until the next commercial.&nbsp; His obsession resembles the conventionally quirky tics which have peppered television for the better part of the past two decades.&nbsp; However, as the first season closes, what had been a straight-forward medical drama transmogrifies into a <em>General Hospital</em>-esque soap opera as House's ex-wife is hired by his hospital, the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hosptial, as its lead counsel.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Since 40 percent of the lawsuits filed are against House, this tightens their orbits unto collision.&nbsp; What makes <em>House</em> interesting—by which I mean, what makes this different from programs which begin with a bang but start shark-hopping before intelligent people can get attached—is that he reenacts the birth of the modern novel.&nbsp; He spends the first season compulsively watching soap operas in order to prepare himself for the soap opera his life will become in the second.&nbsp; His manipulation of interpersonal and departmental relations, so shrewd in the first season, seems forced in the second as he searches for a balance between the knowledge of melodrama he's acquired and the circumstances in which he's called upon to use it.</p>

<p>However, I've only finished half of the second season, so my epiphanic inkling could fizzle into so much senseless blather.&nbsp; But I don't think it will.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Why?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Because all my lip-flapping is less interpretation than description.&nbsp; </p>
