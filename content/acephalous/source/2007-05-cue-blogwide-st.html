But the only one I&#39;ve seen reach 500 was the highly annoying &quot;Blog&quot; comment thread on Unqualified Offerings.  That joke has been done -- into the ground -- so I don&#39;t know whether your chances of reaching 500 are that good.

(I&#39;m shameless in this matter, so that doesn&#39;t work on me.)  It&#39;s always easier to write less than write more.</p></span>

Imagine my job talk: Q: So what do you think the implications of this are for a Deleuzian discourse which rejects anagenetic in favor of a more rhizomatic cladogenetic theory of the dissemination of ideas in the body social? A: Off the top of my head, I'm not sure. I'll have our boys in the van look into it and get back to you on that one. To get back to topic of my talk, I think [many brilliant things about the impact of evolutionary theory on turn-of-the-last-century American culture, and I relate them for approximately five minutes] ... could the gentlemen who asked the question about Deleuze please stand up? So, one of the boys in the van is telling me that he wouldn't be so quick to align Deleuzian thought with cladogenetic accounts. He's saying cladogenetic and anagenetic accounts are often complementary, inasmuch as the changes of the frequency of traits within a population (anagenesis) is what eventually causes speciation (cladogenesis). He's also informed me that the word &quot;cladogenesis&quot; means &quot;the origins of branches.&quot; Tim McCarver: I did not know that. I would have said &quot;trees,&quot; but that would have to be seeds, which you plant in the ground. Amazing what boys can dig up in the van these days.</span></a></div>

(Deposit comments on this un-post here.) This is merely a reminder that, as the strike draws to a close, the 500th comment is still up for grabs. Remember, you can have me write about anything you so desire, so long as you're the 500th commenter. I'll post my criterion for inclusion in the final count when I announce the winner. In the meantime, Timothy suggests you post a link to the strike on some conservative blog. Because that would look like link-spamming, I won't endorse it ... however, if you want to write a little diatribe about how much you hate Jesus/Bush/Republicans/pants, post it in the comments then link to that.
