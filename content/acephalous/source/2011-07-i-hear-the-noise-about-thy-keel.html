<p>As a young adult, I only had one or two friends die, one of those was pretty tangential to the arc of my life, while the other was a closer friend but still not close enough that I didn&#39;t find out about his death until years after.</p>

<p>Now, they&#39;re starting to go, along with parents whom I knew and other older relatives of friends. </p>

<p>I can only imagine the thoughts going through your head, but I offer this: no one really dies so long as even one person remembers them and loves them. </p>

<p>Clearly you and Alan had a bond. For that, then, be happy and happy you have the memories you do. </p></span>

<p>It is hard to describe the bond that exists between folks who forged friendships in the early BBS days, back when being online meant 300 baud modems, busy signals and redialing the same board over and over. All I know is it sucks to lose someone that you&#39;ve matched wits with over and over, been allies and enemies with, fought along side of, and against. <br />

I&#39;m a hardcore libertarian who&#39;s been arguing with Scott for the better part of 20 yrs. now, and though he&#39;s wrong about almost everything, he&#39;s right about you.  You&#39;re an embarrassment to whatever cause you profess.  A zit on the ass of whatever ideal you champion.  You sir, are attacking an honest profession of grief with petty bullshit, and should be shunned for it.  You won&#39;t be, I&#39;m sure, as you&#39;re proof that the categorical imperative doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>And with that, I&#39;m done with you, as you&#39;re so far beneath me that I&#39;m pulling out my telescope and trying to spy you, but can&#39;t see a damn thing outside of the ants.</p></span>

<p>I&#39;ll see if I can turn up some of the pictures that I took of amazing natural areas within half a day&#39;s drive of L.A.  My advice, as before  -- and I&#39;m sorry that I&#39;m the kind of person who always gives advice when none is asked for -- is for you and your wife to see some of those places if you haven&#39;t already, get out of the citysprawl and especially out of the blogosphere for a bit, don&#39;t be concerned with what you have to write.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e89cc72de970d-content"><p>Donnie,</p>

<p>I can call you Donnie, right? After spending the better part of the afternoon acquainting myself with your blog and things that others have written about you, I feel that &quot;Donald&quot; is much too formal for old friends such as us. Yes, after a long stroll down memory lane via Google and the Wayback Machine, it feels like we practically grew up together.</p>

<p>So, Donnie. After reading the message above where you accused SEK of being an asshole guilty of posting &quot;insincere puff and inglorious piddle&quot; I *immediately* knew where you were coming from.</p>

<p>Of *course* you would think Scott&#39;s post is &quot;insincere puff&quot;-- since on the same day SEK was posting this obviously trumped-up message about his dead friend or whatever, you were busy posting the incredibly important story about Britney Spears&#39; latest fashion tips, which can only be honestly described as exactly the opposite of &quot;insincere puff.&quot; Thank god for you, Donnie. Thank god you are keeping the public informed about Britney&#39;s fashion tips. This is important.</p>

<p>And, Donnie. Of *course* I immediately understand why you don&#39;t like this SEK character. Lets start with the easy stuff--I mean, look at his blog with all its liberal nonsense. Big words, long, substantial posts which tend to produce much discussion and debate. It&#39;s almost like SEK&#39;s blog has a COMMUNITY feel to it. Yours on the other hand is done the way all true American-Fuck-Yeah blogs are supposed to be done; with blatant disregard of applicable Fair Use Law. You steal huge swaths of content from newspapers, throw up a few original sentences and some YouTube links to generate as much SEO and traffic as possible, and generate zero discussion or debate in the process. Fuck debate or comments, who needs that on your own site when you can go troll other people&#39;s sites and carpet-bomb them to hell and back with a good ole healthy dose of FUCK YEAH AMERICAN POWER WOOO HOOOOO, while at the same time linking back to your own site to generate as much controversy, and not coincidentally, traffic and revenue as possible. Throw in some half-naked women, and you&#39;re practically emulating the Fox News business model. FUCK YEAH!</p>

<p>Donnie, my man.I feel you. I really do, brother. If I were you, I&#39;d hate this SEK guy as well. From where I&#39;m sitting it seems like this guy is just a real asshole. I mean hell, despite using a photo of a much younger version of yourself, he still manages to soundly beat your ratings at RateMyProfessors. But fuck that guy, right? Who needs ratings at some stupid ratings site! He may have your scores beat, but what does that matter? All of your life&#39;s dreams have been fulfilled by being an associate professor at a community college. Gotta love how you have time to work full time at a community college and still post an average of 10+ blog posts per day during some months. You are JUST THAT GOOD.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve got everything you need-- a festering miasma of soft-core porn, voyeuristic gore, neoconservative fearmongering and plenty of time to troll the internet.</p>

<p>Fuck SEK! You&#39;re living the dream, bud.</p></span>

I'm still working on Seeing Rhetoric, but as the material I'm currently working on consists of revisions of the lesson plans I've already posted, I'm bereft of new material to post. As soon as I'm finished revising and back into the production of new material, I'll be posting it. Like everyone with a doctorate in English, I believe I have a novel in me, and the only time I can indulge in that fancy is during the summer. Those are the only three reasons posting has slowed to a crawl here and elsewhere, and anyone who says otherwise is engaging in what Twain once called &quot;wrong and damnable conjecture.&quot;</span></a></div>
