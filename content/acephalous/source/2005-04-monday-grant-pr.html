Beagle...in Sweets.</strong> Uncouth though it may be to mock earnest high school students who trace Darwin's voyage around the globe in brownies or cookies, I can't resist. I'm a horrible person for mocking a young mind who thought it &quot;scientific&quot; to draw Galapagos finches with cake icing. I'm a shit for laughing the efforts of one young man to construct a Galapagos tortoise from a pie and five cupcakes. Fortunately, I don't even know what to make of the H.M.S. Beagle &quot;pie.&quot; (Nor do I understand why the young lady felt compelled to shudder quote &quot;pie.&quot;) But what's really, really terrible is how I'm about to quote, verbatim, the &quot;poetic&quot; efforts of an anonymous student who, instead of baking, composed a tribute to Darwin in rhyme: Charles Robert Darwin was his name. The evolution theory was his claim to fame. He studied theology and received his bachelor's degree, from a highly noted school, Cambridge University. Darwin was a naturalist on a British expedition. To study plants and animals was his mission. The H.M.S. Beagle sailed far and near. Darwin found new animals in places rare. Darwin had a large collection of fossils. He knew that his finds were colossal. The fossils connected life old and new. And from this his theory grew. After studying his organism collection. He developed the theory, natural selection. Survival of the fittest was another name, for the natural selection game. The people of his time were shocked by his theory. Of humans from monkeys, they were wary. Darwin's theories impacted religious thought. And changed the science that was taught. Darwin lived until 1882, but his work is still studied by me and you.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/04/the_great_zulow.html"><span><strong>The Great Zulowski: Friend of Czars, Queens, and Originator of the Theory of Natural Selection</strong> All this time writing a dissertation on non-Darwinian evolutionary theory wasted! Little did I realize that even Darwinian thought is, technically speaking, non-Darwinian. I now have to run search-and-replace on everything I've written the past two years. &quot;Darwinian&quot; must become &quot;Zulowskian&quot;; &quot;non-Darwinian&quot; must become &quot;non-non-Darwinian,&quot; the first instance of which must now be followed by a long footnote explaining that this particular double-negative doesn't equal a positive, i.e. that &quot;non-non-Darwinian&quot; doesn't mean &quot;Darwinian&quot; in the way that -2 x -2 = 4. Cripes. All because Zulowski, as he attests in the Dec. 29, 1860 edition of Vanity Fair, right there on page 319: I was the originator of the theory of &quot;natural selection,&quot; which Darwin has so boldly put forth of late, that I am surprised to find he is English and not American. I published an elaborate treatise on the subject, seventy years ago, in the Polynesian tongue, with notes in Arabic. I have been unable to find it in any of the poorly furnished libraries of America. Zulowski, or as Longfellow called him, &quot;Count Zulowski,&quot; lived a life most of his contemporaries couldn't imagine. Sixty years ago next February, when Czar Paul was knocked in the head and strangled by a party of drunken revellers, so that Alexander reigned in his stead, if my advice could have been taken the bloody scene that followed (the fighting among soldiery) would have been prevented. Alexander said as much to me over a game of chess. I won the game, hence my hasty departure from Russia. If the first passage is pure Borges--who, having not been born in 1860, is not likely to have penned it--the second is pure Twain, who I'm inclined to think penned both. This is the only mention of a Zulowski in any of the historical databases to which I have access, and Google's turning up fuck all, so I'm left with one conclusion: Count Zulowski must have been a high stakes player in international politics who, having crossed Daniel Webster--who had offered him a position as West Point's top brass, a position Zulowski declined &quot;feeling that in a country where the army was naught, and the navy less, it would be below my merits and qualifications&quot;--having crossed, that is, Daniel Webster one time too many, had his name erased from the annals of American history.</span></a></div>
