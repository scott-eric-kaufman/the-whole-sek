<p>Something tells me these 6 kids were never students who knew you as a &quot;tough grader,&quot; Scott. And so the fact that they like you (if I&#39;m reading the implied logic correctly) may not indicate that <em>all</em> of your students liked you in spite of your tough grading. I wonder if you&#39;ve compared your evaluations with grades given?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve certainly noticed the correlation: the better the grades, the better my evals. (Of course, I&#39;d like to think that the grades entirely reflected students&#39; increased engagement with the class -- and that their liking me better followed reasonably from their being more interested in the material. But that, too, is probably more or less delusion.)</p>

<p>Anyway, happy first day to you weird quarter people.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-15812012-content"><p>You infer what I implied correctly: I&#39;ve uniformly high evalutions (although I&#39;m not <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=254703" rel="nofollow">universally loved</a>).  I do think the students in question would consider me a tough grader, however; I gave one of them a shock-her-into-shape C on her profile and she only ended up with a B+ in the class <i>despite</i> writing one of the most brilliant articles I&#39;ve had the pleasure to grade.  (About a conservative politician who wanted to be on Wheel of Fortune; ironically, the student ended up on Wheel of Fortune instead.)  All of which is only to say that I think people like me <i>despite</i> being a tough grader; the fact that I give them back a single-spaced page of comments on everything they turn into me doesn&#39;t hurt in that respect.  They may not like what I have to say, but they know that I take it and therefore them seriously to spell it out (in a constructive fashion).  I think that defuses much of the animus students acquire over the course of a quarter . . . on which topic, yes, it&#39;s insane.  When I first arrived here, fresh from LSU&#39;s semestrial haven, I nearly lost my mind.  Eventually, however, you adjust.  </p>

Yes I love everything I write about . . . but there's something else I love which I rarely mention. But today is opening day. (For the Mets.) So without further ado I present a picture of the tough-as-nails, more-masculine-than-a-bag-of-hammers man in whom I've invested my hopes and dreams and envious aspirations: The women swoon and the men, well, they swoon too when they see mighty David take the field. Sometimes he wows us with his barehanded theatrics; other times with his uncanny ability to keep his hands close to his body and drive the ball the other way; and others still with his unworldly work ethic and frightening intensity. (To any gay medievalists who fawn over Sir David while obliterating me in a distracted game of chess who are reading this: a picture of your favorite Met playing grabass with Nick the Stick. And to think some people have the nerve to call our beloved national past-time &quot;homosocial.&quot;)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/two_posts_about.html"><span><strong>Murglarizing American History the Reginald Kenneth Dwight Way</strong> Two posts about The Battle of New Orleans on one blog? Insanity! And yet: As I watched the underrated Elizabethtown recently, I made a mental note of the fact that Cameron Crowe has now had two films in which Elton John songs figure prominently. Like every kid who came of age after Say Anything premiered, I fancied myself &quot;a Lloyd&quot; and sought out heartbreakers so I too could hoist a stereo above my head and &quot;serenade&quot; my Diane with &quot;In Your Eyes.&quot; Alas! Instead I ended up heavily medicated in a tree outside my first love's window alternately bawling and asleep. (I had an excuse . . . and a head swaddled such that I had a gauzy half-leia thing going on. How could she have resisted?) But I digress. The Say Anything soundtrack—like its taste-making compatriot Singles —took pains to prove that despite being married to a founding member of Heart, Cameron had chops: Peter Gabriel, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Replacements, Fishbone, Depeche Mode, Living Colour &amp;c. Now that was a soundtrack . . . typical of a time and a place and an attitude I sheepishly emulated. Same logic applpies Elizabethtown. Right down to the Elton John song &quot;My Father's Gun.&quot; Lyrically the song is typical early '70s Taupin-penned bombast [.mp3] From this day on I own my father's gun We dug his shallow grave beneath the sun I laid his broken body down below the southern land It wouldn't do to bury him where any Yankee stands I'll take my horse and I'll ride the northern plain To wear the colour of the greys and join the fight again I'll not rest until I know the cause is fought and won From this day on until I die I'll wear my father's gun I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight To New Orleans well that's just fine alright 'Cause there's fighting there and the company needs men So slip us a rope and sail on round the bend As soon as this is over we'll go home To plant the seeds of justice in our bones To watch the children growing and see the women sewing There'll be laughter when the bells of freedom ring When I initially listened to the lyrics I thought them slyly brilliant. Taupin's narrator longs to head south and fight in one of the few major engagements unknowingly fought after the peace treaty ending its war had been signed. You know: &quot;The Battle of New Orleans.&quot; So we have the British-to-the-bone Reginald Kenneth Dwight inhabiting the voice of an American who wants to fight in a war already over because he hears &quot;the Company needs men.&quot; The Americans lost 13 and had 58 wounded; the British lost approximately 700 and had 2000 wounded. What would the Americans have done had Taupin not sent intrepid Elton to the rescue? Would fourteen have fallen? Perish the thought! Then I realized the talk of &quot;southern land&quot; and its partner-in-rhyme &quot;where any Yankee...</span></a></div>
