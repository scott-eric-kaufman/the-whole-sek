			<p>[<em>X-posted blah blah blah</em>]</p>

<p>As I browse through the catalogue for the upcoming MLA, I see that
there will be a number of unpleasant decisions to be made.&nbsp; All of them
boil down to: “Here or here?”
</p>
<p>Do I seat myself at promptly 10:15 on Wednesday morning at the panel
on “Citizenship and United States Writing” on which Brook Thomas, one
of my dissertator adivors, sits; or do I attend the special session on
“Covering Academe,” during which <a href="http://mclemee.com/id4.html">Scott McLemee</a>
will be discussing what it’s like to be “Outside, Looking In”?&nbsp; This
anecdote pretty much sums up the panic I’ll feel when I hit my hotel
room on Monday and try to decipher the highlighting schemes I’ve
concocted--yellow for “of interest, takes precedence over hunger,”
orange for “of interest, but doesn’t,” &amp;c.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
One panel contributors and readers of the Valve will want to attend is the one on “Walter Benn Michael’s <em>Our America</em>
Ten Years Later.” Presenters include Wai Chee Dimock, Kenneth Warren
(who spoke at Irvine last year and who I cannot recommend highly
enough), and our very own Sean McCann; Michaels himself will respond.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Quick questions of a more general nature: How many panels before you
burn out?&nbsp; (At the International James Joyce conference a couple of
years ago, I drove everyone, myself included, insane by attending three
panels a day for four days straight.&nbsp; I think that may cross the line
between “responsible” and “unhealthy.&quot;) What exactly is a “cash bar”? 
How do I get invited to all the best parties?&nbsp; Is dress “business
casual,” and if so, what exactly does that mean?&nbsp; Which David Lodge
novels should I re-read before attending?&nbsp; Or has Lodge been
superseded?&nbsp; Is it considered bad form to slip quietly out of the
Q&amp;A session, or is a convincing enough cough fit a better tactic? 
(I kid, I kid.&nbsp; If I left during the Q&amp;A session, I wouldn’t be
able to ask the question I’d spent the last half of each presentation
perfecting.)
</p>
<p>Finally, if you can think of any panels of general interest, feel
free to offer suggestions.&nbsp; I’m thinking “Web Logs as Witness” (Friday,
8:30-9:45) may interest may of us, since we think about the relation of
scholarship to blogs to community regularly.&nbsp; I’m tempted to forget,
temporarily, what I learned during nine years of speech therapy and
pull rank at the “Deaf Critical Theory and Practice” panel . . . but
then I remember that I’m a scholar, not a performance artist, and that
such a performance would be considered offensive.&nbsp; (Then again, had I
not written this, they wouldn’t have known about the corrective therapy
and could’ve mistaken me for the man I would’ve been without it.&nbsp; But
that, my friends, would be cruel.&nbsp; When I speak as I once spoke, I am
utterly unintelligible.&nbsp; One summer after I’d completed S.T., I
volunteered to help train the speech therapists at the unfortunately
acronymed LSD [The Louisiana School for the Deaf].&nbsp; They said that the
particular combination of what I heard vs. what I produced was one of
the most bizarre pronunciation schemes they’d ever encountered.&nbsp; But I
sound like Tom Brokaw now, so none of you need worry that you’ll come
down with a case of the “come agains” if we meet at the MLA.)

First, while undertaking the dread task that is sifting through the recent CFPs, I stumbled across this gem: CFP: Evolution in the U.S. - ASA 2006 I am seeking participants for a panel on &quot;Evolution in the U.S.&quot; for the 2006 American Studies Association Annual Meeting, which will be held in Oakland, California. This panel seeks to study the debates surrounding evolution from both historical and modern perspectives and to consider issues including, but not limited to, religion, race, region, free speech, sexuality, class, ethnicity, and popular culture. My own work focuses on the gendered responses to and ramifications of Darwinian evolutionary theory. Ideally, I would like this panel to include diverse theoretical, methodological, and thematic approaches to evolution; international American Studies scholars; and a mix of graduate students, faculty, high school teachers, and activists. This panel also seeks to encourage more discussion of science within the American Studies community. This may be the first ever CFP I can answer without having to tailor my work to the panel's demands. Huzzah! Second, my advisor wrote me back and said that the fact that I worked myself into this corner with London doesn't exactly fill him with confidence that things are going to turn out differently with Churchill and Mitchell . . . he thinks putting London aside and concentrating on Churchill and Mitchell for the remainder of the month a not terrible idea. So for the first time in what seems like this life, I can spend an entire day not thinking about Jack London. You cannot imagine how liberating it feels. (I anticipate returning to my 311 pages of notes with fresh eyes at a later date, mind you. But for now, I live free of London and his endless intellectual fad-mongering.) Clearly tomorrow will be the day when I turn outward and design to entertain y'all again.</span></a></div>

I want that furrow further worn with embarassing enthusiams. How do I propose to accomplish this? With gushing odes to objects and ideas which under normal circumstances don't warrant odes. As the title &quot;Odeman Extraordinaire&quot; appeals to my inflated sense of self-importance, and I figure at the rate of an ode a week I can earn it in less time than it takes most people to purchase a badly battered 1993 Chevy Corsica. (Recent experience indicates such a purchase requires more time than anyone considers reasonable.) Tonight I present the first installment of the Tuesday Ode, which I call &quot;Ode to a Faux-Tee&quot;: A face from nought, I dispatch this fool beard, From chin and cheeks I shade, altering measure; On jaw Norelco chopped at four, on chops it sheared At three. Forsooth admit this tonsure Chills a soul to Kelvin's absolute. But being that attractiveness to all Depends upon the trimmed, not hirsute mug Of one swashbuckling and &quot;cute,&quot; My &quot;shavéd&quot; face, displayed as at The Mall, Wears its whiskers like a thug. Oh for face of Pitt! or one which would Be coo'ed emetic never -the, nor -any -less, I offer booty, tho' be it understood All piratanical, but I digress. Oh that my jaw had animate jut, like Wayne, Of bone composed, mandibular success! This chin, my chin, recessed unto the pain; Unless expert manscape, causes stress. That I might strut and feel so masculine, I trim this faux-tee to a manly maximum.</span></a></div>
