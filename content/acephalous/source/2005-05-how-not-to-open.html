			<p>The discussion at <a href="http://thevalve.org">The Valve</a> keeps spurring memories of my erstwhile conversion to Church of Theory and Latter Day Feints in the Spring of '98.&nbsp; <a href="http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/ENGLISH/Staff/richter/theory.html"><em>The Critical Tradition</em></a> clutched to my chest,&nbsp; I would speak to anyone willing to listen about of &quot;Butler's fascinating essay,&quot; presumably &quot;Imitation and Gender Subordination,&quot; which at the time I felt &quot;the most eye-opening thing I'd read all semester, in that the perspective it offered me [was] so different from what I assumed the 'gay' perspective to be that I [had] a distinct urge to round up everyone I know who's gay and interrogate them.&quot;&nbsp; Very impolitic, I know, but at the time I only knew two verbs and &quot;intervene&quot; didn't work either.&nbsp; Also, I had spent the previous paragraph &quot;intervening in Irigaray's critique of male-dominated hegemonic practices,&quot; and too much intervention left the young A.

Cephalous.&nbsp; &quot;Whatever it is, I'm against it!&quot;&nbsp; I attacked&nbsp; every category of category, ranting about how, &quot;like other cyborgs, Pynchon's have their otherness written in/on their bodies,&quot; or how &quot;this bodily otherness&nbsp; is then incorporated into their cyborg identities, which deconstruct the wholeness implicit in the exclusionary principle at the heart of a binary conception of identity.&quot;&nbsp; I felt powerful.&nbsp; Who transgressed borders?&nbsp; I transgressed borders.&nbsp; Which ones?&nbsp; Why</p><blockquote><p>the whole body of lived social relations, since their identities are &quot;predicated on transgressed boundaries&quot;--between such terms as organic/machinic, man/woman, nature/culture, public/private, civilized/primitive, heterosexual/polymorphously perverse--boundaries which society considers inviolable.</p></blockquote><p>Before the workings of my radical mind &quot;all the formerly reliable oppositions/dualisms [were] destabilized and the identities constructed from them [were offered] up for reexamination.&quot;&nbsp; Then I discussed nouns and something I called &quot;the historical/social ramifications of analytic desiccation.&quot;&nbsp; This withering analytic tatooed shudder-quotes on the shoulders of 78% of available nouns, and so when I turned, predictably, to discuss &quot;how cyborg 'identity' in the form of 'information-processing devices' [worked] to further destabilize the 'post-colonial' environs of 1922 Sudwestafrika,&quot; is it any wonder I lost track of &quot;what&quot; I had &quot;argued&quot;?&nbsp; Was I still talking about &quot;a fundamental divide (in the Kantian sense) between a human understanding of the world and a knowledge of the world as it is&quot;?&nbsp; And had my &quot;argument&quot; evaporated before or after the chart in which I made &quot;the implications of this situation less confusing&quot; by categorizing everything as &quot;Raw Sferical Data Weissmann Transcribes Exists in the World,&quot; &quot;Raw Data Transcribed by Weissmann&quot; and &quot;Information Decoded by Weissmann under Wittgensteinian Dictates&quot;?&nbsp; I cannot answers these questions now, and suspect I couldn't then either.&nbsp; (Though I would've protested, loudly, repeatedly, loudly, repeatedly, and then rather loudly that your inability to follow my argument is your fault.&nbsp; Jackass.)</p>

<p>Why am I sharing this?&nbsp; On the one hand, it's because I was thinking about the vehemence of my position in the this week's discussion on the Valve.&nbsp; How did I come to distrust the suggestiveness of Theory?&nbsp; Then I remembered: A. Cephalous, you little shit, you penned &quot;Cyborg Identity and the Destabilization of Epistemological Boundaries in Thomas Pynchon's <em>V. </em>and <em>Gravity's Rainbow</em>.&quot;&nbsp; What frightens me about this document (excerpts of which will now lurk the darker corners of the internet until the most inopportune moment possible) is that I earnestly believed I was saying something about something.&nbsp; What frightens me more generally are those occasions when I stumble across articles seemingly no better than my honors thesis in academic journals.&nbsp; Granted, some of those critics undoubtedly walk the walk I only talked, but since none of them really talk all that better than I did, I wonder about the quality of their walking.&nbsp; </p>

<p>One final historical note: Seven months after completing my <em>opera mictilis </em>I officially forswore Theory in an essay on the current state of Hawthorne Studies.&nbsp; Why I forswore there instead of forswearing somewhere else or appropriate even escapes me. </p>

		<span id="comment-5424739-content"><p>There&#39;s a way in which that post could be read as an indictment of my faculty mentor, but it shouldn&#39;t be.  I had an excellent advisor who would, three years later, chair a panel at a Joyce conference in Trieste that my Canadian friend and I were on.  At dinner later that night, he leaned over to me and said &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re not so full of yourself or shit anymore.&quot;  </p>

<p>Given the monumental failure of the finished product, I could see why you&#39;d suppose him an incompetent buffoon.  But I think his comments, though unheeded at the time, paved the way for the swift conversion to the anti-muddle-headed position I still hold.</p>

<p>P.S.  My Latin looks wonky.  Corrections would be appreciated.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-5477535-content"><p>Well, you may have been a jackass, but boy could you problematize!  Funny, I faced an entirely different set of obstacles in my never-finished dissertation on zero-grade thematic presents in the early Indo-European languages, but I&#39;m just as appalled when its moldering fragments stumble out of a box I&#39;ve heedlessly opened and assault me.  &quot;The Greek evidence... the Sanskrit forms... As Sebastian Sitzfleisch said in <i>Indogermanische Forschungen</i> in 1889...&quot;  Aiieee!  Run away!</p>

<p>I tried to read Theory when I was working at an academic bookstore in a university town where the English majors couldn&#39;t get enough of Derrida, de Man, &amp; Co, but it fried my brain and I had to stop.  I respect your ability to understand it well enough to renounce it.</p></span>

I had a wonderful tutor for Irish Literature who once assured me I was bright enough to dispense with my propensity for fence-sitting. Which was good of him really because nobody else bothered to tell me before Honours year - or after.</p></span>

But why would you want to?  Your dissertation sounds splendid, and is evidently (vide this post) part of a longer ongoing project to problematize.</p>

<p>Second thoughts: why not Textus Mictilis, since as every lit-crit-enthusist knows &#39;text&#39; derives from the same root as &#39;textile&#39;, something woven or intertwined, and wool (such as might be woven or intertwined) was treated with urine ... actually there&#39;s a whole new thesis here.</p></span>

Cephalous will be listening to talks about the breakdown of communication in medieval Iberian literature. A little this about the Arabiya Movement in al-Andalus. A little that about Iberian translations of the Ausias March. She loves the simple, quiet beauties of medieval Spanish, the sensuous way its arabesques slip off the tongue, but soon enough she'll want to leave. Across the hall, maybe, or maybe across the campus. She'll flit from the room, then the building. With each step the cold will snap her delicate ears and bite her fragile lungs, but eventually she'll find him. She'll rustle through her purse and pull out her glasses, tortoise-shell, thin-framed, and stare at the sign. She's waited so long to see these words, longer still to hear them. Through the door she'll see him hunched over the podium, shuffling his papers, visibly nervous, nearly knocking over his water bottle once, then again. He clears his throat, and in a voice higher and thinner than she expected, he begins: &quot;The paper I will read this morning is 'The Icelandic Peace Corpse: A Socially Sensible Slaughter...'&quot; I intended to write a brief introduction to substantial commentary on the discussion, over at languagehat, about the High Icelandic language center (or Miðstöð háfrónska tungumálsins) and its manifesto. The connection? Mrs. A. Cephalous would love little more than to live in a world in which &quot;obsolete Old Norse vocabulary [is] ressurected.&quot; For A. Cephalous, former linguistics major, the main attraction is where that resurrection will be produced: the kenningasmiðja or &quot;kenning-factory.&quot; The author of the movement identified himself on languagehat as Jef Braekmans, and not only has he invented numerous &quot;modern kennings,&quot; he solicits visitors to the site to send kennings of their own invention to add the already impressive kenningaskra he's compiled. Here are some examples and literal translations. Entertain yourself and loved ones by guessing what they mean. Answers in the comments. haðarrúnir: &quot;the runes of the blind god Höður,&quot; illsviti Haralds: &quot;the bad omen of Harold&quot; ragnasveppur: &quot;the mushroom belonging to the gods, makers and rulers of the universe.&quot; þórsilmur: &quot;the sweet odor of Thor&quot; nornasáldin: &quot;the sieve of life&quot; Finally, I wanted to point out the oddly unscientific and antiquated definition of &quot;Viking&quot; in the Oxford English Dictionary: &quot;One of those Scandinavian adventurers who practised piracy at sea and committed depredations on land.&quot; The British, it would appear, still hold a grudge: 1838 Crichton, Scandinavia I. 176 Hákon commanded the intrepid Vikingr to be put to death. 1848 Lytton, Harold VI. v, A fleet of vikings from Norway ravaged the western coasts. 1864 [H.W.
