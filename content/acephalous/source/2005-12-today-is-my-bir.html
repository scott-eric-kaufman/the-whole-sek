What I want to do with this post is ask John an utterly friendly question because, although he and I have had some good conversations about this before, they have been marred by rather tragicomic miscommunication over ‘analytic philosophy’.

But I (very standardly) take Frege, Moore, Russell and Wittgenstein to be the ‘founders’ of analytic philosophy, as well as paradigm samples of the what the thing is like (with appropriate qualifications - e.g. no one else writes like Wittgenstein); whereas John has (very non-standardly) taken analytic philosophy to be a post WWII development. Specifically, he sees analytic philosophy as significantly contemporaneous with developments in the post-war professionalization of the discipline. I am happy to debate about that, but am not willing to use ‘analytic philosophy’ in such a way that paradigm analytic philosophers turn out not to be analytic at all. Humpty Dumpty is right about how you can mean what you like. But in this case it’s way too confusing. I am also somewhat suspicious of John’s habit of turning analytic-pedigree philosophers he likes into non-analytics, thereby immunizing his case from immanent critique by counter-example. But if he’s moderately careful, I’m OK with a little of that. I need to know whether John has come around to my way of thinking about who is and isn’t ‘analytic’. If he hasn’t, he should tell me now. The reason this is pretty important, above and beyond the desirability of transcending total terminological muddle, is that it touches a rather crucial question - nay, frayed nerve - of motive. From John’s first post: “The red meat here is McCumber’s claim that analytic philosophy became dominant in the American university in part because of McCarthyism. During the Fifties the various sorts of accusers seemed to have especially focused on philosophers, and a number of careers were ended. Because analytic philosophy was politically innocuous, it was less dangerous and became more attractive both to individual graduate students and to departments.” John adds, regarding on particular victim of McCarthyism: “I think that it’s reasonable to wonder whether Copi would have been so resolutely apolitical without the motive of fear.” Now I don’t mind this sort of speculation. Academic philosophy was a small enough ecosystem that any significant hit could well have generated path-dependence effects we are still feeling today. Also, so long as you get the ‘in part’ in there you are probably in the clear. Example: if I say ‘John McCumber’s thesis may be advanced in part out of ressentiment against the intellectual strength of analytic philosophy,’ who is going to disprove me? You see the point: you get that tainted drop in the mix and it can spread pretty far pretty fast. What bothers me, as you would guess, is that this ‘in part’ - if it is just allowed to sit there onstage by itself, performing solo - seems to amount to overlooking the obvious: Frege, Moore, Russell and Wittgenstein were not motivated by fear of McCarthyism (I’m taking this as a premise.) Later analytic philosophers who philosophized like Frege, Moore, Russell and Wittgenstein plausibly had like motives to those of Frege, Moore, Russell and Wittgenstein - i.e. the default presumption would be that they had similar perspectives, ideals, intellectual tastes and tendencies. So there is really no clear need to get all Fear Factored up about why people turn out analytic. Some people like the stuff. This is where, from what I have managed to lay hands on, McCumber seriously falls down. And it looks like another book John cites, Fashionable Nihilism, falls down similarly, if the review he links is to be believed. You really can’t convincingly diagnose analytic philosophy as due to fear and McCarthyism, or even professionalism on stilts, without considering why Wittgenstein and Russell and co. found this style of thinking attractive. Getting back to John’s preference for defining this lot out of the set: if you do that, you avoid the motive problem. But it just isn’t plausible that the post-war stuff can be decoupled from the pre-war stuff. Obviously John wouldn’t dream of denying the genealogical link. But I take it he wants to maintain a morphological distinction. Post war stuff is very different in character (or differently motivated?) than Russell and Wittgenstein and co. I don’t think that view is supportable. I harp on this in part because, so it seems to me, you get this a lot. A standard variant is the Derrida interview option. (You can get a longer but rather typographically odd version here.) They philosophize as if nothing has happened. And so, there is perhaps in their resentment against deconstruction a certain bad conscience before a philosophy that asks the question of Europe ... So, it must be emphasized that disinterest in the Holocaust often co-habits in American academic culture, probably for reasons of a bad conscience, with a prosecutorial attitude towards the least offence committed by European intellectuals, as the de Man or the Heidegger affairs have revealed, that is to say that the Americans, who were basically strangers towhat happened in Europe, well, far away, American intellectuals and professors are often de-politicized, unlike many European intellectuals, they are shut up in their academic institutions, and they don’t have any space for political intervention ... Derrida is pulling a Hope-Tipping in the context of the De Man wars, which tried to pin Nazi associations on deconstruction by proxy. He is understandably irritated at analytic philosophers, in particular, being disrespectful to him. But the fact is: it’s silly to assume that analytic philosophy is caused by bad conscience about the Holocaust, because that is certainly not what attracted Russell and Wittgenstein to it. Why assume that later analytic philosophers do not, broadly, share the motives and perspectives of early analytic philosophers? Isn’t this possibility worth considering? The polemical game is, of course, to presuppose that your opponent’s position has no positive attractions, then busy yourself clinically tut-tutting about what trauma could have led to this patent disorder. I hope I love polemic as much as the next man, but part of loving it is not actually being fooled by it. One of the complex ironies of this particular polemical stance - broadly shared by McCumber and Derrida, I don’t know about Emerson - is that it is rather ahistorical in its understanding of analytic philosophy. (If I were a Hope-Tipping man myself, which I am, I would say with a straight face that what separates analytic philosophers from Hegelians is that the former tend to have highly sophisticated historical views, but you would see through that ruse quickly enough.) As I was saying, I don’t mean just that no one could be horrified by the Holocaust or fearful of McCarthyism as early as, say, 1905, when Russell wrote “On Denoting” - “that paradigm of philosophy,” Frank Ramsey called it. I also mean there is a tendency to pretend no one could possibly find an abstract, ahistorical, Platonic-minded (if you will) approach to philosophy positively attractive. You presuppose this could only be a feeble shelter from one’s own failure of existential nerve. Put it that way, and the objection to this presupposition has already been called by its proper name. In their rationalism and scientism, the early analytic philosophers are among the most orthodox of footnotes to Plato. Serious attempts to treat historical views as of the philosophic essence have to wait until Hegel, give or take. You can think what you like about ahistorical rationalism in philosophy, but making noises about needing McCarthy or the Holocaust to explain how such a view could gain currency is either disingenuous or parochial, mistaking post-Hegelian thought for the range of genuine intellectual possibility. To put it another way, McCumber and Derrida are deeply Hegelian in their approaches. But analytic philosophy is a rejection of Hegel. A very considered one, since Russell and Moore were taught by Hegelians (of an oddly potted, British sort.) They didn’t arrive at an ahistorical conception of philosophy by accident or out of fear. They were rebels on its behalf. For what it’s worth. Final note. It is interesting to compare and contrast broad-bore critiques of analytic philosophy and Theory. I am not too concerned about being wrong-footed here, because my position is that the possibility of general critique should always be freely granted. Trying to pretend the target doesn’t exist, for example, is a tedious waste of everyone’s time. But it is true that you have to be a bit careful. By the by, my old grad school colleague Josh Dever has an interesting project, a philosophy family tree, which currently contains 6501 philosophers, including myself. Here is my descent (which treats getting your highest degree as a reproductive sex act with your main advisor, which is a bit kinky, but - eh): Holbo, John Sluga, Hans Dummett, Michael Anscombe, Gertrude Wittgenstein, Ludwig Ramsey, Frank Russell, Bertrand Ward, James Lotze, Hermann Weiss, Christian Hermann (Wittgenstein ends up descended from Ramsey, even though Ramsey was younger, because Ramsey signed off on the Tractatus as W’s thesis. Most peculiar case.) So I have the same ancestor as Heidegger. Kinda neat. Heidegger, Martin Rickert, Heinrich Windelband, Wilhelm Lotze, Hermann Weiss, Christian Hermann It’s funny. I don’t know a thing about Christian Weiss except that, googling around, it seems that he maintained that philosophy and the history of philosophy are separate disciplines. Which goes to show even Heideggerians have this in them. Oh, and getting back to John Emerson: I’ll bet he’ll say I didn’t say enough about his Deweyan ideals. In fact, I am very sympathetic. But I wanted to clear up this ‘analytic philosophy’ stuff first. Also, I have a complaint about that really historically wild Barbara Johnson preface to Derrida’s Dissemination, which John Ransom has been praising. What’s that about? But I’ll save it for another day. Comments I prefer philosophers who don’t descend from Frege and Russell. (I even count Husserl as a descendant of Frege, wrongly; I’m not a “continental”.) I have very mixed feelings about Wittgenstein. I know nothing about Moore, though I suspect him to be to blame for the second-ordering of ethics. Back in the day I actually liked Ryle and Austen, but their tendency seems to have diminished in philosophy and to have gone into sociology and psychology. Wittgenstein is a very mixed bag and I like him mostly because of his non-analytic weirdnesses. Toulmin started as an analytic but feels that he was rejected, though I can’t document that from here. I don’t believe that I’ve appropriated any other analytics to my cause. Defnition-wise, I have also been accused of using too broad a definition, rather than too narrow. Some say that analytic philosophy proper lasted from 1955 or so to 1980 or so, and was destroyed by ??Davidson?? ??Quine?? The definitions of schools are essentially-contested, and are sometimes banners of belonging and sometimes polemical smears. During the fifties and sixties a wave of depoliticization and scientization swept through many academic disciplines, and many contemporary academics are fastidious about avoiding political engagement and popular writing, and contemptuous of anyone who behaves differently. I’ll post again, but I do not object to the very existence of analytic philosophy, but to its dominance. My objections to analytic philosophy itself are to: 1) the preference for second-order writing, 2) the reluctance to write for non-specialist audiences, 3) the fussy claims to a rigor which is attained at the cost of a crippling limitation of scope 4) refusal of political and ethical engagement, and 5) a preference for past-oriented descriptive, analytic writing over future-oriented, synthetic, constructive writing (several separate points which are closely related). I do not regret the loss of synthetic philosophy a la Hegel. By and large I am not a “continental”. While I regret the lack of writing for general audiences, I do not wish that philosophers would write inspiring self-help books or ideological manifestos. By John Emerson on 03/01/06 at 11:35 AM | Permanent link to this comment As far as the origins of early analytic philosophy, Popper, Wittgenstein, and the logical positivists seemed to have been motivated by the intention of defining a language of discourse on a scientific basis which would be rigorous enought to rule out a lot of the ideological writing which the objected to. Europe between about 1890 and 1930 was washed with all sorts of looniness (at least as bad as the American Sixties), some of it purportedly scientifically based (e.g. Spengler)—along with a lot of other more sensible stuff which claimed to be scientific but wasn’t (Toynbee, perhaps). Wittgenstein in particular seemed to object to all attempts, including humane ones, to find truth-value in ethical or political principles, though what he actually wanted is seemingly unknown—I follow Toulmin on this. The problem with the attempts to purify language is that they not only ruled out loony extremist ideology, they made any kind of primary ethical or political discourse difficult. I think that McCumber made too much of McCarthy specifically. The “end of ideology” promoted by Popper and Daniel Bell was the real turning point, and along with this came a move toward specialized technocracy throughout most of the university. By John Emerson on 03/01/06 at 11:52 AM | Permanent link to this comment I really don’t think anyone says analytic philosophy lasted from 1955 to 1980, so I just won’t let you use that one. You can’t make me! It is possible to maintain that analytic philosophy ended in about 1960 if you want to understand it as having been killed by Quine. (Quine wasn’t killing anything as late as 1980, although he was hanging on OK.) Your objections look to me like statements of preference or, if they really are supposed to be objections, somewhat question-begging. This isn’t the worst thing in the world, but I think your approach - through the ditch of McCarthyism, courtesy of McCumber - doesn’t really help you much. The second-order thing I’ll sort of give you. But I worry that it doesn’t come to much more than the thought that academics, after a while, tend to get their heads stuck in some cloud or other. Analytic philosophers are funny in this way, but I’m honestly not sure why you would pick on them as funnier than the others. (But do laugh, by all means. Good heavens, get it out of your system.) It’s just that the fact that this complaint was very eloquently made by Aristophanes militates against blame being lodged too squarely against McCarthy. The limitation of scope is pretty much supposed to be a feature, not a bug. It’s a hard one to referee because - well, this goes to the point that you aren’t really saying anything is wrong so much as suggesting an adjustment to the ecosystem. You could hardly have generalists without specialists for the former to work their welcome generalizing upon. If everyone is a generalist, you just have a gaggle of dilettantes, albeit potentially ethically committed. As to political and ethical engagement: do you find it really so problematic that Russell sort of separated his specialized philosophy and his general political activism. I’m not sure that’s such a bad model, really. Do you really want to advocate activism as a primary mode of operation within the context of a professional teaching environment? I find that sort of dubious. As to writing for non-specialist audiences: I guess I don’t feel that there is such an awful lack. Quite a few authors seem to me to do OK in this vein, though there should be more. Returning to the specialization issue: I feel this myself. That it turns into dry, boring scholastic twiddles suspicously quick, and I wish it wouldn’t. But the intellectual impulses that produce this seem to me very hard to fault in general. You start with some reasonable thoughts and methods and you end a raving scholastic. It’s a problem. I’m not sure that just objecting to the endpoint tells you how to break the cycle. Dewey ... I just wrote a review of a new book by Hilary Putnam, “Ethics Without Ontology”. The latest bend in the Putnam river is full-on Deweyite Pragmatism. But it seems sort of thin so far. Partly this is a problem with the analytic route by which Putnam arrives. It seems to completely burn itself up as fuel, leaving one with the impression that there was no particular advantage to figuring out why Quine was wrong. Better just to IGNORE him and going straight to Dewey. On the other hand, Dewey and his ‘intelligent approaches to practical problems’ does not seem to me distinctively philosophical, although I like the guy alright. I sort of feel that this way lies many more Matthew Yglesiases. Which is something I think is really good. A general sort of rationalism let loose on practical policy questions. An experimental, fair-minded spirit. Matthew Yglesias seems to me like a fine example of a philosophical intelligence let loose on talking sensibly about practical problems. But are we supposed to stock our departments with folks like him, rather than with folks like the ones who taught him, i.e. analytic philosophers? By John Holbo on 03/01/06 at 12:12 PM | Permanent link to this comment I meant ‘burn itself up as fuel, without actually getting you anywhere’, so you might as well have just walked to Dewey - who isn’t that far out - if that’s where you are ultimately supposed to be.

Honest. When I say “analytic philosophy” I primarily mean “whatever it was that took control of American philosophy during the fifties and sixties, and whose hegemony was unsuccessfully challenged around 1980”. I’ll call it “banalytic bilosophy” instead, if you want a more specific label. As always, I don’t abject to the presence of second-order ethic, for example, but the seeming lack of interest, or refusal, in first-order ethics. David Velleman came along right on time with an example of what I meant, and it was on his relevant political blog too. On Russell, I very strongly regret that he didn’t continue what he started with his book “Power: a Social Analysis”. He was trying to do public philosophy of high quality, but his book was ignored. Most of his other stuff seems journalistic and second-rate to me. (A possible successor of Russell here was Ernest Gellner, who I believe was a Popperian too. Steven Lukes and others of his students have done a lot of interesting stuff, but they’re almost all British. He would count as an analytic, but not as a banalytic, since he rejected the later Wittgenstein and followed the “big-picture” style of Popper, who was a transitional figure.) By John Emerson on 03/01/06 at 12:27 PM | Permanent link to this comment And my first comment crossed with John’s second, so - in blaming him for proceeding through the ditch - I hadn’t yet heard him say he didn’t like the ditch so much. But if it’s ‘end of ideology’ technocracy you object to, why blame the analytics? That’s a much more general movement. “The problem with the attempts to purify language is that they not only ruled out loony extremist ideology, they made any kind of primary ethical or political discourse difficult.” I agree with this, actually, but I don’t accept the form of argument. If you really want to address these issues, you have to think more about how these folks thought themselves into these positions, rather than just saying the results aren’t palatable. (If you are already sure what the right answers are, you don’t really need phiosophy anyway, and if you aren’t, why so much negative judging of analytic philosophy for ending up in the wrong place?) By John Holbo on 03/01/06 at 12:27 PM | Permanent link to this comment &quot;4) refusal of political and ethical engagement,” John Emerson, do you consider Rawls to be an analytic philosopher or not? Just wondering. By Rich Puchalsky on 03/01/06 at 12:32 PM | Permanent link to this comment The analytics were part of something bigger. Elsewhere I’ve also gone after neo-classical economics. It’s all over the place. One thing at a time. I should have said “impossible” rather than difficult. If anyone insists on criteria for primary ethical discourse which would make it impossible, I’ll just reject them out of hand and go on without them. If they claim to be able to prove that primary ethical discourse is either unnecessary or bad, the ball’s in their court. Wittgenstein is very interesting on ethics, but as it stands his writing on this topic is so incredibly confused that what he says can only be stimulating or suggestive. By John Emerson on 03/01/06 at 12:36 PM | Permanent link to this comment Rawls and Nozick seem to be the exceptions, if there are any. In Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature Rorty claimed that nothing that Rawls wrote required or assumed analytic philosophy. If Rorty was right, Rawls would be an original source then, not dependent or part of what came before. How engaged was Rawls? I tend to agree with John Gunnell: &quot;Although John Rawls’ A Theory of Justice (1971), as well as what many consider to be its ideological and philosophical counterpart, Robert Nozick’s Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974), could be construed as alluding to or reflecting, or in some way speaking to or about, politics, they were distinctly contextless works written by professional philosophers which lifted the perennial debates about liberalism and the ground of values to a new level of abstraction while apparently allowing academic commentators to believe that they were actually saying something about politics.&quot; (John Gunnell, The Descent of Political Theory, Chicago, 1993, pp. 272-3.) By John Emerson on 03/01/06 at 12:41 PM | Permanent link to this comment I don’t really understand what you want when you say you want academic philosophers - in their academic capacities - to be ‘engaged’. Writing about current events? Erecting barricades? Both? Neither? By John Holbo on 03/01/06 at 12:48 PM | Permanent link to this comment Writing about political topics in the context of the issues of the day, and more important, looking at the world in a broad sense and trying to discern what the important issues are and bring philosophical insight to them. There’s a very strong tendency to abstract political discussion from anything concrete and contemporary, and in many cases to abstract discussions from any concrete reality or history at all. By John Emerson on 03/01/06 at 12:56 PM | Permanent link to this comment Well, the Gunnell quote, even if you agree with it, only refers to _A Theory of Justice_—not _Political Liberalism_ or _The Law of Peoples_. But really I think that you’re trying a time-honored rhetorical device with Rawls: redefine any group to not include the people who have the characteristics that would falsify your criticism. Refering to Rawls as one of the exceptions, as if he’s one out of an equally representative thousand, is just a bit comic—after all, on the “That Was Then” thread, there _A Theory of Justice_ is at number 12. By Rich Puchalsky on 03/01/06 at 12:57 PM | Permanent link to this comment I don’t especially like Rawls, but if there were more Rawlses, I might not be saying these things. I have mixed feelings about Gellner and his people too, but if there were more people like them in the US, I’d probably feel differently too. At one point the people whining about the American analytic-philosophy stranglehold included the Popperians, believe it or not. Popper helped bring the present situation about, but he was a big-picture guy and didn’t fit well into the analytic mold. By John Emerson on 03/01/06 at 01:05 PM | Permanent link to this comment oops--that’s synthetic a posteriori. two things, however humble: do you mean to suggest there are alternatives to scientific materialism (which QUine upholds fairly consistently, with some platonic considerations perhaps) and denying the analytic/synthetic divide. Emerson is I believe a mystic at heart and all of this is sort of a ruse to put forth some new age or cypto-idealist view. By y on 03/01/06 at 01:33 PM | Permanent link to this comment Frankly, given its goals, Left2Right seems like a justification of my idea that analytic philosophy isn’t very relevant to actual politics. I followed their thread on relativism awhile back, and it seemed terribly thin and far off the mark. By John Emerson on 03/01/06 at 02:07 PM | Permanent link to this comment No, it’s relevant. You are again sort of thinking that AP is separate from scientific materialism. AP is generally the clarifcation of language; it’s meant to make sceintific language more precise. It’s really not so poetic or grand as say Nietzsche or Hegel and that is one reaosn why lit. types detest it, I believe. The symbolic language, quantifiers, predication, etc. are not about metaphysics; it’s about precision, and yes verification-- language and semantics as essentially mathematical. The metaphysical claims or entailments are secondary. There is, say in the Tractatus, a denial of platonic essences (in some sense the Fregean abstract objects are NOT some essential aspect of AP). Language is thus referential, not “meaningful” per se; (empiricism itself a neglected part of AP). And what could be more important than logic and empiricism to some sort of reasonable politics? There is always to Emerson’s writing this idea that somehow empiricism has failed, that some quasi-mystical approach to politics and reality must replace it. That is not the case. THe problems are not with logic or empiricism; instead there is not enough attention to data, and verifying various claims about data: we need more biologists and chemists and empirical psychologists and far fewer armchair philosophers or artistes: or at least philosophers should have an interest in the physical sciences, in real ugly situations such as the oil business or commodity markets. There are no magical solutions to the oil crisis or transportation or corporate tyranny or housing insanities in LA and SF; nor are there dogmatic solutions via marx or xtianity or Hegel, etc. By goof on 03/01/06 at 03:16 PM | Permanent link to this comment Analytic philosophy also seems to be irrelevant to mental health issues. By John Emerson on 03/01/06 at 03:27 PM | Permanent link to this comment Actually, while I think it is true that Derrida is responding to the analytics with a little tu quoque-ism, the question of the institutionalization of analytic philosophy does have to do, I think, with politics. There’s a book by Phillip Morowski—Cyborg Dreams—that is writen in an absurd style, but that follows up his geneology of neoclassical economics with a very dense history of the “strategic” turn in economics—with the John van Neumann, the Rand corporation and the Cowles commission in starring roles. One of the things about Mirowski is that he appreciates WWII’s effect in creating command and control mechanisms and embedding a game theory mentality into organizations. It is hard not to think that something similar was happening in philosophy. We have learned to think of analytic philosophy as the linguistic turn—but I think a case can be made for thinking of it as the strategic turn, in tandem with the silent slowing off of old models in economics (those having to do with classical mechanics) and the new armature of game theory. If analytic philosophy turned the pursuit of truth into a set of strategies—and I think it did—we can start understanding the real political import of analytic philosophy. There’s a suggestive coincidence between the technical academic support given to the Pentagon’s management of the Vietnam war, Quine’s own support for that war, and Rawls’ Great Society liberalism which should speak to historians who wonder why, as the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. developed a nuclear capacity and engaged in atom bomb testing that actually brought civilization to the brink of annihilation several times—and that was actually intended to, as a strategy—no American philosopher seemed to notice. Or, if they did, it was merely to teach Rand kids how to play with ever more sophisticated strategies. Surely there is something here to look at. Mirowski is interested in the conjuction of Neumann, Turing, and the introduction of new models, via Rand and the Military, into economic discourse. I imagine there are treasure troves there for the right philosophical geneologist. By roger on 03/01/06 at 04:19 PM | Permanent link to this comment oops. Sloughing. Sorry. By roger on 03/01/06 at 04:20 PM | Permanent link to this comment I think that the effect of the 50s wasn’t to make the university right-wing, but more to make it apolitical and technocratic (methodology instead of ideology). Many analytic philosophers and many of the RAND technocrats were far left politically by American standards. A lot of the supposed treason in US government came when Americans in government became overly sympathetic to our WWII Soviet and Red Chinese allies. So there had to be a switch in 1948, and rather than switch to a rightwing anti-Communist ideology, in the university at least the switch was to technocracy, neutrality, objectivity, etc. That way there wouldn’t have to be a second switch when we changed alliances again (e.g. Nixon-China). By John Emerson on 03/01/06 at 04:32 PM | Permanent link to this comment INteresting, but this all hangs on an assessment of WVO Quine’s politics, sir? what about Lord Bertie? He was anti-’Nam, as were some other AP types. If this is merely politics how about JPS and Simone De Beauvoirs’ hangin out with the maoists, Pol Pot in paree with some of the postmods (possibly Foucault), the de man thing, or the postmods and that maoist rag Quel Tel or whatever for comparison. There are no moral “facts.” By goof on 03/01/06 at 04:33 PM | Permanent link to this comment Russell had an extraordinarily complicated political trajectory. Apparently he was a pretty hard-core anti-Communist after WWII. Being an anti-Communist per se was OK, BTW. By John Emerson on 03/01/06 at 05:11 PM | Permanent link to this comment I think goof put his finger on it. The difference between analytic philosophy pre-war and post war is all about the politics of Russell, Carnap, Neurath, etc—all sterling socialists. The institutionalization that came, post-WWII, forgot that history. I’d rather disagree that the Rand types were leftwing. There was, aas Mirowski points out, a left wing—there were the Oppenheimers and the Norbert Weiners—and a right wing—the Tellers, the von Neumanns—and oddly enough, where these two parted company, in terms of economics, was over competition vs. efficiency. Competition, the old legitimizing theme in liberal economics, was supplanted (the way Mirowski tells the story) by efficiency, with the right forging an alliance between state that devoted immense sums to the military while adhering officially to a nostalgic standard of the smallest possible state and the justification of large corporations to fill out places in the capitalist economy as brokers of the most efficient markets. There was, in fact, intense debates between Hayek and Oskar Ryszard Lange, a Polish socialist who developed an economics in which small enterprises had more space to compete under socialism than under the efficient markets model. All of which is a tangent. Sorry. The larger point is that, just as economists substituted efficiency for competition as the justification for free enterprise, analytic philosophers substituted infinite formalized epistemology—sciences of strategy—for the generalist tendencies of the earlier analytics. An excellent book (not one that is consonant with my thesis, but that contains some supporting material) is Alberto Coffa’s pretty magnificent The Semantic Tradition from Kant to Carnap : To the Vienna Station. By roger on 03/01/06 at 08:12 PM | Permanent link to this comment I’m reading Mirowski. “Left-wing” would mostly be from an American perspective, and only for some (either in the RAND group or in analytic philosophy.) I find Mirowski hard to read, not exactly because he uses a lot of technical terminology, but more because he doesn’t. In other words, he refers to fairly difficult concepts of game theory or economics on the assumption that you pretty well know what they are. It’s easy to read, but hard for a non-specialist to understand. Lots of fascinating stuff, though. By John Emerson on 03/01/06 at 08:29 PM | Permanent link to this comment Roger, I disagree with a lot of that - “infinite formalized epistemology - sciences of strategy”, for example. For one thing, I don’t know what that means. For another, if I did, I suspect I would find that Russell’s theory of ramified types put him on the infinite side, thereby refuting your view. (Really I’m just hoping the troll will say ‘Russell’s ramified type theory’ so I can Fudd him again.) Basically the point about how some analytics are political activists and socialists and others aren’t just goes to show: analytic philosophy itself neither mandates nor precludes this sort of thing. So trying to get an angle on analytic philosophy from this political angle seems to me confused. That is to say, the ‘difference between pre and post war analytic philosophy’ you see seems to me like the difference between analytic philosophy in LA and in New York. Namely, it’s nothing really to do with the PHILOSOPHY. If you want to be a political activist, but you find analytic philosophy to be the most sophisticated, compelling sort, be a politically activist analytic philosopher. Where’s the obstacle? HINT: the problem is that there is a tendency to regard attraction to analysis as a character flaw, hence training in analysis as cultivation of character flaws. But look at Russell. Did writing Principia Mathematica keep him from thinking big thoughts? Not really? The ‘analysis is a character flaw’ move is just part of a common polemical strategy. By John Holbo on 03/01/06 at 09:01 PM | Permanent link to this comment I don’t think that analysis is neutral between political involvement and uninvolvement; I think that it tends against involvement. And it does so in part because of its method, which makes it difficult to make usable first-order statements about political issues. I remember when Rorty mentioned in one of his books that philosophers don’t get appointed to big-issue committees on things like welfare reform, that I dreamed up the Pythonesque scenario of an other-minds debate breaking out. If analytic philosophical methods were applied to political concepts and issues by someone with a deep involvement in the politics and the history involved, and if the philosophical tools were customized to the political work at hand, I could see value coming from that. But the stuff I end up reading always seems to begin by abstracting the discussion from concrete contexts right from the start, and carrying on a schematic and usually hypothetical discussion from there. The empiricist (or historical) idea that understanding profits from abundant contact with the data seems to be denied by analytics. Incidentally, at Kotsko’s blog Dominic Murphy recommended a few books for me to look at to change my mind, and I’d be willing to be given the names of a few more. By John Emerson on 03/01/06 at 09:18 PM | Permanent link to this comment Actually, John, I think the last part of your reply contradicts the first part—that Russell thinks ‘big thoughts” is what I was saying, no? And that the institutionalization of philosophy leads to the Gettier problem being a philosophy job multiplier is, uh, sorta my point. Jerry Fodor seems to find a dividing mark in the last fifty years too (http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n20/fodo01_.html). If you read about poor Carnap’s last years in American universities, the whole encyclopedic endeavor of the Vienna school—and it did not chose to call itself positivist for nothing—is drained off in technical and, I would say, strategic questions. What does somebody else know about what you know? I’m certainly not blaming analytic philosophy. That would be pointless, and besides, I like analytic philosophy. Besides which, really, if you compare, say, Tarski’s effort to find a way to purify truth from any semantic impurity and the way Heidegger (like some character out of Moliere) kept trying to find ways of saying Sein (Seyn, or maybe Seyn barred) that were divested of any meaning in life world around him, I imagine the set of motives here are pretty close. Which would make sense—really, I have doubts that two completely different philosophical schools would spring up in two close cultures, sharing a politics, an economics, and a common history. When you say, “trying to get an angle on analytic philosophy from this political angle seems to me confused,” I am not really sure why that should be more confusing than trying to get an angle on, say, economics or climatology from a political angle. If you don’t think the latter can be done, look at the controversies roiling NASA right now. You might not want that to be the case, but that is not a claim about social reality, that is a claim about what you would like philosophy, or climatology, or cybernetics, or whatever to be. By roger on 03/01/06 at 09:43 PM | Permanent link to this comment ROger of LI shows up and humiliates even the great minds of the valve eh. There may be an issue about reductionism. QUine, like his pal skinner, was rather eager to dispense with much; positivism (and its stepchild behaviorism), does have political consequences, and Quine’s pro-Nam stance should be considered in the context of his anti-&quot;mentalism&quot; and opposition to any sort of traditional philosophy, and dare we say, humanist thinking. perhaps Russell’s own reluctance to embrace strict empiricism and physicalism had something to do with his political views… hows that Johhny H., (sp. frauduli berkeleynanicus). By goof on 03/01/06 at 09:47 PM | Permanent link to this comment Roger, I’ve only got a few minutes before running off to teach. I’ll qualify one point: per the post, mostly what I’m objecting to is the rhetoric of only saying ‘perhaps this is in part due to professionalization’ and then not following it up with any other ‘in part’. I don’t deny that professionalization suited analytic philosophy, and this probably had something to do with its ascendancy. The point is more that the ideal of analytic philosophy as specialized attack on little problems is not only clearly prior and independent to the move to professionalization; it is also due more to Russell’s influence than anyone else’s. Which, given Russell’s character and professional situation, should be sufficient to establish that it is possible to find this view positively attractive. ‘All the Big answers are wrong. We need small answers.’ It isn’t the case that it only looks good if you are professionally deformed. This is shaving the point fine, because really what I am objecting to is a rhetorically illegitimate presentation of a point that, properly presented, deserves serious consideration. Fair enough. What the political angle doesn’t give you is any critical angle on the VALIDITY of the analytic point of view, but I think Emerson (and certainly McCumber) are sort of reaching for a way of critiquing the validity of the analytic point of view. “Roger of LI shows up and humiliates even the great minds of the valve eh.” Roger isn’t trying to humiliate me, that’s a different game. (pats goof on the head. cute kid, but not exactly the brightest klieg in the ballpark.) By John Holbo on 03/01/06 at 11:00 PM | Permanent link to this comment Mr. Emerson occasionally seems to hint at, intentionally or not--as do some of the postmod bloggers-- at teleology. (and delete this Herr Holboe if it offends ye). Heidegger produced a lot of muck but his Question Concerning Technology raises some interesting questions in regards to the “telos” of technik (and one might read it without subsribing to his thought in toto). That’s not to suggest that Hei. has the right answer, but he does at least suggest that techne is not in itself valuable. The QCT is not simply criticizing technik because it is instrumentalism, but seems to suggest (in a somewhat Hegelian manner), that technik came into being, and is perhaps not completely consciously willed or intentioned--.There is sort of an issue there regarding the purposes and aims of science, of technology which I don’t think many AP types addressed (tho CS Peirce did write on some related and somewhat Hegelian issues--his “syncretism&quot;--but does not seem to establish any sort of valid philosophy of history or progress--maybe that’s process philosophy to some degree, yet proc. phil would seem to need some type of foundation in teleology, and perhaps in probability---) Perhaps someone like Mr. Roger could flesh it out better. By phudd on 03/01/06 at 11:15 PM | Permanent link to this comment But the fact is: it’s silly to assume that analytic philosophy is caused by bad conscience about the Holocaust, Yes, it certainly would be. By Matt on 03/01/06 at 11:55 PM | Permanent link to this comment OK, I’ll bite. What do you think Derrida’s argument is, Matt? By John Holbo on 03/02/06 at 12:11 AM | Permanent link to this comment It would appear that analytic philosophy and literature have at least this in common: critics who insist it should stop being what it is--namely philosophy and literature--and become something else instead, namely politics. If you don’t really care for works of literature or works of philosophy that aren’t finally ways of “intervening” politically, then why not just leave them alone and go do politics? By Dan Green on 03/02/06 at 12:13 AM | Permanent link to this comment I think Daniel is sort of right. John Emerson writes: “I don’t think that analysis is neutral between political involvement and uninvolvement; I think that it tends against involvement.” But this is trivially true of everything except PURE involvement. If you have a conception of philosophy on which the proper way to do it is not terribly politically engaged, although you yourself are a political activist, it is no good complaining that this way of doing philosophy is not properly engaged. (I don’t think it is right to dismiss politically engaged philosophy out of hand, because that might indeed be better. But the fundamental philosophic question is not ‘is this sufficiently politically engaged?’ but ‘does this make sense, is it insightful, perceptive, wise, intelligent?’) By John Holbo on 03/02/06 at 12:37 AM | Permanent link to this comment Dan, because a lot of the philosophical tradition was political. Locke, Plato, Mill, and Dewey all wrote major works which were at least as political as they were philosophical. Plenty of others wrote works which were philosophical but also political. The little dividing lines you allege are figments of your obsession. I do not demand that all philosophy be politically engaged, but I think that some should be, and I think that philosophy would be improved, philosophically speaking, by more political engagement. By John Emerson on 03/02/06 at 12:37 AM | Permanent link to this comment John, not that. You’ll be delighted to hear that I’ve partly restored the original comment thread to Dylan’s post (Haloscan still had some of it). That discussion left me dissatisfied, however; I may try to say why exactly at some later point. Dan, For what it’s worth, I think the example of Sartre (which you implicitly caricature) is a plague (if you’ll pardon the pun) of sorts, unduly lingering and afflicting perceptions, even dignifying what are otherwise merely common prejudices. But then a lot has happened in the world of letters since then, though you wouldn’t know it from the BBC’s philosophy series, &amp;c. By Matt on 03/02/06 at 12:40 AM | Permanent link to this comment Dan, what critics are doing that? Because you argue that a certain way of doing philosophy in a certain system of institutions is political doesn’t tell you that it should be politically one way or another. When, in fact, a corpus of knowledge—what you should know—is shaped by a set of philosophers in a certain way for students of philosophy, they are simply doing politics. They might also be doing science. The two aren’t incompatible. John, huh, I don’t read Russell’s career like that at all. In fact, I’d say the opposite—that Russell stopped doing philosophy because, in part, it became a series of technical problems. Russell’s willingness to stretch himself out—to contact behaviorists and economists—was in the best British liberal tradition, and I don’t think he understood or appreciated what happened after the war. The excitement went out of philosophy. And I think he did not like what he saw of Wittgenstein’s latter period partly because he didn’t like the whole notion of the language game. But I guess this depends on something you don’t accept—that there was a qualitative change in analytic philosophy after WWII. Who knows, maybe it was all happening in 1920 and 1930, but I doubt it. I have read a lot of your average philo journal articles from that time on JSTOR, and they seem very different from the articles in the same journals in the 50s. I might be wrong. I’m no Russell expert, for one thing. Phudd, I think the odd non-career of process philosophy—an outlier, although its roots in Whitehead’s stuff should be impeccable - is one of those problems in the history of philosophy that I bet I could fit into my sketchy little schema, given world enough and time. On the other hand, I gotta get to bed. By roger on 03/02/06 at 12:45 AM | Permanent link to this comment Matt, the comments don’t seem to be showing when I click the link. I would have linked to your thread if it had still existed when I made the post. I do think it was a very, um, DISsatisfactory thread, doomed to have no THERE there, given the starting point. I honestly don’t know what you think Derrida is arguing, but I really think it is very odd to try to rest any weight on what is, transparently, irritated snark from bottom to top. It’s an interview. I’m not going to hang the man for talking smack, off the cuff, about people who clearly irritate him. But he is. By John Holbo on 03/02/06 at 12:52 AM | Permanent link to this comment The comments have been elevated to the post (the link, again). It is just an interview, you’re quite correct. You deny that Derrida, John McCumber, and John Emerson have anything on this topic on which to rest any weight? Oh, and I am a descendent of Bakhtin. By Matt on 03/02/06 at 01:04 AM | Permanent link to this comment Roger writes: “In fact, I’d say the opposite—that Russell stopped doing philosophy because, in part, it became a series of technical problems.” Russell, at all stages of his career, has a taste BOTH for the highly technical and the general; he’s a specialist and a public intellectual. He certainly has a taste for technicality early on: Principia Mathematica. I think his inability to see the value in Wittgenstein’s approach has a lot to do with personality clash - for which I mostly blame Wittgenstein’s rudeness to his old teacher. The anti-Russellian rhetoric of “Philosophical Investigations” would be pretty hard to swallow, if you were the target. An interesting example of a debate across the timeline is Russell rebutting Strawson’s (rather Wittgensteinian) criticisms of Russell. A very late piece by Russell (I don’t have it handy.) Russell does a very good job of standing up for the technical solutions he had been pushing since the teens. I consider myself a Wittgensteinian, pretty much (full disclosure.) I do accept that there are qualitative changes - big ones - after the war. But they have to be understood as transformations of what came before, which leave a lot in place. Analytic philosophy talking itself into logical positivism, then positivism talking itself out of itself, leaving no clear ‘method of analysis’ standing. Rather awkward. Two dogmas and all that. Stuff starts to spread out after that. In insisting on continuity I was leaning too far out that way, in anticipation that Emerson might try to define all that stuff out of ‘analytic philosophy’. Sorry for the confusion. Process philosophy. That’s a funny one. I read a lot of Whitehead for about a month, once. It’s very interesting stuff. By John Holbo on 03/02/06 at 01:04 AM | Permanent link to this comment Matt, I’ll just repeat my ‘in part’ point. If you just say ‘perhaps people become analytic philosophers in part out of fear’, even if you give that some weight by narrating real institutional history, it is still a bit of a rhetorical cheat IF you don’t consider any other ‘in parts’, and IF this is part of a larger effort aiming at philosophic critique. I am MORE than willing to consider a broadly ecological argument that McCarthyism plus professionalization bumped off some non-analytics, and discouraged some others, so a small ecosystem came to be dominated by one species, which then managed to breed and exclude competitors in an institutional sense. This is a path-dependence thesis. It could be true. I’m not really sure (and I haven’t been able to read McCumber’s book.) The problem is: I fear it is too tempting to play up the sense that this shows there is something wrong with analytic philosophy. Why should it show that? (You might say that it refutes the view that analytic philosophy could only rise to the top by being the cream. But, honestly, analytic philosophers don’t defend themselves with bad Darwinian arguments. So this isn’t much progress.) By John Holbo on 03/02/06 at 01:26 AM | Permanent link to this comment On the political question. I think there’s a difference between arguing that philosophy departments should become, say, barricade manning departments of marxist agitation and thinking that there’s very little worldliness, right now, in philosophy departments and philosophical work… It’s very popular - and at time appropriate - to say that literary humanities no longer speak to a broad audience, that’s the field’s become caught up in a private jargon that deals with in-house issues. But this critique goes double for AP, no? At least lit folks are trying - the spirit is willing, if the method is weak. (A long time ago, I used on here an example thesis title from a AP guy that I knew from a interdisciplinary fellowship program, and somebody who knows both of us showed up to whack me over the head about it… (Said whacker and I used to be good buds - I wonder if he knows who I am...) Freaked the poop out of me, when this happened...) So I’ll try mangling it a little further: the problem isn’t that I want you on the barricades, John, it’s that I wonder about work entitled “Should you eat a brick?” When the McCarthy type stuff starts adhering, this sort of deliberate uselessness becomes, well, insistently interesting, but for all the wrong reasons. By CR on 03/02/06 at 02:21 AM | Permanent link to this comment (Sorry - one more thing...) Quoting myself: When the McCarthy type stuff starts adhering, this sort of deliberate uselessness becomes, well, insistently interesting, but for all the wrong reasons. Just as the abdication of the Critical Inquiry brahmins in the wake of 9/11 (with the notable exception of Jameson, of course) is interesting, but for all the wrong reasons. “Sorry, the theory game’s over, and it has nothing to do with the New Normal.” By CR on 03/02/06 at 02:24 AM | Permanent link to this comment I for one enjoy the Holbo/Emerson encounters, as I have some sympathy with both. Maybe we’re all talked out now; but let me try. First, I think the McCarthyism thing works better in explaining why “politically engaged Deweyan pragmatism” got zoinxed in the 50’s (for the right, Dewey’s name is mud even to this day - you know, the “progressive education” stuff) than it does the rise of analytic philosophy. John H is right that we can account for that in philosophical terms alone. For all John E’s talk about resisting abstraction, his description of the state of philosophy strikes me as too ... abstract. Let’s look at the lay of the land (I’ll use names, but I don’t mean simply to drop them like bread crumbs leading out of the forest; I mean as well the things these people talked about.) I see a direct line (continuous surface?) starting with Frege/Wusseww/early Wittgenstein through Carnap to Quine. Naturally some of these connections are critical (e.g., famously, Quine of Carnap) as well as genetic; the point is, as John says, that these people were/are concerned with particular philosophical issues, like (for example) the concept of meaning in formalized and natural languages. Continuing on: no one could dispute the link between Quine and Davidson; and once you reach the later Davidson your immediate surroundings (somewhat to Davidson’s chagrin) are Putnam, Rorty, and McDowell. I just read Tom Rockmore’s recent Hegel, Idealism, and Analytic Philosophy (which I found annoying for reasons I won’t go into here), and he coins a term which may be useful: “analytic neopragmatism,” for the last three named (plus Brandom). (As the title of Rockmore’s book suggests, by the time you get to McDowell your immediate surroundings (ahead of you, that is; behind you are Evans, Peacocke, Wright, Wiggins, and Dummett) are (besides those already named) Kant, Hegel, Gadamer, and the later Wittgenstein (plus Sellars, but let’s not go there). And of course the later Wittgenstein is right next to his earlier self, right back where we started. (So our surface looks kind of Klein bottle-y.) So far, as Rockmore’s term indicates, we’re still at least within hailing distance of analytic philosophy. Farther along still, however, we run into real Deweyans (actually, McDowell, unlike Rorty, never claims to be a Deweyan or even a pragmatist), who think “analytic neopragmatism” is too analytic and not Deweyan enough. They tend to endorse the phenomenological criticism (coming e.g. from Taylor and Dreyfus; see also Joseph Margolis for a more confusing version) of [*deep breath*] McDowell’s Kantian/Hegelian concept of “the unboundedness of the conceptual” realm, insisting instead on a notion of “non-conceptual content” which escapes the “rationalist” grasp in a realm of “pure coping” (you know the drill; Taylor’s written the same article about six times now - see e.g. the Cambridge Companion to Merleau-Ponty). In Deweyan terms, this means extolling Dewey’s implacably non-dualist notion of “experience” against what from that perspective looks like yet another version of the Cartesian subject/object dualism (which, like all the other recent versions of same, swears up and down that it is no such thing). Rockmore actually calls McDowell a “metaphysical realist” - I kid you not. (Them’s fightin’ words!) ANYway, my point is that we will never be able (for good Wittgensteinian reasons, as well as Deweyan ones, as John E says but does not show) to decide the issue of “what ails analytic philosophy, even the good kind [by Deweyan lights]” without actually jumping in and sharpening up that (as of now somewhat flabby) criticism of “analytic neopragmatism.” By my lights, the only thing keeping McDowell and his followers from cornering the market in contemporary anti-Cartesian hardware (attn: pragmatists – note the tool metaphor) is his (their) coyness about how they get to be Hegelians and Wittgensteinians at the same time. (Something’s gotta give.) It’s amazing that for a “Hegelian” McDowell himself has said literally almost nothing about Hegel, let alone the relation to Wittgenstein; though I understand there was just a conference about this in the UK. And doing that jumping and sharpening – even if one means ultimately (or proximately) to endorse the “orthodox” Deweyan conception of experience – means reaching at least back (as McDowell himself does - see his key paper (&quot;Scheme-content Dualism and Empiricism&quot;) in the Davidson Library of Living Philosophers volume) as far as Davidson’s criticism of Quine (and Quine’s of Carnap, etc.). So one ends up (in this context, that of criticizing “analytic philosophy” for its lack of Deweyan “engagement&quot;) discussing the topics at the heart of analytic philosophy – precisely in order to (avoid undue abstraction and) engage with them! Sauce for the goose, eh? For the record, my pedigree goes like this: me Akeel Bilgrami Davidson whoever Davidson’s supervisor was etc. By Dave M on 03/02/06 at 02:30 AM | Permanent link to this comment Shall I split each hair in twain? Do I dare to eat a brick/’Grass is green’ iff grass is green, work my analytic schtick. This brick of yours. Turns one all dreamy and poetical. The very thought. Seriously, I think the impulse to say that silly titles are grounds for dismissing philosophy as useless is more dubious than making fun of silly MLA titles. Obviously what is being gotten at, in such a case, is some sort of paradox. Some account of reasons, specifically. Trying to gain insight into questions like ‘what do I have reason to do?’ by working odd paradoxes is possibly quite in order. Philosophizing via paradoxes is about as classic a method as any. By John Holbo on 03/02/06 at 02:34 AM | Permanent link to this comment I think Davidson might have had Quine as his advisor. Davidson was almost as old, but he came to philosophy late, so he could have had someone his own age as an advisor, and I seem to have heard that somewhere. Before he got his Ph.D. he worked for a while writing jokes for TV. But don’t quote me about Quine being his advisor. By John Holbo on 03/02/06 at 02:39 AM | Permanent link to this comment Of course “Should you eat a brick” MAY perfectly well be utter scholastic twiddling, CR. (Quite likely, on average.) I should have granted that upfront. The point is: insightful investigations of paradoxes looks much like idle twiddling, from a distance. Dave M, thanks for that long, interesting comment. Our surface is klein bottle-y is apt. And so we address our critics (with a Wittgensteinian glare): we seek to show the fly the way into the klein bottle. By John Holbo on 03/02/06 at 02:54 AM | Permanent link to this comment Why assume that later analytic philosophers do not, broadly, share the motives and perspectives of early analytic philosophers? This is just a drive-by from someone whose “pedigree” consists of a couple of Umberto Eco books and a liberal UC Santa Cruz education, but it looks to me like what Derrida’s claiming is that it’s not possible, post-WW2, to share the motives and perspectives of those bygone innocent days (&quot;everything’s different now&quot;), without deliberately (and culpably) blinkering yourself. I don’t know if it’s true, but it seems like the sort of thing Derrida might say. By David Moles on 03/02/06 at 08:30 AM | Permanent link to this comment (It occurs to me that the problem with that is the implicit assumption that Russell, Wittgenstein, et al. were incapable of imagining the horrors that awaited mid-20th-century Europe and, had they been capable, couldn’t possibly have thought the things they thought. Which seems a bit smug.) By David Moles on 03/02/06 at 09:45 AM | Permanent link to this comment Ascertaining the worthiness of the “Weltanschaaung” of analytical philosophy-which, at least according to QUine, was not separate from science itself--would seem to require comparison to other Weltanschaaung’s: postmodernism, marxism, Darwinism, catholicism, etc. This may appear to be sort of unfeasible. At the very least, philosophers at some point seem to be driven to to system building, and then measuring the worth of the various systems; thus analytical ohilosophy is situated in the context of learning and knowledge as a whole, and in examined in regards to historical process. The pragmatists attempted this sort of thing--CS Peirce discusses the possibility of a purely mathematical account of historical causality and necessity (determinism quantified, more or less), but realized that human freedom /intentionality made the task nearly impossible: yet determinism or determinisms (historical, biological, genetic, etc.) obviously have some role in system building. Thomas Kuhn perhaps another example of effective system building, and making use of many concepts of analytical philosophy, yet there is an a-historical aspect to Kuhn (as there is to QUine) and perhaps a somewhat naive view of scientific progress: (the shift from NEwtonian to Einsteinian physics may dazzle, yet what about the Manhattan project, if not WWII as a whole...). Russell too was not unaware of the syncretic issue, or the political and ethical consequences of scientism and scientific materialism, including Darwinism. It does seem naive to assume that AP and/or “scientism” can be taken as sufficient without taking into account historical process and the uses (and misuses) of scientific thinking, mathematics, formal languages, etc.; . But the postmodernist’s innate distrust of scientism or technik may be itself as much a shortcoming as the AP agenda. For instance, many writers’ concerns with the shortcomings of either analytical phil. or post seem to implicitly or explicitly rest on views of intentionality; indeed on views of sanity. That is not an issue which either system really is capable of addressing, but it must be granted that science (biochemistry, brain science) is far more likely to produce a useful and reliable account of intentionality than say phenomenology will. And tracing the various neurological and genetic features of intention would of course have ethical applications, and be in some sense good, as psychoactive medications are good, and conducive to sanity. By phudd on 03/02/06 at 09:49 AM | Permanent link to this comment ...that is to say, psychology taken as a whole, and pathopsychology in particular, may be ultimately more important issues than logic, language and analytical philosophy. Contemporary philosophy people, analytical or continental, often seem afflicted with a type of “Panglossism” which prevents them from confronting psychological issues--literary professionals as well rarely include in their writing some actual empirical observations of humans; postmod’s aversion to empiricism and love for the conceptual and the hegelian itself a type of avoidance.... The psychological context, even Freud’s rather tentative speculations in Civilization and its Discontents seem quite more substantial than “language games” or endless rehashings of “On Denoting,” or the current infatuation with set theory. (later Russell had a keen awareness of pathopsychology as well, tho failing to reach any defeinite conclusions). By x on 03/02/06 at 11:06 AM | Permanent link to this comment I’m not familiar with the Derrida piece except as paraphrased here, but what I’ve said amounts to saying that the anti-ideological, apolitical technocracy which rose during the late 40s and 50s was a strongly negative reaction to the grandiose semi-populist ideologies of the left and right. You can throw in Strauss and Adorno too, as anti-populists at least. Derrida’s undertanding of the significance of the 1932-1945 period is different than the AP one, but you really can’t say that the AP founders didn’t respond or didn’t notice. I don’t claim to be an expert on either AP or mainstream economics. I just note absences in contemporary American academic and intellectual life. My objections to AP and mainstream econ are partly substantive, but they’re above all about opportunity cost. If we had 20% less of both and filled the space with Veblenian, Deweyesque people, the world would be a better place. I do not actually propose that we throw the poor analytic philosophers out on the street along with their helpless, weeping children and their wan, swooning wives (or husbands). Occasionally I see a bit of role reversal here, where suddenly **I** am the repressive Stalinist proposing a purge. By John Emerson on 03/02/06 at 11:20 AM | Permanent link to this comment If you do it right, writing about current events can produce great philosophy. Locke’s First Treatise was of-the-moment and it is now of purely historical interest, but his Second Treatise is both of-the-moment AND of enduring interest. In other words, his engagement in current events informed his philosophy. And that’s one of my biggest beefs. In what I do read of analytic philosophy, abstracting the question from its actual context into an invented formal context is usually the first move. Once the question is formalized, then all work is internal to the formalization chosen. From that point, the possibility that the philosophical discourse will be informed by actuality or corrected against reality is zero. Learning from that source essentially stops. And I often seem to see it being said that this sort of procedure is the best and only one, and that impure and corrupt methodologies (those allowing access to any kind of actuality) produce worthless results. Not just in politics and ethics, but lots of places. The is pretty peripheral, but in analytic approaches to Chinese philosophy (I’m thinking especially of Allinson and Cua, and to a degree Chad Hansen) the first step is usually to sum up the Chinese work in analytical terms, and then work on the summarized version. Translating Chinese philosophy into analytical terminology loses about 99% of what’s there. By John Emerson on 03/02/06 at 11:36 AM | Permanent link to this comment Vebwen, yes; Dewey, nyet.

By spike on 03/02/06 at 01:05 PM | Permanent link to this comment John E – I see what you’re saying about Chad Hansen, but given what he is saying his procedure seems appropriate, or at least not so inappropriate. (John H - see if this sounds familiar....) Hansen’s gripe is that interpreters of Taoism can see that famous opening of the Tao te ching (&quot;the Tao that can be spoken of is not the true Tao” is a popular rendering) and take this to mean, well, that there’s this mystical truth beyond language which our feeble words can only gesture at, whereas in fact the Taoists, esp. Zhuangzi, had a sophisticated account of language that is not a crude mysticism (which Hansen derides as “yin-yang theories&quot;) but does indeed bear an interesting and fruitful resemblance to Western anti-dualistic philosophy of language like Davidson’s, as well as an anti-theoretical stance comparable to the (actual) Wittgenstein’s (although Hansen’s own reading of the relevant Westerners is not quite up to speed by my lights; otoh his book was written in the 80’s, so he has a good excuse). It’s not like he’s squeezing the juice out of it – not at all. In fact he’s telling us Westerners where to look for it. (And if what he – and we – is/are saying about language is right, then the fact that his own account uses theoretical language for its own purposes is no reason to discount it as pointlessly “rigorous.&quot;) I don’t know what you mean when you ask for your mind to be changed about analytic philosophy (given your use of the term, which I don’t necessarily object to in the way John H does). After all, if you like something which has an analytic origin, you are free to say that it isn’t really “analytic” at all (e.g. Cavell; and btw you say you know Cavell but you might reread The Claim of Reason – to “change your mind” not about AP but about other important matters, like what philosophy is and can be). But if something is “analytic” by your lights, even a delightfully crisp and efficient takedown of this or that piece of Cartesian dogma will leave you free to say that it isn’t “synthetic” enough. Instead, what you need is a realignment, by whatever means (and in this context why spurn the power of abstraction – which I might point out should *not* be equated, as you seem to do above, with “formalization” – as a means toward understanding?) of your (apparent) *first-order* conception of what it is for a word to mean something and what is happening when we speak and write (especially about speaking and writing). To do this at the same time as (or by means of) a second-order reacquaintance with the “analytic” way of talking may help cure you of the first-order/second-order dualism you share with your opponents. So instead of recommending “analytic” works, I suggest you read the “Deweyan” criticism of “analytic neopragmatism” I talked about above. Rockmore is clear, if misguided; Margolis is more careful but idiosyncratic and impenetrable. Try David Hildebrand, Beyond Realism and Antirealism: John Dewey and the Neopragmatists, which is loyally Deweyan in its flaying of Putnam and Rorty and their apostasy from the Deweyan faith, but doesn’t have much on Davidson (and nothing about McDowell). Once the issues are on the table, you can read the best attack on Rorty from (mostly) the other direction: Brandom, ed., Rorty and his Critics, and compare. Again, the point is not to show you that “analytic is better,” but to help make possible a further comparison between the “pragmatist” criticism you advocate and, well, different versions (say Wittgensteinian ones; but if W is a “pragmatist,” you didn’t hear it from me). By Dave M on 03/02/06 at 01:42 PM | Permanent link to this comment There’s something about the genealogical thread running through the comments; I guess once the question arises, the temptation to juxtapose ‘analytic philosopher’ with ‘begat’ is compelling. E.g.: “There are no necessary and sufficient conditions for being an analytic philosopher. Any attempts at such a definition generate obvious counter-examples. With all due respect to Socrates, this is not because we don’t know what analytic philosophy is. Rather, and ironically, it is because the expression does not lend itself to a reductive analysis. Most present-day analytic philosophers would regard analysis as being just one tool at their disposal. The expression ‘analytic philosophy’ is best viewed in a Wittgensteinian manner as a family resemblance concept. Analytic philosophy itself can be considered as a ‘form of life’ and viewed in genealogical manner. Thus, it means philosophy in the tradition of such founders as Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein. To push the family metaphor farther, one might say that Frege and Russell begat Wittgenstein, who in turn begat both the Positivists and ordinary language philosophy, the former of whom begat Quine, who begat Davidson and many others.”—preface to Contemporary Analytic Philosophy: Core Readings 2nd ed By nnyhav on 03/02/06 at 01:52 PM | Permanent link to this comment Dave M, I liked Hansen’s first book. His second book, though, almost seemed to ignore the texts he was writing about. Abstraction and formalization aren’t identical; I suppose that formalization is a further level of abstraction.

By John Holbo on 03/02/06 at 11:43 PM | Permanent link to this comment I have just deleted another comment from x. I really don’t wish to fight with you, sir. Some of your comments are quite reasonable, and that is why I haven’t tried to ban you to date; but the abusive ones - well, we are used to them and we don’t mind so much. But I am concerned that unless we can maintain a more civil tone in comments, we won’t be able to draw more people into the conversation. (Of course you are not the only one who is ever uncivil, but sometimes you are REALLY uncivil.) If you can’t understand why I would be sincerely annoyed at some of the personal insults you direct at others, I guess you’ll just have to take my word for it that I am. If you want to read my dissertation, by all means! (Actually, that reminds me. I need to put it back online.) By John Holbo on 03/03/06 at 12:12 AM | Permanent link to this comment Davidson wrote his dissertation on Plato’s Philebus, and Quine couldn’t see the point (DD was Quine’s TA, not his advisee). I think Davidson’s offical doctor-father was actually C.I.Lewis. By Dominic Murphy on 03/03/06 at 01:13 AM | Permanent link to this comment Thanks Dominic. That rings a bell. Of course Quine wouldn’t have been a good advisor for a Plato Ph.D. By John Holbo on 03/03/06 at 02:02 AM | Permanent link to this comment Since the dissertation was mentioned: Whatever happened to the Schopenauer stuff that it was going to be bundled with? I would happily read more in the Schopenhauer-and-Wittgenstein vein. By Daniel on 03/03/06 at 03:09 AM | Permanent link to this comment Daniel, do you mean you want to read the Schopenhauer bits of the dissertation, or you have read the dissertation and are wondering where the rest of the Schopenhauer discussion is - because I kinda end up not doing enough? If the latter, sorry I haven’t done more since. Except for the occasional book review. If the former, I’ll try to take the time to put the dissertation back online over the weekend. By John Holbo on 03/03/06 at 05:33 AM | Permanent link to this comment Taking the Tractatus as a “Grundrisse” of what is known as analytical philosophy may not be entirely mistaken. Yet the core concepts of that Tractarian foundation--a propositional account of language, picture theory of meaning, nominalism, the denial of a causal nexus, and the emphasis on tautology and analyticity (yet those who have read the Tract. closely might have noted that Witt. denies a priori knowledge) ---are nearly as reductionist as Quine’s system (and QUinean nominalism seems quite related to Tractatarian ideas). Apart from the few slightly psychological suggestions, the Tract. is not so far from code: it leaves little or no room for metaphysics, literature or indeed any language other than propositions, operations, and functions. By z on 03/03/06 at 11:36 AM | Permanent link to this comment I read the dissertation, and recall it saying something about the dissertation serving as half of a book, with the other half focusing on Schopenauer more specifically. I was curious what became of that. Maybe I misremember the relevant bits, but at the least I am sure I read something about it being made into a book. As an aside, I originally found your dissertation through random googling (IIRC, I was looking up some detail about Kant’s Prolegomena). Google brought up chapter one only, but I liked it enough that I fiddled with the URL until I had found the rest of the chapters. Seperately, I had been reading your blog for a few months after so-and-so linked to you, with no idea that you were the author of the dissertation I’d found—I assumed it was just some random grad student’s work. Finding out that I had already been reading the guy who wrote it was a bit of a shock. If you’re going to put the dissertation back online (which sounds like a good idea to me, since I know that some people do find such things through random googling), then you might want to put your name on it a bit more clearly. Looking at the PDFs, I’m not seeing your name in there anywhere. Probably a detail worth including. By Daniel on 03/03/06 at 01:15 PM | Permanent link to this comment Daniel: No need to add his name. We can all recognize John Holbo’s writing style after a few sentences. John E: This is slightly off-topic, but a) I replied to one of your posts on The Weblog, and b) I’m dutifully reading the books you mentioned that critique neo-classical economics. By Walt Pohl on 03/03/06 at 01:53 PM | Permanent link to this comment Schoepenhauer was not such a bad systematizer, and he charts out his arguments (and his errors) rather carefully; more than Kant could say. Yet those men who take Wittgenstein to be upholding some form of philosophical idealism are not paying sufficient attention to his ideas on naming and objects, for one: the objects are external; does he not also claim the world is independent of the will, contra Schoepenhauer? (in fact he does, 6.373). And W’s statement near the end (6.53) that one can speak of nothing but the “propositions of natural science” seems to indicate again a realism of a physicalist sort, tho W’s ideas in regards to the, well, ontological status of the “great mirror” of logic are a bit perplexing. But I look forward to reading it, sir. By x on 03/03/06 at 02:25 PM | Permanent link to this comment Walt, the intro to Collander / Holt / Rosser, IIRC, used the term “neo-classical” economics to mean orthodox-mainstream. Other heterodox-mainstream schools listed are Austrian, neo-institutionalist, neo-Keynsian, Marxist and (tokenism here) feminist. And outside that circle there were the real outsiders, I think. I got the general idea but didn’t remember the laballing quite exactly. The whole tyopology seemed like a special-pleading balancing act, as if their three-way split was trying to isolate and stigmatize the too-orthodox while still not legitimizing the really bad guys outside the profession. Mirowski’s “Machine Dreams” is easy to read but hard to understand if you don’t already know the stuff pretty well, which I don’t. I have Keen’s “Debunking Economics” on order. By John Emerson on 03/03/06 at 02:40 PM | Permanent link to this comment Keen has a very complete web presence. I needn’t even have bought his book. On the other hand, he sometimes uses the “comic” typeface, which is unforgivable except for very, very good friends. Debunking Economics http://www.debunking-economics.com/ By John Emerson on 03/03/06 at 02:47 PM | Permanent link to this comment Another of Johnny E’s Dewey-lite assumptions concerns that liberal chestnut, Duty. Philosophers and academics have a Duty to reform politics, to be decent altruists and socialists, and work towards that dreamt-of proudhonian Zion. (and postmods often seem to slip into this “thou ought” mode as well). A few perusals of the proto-analytic Hume’s writings on the fact/value distinction might have corrected E’s Sally Struthers’ tendencies (as would, say, Darwin and Malthus) . Russell himself admitted that he could not actually justify his politics more than saying that socialism would bring him more pleasure (more greater numbers of people more pleasure) than capitalism did. Or do you feel there are some transcendent, quasi-Kantian political obligations that millions of people are failing to perceive, Mr. E.?

There’s a symposium on him that is useful in Philosophy of the Social Sciences 22(1992). By roger on 03/03/06 at 05:21 PM | Permanent link to this comment Reading this thread well after the fact, it seems, is very strange to one like me, who has one foot firmly planted in theoretical syntax/&quot;Chomskyan&quot; linguistics and the other foot planted in computer science---but not that much of background in philosophy in se except a dilettante’s interest fueled by reading blogs and discussion boards. My interest in language is explaining the character of the human capacity for language, and what people are calling “analytic philosophy” here is regularly alluded to in the linguistics literature, because it tends to impinge highly on the matter of the origin of the capacity for language. What’s typically called “continental” philosophy is never alluded to, because it doesn’t seem to say anything about such matters as far as I can tell. I mean, what linguists call Fodor’s “atomism” is of paramount interest in determining how the mind generates words in the context of sentences. I wonder if this is why some of the linguists who lost the “generative semantics” warz went on to try to connect language and politics (Lakoff...). The Old Man himself (and by that I mean Chomsky), while being extremely politically engaged, is very disparaging of any such connection. And because we can use language to express both “good” and “bad” ideas, it’s very hard to argue with him. By Mandos on 03/03/06 at 07:50 PM | Permanent link to this comment When analytic philosophy succeeds, it turns into science and is absorbed by the science it contributes to. I’ve been assured by people I respecty that analytic philosopher does contribute to computer science, AI, and linguistics, and that would certaily be a success and a validation for AP, but the philosophy I’m interested is about history, politcs, and other macro areas of human life. “Continental philosophy” is the Washington Wizards to analytic philosophy’s Globetrotters, or the Workers and Peasnt’s Party to the AP’s Communist Party. I’m not a continental (neither breakfast nor Lincoln). By John Emerson on 03/03/06 at 08:08 PM | Permanent link to this comment Chomsky (as in Language and the Problems of Knowledge) seems nearly platonic in some of his thinking; he mentions language faculty as part of humans’ “biological endowment,” but the neurological mechanisms/functions of deep structure and syntactical transformations are not specified. Of course that sort of confirmation is not something that many theoretical philosophers or linguists are going to be very successful at. The innateness concept of UG might be assailed as well, were some suitably motivated empiricists around (Prof. Dennett and his associates seem to be taking that on). There is (and has been for years) data showing that C’s ideas regarding the creative use of language are not as well founded as initially thought. In addition to environmental conditioning (which C. did not really refute), genetic determinism presents another complex, troubling issue commonly skirted by the UG language acquisition cadre. But since Chomsky is assumed to be PC, many of his ideas seem to have carte blanche regardless if they are about equal in stature (and shall we say, residential listing) to the Platonic noesis… By z on 03/03/06 at 10:21 PM | Permanent link to this comment I know a surprisingly large number of the leading present purveyors of Chomskyan syntax, and I know for certain that they firmly disagree with every point you make, but I myself only have one foot there, not both, so I won’t belabour the point by arguing with you this too long with you, except so say… I will say that there is more progress being made on the neurological matter, even from the Chomskyan point of view, than you seem to be willing to admit, and I’ve been a very peripheral bystander in some of it. Psycholinguistics marches on. And one of my interests as a computer scientist in that matter is describing what transformations would actually need. And it’s very hard to refute that any system that produces human language requires more than the formal power of a context-free grammar. Any “empiricist” explanation must be able to explain the context-sensitivity (in a formal sense, not in the colloquial sense), otherwise it is an incoherent, and certainly any neurological one must do so as well. Whether Chomsky “refuted” or didn’t refute operant conditioning is really besides the point. As I understand it, of course you can operant-condition anyone. It just doesn’t mean anything. It means you’ve invented the science of the prison, but that’s it. And your “PC” attack is, well, to put it mildly, unfounded and makes your motives suspect.

Well...once again we get back to what I think is part of John’s point here. It appears to be only a matter that you like something different from what analytic philosophers like. Et bien? I guess if your complaint reduces to one about the demographics of philosophy departments, then… I guess I could be annoying and raise the Smarmy Scientist Geek’s Objection To Philosophizing About Fluffy Things. It’s always been a suspicion among us techie-er types that most of the humanities is just an excuse to talk about whatever you want, freed of a connection to verification. I mean, talking about the “big picture” stuff suggests a convergence with economics and other social science (itself fraught with problems I won’t raise here). By Mandos on 03/04/06 at 12:42 AM | Permanent link to this comment I’ve never concealed the fact that I was in the losing faction in a turf battle. There was pork to be controlled, and the analytics won. To me that finger points both ways. Money and jobs were at stake, and whatever else is true, the analytics got them. I’m historically correct, though I’ve seen it denied recently, that the analytics enormously narrowed the range of philosophy compared to what it had been before 1950 or so. I have a number of other specific criticisms that I’ll make later. It appears to be only a matter that you like something different from what analytic philosophers like. Makes it seem likes a matter of ice cream preferences. But what I object to is not the very existence of analytic philosophy, but its monopoly. You are annoying, and your objection is a well-known cliche which happens to be a basic principle of analytic philosophy. IE, begging the question. When a scientist says he can discuss the topics I raise better than I can, it’s up to him to put up or shut up. If he says that no intelligent discussion is possible about those topics, he’s just stupid. The verification criteria is very dodgy and obsolete, but overall you’re just begging the question, as I said, by taking the criteria of analytic philosophy for given. By John Emerson on 03/04/06 at 09:00 AM | Permanent link to this comment “It’s always been a suspicion among us techie-er types that most of the humanities is just an excuse to talk about whatever you want, freed of a connection to verification. Agreed. Then computational linguists should be consistent and apply a verification criteria to Chomsky’s ideas of an intermediate” mental grammar.” (and pay no attention to any zany Deweyans or postmods who say the verification criteria is obsolete in regards to induction). Claims about syntax are about brain functions, perception, sensation as much about language; language is part of the biological hardware, of neurology, and biochemistry--which is to say, it’s all hardware eventually, unless some bizarre “vector” account of mind were plausible. Chomsky has for years been obsessed with rather Rousseauian concepts of freedom--as evidenced in his initial attacks on Skinner (which, even if to some degree correct in regards to language acquisition, do not refute behaviorism as a whole)--yet biologists and evolutionary psychologists have been telling a rather different story. Those Rousseauian ideas of freedom that C. champions are not in themselves politically beneficial either. Not that stimulus-response theory or Skinner’s operant conditioning is the alternative, but there are many reasons to question romantic ideas of freedom (and really intentionality) whether in regards to language acquisition or politics. Cognitivism and linguistics at some point has to deal with biological hardware and thus evolution and genetics: Chomsky seems to avoid that issue entirely. But then many naifs of the left--ignoring even Marx’s consistent materialism and anti-idealism--seem to think that biology is itself tainted. In his Language and the Problems of Knowledge, Chomsky makes no apologies for his classical rationalism, and pretty much takes platonic and cartesian attitudes throughout: it’s the return of Casper (the friendly ghost), but he has some powerful ivy league connections. By 818 on 03/04/06 at 11:03 AM | Permanent link to this comment Cognitivism and linguistics at some point has to deal with biological hardware and thus evolution and genetics: Chomsky seems to avoid that issue entirely. No, he doesn’t---at least him as the personification of his school of thought. Take a look at Juan Uriagereka’s book Rhyme and Reason for specific arguments that take most of your claims head-on, since all your arguments depend fundamentally on this belief that biology is “avoided”. There’s even a branch of psycholinguistic research that investigates some of these claims using what you might call “biological” brain-observation methods. Of course, it’s very difficult. The Chomskyans ARE saying that linguistics as a study exists on an equal footing with biology, etc. That’s quite different from saying that they are avoiding it. By Mandos on 03/04/06 at 11:46 AM | Permanent link to this comment Emerson: note that I said “could”. I’ll have a fuller response later, but I’m busy listening to people bloviate in a classical rationalist cartesian linguistic analysis mode.

By John Emerson on 03/04/06 at 01:37 PM | Permanent link to this comment feel no obligation to respond to someone who, one, thinks John Dewey was a profound thinker, and two, claims verification has been rejected, and three, mistakes mahayana buddhism for philosophy… Señor Madnos: there’s another issue however: Chomsky’s UG converts all languages into european terms: nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. The mayan language “nahautl” did not have nouns and verbs, and the definitions and translations of the pictographs are hardly well-estlabished. It was converted into european terms. The homological structure of language thesis asserted by UG people has not been conclusivly determined. A hopi “agglutanive” word-sentence might include what are called nouns, verbs, and modifiers in one long morpheme. Yes, the western field linguist tries to break it down into nominal and verbal phrases, but that of course is a “gloss.” Moreover there are unresolved semantic issues with UG (which QUine I believe raised at one point): the field linguist finds a hidden tribe and attempts to translate their language: how does he do that? Maybe by correlating some phonemes with various objects and events, but there is no “necessary” connection indicated. What if various tribesmen give different sounds for say the campfire? In some sense, the Sapir-Whorf issue was never fully dealt with, tho’ Panglosses of the Chomskyan school seem to think it was. By 818 on 03/04/06 at 01:57 PM | Permanent link to this comment Sapir-Whorf is a quaint fossil, somewhat to my regret. There are Mayan languages still spoken; difficulties in deciphering the heiroglyphs are irrelevant. Dunno about Mayan, but Chinese doesn’t have distinguishable nouns and verbs either, but sentence structure tells you how a given word functions in a sentence (as part of a NP or a VP, for example). Quine was too fond of relativism. By John Emerson on 03/04/06 at 02:22 PM | Permanent link to this comment No es posible determinar sustantivos o verbos de idiomas desconocidas simplemente por la forma. La correlación o la definición por la observación es necesaria. un extracto: “¿Qué es el náhuatl? Llanamente, es un idioma indígena de México. Hoy, es la lengua indígena mexicana con mayor número de hablantes (alrededor de millón y medio). Además, es y ha sido un idioma valioso por su importancia histórica (de una civilización desarrollada lejos del viejo mundo), lingüística (es aglutinante no indoeuropeo), literaria y hasta nacionalista. Ciertamente, toda lengua es un tesoro, un milagro abstracto, real y práctico. Aprender una nueva lengua, te ata inevitablemente al ser mismo de sus hablantes, por esto el acercarse al náhuatl es una forma de meterse en las raíces más antiguas y sutiles de la cosmovisión mexicana. (Por eso he llegado a pensar que los amantes de la lingüística son los historiadores antropólogos etnólogos técnicos románticos más útiles que existen). La influencia del náhuatl no ha sido pequeña. Hay reminiscencias del náhuatl regadas por aquí y por allá, en las palabras, en las formas de hablar y hasta en las de sentir y ver el mundo. Corresponde a cada uno darles el valor que se desee después de haberse topado con alguna de ellas. (Y es aquí donde uno busca relacionar el sentido de la vida con la lingüística) ¿usted entiende eso? bastante Holy cow!!

But it has. This story appears on the front page of today's New York Times: President Bush authorized Vice President Dick Cheney in July 2003 to permit Mr. Cheney's chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby Jr., to leak key portions of a classified prewar intelligence estimate on Iraq, according to Mr. Libby's grand jury testimony. The testimony, cited in a court filing by the government late Wednesday, provides the first indication that Mr. Bush, who has long assailed leaks of classified information as a national security threat, played a direct role in the disclosure of the intelligence report on Iraq at a moment that the White House was trying to defend itself against charges that it had inflated the case against Saddam Hussein. Well, here is how the filing (PDF) by special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald describes what happened (page 23): Defendant [Libby] testified that the Vice President later advised him that the President had authorized defendant to disclose the relevant portions of the NIE [National Intelligence Estimate]. Defendant testified that he also spoke to David Addington, then Counsel to the Vice President, whom defendant considered to be an expert in national security law, and Mr. Addington opined that Presidential authorization to publicly disclose a document amounted to a declassification of the document. In other words, this was an authorized disclosure of information, the opposite of a leak! Yet the Times, the Washington Post and even the New York Sun (albeit only in a headline) call it a &quot;leak.&quot; jill | 04.07.06 - 3:59 pm | # No offense to Incog, wherever he may be, but how in the hell do you not know that your cat is a she?

Falstaff | 04.07.06 - 4:29 pm | # Tornado A tornado is a violently spinning column of air in contact with both a cumiliform cloud base and the surface of the earth. A tornado is typically shaped like a funnel with the narrow end on the ground. Tornadoes are known for being extremely destructive and are usually visible due to water vapor from low pressure condensation and debris from the ground. Tornadoes form in storms all over the world, and though they have been recorded in all fifty U.S. states, they form most famously in a broad area of the American Great Plains, Midwest, as well as South known colloquially as Tornado Alley. In pure number of incidences, the United States reports more tornadoes than any other country, however, the Netherlands is the most tornado-prone country relative to land area.

Lewis Libby will try to show that the leaking of a CIA agent's name grew out of a highly organized administration effort that commanded high-level attention, a court filing this week shows. Pretrial filings by Mr. Libby's defense team indicate they intend to argue that any misstatements made in Mr. Libby's testimony to investigators and a grand jury were innocent mistakes because of his focus on more pressing national-security issues. They are seeking a wide array of classified and sensitive information they say is necessary for trial, including secret daily intelligence briefings given to the president. This week's filing by Patrick Fitzgerald, the special prosecutor, was intended to convince the judge to deny the defense's latest request for information. In doing so, the prosecutor also attacked Mr. Libby's bad-memory defense by introducing new information about the attention -- including by President Bush -- placed on responding to Joseph Wilson, a former ambassador and critic of the Iraq war. etc.etc.etc. ------------ Holy fucking shit. - QuentinCompson | Homepage | 04.08.06 - 2:11 am | # it will take at least a decade to root out all the dumbass, incompetant appointees put in place to purposely sabotage the government, at all levels. .

Evacuee Evacuee, at this point, I fear you ar correct. There are too many Democrats who are DINO/Republican lite now. Bill Clinton, for example, is the best Republican President since Eisenhower. The Founders were, above all else, concered with power balances. Not just in the government itself, either. They had a broader vision, which is why they were very suspicious of things like the British East India Company. Jefferson considered banks to be as dangerous as standing armies.

One thing is very clear, Team Bush/Cheney has worked damn hard to directly server their elite base in the manner and detail that elite base most wanted, without reguard to the sanity or coherence of those requests.

While Clinton was a vast improvement over the 12 years of Reagan/Bush I, I wasn't happy with much of his agenda, either. I was not happy that he immediately backed down on gays in the military, specifically because the brass' stance on it reflected unprofessionalism on a broad scale in the military. That the troops could not keep it in their pants, regardless of sexual orientation, and the brass was unwilling to do what it takes to change that. But then, the brass fought racial integration, too, as being something in the &quot;too hard&quot; box. Then the health care mess, which missed the entire point by allowing a privatized bureaucracy dedicated to squeezing profit to be the gatekeeper. This is doomed to failure from the getgo. Single payer is the only real solution to a situation where the market fails and cannot succeed. One does not cut out cupons and travel around to emergency rooms looking for the best deal in care. It does not work that way. Don't get me started on him missing the point on welfare, either. Or by sucking up to the parasite corporations. But one thing Clinton did manage to do is make enemies I could never ally with against him. Fundies. Authoritarians. Greedy assholes. People out to use power not benefit the commonwealth, but to benefit a very small subset of it. Clinton was far from perfect, but it wasn't because of the blow job.

Mrs. Ibrahim al-jaafari | 04.08.06 - 3:18 am | # Ladies and gentleman, there were beershits brewing below that were on the scale of Greek tragedy. I sat and I squirmed, and my stomach made ominous noises. I was sure I could squeak out some farts to relieve some pressure and heat, and maybe give my poor colon a little bit more expansion room so as not to rupture it. The first one was so small, after I'd lifted my right cheek to sneak it out it felt like nothing had happened. But then the smell hit. Words alone simply cannot describe this small sampling of what was forthcoming. This was the worst fart I'd ever had -- and it was only the pace car. It was like someone had forced me next to a cow's ass while it expelled a patty. But it eased the agony... and I was the only one who had smelled it, so far. I continued to hang out and sneak farts and try to take notes without thinking about the Bud bomb trying with increasing violence to rattle loose. A few of my fellow students began to notice how ripe the room smelled. I mentioned that it must be either the professor or maybe some esoteric odor from a senior's academic final project. Nobody bought it; and to my horror, the stench was getting worse. I usually claim my babies -- solid AND gas -- but not that day. Finally, halfway through the two-hour lab, it seemed that things had quieted down and that I was going to finish the class without another shart. But I was sorely mistaken. It was right then that I had the longest, foulest fart I have ever experienced. It was silent but oh so deadly. It rushed out of my ass for at least six seconds; and then the stench hit.

Long Sunday has seen recent speculations on the relationship between intellectuals (cold, narrow, and resenting!) and political power. It is, of course, a hot topic, with that Straussian conspiracy in full swing in significant sections of the American administration and the rise to power of the Conservation Party (formerly the Conservative-Reform Alliance Party -- no shit: their accronym was CRAP) in Canada with its ties to the Fraser Institute and, thus, the so-called &quot;Calgary School&quot; of Strausso-libertarian policy wonks. Not to be outdone, the social democratic party, the NDP, has Jack Layton, a former professor, as its leader. Really not wanting to be outdone after suffering increasingly embarassing defeats, the Liberal Party, also informally known as the Natural Ruling Party, is in search of a new leader. That is, in their minds, the next Prime Minister of Canada. Among the contestants for this most honoured of offices are Michael Ignatieff and Stephane Dion, both former professors. According to the Toronto Star, the Liberal Party needs candidates with more than just &quot;big brains&quot;, they also -- aiming at the rookie MP Ignatieff -- need candidates who are experienced at &quot;simultaneously playing for themselves and the team&quot;. As far as I can tell, Ignatieff, as a successful (note: not necessarily good!) academic, is no doubt well versed in the art of promoting the self through promoting the department's interest. Afterall, this narrow conception of politics is precisely what we practice in the academy.

Ackerman is a constitutional scholar whose thought experiment engages what might happen after the next attack. It's good to see such hypotheticals finally getting some attention. Now if only NPR would introduce their paltry whitebeard audience to David Ray Griffin and the impressive fiction of the 9/11 Commission Report. But speaking of myths and such, can anyone explain to me why it's warranted for Giuliani to testify in the Moussaoui trial? I mean, as opposed to any other accidental witness to this event, of which there seem to have been a few. More worthy of note, John Berger has penned a couple of fine things lately.

He was listened to, or claimed the right to be listened to, as the representative of the universal. To be an intellectual was to some extent to be the conscience of all.' There is little that can be said in response to this warning. When a number of us took part in the May 1968 movement, they hoped to be preserved from any ambition in the singular, and in a way they succeeded, through not being singled out for attention, but treated in the same way as everyone else, the strength of the anti-authoritarian movement making it almost easy to forget all particularity, and impossible to distinguish between young and old, the unknown and the too well-known, as if, despite the differences and the incessant disputes, each person recognized himself in the anonymous words inscribed on the walls and which, in the end, even when on occasion they were the result of a collective effort, never declared themselves the words of an author, being of all and for all, in their contradictory formulation. But of course that was an exception...

The discovery of society introduces a radical break into history. It is co-extensive with the destruction of what Michel Foucault calls the 'classic episteme' and the birth of the 'modern episteme'; &quot;it is a radical event that is distributed across the entire visible surface of knowledge.&quot; Foucault's periodization of the break suggests certain problems -- problems that are common to his entire school limiting 'the social' primarily to statistical regularities and, in the case of Donzelot, 'the policing of families' through 'social work'. On the one hand, 'society' had been mobilized as a term designating what we might want to call a club or association; that is, a group formed between the 'public' and the 'private' for specific purposes. In this way, The Royal Society, founded in 1660 stands out as a marker of a new use of the word. Yet, for these natural scientists, 'society' had as of yet to be discovered. What remains certain, however, is that by 1748, when Charles Louis de Secondat (the Baron de Montesquieu) published The Spirit of the Laws that 'society' had been discovered in the epynomous concept. And, certainly, by 1789 it was taken for granted that society was an object of action; that is, it could both act -- society could make demands -- and, on the other hand, it could be acted upon -- society could have demands made against it.

(One shudders at the thought of their bastard offspring -- and rightly so, do we not find that figure in Tony Blair's ideologue, Anthony Giddens?) Making parallel but inverse claims, both Laclau and Thatcher assert the death of the social in their aphoristic philosophy. On the one hand, Laclau proudly informs us that &quot;society is impossible&quot; and, on the other hand, Thatcher smugly proclaims &quot;there is no such thing as society; there are individual men and women, and there are families&quot;. While their politics, presumably, do not coincide, the basis of their politics do. According to Laclau, &quot;'Society' is not a valid object of discourse&quot;. This is to say that the referrent of 'society' cannot be 'fixed' and any attempt to 'fix' the meaning of 'society' is an instance of 'hegemony' -- the imposition of a false universal. For Laclau to claim that society is impossible is to claim that demands cannot be made in the name of society or against society. Thatcher fully agrees with this analysis. Asserting that there are, on one hand, individuals and, on the other hand, families, Thatcher is arguing for a stringent division between the public and the private. Thus, publically, people interact as individuals on the market and, privately, people interact intimately in morality. Morality, 'Victorian values', and 'family values' are equivalent: moral demands can only be made against intimates. All other demands -- those that occur in public -- take on a market form and are thus most fully resolved through tort law. Either way, society as a moral domain, one able to make demands on individuals and groups and one subject to demands by individuals and groups does not exist; indeed, it cannot. Consequently, making demands in the name of the social; that is, asserting the priority of the social over other forms of organization, especially the economy, is, from this perspective, both the most criminal and the most naive thing one could say. To assert the social is to destroy neo-liberalism.

But let us note that there is no transcendental consequence more powerful than the appearance of something that did not exist. That is how the day March 18, 1871 places in the center of a political turmoil a collection of unknown workers, unrecognized even by the specialists of the revolution, by those old &quot;forty-eighters&quot; that will unfortunately hinder the Commune with their ineffective disputes about words. Let us return to the first proclamation of March 19 by the Central Committee, the organism directly responsible for the insurrection of the eighteenth. &quot;May Paris and France together lay down the foundation for a republic acclaimed in all ways, the only government that will forever close the era of invasions and civil wars.&quot; Who signs this political declaration without precedent? Twenty people, three-quarters of whom belong to the proletarians defined and constituted solely by circumstance. The newspaper of the government has every reason to ask: &quot;Who are the members of this Committee? Are they communists, bonapartists or Prussians?&quot; Here the unshakeable motive of the &quot;foreign agents&quot; can already be seen. In reality the result of the event is that for the first time the inexistent workers are carried into a temporarily maximal, political existence.

There were also a number of related posts elsewhere: Destructive Creation, Northanger, Going Somewhere, Philosophy.com, pas au-delà, Attitude Adjustor.

My immense gratitude to all those who contributed their writings, readings and questions - those who simply took the time to read along with, and specifically those, such as Matt, who spent much time coding and uploading. Already, Jon has the ball rolling for another reading, and I'm hoping that blogweaving continues, mutates and grows. Not only because it creates a shared conversation that cuts across various blogs without converging along the one line, but also because - in ways that have yet to be fully explored - it marks an autonomy of writing, reading and research from the university that, particularly in times such as these, becomes an imperative. Needless to say, what we read and write is related to how we read and write, no less than it is to the diificult questions of who, how and why this 'we' might appear, in that process. Many thanks for the adventure.

Growth was high, unemployment was low, and yet inflation remained perfectly under control. Greenspan had a simple explanation for that. Worker insecurity: But even if the perceived quicker pace of application of our newer technologies turns out to be mere wheel-spinning rather than true productivity advance, it has brought with it a heightened sense of job insecurity and, as a consequence, subdued wage gains. As I pointed out here last February, polls indicated that despite the significant fall in the unemployment rate, the proportion of workers in larger establishments fearful of being laid off rose from 25 percent in 1991 to 46 percent by 1996. It should not have been surprising then that strike activity in the 1990s has been lower than it has been in decades and that new labor union contracts have been longer and have given greater emphasis to job security. Nor should it have been unexpected that the number of workers voluntarily leaving their jobs to seek other employment has not risen in this period of tight labor markets. To be sure, since last year, surveys have indicated that the proportion of workers fearful of layoff has stabilized and the number of voluntary job leavers has edged up. And, indeed, perhaps as a consequence, wage gains have accelerated some. As long as people are scared to lose their jobs they don't ask for more money. And that is of course the reason to bring this up today. The CPE. The conventional wisdom is that the mob just doesn't understand that if it's easy to fire people, employers will sooner hire them. Maybe so, though it should perhaps also be pointed out that if it's easy to fire people, it's easy to fire people, and that too has an effect on unemployment figures. But ultimately unemployment is not what laws like the CPE are about. The worker insecurity they create is not some accidental side-effect; it has a very clear function. 119468658_0dee1a9ae0 Posted on March 28, 2006 by David | Category: Economics | Link to “Liberté, Flexibilité, Précarité” | Comments (17) | TrackBack (0) Long Sunday ‘You are reserved for a great Monday!’ Fine, but Sunday will never end.—Kafka « January 2006 | Main | March 2006 » The Echo of the Subject HarpoI've been looking around for an online version of Lacoue-Labarthe's essay, &quot;The Echo of the Subject,&quot; in Typography: Mimesis, Philosophy, Politics.

It no longer controls events, as it did for centuries, but is at the mercy of a succession of unforeseeable blow-backs. Those who deplore the ideological bankruptcy of the West should recall that ‘God smiles at those he sees denouncing evils of which they are the cause’. If the explosion of the banlieues is thus directly linked to the world situation, it is also—a fact which is strangely never discussed—connected to another recent episode, solicitously occluded and misrepresented in just the same way: the No in the eu Constitutional referendum. Those who voted No without really knowing why—perhaps simply because they did not wish to play the game into which they had so often been trapped; because they too refused to be integrated into the wondrous Yes of a ‘ready for occupancy’ Europe—their No was the voice of those jettisoned by the system of representation: exiles too, like the immigrants themselves, from the process of socialization. There was the same recklessness, the same irresponsibility in the act of scuppering the eu as in the young immigrants’ burning of their own neighbourhoods, their own schools; like the blacks in Watts and Detroit in the 1960s.

While not quite as famous as the most controversial President in the United States, who has instituted a torture archipelago, a number of illegal wars, and even more illegal polices at home, Lawrence H. Summers is nonetheless widely -- and justifiably -- loathed for saying a number of really dumb things. (More dumb things.) By resigning now, Summers dodges a second no-confidence vote by the members of the arts and sciences faculty, scheduled for February 28. In his letter of resignation, Summers writes: As fulfilling as they have been in many ways, these last years have not been without their strains and moments of rancor. After a period of sabbatical and reflection, I look forward to taking up the tasks of teaching and research at the University and to returning to my professional preoccupation with questions of national and international economic policy. In the meantime, I hope and trust that we will together move through the remainder of this academic year in a spirit of good will and constructive engagement with the work of the University. I will treasure the continuing friendship and support of so many exceptional colleagues and students at Harvard. I will always be grateful for the opportunity to have served as Harvard's President.

Proust shared this belief, and from it he developed the lifelong exercises in which he strove to bring to light past things saturated with all the reminiscenses that had worked their way into his pores during his sojourn in the unconscious. Proust was an incomparable reader of Fleurs du mal, for he sensed that it contained kindred elements. Familiarity with Baudelaire must include Proust's experience with him. Proust writes: &quot;Time is peculiarly chopped up in Baudelaire; only a very few days open up, they are significant ones. Thus it is understandable why turns of phrases like 'one evening' occur frequently in his works.&quot; These significant days are days of recollection, not marked by any experience. They are not connected with the other days, but stand out from time. As for their substance, Baudelaire has defined it in the notion of the correspondances, a concept that in Baudelaire stands side by side and unconnected with the notion of &quot;modern beauty.&quot; Disregarding the scholarly literature on the correspondances (the common property of the mystics; Baudelaire encountered them in Fourier's writings), Proust no longer fusses about the artistic variations on the situation which are supplied by synaesthesia. The important thing is that the correspondances record a concept of experience which includes ritual elements. Only by appropriating these elements was Baudelaire able to fathom the full meaning of the breakdown which he, a modern man, was witnessing. Only in this way was he able to recognize in it the challenge meant for him alone, a challenge which he incorporated in the Fleurs du mal. [...] The correspondances are the data of remembrance–not historical data, but data of prehistory. What makes festive days great and significant is the encounter with an earlier life. Baudelaire recorded this in a sonnet entitled &quot;La Vie antérieure.&quot; The images of caves and vegetation, of clouds and waves which are evoked at the beginning of this second sonnet rise from the warm vapor of tears, tears of homesickness. &quot;The wanderer looks into the tear-veiled distance, and hysterical tears well up in his eyes,&quot; writes Baudelaire in his review of the poems of Marceline Desbordes-Valmore. There are no simultaneous correspondences, such as were cultivated by the symbolists later. The murmur of the past may be heard in the correspondences, and the canonical experience of them has its place in a previous life: Les houles, en roulant les images des cieux, Mêlaient d'une façon solennelle et mystique Aux couleurs du couchant refléte par mes yeux. C'est là que j'ai vécu... The breakers, rolling the images of the sky, Mixed, in a mystical and solemn way, The powerful chords of their rich music With the colors of the sunset reflected in my eyes. There did I live... [...] &quot;Recueillement&quot; traces the allegories of the old years against the deep sky: ...Vois se pencher les défuntes Années Sur les balcons du ciel, en robes surannées ...See the dead departed Years in antiquated Dress leaning over heaven's balconies. In these verses Baudelaire resigns himself to paying homage to times out of mind that escaped him in the guise of the outdated.

As with Habermas, one might see Zizek's discussion of justice and solidarity as two sides of the same coin. But, rather than reconciled within a communicative universality, Zizek's two sides are those of the law and the revolutionary collective, the impersonal, abstract law that must suspend imagination and focus on principle, on the one side, and the revolutionary violence and hatred in the service of the work of love, that is, in the service of revolutionary justice, on the other. Each side involves an abstraction, a subjective destitution, a resolve to escape the 'vicious cycle of understanding.' How, then, do we understand solidarity? Solidarity is the one virtue specific to the political. We don't use solidarity to describe relations between friends, family members, congregants in a church, or soldiers in an army. It is not a relation of consumer to consumed, capital to labor, professor to student. It is not even properly understood as a relation between governors and the governed. Rather, solidarity is a category of the political understood in Schmitt's terms as rooted in the distinction between friend and enemy. The relation between political friends is that of solidarity.

February 3, 2006 in Announcements | Permalink | Comments (3) | TrackBack Beating an Undead Horse: Imagining the New Left Imagining Sadly, I came to the SDS party too late to provide much of a reasonable comment; the moment to do so, the moment in which a comment might have been effective, might have offered something productive, had passed. This is, in some ways, what the entire argument revolves around, the notion of a history that is at once both concrete and unbound, both nuanced and simplistic. If Scott had not believed that the moment for theatre and symbolic politics had passed, perhaps that the moment should never have existed in the first place, I doubt he would have written his initial post. Had not many at LS been cheered by the SDS being reconstituted, born anew, and that this rebirth marked a time that had come, perhaps there would be no need for Charles' rejoinder. Let's think of this as the first impasse, or the first tension. The second is equally obvious, but nevertheless deserves additional investment. Scott embraces a form of leftist politics that is - I don't know what he wants to call it, but for the sake of convenience - pragmatic. He wants a politics of the left that, like those of the far right, transformed the political organization of the left (which I assume he means the Democrats?). The SDS strikes him, and others, as a symbolic politics, at times &quot;purely symbolic,&quot; at other times merely &quot;symbolic.&quot; Either way, these sorts of New Left theatre, these playful interventions that are tantamount to pragmatic concessions within the political arena, are to be disdained. Others feel differently. At stake is what might be understood as the substance or essence of the symbolic (Jon has taken it in this direction). That's one way to look at it, though I want to propose that this tension, though it owes much to Scott's imprecise (and indeed, malformed) deployment of the term, makes less sense within the register of the symbolic and more within the register of the imaginary. A long post follows.

But what had the Kranke who wrote that bizarre passage ‘the master-slave dialectic’ been reading? It had always puzzled me, until recently when I managed to fill in one more piece in the jigsaw. Sure, I thought, there’s some Hobbes in there, this is some account of the founding of society out of a state of nature, individuals giving up some of their liberties for peace? And maybe there’s some Rousseau there too, the “One thinks himself the master of others, and still remains a greater slave than they” of The Social Contract. Much later someone put me on to Schelling’s System of Transcendental Idealism of 1800, and its discussion of recognition of self by other. But only this week did I realize all this only makes sense in the light of Fichte’s Science of Rights (1796). This is Fichte as doppelgänger, the guy who could be so fearlessly monological in the Wissenschaftslehre (1794) has done an about-turn by the time of the Grundlage des Naturrechts (one day I will exclusively reveal the role played in this volte face by Madame de Stäel) and is suggesting that other humans follow axiomatically from my own existence. It still reads like a deduction of otherness (when Hegel will find the other phenomenologically) but its language of ‘mutual recognition’, of the need to create ‘a community of free beings’, and of the danger of ‘a quarrel or war ending with the complete extermination of one of the parties’ is a striking precursor to the Stuttgarter. And a funny thing in the preface to my library’s 1867 American translation: A.E. Kroeger writes that the Science of Rights “ought to have preëminent interest for the people of this Republic, since what the philosopher has in it deduced as the only rational form of government has been realized and established as such here.” February 1, 2006 in Hegel | Permalink | Comments (3) | TrackBack StatCounter - Free Web Tracker and Counter Site Meter Long Sunday ‘You are reserved for a great Monday!’ Fine, but Sunday will never end.—Kafka « July 2005 | Main | September 2005 » We the vulgar In this post, Alain linked to the neoconservatism issue of Logos, and I perused much of it. There were two articles about Leo Strauss and his connections to the neoconservative movement, the first of which, “Leo Strauss and the Rhetoric of the War on Terror” by Nicholas Xenos, raises some interesting questions about what the neocons mean by the words they use. As Alain and some of the commentors cautioned, we don't want to fall for some sort of idealism here and imagine that the ideas of Strauss and of his students are really what's driving the “war on terror”; of course, if there weren't money and power in it for the monied and the powerful, these intellectuals would not be allowed to drive policy in this way. But Strauss provides an ideological framework and a language, as Xenos explains, and surely tells us what the neocons think they're doing (I wouldn't be surprised if those intellectuals imagined that they were in fact piloting the ship of state rather than some vulgarian CEOs). Based on Xenos's summaries of Strauss, the ideological framework is neither impressive nor interesting: it's The Republic all over again and, you know, I really didn't care for that one the first time around. However, this leads me to the interesting question: what the hell do these people (Kristol, Kagan, Krauthammer, Wolfowitz, Frum, Perle, Abrams, Barnes, Nafisi et al.) think they're doing?

This is even consistent with the now imfamous &quot;Reality Based Community&quot; comment from last fall's Presidential election. I have recently discovered an issue of the online journal Logos dedicated to the neoconservatives. In one of the essays, Gary Dorrien lays out a recent ideological history of the movement and focuses on William Kristol (son of Irving Kristol, the so called god father of neoconservatism). William Kristol is one of those smug talking heads that appears on Fox every Sunday, is the editor of the Rupert Murdoch financed Weekly Standard, and has a Phd in Political Science from Harvard.

As such, he must attune himself to, respond to that prior world and the demands it makes. For the Greeks, says Heidegger, the world is an extended or continuous question addressed to man. Man is defined by this answerability to this address; he is beholden to that which beholds him. The presence of the non-human works to distribute across humanity a kind of ontological humility. All this (irrespective of whether it accurately ‘depicts’ the Greeks) is significant as the exact reverse of modern man. We look at, direct and interrogate the world – an interrogation always for human ends. We do not apprehend the world we represent or enframe it. We render it as a picture. The idea is that to render something as a ‘picture’ is to render it manipulable. The proverbial Lacanian mirror image: the self has slipped inside a frame and become, thereby, an object of control. To say picture is to imply frame. The picture is framed by and for us. And the frame sunders us from the world, is an immediate exemption certificate. It’s here I’d like to pause again. I wonder if the notion of the modern world picture, and its contrast to that other sense of being ‘beheld’ by the world, can productively be brought into proximity with some of what Lacan says about picturing and about the ‘gaze’ as embedded in the world outside us. For Lacan too speaks of being seen by things, by ‘points’ outside us in the world, but this within a rather different set of concerns and problems from Heidegger. So there may be no overlap here. These two ‘genres’ of thinking may be simply on different planes. Any comments welcome. August 27, 2005 in Heidegger | Permalink | Comments (3) | TrackBack Spectacles for the Gods Heidegger’s essay on the Age of the World Picture remarks on the distinction between a time when man was a spectacle for the gods, the object of a perception which was itself beyond conception, and a modernity wherein man is fundamentally the perceiver of a world that offers itself to him as or is posited as a picture. Benjamin, in his Artwork essay, also alludes to man’s former status as an object or show for the gods. Fascism, he famously remarks turns humanity into a spectacle for itself. At the same time, the gigantism of this spectacle – the rallies, the giant screens, the massive advertisements careering towards the random city dweller from the sides of buildings, magnifies man to God-like proportions. The modern citizen is miniaturised before the Olympian powers of industrial society but also watches them, agog, and lives vicariously though them. The older sense, of an inhuman presence watching humanity means that there is a dimension of existence which is incalculable, unknown, beyond your ownership or objectification. The subjective stance corresponding to this doctrine is, therefore, a kind of humility and receptivity to an Otherness which has preceded us both temporally and ontologically and which we can, so to speak, never get round the back of. If we are all, equally, objects for an inconceivable Other, we are less likely to become objects to onanother, so it goes. According to some, the place of non-human Other is supposed to be a kind of guarantee of humaneness.

The relevant point here was the use of the ‘picture’ metaphor. N. is talking about Stevenson’s Jekyll and Hyde: The fantastic side of the setting—Utterson, Enfield, Poole, Lanyon, and their London—is not of the same quality as the fantastic side of Jekyll's hydization. There is a crack in the picture, a lack of unity. So ‘picture’ here, as we might expect, stands for compositional unity, coherence, unitary perspective. It denotes a world that slots together according to certain rules. In literary terms, then, it means genre. Jekyll, says N., is a ‘A Gothic character in a Dickensian setting’. Two different genre-rules co-exist in the same story. What this does, presumably, is to prevent us inhabiting either of these genres, for each rubs up against the other and in so doing ‘shows’ itself. Each genre is thrown into relief against the other and therefore ‘denaturalised’. As a reader, we ‘don’t know where we are’. The element of willed deception (‘yes, I agree to inhabit this generic world’), of imaginary security, is foreclosed. Ignore, for the time being, whether this is a satisfactory comment on Dr.J&amp;Mr.H. The reason it attracted my attention, in composing my Lacan related post (which may nor may not see the light of day), was this notion of the ‘crack in the picture’ as a place where different compositional or ‘generic’ fields rub up against one another and cancel one another out. Each is put ‘out of joint’, and so, simultaneously, is the spectator. And this little example, it seemed to me, might be a useful analogy in talking about the ‘gaze' in Lacan. For when N. talks about the ‘crack in the picture’, it is in that such cracks or folds that Lacan locates what he calls the gaze, at least as I understand it. This is where the gaze nestles. And the gaze is what puts the spectator’s world ‘out of joint’. The ‘picture’ conceived as a compositional unity, presumably reaffirms the pov for which the picture is composed. The crack or fold, in disturbing that unity, at once renders that pov incomplete and implies, albeit negatively, another place of seeing, however empty or hypothetical. That’s all I have to say for the moment. In fact, I am saying practically nothing, merely soliciting comments. Consider this post a prelude to some other thing.

Email Address: jholbo@mac.com Posts by John Holbo Friday, April 07, 2006 Gospel of Judas Posted by John Holbo on 04/07/06 at 06:21 AM From the NY Times: An early Christian manuscript, including the only known text of what is known as the Gospel of Judas, has surfaced after 1,700 years. The text gives new insights into the relationship of Jesus and the disciple who betrayed him, scholars reported today. In this version, Jesus asked Judas, as a close friend, to sell him out to the authorities, telling Judas he will &quot;exceed&quot; the other disciples by doing so. I like this bit: &quot;The codex has been authenticated as a genuine work of ancient Christian apocryphal literature,&quot; Mr. Garcia said, citing extensive tests of radiocarbon dating, ink analysis and multispectral imaging and studies of the script and linguistic style. There’s something Proustian in the idea that all apocrypha ages into genuineness. (All these old people looking so dignified.) Or possibly I’m very wrong about that. But the notion that nothing exceeds like excess is so Zizekian that, in the Event, I must implore Adam Kotsko to discuss this textual revelation. But it’s so Philip K Dick that we must allow non-Zizekians to have their fun as well. Excerpts here [pdf]. You’ve got to love the story for the names, which seem to me vaguely Pynchonesque: It moldered in a safe-deposit box at a bank in Hicksville, N.

Presumably anyone else who is interested can join. The occasion for all this was - in a very loose sort of way - criticisms of me for not doing enough close reading of major ‘theorists’ in the course of my periodic grumblings against theory; or Theory, as you like. This is presumably why I have been slated to “set out some stakes at the outset.” At the risk of jumping the gun, let me quote the opening of the main proposed reading, “Scattered Speculations on the Question of Value”. One of the determinations of the question of value is the predication of the subject. The modern “idealist” predication of the subject is consciousness. Labor-power is a “materialist” predication. Consciousness is not thought, but rather the subject’s irreducible intendedness towards the object. Correspondingly, labor-power is not work (labor), but rather the irreducible possibility that the subject be more than adequate - super-adequate - to itself, labor-power: “it distinguishes itself [unterscheidet sich] from the ordinary crowd of commodities in that its use creates value, and a greater value than it costs itself” [Karl Marx, Capital, Vol. 1, 342 translation modified]. The “idealist” and the “materialist” are both exclusive predications. There have been attempts to question this exclusivist opposition, generally by way of a critique of the “idealist” predication of the subject: Nietzsche and Freud are the most spectacular European examples. What do you take the first four sentences to say? What is the character of the indicated opposition between ‘idealism’ and ‘materialism’? And what do you take to be the warrant for the first sentence in the second paragraph? As you might guess: I have my doubts. But I’m curious what others make of it. Some of the things I think I’ll say about the essay as a whole depend on what one makes of the opening. So that’s why I’m jumping the gun.

It so happens I haven’t read any of them. That means I’ve been spending too much time blogging. Let me comment briefly on his Kazuo Ishiguro review (since I have read three Ishiguro novels, just not this one.) Adam says it’s not so impressive - minor and slight and not really new. The thought pops into my head that when ‘literary’ novelists try their hand at SF, this frequently happens: they produce something lukewarm and a bit disappointing ... especially with the ‘not new’. There may be reasons for this, but I won’t bother speculating before we take a survey. Let’s make a list of ‘literary’ authors - that is, authors well-known for non-SF - who have tried their hand at SF. What one would hope for, of course, would be that this lot would come in and show up the weaknesses of the genre, which Adam ticks off nicely: “we all know how much of the SF backlist is worryingly conventional, unadventurous: written in functional grey prose (or worse, in Thoggish cliché); structured according to a frankly 19th-century model of set-up, linear or interleaved plotline development and climax; populated by cookie-cut ‘characters’ that barely deserve the name, feeble types from Joseph Campbell’s cardboard supply.” But it seems to me that SF is perhaps ‘made new’ from the inside, rather than by authors who clearly know how to avoid these problems moving in and showing how it’s done. (This is an incredibly vague thesis, to which I am not strongly attached.) Next, Tim Burke has a pungently-titled response to Mark’s Comp Studies piece: but, typical Burke, “Your Assignment: Turd in the Punchbowl&quot; turns out to be about fairness for all - as it should be. I don’t want this post to be about that (though please feel free to be fair) so I will say no more. But I will draw attention to Tim’s sole commenter, one Nicole, who writes: “As a philosopher I am always perplexed when attending talks in other disciplines precisely because there seems to be so little engagement with what was said. However, I have been told by others that philosophers are rude, and that they can’t believe how mean we are to one another. I agree with your final statement, but I suspect that my disciplinary standards for being professional and generous in intent are liable to conflict substantively with those of other disciplines.” This is a very interesting sociological observation. Perhaps I will take it up later.

The premises are all wrong but the conclusion happens to be right. In the spirit of generosity, let me accentuate the positive: “John Holbo thus becomes, paradoxically, the most faithful of all adherents of the Higher Eclecticism, precisely through his (apparent) betrayal of literary study into the hands of quantitative methods.” Well, OK, so it all goes terribly wrong after the ‘precisely’. Nothing Zizekian has ever been precise, nor is that a conceivable state of affairs. But the suspicion that my assaults on the Higher Eclecticism are due to anxiety of influence and/or narcissism of small differences is, I think, substantially correct. In my defense I make this point in the conclusion of the latest version of my mock-Platonic dialogue (available on request). But that isn’t much defense. What can I say? I’m a decadent romantic at heart. So this shot hits my battleship. But the rest is clean misses. But I think he did that for verisimilitude. Such a kidder he is. (Lest any of you others hold my confession against Scott K., who is defending my honor, I refer you again to the fact that Adam’s premise set is a deplorable mess.) Permanent link • (14) Comments Electra Press - Will Work For Whuffie, part II Posted by John Holbo on 03/26/06 at 09:39 AM I linked to Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s Big Idea post just before our book event. It probably got sorta buried. She has another post up. We’re beginning, of course, from the assumption that academic publishing is in disarray and in need of new and workable solutions. One potential path toward a solution, and the focus of this meeting, is the formation of an electronic press. That’s from the first post. From the newer post: But given that one of our hopes is to spend this meeting thinking about what happens when academic writing becomes fully networked—and not least what kinds of conversations among scholars might spring up in the process—we thought we’d begin our discussions now, online. The message of that newer post is pretty much: we’re serious, this thing is going to happen. I certainly hope to do my part. Let’s start by asking the most basic question. Why is an electronic press an appropriate response to academic publishing in disarray?

Posted by John Holbo on 03/23/06 at 08:31 PM Our Armstrong event is a bit ... quiet. Well, here’s something: Brown resolved to become a writer when he read Sidney Sheldon’s The Doomsday Conspiracy while vacationing in Tahiti. “Up until this point,” he writes, “almost all of my reading had been dictated by my schooling (primarily classics like Faulkner, Steinbeck, Dostoyevsky, Shakespeare, etc.) and I’d read almost no commercial fiction at all since the Hardy Boys as a child.” The Sheldon book was a revelation, swift and merciless where Shakespeare, etc., had been slow and cumbersome. “[L]ife seemed to be trying to tell me something,” Brown notes, adding, “I began to suspect that maybe I could write a ‘thriller’ of this type one day.&quot; What follows is an intriguing account of how novels think ... or whatever. “Brown has done a lot of thinking about what makes a successful Dan Brown thriller. He has found that it requires a few essential elements: some kind of shadowy force, like a secret society or government agency; a “big idea” that contains a moral “grey area”; and a treasure.” On a more serious note, and at the risk of dragging a serious question down into Dan Brown ridiculousness, I’d like to compress and generalize a question from my first post. Basically, I critique Armstrong for putting forth a big chunk of unsupported metaphysical speculation about the constitution of the human subject, and for failing to consider possible counter-examples. CR responded that offering counter-examples to this sort of hypothesis is “cranky,” and that Armstrong’s position is “uncontroversial.” This is two points but they really reduce to one because - well, you can imagine what I’m going to think. It has something to do with ‘theory’. But first I should state explicitly: I’m not confident Armstrong herself would appreciate this defense being offered on her behalf. It makes her book one big Tholian web argument. (Me: this elaborate attack is easily disrupted by the least bit of defense. CR: but the target is defenseless. Me: then why bother with such an elaborate attack?)

Then, a generous spot of close reading. (I’ll transcribe some long passages, in part just so our readers have a bit more actual Armstrong to consider, in reading these reviews.) Armstrong discusses two things: 1) the formation of ‘modern subjects’ and, by extension, a considerable swathe of material that might be lodged under the heading ‘political and social theory’; 2) British novels. My first concern is that the desire to talk about both induces speculative exaggeration: British novels cause modern subjects. This is never asserted baldly. But rather than being judiciously qualified in some definite way, it seems to me the novels-cause-subjects thesis is - at just those points where its speculative character might look questionable - withdrawn into vagueness or exchanged for bland trivialities. (No one will deny that British novels have had effects on people, for example.) Armstrong equivocates about key terms like ‘fiction’ and offers cumulative rhetorical nudges amounting to serious question-begging. My second concern is that many allegedly distinguishing features of the ‘modern subject’, according to Armstrong, seem to have been discussed in (for example) Plato. Which does not speak well for the thesis that these features are caused by British novels. True, you can find everything in Plato if you squint. So I hope I won’t just be overplaying that old ‘nothing new under the sun’ card. My point will be: Armstrong is not distinguishing strong from weak candidates for the status of ‘truly novel features of the modern subject’ - whether caused by novels or not. Since I am going to focus on shaking the overall philosophical frame, I am probably going to sound extremely ill-disposed towards the book. Actually, it has quite a number of nice bits; particular observations about particular works. But I thought a good shake was in order.

Kathleen Fitzpatrick has a post up on a new Institute for the Future of the Book blog. It’s been set up to seed discussion in advance of an Institute meeting - I’ll be there. So chat about electronic publishing, already. There are also a bunch of interesting posts at if:book, the Institute’s main blog. For example, this one about google and Amazon’s likely e-book offerings. The point: use of these offerings is likely to be restricted. It seems to me it is precisely these pressure points - “discuss quote share make notes make reference build upon” - that should be the focus of academic discussions of e-publishing. Academic publishing shouldn’t try to beat either google or amazon at their games. But it can beat them in these areas as a successful ‘gift’ culture. And that’s what it should try to do. Also, I note that the Institute has some post-docs. Might be fun for some of you.

Posted by John Holbo on 03/11/06 at 07:20 PM That was the subject line. Which makes me think maybe I’m starting to get spam intended for Kenneth Rufo. (See this old comment in a funny old thread.) I like the idea of of a spam-flogged product that, instead of dangling the tired old prospect of engorgement/enlargment, promises to expand you in totally new, previously inconceivable ways. Viagra for the soul. The text of the email reads, in part: “A strange spasm shook him, as if he heard fingernails scrape a slate, but as I gazed at him in wonder” - and then it cuts off. Do you think it worked? Perhaps there could be a SF story about dimensional identity disorder (on the model of the more familiar, gender variety.) Anyone else read any good spam this week? Permanent link • (6) Comments Thursday, March 09, 2006 If we shadows have offended ... Posted by John Holbo on 03/09/06 at 07:41 AM Having pondered Adorno’s echter-than-thou indictment of Mickey Rooney, we may as will consider Karl Kraus’ similar attacks on Max Reinhardt, director of that 1935 film I like so much. I quote from Wittgenstein’s Vienna: Kraus considered Reinhardt’s theatrical techniques a kind of glorified sleight of hand, an extravaganza intended to divert the audience from the quality of the drama. In Reinhardt’s hands, a theatrical production became a mere spectacle and an exercise in deception, for all the embellishments served only to distract the audience from what they had come to see - actors creating the realm of fantasy before their very eyes. “In earlier times, the decorations were made of cardboard and the actors were genuine. Now,” Kraus lamented, “the decorations are beyond any doubt real, and the actors are made of cardboard.” (p. 82) Permanent link • (2) Comments Wednesday, March 08, 2006 Minima Maturia Posted by John Holbo on 03/08/06 at 08:02 AM In light of my recent praise of Rooney, Lawrence reminds us of Adorno’s attack. &quot;Synthetically produced physiognomies show that the people of today have already forgotten that there was ever a notion of what human life was. For centuries society has been preparing for Victor Mature and Mickey Rooney. By destroying they come to fulfill.&quot; So this is the time to confess that I’ve also blogged about Victor Mature. No one left comments (sniff). I thought it was so funny, in a Dave Moles sort of alternate history way. Because the kids. love. bathing machines. I set this observation off in its own post, lest serious Adorno conversation decline into Esther Williams jokes, which is always the danger. My two cents worth is that Adorno’s attacks on American popular culture are so knee-jerk condemnatory, so unrecoverably tipped over into polemic, so essentially incongruous - Adorno cast as Ahab, howling Schopenhauerian pessimism at the black abyss of Culture Industry as Will; strike through the Mickey Rooney mask! [cut! take two!] As I was saying: when he gets in these moods, when he fails to distinguish between personal irritation and Hegelian insight, when he drags the hems of the robe of his philosophical high-seriousness through the mud of his gloom, he really gives you that Barton Fink feeling. Cue John Goodman: &quot;I’ll show YOU the life of the mind!&quot; Adorno is a great stylist, but - in his underground man-like collisions with American culture - he missed his calling, which was somehow to migrate into a Nathanael West novel and serve as the object of some cautionary tale. Another bit, from that notorious jazz essay [I’m quoting from Prisms]: &quot;However little doubt there can be regarding the African elements in jazz, it is no less certain that everything unruly in it was from the very beginning integrated into a strict scheme, that its rebellious gestures are accompanied by the tendency to blind obeisance, much like the sadomasochistic type, described by analytic psychology ... &quot; The epistemology of that ‘no less certain’ is classic. Cue John Goodman again: ‘Because you don’t LISTEN!’&quot; And one more bit. Add ‘pop’ to ‘culture’, change ‘Veblen’ to ‘Adorno’, ‘mote’ to ‘beam’, and you’ve got a half-decent self-portrait: “For him all culture becomes the distorted image of naked horror. His fascination with the impending doom explains and justifies the injustice he does culture. Culture, which today has assumed the character of advertising and was never anything for Veblen but advertising, a display of power, loot, and profit. With splendid misanthropy he ignores everything that goes beyond this. The mote in his eye becomes a means of perceiving the bloody traces of injustice even in images of happiness.” Really I like Adorno quite a bit. In his honor, I have posted another J&amp;B film still. Permanent link • (23) Comments Page 1 of 10 pages 1 2 3 &gt; a</span></p>

It was sitting in a dusty warehouse near a place I&#39;m visiting in Maryland, USA; a hardback signed with an imposing yet readable scrawl.  Fifty dollars marked down to $16.  I&#39;m still looking, sadly, since I know that I can get a paperback for half that.  Did you know that there is no copy of this book anywhere within the library system of western and central Massachusetts?  (Perhaps their filing system is confused because they refer to him as &quot;Roberts Adam Adam Charles&quot;.)</p></span>

Like a Pain</strong> All this talk of slippers reminds me of the importance of shoes. If Texas is slippers then California is a pair of classic black Adidas Samba . Adi Dassler first produced running and football (a.k.a. &quot;soccer&quot;) shoes in 1925. They proved popular. Jesse Owens wore ancestral Sambas when he dominated Berlin's &quot;Hitler Olympics&quot; in 1936. Dassler first produced Sambas by name in 1950. The origin of that name is unclear. Did the German want his soccer shoe to appeal to legion South American soccer fans? Did he somehow anticipate the emergence of the then 10 year old Pelé into wordwide celebrity? Did he think a dance equal part imported African rhythms and native Brazilian beats a perfect inspiration for a footballer's fleet feet? The Internet refuses to reveal Dassler's reasoning. The point is that Jesse Owens laughed at Hitler in these shoes, Pelé tied legs in knots in them and I wear them everyday no matter what. I wear suit and Sambas. Pinstripes and Sambas. Tuxedo and Sambas. They bring a little class to jeans and a little déclassé to formal wear . . . just like I bring a little class to a crawfish boil and a little déclassé to Cotillion. What can be more déclassé than a samba at Cotillion? A pair of them. (ducks) As I prepare to attend the MLA by reading an enthusiastic but idiotic number of essays by scholars whose panels I will attend I must come to terms with the brute fact that Sambas may not fly at the MLA. I decided to buy some dress shoes. I purchased identical &quot;Black Smooth&quot; and &quot;Cognac Smooth&quot; Nunn Bush &quot;Fielding&quot; oxfords on clearance. I am breaking them in by having them gnaw though my ankles and saw through my Achilles tendon chafe by painful chafe. Blood is everywhere. Some guy in New Jersey screams about the humanity. As I crumble to the floor in flames little people jump from my cabins to their deaths. Others slip on the blood slick floor and are either engulfed by my hydrogen-enhanced conflagration or crushed to death beneath my white-hot hulk. Like I said: If Texas is slippers and California is Sambas then Washington D.C. is heels and ankles rubbed raw and badly bandaged while sporting patent leather oxfords only a masochist could love.</span></a></div>
