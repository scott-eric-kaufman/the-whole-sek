			<p>I apologize for the lack of posts lately, but since I sent in my  
absentee ballot, the election&#39;s lost a little luster for me. Turns out  
that voting ruins elections.</p>
<p>Go figure.</p>
<p>That said, look forward to much more on <em>Game of Thrones </em>from  me in
 the near future. I&#39;ve already written the posts, I just can&#39;t  publish 
them yet because my students are on to the fact that I post my  lesson 
plans <em>before</em> I teach them, which has resulted in a truly frightening situation in which they <em>actually</em> know everything I&#39;m going to say before I say it. So I have to hold those back until after class on Tuesday. (<em>Grumble</em> stupid students being responsible <em>grumble</em>.)</p>
<p>But  my students are still blogging, and they&#39;re producing all sorts 
of  interesting material. I assign them 1,000 words a week, 500 of which
 I  script for them via a prompt, the other 500 they&#39;re free to write  
whatever they want so long as it includes the course&#39;s critical  
vocabulary. Last week I covered the neuroscientific argument about <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/mise-en-scene.htm#54569" target="_self">frontality</a>, the short version of which <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/09/game-of-thrones-winter-is-coming-for-will-and-bran.html#more" target="_self">I discussed here</a>,
  and now I have students who can&#39;t stop seeing faces everywhere.  
Including one particularly bright apple whose free post this week  
concerned <em>Prometheus</em> in a very interesting way. He began by  
noting that the film opens with an intelligent designer ceding its DNA  
to fertilize the Earth—the pun was intended in the original—and that the  first scene in the film that includes humans opens thus:
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/prometheus00003.png"><img alt="" height="207" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/prometheus00003-300x125.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="prometheus00003" width="498" /></a></p>
Seems
  innocuous enough, right? But according to my student, Ridley  
Scott—whose name is but an inverted &quot;d&quot; from being &quot;Ripley Scott,&quot; as my
  student pointed out—wanted to remind viewers that this was a seeded  
world with this shot. How so? By including evidence of intelligent  
design in the rock features:
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3ce60fff970c-popup"><img alt="Prometheus00003a" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3ce60fff970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Prometheus00003a" /></a></p>
<p>See how sad that rock is? <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/prometheus00003b.png" target="_self"><em>See</em></a>? It&#39;s this sad:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c32b78654970b-popup"><img alt="Prometheus00008a" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c32b78654970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Prometheus00008a" /></a></p>
<p>Just tilt Mr. Intelligent Designer man about 35 degrees to the left and you&#39;d have Mr. Sad Rock:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee45b4909970d-popup"><img alt="Prometheus00008b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee45b4909970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Prometheus00008b" /></a></p>
<p>I&#39;m  not sure I buy this argument—and strongly suspect that I may 
have  overplayed the frontality hand—but I can&#39;t help but admire the 
pluck of  this close-reading, especially given the fact that stretched 
as it  is, it does conform with the overall (and problematic) logic of 
the  film, which is all about, as the audience is informed immediately 
after  Mr. Sad Rock makes his appearance, the existence of &quot;the same  
configuration&quot; appearing across Earth and the universe. I informed my  
student that this was an impressively terrible argument—far too  
overdetermined to be correct—and he responded by saying I should put it 
out  there for others to decide. I warned him about what happens on the 
 wilds of the Internet, but given that he&#39;s taken legitimate points 
about  frontality and merged them with a solid accounting of the film,

In this case, because such rock formations are rather unusual, I think it is simply meant to evoke the pre-human landscape that we just got finished seeing.  In contrast with the millennia-old rock, however, the sudden presence of humans in the shot conveys (to me, at least) that they&#39;re almost intruders, or at the very least a surprising (miraculous?) addition to the mise-en-scene.</p></span>

I&#39;d urge the student to look for other clues, though--the point about the face seems overdetermined.  Could he tone down the claim a bit?  One (very old) argument for intelligent design looks for evidence of construction and planning in the features of the natural world.  Perhaps the perfect &quot;placement&quot; of the rock features--the fact that they appear like sculptures that could not *possibly* have been produced by chance-- could be read as an argument for ID?</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;d prefer that students overdo it rather than underdo it any day!<br />

I do it all the time. I'll be standing there talking to a woman only to be stricken by the sudden and irresistible urge to stare at her breasts. She'll register her discomfort by pulling her lapels close or yanking her plunging neckline chin-high. Then she'll become intensely interested in objects in the general vicinity of her feet. But I won't let that deter me. I'll continue to stare at her breasts until she won't be able to take it anymore and informs me in tones of suppressed outrage that she had some important elsewhere to be fifteen minutes ago. Then she'll never talk to me again. Such is the experience of the deaf man in America today. When the eyes of a hearing man break contact and wander south, the obvious conclusion is the correct one: he is staring at her breasts and she is justifiably uncomfortable. When a deaf man who relies on verbal cues and lip-reading to converse lets his eyes drift south of his conversant's, he stops at her lips. (You can tell because if he didn't—that is, if he actually stared at her breasts—he would have no clue how to answer whatever it is she would have said to him while he indulged in some &quot;covert&quot; sexism.) Why mention this in the one forum this commonplace of deaf life will never make anyone uncomfortable? Because I've acquired another rude habit: Talking to people while wearing headphones. People who know me—for example, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Barry Siegel—won't bat an eye when I talk to them with my headphones on because they'll know that I'm reading their lips and not paying attention to the music. They'll know that I'm so invested in the conversation that I've forgotten that I have the headphones on and have merely neglected to remove them. But other people—for example, the inimitable Gay Talese—will look at me horrified as I chat with Barry without removing my headphones. His eyes will rebel against the solipsistic impertinence of youth culture he detects in my actions. I register his discomfort but, blinded by reputation and desperately trying to impress him, I won't understand what it is I've said that so offends him. I'll rifle my brain for the offensive statement the entire walk home and come up empty. Only later that night, as I force myself to stop thinking about the events of the day, will I realize what I've done. And then? So much for sleep.</span></a></div>
