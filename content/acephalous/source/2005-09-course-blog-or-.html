(Why I had insomnia after a night of feigning a prodigious drunk baffles me. Had I imbibed an abnormal amount of high-octane alcohol last night I would no doubt have passed out like a petrified log. Instead I stood giant like the sequoia, surveying the vast expanse of consciousness that lay before and behind me and praying for an illegal timber outfit to clear-cut me out of my misery. But I dendro-digress.) In Spartan, Robert Scott belongs to the government agency involved in the operations. As the film opens, the woman being chased by the man in the woods passes the seated Scott. The man sees Scott then looks at the woman. The woman stops running and shrugs. Scott turns to the man. Says You've had your whole life to prepare for this moment. Why aren't you ready? The man claims he is and runs after the woman who seeing the man resume chasing resumes fleeing. Cut to the military barracks. The woman loudly informs Scott of her prowess with knives in close quarters. Scott: What they got you teaching here young sergeant? Black: Edged weapons sir. Knife fighting. Scott: Don't you teach them knife fighting. Teach them to kill. That way they meet some son of a bitch who studied knife fighting, they send his soul to hell. Then things happen. The truck is driven. The helicopter piloted. Now Scott leads the task force to find the girl. The girl had been kidnapped. The government official named Burch corners Scott: Burch: What about if we had to go off the meter? Scott: The door is closed sir. Burch: I need to ask you to do something. Scott: I am here to get the girl back sir. And there is nothing I will not do to get the girl back. Eventually the only native speaker of Mametese (William H. Macy) arrives. The shots are fired and the credits roll. Perhaps I exaggerate Mamet's desire to create a conspiratorial mood via the definitive article. Perhaps. But in Spartan this technique works to spectacular effect. Mamet employs a variation of the technique Hugh Kenner attributes to Samuel Beckett: Two men waiting, for another whom they know only by an implausible name which may not be his real name. A ravaged and blasted landscape. A world that was ampler and more open once, but is permeated with pointlessness now. Mysterious dispensers of beatings. A man of property and his servant, in flight. And the anxiety of the two who wait, their anxiety to be as inconspicuous as possible in a strange environment (&quot;We’re not from these parts, Sir&quot;) where their mere presence is likely to cause remark. It is curious how readers and audiences do not think to observe the most obvious thing about the world of the play, that it resembles France...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/this_will_have_.html"><span><strong>This Will Have Been the Poem Post; or, Anti-Socialist Doggerel and the London Scholars Amused by It</strong> I'm not normally a fan of poetry—some sapiens whose fallow fields ain't all too fallow are born into ambiguity and live contentedly &quot;within&quot; the ken of such conveniently aesthetic interpretations their whole life long .... but seeing how I ain't numbered 'mong them this ought to ring truer than the Virgin's very own words—so I hereby proclaim that even infides like I find the following doggerel infinitely entertaining. (Consider that your special stamp o' approval.) It is called &quot;Mother Jones Melodies&quot; and comes from the 18 April 1906 issue of the wildly popular satirical Puck Magazine. To contextualize this moment a bit, this poem and its corresponding cartoon would've been in print shortly after Jack London (already wildly successful and widely scorned for The People of the Abyss and a lecture-circuit-sensation) published his revolutionary socialist novel The Iron Heel and Upton Sinclar (ever the practical man) had published his muckraking of the meat-packing industry, The Jungle. I mention the latter because it sits upon the desk in the cartoon (immediately to the left of the hoppin' mad elfin figure who represents .... someone?) and the former because its composition and publication are (in London's mind) integral to his vacation on the Isle of British Poverty (recounted in The People of the Abyss). But you're not interested in all this dry dusty history! On to the poem! The &quot;poem&quot; (subtitled &quot;For the Kindergarten School of Socialists&quot;) reads: Pussy Cat, Pussy Cat, where have you been? I've been to Jack London to hark to his chin. Pussy Cat, Pussy Cat, what did he say? &quot;Blow h—l out of everything—smash, burn and slay!&quot; Not that London would not have said that (or much, much worse, by which I mean yelling &quot;EVERYTHING IS FINE! RETURN TO YOUR SEATS!&quot; in a burning theater). And not that London wouldn't have juxtaposed it for maximum effect, as this author unwittingly does in his or her sad shot at satire. What London never would have done was jump up and down and wave his arms and stamp his feet and let a cat—because if ever a man was a dog or wolf man, Jack London was a dog or a wolf man—tell him what someone as important as Jack London had said. London knew better than to trust a cat. Cats lie. They claim to have not been fed when they can hardly stand for belly-bulge. They claim to have no water when the bowl (which is not the slowly dripping bathroom tap) overbrims with fresh filtered water. London knew better than to allow a cat even one all gussied up in stripes and scarves to tell him the who-for or what-not. My point? You want my point?!? Were I not bound the by strictures of the Dissertators' Code I would have to admit that that cartoon and its accompanying nursery rhyme are damn funny.</span></a></div>
