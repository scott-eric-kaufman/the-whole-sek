Mitchell and evolutionarily-influenced historical romances about the Revolutionary War.&nbsp; I don't think they ever released the soundtrack to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=redirect%3Flink_code%3Dur2%26tag%3Ddiesekoschmar-20%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D9325%26path%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.amazon.com%252Fgp%252Fproduct%252FB000BCE90O%22%3EWilco%3C%2Fa%3E%26%2360%3Bimg%20src%3D%26%2334%3Bhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.assoc-amazon.com%2Fe%2Fir%3Ft%3Ddiesekoschmar-20%26amp%3Bl%3Dur2%26amp%3Bo%3D1%26%2334%3B%20width%3D%26%2334%3B1%26%2334%3B%20height%3D%26%2334%3B1%26%2334%3B%20border%3D%26%2334%3B0%26%2334%3B%20alt%3D%26%2334%3B%26%2334%3B%20style%3D%26%2334%3Bborder%3Anone%20%21important%3B%20margin%3A0px%20%21important%3B%26%2334%3B%20%2F%26%2362%3B"><em>Johnny Tremain</em></a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" />.&nbsp; Not that all those drums and fifes and bugles would bear repeated listenings . . . </p>

<p>And I like to listen to an entire CD several times, read through the liner notes, get a feel for it. Who has *time* for that kind of thing anymore?</p>

		<span id="comment-13085213-content"><p>A musicologist friend said to me recently that, having finished two journal papers, a conference paper, a lecture series and designing and writing an entire new undergraduate paper, she was really looking forward to listening to some music. It was (she said) almost as bad as when she was doing her doctorate: three years without listening to any music at all...</p>

<p>And yet we do notice that the undergraduates seem unable to work without music playing. Have they learned a new way of partitioning their attention?</p>

<p>Personally, I can&#39;t do it. Nor do I see the point. If it&#39;s good music, my attention is taken by it. If it&#39;s bad music, my attention is taken up by disliking it. If it&#39;s mediocre music, why waste neural cycles on it? </p></span>

		<span id="comment-13091019-content"><p>TheInnerSanctum, I&#39;m not above liking a perfectly executed show which just happens to a remake of a total crap show...and the new <i>BS</i> comes damn close to being perfectly executed as anything I&#39;ve seen on television, well, ever.  The acting&#39;s superb.  As is the writing.  As is the soundtrack (mentioned above).  As is the concept.  If you haven&#39;t watched the remake because memories of the original frighten you off, I highly recommend a mind wipe and watching it <i>tabula rasa</i>.  You&#39;ll be impressed, I assure you.</p>

<p>AW, I&#39;m with you on &quot;experiencing a newly purchased CD,&quot; and haven&#39;t done so <i>in years</i>.  With two Wilco exceptions, that is.  To be honest, the only albums I can kind of sort of work to are the last two Wilco albums, but that&#39;s really only because I&#39;ve listened to them so often I can hear them without paying attention to the lyrics.  (I know, I know: First <i>Battlestar Galatica</i>, now Wilco.  How much more predictable can I get?)</p>

<p>Jamie, I haven&#39;t tried Rilo Kiley while cleaning (and, in a sure sign of the impending demise of my hipness, had them pegged in my head as Rilo <i>Kelly</i>), but if that&#39;ll help leave vacuum-cleaner tracks in my carpet, I&#39;m game.  Also, I can&#39;t help but admire the desire to produce music, since the last time I had that I was single, lonely and prone to sing along to Grant Lee Buffalo albums with the lights dimmed low.  </p>

<p>Michael, I&#39;m increasingly convinced that multitasking is a myth, especially since I used to do it all the time, but now realize how terribly I engaged all my tasks when I &quot;handled them&quot; simultaneously.  Cleaning and driving I&#39;ll buy.  Writing and reading, I&#39;m not so sure.  Especially not writing, because, as you say, you don&#39;t want to waste neural cycles when all of them should be revved for the task at hand.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-13099930-content"><p>I don&#39;t know about all this.  Cranky old me.  I *need* music on all the time.  Right now: disc two of a Joe Meek box set, a creepy little 50s number called &quot;Angela Jones&quot; by the creepily named Michael Cox.  So while I&#39;m typing this, part of me is inhabiting Meek&#39;s odd Twin-Peaks-avant-le-lettre aural geography.  I&#39;m in a pretty pink prom dress, but nobody knows I just -- I know! -- killed my best friend Janey so I could steal her boyfriend Bobby.  All that and I can still type!</p>

<p>I do think the right soundtrack is important.  When I&#39;m writing my dissertation, it&#39;s gotta be hip-hop.  I need the beats, the thick blobbing of verbiage -- but I also need to chain smoke and pound Dr. Pepper, so I&#39;m not a good model for the life of the mind.  I can safely say, though, that British garage act The So Solid Crew has been a faithful accompaniment to the three chapters I&#39;ve written so far.  Along with Wu Tang&#39;s *W* and De La Soul&#39;s *3 Feet High and Rising* and Jay-Z&#39;s *Black Album.  Maybe my dissertation will include a sountrack album.  And now with iTunes, I have 15,476 songs, or 39.8 days worth of music, at my fingertips.  You never know when the formal complexity of a Judee Sill song will give you the insight into how Frank Stafford&#39;s poetry works.  Or something like that.  </p>

<p>Reading is another story.  Here&#39;s the story.  When I was reading for my general exams, which involved a wide variety of texts from Old English to now, I remember sitting in my boxers one morning in the 98 degree summer heat, with Japan&#39;s The Ruins blaring from my speakers, reading *Wuthering Heights*.  That put the KONG in incongruous, all right.  But it worked.  Somehow the sheer violence of the music brought out the brutality of the novel, while the heat made Maryse Conde&#39;s Caribbean revision of the novel finally seem feasible to me.  </p>

<p>Sure, music requires attention.  But what&#39;s also great about music is that it&#39;s a clear rabbit/duck phenomenon.  Put De La Soul on your headphones, kick back, and enjoy the loppy complexity.  Put it on in the background, take out your 600 bar napkins with notes, and start typing a chapter about Toni Morrison.  Without music in the background, I&#39;ll just be distracted by rattling pipes, screaming kids, barking dogs, rattling kids, barking pipes, screaming dogs, and other environmental hazzards.  I also find that I can shake my ass in my desk chair while typing -- and keep the beat.  Take that, people with tenure-track jobs and completed dissertations!</p></span>

		<span id="comment-13125037-content"><p>I can sympathize with about the getting hooks stuck in your head.  I&#39;m very prone to Ohrwurmer (the German name for this phenomenon; don&#39;t the Germans have a name for EVERYTHING?).  What makes it even more maddening is that it&#39;s often not even an entire song, but just a small portion of it.  For instance, I have a line-up of two second snippets of 70s songs due to those infomercials for those song collections.  </p>

<p>Oh, and Battlestar Galactica rocks.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-13133494-content"><p>Funnily enough, I&#39;ve been &#39;rediscovering&#39; music recently - last night, for the first time in what feels like years, I lay in bed and just *listened* to Billie. I generally wake up to <a href="www.bbc.co.uk/radio3" rel="nofollow">Radio 3</a> and have that playing sporadically during the day, while doing dishes or cooking, but am finding where I used to find Bach an inspiration - his precise, methodological yet breathtaking music almost a golden mean to aspire to while dissertating - I work better in silence nowadays, much for the same reasons you&#39;ve stated. I find academic reading almost an impossibility with music now (this is tragic for someone who truly believes in the concept of the reading soundtrack). While writing, only sometimes, and it has to be on the scale of a symphony, otherwise I feels it detracts from the flow. </p>

<p>Every now and then when I sing around the house, I find it a bit startling that I can. Needless to say, I&#39;m waiting for this dissertation to give me my life back.</p></span>

A quick study of the English department demonstrates how insufficient Jones' list is. He ignores, for example, Blake Allemendinger, who wrote a book with the word &quot;labor&quot; in the title. What of Christopher C. Baswell, so invidious a liberal he withholds his interests for fear of conservative backlash but includes his middle initial in his name. Who does he think he is? John F. Kennedy? We know he wants to be. Then there's Lynn Batten. A woman. Need I say more? Ali Behdad? Ali? Anti-semite. King-Kok Cheung is 1) a foreigner, 2) a graduate of UC Berkeley and 3) interested in gender. Gender. Why not call this &quot;English&quot; Department what it is? The Department of Destroying the Nuclear Family. I thought I had found an ally in Michael Colacurcio, author of &quot;A Poise of the Spirit,&quot; until I saw he had also written Doctrine and Difference. Doctrine? Fine. But Difference? That sounds like multiculturalism to my American ears. I'm sure he and Alicia Gaspar de Alba stay up all night discussing &quot;Chicano/a Art&quot; and giggle like little brown girls during Cristina's commercial breaks. What about Rachel Lee? Dual appointment with English and Women's Studies. How do you spell &quot;me-search&quot;? At UCLA you can also spell it M-C-H-E-A-C-H-E-R-N or M-C-H-U-G-H. &quot;They will never take our FREEDOM&quot;? Not if these two Scottish &quot;rebels&quot; have their druthers. But Ms. Lesbian Lee and the Department's Scottish Feministas haven't cornered the radical leftist market on attacking the sanctity of marriage. Anne Mellor wrote an entire book on Women's Political Writing in England. Were there not enough men to study, Ms. Mellor? Or could they not stand the stench of your tangled, unwashed pits? Jinqi Ling, an illegal immigrant, writes Marxist propaganda in classic diversity double-speak: Ideology and Form in Asian American Literature? Go back to China, Ms. Ling! No American wants to hear about your precious Chairman Mao. I could attack this den of anti-American activists for the rest of my life, but the wife says the brisket's done. Little Nancy and Sally are setting the table as I speak. How do you think all those queers, foreigners and women would respond to that? Bet they wouldn't even know where to start.</span></a></div>
