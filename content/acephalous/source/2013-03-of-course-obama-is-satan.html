The deep set eyes! The wide nose! His ears aren’t visible but surely they’re identical too! Except they aren’t. This is why I force my students to pay very close attention to the actual frames they’re analyzing instead of relying on an uncritical sense of what’s being represented on screen.

There are significant differences: Ouazanni’s cheeks are sunken, whereas the President’s are puffed; the shape and presentation angle of their nostrils is completely different, etc. In other words, a simple description of the features of their face makes it possible to believe that they look somewhat similar — or that, as many on the right are arguing, Ouazanni looks like an older version the President.

			<p>Whether you believe that Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni, the man portraying Satan in the Hitler Channel’s adaptation of <em>The Bible</em>, <a href="http://weaselzippers.us/2013/03/18/wonkette-history-channel-saying-all-black-people-are-the-devil-with-obama-look-alike/">looks</a> <a href="http://wonkette.com/506975/totally-great-the-bible-mini-series-explains-that-barack-obama-is-the-debbil">like</a> <a href="http://mypetjawa.mu.nu/archives/215434.php">President</a> <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2013/03/why-does-devil-in-bible-look-exactly.html">Obama</a>
 depends on a number of factors, foremost among them your familiarity 
with people of other races. If, like many white conservatives, the 
majority of your interaction with people darker than you occurs when you
 watch the evening news, you see this image and are <em>shocked</em> by the similarity:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/obama-satan.jpg"><img alt="" height="343" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/obama-satan.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="obama satan" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Just look at his skin! The deep set eyes! The wide nose! His ears 
aren’t visible but surely they’re identical too! Except they aren’t. 
This is why I force my students to pay <em>very close attention </em>to the actual frames they’re analyzing instead of relying on an uncritical sense of what’s being represented on screen. To wit:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/barack-satan.jpg"><img alt="" height="299" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/barack-satan.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="barack-satan" width="499" /></a></p>
<p>I chose this comparison because it’s the one in which the likeness, 
such as it is, seems greatest. It’s important to note that it’s <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/howard-portnoy/2013/03/18/history-channel-s-devil-character-looks-president-obama">from the conservative <em>Newsbusters</em> site</a>,
 meaning that it’s been selected in order to heighten the featural 
similarities between them. The President’s lips aren’t always pursed, 
and choosing an image in which they are creates some features that 
wouldn’t otherwise be there, but for argument’s sake I’ll pretend this 
is how the President always looks.</p>
<p>We’ll start our comparison with the forehead: not only is Ouazanni’s 
deeply furrowed, the muscles above his eyebrows are far more defined. 
Moving down to the glabella — the bit between the eyebrows — Ouazanni’s 
contains both vertical and horizontal furrows, whereas the President’s 
is smooth. Both have deep-set eyes, but Ouazanni’s are hooded and appear
 almost rectangular, whereas the President’s are almond-shaped. Beneath 
both of their eyes is a pronounced lower eyelid furrow which combines 
with an intraorbital furrow to create downward facing triangles on their
 cheeks. In this image, they both also have well-defined nasolabial 
furrows descending from the tips of their nostril wings out and around 
their lips to their chins, both of which are squarish. There are 
significant differences: Ouazanni’s cheeks are sunken, whereas the 
President’s are puffed; the shape and presentation angle of their 
nostrils is completely different, etc.</p>
<p>In other words, a simple description of the features of their face 
makes it possible to believe that they look somewhat similar — or that, 
as many on the right are arguing, Ouazanni looks like an older version 
the President. Except they don’t. The number of specific features a 
viewer needs to overlook — or be race-blind to — in order to claim a 
holistic similarity between the two is just too high.*</p>
<p>If you want to see a connection, enough featural similarities exist 
for you to do so, but only if you make a conscious decision to equate an
 image of Satan in a hoodie with the President. The number of 
distinctions you must overlook is equaled by the number your 
cross-racial identification bias prevents you from seeing. Factor in 
whatever intuitive model of aging you use to crease the President’s 
forehead and wrinkle his cheeks and it’s clear that quite a bit of 
cognitive processing has gone into the “intuitive” association between 
these faces. Which means you ought to ask yourself:</p>
<p><em>Why do I want to overlook these distinctions and age him in this way</em>?
 The answer, obviously, is that you want to see what you think you see, 
and are probably upset that I’ve demonstrated how your “plain 
observation” has been filtered by political and racial recognition 
biases. So much so that your rebuttal will amount not to a refutation of
 the features I’ve identified, but by linking to the image again and 
insisting that anyone with eyes agrees with your holistic judgment. As 
Allahpundit admits, he now has “<a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2013/03/18/producers-of-the-bible-miniseries-no-way-were-we-trying-to-make-satan-look-like-obama/">a new front-page thumbnail for when Obama pushes an especially terrible policy</a>.” That’s all he really wanted in the first place.</p>
<p>*I’m not saying there’s <em>no </em>resemblance. Only that judgments 
about human faces are highly susceptible to suggestion, as analyzing 
them in detail, feature by feature, demonstrates.</p>

I&#39;m not watching the series, so I don&#39;t know what he looks like without the hood, and only know the actor is from Morocco. But if he has long grey hair under that hood, I&#39;m betting Satan strikes a much different figure.</p>

<p>I&#39;m only half-following this story because it&#39;s distasteful but can&#39;t be avoided if you&#39;re online, but didn&#39;t the whole thing get started with Glen Beck tweeting out the picture? Is it just this one frame of the show that&#39;s being used to make the equation? Or does he consistently resemble Obama in a way that suggests it was purposeful? I&#39;m asking because I&#39;m not going to watch to find out. The History Channel gives me enough headaches.</p></span>

Here’s the “funny” rape “joke” that caused the fuss: As you know, Ashley Judd has recently been heard equating both mining and purchasing Apple Products to “rape.” So my commentary at CPAC on her stupid, and insensitive comparisons was exactly this “This just in, Ashley Judd just tweeted that purchasing apple products is akin to rape … from her iPhone.” Crowder was, according to himself, “Clearly taking aim at Ashley Judd for her stupid rape comments.” Which is all well and good, had the comments Judd made remotely resembled the ones Crowder attributed to her. Before getting to Crowder, let’s look at our favorite Confederate’s defense of him: By tagging Crowder as a “Fox News contributor,” the writer of the HuffPo item signaled to liberal readers that the young comic is a hate-object. It’s wrong to call Crowder a “Fox News contributor,” according to McCain, because it “signal[s]” something to liberal readers. You know who that criticism should be aimed at? The person who runs “stevencrowder.net” and identifies him “FoxNew’s brightest, funniest young Conservative mind.” Doesn’t that person know what he’s signalling? His affiliation with Fox notwithstanding, Crowder’s comment is clueless for the simple reason that Judd never claimed that purchasing an Apple product was “akin,” metaphorically, to rape. She said, according to that bastion of liberal propaganda, The Daily Caller: I am financing mass rape as I enjoy these ridiculously Global North ultra-efficiencies and conveniences, for large scale rape is the preferred predation mining interests use to humiliate and terrify local populations, in order to control resource areas. The relationship she describes there isn’t one in which purchasing an Apple product is “akin” to committing rape, but one in which purchasing material something built with “conflict minerals” makes one complicit in the brutal tactics of the regimes who mine them. The difference between Crowder’s summary and Judd’s actual statement couldn’t be more stark: he thinks she equates all evils with “rape,” you know, like liberals do; whereas she’s specifically identifying how rape is used in a particular cultural context to “convince” people to work for slave-wages. I’m not saying that Judd hasn’t made outlandish statements in the past, but this strikes me as Crowder doing what John Nolte and Jeff Goldstein and every other anti-political correctness crusader loves to do: telling jokes that white men are forbidden to tell by the dark and womanly multicultural establishment. Because it’s just as bleeding edge now as it was in ’77. [x-posted and vigorouly commented upon at LGM.]</span></a></div>

You pull and you twist; you pull while twisting and you twist while pulling all to no avail. You look at your wife and you tell her, “I’ve misplaced my wedding band.” She will look at you, j’accuse burning in her eyes, until you hold up your right hand. She will then enter the kitchen and return with the ingredients required to perform Step One: 1. Apply cold water and a little soap. Gently work the soap under the ring and twist. If the ring still does not come off, massage the area of the finger below the knuckle to remove some of the fluid from the finger. Wait a few minutes, then repeat. Continue until the finger is good and chafed. After fifteen minutes of repeated failure, your wife will walk back into the kitchen and return with the materials needed for Step Two: 2. Dry the chafed finger with hand towel, then apply the following in any order: water-based lubricants, oil-based lubricants, semi-solid fats, hydrogenated vegetable oils, as well as any lard, suet, ghee, tallow, or schmaltz you find lying around. As with the soap and water, work the slippery substance under the ring and twist and turn. Carefully slip a knife under the ring and try to slide it over the knuckle. If the ring-bearer cries in pain, ascertain whether its source is the ring jamming on the knuckle or the knife slicing into it. This too will fail. Your wife will walk back into the kitchen yet again. Take this opportunity to try to wash your hilariously lubed finger. The water-based lubricants will dissolve quickly, but the oil-based lubricants, semi-solid fats, suet, schmaltz, &amp;c. will take some time. Expect to find an oily residue scumming the top of the bucket used in Step Three: 3. Thrust your hand into the bucket of ice water which your wife has brought in from the kitchen. Leave it in there until the ring-bearer screams. When he does, shoot him a look of unconcealed embarrassment with a hint of disappointment, then allow him to “tough” it out for another three minutes. Once he passes out, remove his hand from the bucket and check to see that the desired amount of vasoconstriction has occurred, then repeat steps one and two. You may notice that despite the intense cold and vigorous oily...</span></a></div>
