If all scholarship was available online, our judgments wouldn't be influenced by who turned out to be the better popularizer. I admit that Von Post sounds like a crank and behaves like a troll.

		<span id="comment-79532625-content"><p>I don&#39;t know if I have enough annoyance left after considering current events to be annoyed by this, but it&#39;s the kind of thing that usually annoys me.</p>

<p>1.  &quot;Wow, we might all be simulated -- in fact, if anything *can* happen, it *will*, so we probably are!&quot;  People who don&#39;t read SF don&#39;t know how tired this is.  It&#39;s like how every literary writer all of a sudden rediscovers the alternate history novel.</p>

<p>2.  Von Post is really claiming to be scooped on this idea, based on a publication in Quantum Science Fiction?  In 1991?  Oh, please.  If he was publishing as an academic, it has to be in something other than Quantum Science Fiction.  If he was publishing as SF or SF criticism, it has to be something earlier than 1991.</p>

<p>3.  If someone asked an actual SF critic, such as, say, Adam Roberts -- or read his history of SF -- they&#39;d probably realize that there is no particular difference between the idea that it&#39;s likely that we&#39;re being run in a undetectable future simulation and the idea that the universe is in the mind of God.  This is just yet another SF reworking of a religious trope.</p>

<p>4.  Who knows whether they talk about the actual detectability of simulations, beyond the &quot;if we try to simulate everything within a simulation, our computer will crash&quot; nonsense.  (If you can simulate a universe, you can probably simulate someone in that universe running a simulation -- by altering the &quot;clock speed&quot;, which is undetecteable by people within the simulation, if nothing else.)</p>

<p>5.  You&#39;d think that when people revisit this chestnut they&#39;d talk a bit more about the actual example of simulation failure that we live with all the time -- dreams.  One&#39;s brain simulates reality in dreams very badly.  For instance, I used to have dreams in which I would try to read some book or message -- but my dreaming brain evidently can&#39;t make up a message quickly enough, so I would be unable to read it, figure out that this was because I was dreaming, and be annoyed within the dream.</p>

<p>6.  This reminds me that I was going to write something about <i>Polystom</i>, which addresses many of these issues, and haven&#39;t yet.  That&#39;s annoying too.</p></span>

<p><em>People who don&#39;t read SF don&#39;t know how tired this is.</em></p>

<p>Didn&#39;t Descartes cover this territory with his &quot;Evil Genius&quot;?</p>

<p><em>If he was publishing as an academic, it has to be in something other than Quantum Science Fiction.  If he was publishing as SF or SF criticism, it has to be something earlier than 1991.</em></p>

<p>That was my first response: <em>QSF</em> doesn&#39;t sound peer-reviewed.  Then I realized he posted an article <em>and</em> a short story based upon it in the same issue.  Can&#39;t claim precedence when it ain&#39;t peer-reviewed.  </p>

<p><em>This is just yet another SF reworking of a religious trope.</em></p>

<p>I think the article references Berkeley, but as per above, I think the man in question&#39;s Descartes.</p>

<p><em>I used to have dreams in which I would try to read some book or message -- but my dreaming brain evidently can&#39;t make up a message quickly enough, so I would be unable to read it, figure out that this was because I was dreaming, and be annoyed within the dream.</em></p>

<p>I frequently have the can&#39;t-read-this dreams, but they never lead to I-must-be-dreaming revelations.  Instead, they imbue the following day with high-octane frustration: &quot;I spent all night feeling stupid, and now I feel stupid too.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Who knows whether they talk about the actual detectability of simulations, beyond the &quot;if we try to simulate everything within a simulation, our computer will crash&quot; nonsense.</em></p>

<p>Also, the fact that the computer simulating our reality never crashes.  As if Microsoft won&#39;t still be around in the year 92,391 B.O.M.</p>

<p>Ahistoricality:</p>

<p><em>I will merely note my despair that such lame excuses for new ideas get so much attention.</em></p>

<p>Agreed.  Why, exactly, is this considered &quot;cutting edge&quot;?  Because it&#39;s sort of like <em>The Matrix</em>, which is only 10 years old!</p>

<p>Kurt:</p>

<p><em>The amazing thing to me is that Bostrom&#39;s article actually got published in a journal... standards for what counts as philosophical scholarship must be pretty low these days.</em></p>

<p>That the (purported) precedent for this rehashed Cartesianism is a science fiction <em>magazine</em> is telling.</p></span>

<p>Interesting.  I think that you could actually figure a good deal about a literate person by their reaction to this kind of dream-problem.  When I look at a book in a dream, I can&#39;t see it as English text -- I can&#39;t imagine a text fast enough, or &quot;quote&quot; a text from memory, but perhaps someone with really good imagination or memory could.  (Could an experienced writer write a new text fast enough while dreaming so that they could read it?)  I also can&#39;t imagine it to be in some strange alphabet that I can&#39;t read, because my visual imagination isn&#39;t good enough.  Finally, I never really seem to think that I might just be unable to read for some reason -- it&#39;s too much a part of my persona.  So the only thing left is that I must be dreaming.  It works a lot like what I&#39;d imagine as a certain kind of simulation failure.</p>

<p>The end effect is that now my dreams avoid any kind of written material, which is odd -- you spend all day reading, and then it has to have no place in your dreams.  I&#39;d guess that many people have self-censoring dreams that avoid parts of reality that they can&#39;t convincingly imagine.</p></span>
