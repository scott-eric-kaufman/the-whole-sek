<p>So I avoided <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/10/13/the-dismal-science-is-that-much-more-dismal-today/#comment-23348">these duties</a> today by defending what I’d written <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/10/12/who-really-wrote-obamas-dreams-from-my-father/">yesterday</a> from <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13422">this</a>.
I don’t know what to make of that—the anger spills from, well, I’m not
sure—but in the end, I’m blamed for present hate-mail from <a href="http://ta-nehisicoates.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/epic_failayers_ghostwrote_obamas_memoir.php"><em>Atlantic</em> readers</a> and future hate-mail from <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13422#comment-560702"><em>American Conservative</em> readers</a>. 
All because I considered Jeff Goldstein’s “disinterested” disquisition
on the relationship of ghostwriters to their subjects insufficiently
disinterested, what with it being a series of hypotheticals about Bill
Ayers ghostwriting Barack Obama’s autobiographies and all.</p>
<p>Why would I think Goldstein’s interests weren’t disinterested?&nbsp; Probably because he’s been postulating <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13401">this here</a> and <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13395">that there</a>
about Ayers’ relation to Obama’s relation to Alinksy’s relation to the
New Left and all things radical.&nbsp; Admittedly, in the post I linked
to—the disinterested “<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/theory_comics_t.html">What If…?</a>”
about Ayers ghostwriting Obama’s memoirs—Jeff didn’t speak directly to
his beliefs about Obama and the totalitarian state his victory will
usher in.</p>
<p>He spoke entirely hypothetically and disinterestedly about the sort of material James Olney wrote brilliantly about in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226628175/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Memory &amp; Narrative</em></a>—a
book I can’t recommend highly enough, for what it lacks in the
faux-theoretical sophistication of insecure blowhards it makes up with
genuine, old-school erudition—except unlike Olney, whose impetus was
either <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LhNmX63PJvsC&amp;dq=%22james+olney%22+%22memory+and+narrative%22&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=g4GXR5HE2W&amp;sig=RLtuoqJfMz0PHRj8pc-wnJpBBb0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA1,M1">Beckett or St. Augustine</a>,
Jeff felt compelled to share his wholly and entirely disinterested
thoughts about life-writing after reading Cashill’s hackneyed “<a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=76731">analysis</a>” of Ayers and Obama’s memoirs.</p>
<p>What was I thinking, connecting what he’d been writing to months to

. . . but if you can bear with me for a moment, there’s a more
important topic at stake here.&nbsp; Jeff’s commenters have sunk to a new
low:</p>
<p>Now they’re claiming <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=13422#comment-561038">UCI is a community college</a>. 
They’re making fun of the institution that made me a Doctor of

		<span id="comment-134641905-content"><p>Lack of disinterest is the least of it. Here’s the core of this according to Jeff G:</p>

<p>“If the charges are true, and Obama’s memoirs were in fact written by Bill Ayers, at least in part, than it is clear that at least in part, Barack Obama is a creation of Bill Ayers, not with respect to the historical events of Obama’s life, but with respect to how those events are presented, and how the presentation itself speaks to the “person” doing the presenting.</p>

<p>On that meta level, “Obama,” as we’ve come to know him through his memoirs, is more Ayers than he is Obama. Because from the perspective of “literariness” (if such a thing can be said to exist), the presentation is equally as important as the presented.”</p>

<p>The rest of it is one long equivocation between “Obama” and Obama, spiced with a bit of pretense that the presented Obama consists mostly of this book and not almost wholly of campaign material, interviews, and so on.</p>

<p>But the basic premise is … what? Jeff G throws around words like “ontological”, but strangely enough, no other politician has ever before been defined by his ghostwriter. When people find out that a politician used a ghostwriter, they assume that the book therefore tells you *less* about the politician, who has hidden behind a sort of screen, not more. They don’t analyze the screen, which is assumed to present some sort of pleasant picture, as the key to the Real Truth about the pol, or even his image.</p>

<p>This goes beyond sloppiness or political interest, into laughable barking-mad incompetence. Really, you’ve gone easy on Jeff G.</p>

<p>So should you engage with him further? Don’t listen to ari or Vance or Walt or me, Scott. <br />
<a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/10/12/who-really-wrote-obamas-dreams-from-my-father/#comment-23247" rel="nofollow">Listen to the wise Jpool!</a> — who was so upset that I might chide you for getting involved in yet another pointless engagement with these people that he pre-emptively chided me because he imagined that I would get on your case about it. (The reason I didn’t, by the way, is because your original post wasn’t full of proteinwisdom links. It’s worth shooting down a new wingnut story that’s coming out their propaganda caves, where their stories are created, even though their bloggers are best ignored.)</p>

<p>Not that I think that the Jpools of the world will change their minds, no matter how often they are proven wrong. But you don’t want to be one of them, do you, Scott? I mean, look at your track record with this kind of engagement.</p></span>

<p>Umbrage is the stock in trade of certain bloggers; the more political, particularly, and the site in question seems to vacillate between umbrage and high dudgeon, when they&#39;re not trading in blithering eighthwit sniping.</p></span>

That's what you know that I mean, you know?** I mean, shit, I know shit's bad right now. With all that starving bullshit, and the dust storms, and we running out of french fries and burrito coverings, but there's a solution. A three-point plan to fix everything: Number 1: We've got this guy Not Sure. Number 2: He's got a higher IQ than any man alive. Number 3: He's going to fix everything—and he's so smart, he's gonna do it all in one week. Seriously: VOTE NOT SURE 2008! (And in that poll too, you know, for whatever and stuff.) *Brought to you by Carl's Jr. **Up yours, Thers!</span></a></div>

When Christopher Buckley “bowed out” of the magazine his father founded, The National Review, I expected there to be some blowback. I didn’t expect it to be this bad—and I think tells us quite a bit about the tenor of the conservative mind at this particular historical moment. To wit: Endorsing someone as far left as Obama is about as solid a repudiation of conservatism as you can get. The argument for keeping him out of NR would be the same argument for a Christian Magazine keeping out a writer who endorsed Satan. The logic is unimpeachable: McCain may not be Christ, but Obama’s certainly Satan. Wait—did I write “unimpeachable”? There’s peaches aplenty there. This was the unimpeachable bit: Obama did not write his own books; there’s every reason to believe that William Ayers “ghosted” most or all of them. I kid, I kid. It’s in the next sentence: Obama is an Anti-American/Pro-Jihadi/Anti-Semitic/Anti-White Rascist Marxist Muslim FACT. The commenter wrote fact in all-caps. I can see a lowly “fact” being reputed, but, by the foundational laws of typography, a “FACT’ is irrefutable. See? NRO is one of the best sources for conservative thought on planet earth, and Buckley can go fly a kite, which under [Obama] he’ll have to obtain a federal and state license to own and operate. NOT KIDDING. Wait—no it isn’t. But this post is about Buckley, not Obama, and it is Buckley about whom a “BKennedy” (whose first name is no doubt “Bobby”) writes: Chris Buckley fails. And his influency in English will backlash to hurt his dad’s magazine. I know, I know: how many more fish can they stuff in that barrel, Scott? But this post isn’t about barrels or even The National Review. This post is about elitism and elites: hristopher Buckley and Heather MacDonald should mate, but have Michelle Obama offer to be the surrogate mother. Then Barack Obama can raise the child as if it were his own. They’ll name him John, in honor of Kerry, and in 30 years we’ll be blessed with the Perfect Snob. This post is about us and them, with them responding to the above comment thus: Typical black family. LOL. Which means this post is about the Culture Wars: I do know that we have NOT had 8 years of conservatism as [Buckley suggests]. And I know that electing an eloquent radical Marxist is not the way to advance the cause. It’s suicide. Good riddance to you, and Kristol, and McCain, and for that matter GWB. The hell with reaching across the aisle. Where has it gotten us? Until we recognize the enemy as the enemy, we will continue to be defeated. Make that the intra-conservative Culture War. To wit: Christopher Buckley is another super-rich elitist, who can afford to behave and say whatever he wants. No, I was right the first time. This is about the Culture War, only the populists (such that they are) are throwing their intellectual elites (such that they are)...</span></a></div>
