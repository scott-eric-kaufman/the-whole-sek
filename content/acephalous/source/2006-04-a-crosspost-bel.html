</center><p>

As I read Spivak's &quot;Scattered Speculation,&quot; I thought it strange that this text was forwarded as a counter-example.&nbsp; How could it not be considered highly eclectic?&nbsp; In tone and diction; in the allusive style of its argument; in its constant quotations from the traditional roster thinkers associated with what I'd call Theory, I could hardly think of a more illustrative example of the form.&nbsp; I was baffled.&nbsp; So I devised some scenarios.&nbsp; 

What some thought would happen:

</p><blockquote><p>As everyone surrounded the figure they believed Jesus reanimate, I required solid evidence.&nbsp; I would have to pluck the wound.&nbsp; Once done, the other apostles would be proven correct.&nbsp; Our faith would become fact.&nbsp; Spivak would not be an example of Higher Eclecticism once I engaged her work seriously.</p></blockquote><p>

What actually happened:

</p><blockquote><p>As I stood in the middle road, I could not believe that ground had opened beneath our wheels.&nbsp; I had been a passenger, brought to this fissure by another, and she seemed unconcerned.&nbsp; Unbelieving.&nbsp; She stared at me, hand on shifter, oblivious to the altered rock face behind her.&nbsp; She would never believe what had happened.&nbsp; She would insist that Spivak was not an example of Higher Eclecticism despite abundant geological evidence to the contrary.</p></blockquote><p>

In truth, she would floor the accelerator and <a href="http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2006/04/assessing_the_d.html">wax triumphant</a> when she reached her destination.&nbsp; &quot;Could you imagine such idiocy?&quot; she would say, sip her drink, then add &quot;He's probably still out there trying to convince people of the existence of tectonic events.&quot;&nbsp; She would not be incorrect.&nbsp; I <em>would</em> be out there.&nbsp; Perhaps some friends and I would wander interstates, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374518734/diesekoschmar-20">pulling over on occasion to open our eyes</a>:

</p><blockquote><p>As we could plainly see from the interstate, the rock now residing in that striped mountainside had once been brutally shoved around—shoved, not pulled, and with such force that a large part of it had been tipped up more than ninety degrees, to and well beyond the vertical.&nbsp; Overturned.&nbsp; Such violence can happen on an epic scale.&nbsp; There is an entire nation in Europe that is upside down.</p></blockquote><p>

Because what is plainly there requires no faith, only observation.&nbsp; More importantly, it never requires the faith I'll never have.&nbsp; Witness the limited, canonical field of theorists Spivak cited: Althusser, Benjamin, Deleuze, de Man, Derrida, Freud, Habermas (but only to dismiss), Jameson, Lacan, La Capra, Lyotard, Marx, Negri, Nietzsche, and Saussure.&nbsp; Were I to have hypothesized that such a representative essay existed, I would have been shouted down, compelled to present evidence of my outrageous claim.&nbsp; And yet there it is <em>in an essay chosen to disprove the existence of essays of the very sort it is</em>.

</p>

<p>As to the style of argumentation, I cannot top Spivak herself.&nbsp; In the midst of a technical if analogical discussion of how Marx's word/reality relates to Saussure's signifier/signified, she notes, parenthetically, that &quot;if this were a technical discussion where it was necessary to respect the specificity of the vocabulary of linguistics, I would not of course, equate word/reality and signifier/signified&quot; (83).&nbsp; &nbsp;That she notes parenthetically that she will not do precisely what she has just done is bad enough.&nbsp; That she immediately does it again sends my head spinning: 

</p><blockquote><p>It is certainly <em>of interest</em> that, using a necessarily post-monetary notion of Value-in-exchange, which must suggest that &quot;political economy [is]...concerned with a system of equivalence...[between a specific] labor and [a specific] wage,&quot; Saussure shows us that, even in the mother tongue, it is the work of difference that rermains originary, that even as it is the most &quot;native,&quot; language is always already &quot;foreign,&quot; that even in its &quot;incorporeal essense,&quot; &quot;the linguistic signifier...[is] constituted not by its material substance but only by the differences that separate its acoustic image from others&quot; (83).</p></blockquote><p>

I'll explain why I emphasized the phrase &quot;of interest&quot; momentarily.&nbsp; For the moment, I merely want to point to the <em>style</em> of argumentation here, one which I think typical of Higher Eclecticism.&nbsp; The initial disavowal—&quot;if this were a technical discussion where it was necessary to respect the specificity of the vocabulary of linguistics, I would not of course, equate word/reality and signifier/signified&quot;—implies Spivak possesses the ability to deploy, in a sophisticated fashion, the vocabulary of linguistics with technical specificity <em>while simultaneously unburdening her of the responsibility to do so</em>.&nbsp; Which she then does, in the next sentence, now that it allows her to appear to argue her point with more rhetorical force.&nbsp; &nbsp;I say &quot;appear to argue&quot; because she refuses to own her point.&nbsp; It is merely a thing &quot;of interest.&quot;&nbsp; 

</p>

<p>Not that I should be surprised, as earlier in the paragraph she claimed that &quot;Attention to Marx's concept-metaphor of the foreign language is interesting here&quot; (83).&nbsp; Marx's <em>actual</em> concept is not of interest, the &quot;attention&quot; Spivak will pay to it is.&nbsp; Some may say that I am paying <em>too much</em> attention to her language and not enough to her argument.&nbsp; Fair enough.&nbsp; But the same people will at other times speak to the inviolability of form and content or style and substance.&nbsp; If it is true in other cases, it must at the very least be considered plausible in this one.&nbsp; Does the style of her argument alter its content?&nbsp; Should I not take her at her word when she characterizes her language as &quot;careful&quot; (92)?&nbsp; 

</p>

<p>What should I make of the fact that, despite not discussing the objects of literary criticism, she continually refers back to what other &quot;literary critics&quot; or &quot;literary academics&quot; think about these issues?&nbsp; Should I note that the <em>implied</em> audience of &quot;Scattered Speculations&quot; and the <em>actual</em> audience of this event are not only different, but that one half of the latter denies that any such connections exist?&nbsp; Or that the same half insists that they are bored by considerations of how the audience she addresses, implicitly and explicitly, reacts to her work?&nbsp; That would mean that evaluations of Spivak's works depended on ignoring the words she writes, the arguments in which she frames them <em>and</em> the horizon of expectations embedded in both.&nbsp; 

</p>

<p>To claim that a higher eclecticism is not present in this text denudes it of meaning.&nbsp; The only option is, as Jon has suggested, to find a coherent or tenably incoherent means of defending higher eclecticism.&nbsp; One cannot continue to deny that it is not a style.&nbsp; One cannot continue to claim that it is naught but an unthinking dismissal of difficulty disguised as an intellectual complaint.&nbsp; And one cannot continue to intimate, in the absence of supporting evidence, and in the face of abundant evidence to the contrary, that the dismissal of the thought-<em>qua</em>-thought is a crypto-dismissal of a race or a gender or a sexual orientation <em>by these parties</em>.&nbsp; Perhaps others dismiss them on such grounds.&nbsp; No one participating in this debate has.&nbsp; No one participating in these debates would even think to.&nbsp; 

</p>

<p>All of which is only to say, to return with unplanned poetry to where I began, that, <em>pace</em> Caravaggio and Tansey, I see the future of these discussions thus:</p>

		<span id="comment-16617577-content"><p>Scott, two points, mainly in so far as your post bears on my role in the past week or two:  </p>

<p>1) I don&#39;t see exactly why you think the essay was chosen to &quot;disprove&quot; the Higher Eclecticism.  The essay was chosen, rather, as a common text around which the concept could be explained and debated.  As I noted, in my call for contributions, when I suggested this particular essay above all, it actually would seem rather handy for those who wished to advance the thesis of such a &quot;Higher Eclecticism.&quot;  In short, then, the point of choosing the text was rather the opposite of what you state.  </p>

<p>(This was not the only reason the text was chosen, of course, but the other reasons have little or nothing to do with &quot;Higher Eclecticism.&quot;)</p>

<p>2) Then you say that I personally have &quot;suggested [the project] to find a coherent or tenably incoherent means of defending higher eclecticism.&quot;  Not so.  Most of all in that I have still little idea of what &quot;higher eclecticism&quot; is.  Rather, I&#39;ve proposed a defence of <i>eclecticism</i>.  And put forward the beginnings of one in, now, a number of places.  Most recently, I&#39;ve termed this a &quot;lowdown and dirty&quot; eclecticism.  </p>

<p>Moreover, it should be obvious that, contra the implication of your paragraph that mentions me, I have at no point thought to defend (coherently or otherwise) &quot;an unthinking dismissal of difficulty disguised as an intellectual complaint.&quot;</p></span>

FYI: This is written in the spirit of yesterday's &quot;misogynistic&quot; post.] The vibe around [The Valve] has been terrible of late. Dismissive. Drained, nay! desanguified. Why? An unhealthy percentage of our readership responds rigidly and unthinkingly to what we publish. Constitutionally incapable of actual research, this lot prefers to think intuitively. They are frequently hostile, with bitter and ill-tempered dispositions. They flap their corrosive tongues in an attempt to dominate conversation. You heard me, ladies, I'm calling you out. I learned all about you in an article I read today: Intellectual activities unsex a woman, and she pays a high price for her intellectual life. As a result, she is prone to all sorts of nervous disorders and may become severely maladjusted. There is little hope she will marry, and, in a few cases, her intellectual activities are said to make her frigid. In any case, intellectual activities seem to make some women cold and lacking in human warmth. Of course, that only applies to our unattractive female readership, as the rare &quot;hottie&quot; (as the kids say) isn't even &quot;credible to many, and ingenious explanations are necessary to accont for her scholarly interests. Usually the explanation is some type of early psychological experience.&quot; &quot;Unattractive women,&quot; however, &quot;are perfectly credible as scholars and their interests in intellectual activities do not require any explanation.&quot; Better unspeakably traumatized than unattractive, as &quot;no greater misfortune can befall a woman than to be physically unattractive, and this misfortune of physical unattractiveness warps her soul and makes her a spiteful creature.&quot; In the article in question, &quot;Social Attitudes Toward the Professor in Novels&quot; (1961), Michael V. Belok analyzed forty novels published since 1940 in which at least one significant character was a professor. Here are the common attitudes toward male professors, listed in order of their frequency: The college professor is unworldly, impractical, and simple when it comes to the real affairs of life. Intellectual life may make him timid, shy, nervous, and repressed or it appears to attract many men of this type. The college professor who is interested in the arts is unmanly and possibly, a little &quot;queer.&quot; The college teacher is a second-rater, a man who could not &quot;make a go of it&quot; in the really important affairs of life. Belok then combines the aforementioned attitudes toward female professors with those of the male and produces a list of differences: Male college professors were usually depicted as married; the women were almost without exception, unmarried. There was a pronounced tendency in the novels fo the woman to be depicted as having some sort of emotional difficulty. It was significant that the unfavorable characterizations of women always had them as ugly women; whereas in the case of men, they might have been handsome and were still characterized in a very unfavorable manner. It was also significant that there was a suggestion that intellectual activities either made or attracted hostile and aggressive women; whereas intellectual activities were supposed to either make or attract nervous...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/the_friday_rand.html"><span><strong>On the &quot;Friday Random Ten&quot; as Found Art</strong> The &quot;Friday Random Ten&quot; phenomenon so popular among other bloggers never made sense to me. It seemed more a showcase for one's refined and eclectic taste than anything else. But as I read Jill's FRT on Feministe today, the appeal of it struck me. An FRT is a mixtape. From no one. But to you. The first two entries on Jill's FRT are: Radiohead - &quot;Life in a Glass House&quot; Ani DiFranco - &quot;32 Flavors&quot; As I read that I was immediately confused. The song which popped to mind was Ani DiFranco's &quot;Glass House,&quot; off her compelling Little Plastic Castle. The structuring metaphor is nearly identical, being that there's little difference between an anthromorphized goldfish and a person living in a glass house. Like all lyricists who are too-clever-by-half, DiFranco hits the mark or embarasses herself. On both &quot;Little Plastic Castle&quot; and &quot;Glass House&quot; she hits the mark. She takes the conceit and plays with it: They say goldfish, have no memory, I guess their lives are just like mine. And the little, plastic castle, Is a surprise every time. She refuses to let what could become a burdensome metaphor dominate the song. Same thing in &quot;Glass House&quot;: Sitting in my glass house, While your ghost is sleeping down the hall. Watching the little birds fly Kamikaze missions into the walls. Think I'm gonna stay in today, Sit on my couch and watch them fall. [snip] Trapped in my glass house, Crowd has been gathering since dawn. Make a pot of coffee While catastrophe awaits me out on the lawn. Think I'm going to stay in today, Pretend like I don't know what's going on. You wait the entire song for her to throw the first stone, but instead she insists on remaining passive. She refuses to throw the stone others are so sure she'll throw they've been gathering since dawn. As in &quot;Little Plastic Castle,&quot; in which a woman claims amnesia when she clearly refuses to hold the grudge she's entitled to hold, in this song DiFranco refuses to throw the stone she's entitled and expected to throw. (She did once write a song whose devestating consisted of the single sentence &quot;Everyone is a fucking Napoleon.&quot;) The interesting fact about this discussion is that it doesn't have a damn thing to do with the actual song on Jill's FRT. It's a confused combination of a Radiohead title and some metaphorical continuity on an eight year old Ani DiFranco album. I had made a series of interpretive leaps and now I'll never be able to think of the DiFranco songs quite the same way. Why? Because they are now inhabited by the paranoia of the Radiohead. DiFranco's admirable passivity has been infected by the Thom Yorke's lyric about a friend who wants to paper the windows of her glass house: Once again, I’m in trouble with my only friend. She is papering the window panes. She is putting on a smile. Living in a glass house. The futility of papering...</span></a></div>
