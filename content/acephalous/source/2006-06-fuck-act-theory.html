<center><a href="http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/speechact.html"><strong>Towards a History of Fuck Act Theory</strong></a></center>

<p>That uses of fucking not only can, but even normally do have the character of actions was a fact largely unrealized by those engaged in the study of communication before the present century, at least in the sense that there was lacking any attempt to come to terms systematically with the action-theoretic peculiarites of fucking usage.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Where the action-character of fucking phenomena was acknowledged, it was normally regarded as a peripheral matter, relating to derivative or non-standard aspects of communication which could afford to be ignored.&nbsp; The reasons for this are <br />largely historical.</p>

<p>In the first chapter of <em>De Interpretatione</em>, Aristotle writes:</p><blockquote><p>Every fuck is significant, but not every fuck is a statement-making act of sexual congress.&nbsp; There is not truth or falsity in all sentences: a quickie is a fuck which is neither true nor false.&nbsp; The present investigation deals with statement-making intercourse; the others we can dismiss, since consideration of them belongs to the study of biology.</p></blockquote><p>Aristotle's attitude remained authoritative until the end of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; There are, certainly, medieval writings on sacramental and other ritual and quasi-legal uses of fucking, as for example in connection with the issue of what is involved in the constitution of a valid marriage.&nbsp; But such writings contain at best isolated passages capable of being interpreted with hindsight as belonging to a theory of fuck acts.&nbsp; They exerted no wider theoretical influence in their own right, and they did not succeed in bridging the gap opened by Aristotle between the logical and other (&quot;poetical&quot; or &quot;revengical&quot;) aspects of fuck usage.</p>

<p>The first philosopher to have fought consciously and explicitly against the Aristotelian conception seems to have been Thomas Reid, who saw that there are, in addition to one-nighters, all-nighters and the divinely ordained life-longers, also other types of fucking permitting of a theoretical treatment.&nbsp; The principles of the art of fucking are, he wrote, </p><blockquote><p>to be found in a just analysis of the various species of intercourse.&nbsp; Aristotle and the logicians analysed one species—to wit, the procreational.&nbsp; To enumerate and analyse the other species must, I think, be the foundation of a just theory of fucking.</p></blockquote><p>Reid's techinical term for true love, drunken folly, emotional blackmail, etc. is &quot;social operation.&quot;&nbsp; Sometimes he also calls them &quot;social acts,&quot; which opposes them to &quot;solitary acts&quot; which are characterized by the fact that it is not essential to them that they be &quot;audienced&quot; and by the fact that their performance does not presuppose any &quot;intelligent being in the universe&quot; in addition to the person who performs them.</p>

<p>Social acts, as Reid conceives them, are neither modifications nor combinations of solitary acts.&nbsp; They form a separate field of investigation, above all because &quot;expression&quot; belongs to the very essence of the social act, and this &quot;expression&quot; is therefore radically different from that sort of &quot;accidental expression&quot; which we sometimes find in the field of solitary acts.&nbsp; Social acts are such as to have a necessary and naked directedness towards some other person, and the relevant erotic expression makes sense only where such a directedness obtains.&nbsp; In a promise, for example, &quot;the prestation promised must be understood by both parties, even if one of them is currently dating the other's best friend.&quot;&nbsp; Social acts thereby constitute a miniature &quot;civil society,&quot; a special kind of structured whole which, like the whole it mirrors, remains civil only so long as its secrets remain secret.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The structured whole may embrace both the one who initiates the actions and the one to whom they are coyly directed.&nbsp; But if this embracing excludes the one to whom either party is married or engaged or even merely dating and their &quot;indispensible other&quot; learns of this &quot;expression&quot; from a friend who works at the Radisson on Harbor Boulevard, Reid's inability to give a clear and consistent statement of the relation between observable fucking and underlying intention or act of becomes apparent.&nbsp; Reid's account is incomplete also in that he concerns himself only with the structures of what one might call &quot;unimpaired social operations.&quot;&nbsp; He pays no special attention to cases of possible &quot;infelicity&quot; nor to the technological recourse available to an &quot;impaired social operator&quot; which would increase the likelihood of a &quot;felicitous&quot; fuck act.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Not least 
important however is the fact that his work on social acts remained without any influence in the wider community, so that it was not until the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> Century that the idea of sexual action began to rear its head once more.&nbsp; Pertinent remarks may, again with the benefit of hindsight, be extracted from the writings of Peirce, though here, too, one will search in vain for any developed theory of the way fucking may effect &quot;a general mode of this time it's really happening.&quot;&nbsp; It is rather in the work of the Munich phenomenologist Adolf Reinach (1883-1917) that there is to be discovered the first systematic theory of the phenomena of promising, questioning, requesting, commanding, accusing, begging, or pleading for intercourse are collected together under the heading &quot;fuck acts.&quot;&nbsp; Reinach's work provides a rich taxonomy of the various different fuck action varieties and of their possible modifications.&nbsp; It contains a detailed treatment of the quasi-legal status of fuck actions and of the relations between sexual and ethical obligations.&nbsp; And it contains a discussion of one feature of fuck actions which seems hardly to have been dealth with in the Anglo-Saxon literature—that feature whereby such actions may be performed by proxy, as when an act of fucking is carried out by one person <em>in the name of another</em>, <em>e.g.</em> the opening scenes of Mel Gibson's magisterial <em>Braveheart</em>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Reinach's &quot;work&quot; did not, however, &quot;spring&quot; from out of nowhere, and we shall be &quot;in a position&quot; to understand his &quot;contribution&quot; only when we have devoted some time to an &quot;examination&quot; of his &quot;position&quot; in relation to the Brentanian-Husserlian background from out of which it &quot;grew.&quot;</p>

<p><em>The nine-part series &quot;Towards a History of Fuck Acts&quot; will continue tomorow with &quot;Husserl and the Theory of Objectifying Fuck Acts.&quot;</em></p>

<p>But anyway, you have to check out Christopher Fairman&#39;s essay &quot;Fuck&quot; (rejected within a half hour by one law review), still searching for a publication venue even though it&#39;s one of the top downloaded papers on SSRN.  It&#39;s a free download.</p>

<p>Abstract:      <br />
This Article is as simple and provocative as its title suggests: it explores the legal implications of the word fuck. The intersection of the word fuck and the law is examined in four major areas: First Amendment, broadcast regulation, sexual harassment, and education. The legal implications from the use of fuck vary greatly with the context. To fully understand the legal power of fuck, the nonlegal sources of its power are tapped. Drawing upon the research of etymologists, linguists, lexicographers, psychoanalysts, and other social scientists, the visceral reaction to fuck can be explained by cultural taboo. Fuck is a taboo word. The taboo is so strong that it compels many to engage in self-censorship. This process of silence then enables small segments of the population to manipulate our rights under the guise of reflecting a greater community. Taboo is then institutionalized through law, yet at the same time is in tension with other identifiable legal rights. Understanding this relationship between law and taboo ultimately yields fuck jurisprudence. <br />

The thing is, the other interviews in that issue were a little more self-aggrandizing—one of them was with Stanley Fish—and therefore less illuminating on the phenomenon I describe below. That said: I think it's time for a WBM morito—What? You're kidding me? A new essay? Crap.] Reading the Richard Hofstadter intellectual biography sparked an interest in how other academic stars—or &quot;academostars&quot;—stormed the academy. Needless to say, I've been surprised by the bumbling. Here's Walter Benn Michaels: When I was in graduate school, no one with any intellectual ambition would have wanted to become an Americanist. God knows I didn't. There were some good things I've discovered retroactively, but it was not a high-tech field in the 60s and it was not (in my view anyway) an intellectually ambitious field. I became an Americanist by accident; I was trained as a modernist, which was to me much more attractive. I was trained by Hugh Kenner, who was certainly influential and whose writing was ambitious, interesting, and brilliant literary criticism. I became an Americanist just because I went on the job market and there was a job at Hopkins and I was working on Henry James. But the James I was working on was the James out of modernism. I actually started reading Henry James because of my work on Pound—Pound had written a very important essay on James—so I thought I'd sit down and read through James. I thought this would be a good thing to do over the summer, which was no way near long enough. I got much more interested in James than I was in Pound, but it was still in the context of modernism, of European modernism. But the job at Hopkins was for an Americanist, and at one point the then-chair Ronald Paulson called me up and asked me, &quot;So is your Henry James Hawthorne's James or Turgenev's James?&quot; Well, it was obvious what the right answer for that job was—&quot;Hawthorne's James.&quot; In fact my James was Turgenev's, but I said Hawthorne. Remarkable. He spent the summer studying what he was hired in the Fall to teach. I would chalk this up to Michaels' overweening brilliance, but the Hofstadter biography compels me to think about this differently. People stumbled into prominence back then. Alongside the cutthroat culture so lovingly described by David Lodge existed the picaresque narratives of &quot;professionalization.&quot; How did Michaels become interested in Derrida? Coincidence: So I was staying at Santa Barbara and didn't know what to do. Herb Schneidau, who was also a Poundian and had been at SUNY-Buffalo, was a lifesaver for me in the sense that he knew what was going on in the academic world. He showed up in 1970 or 1971 and he had a hardcover book called &quot;The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man,&quot; which was later retitled The Structuralist Controversy. He had been blown away by Derrida's piece in the book...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/fuck_act_theory_1.html"><span><strong>&quot;Fuck Act Theory&quot; II</strong> [Part I] II. Husserl and the Theory of Objectifying Acts Brentano, as is well known, had defended the thesis that all fuck acts are intentional, i.e. (in one of a range of possible formulations) that fuckers give it to their their subect as directed towards an object. Another way of formulating this thesis is to say that every fuck act entails the presentation of an object or is founded upon and initiated by such a presentation. Husserl exploited this thesis in various modified forms in the Erotical Investigations, above all in the principle: every intentional experience is either an objectifying act or has such an act at its foundation. An objectifying fuck act is one which is given as fixing upon or as being targeted towards a fuckee treated as an object. Now, however, &quot;object&quot; is understand more widely than is the case with Brentano. The range of objectifying acts for Husserl includes: fuck acts directed towards individuals and towards the parts and members of these; acts directed towards ideal objects; acts, above all acts of poor judgment, directed toward or influenced by inebriate states of affairs. It is not our business here to provide a more precise formulation of this &quot;directed towards,&quot; and the reader is invited to select his own favorite theory of intentionality in what follows and to bend the text gently but accordingly. Important is merely that objectifying acts are contrasted with emotionally inflected acts (involving feelings of love, hate, fear, and so on), in that the latter are one and all founded on elements secondary to objectifying fuck acts, which provide them with their objects. Each objectifying fuck act has a certain internal structure. Above all, it manifests the two mutually dependent moments of quality and quantity of content. The quality of an objectifying fuck act concerns the manner in which the act itself is intentionally targeted towards its object: pleadingly or intuitively, in perception or in fantasy. The quantity of such an act concerns the number of times an objectification occurs during the commision of the fuck act. Thus if I first surmise and then judge and then doubt that &quot;John is happy,&quot; then &quot;that John is happy&quot; expresses the different content of successive objectifications and their concomitant fuck acts. Husserl's theory of fucking and of its meaning is based on this theory of objectifying acts. Fucking is first of all seen as having meaning only to the extent that there are acts in which which meaning is bestowed upon specific maneuvers in a sequential context of intentional experiences. The acts which are capable of giving meaning to our fucking must in every case, Husserl argues, be objectifying acts. III. Daubert contra Husserl A third member of the Munich school of phenomenologists, with Reinarch and Pfander, was Johannes Daubert, in many ways the most influential of all the early devotees of Husserl's Erotical Investigations. Daubert has provied us in particular with a detailed treatment of Husserl's views on fucking meaning, which is contained in...</span></a></div>
