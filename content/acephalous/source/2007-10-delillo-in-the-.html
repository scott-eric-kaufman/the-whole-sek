Philosophically, in areas that I can’t talk about, we were on different pages. This was the day, was it not, for influential men to come to sudden messy ends. People call me from the outside world all the time—they want me to negotiate everything. I’m not the person who will go out and negotiate anything, at any time, for anyone who happens to wear some sort of uniform. People don’t go to the Super Bowl for the game. Most Super Bowl games are not competitive, or good games. They go there for the event. They go there for the three-day weekend. The game doesn't change the way you sleep or wash your face or chew your food. It changes nothing but your life.

They're dying in their present form. They're just about dead as distinct units. A box, a screen, a keyboard. They're melting into the texture of everyday life. Even the word computer.

Boras might could be a run-of-the-mill agent whose rambling lectures were edited into DeLillo-speak by one of The New Yorkers' infamous dictators—but why would anyone do that? What would the benefit be? But there's another possibility: Given his legendary powers of salesmanship, perhaps Boras doesn't speak DiLillo-ese—perhaps he learned it for the exclusive purpose of sounding like someone being profiled in The New Yorker. No one actually sounds like that, of course, but Boras wouldn't know that. He'd push the hard-line and become the first person outside a DeLillo novel to speak like someone inside one. That would be some feat. Relatedly: this seems an opportune moment to play a round of Spot-the-DeLillo: Ask the weasel why he did it, boys. I punished myself by going for long underwater swims in the artifical lake, coming up gasping, the sky regarding me through misty spectacles, quire curiously. A man showed her his mutilated arm and asked for change. Milk is the subtlest of insults. Paper streamers came out of our eyes. As Jonathan noted, one of these things is not like the other.

<p>Timely post in light of Rodriguez opting out of his contract after---was it 1 second after---the end of the World Series.</p>

<p>I wonder if Boras is Rodriguez&#39;s heterosexual male life partner?</p>

		<span id="comment-88009646-content"><p>Vance, they certainly are ... but one of the things I always taught my students was that it was important to capture the voice of the subject.  This is more a case of &quot;distillation&quot; than &quot;invention&quot; or &quot;conformation to a well-noted author&#39;s prose style.&quot;  I&#39;ll read that Unfogged thread and get back to you.</p>

<p>Tim, I swear Boras was in a room with 18 lackeys, and that before Papelbon&#39;s glove hit the ground, they&#39;d 1) opted-out, 2) contacted the Angels, Dodgers, Mets, Tigers, &amp;c. and 3) consoled Alex on yet another October in which he had to watch the team he refused to go to frolic on the field.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/unambiguously-c.html"><span><strong>&quot;Unambiguously Clear, in Anglo-Saxon Prose&quot;</strong> (Note: Great minds think alike ... some just beat others by a couple hours. I blame Pacific Standard time.) Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff, responding to FEMA's staged news conference about the California wildfires: I think it was one of the dumbest and most inappropriate things I've seen since I've been in government. I have made unambiguously clear, in Anglo-Saxon prose, that it is not to ever happen again and there will be appropriate disciplinary action taken against those people who exhibited what I regard as extraordinarily poor judgment. Why resort to Anglo-Saxon prose? Scratch that. It should read &quot;Why resort to Anglo-Saxon prose again?&quot; Remember the press conference last week in which Chertoff announced Bush was coming to tour liberate California from the wrath of Grendel the wildfires: Her syndon geferede, feorran cumene ofer geofenes begang Geata leode; þone yldestan oretmecgas Geornwig nemnað ... Hine halig God for arstafum us onsende, to West-Denum, þæs ic wen hæbbe. wið wælfyre gryre.[*] Chertoff's more recent performance was slightly less impressive. According to the OED, his &quot;unambiguously clear, Anglo-Saxon prose&quot; may be unambiguous and clear, but Anglo-Saxon it ain't: I think it was one of the dumbest and most inappropriate [Latinate] things I've seen since I've been in government [French]. I have made unambiguously [Latinate] clear [French], in Anglo-Saxon prose [French], that it is not to ever happen [Middle English] again and there will be appropriate [Latinate] disciplinary [French] action [French] taken against [Middle English] those people [Anglo-Norman] who exhibited [Latinate] what I regard [French] as extraordinarily [Latinate] poor [Anglo-Norman] judgment [French]. That's too struck-through with Continental corruption to taste the Director's thick Anglo-Saxon ire. Here's his withering statement again, only now rendered pure: I think it was one of the dumbest and most things I've seen since I've been in. I have, in Anglo-Saxon, that it is not to ever again, and there will be taken those who what I as. I'm sure his drihtguman got the message loud and (unambiguously) clear. [*]Hither have fared to thee far-come men o'er the paths of ocean, people of Geatland; and the stateliest there by his sturdy band is George named ... Blessed God out of his mercy this man hath sent to Danes of the West, as I ween indeed, against horror of raging fires.</span></a></div>
