				<p>I've learned a valuable lesson: 

</p>

<p>When you pretend you're someone else, gigantic flashing signs screaming &quot;I'm pretending to be someone else&quot; won't cut it.&nbsp; For example: If you say you're &quot;<em>Not the Real</em> President Bush,&quot; you're bound to confuse <a href="http://mthollywood.blogspot.com/">some people</a>.&nbsp; &quot;Is that the real President Bush?&quot; these easily confused people will wonder.&nbsp; &quot;It says he's 'NTR President Bush,' but then again, that W.&nbsp; said there were WMDs in Iraq.&nbsp; Until I have further evidence that he's not who he says he isn't, I better assume he is.&quot;&nbsp; When they discover that you're not who you say you aren't--&quot;I linked to <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous">my</a> homepage, not <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">his</a>,&quot; you thought, &quot;surely even children will understand that there's no deception intended&quot;--they'll be hoppin' mad.&nbsp; &quot;You tricked me!&quot; they'll say.&nbsp; &quot;I thought you were who you said you weren't!&nbsp; You're banned!&quot;<br /> </p>

<p>Comment #1:</p><blockquote><p>You think you ought to read a book 'fore you write about it? No need!
Look how accurate-like a review can be by just assumin' you know what
some book's 'bout. Like that one by Dick Wright, Native Son, why I tell
you it ain't proper for a good ol' boy to lord it up all over the
impov'rished by tellin' 'em how great it is to be born American. Jus'
ain't right.</p></blockquote><p>Comment #2:</p><blockquote><p>EDIT: Mr. A. Cephalous-No-Brain-Ass-Kiss puckers up in defense of my
characterization of Sean &quot;Kiss My Ass Please&quot; McCann's &quot;scholarship.&quot;
Mr. A. Cephalous-No-Brain-Ass-Kiss thinks people should only condemn
books they've read, but then people would have to <em>read</em>
these books before &quot;suggesting&quot; that they're all puffery because the
New Deal took place in the '30s. As if! Literature can't respond to the
environment in which it's produced. If a book doesn't explicitly
mention a topic, <em>it's not in there</em>. Simple as that. Sure,
people were concerned about the government's inability to help them in
the midst of the Great Depression; and sure, that's when hard-boiled
crime fiction populated by individualistic &quot;tough guys&quot; who didn't rely
on a government incapable of helping them were popular; but does
Chandler ever say &quot;New Deal&quot;? No! The case against this
scholar-squirrel and his little ant colony is closed.</p></blockquote><p>Comment #3:</p><blockquote><p>
	FYI: <span class="hl">NTR</span> means...somethin'.&nbsp; </p>

<p>As for your new claim that you don't criticize McCann's book, only its arguments: the arguments are in the book.&nbsp; <em>Ipso facto presto chango</em>, you criticize the book.&nbsp; I've come to expect very little of you, but somehow I still expect a little more.&nbsp; </p>

<p>More
seriously: You have legitimate gripes against the profession. You don't
express them well, or knowingly, or accurately even, but you do express
them. If you spent a little time learning about the current state of

He writes endlessly about the Valve, but he never yammers.  Or if he does, his &quot;yammerings&quot; are the divine yammerings of a mind too sublime for you, with your pathetic tendency to yammer, to understand.

		<span id="comment-5632948-content"><p>Not only are the times and the spellings a-changing, so are the meanings.  As George Orwell put it in &quot;Politics and the English Language&quot; (1946):</p>

<p>In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of the political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism., question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenseless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called <i>pacification</i>. Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called <i>transfer of population or rectification of frontiers</i>. People are imprisoned for years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is called <i>elimination of unreliable elements</i>. Such phraseology is needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them. Consider for instance some comfortable English professor defending Russian totalitarianism. He cannot say outright, &quot;I believe in killing off your opponents when you can get good results by doing so.&quot; Probably, therefore, he will say something like this:<p><blockquote></p>While freely conceding that the Soviet regime exhibits certain features which the humanitarian may be inclined to deplore, we must, I think, agree that a certain curtailment of the right to political opposition is an unavoidable concomitant of transitional periods, and that the rigors which the Russian people have been called upon to undergo have been amply justified in the sphere of concrete achievement.</p></blockquote><p>The inflated style itself is a kind of euphemism. A mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outline and covering up all the details. The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one&#39;s real and one&#39;s declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish spurting out ink. In our age there is no such thing as &quot;keeping out of politics.&quot; All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred, and schizophrenia. When the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer. I should expect to find -- this is a guess which I have not sufficient knowledge to verify -- that the German, Russian and Italian languages have all deteriorated in the last ten or fifteen years, as a result of dictatorship.</p></span>

(So the metaphor breaks down. They all do.) However confused Seltzer is, Mr. Pease pays him one form of respect: the always popular intricate rebuttal of metatheoretical minutiae. Seltzer's thesis--also interesting, also too-clever-by-half-to-be-entirely-believable--argues that London's writing was governed by the logic of a &quot;body-machine complex&quot; in which bodies regulated by a Foucauldian disciplinary apparatus became awful machine-like. That makes people (and dogs) unhappy. Or, technically speaking, &quot;anxious,&quot; as in The anxiety which emanated from this scenario resides in the fear that individuals might lose the ability to distinguish between &quot;natural&quot; (sexual reproduction) and &quot;unnatural&quot; (machine reproduction). But since in Seltzer's account, the &quot;natural&quot; refers to the strategies whereby social norms are psychologically legitimized and delegitimated, the &quot;natural&quot; cannot be understood except as an effect of these processes of naturalization. The imagined threat through which the anxiety is communicated has deployed pre-existing psychic norms to police the boundary between bodies and machines. While this fantasy may have produced the competition between the &quot;natural&quot; body and the &quot;unnatural&quot; machine, it was the discourse of psychoanalysis that supplied the normative categories of the &quot;natural&quot; and the &quot;unnatural&quot; through which the body machine complex regulated Seltzer's disciplinary society. In the discourse of psychoanalysis, Seltzer finds the pre-existing meta-conceptual criteria enabling the distinction between the natural and the unnatural. All clear? No? The discourse of psychoanalysis instituted and thereafter enforced the normative distinctions--between &quot;natural&quot; and deviant disciplinary practices, between &quot;natural&quot; and pathological modes of reproduction--which at once precipitated and managed the anxieties through which the body-machine...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/project_hoae_pa.html"><span><strong>Project H.O.A.E., Part VI: Answer the Age Old Question &quot;What Is JSTOR?&quot;</strong> The (obviously) acronym'd after-the-fact Project. How to Open an Academic Essay (H.O.A.E.) continues today with a strange entry from the Journal of Historical Sociology. &quot;Social Darwinism in Anglophone Academic Journals&quot; by Geoffrey M. Hodgson begins with a description of Diego Rivera's massive 1934 fresco &quot;Man at the Crossroads.&quot;* Rivera arrayed his symbols of liberation on the &quot;colorful right of the picture,&quot; but To the darker left of the mural ar sinister battalions of marching gas-masked soldiers, the ancient statue of a fearsome god, and the seated figure of a bearded Charles Darwin. BAM! Hodgson nailed that opening. Gas masked soliders, fearsome gods, and a feeble old Darwin, leaning forward, undeserving martyr to Communist mythology. The article continues with a brief outline of the history of the term &quot;Social Darwinism,&quot; followed by this: This essay takes advantage of JSTOR an electronic database of leading academic journals in anthropology, economics, general science, history, literature, philosophy, political science, population studies, sociology and other subjects, which has become available in the 1990s. These journals are almost entirely in English and several date back to the time of Darwin. A search was made for the terms &quot;Social Darwinism,&quot; &quot;Social Darwinist&quot; or &quot;Social Darwinists&quot; in articles or reviews. I must admit, I'm overjoyed that someone (who works, according to footnote 4, with &quot;R. Bannister&quot;) has done my research for me. While it's beyond wonderful to have an organized, essentially annotated list of all the references to social darwinism in the JSTOR database, the thing about it is: I already had one. Because I had made one. So too, I suppose, had every scholar working on social darwinism since it became widely available in 1995. The pressing question for a certain unpublished academic I know is &quot;How did someone else publish my background research as a scholarly article?&quot; Equally pressing is its corollary, &quot;Why didn't my advisors recommend I submit my background research to an academic journal?&quot; *Hodgson probably meant &quot;Man, Controller of the Universe,&quot; since the almost identical &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot; had been destroyed in 1933.</span></a></div>
