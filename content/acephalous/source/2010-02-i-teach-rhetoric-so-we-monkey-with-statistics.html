		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8d52f09970b-content"><p>As a nominally trained statistician, I have to weigh in here.  I agree that the example you cite is a very small sample for a simple survey of adults.  However, I relish the opportunity to give a lesson in context to the rhetoric teacher.</p>

<p>Sometimes 52 is as many samples as you can get.  Imagine you&#39;re studying coyotes for your MS and you have 3 months in each of two years to do your field work.  How many coyotes do you think you could find and CATCH in that time?</p>

<p>Another example is human physiology/biomechanics research.  It is time consuming and expensive to get subjects to come in, particularly if you are researching elite athletes.  Can you imagine any of those Olympic athletes donating 4 months of their time to your research and let you monkey with their training?</p>

<p>So yeah, 52 seems small for that particular example, but an &quot;acceptable&quot; sample size, for publication or any other purpose is highly dependent on context.</p></span>

<p>That&#39;s completely fair, but when the context is a survey of random adults, it seems odd that an academic publication would have lower standards than the latest CNN/Gallup poll.  It&#39;s not as if there are only so many random adults out there in the world.  This was implicit in the post, and I should have said it outright: my consternation isn&#39;t with the size of the sample <em>per se</em>, but with the size relative to the amount of available data; and, in the case of any baseball career, 52 at bats is criminally &quot;modest.&quot;</p></span>

<p>Tautology alert!</p>

<p>Also, and I&#39;m surprised the statistician didn&#39;t mention this, but 52 can be a statistically significant sample if your population is small enough: if you&#39;re surveying, for example, Jewish Asianists in tenure-track academic positions, 52 would be a pretty good sample of the whole (which couldn&#39;t be more than a few thousand). </p></span>

<p>We, sir, are in complete agreement.  Sorry if I ranted.  We all have our passions.</p>

<p><i>Also, and I&#39;m surprised the statistician didn&#39;t mention this, but 52 can be a statistically significant sample if your population is small enough</i></p>

<p>I meant for my comment to at least imply something along those lines.  Oh well.  Interestingly, if your population is small enough (or your sample large enough, and your population is finite) you can get a sample that&#39;s too big.  At least, if your sample is too large a fraction of your population you start to break the assumption of independence in the case of simple random sampling.  Ten percent is often thrown around as a rule of thumb.</p></span>

The problem with the baseball example is that you&#39;re explicitly not talking about a random sample. If you were to take 52 at bats selected at random from your entire baseball career it would be a pretty good measure of your hitting ability.</p>

<p>Of course, in this case, it&#39;s unlikely that he got a random sample.</p></span>

If one is looking to survey, say, US adults, then it&#39;s perfectly fair to say that 52 is a rather small sample.  It&#39;s just that it might not be totally useless.  The single hardest thing to teach in statistics is the inherent subjectivity in making judgements about these kinds of things.</p>

<p>But while we&#39;re all thinking about this stuff, consider this: isn&#39;t it miraculous that pre-election surveys with sample sizes as small as 500 are as accurate as they are in predicting the opinions of more than a hundred million people?</p></span>

Consider the curious case of Dr. Ed Diener: Professor Diener is listed as one of the most highly cited psychologists by the Institute of Scientific Information, with over 12,000 citations to his credit ... [His] research focuses on the measurement of well-being; temperament and personality influences on well-being; theories of well-being; income and well-being; and cultural influences on well-being. He has edited three recent books on subjective well-being, and a 2005 book on multi-method measurement in psychology. Diener is currently writing a popular book on happiness ...What endowed chair does this expert in psychological metrics of happiness hold? Ed Diener is the Joseph R. Smiley Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the University of Illinois.Of course he is.* *I'm sure this joke has been beaten into the ground in the circles in which Diener runs, but those circles are neither these circles nor my circles.</span></a></div>

(Which were, to be frank, quite lame considering how extremely difficult it is to figure out when my birthday is.) Also, let me save you some time: not a single one of the results of a Google image search for my name is a picture of me, so you can stop clicking through every image of a person that search returns in the hopes that it'll be me. (Although I am flattered you clicked through to this one.) If you would like a picture of me to deface in what you mistakenly believe will be a hilarious fashion, contact me at myentirenamesquisheduplikethis (at) gmail (dot) com and I'll send you a couple. Update: if you're so inclined, feel free to scroll through those results and comment on which one you think I should be. Given this post (and the general tenor of the events chronicled here), I know what I'm voting for.</span></a></div>
