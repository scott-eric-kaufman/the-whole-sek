One Stomach</strong> Who wants to see Crazy Legs Conti? The International Federation of Competitive Eating's efforts to mainstream the sport are paying dividends. First Takeru Kobayashi's three-peat in Nathan's Annual Hot Dog Eating Contest attracts national attention, and now the 13th best competitive eater in the country--a man whose only victories came in the 2002 Big Easy Eat-Off and the IFOCE's official pancake-eating competition--is the subject of a documentary that's bound to bring the sport the same national prominence Spellbound brought to the world of competitive spelling. &quot;The thrill of victory...&quot; Some--foremost among them Alan Young--believe there's something disconcerting about the inevitable popularity of competitive eating. He finds it troubling that &quot;there is a federation dedicated ot the promotion of this activity. Competitive eating is morally problematic in a world where the hungry vastly outnumber the comfortably full.&quot; But does Mr. Young stop there? No, it's not the eating of competitive eating that bothers him... it's the competitiveness. &quot;In fact, all competitive practices are steeped in moral ambivalence. Winning a contest has little to do with moral achievement.&quot; Not that he doesn't have a point--the introduction of a competitive element into things that ought not be competitive, like sports, games, and the real world--can cause a debilitating sense of loss in the morally-sound and aptly-named &quot;losers.&quot; Defeat is defeating... but winning makes a person feel like a &quot;winner.&quot; The Toronto Star really found itself a winner in Mr. Young. I'd applaud its balls-out approach to selling papers, but the complement would undoubtedly fall flat on Canadian ears--after all, hiring writers with brains instead of ones who've been brained would be so capitalistic, so crass, so competitive and, well, so American.* *Full disclosure: I'm friends with a member of the IFOCE. For the record, Leon &quot;Justice&quot; Feingold is a morally responsible human being. Not at all the sort of amoral monster Mr. Young describes. How can you dislike a man who &quot;has solid perfomances in matzo balls&quot;? (Few sentences parse funnier.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/03/tale_of_the_fis.html"><span><strong>Tale of The Fishwife and Its Sad Fate</strong> ...sorry, got to thinking about German, so Mark Twain's &quot;The Awful German Language&quot; immediately sprung to mind. Particularly amusing is his English version of what the &quot;Tale of the Fishwife&quot; would sound like were English grammar German: It is a bleak Day. Hear the Rain, how he pours, and the Hail, how he rattles; and see the Snow, how he drifts along, and of the Mud, how deep he is! Ah the poor Fishwife, it is stuck fast in the Mire; it has dropped its Basket of Fishes; and its Hands have been cut by the Scales as it seized some of the falling Creatures; and one Scale has even got into its Eye. and it cannot get her out. It opens its Mouth to cry for Help; but if any Sound comes out of him, alas he is drowned by the raging of the Storm. And now a Tomcat has got one of the Fishes and she will surely escape with him. No, she bites off a Fin, she holds her in her Mouth--will she swallow her? No, the Fishwife's brave Mother-dog deserts his Puppies and rescues the Fin--which he eats, himself, as his Reward. O, horror, the Lightning has struck the Fish-basket; he sets him on Fire; see the Flame, how she licks the doomed Utensil with her red and angry Tongue; now she attacks the helpless Fishwife's Foot--she burns him up, all but the big Toe, and even SHE is partly consumed; and still she spreads, still she waves her fiery Tongues; she attacks the Fishwife's Leg and destroys IT; she attacks its Hand and destroys HER also; she attacks the Fishwife's Leg and destroys HER also; she attacks its Body and consumes HIM; she wreathes herself about its Heart and IT is consumed; next about its Breast, and in a Moment SHE is a Cinder; now she reaches its Neck--He goes; now its Chin-- IT goes; now its Nose--SHE goes. In another Moment, except Help come, the Fishwife will be no more. Time presses--is there none to succor and save? Yes! Joy, joy, with flying Feet the she-Englishwoman comes! But alas, the generous she-Female is too late: where now is the fated Fishwife? It has ceased from its Sufferings, it has gone to a better Land; all that is left of it for its loved Ones to lament over, is this poor smoldering Ash-heap. Ah, woeful, woeful Ash-heap! Let us take him up tenderly, reverently, upon the lowly Shovel, and bear him to his long Rest, with the Prayer that when he rises again it will be a Realm where he will have one good square responsible Sex, and have it all to himself, instead of having a mangy lot of assorted Sexes scattered all over him in Spots.</span></a></div>
