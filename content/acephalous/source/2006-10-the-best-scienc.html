Beers:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The sense that everything is connected, though the
connections may be obscured, gave urgency to the enterprise of
uncovering such connections.&nbsp; This was the form of plotting crucial to
Dickens’s work, as we can see, for example, in <em>Bleak House</em>,
where the fifty-six named—and many more unnamed—characters all turn out
to be related by way either of concealed descent (Esther and Lady
Deadlock) or of economic dependency (&quot;The dependency of one organic
being on another, as of a parasite on its prey, lies generally between
beings remote in scale of nature&quot;) .... As [<em>Bleak House</em>]
proceeds the immense assemblage of apparently contingent characters is
ordered and reordered into multiple sets of relations so that we
discover that all of them are interdependent.&nbsp; What at first looks like
agglomeration proves to be analysable connection.
</p>
<p>The unruly superfluity of Darwin’s material at first gives an
impression of superfecundity without design.&nbsp; Only gradually and
retrospectively does the force of the argument emerge from the
profusion of example. (42)</p></blockquote>
<p>
Darwin accomplished in <em>The Origin</em> what the popular explication of Pinker’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142003344/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Blank Slate</em></a> doesn’t even attempt: namely, to explain a scientific concept <em>in all its complexity</em> to a world which mostly only understood novels.&nbsp; Richard Dawkins’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199291152/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Selfish Gene</em></a> actually moves in the <em>opposite</em> direction—it is most powerful when Dawkins oversimplifies, <em>e.g.</em> when he reduces lived complexity into “memes.”&nbsp; (The Dawkins and Pinker books were also shortlisted.)&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
I suppose my bias shows here, but I think Darwin’s literary-scientific achievement in <em>The Origin</em> towers over the solid work of popularization, <em>The Voyage</em> included.

		<span id="comment-24555966-content"><p><i>I suppose my bias shows here, but I think Darwin’s literary-scientific achievement in The Origin towers over the solid work of popularization, The Voyage included.</i></p>

<p>As a working scientist, I must say that you are spot on - both here and in your leading remarks.  The Origin is unique in being a work of ground-breaking science as well as an exposition that can be grasped by the intelligent non-specialist.  Nothing comes close in the 20th century.</p>

<p>That said, I can suggest two books that lay out the gist of modern science without being offensive to the literate eye.  My favorite is &#39;The Einstein Theory of Gravity&#39; by Lieber and Lieber, my other favorite is &quot;Lectures on Physics&quot; by Feynmann.  Each is an accessible description of the field by an active researcher.</p>

<p>    Legitimate theory, Theo</p>
