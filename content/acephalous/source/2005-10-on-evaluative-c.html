That's the problem, I find the strangest little paradoxes of life, but no useful meaning of or for them. Comma splice? Check. Wildly inappropriate conjunctive phrase? Check. Super-sincerely felt emotion expressed via a pompous faux-philosophical soliloquy? Check. It contains all the familiar elements of a life and its concerns vomited on the page. The &quot;poetry&quot; Pinter's produced since he announced his retirement has that familiar emetic feel. So one answer to Rich's complaint—that &quot;contemporary literary studies is so far away from considering issues of quality that [there are not] any grounds for complaint that the Nobel choosing process is political&quot;—would be that poetry which excites vomition should not be rewarded with a Nobel Prize. Why does it does it have that effect? Sheer dreadfulness. The rhyme scheme? Terrible. The rhythm? Uninterestingly inconsistent. The propagandistic intent? Brazenly transparent. Combine aesthetic inaudicity with patent proselytical intent and what you have resembles neither art nor skillful propaganda so much as an adolescent discharge of undigested emotion. Does this constitute evaluative criticism? It certainly does. I find it interesting that the ear for language Pinter possessed in the '50s and '60s has turned tin since his retirement. I had always considered that particular skill permanently acquired. Pinter proved me wrong. Whatever it is about his political commitments that has caused his ear such atrophy interests me intellectually, but it doesn't validate his latter-day ejecta aesthetically. It gives them the gravitas due all talent squandered, but it doesn't compel me to read a whit more than I absolutely have to.

		<span id="comment-10407960-content"><p>Well, I know that I should never comment when half asleep.  Still, I&#39;ll give it a shot.</p>

<p>There&#39;s some missing step from your account above.  It starts with the declaration that &quot;evaluative criticism has no place in contemporary scholarship.&quot;  Then it goes into &quot;poetry which excites vomition should not be rewarded with a Nobel Prize.&quot;  But how do you know that it universally excites vomition?  (Well, I think it probably does, but stay with me.  This is a thought experiment.)  You&#39;ve said why it excites vomition in Scott (rhyme, rhythm, intent, combination of all these).  But without scholarship, do you have any reason why you can say that it should do so for the Nobel committee?</p>

<p>I can see several reasons that appear generalizeable.  Let&#39;s start with intent, with leads into aesthetic considerations.  Umberto Eco, in _The Open Work_, wrote an essay concerning kitsch.  He defined it, if I remember correctly, as art that tries to force the viewer to feel a particular emotion.  Poems like Pinter&#39;s _American Football_ would seem to meet that criterion.  Perhaps kitschiness is sort of a universally perceivable quality.</p>

<p>Or the rhyme and rhythm concerns might lead to a more technical generalization.  Something on the order of: poetry in English has rules based on the structure and content of the language, and all/most people who know English will be similarly annoyed by inept rule-breakings.</p>

<p>But these don&#39;t seem to go far enough either.  Why should literate people dislike kitsch?  Why should people have similar &quot;ears&quot; for poetry?</p>

<p>It seems to me like such statements can only be justified if you posit some essential similarity between people.  Otherwise you&#39;re really left just saying, I dislike this.</p>

<p>Well, I&#39;ve rambled about this before, but I can think of a few reasons why people might have similar artistic judgements.  They fall into the general categories of the biological, the sociological, and the cultural.  Now I really am getting too un-awake to finish this, but it seems to me that a lot of one&#39;s ability to become annoyed at overtly political artistic judgements depends on which of these you believe is responsible for judgements being more than purely personal.  The cultural end shades into politics, so that it you think that the only reason that everyone likes a certain type of poetry is because they share a certain type of high-culture education, for instance, it&#39;s hard to say why people shouldn&#39;t say that they like Pinter particularly because he breaks these rules.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-10408518-content"><p>I see the evaluative dimension of criticism as a matter of rhetorical appeal to an imagined reader of a work.  I.e., in writing an appreciative analysis, you try to convince the reader a) that the work is based upon some sort of worthwhile and interesting project and b) that it fulfills this project.  Conversely, a critical reading attacks both of these things, revealing a banal intention or an incompetent attempt to actualize it.  This appeal will be based on the assumption that your reader can be persuaded into having the same aesthetic reaction that you do (it doesn&#39;t assume that this same aesthetic reaction already exists, merely that it potentially could).  It will also be based upon scholarship - in the sense of careful attentiveness to the work and its context.  I think that this kind of appeal is implicit in virtually every literary interpretation.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-10408976-content"><p>Rich, what you&#39;re hinting at at the end of your comment is much like what Hume set down in &quot;On the Standards of Taste.&quot;  Basically, Hume argues that practice makes perfect.  The more art you experience, the more times you experience the same piece of art, the more reliable your taste.  But as Rich asks, more reliable to whom?  </p>

<p>So let&#39;s turn to review writing, which is the one place where evaluative criticism endures.  Where we&#39;re talking Pitchfork.com or the LRB, the review is fairly basic: put the work in some context, make one&#39;s criteria clear, and discuss the extent to which the work fulfills its own potential as well as one&#39;s expectations.  The bottom line here is the record review: should I buy it or not?  Should I read it or not?  Should I go see it at the Googleplex or not?</p>

<p>So what do we mean when we say that a critic&#39;s taste is reliable?  Isn&#39;t it at some level that, beyond the evaluative criteria, the reader of the review catches a glimpse of the work under review?  Through selective framing, contextualizing, and quotation, evaluative criticism goes beyond &quot;thumbs up&quot; and &quot;thumbs down&quot; and, at its best, transmits an intense dose of the reviewed object to the reader.  This is why a good portion of the best reviews are descriptive: they latch onto a key aspect of the object and re-present it to us with that focus.  Which is to say, in the act of descriptive, great reviews are creative or generative.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m using &quot;review&quot; and &quot;evaluative criticism&quot; here interchangeably, perhaps because the two have more in common than either does with academic scholarship.  But then there&#39;s another genre of nonfiction writing that often gets grouped in with the evaluative, but only because, I believe, it too is unlike academic work.  It&#39;s what we might call &quot;the writer&#39;s criticism.&quot;  Think of W.G. Sebald&#39;s discussions of art and literature in his works.  Or Iain Sinclair&#39;s.  Or Bruce Chatwin&#39;s.  Or Coetzee&#39;s.  Or Anne Carson&#39;s.  </p>

<p>Here, we aren&#39;t simply getting evaluations or &quot;thick descriptions.&quot;  What we get from writers&#39; criticism is the thrill of watching one great mind in pursuit of another great mind, of one style wooing another style.  Creative writing programs catch a lot of shit these days for producing &quot;workshop lit,&quot; but at least in my undergraduate creative writing experience, I found it liberating to be invited to write about poets and novelists in a non-thesis-driven, non-scholarly way.  This is the joy we find in reading Pater or, more recently, Ashbery on poets, O&#39;Hara on painters.  This is the joy even in reading Nate Mackey&#39;s essays, which mix the scholarly with the ecstatic.  </p>

<p>The question remains, though: does evaluative or &quot;creative&quot; nonfiction have a place in the academy?  I think it depends on how we view English as a discipline.  If we want it to mirror the sciences, then scholars of English must produce new knowledge.  If we want it to mirror the arts, then scholars of English should display in their criticism the same delicacy and sensitivity and taste as the best artists unveil in their art.  Or, simply put: when we read literary criticism, are we reading for form or content?  For the thrill of a mind at work or for usable information and accurate interpretations?  </p>

<p>Or is this a false binary, one that points at the real problem?</p>

<p>Or is this another stupid rhetorical question, desperately trying to achieve a sense of ending so that I can gracefully exit from this blog comment?  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-10414047-content"><p>Stephan: &quot;your reader can be persuaded into having the same aesthetic reaction that you do (it doesn&#39;t assume that this same aesthetic reaction already exists, merely that it potentially could)&quot;.  What distinguishes this form of criticism from propaganda?  It doesn&#39;t really seem that different from convincing the reader that they really want to buy a particular toothpaste or support a particular political party.  For those reasons, I wouldn&#39;t see any reason under this theory to criticize the Nobel committee for giving the nod to Pinter except *ineptness*; if only they had wooed us with some amazing description of how great Pinter&#39;s poetry was, the &quot;actual quality&quot; of the poetry would be immaterial, for there is no such thing.</p>

<p>The first half of Luther&#39;s comment is concerned with description that permits the readers to decide whether they are likely to think the work a good buy.  This would appear to avoid the implicit problem of assuming that your readers have similar tastes: you describe the work intensely and the description will appear attractive to some but not others.  But I think that this doesn&#39;t address the part of the review that is actually evaluative -- doesn&#39;t a descriptive criticism also exist?  And I think that the description within a review, if closely examined, will be likely to have evaluative aesthetic theories or judgements embedded in it. </p>

<p>The second part is also interesting, but I&#39;m running out of time now.  Someone more familiar with the academic environment should comment.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-10414954-content"><p>What I think about this can be presented through a sort of inverse version of the story about the blind men and the elephant.  In this version, you have a number of scientists all suffering from elephantiasis of the hands, so that their hand-waving keeps them from seeing what&#39;s really going on.</p>

<p>First up is a biologist.  &quot;We know that the capacity to aquire language is biological.  There are areas of the human brain devoted to it, and a lot of observations of the manner in which babies learn it quickly.  Language clearly provides a benefit to people who can use it with others; there would be no mystery about why such a part of the brain would evolve.  Next, I think that we can consider literary quality to be, essentially, skillful use of language.  Therefore, it appears probable that the reason that people who like literature like similar kinds of things is that the language centers of their brains are similar.  That would mean that literature truly is universal; if you brought someone to sufficient familiarity with a language and the cultural meanings of words used in that langauge, they should be able to distinguish between good and bad literature in that language.&quot;</p>

<p>The linguist is next, and decides to use the virtue of brevity.  &quot;Um, deep structure.&quot;</p>

<p>The sociologist is next.  &quot;No one finds it surprising that a society has a system of manners and of other group assumptions that permit the society to function.  So why shouldn&#39;t they have shared assumptions about literature?  It doesn&#39;t really matter what they are, as long as they help to bind the society together, provide various narratives of meaning, and incidentally provide status to certain artists and critics.  There is also an element of class differentiation between high-culture and low-culture literary values.  If this is true, we should expect that societies may differ from each other in their literary values, but that each society has one or more related, defineable ideas about which types and forms of literature are good.  Insofar as languages become identified with the most powerful societies using those languages, each language builds up its own literary values.&quot;</p>

<p>The historian chips in at this point.  &quot;I basically agree with the sociologist, but that isn&#39;t complete.  If you look at the actual way in which our current literary values were formed, you&#39;ll see various stages of influence from the literature of past societies: from Greece, Rome, the Middle East, and so on.  And in recent history various societies have influenced each other&#39;s literary values strongly according to which seemed to have the prestige of being technologically or economically advanced over others.  Therefore there should be no surprise that there is now an essentially global system of literary values.&quot;</p>

<p>At this point the literary studies person says something about how there really are no literary values.  I won&#39;t attempt a parody of the sort above; everyone here should be able to mentally write a better one than I could make.</p>

<p>One could extend this to more sub-specialties, but I think that those are the basic lines.</p>

<p>Now, it should be possible, at least in theory, to design experiments to distinguish the results of the predictions of these theories from another.  I am completely unfamiliar with what kinds of things have actually been done.</p>

<p>But it seems to me that reflective people must implicitly believe one of the types of theories above to be able to say anything about literary quality that doesn&#39;t reduce to &quot;I like this&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t like this&quot;.  The alternative is to have a conservative&#39;s theory of literary value: criteria were handed down, and all right-thinking people agree with them, and that is that. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-10416229-content"><p>Rich,</p>

<p>There is of course an element of &quot;salesmanship&quot; in literary evaluation.  However, the appeal is an attempt to make the reader see a pattern in the work, or in the work&#39;s relation to its context, that he or she may not have seen before.  This is something that critics do all the time - especially when new styles of work arise that challenge readers&#39; expectations and seem, at first glance, like nonsense.  I.e., imagine trying to teach Finnegans Wake to an undergraduate class.  There probably isn&#39;t going to be much of an underlying agreement in taste here.  You have to persuade the class first that the work isn&#39;t utter nonsense, that there&#39;s a pattern behind it and a reason why Joyce wrote it the way he did.</p>

<p>The same thing happens in the evaluation of popular art.  Within a given genre, a fan will understand the difference between good and bad work.  This understanding will be based upon his or her knowledge of the genre and of whether a writer has done interesting things given the genre&#39;s conventions.</p>

<p>The problem with your account of a universal appreciation for literary style, even your historian&#39;s one, is that it neglects the extent to which defining literary value is constantly a matter of contestation, especially in modern societies.  I.e., at this point in your conversation, your sociologist should point to Bourdieu&#39;s &quot;The Rules of Art&quot; and argue that the literary field constantly changes as artists (and critics) try to outdo each other, to promote new or previously ignored works and demote others.</p>

<p>Obviously one could try to make an argument about Pinter&#39;s poetry in this way.  I don&#39;t think it would be a very convincing argument, though.  It would probably, at some point, turn into an appeal to the reader&#39;s political sensibilities: i.e., &quot;This poem tries to say something about the bellicose mentality that underlies both football and the Gulf War.  If you think the Gulf War is a bad idea, you should like this poem.&quot;</p></span>

		<span id="comment-10418579-content"><p>Stephan, I don&#39;t think that your description of the class being taught how to appreciate Joyce necessarily conflicts with any of the possible explanations.  As Luther wrote in his reference to Hume, there appears to be an element in appreciation of practise makes perfect.  Even the biologist would say that people without brain damage have the capacity to learn language, but that they need to practise in order to develop actual skill with language.  Perhaps there are some forms of literary art that you can&#39;t appreciate until you have built up to a certain degree of understanding of complexity.  As for the &quot;attempt to make the reader see a pattern in the work&quot;, isn&#39;t this really a different form of criticism than the evaluative?  Formal and historicizing methods abound and are not generally challenged in the same way.</p>

<p>Good point about Bordieu.  Unfortunately I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m doing well enough to do more than sketch the surface of these ideas.</p>

<p>I could imagine making an argument for Pinter&#39;s poetry under several of these theories, and whether you would think that the political element was invalid or not would depend on which one you believed.  Let&#39;s say that I wrote about how forceful the poetry was, how scornful of &quot;literary&quot; values, how it rejoices in what Scott calls its emeticism and dares to be about something.  The sociologist would point to this as an implicit appeal to inverse classism, hence implicitly &quot;political&quot;.  Then the lack of sterotypically esthetic value of the poems becomes a deliberate mirror of mass culture, the criticism of the poems becomes a mirror of the manipulation of mass culture by elites, who simultaneously use it for their own purposes (the English department is keep going by all those incoming students who need to be taught) and denigrate it to keep it in its place.  Is the problem that no such convenient narrative was supplied, or that it is inherently wrong?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-10420710-content"><p>I guess the classic example of anti-art being canonized as art are Duchamp&#39;s ready-mades.  The only real problem about making evaluative arguments defending anti-art is that you can only do it so many times.  I.e., once too many artists put toilet bowls or piles of poop in the galleries, it ceases to be interesting and becomes cliche.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I think that if the Nobel Prize committee were to make an aesthetic argument about Pinter&#39;s _American Football_, they would have an easier time with it if it were, say, a Dadaist poem written in the 1920s.  By now, however, this kind of argument would be much more difficult to make persuasively, although probably not impossible (as you say, there&#39;s no limit to critical ingenuity, although I hope there are limits to readers&#39; credulity).  The poem just seems too predictable in the ways in which it is iconoclastic, which is just to say that Pinter doesn&#39;t really have his finger on developments in poetry (in contrast to the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, when he very much understood the field of avant-garde drama and crafted his plays as a contribution to it).</p></span>

More read Instapundit. I've already replaced the wheel on that counter twelve times this weekend.] Six years in California acclimates you. There I sit at the desk pictured left (albeit in its embarrassinly cluttered mid-quarter state) when all of the books I've added to the piles you see start to sway. My mind invariably turns first to the prospect of cats wrestling where cats ought not be wresting. Then I turn to the bed and see all four cats, ears perked, tales interrogative, seeking the source of this sudden shaking and it occurs to me that I'm experiencing what the natives call an &quot;earth quake.&quot; Everything slows down. Things sway slowly and ignoring the unverisal impulse to survive I shout &quot;I think the earth itself protests!&quot; The wife shouts back her quick concur and the next thing you know we're staring at each other from opposite ends of the hall thinking the same thought: Is this someone else's The Big One? It isn't. (Not today at least.) But in honor of the small one located 49 miles SSE of San Clemente Island, I present the following quotations from John McPhee's magisterial Annals of the Former World: As we could plainly see from the interstate, the rock now residing in that striped mountainside had once been brutally shoved around—shoved, not pulled, and with such force that a large part of it had been tipped up more than ninety degrees, to and well beyond the vertical. Overturned. Such violence can happen on an epic scale. There is an entire nation in Europe that is upside down. (50) The declivity was by no means sheer, just steep—a steepness, I judged, that would have caused the vehicle, had it slipped off the road, to go end over end enveloped in flame at a hundred yards a bounce. (106) On the striated pavement of Algeria lies the till of polar glaciers. there are tropical atolls in Canada, tropical limestones in Siberia, tropical limestones in Antarctica. (115) Certain English geologists produced confusion by embracing continental drift and then drawing up narratives and maps that showed continents moving all over the earth with respect to a fixed and undriftable England. (118) The swelling up of mountains was described as an orogeny. Ontogeny, phylogenry, orogeny—accent syllable two. The Antler Orogeny, the Avalonian Orogeny, the Taconic, Acadian, Alleghenian Orogenies. the Laramide orogeny. The center of the United States had had a dull geologic history—nothing much being accumulated, nothing much being eroded away. It was just sitting there conservatively. The east had once been radical—had been unstable, reformist, revolutionary, in the paleozoic pulses of three or four orogenies. Now, for the last hundred and fifty million years, the east had been stable and conservative. The far-out stuff was in the far west of the country—wild, weirdsma, with its welded tuffs and Franciscan melange (internally deformed, complex beyond analysis).

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/when_the_heart_.html"><span><strong>When the Heart Beats, Bruise It; or Part the Second of an Interminable Series on Evaluative Criticism</strong> The responses to my initial offering cloud (through no fault but my own) the issue more than I'd already managed to: Rich reaches for the universal, Luther points to the particular and Stephen goes Goebbels. To my tired eyes, I think the strongest account mashes their three incommensurable ones into a single incoherent whole: the particular qualities of a literary text woo the reader into thinking in familiar enough terms while simultaneously challenging those same terms which render them communicable. What are those terms? Why does every evaluative critic consider Shakespeare an achievement and the latest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders beneath consideration? Because both accomplish what they intend to accomplish: Shakespeare produced entertaining comedies and tragedies of value commensurate with that of his sources and the DSM-IV's multiaxial analytic guides mental health professionals through the biological, psychodynamic, cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal and familial contexts responsible for mental disease, defect or disorder. The Shakespearian corpus, however, need not correspond to reality as must the DSM-IV. This obvious but essential difference pays immediate dividends for my argument (whatever it will turn out to be) because it dispenses with the need for the creative work to refer in any empirical sense to the world. Call this &quot;the First Fuzziness.&quot; (More fuzziness, intentionally or otherwise, will no doubt follow.) Unburdened of the need to be referential, the work of literature can address whatever world it wants in whatever manner it sees fit. A work which addresses neither a recognizable world nor recognizable human relations will either be entirely unintelligible as an act of communication (think post electro-shock therapy Artaud) or a highly suggestive but never specific or entirely effective simulation. A book like Finnegans Wake has one foot squarely planted on both sides of this unintelligibility border, but one foot remains (albeit barely) within human ken. It challenges the human ability to produce and understand language without ever exceeding it. Here Luther's &quot;stupid rhetorical question&quot; becomes critical: if the critic wants to mirror the sciences, then a work like the Wake interests as a technical achievement made possible by contingent circumstances at a particular historical moment in a particular neurobiological environment; if the critic wants to parrot the arts, then a work like the Wake becomes an occasion to produce criticism in the style of the Wake (or at the very least informed by it). I think this dilemma has horns too wide for human arms. To grab one requires the other be released. This decision seems unreasonable because literary scholars imagine, by professional proxy if not personally, that the line between the two exists for one reason and one reason only: for people like literary scholars to toe. What we need then is a governing system we all feel free to violate the moment its restraints chafe more than usual. But we need the system and the restraints and the chafing for the show to whiz-bang. Now keep in mind that I'm ignoring the entire history of aesthetics here so that...</span></a></div>
