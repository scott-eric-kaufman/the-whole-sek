She did memtion that is was time to go through clothes and lighten the load because your mom is sending more home to you with her.  As long as your are in the room with Rachel, it might be nice if you surprised your wife with a clean neat room and house!</p></span>

That night, the woman logged on and wrote a glowing review of <i>Once</i>, and so did her husband.</p></span>

I was unimpressed. For I have seen Leo Kottke live twice and Jake Shimabukuro is no Leo Kottke: Fast forward to 1:00 to see the most intense guitar-face in the history of music. Of course, the song requires intensity. It's not easy to play five parts on one instrument in real-time: Still, that is some heinous guitar-face. His face not only shows the strain, he strains his cheeks expressing it. Which makes me wonder: What do I look like when I'm writing? Do I have dissertation-face? To find out, I placed a camera in the brush and set it to snap randomly, so as to catch myself unawares. (This is science. We can't have me staging science, now can we?) The result? Negligible change: I don't look a day over thirty. (And not just because I won't be until December 24th.)</span></a></div>

(Your vet probably didn't give you all the details and that's for the best.) We will see you on the 27th. Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. P.S. We had no idea this automated message would in any way disturb you. We mean, like, who gets cancer anymore? We live in The Future. That shit's been eradicated for like decades of centuries or something. P.P.S. Anyway, why would an automated message from any oncologist's office be disturbing to a cancer survivor? Are you crazy? (And how's your credit? Fine ain't it?)</span></a></div>
