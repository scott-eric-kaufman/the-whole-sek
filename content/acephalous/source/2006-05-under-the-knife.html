<p><strong>By Will Carroll</strong></p>

<p>
I’ll be honest. It’s been a good, long weekend and I have nothing for
the intro. Powered by a 1994 Glenrothes Vintage, on to the injuries:
</p>

<ul><li><p>

<strong><a href="http://baseballprospectus.com/pecota/woodke02.php">Kerry Wood</a></strong>
struck out everyone—including the peanut vendor and the visiting radio announcer—when he was in Peoria. &quot;Unhittable,&quot; one scout told me. That same scout saw <strong><a href="http://baseballprospectus.com/pecota/priorma01.php">Mark Prior</a></strong> pitch on Monday night and struggled to find words. He sighed and groaned before finally saying something I can’t print here. &quot;There was nothing right with him. No velocity (a max of 90). No command. No movement. No missed bats. No consistency—his stride was never the same and his arm was slow. If he wasn’t Mark Prior, I’d say he was at the right level. I have no idea what happened to him.&quot; Prior only went two innings before hitting his pitch count and now we’ll have to wait to see how he recovers. Not only did he show only a bit more velocity, but the absent control might be even more worrisome. Prior will have one
more rehab start at Peoria, but at this stage, it might be time to
think about slowing this down. One observer reminded me of another
pitcher who lost it—<strong><a href="http://baseballprospectus.com/pecota/hallaro01.php">Roy Halladay</a></strong>. It will be interesting to see if the Cubs can be as forward-looking as the Blue Jays once were.
</p></li>

<li>Looks like Acephalous got lucky.&nbsp; <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/"><strong>Scott Eric Kaufman</strong></a>'s injuries are severe but not career-threatening, and he could be back in six weeks.&nbsp; Other <strong><a href="http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/comments/648/">bloggers</a></strong> have recovered from serious injuries more quickly, but no one will mistake Kaufman for a quick healer.&nbsp; One doctor I spoke to compared his injuries to those a football player might suffer if they had Kaufman's frame and were tackled by a 790 lbs. linebacker.&nbsp; &quot;We see the same injuries, albeit not quite so severe, in young running backs who don't know how to take a tackle properly.&quot;&nbsp; Kaufman's been diagnosed with a <strong><a href="http://orthopedics.about.com/cs/hipsurgery/g/hippointer.htm">hip pointer</a></strong> (a deep <strong><a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/19649.htm">bone bruise</a></strong> of the pelvis caused by compressive forces), a left <strong><a href="http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/content/abstract/181/6/1511">oblique strain</a></strong> (a tearing of the of the internal oblique muscles from the undersurface of his lower ribs), and a lower <strong><a href="http://orthopedics.about.com/cs/sprainsstrains/a/lowback.htm">lumbar sprain</a></strong> (a detaching of ligaments in the lower back).&nbsp; He will return to the UCI Medical Center next week for another MRI and his first session with the physical trainer.&nbsp; Although rest is the only real cure for these types of injuries, I think Kaufman may be back sooner than anyone expects.&nbsp; UCI's doctors live on the bleeding edge of modern medicine.&nbsp; &quot;They told me to sit on <strong><a href="http://exercise.about.com/cs/abs/l/bl_core.htm">a ball</a></strong>,&quot; Kaufman told me.</li>

<li><p>

The big blow for the Phillies on Monday wasn’t another <strong><a href="http://baseballprospectus.com/pecota/howarry01.php">Ryan Howard</a></strong> bomb, it was losing <strong><a href="http://baseballprospectus.com/pecota/liebejo01.php">Jon Lieber</a></strong> to the DL. Lieber pulled up covering first—and yes, there has been a major uptick in this type of injury this season—and left an inning later. The groin strain isn’t serious, but it's certainly enough to necessitate the DL move. With a history of elbow and back problems, the Phils are right to be cautious with him, meaning they’re hoping that <strong><a href="http://baseballprospectus.com/pecota/HAMELS19831227A.php">Cole Hamels</a></strong> comes back quickly.
</p></li>

<li><p>

The Cards made the expected move, placing <strong><a href="http://baseballprospectus.com/pecota/carpech01.php">Chris Carpenter</a></strong> on the DL with a retro move. Carpenter hasn’t had any setbacks with the inflamed bursa sac in his pitching shoulder, but the roster move was necessary to keep <strong><a href="http://baseballprospectus.com/pecota/reyesan01.php">Anthony Reyes</a></strong> around. This isn’t a misuse of the DL as I often rail against. In fact, this is precisely the proper use, waiting until the last minute, having the options in place, and never penalizing yourself more than necessary. There are reasons that the Cardinals have been at the top of the division for so long. They get it, on so many levels. As for Carpenter, he should be back shortly after the minimum.
</p></li>

<li><p>

When’s the last time a game involving the Tigers was called a &quot;playoff preview&quot;? In this one, <strong><a href="http://baseballprospectus.com/pecota/jeterde01.php">Derek Jeter</a></strong> left the game early with what the team called a &quot;jammed hand.&quot; Jeter’s left index finger stuffed back into his hand, leading to some pain and inflammation, though he is expected to start on Tuesday. The Yankees are being very conservative with their stars, pulling both Jeter and <strong><a href="http://baseballprospectus.com/pecota/giambja01.php">Jason Giambi</a></strong> despite only slight problems in hopes of keeping them slight. As for <strong><a href="http://baseballprospectus.com/pecota/johnsra05.php">Randy Johnson</a></strong>, he looked great. I’m going to take a closer look at the video once it's available and see if I can find a change I missed on the original viewing.</p></li></ul>

I&#39;m sure you can come up with something, some distinguishing detail that makes this dangerous criminal...an eccentric and bloodthirsty freak.  Exaggerate, exxagerate.  It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s true.  The main thing is to seduce the cops  with the idea of this guy, and of course the glory and fame his catch will secure them.  Of the stories that will last for months.  You get the idea.  Good luck.</p>

<p>(Or, you could just focus on feeling better.  It&#39;s not like this guy has stolen anything irreplaceable of yours.)</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/the_listserv_of.html"><span><strong>The Kaufman Associate Futuro-Karmic Advance Emergency System (Quiet/Unquiet/Expired) </strong> Designed by the great-grandchildren of German V-2 engineers, the Kaufman Associate Futuro-Karmic Advanced Emergency System (Quiet/Unquiet/Expired), or K.A.F.K.A.E.S.Q.U.E., functions as a vital early warning system in the War Against Karmic Offensives committed by a previous incarnation of the current Scott Eric Kaufman. Without the knowledge K.A.F.K.A.E.S.Q.U.E. provides, the odds of Kaufman walking away from the W.A.K.O. with even a hint of sanity would be slim. Appreciation of and gratitude for the K.A.F.K.A.E.S.Q.U.E. extends beyond Kaufman himself. K.A.F.K.A.E.S.Q.U.E. red teleophones have been cunningly planted on the desks of all his W.A.K.O. allies. His parents, his friends, his advisors—even a few of his old rabbis—are alerted the instant Karma launches an attack by a distinctive K.A.F.K.A.E.S.Q.U.E. ring. They then hasten to Kaufman headquarters—a.k.a. &quot;The Castle&quot;—and learn of the latest W.A.K.O. event to mar Kaufman's otherwise humdrum existence and ponder over the offensives response for this karmic retribution. Here's the scene last Friday: Alert Level: Unquiet (almost Expired) Executive Summary: Operative #1 (codename: &quot;The Wife&quot;) estimates this latest misfortune was caused by the destruction of between an estimated 10 - 20 egregiously cute baby animals. &quot;I estimate a 78.36 percent chance that a P.S. [Past Scott] was a professional kitten strangler for a period of 8 or 9 months.&quot; Operative #4 (codename: &quot;Childhood Friend #2&quot;) disagrees. He considers this incident &quot;too animalistic to be a consequent for a human P.S.&quot; and insists that it stinks of &quot;insecticidal rage.&quot; [snip] The debate itself raged on for hours. In the end, no solid conclusions could be drawn, but everyone who needed to be alerted of the latest W.A.K.O. initiative heard the K.A.F.K.A.E.S.Q.U.E. word almost immediately after the incident occurred. Everyone left satisfied. Operative #219 (codename: &quot;The Girl From That Time on the Bus in Seventh Grade&quot;) said it best: &quot;Thank God for the K.A.F.K.A.E.S.Q.U.E. Otherwise we wouldn't have known what W.A.K.O. thing happened to Scott!&quot; [Ah, if only! Below is what I originally wrote last night. It may help make sense of what I've written above. I'm slowly coming out of the loopiness and shock of nearing being killed. I haven't thought about what would've happened had I not jumped but instead been knocked down and backed over for like 10 minutes before I wrote this sentence. As noted in my comment below, I did watch a few hours of &quot;The Dog Whisperer&quot; marathon this morning, so I'm not sure I'm 100% mentally back yet. But much, much closer than yesterday.] So now that I've had three things happen that everyone I know should know about I've come to the conclusion that I need a listserv to catalogue my misery. This isn't self pity speaking here either. I'm being entirely pragmatic. People become genuinely angry with me for not immediately informing them about some disastrous thing which has happened recently—be it &quot;acquiring&quot; cancer, having my academic career almost destroyed by horny undergraduates or being up-ended and temporarily debilitated by an indifferent driver. So I'm going to start a listserv in which I embrace my divinely...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/contrary_to_pop.html"><span><strong>Contrary to Popular Belief, Good People Still Exist</strong> [I've spent most of my day grading and doing my best Timothy Burke. Check that first link if you want to see Holbo pull out a can of &quot;whip your ass&quot; on me. Sorry. Can't resist the urge to mock Canadians.] Tonight I put away the snark in order to write about simple human goodness. That's right. I said it: Sometimes the world isn't a cruel place. Earlier this evening I returned to the scene of the pain to purchase a salad. (I've been told to walk around for at least 30 minutes a day to stretch out all the tight and torn little muscles in my back.) I hadn't even considered that walking through that parking lot would be existential torture until the Little Womedievalist said it was gutsy of me to traverse it again so soon. And I was gutsy . . . if by &quot;gutsy&quot; you mean &quot;limped through the median's ground-hugging shrubbery.&quot; So I purchased some salad and was hacking my way back through the lot when the owner of the liquor store beckoned me: Mike: Dude! What are you doing? Scott: Heading home. Mike: I see that. What's with the gimping? Scott: I got hit by a car. Mike: Fuck! That was you? At which point I exited the medial jungle and looked to my left, then to my right, then both ways, then both ways again, then limped across the lot to talk to him. Turns out the police are on the case. They've collected credit card receipts from all the stores in the complex stamped between 7:50 and 8:20 p.m. last Friday night. Apparently, they're taking this possible felony hit-and-run seriously. (When I talked to them all I was told is that they were &quot;still investigating.&quot;) I don't know what they're doing with those receipts, but I hold out hope that they're forwarding them to Vincent D'Onofrio, who will then enter the names of the credit card owners into a DMV database and determine which of them own Honda Civics. Then he'll put 'em in the box. After a few moments of professional grilling, they'll break down. If only. In the real world, I'm thankful that Mike expressed real sympathy for my plight. How do I know he did? Because he gave me a bottle of my favorite vodka gratis and a lift home. See what I mean? Sometimes the world isn't a cruel place. (cue Jimmy Stewart) Sometimes people are awful nice.</span></a></div>
