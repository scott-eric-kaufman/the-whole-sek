        <meta name="description" content="Ilya Somin's response to my London post is a nifty little walk-back, but he does have a point: “Progressive” is a general term routinely applied to all those early 20th century writers and political activists who supported large-scale increases in government control of the economy. That's not it. That is a definition so broad as to be utterly useless. The trusts &quot;supported large-scale increases in government control of the economy&quot; as a means of putting and keeping labor in its place; manufacturers lobbied first for higher, then lower, then higher tariffs; but I doubt Somin wants to include those interests among his &quot;Progressives.&quot; The point he does make is this: Perhaps Kaufman was confused by my use of a capital “p” rather than a lower-case one. I was, but only because I applied a standard that's been around for about a hundred years instead of Somin's idiosyncratic non-distinction. Those who ignore this distinction typically did so for practical political reasons, like the fellow who wrote this introduction, who wanted to include lowercase-p progressives under his uppercase-P umbrella in order to make his newly founded party look a little more substantial. I'm not saying this is a distinction universally upheld, only that it's more common than not in contemporary scholarship for the simple reason that most scholars abide by the rules of capitalization: proper nouns refer to unique entities and are therefore capitalized. The niceties of orthography are a side show, however, because the main problem with Somin's post is that he still claims that London was both spectacularly racist and, as he wrote in the first post, &quot;no anomaly among early 20th century Progressives.&quot; London's racism still only differs in degree, not kind, because as he wrote in the second post, &quot;it was part of a broader pattern of racism among many Progressives of that era.&quot; Except that it wasn't. London's atypical in all respects, and as I demonstrated in my earlier post, neither part of the &quot;Progressive movement&quot; proper and only obliquely involved in the humble-mumble of internecine conflict that defined leftist and liberal politics at the turn of the last century. But I've repeated myself. Very dull. How about we venture into the comments over there? It appears that Scott Kaufman is maintaining the faux history that progressives aren’t either fascists or socialists, when the plain fact of the matter is that they are both. Or maybe not. If elements of that crowd can't tell from my post that London couldn't have been a progressive because he believed they were insufficiently radical, the cause is already lost. But I'm a soldier, so once more into the breach: As far as I can tell, Google says that Kaufman is the only connection between “nature fakir” and Jack London. And, FWIW, that part about “Darwinian determinism” is nonsense. Seriously? The first return from Google is too far for someone to tell? What could be closer?

This is not necessarily a rhetorical questio0n. </p>

<p>I still hold a grudge about Democrats, of all people, accusing the Populists of racism. My own preliminary research tells me that almost everyone was anti-Catholic except the Catholics, almost everyone was anti-Semitic except the Jews, almost everyone was anti-black except the blacks, and everyone was anti-Chinese -- though from time to time most were willing to make  pragmatic adjustments to their principles on these questions.</p></span>

<p>Twain&#39;s anti-imperialist sentiments never turned anti-Spanish, and a whole slew of African-American writers like James Wheldon Johnson spent most of their time attacking or defending W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington from one another.  Frank Norris&#39;s depictions of migrant workers and Upton Sinclair&#39;s treatment of foreigners in <em>The Jungle</em> were both sympathetic.  That&#39;s off the top of my head, which admittedly is a bit dull after a day of reading Pierce on indexicality.  (Don&#39;t ask.)</p></span>

Racialist thinking was pretty much taken for granted amongst turn-of-the-century U.S. writers; you&#39;ll even find Du Bois in his early work making statements about the &quot;Negro race&quot;&#39;s essential good-nature, love of dance, etc., that make readers wince today.  It wasn&#39;t until Franz Boas&#39;s brilliant demolition of racialist thinking in The Mind of Primitive Man that a significant number of social scientists and other educated readers began to seriously question the idea that there are distinct races with essential, negative and positive qualities.  </p>

<p>So, yes, like virtually everyone writing between 1900 and 1910, progressives tended to make racist statements.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01348674ad5a970c-content"><p>These arguments are bizarre. One factor is that MLK has been a saint for 42 years now, and kids have grown up learning that and getting a day off school, so he has to be recruited by every political position, or at least neutralized  (just like Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln, whose actual political positions are usually ignored by people claiming to affiliate with them.)</p>

<p>Likewise overt racism is taboo, even though everyone remains a bit racist, or a lot. So &quot;racist&quot; is defined to mean a big fat tobacco chewing Southern sheriff releasing attack dogs on little children, and people are infuriated if you call them racist for anything less than that.</p>

<p>As a result of the new taboo, though, anyone can zero in on the heroes and ancestors of anyone else and prove that they were racists, since almost everyone was (and my bet is that when we do finally find a 1910 non-racist, they will be so eccentric or utopian or mystical or sectarian that no one really can claim them).</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said elsewhere, my interest in this argument comes from the way Hofstadter and others used it (along with other arguments)  to discredit the Populists and the Progressives in &quot;The Age of Reform&quot;, a book which is regarded as authoritative for a large chunk of the liberal intelligentsia. </p></span>

<p>Small &quot;p&quot; progressive is as nebulous a term as &quot;liberal&quot; is today.  But yes, reformers whom we today think of as progressives tended to distinguish themselves from outright socialists like London.  At the same time, there was significant overlap between the two groups (Doug Rossinow has a great book on this - Visions of Progress).</p></span>

Particularly annoying is the fact that Seitz discussed at length the most salient visual element of this episode, i.e. &quot;the interplay of close-ups and wide shots on the show, specifically how the camera will start very close on characters' faces, encouraging our empathy, then slowly dollying back to put them in a context.&quot; I noted this dynamic in my analysis of Peggy and Pete in &quot;The Rejected,&quot; but Lesli Linka Glatter structured the entirety of &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword&quot; around it. The one point on which I'll differ with Seitz (and Jefferson Robbins, whose work Seitz discusses there) is that with characters who are unaware of the larger context, the shots often begin wide before moving in for a close-up. When, for example, Sally cuts her hair, the scene does open with a close-up, but not one that encourages empathy: Glatter, having established the true object of the characters' attention, then pulls back behind the couch in order to create a space for Sally to enter: While it may seem as if the shot that follows works to establish empathy, the logic of the scene makes me think the decision to go with the close-up here is more pragmatic, as viewers would be unable to tell from a remove that Sally had lopped off her hair: I say that because after this close-up, the Glatter isolates her for while the babysitter frets about Don holding her responsible for Sally's actions: When the camera does return to a close-up, it does so not to create sympathy, but almost ironically: not for the last time this episode, Sally will have unwittingly done something that will cause someone else grief. The close-up emphasizes its own futility, as it demonstrates the distance between Sally and her interlocutor, be it her babysitter, her father, her mother or the man from U.N.C.L.E.: This scene will surely draw the ire (not to mention critical attention) of many, but instead of focusing on the rather tame thematic element—it turns out that even if they never watch an episode of Jersey Shore, children still experiment with their sexuality—I want to concentrate on the intimacy actually created by these shots. (If only to contradict myself a bit.) This moment of centering the shot on the television differs from the previous because it cuts to the following close-up: Unlike before, where the shot following the television pulled back, indicating a lack of total engagement with the image on the screen, here Glatter shows viewers that Sally is finally connecting with someone, albeit someone on a television screen. Her brother and their sitter passed time passively watching a cartoon, but for reasons the show has made plain, Sally is in desperate need of someone who can restore a sense (however imagined) of security to her world. Glatter provides her...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/08/mad-men-enforced-intimacy-in-the-chrysanthemum-and-the-sword.html"><span><strong>Mad Men: &quot;Enforced intimacy&quot; in &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword&quot; </strong> Thirty-six minutes into &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword,&quot; a surprisingly intimate conversation between Don and Dr. Faye Miller takes an uncertain turn when the subject of analysis comes up: &quot;Why does everybody need to talk about everything?&quot; &quot;I don't know, but they do.&quot; Which reminded me of this exchange from Waiting for Godot: &quot;What do they say?&quot; &quot;They talk about their lives.&quot; &quot;To have lived is not enough for them.&quot; &quot;They have to talk about it.&quot; I've elided who said what in both cases because it doesn't matter: these are people who are talking about other people talking about their lives. Their hypocrisy is a function of the scene itself. Or is it? Discussing a life, as Draper and Miller do, with relative strangers in a structured work environment doesn't count as &quot;talk[ing] about everything,&quot; whereas going to a therapist, who is a relative stranger, and discussing a life with him or her in a structured therapeutic environment does. The weight of the phrase, then, either falls on &quot;talk&quot; or &quot;everything,&quot; because the two of them are either not &quot;talk[ing]&quot; or they are, but not &quot;about everything.&quot; Except they are, manifestly, doing both: they are in a kitchen-type-area discussing his divorce and his child learning how to masturbate and entering therapy. Few items could be more &quot;about everything&quot; than those, and as if to press the point that they are &quot;talk[ing]&quot; about something significant, the camera pulls in tight for the final reverse shots: What began as a semi-professional conversation filmed in a medium shot has become, as if by the power of the social lubricant provided by the sake they share, a medium close up. The shot becomes more intimate as their conversation does; that is, they insist they are not &quot;talk[ing] about everything,&quot; but the camera suggests otherwise. I mentioned the Beckett above because Draper and Miller embrace the complaint in the first, second and fourth lines while denying the validity of the third: to have lived is, apparently, not enough for them either. To &quot;talk&quot; is the only way for them to establish the intimacy the camera—if not the entire scene—imputes to them. Consider how it opens: Draper walks in with a bottle of sake, but moves so silently that he startles Miller, who despite possessing a doctorate and working in an office, is washing dishes in stockinged feet. The scene begins as a recapitulation of one the show has presented innumerable times: Draper walks into a kitchen to find a blonde behaving in a wifely fashion and pours himself a drink while offering her some small talk. For example, this scene from the second episode, &quot;Ladies Man,&quot; even follows the same the conversational pattern and shot sequencing as the one above: As the small talk turns to more important matters, the camera moves from a medium to a medium close-up. The difference, of course, is that the blonde in &quot;Ladies Man&quot; is Betty Draper, not a professional colleague. Such an intimacy between a man and a...</span></a></div>
