				<p>As <a href="http://adswithoutproducts.typepad.com/">CR</a> <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/did_you_miss_me.html#comment-17541128">noted</a>,
my intellectual biography revolved around the professors I worked with
more than the ideas they helped me think through.*&nbsp; I could chalk that
up to the empahsis of that particular post, but there's something to
the notion that we adapt to our intellectual environs, and that the
most imposing predators therein are the professors we work with.&nbsp; Let
me weave a few conversations together here: </p>

<ul><li>CR: &quot;I have found that the closer that I keep to the issues
that are
actually important to me, what keeps me up at night thinking and
reading and writing, the happier I am and, so far, the better I do. 
The trick, as is always the trick in intellectual production, is
adapting what is most authentically mine to what the market demands.&quot;</li>

<li><a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/caleb_crain_on_academic_criticism_only_not_really/#9260">Laura</a>: &quot;But my point is that you’re wrong to claim that love must
end before 'pointed interest' (which I take to be the most you think a
professional critic ought to own up to) can begin.&nbsp; You’ve every right
to say there’s no place for love in your personal experience of writing
about literature, and perhaps even within the culture of your
institution, but there are no grounds for asserting that it’s also how
things must work for everybody else.&nbsp; Reasoned, communicable academic scholarship and criticism is perfectly
compatible with love, warmth, pleasure, curiosity, respect and
enjoyment.&nbsp; I would even go so far as to say the very best criticism
must harbour some sympathy for the object of its attention.&nbsp; It’s a
negative capability thing.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/caleb_crain_on_academic_criticism_only_not_really/#9226">Marco Roth</a>: &quot;It seems to me that an interesting debate could be had about the idea
of love implied in the essay. Can’t we go from love of a single author
to love of styles that remind us of our first love? Can the circle of
our affections widen without betraying us to pseudo-science? But surely
the purpose of a profession ought to have some relationship to the
reasons people have for entering it. And—thinking psychologically
rather than professionally—what does actually happen in English
departments?&quot;</li></ul>

<p>Now thrust this all into the intellectual environment of an English
department during graduate study and witness love's ideal evolution: </p>

<ol><li>You come to graduate school with love.</li>

<li>You're forced to adapt that love to professional ends, preferably
without soiling or despoiling it, in order to survive graduate school.</li>

<li>You take your professionalized love to the MLA and hope that it
enhances your performance and increases the odds that you'll land a job
you can stomach.</li>

<li>You land such a job and allow that love to guide your intellectual development for the rest of your days.</li></ol>

<p>Somewhere beneath that professional veneer your first love continues
to inform the work.&nbsp; The formal properties of the academic article
deaden interest in their content.&nbsp; Love enlivens the tired form.&nbsp; It
inflates the flattened prose and communicates to the reader its
contagion.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393050572/diesekoschmar-20">Case in point</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>Now </em>I'm gonna read Shakespeare.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Greenblatt sneezed as
I walked by and now I've caught it.&nbsp; I've got love.&nbsp; The more I think
about this the more convinced I am that CR, Laura and Marco nail these
matters of the literary heart.&nbsp; Because without passion it would be
difficult to muster the investment necessary to acquire viral
erudition.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But note the implications of this line of thought.&nbsp; The love must be of literature.&nbsp; I'm not sure I have <em>that</em>
the way many of my colleagues and interlocutors do.&nbsp; Not that I'm not
partial to a well-turned phrase.&nbsp; (I am.)&nbsp; Only my investment isn't
literary so much as polemical: I love a well-turned <em>argument </em>more
furiously.&nbsp; What my intellectual history reveals to me is an
infatuation with ideas and mode of their articulation, of which &quot;the
literary&quot; is but one.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The ideas I came to graduate school chasing were primarily
theoretical, even when they were guised in literary forms.&nbsp; Another way
to say this may be that I'm not seeking happiness in my professional
life so much as amenable modes of thought.&nbsp; I could call them
&quot;soporific&quot; in that they ward off the insomnia which accompanies the
fear that <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/name_that_fear.html">I'm making it all up</a>.**&nbsp; (Which reminds me that I haven't fully appreciated <a href="http://www.roughtheory.org/">N. Pepperell</a>'s <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/theory_vs_conti.html#comment-17497073">contribution</a> to my intellectual biography.&nbsp; Such is the incoherence that accompanies having too much on one's plate.)&nbsp; </p>

<p>So I've stumbled this argument into a corner.&nbsp; Now I throw my teddy
in it.&nbsp; (And Bob's my uncle!)&nbsp; I can't argue against what logic and
evidence compel me to believe. </p>

<p> But I'm wrong.&nbsp; Prove me so.&nbsp; (What else are you good for?***)<br /> </p>

<p>* Or, as Adam <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/ano/#9361">would have it</a>:
&quot;the professors with whom I worked more than the ideas through which
they helped me think.&quot;&nbsp; Silly Englishman trying to wind me up with
elitist codswallop.&nbsp; I'll show him with.&nbsp; He'll learn the meaning of. </p>

<p>** &quot;. . . up I'm making it all.&quot;</p>

<p>*** &quot;For what else are you good?&quot;</p>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/did_you_miss_me.html"><span><strong>Did You Miss Me?</strong> You certainly missed new content—site stats don't lie, they merely differ markedly as to the number of you who stop by and the frequency with which you do so—and after five days of flying knees-tight in airplanes; driving spine-crunched in cars; sitting through commencement speeches dull enough to melt your unmentionables; and spending one evening among old friends—one of whom reads this blog but bails out on you at 1 AM (ONE AM!) pleading exhaustion—after five days of that you're just going to have to settle for missing it some more. As of now I'm only able to produce sentences of Faulknerian length and Fourth Gradian clarity. But I have quite a bit on the burner for this week, including: A substantial review of Stephen Greenblatt's Will in the World. Advance notice of a project in which I'll devote a post per week to a prominent thespian whose works I've expressed strong dislike for in the past but which, for reasons unbeknownst to me, I've acquired a sudden desire to read seriously. Answering all the email which has graced my inbox unanswered for the past three weeks or so, as well as an explanation as to why I sometimes find it difficult to answer the five or emails I daily receive from you wonderful strangers when I also have 297 student emails in my inbox. Responding to the comments left whilst I was without reliable internet connection. (There are some great ones which need responses from some better version of me than I can currently muster.) Writing a response to Laura's comment (and Marco's too) about loving the one you're with you teach, which strikes me far more forcefully now than it did last week (and which, yes, has something to do with both #1 and #2). (As does the post I plan to write in response to CR's comment about the relationship of teachers to careers vis-a-vis last week's &quot;revelatory&quot; post about my intellectual heritage. (I have posts responding to pretty much every comment in that thread. I'm currently unsure which will be comments and which will stand alone as posts. I reserve the right to change my mind without being held accountable for doing so.) Recounting the two very interesting conversations I had on the trip to Houston and on the trip back. The first has to do with Sean's current celebrity; the second, with my future celebrity. And, finally, responding to the flurry of debate about a certain novel by a certain expat Russian novelist which lately has been getting reduced to, well, openly advocating pedophilia. But doesn't. That needs to be said and hasn't been yet. I will bravely swim counter-current and demand people stop taking literature for propaganda despite frequently treating it as such. (Because that's how I roll . . . hypocritical.) And that's just the beginning. A week without blogging will bring harvest to this barren blog. (Or will if I don't drown in work come tomorrow.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/lovely_viral_er.html"><span><strong>Lovely Viral Erudition, Part II: The Harrowing</strong> &quot;How much longer should I leave this in the broiler?&quot; &quot;At least another 10 minutes.&quot; Sometimes the best a blog can muster ain't all that much. The day after being called one of the better academic bloggers around I completely punt a post about academia. I either overthought what should've been a breezy blog or underthought what should've been a substantial article. Or both. So here are the contradictory points I wanted but failed to address yesterday: Some people (Greenblatt) teach the works they love (Shakespeare) better than those they don't. Other people (me) teach the works they love (Didion) worse than those they don't. (Critical eyes being more easily turned toward works we don't altogether like.) Some people (CR) have a love which drives their intellectual production. Other people (me) have an interest which drives their intellectual production. Thus: Some people (me) should be more drawn to Theory than other people (CR). Other people (CR, Laura, Marco) should be more drawn to the &quot;amorous historicism&quot; Caleb Crain discussed in his n+1 essay. (Yet the opposite seems true.) Adam is a Grammar Nazi. The problem? All of these statements (sans #4) are oversimplifications. The other problem? All of these issues (sans #4) are related in some fundamental fashion. The other other problem? I'm tackling these issues (sans #4) as &quot;successfully&quot; as I do an argument with eighteen planks and countless unstated premises. That is: Poorly. Yet the desire to encompass it all immediately overwhelms. I don't know where to start but I desperately want to finish. Not at all unlike writing a dissertation chapter. (Note to all paying attention: still not finished.) This all ties into the thread without end John's hosting. Were I not oddly reluctant to tackle any of these issues individually I could probably sort through it in a way that would make them meaningful to others. (Is this the sort of blog noodling people are always complaining about?)</span></a></div>
