The Following People Now Officially Exist: John Holbo, Belle Waring, Amardeep Singh, Sean McCann, Matt Greenfield, Mark Bauerlein, Scott McLemee, Jennifer Howard, Scott Jaschik, Michael Bérubé, Clancy Ratliff, Ken Warren, The Anonymous Woman and That Kevin Spacey Guy. Things You Would/Would Not Expect About Some of These People: Holbo speaks softly and deliberately. Bérubé's mouth can barely keep pace with his mind. Given that they both have a reputation for squeezing insanely long posts into &quot;free time&quot; which doesn't exist, I though Holbo would've sounded like more Bérubé. Granted, I haven't seen either type. For all I know Bérubé may hunt-and-peck while John burns through three keyboards a year. Clancy Ratliff has a slight Southern accent. It only cropped up once or twice during her panel but I know I heard one. When I did I thought to myself &quot;She doesn't write like someone with a Southern accent.&quot; Then I wondered if I did. Then I resumed paying attention to her presentation. (Her panel may be the first one I blog about later. It dovetailed beautifully with the conversations John and I have had with each other, the other Valve contributors and complete strangers.) Irrational Assumptions Proved Untrue: Amardeep has &quot;bug eyes.&quot; Why did I think that? Because an Amardeep I went to middle school with had some serious thyroid condition which caused his eyes to swell out of their sockets. He was &quot;encouraged&quot; to wear sunglasses in the classroom. I am happy to report that our Amardeep does not have &quot;bug eyes.&quot; His thyroid seems to be in perfect working order. Scott McLemee is very tall. Because he writes like a tall person. But he is of average height. (John told me he had the opposite experience with Henry Farrell. He assumed Henry would be of average height when in truth he is a giant.) Matt Greenfield is a person of average height. He is very tall. Jennifer Howard is a person of average height. She too is very tall. I also thought she would be the stereotypically fresh-faced beat reporter. This assumption deserves a cateory of its own because that's exactly what she looks like.

<p>In the meantime I'll sketch my silly assumptions about the people I've met.</p>

<p><strong>The Following People Now Officially Exist:</strong></p><blockquote><p>John Holbo, Belle Waring, Amardeep Singh, Sean McCann, Matt Greenfield, Mark Bauerlein, Scott McLemee, Jennifer Howard, Scott Jaschik, Michael Bérubé, Clancy Ratliff, Ken Warren, <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/12/mla_who_is_anyb.html">The Anonymous Woman</a> and <a href="http://culturecat.net/node/1002">That Kevin Spacey Guy</a>.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Things You Would/Would Not Expect About Some of These People:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Holbo speaks softly and deliberately.&nbsp; Bérubé's mouth can barely keep pace with his mind.&nbsp; Given that they both have a reputation for squeezing insanely long posts into &quot;free time&quot; which doesn't exist, I though Holbo would've sounded like more Bérubé.&nbsp; Granted, I haven't seen either type.&nbsp; For all I know Bérubé may hunt-and-peck while John burns through three keyboards a year.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Clancy Ratliff has a slight Southern accent.&nbsp; It only cropped up once or twice during her panel but I know I heard one.&nbsp; When I did I thought to myself &quot;She doesn't <em>write </em>like someone with a Southern accent.&quot;&nbsp; Then I wondered if I did.&nbsp; Then I resumed paying attention to her presentation.&nbsp; (Her panel may be the first one I blog about later.&nbsp; It dovetailed beautifully with the conversations John and I have had with each other, the other Valve contributors and complete strangers.)</p></blockquote><p><strong>Irrational Assumptions Proved Untrue:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Amardeep has &quot;bug eyes.&quot;&nbsp; Why did I think that?&nbsp; Because an Amardeep I went to middle school with had some serious thyroid condition which caused his eyes to swell out of their sockets.&nbsp; He was &quot;encouraged&quot; to wear sunglasses in the classroom.&nbsp; I am happy to report that our Amardeep does not have &quot;bug eyes.&quot;&nbsp; His thyroid seems to be in perfect working order.</p>

<p>Scott McLemee is very tall.&nbsp; Because he writes like a tall person.&nbsp; But he is of average height.&nbsp; (John told me he had the opposite experience with <a href="http://www.henryfarrell.net/">Henry Farrell</a>.&nbsp; He assumed Henry would be of average height when in truth he is a giant.)&nbsp; </p>

<p>Matt Greenfield is a person of average height.&nbsp; He is very tall.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Jennifer Howard is a person of average height.&nbsp; She too is very tall.&nbsp; I also thought she would be the stereotypically fresh-faced beat reporter.&nbsp; This assumption deserves a cateory of its own because that's exactly what she looks like.&nbsp; She <em>claims </em>to be much older and a mother of two but I don't buy it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Ken Warren is old.&nbsp; This assumption also deserves a category of its own because Warren <em>claims</em> to be as old as I thought he would be.&nbsp; According to him, two of his children have already graduated from college.&nbsp; My first thought was that he must've adopted two high school seniors when he was 24.&nbsp; <em>I</em> look older than him (esp. right now).&nbsp; <br /> </p></blockquote><p>You see where this is headed: I think tall people write one way and short people another.&nbsp; Why on earth would I think that?&nbsp; What verbal cues do I pick up (or, given the accuracy of my estimations, most likely invent) which would indicate how short or tall a blogger is?&nbsp; (In my defense I did correctly suss the height of Miriam B.&nbsp; But she calls her blog &quot;The Little Professor&quot; so that might be cheating.)&nbsp; I don't remember ever discussing things which would give me a fair estimate of their height.&nbsp; So what gives? </p>

When things got busy, I would often speak to clients on the phone, but send someone else on site to follow up.  It would occasionally come up in casual conversation that I am very short (this was a source of endless amusement to some of my taller staff members...) and, periodically, a client - a client who had never *seen* me in person, mind you - would actually <i>argue</i> with my staff that they must be speaking of someone else, because the client was convinced that I am quite tall.  Apparently, I &quot;sound tall&quot; on the phone...  ;-P</p>

<p>I think we all unavoidably visualise the people we&#39;re reading - and those visualisations are inevitably going to be inaccurate.  Just now, I had a bit of a start when you mentioned wondering whether you &quot;write&quot; with a southern accent, because this jarred with my sense of how your written voice &quot;sounds&quot; - this in spite of the fact that I know you&#39;ve lived in Houston, and in spite of the fact that I used to live there myself, so I know full well what the local accent would be...</p></span>

So don&#39;t write well if you don&#39;t wish to be oggled by me. That kind of reflexive association is bound to be common, what with so many people seeming to be interested in sex. Actually I suppose the tall short thing could be common too, or at least have a few common explanations. Writing that strikes you as forceful you&#39;re liable to imagine as authored by somebody who fits your idea of physical formidability. Writing that strikes you as charming...etc. But I think our paradigms and paragons of this or that personal quality must depend on who taught us algebra in 8th grade and who bullied us on the school yard, etc. </p></span>

However, I didn&#39;t expect him to speak like the academic version of Quentin Tarantino in casual conversation, too, and in multiple subordinate clauses, to boot.  And on top of that his voice was softer in volume than I expected (partly due to his sore throat at the time).

<p>As I&#39;ll write in more detail either below or later, I&#39;m not sure I associate fine prose with pretty faces . . . in large part because I know what so many authors look like.  Joyce?  Whitman?  Woolf?  Eliot (T.S. or George)?  All of them capable of real eloquence but none of them a looker by any stretch of the imagination.  (That said, I really wish I&#39;d taken pictures while I was here.  I meant to, but there&#39;s something tacky about turning everything into a photo op.)</p>

<p>N.  Pepperell,</p>

<p>Have no fear: my parents live in Houston but I never have.  I lived in Louisiana, which may be worse.  That said, because I did eight years of speech therapy, I have one of those accents no one can place.  They hear a &quot;y&#39;all&quot; every once in a while, but that is mroe a class than regional marker at this point; they hear faint traces of Northern Jersey (where I lived until I was nine) and Southern Louisiana (where I lived until I was 21), but mostly I have that unidentifiable accent of television journalists. (I think it&#39;s called &quot;The Iowa,&quot; but Google returns zip to back me up.)  The other thing I could do is ask everyone who just met me to try to remember what I sound like and whether they identified it with a particular region.  I doubt they would have, but I&#39;m not them.</p>

<p>MT,</p>

<p><i>That kind of reflexive association is bound to be common, what with so many people seeming to be interested in sex.</i></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t realize my readers wanted to sleep with me.  Or wait, do you not think me a fine writer?</p>

<p><i>Writing that strikes you as forceful you&#39;re liable to imagine as authored by somebody who fits your idea of physical formidability.</i></p>

<p>Not that I&#39;m thinking about this right now, but Jack London believed the opposite (as did Hemingway, I believe): i.e. that only people who possessed physical formidability had the discipline to be good writers.  But that&#39;s hypermasculine nonsense . . . and not at the heart of why I consider some bloggers tall and others short.  </p>

<p>Another strange thought occurs to me: when you read a blog do you picture the blogger as being seated in front of his/her computer typing?  I do, which may account for why all the tall people surprised me . . . but doesn&#39;t account for why I thought McLemee tall.  I need to think about this more, because I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s 1) wholly idiosyncratic or 2) tied to the scene of composition.  It could certainly be the second one, because now that I think about it I distinctly remember McLemee saying that he wrote by hand then typed his essays, which means in my head I&#39;d be imagining him hunched over a desk <i>like Abe Lincoln in an elementary school desk</i>, whereas if you&#39;re typing you&#39;re as erect as you would otherwise be, and thus, in the imaged scene of composition, you wouldn&#39;t seem distorted.  Maybe.  </p>

<p>Dr. Virago,</p>

<p><i>My hearing is a little damaged so I wonder, did *you* have a hard time keeping up with him?</i></p>

<p>If properly motivated, I can focus on catching every audible cue to 1) give myself a splitting headache and 2) understand pretty much everything in context.  I had a more difficult time when we stood outside the bar, but once we went in and stole ourselves a back table, I could understand him fine with a little effort.  I can&#39;t do that for prolonged periods of time without veering into migraine infested waters, but for a little over an hour I can do it without too deleterious an effect.  Plus, I went to get a drink with a friend afterward, so booze effectively killed the headache.</p></span>

<p>My own opinion is that we should renorm our standards on a thrifty, environmentally-aware, global, non-Eurocentric, non-Dutch standard, and declare 5&#39;7&quot; to be the top end of normal height. </p></span>

<p>I never claimed to be original.  I only claim to be the best.  </p>

<p>Clancy,</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t expect Mark to be so tall, such a forceful speaker and, for lack of a better adjective, so <i>dashing</i>.  (I also didn&#39;t expect I&#39;d forget to include that in the original post.  It says it right there in my notebook ... )</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t expect Jonathan to have a slight Southern accent either.  By the way, if I have any trace of any accent, it&#39;s from Louisiana, so I&#39;m not condemning people with one or anthing, only registering surprise.   I suppose, given most of the people I knew growing up, my expectations for that accent are, well, <i>given most of the people I knew growing up</i> ... but then again, most of the people everyone knows growing up aren&#39;t that ...</p></span>

Those who live quiet lives should not travel across the country and pretend they're Hunter S. Thompson and not expect dire fucking consequences. Around 3 a.m. I awoke shaking with a bone-chill four layers of sweaters and a heater could not kill. I took some Tylenol and stopped shaking . . . but I suspect my body had some threshold which I unwittingly crossed yesterday. I don't think I'm actually ill so much as toast. So unless the fifteen gallons of water I've imbibed have magical restorative powers, I will only venture to Brian Thill's panel today. (Otherwise I would have to admit I wasted valuable suitcase space on a giant foam finger.) UPDATE: A couple more hours of sleep and I'm young and alive again! Best. Flu-like. Symptoms. Ever.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/12/mla_nary_a_whim.html"><span><strong>MLA: Nary a Whimper &amp; What the Future Holds</strong> The MLA does not end. It is escaped. By the time I was composed enough to wander downstairs the lines at the registration desk occupied a goodly portion of the gigantic lobby. People dashed about in a luggage-hampered half-clip to make the this- or that-thirty shuttle to Reagan or Dulles. Sure there were still panels to attend, but who wants to stay another day in this environment? Certainly not the man who nearly knocked me down as he darted to a gap in the shuttle line without even bothering to apologize. Three days at the MLA had turned him into a beast. Who knows what a fourth would have wrought. Despite a strong desire to process my experience here . . . to recount conversations in mind-numbing detail, reconstruct the dynamics of the best and worst panels, discuss the overwhelming depth and vapidity of this event, its importance and insignificance . . . despite that desire I think I'll refrain from making those conversations a matter of public record. I will provide accounts of panels and Q &amp; A sessions, but not conversations had in or between bars, on the way to or from readings, or before or after panels. Interesting though they are, the expectations were that the conversations were private, not expected to be up to the standard of public performance. Not that this is true. The most illuminating conversations I had were with one-on-one with scholars in an informal setting. But I since they didn't think they were on the record, they didn't tailor their statements for public consumption. I take that back: some did. Walter Benn Michaels asked whether his answer to a question asked in the bar would end up on the Valve was answered, promptly, with a &quot;Would you be offended if it did?&quot; He answered in the negative, but I cannot in good faith generalize the feelings of an entire profession from a snippet of a conversation which may have lasted all of five seconds. That said, the coming weeks will see some material of interest both here and on the Valve, by which I mean &quot;exclusively on the Valve.&quot; We have a hoard of writers--some of them bloggers, others intrigued enough to want to take the plunge--who want to become contributors to the Valve. We've already officially invited one. The next few months should be an exciting time both here and on the Valve. Our plan to have the entire editorial staff of The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism may yet come to fruition.</span></a></div>
