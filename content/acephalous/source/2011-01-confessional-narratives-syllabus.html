        <meta name="description" content="By request, here's the meat of my &quot;Confessional Narratives&quot; syllabus. The standard caveat applies. I'll post the &quot;Slow Horror&quot; syllabus after I think of a better name for the course tomorrow and address the comments in the Fight Club post when I throw together my lesson plan for Thursday's class. The confessional narrative is not, strictly speaking, a medium (film, books, television, etc.) or a genre (romantic comedies, action movies, horror films, etc.). It is a mode; that is, it is less a kind of story and more a way of telling a story. In this class, we will examine works in the confessional mode in an attempt to define what features and characteristics belong to it. At the beginning of the quarter—which would be now—you will have to take my word that the works we will study are in the confessional mode; by the end of the quarter, I fully expect, and will in fact be disappointed if you don't challenge the assumptions on which my selections were based. The most salient element that the works you will encounter in this class share is that they are, in their own way, autobiographical; however, as autobiography is a genre, not a mode, it is possible for works that are not autobiographical to be written in the confessional mode. (We will be reading one such work, Daniel Clowes' Ghost World, at the end of the quarter.) The reason for studying this mode should be obvious: American culture, at this particular historical moment, is obsessively confessional. Be it Facebook and its ethos of “pics or it didn't happen” or a Tiger Woods press conference-cum-therapy session or films and television series “based on a true story,” Americans crave the kind of information that was once only shared in close quarters. In order to discover why that is, we must first understand how these narratives work; that is, we must figure out how they move us before we can discover why they do. To that end, we will be learning about rhetoric, a word so important to this class it must be bold. Rhetoric entails more than ethos, pathos and logos—the three elements which you likely learned in high school—it refers to all the techniques that an author or auteur uses to make his or her message appeal to a particular audience. In order to understand why a graphic novel appeals to an audience, we must first understand the rhetorical devices particular to it: panel transitions, word-picture relations, the visual vocabulary of film, etc. Similarly, in order to understand why a film appeals an audience, we must first understand the rhetorical devices particular to it: focal length, angle of framing, lighting, etc. We will devote the first few weeks of this quarter learning the terminology associated with both the comic and filmic mediums, then apply that knowledge to other works for the remainder of it.

<p>Any narrative in which a primary intent is to create a version of &quot;self&quot; by telling &quot;your&quot; story.  I&#39;m trying to keep the definition as expansive as I can at the beginning of the quarter, because I don&#39;t want them to think there&#39;s a system that&#39;ll allow them to &quot;solve&quot; these books.  <em>E.g.</em> I could throw Foucault at them, but then they&#39;ll just throw a bunch of Foucauldian readings right back at me.</p>

<p><em>Could you elaborate on ethos, pathos and logos as elements of rhetoric?</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s directly from Aristotle&#39;s <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.1.i.html" rel="nofollow"><em>On Rhetoric</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word there are three kinds. [...] Persuasion is achieved by the speaker&#39;s personal character [ethos] when the speech is so spoken as to make us think him credible. [...] Secondly, persuasion may come through the hearers, when the speech stirs their emotions [pathos]. [...] Thirdly, persuasion is effected through the speech itself [logos] when we have proved a truth or an apparent truth by means of the persuasive arguments suitable to the case in question.</blockquote>

<p><em>I know you&#39;re trying for a playful and self-aware voice, but to me you&#39;re coming off snotty</em></p>

<p>It may sound snotty to you, but I&#39;m mainly aiming for &quot;personable.&quot;  As for mentioning the obviousness of something obvious, you know what I&#39;m up to there: it&#39;s obvious to me, and it&#39;ll be obvious to them the second I mention it ... but they&#39;ve never thought about it in those terms before.  It&#39;s a way of establishing the importance and relevance of the material on the fly.</p></span>

<p>Right, it&#39;s a question of cultural backgrounds/predelictions/taste as well as ear. This assertion of a presumed relationship to knowledge (ie, &quot;should be obvious&quot;), however, sounds to me condescending rather than authoritative.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/fight-club.html"><span><strong>I will make you love me.</strong> The first fifteen minutes of Fight Club strongly suggest to its audience that they're about to watch a much better film than the one they're actually watching—the critique of material culture has yet to embrace to the juvenile punk resistence of the novel and the depiction of insomnia is still pointed enough to be trenchant—so when I decided to teach it in my &quot;Confessional Narratives&quot; course, focusing almost entirely on the opening sequences was essentially a given. The problem is that David Fincher's direction is as busy as it is effective, if only because representing a state of fevered distraction tends to look a bit frenetic. (By my count, there are 659 cuts in the portion of the film I'm going to focus on, which means that any close reading of it will either be abridged or incomplete, depending on how trustworthy you think me.) I'll attempt to discuss the pace of the editing shortly, but for now I want to discuss why we even care. There are two lines of thought being represented in the first fifteen minutes of the film: the first is that the audience is being introduced to an unlikeable sociopath; the second is that the selfsame audience is being convinced to like him. How does that work? Via relentless frontality: when the audience stares into the void behind Edward Norton's eyes long enough, the void stares back until it becomes a welcoming presence. To wit: Note that the fourth wall is never actually being broken here: in the first image Norton is staring into space; the second, at his boss; the third, at a list of group meetings; and the fourth, into space again. I point this out because frontality conventionally works to distance the audience from the characters by pulling the characters out of the diegetic world of the film and into that of the audience. Here, however, Fincher is doing the exact opposite: he's enforcing an intimacy between the audience and a character it might not otherwise sympathize with (and rightly so). The audience identifies with Norton because it has stared into the void of his eyes and recognizes in them something inelegant and desperately wanting; and it does so because Fincher has provided them with no other choice. The film simply doesn't work if the sympathetic identification isn't immediately established. Hence, the frontality.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/slow-horror-syllabus.html"><span><strong>&quot;Slow Horror&quot; Syllabus</strong> Same deal as the other and same rules apply. I'm still not happy with the title (or finished adding texts to teach), but there you go. For most of its existence as a genre, horror has been a matter of pace; however, for the past decade writers and directors have worked under the assumption that it is about gore (Saw MCMXVII: The Revenge of the Man with His Eyes Where His Kidneys Once Were) or quick pointless deaths (28 Hundred Days Later: Cardiff Hosts the Action Zombie Olympics). Critics surmised the reason for the popularity of the torture porn like Saw and The Human Centipede was the law of diminishing returns: once an audience has seen one man reduced to four stumps, it requires something even more debasing to satisfy its vicarious sociopathy. Their reason for the popularity of films like 28 Days Later is more mundane: the average American attention span rivals that of a spastic child, so a director who lets terror creep slowly risks having his or her audience forget why they were supposed to be scared. Recent developments in the genre, however, indicate that these critics may have been a bit cynical. The past two years have witnessed a renaissance in the classic horror mode which we'll be calling “slow horror.” Texts: Blow Up (the classic “slow” film) Buffy the Vampire Slayer (“Hush” and how no dialogue intensifies the horror) The Walking Dead (graphic novel and television series) Doctor Who (“The Time of Angels”) 30 Days of Night (graphic novel and film)</span></a></div>
