We live in the age of Real Simple Syndication, which means even if you go dormant, people will know when you start blogging again. This is the Timothy Burke model: he disappears for a few weeks, comes back with a couple of great posts, then disappears again. You do not have to post five times a day. You can follow the Acephalous model and post once a day. Posting once a day has pleasant side effects: foremost among them, a backlog of potential posts (which I keep in a drafts folder and mine fairly frequently). Think of it like this: you gain an audience by making a splash. Throwing a thousand individual pebbles makes for a thousand tiny splashes. No one will notice. Hire a wrecking crew and chunk a few boulders in there and everyone will notice. So, write a few great posts, have them linked to by the right people, and you'll find yourself with an audience. Sinthome's a good example of this (although lately he's chucking individual boulders in four times daily). If you write something you know another blogger will find interesting, by all means, send an email. If you merely think they will, however, hold off.

Another quarter are pseudo-spam sent by people who email all the Marauding Marsupials with links to their poorly-scribed political screeds or the latest update on their vanity project of dubious value. But I take the time to read the rest and comment when I have something to say. (That said, I love those sorts of emails, so feel free to send me more.) I don't link to nearly enough of them—or in a timely manner—but that's the fault of the aforementioned backlog.

My overriding rule for postings - all of them - is I have to have ~some~ passion for the subject at hand.  I have to want to put myself out there.  A corollary to that rule, since mine is an &quot;academic blog&quot; (mostly) is this: stay professional. - TL</p></span>

On Eileen Joy's advice, I looked up Eduardo Cadava's &quot;Words of Light: Theses on the Photography of History&quot; [JSTOR]. Glad I did—the article's quite good—but the non-specificity of this sentence irks me: [Benjamin's] insistence on the necessity of addressing these questions and relations today—then in the 1930s as well as now, under the light or darkness of a scarcely less disastrous historical moment—is above all, a call to responsibility, a call that requires a passionate and determined effort of reflection. The footnote explains that Cadava speaks of &quot;the tragedy of what we now refer to as the 'War in the Gulf.'&quot; Fair enough. Mention the &quot;War in the Gulf&quot; and everyone will know exactly what you're talking about. UPDATE! Just in case it ain't absolutely plain, I really really liked Cadava's essay; found it charmingly Benjaminian, which as critical modes go, I absolutely love. There was just this one moment that reminded me of annoying moments in other essays. Note how I don't slam Cadava for what he accounts for in his footnotes...because he accounts for it in his footnotes. So please, no more hate mail. (Or at the very least, reserve it for when I actually lash out at somebody unjustly.)</span></a></div>

(Seven-word Titles? As If. Crap.)</strong> They wrote six words; no stories. Hemingway too, except with great success: &quot;For sale: baby shoes, never worn.&quot; Six words: a small story condensed. Evocative miniatures of tragedies. (To scale.) The hunter squeezes. His son falls. She jumped; he died there too. Cat toy on floor. She cries. Drunk driver, wrong lane: Mother screams. &quot;Shoes? His feet are in Iraq.&quot; Spooning: &quot;We should see other people.&quot; Dinner? Delicious. Now I feel vile. Feverish, he tosses; sweating, hours pass. Sheets soaked, throat parched: he stares. &quot;I'm dead.&quot; (Will write more soon.)</span></a></div>
