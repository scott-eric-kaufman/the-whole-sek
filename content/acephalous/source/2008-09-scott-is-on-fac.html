<p>Should I send you some fake gifts or zombies or ugly little green flower people or whatever it is they waste time with on facebook?</p>

<p>I&#39;m just in it for the scrabble and for watching the various former members of my grad program fall in and out of relationships with each other. And now that scrabulous is dead, no body plays with me any more. How sad.</p></span>

I refuse the zombies/gifts/&amp;c and hate scrabble and am not looking for love. Short defense: I can&#39;t think of any better system for staying in touch with conference friends. Email, sure, but then there&#39;s the obligation that an email imposes; a status update does no such thing, nor does posting links, nor does, say, a general bleg for bib. Each keeps my peeps appraised of my interests and worries, as I can be appraised of theirs. If I weren&#39;t an academic in NYC, if I were (like some of my conference now facebook and perhaps even real friends) in Ypsilanti, for example, or Ithaca, or Washington DC, or some other tiny, isolated place, I&#39;d be <i>desperate</i> to keep in contact.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-132607229-content"><p>I agree with Karl.  Facebook allows for a lot more continuity in my relationships with people.  I&#39;m in a strange land (Dallas, TX) and every single one of my friends lives somewhere far away.  Some of them I&#39;m good at keeping in contact with, but I know a lot of people that I like but never have a good reason to e-mail or call.  Previously those people would simply have dropped out of my life, and I&#39;d encounter them years later and have to catch up.  Now I know when they move to Mexico for a few months, or sometimes even when they have kids (any invention that allows parents to upload photos of their infants and trust other people to look at them by their own volition, instead of forcibly showing them to people, is excellent in my book.)</p></span>
