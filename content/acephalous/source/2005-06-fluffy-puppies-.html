        <meta name="description" content="Where have I gone? Nowhere. But the intellectual substance of what I've been reading lately hasn't warranted much writing. At least, popular perception of what I've been reading hasn't. For example, I finished Grant Morrison's excellent comic series WE3. It follows the adventures of the three cuddly animals--cover pictured on the left--as they escape from the super-secret containment government facility and make their way home. Now, I think the book quite good in the same way that I thought Buffy the Vampire Slayer quite good: it plays pinballs with entirely distinct generic conventions. Over the course of this short, relatively dialogue-free graphic novel, Morrison creates a compellingly convincing account of the logic behind &quot;war without casualties&quot; initiatives without betraying the cloying narrative conventions of landmarks of Hollywood cinema like Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. (Attentive readers will note the similarities between the cover of the Michael J. Fox and Sally Fields-voiced fare and Frank Quitely's. I don't think that's a coincidence, nor do I think it all that clever.) What's interesting about the book is how, for example, when the animal rights advocate who created the trio responds to their imminent departure from this world--&quot;decommisioned&quot; in the book's lingo, but euphemisms like &quot;puppy heaven&quot; and &quot;put to sleep&quot; also apply--by releasing them into the wild. Her concern, as that of all animal lovers would be, is with the destruction of the animals. She cares not a whit what the implications of releasing these cuddly killing machines into the wild are. The fact that they demolish raw most of what they encounter doesn't bother her. Moral conundrums ensue. What, after all, should we think about the poor owner of Tinker whose &quot;hand-made&quot; sign graces the cover of one of the unbound issues? Surely he or she misses Tinker, and surely Tinker would rather not have become a cat equipped with ground-to-air missiles. Surely? Surely. So, for those who wonder why I haven't been posting with regularity, now you know. Were I to post, I'd be writing about comic books and science fiction...but I wouldn't be writing all that intelligently about either. The most I can say about John Clute's exceptional and exceptionally dense Appleseed is that it defies xeno- and technological compulsions of hard sci-fi in refreshingly confusing ways. I could pull numerous examples from the book, but that'd bore you to tears and cause the ever-increasing knot in the small of my back to tangle more ferociously. So you'll have to settle for a singular example about an apparently multiple headed creature that's doing some that has something to do with maintaing a safe orbit: ...he allowed himself to forgive the teeth and their head (this once!) and let his brainless breakfast head sink its hollow jowls (starvation eat all liars!) into a trough of loyal wrigglies, which it wolfed down. He adjusted the twining of his tails within the cart, settled into command posture over the great lunch bucket, and--white it continued slowly to starve half to death awaiting..." />

<p>You might want to cut Delany some slack. As a reader at the time, I can testify that a mention of Lacan in an early 1976 science fiction paperback would much better be described as generously-donated publicity than as name-dropping. The earliest English translations came in 1977.<br />

What amazes me is how thoroughly I've forgotten everything I ever learned about Derrida and deconstruction. I'm flipping through my copies of Writing and Difference, Glas, The Gift of Death, &amp;c. and staring incomprehensibly at my incomprehensible notes. I'm reading over the essay I wrote for J. Hillis Miller on The Gift of Death--by which I mean I'm dumbly observing the words tumbling over the pages but not understanding them at all--and it dawns on me that I may've conned my way through the first couple of years of graduate school. I sincerely belive that Hillis' comments on this essay are the product of his genius, i.e. utterly unrelated to the reality of the essay he graded. Which is only to say, qua Matt, that the word &quot;deconstruction&quot; ought not only be banned from undergraduate classroom, but graduate seminars too. In other words, what happened to that eager incoming graduate student who, knowing he'd attend Derrida's seminar in the Spring, spent hours reading every book and article the Man had ever written? I remember sitting before the shelves of the Critical Theory Archive with contraband coffee and unbounded enthusiasm, reading with infinite patience primary and secondary materials whose full import I still can't comprehend. I remember neglecting my other classes--including, ironically, the Introduction to Critical Theory course that might've grounded my extra-curricular study--in order to read, say, Derrida's new essay in Critical Inquiry. But it's all gone. All of it. (Cynics among you will think I'm accusing Derrida of writing in a manner that condemns all but his broadest claims to the void. I may very well be. But I don't think it offensive to say that careful, continual study is required to read and remember difficult works.) Perhaps this all falls under the principles codified in The Five Year Rule, according to which Scott declines to speak about books he's read more than five years ago because he can seldom say anything intelligent about them. Countless times have fellow graduate students throppled by a novel they know Scott's read come to him for intelligent conversation only to have Scott stare blankly at them. &quot;Jane Austen? The name rings a bell. A small one. In a church fourteen districts north. Of some place fourteen hundred miles east. Wait! Isn't she the sister in Middlemarch?&quot;</span></a></div>

Cephalous Word of the Every Other Day or So</strong> Frustrated by other &quot;word of the day&quot; services? Tired of receiving daily emails from that most august of all dictionaries, the OED, in which you learn that &quot;place&quot; n. means &quot;Space. Extension in two (or three) directions; room&quot;? Have I got a deal for you! Starting now I'll be posting whatever obscure word threatens my colloquial speech with regular usage on any given day. With definitions, quotations, citations and all the other requisite lexicological dressings. The A. Cephalous Word of the Every Other Day or So for Thursday, June 30, 2005 comes from heraldry: appaumy, adj.

Cephalous), On The Telephone &quot;If she pulls that shit with me again, that's it, she'll wish the worst thing I did to her with my hands is flash dexter appaumy.&quot; 1992 Suburban White Girl (to A. Cephalous), P.E. Class &quot;Oh no, you did na, you DID NA! Beseech the sinister hand appaumy bitch!&quot; 1998 Suburban White Girl, Early Wedded, Early Bedded, Divorce Proceedings &quot;Your Honor, then I told him to supplicate before my hand appaumy if he wanted to save this marriage, and he said 'Whatever Janine! What. Ever. I've been fucking your sister for five years.'&quot; 2005 Suburban White Girl, Divorced (to A. Cephalous' best friend), Tenth High School Reunion &quot;A.
