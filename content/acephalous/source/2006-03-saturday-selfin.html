<p>Cool, and congrats!  If it gets accepted -- and it sounds like it will -- I&#39;ll definitely be there to see it.  Perhaps we can set up a meeting in the darkest corner of the nearest shadowy bar, so that the anonymous academic bloggers can meet up with the non-anonymous ones.  I&#39;ll be the guy in the trenchcoat and sunglasses, casting frequent and furtive glances over my shoulder.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really too bad that the conference doesn&#39;t fall on a Tuesday -- it would have been fun to meet at Philly&#39;s Drinking Liberally location.</p></span>
