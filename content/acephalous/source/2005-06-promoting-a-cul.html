When the obvious is unavoidable, the misunderstandings are likely to be less egregious, less enduring and less heated.&nbsp; A departmental community is a closed system; a blog is an open system, one in which anyone can pop their level, disinterested head and inform all aggreived parties about the present, grossly engorged status of their molehills.&nbsp; (Given the nature of these debates, all possible pun intended.) Why, do you ask, am I personally so invested in this?&nbsp; </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/same_senseless_ramblings_slightly_bigger_stage_or_intellectual_investments/#comments">the-thread-that-refused-to-die</a>,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/same_senseless_ramblings_slightly_bigger_stage_or_intellectual_investments/#1587">replying</a> to Jonathan’s misunderstood estimation of my intellectual abilities--I said “misunderstood,” mind you, not “incorrect&quot;--I remarked </p><blockquote><p>as for you indicating that I’m potentially “cartoonishly arrogant and ignorant,” I mean, c’mon: I have thicker skin, and I know you can do better than that.&nbsp; I think these conversations succeed or fail based on how much benefit of the doubt’s ladled out.&nbsp; I’m all for a liberal ladlin’...even if, at times, doing so requires ignoring what may be perceived as slights (personal or intellectual).</p></blockquote><p>The problems that Mr. Mendelsohn identifies with the listserv format are the result of the ingrained group dynamics of people who’ve come, for largely institutional reasons, to interpret their colleagues’ words in the least flattering and most inflammatory manner possible.&nbsp; There is absolutely no reason to sanction--as <em>The Chronicle</em>, by publishing this op-ed, appears to--similar conclusions about what happens on blogs.&nbsp; We can decide, en masse, in the interest of the general productivity of discussions, to be generous readers of each other’s posts and comments; or we can coast on reflex and reflux and become Mr. Mendelsohn’s caricatures.&nbsp; Over the next few months we’ll be discussing issues as inflammatory as those Mr. Mendelsohn’s constructs discussed--race and union action--and we’ll probably feel as strongly about these issues as Mendelsohn’s caricatures no doubt felt about theirs.&nbsp; The question is, when these issues arise, what do you do?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.homevideos.com/freezeframes1122/speed44-b.jpg">What...do...you...do?</a> </p>

But you? You write and write and write, blithely unaware that every word you put to paper is further evidence of your awesome incompetence. There you sit, a marvel of scholarly productivity, oblivious to the effect the evacuations of your incontinent mind will have upon your audience. You write. Your complex palaver about the problems you’ve invented to identify and solve concerns you alone. You write. You entertain fancies of your imminent importance when you think no one’s around: royalty checks in whole dollars; a permanent place on trendy syllabi; a course-packet apotheosis. You write. I hate you. Still you write. You should see reflected in your words those of Ambrose Beirce: Self-esteem, n. An erroneous appraisement. No doubt your inattention to the matter of your audience will have no effect on the acceptance of your ideas. But what if you did pay attention to your audience. What would you produce then? A readable book, a potential best-seller like Mark McGurl’s The Novel Art or Tom Lutz’s American Nervousness: 1903? Do you think the quality of your prose alters your readers’ experience of it? Whose prose do you emulate? To whom do you turn when you want to steal that turn of phrase? One of those literary types you’re always yammerin’ on about? Another scholar? Because you really need help. You’re a terrible writer.</span></a></div>

To them I hurl hurtful words about how rewarding teaching literary journalism is and how refreshing reading drafts of student articles meant not to impress but entertain is. (The grading grammar hangover, as the syntax of that previous sentence makes abundantly clear, still bedevils literary journalism instructors.) After a quarter spent teaching the middle- to high-brow techniques commonly employed by literary journalists, I'm faced with a situation in which commenting on student papers involves little more than line-editing, pointing to the techniques the students should've already gleaned from articles already read and the occasional finger-wagging when a student's &quot;research&quot; underwhelms. (Before accusations of academic sinecure start flying around, carefully consider the phrase &quot;little more than line-editing.&quot;) This quarter I pushed back the first draft of the required writing component of the course to Week 9, the quarter's penultimate week, with the thought that the more time the students concentrate on reading, the better the final articles will be. Boy. Howdy. These first drafts floored me. While still suffering from many of the problems that all young literary journalists must overcome, these first drafts are far suprior to any first drafts past students have produced. Not only that, some of these first drafts are better than many of the final drafts past students have produced. In the past, I've had first drafts due in Week 7, the thought being that the more revisions the better. But there's a trade-off: because the students already writing in Weeks 5, 6 and 7, they're not paying as much attention to the assigned reading as they otherwise might. (I suspect that, up-swept in the rush to produce their first drafts, they may do very little of the assigned reading.) This quarter, they focused on reading, analyzing and discussing articles until Week 8 and what I've discovered is this: those 4 or 5 extra weeks of dedicated reading make all the difference in the world. These students are impressively intuitive because, technically speaking, they fucking get it. Why then do you suppose that so many undergraduate papers for literature classes are so patently awful? The commonplace complaint of English professors--the students don't read criticism and therefore don't know how to produce it--always rings hollow. The Balkanization of the profession ensures that even a student well-versed in criticism is unlikely to produce what a particular professor considers a competent critical analysis. What these students need is some way to read hundreds of superior student essays, to mine them not for ideas--that's plagiarism, and plagiarism, as we all know, is the devil's third favorite past-time after putting idle hands to use and masturbation--but for proficiency. English undergraduates write terrible papers because they don't fucking get it. They can't because they're never exposed to what good undergraduate English essays look like; or they know what an abstract model of a good undergraduate English...</span></a></div>
