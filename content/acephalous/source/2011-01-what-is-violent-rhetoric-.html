Despite all the condemnation of everyone else's &quot;violent rhetoric,&quot; I've yet to see one post in which the term itself is defined. It seems to mean, in the current political vernacular, anything said by someone else that involves anything even remotely violent. Katrina Trinko's attempt to tu quoque Keith Olbermann is particularly enlightening, as it describes a number of angry statements by Olbermann that are neither violent nor rhetorical, e.g. In 2007, Olbermann called rival network Fox News “worse than al-Qaeda ... for our society” and said the channel was “as dangerous as the Ku Klux Klan ever was.” Neither of those statements are rhetorical because neither of them attempts to call its audience to action. For them to be rhetorical, as per Aristotle in On Rhetoric, they would need to be intended to persuade. Moreover, they would need to be intended to persuade a particular audience to undertake a particular action. This is the rhetorical triangle: Note the interconnectedness of the speaker and audience. The general problem with discussing rhetoric in the current media environment is that the particularity of the audience is absent. Anyone can read or watch or listen to anything without regard for their relation to the intended audience and without reference to the action whose commission the rhetor intends. In such a situation, it is not surprising when the mode of persuasion favored by speakers is the one that is most effectively general. To quote Aristotle again: The first [mode of persuasion] depends on the personal character of the speaker [ethos]; the second on putting the audience into a certain frame of mind [pathos]; the third on the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself [logos]. Though pathos is typically translated as an &quot;appeal to emotion,&quot; it is better understood as an &quot;appeal to imagination.&quot; Anything that stokes the imagination, be it an image or a narrative, fits the bill. It goes without saying that the majority of political rhetoric in America is, in this technical sense, pathetic. This is simply because most politicians have questionable ethos and very few have speechwriters sufficiently talented to produce persuasive logos. But it is also because most Americans are too suspicious of political motives to allow politicians to establish an ethos and too untrained in the literary arts to understand an appeal to logos. Typically, then, we are left in a situation in which politicians, as rhetors, design speeches whose pathos is general enough to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. It stands to reason that if we want to understand what &quot;violent rhetoric&quot; entails, we must focus on whose images and stories are stoking whose imaginations and to what effect.

<blockquote>
<p>The first [mode of persuasion] depends on the personal character of the speaker [<em>ethos</em>];  the second on putting the audience into a certain frame of mind [<em>pathos</em>]; the third  on the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself [<em>logos</em>].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though <em>pathos</em> is typically translated as an &quot;appeal to emotion,&quot; it is better understood as an &quot;appeal to imagination.&quot;&#0160; Anything that stokes the imagination, be it an image or a narrative, fits the bill.&#0160; It goes without saying that the majority of political rhetoric in America is, in this technical sense, pathetic.&#0160; This is simply because most politicians have questionable <em>ethos </em>and very few have speechwriters sufficiently talented to produce persuasive <em>logos</em>.&#0160; But it is also because most Americans are too suspicious of political motives to allow politicians to establish an <em>ethos </em>and too untrained in the literary arts to understand an appeal to <em>logos</em>.&#0160;</p>
<p>Typically, then, we are left in a situation in which politicians, as rhetors, design speeches whose <em>pathos </em>is general enough to appeal to as wide an audience as possible.&#0160; It stands to reason that if we want to understand what &quot;violent rhetoric&quot; entails, we must focus on whose images and stories are stoking whose imaginations <em>and to what effect</em>.&#0160; Pointing out that Keith Olbermann associated Fox News with terrorist organizations foreign and domestic does nothing of the sort because the audience and intended effect of his statements is unclear.&#0160; How unclear?</p>
<p>If we posit his intended audience is liberals and leftists who believe President Obama is a centrist—which strikes me as a fairly accurate assessment—then we need to ask what the intended effect <em>on that particular audience</em> of associating Fox News with al-Qaeda would be.&#0160; Keeping in mind that we are currently at war with al-Qaeda, are we to believe that Olbermann is encouraging liberals and leftists to join a military-like organization and wage an Afghanistan-type offensive against Fox News?&#0160; Given that his audience is composed of people who are, generally speaking, opposed to war, does that make any sense?&#0160; Or is it more likely that he is simply attempting to create an association of like-with-like in which the likeness is supremely unflattering?&#0160; His rhetoric here is pathetic and inflammatory, but from the perspective of what it is intended to persuade its audience, it is also incoherent.&#0160; It can&#39;t be considered &quot;violent&quot; because it in no way encourages its audience to have its imagination stoked by reference to violence.</p>
<p>Consider a slightly more infamous example:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c77ce826970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Map2-thumb-600x398-37217" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c77ce826970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c77ce826970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Map2-thumb-600x398-37217" /></a> <br />Here the intended audience is those who believe President Obama is a radical leftist and associates itself with the center-right.&#0160; Unlike the audience of liberals and leftists, who oppose war and favor a restrictive interpretation of the Second Amendment, this audience is more hawkish and more likely to support of an expansive interpretation of the Second Amendment.&#0160; I would contend that this is an example of &quot;violent rhetoric&quot; not because it contains crosshairs aimed at &quot;the candidates&quot; who represent &quot;the problem&quot; in need of &quot;solution,&quot; and despite the fact that talking about &quot;solving&quot; human beings has a rather untoward history, but because its violence is a product of whose imaginations are being stoked and how it is being done.&#0160;</p>
<p>The intended effect of this image is <em>not </em>to encourage the assassination of candidates; however, the pathetic appeal being made to this particular audience is certainly intended to stoke their imaginations in ways related to their ideological belief in an expansive interpretation of the Second Amendment.&#0160; This rhetoric is violent, then, because it was intended to appeal to an audience whose imaginations would be stoked by a reference to shooting things.&#0160; The same cannot be said of <a href="http://patterico.com/2011/01/09/left-and-media-but-i-repeat-myself-in-a-fact-free-frenzy-to-blame-palin-for-giffords-shooting/" target="_self">this similar map</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e173616d970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Leftists-Target-Republicans-2" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e173616d970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e173616d970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Leftists-Target-Republicans-2" /></a> <br />Why not?&#0160; Are bullseye that different from crosshairs?&#0160; Of course not.&#0160; However, the intended audience is: the imaginations of liberals and leftists who support a restrictive interpretation of the Second Amendment are not stoked by images of bullseyes.&#0160; They generally have no pathetic investment in crossbows and so appeals of this sort are less likely to be effective than those like the one above.&#0160; In terms of rhetoric, then, only the first of these two maps can be designated as &quot;violent&quot; because only it attempts to persuade its audience into action by stoking imaginations by referencing shooting things.*</p>
<p>So now that we have something resembling a proper working definition of &quot;violent rhetoric,&quot; the next question is whether &quot;violent rhetoric&quot; like Palin&#39;s is responsible for the assassination attempt on Gifford.&#0160; The answer is that I&#39;m not convinced.**&#0160; From what I&#39;ve read, he never expressed interest in guns until last November, so the likelihood of ads like hers stoking his imagination is slim.&#0160; The more pernicious rhetoric here is the conspiratorial variety being mainstreamed by the likes of Glenn Beck: rabid and ahistorical anti-federalism feeds into the beliefs of those who believe they&#39;re being persecuted by vast faceless conspiracies.&#0160;</p>
<p>*I suppose one possible objection is that shooting is not, in and of  itself, a violent act, but given that it specifically links the  crosshairs to candidates, I think that would be a difficult argument to  make here.</p>
<p>**That said, I do believe whichever party was responsible for the dismantling the mental health system—generally in the 1980s and more recently in Arizona—and consistently lobbies for fewer restrictions on the purchasing of powerful weaponry is partly culpable for what happened on Saturday.&#0160;</p>

<p>I mean, I think you could also say that liberals are OK with violence against perceived wrong doers, since many of them support the use of police violence (though I don&#39;t and mI think you prolly don&#39;t either.) and so couldn&#39;t you argue that Olbermann&#39;s likening to two outlaw organizations against whom violence would be justified is the same thing?  I&#39;m not saying I believe that, just that I think when you have to draw such a fine line to distinguish the two modes of speech that maybe they aren&#39;t that different after all.</p>

<p>So yea, define violent rhetoric and contextualize specifically enough and it may hold up logically, but it still comes off to me as the pot calling the kettle a slidely different shade of black.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you&#39;re basically defending the assertion that the right has a monopoly on violent rhetoric, which seems dismissable out of hand.</p></span>

<p>@NOT:</p>

<p><em>but the assertion that Palin&#39;s rhetoric is violent and Olbermann&#39;s isn&#39;t is entirely founded on the assumption that Palin&#39;s fans are violent and Olbermann&#39;s are not</em></p>

<p>Not really: they&#39;re defined as people more likely to favor an expansive interpretation of the Second Amendment, which doesn&#39;t necessarily make them more violent, just more prone to have their imaginations stoked by imagery related to guns.</p>

<p><em>you&#39;re basically defending the assertion that the right has a monopoly on violent rhetoric, which seems dismissable out of hand.</em></p>

<p>If that were the extent of violent rhetoric instead of an example of it, I&#39;d agree ... but to reverse what I wrote, it makes sense that imagery of the sort Palin used wouldn&#39;t be nearly as effective on Olbermann&#39;s audience, no?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e174ebc1970b-content"><p>This is a fine definition, however the fact that it excludes the Clear and Present Danger Test is — in my frank opinion — inappropriate. Oliver Wendell Holmes was faced with this type of problem in 1919, in <i>Schenck v. the United States</i>. Another important Supreme Court case to consider in this imbroglio is 1969&#39;s <i>Brandenburg v. Ohio</i>.  Although I&#39;m no legal professional, it is my opinion that these rulings should inform us as to what &quot;dangerous&quot; speech happens to be — especially since they are what would really matter in this situation. </p>

<p> Naturally, the definition is subjective: the audience does, as you said, matter; also, the call to action matters: how clear is it? Stroking the imagination is one thing, but it is another thing, in my opinion, to speak in depth and at length about a given action. From the perspective of a layman, it seems like this could easily turn into a difficult case to prosecute — if it were brought against Sarah Palin. Hal Turner&#39;s case was a no brainer, but Palin&#39;s, if it were brought into court, would probably not be an easy conviction; it is very likely, depending on the court, that the case could even be thrown out. At least, this is a layman&#39;s interpretation of the decisions. </p>

<p>&quot;The Court upheld the statute on the ground that, without more, &quot;advocating&quot; violent means to effect political and economic change involves such danger to the security of the State that the State may outlaw it. Cf. Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U.S. 380 (1927). But Whitney has been thoroughly discredited by later decisions. See Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494, at 507 (1951). These later decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.&quot; <i>Hess v. Indiana</i>.</p>

<p>Again, it seems that Turner&#39;s case is a no brainer — especially considering that he published information on the people he was threatening — but one brought against Palin would be a bit harder to prosecute. It will definitely, if it is brought to court, come down to the text on the picture: &quot;Help us prescribe the solution.&quot; The trial will probably be highly politicized, and, like many things involving Sarah Palin, have a circus atmosphere peculiar to her. Does this inspire imminent lawless action? is the text a clear and present danger to the listed candidates? and is the call to action clear? are all questions which should be asked; but, it&#39;s more likely that none of them — the important questions, or their important answers — will make their way to the viewers ears in the emotionally charged fracas. </p>

<p>Presumably, one against Glenn Beck could be just as hard; although I haven&#39;t regularly watched his program since he switched to Fox News, so all bets are off. </p></span>

<p>Let me stop you right there.  Particular wars?  Yes.  War generally?  No.</p>

<p>Second, the notion of an &quot;expansive interpretation of the Second Amendment&quot; is in no way necessarily aggressive.  Indeed, the right which the Second Amendment is protecting is one of self-defense.</p>

<p>Also, since liberals favor a greater role for government in private life, by nature a coercive power, it seems just as likely that liberals would favor using force to achieve their political ends.</p></span>

<p>Liberals tend to use &quot;coercive power&quot; in government (and have done so historically) as a check on individual liberty when that liberty infringes on the rights of others - my &quot;right&quot; to discriminate against someone else.  Conservatives are the ones who have shown that they use &quot;coercive power&quot; to limit individual freedom, even when that freedom effects no one else - the right to marry, etc.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re probably right that if we had laxer gun laws, with more people armed, things like the massacre in Tucson wouldn&#39;t have happened, right?  </p></span>

<p>That seems wrong to me.  Isn&#39;t Sarah Palin&#39;s Alaska essentially about projecting ethos?  Or consider the ethos of mavericks (mostly about ethos, though occasionally  turned into a discussion of whether or not maverick-ness is appropriate for the office of the president).  See also Obama&#39;s projection of ethos as cautious and fair-minded, possibly professorial--and the occasional  attempts to show anger.  All this is about ethos and the particular problems Obama faces in presenting ethos (can&#39;t be an angry black man, falling into elite educated thing, etc.).  When Bush dressed up in a flight suit or said, &quot;Bring it on&quot;--that&#39;s ethos.  Or when Clinton could feel your pain...  </p>

<p>Ethos is pervasive in political discourse and, I would say, as important as pathos.  <br />

<p>And back to the first part of your reply, there are a lot of pro-2nd Dems.  The Glock quote, again,  clearly shows that.</p>

<p>The &quot;left&quot; has engaged in violent acts and rhetoric a plenty in the past 60 years.  I think it&#39;s time us true pacifists start acknowledging that it&#39;s pandemic to both sides, not endemic to the &quot;others.&quot;</p>

<p>Using your own definition, Obama himself is constantly saying things with the intent to cause violence to an audience he knows will respond.  He calls them &quot;orders.&quot;</p></span>

Conservatives are the ones who have shown that they use &quot;coercive power&quot; to limit individual freedom, even when that freedom effects no one else - the right to marry, etc.</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the automatic first move, Matt, but it doesn&#39;t hold water.  Suffice to say, the only people consistent on this point are Libertarians, Anarchists, and your various totalitarian philosophies.</p></span>

Antonioni structures the film around a series of moments in which the sound and actors and actions are at odds with the world. The first involves the mimes at the beginning of the film: Why is that mime's mouth open? Because she is yelling. The second scene occurs slightly after this shot: The blonde on the left is willing to have sex with Thomas in exchange for photographs, but the brunette in the center is not. So what happens? The blonde helps Thomas strip her friend and he proceeds to rape her. How does she react? She laughs while resisting. The third scene occurs at the Yardbirds' concert: As Keith Relf sings about &quot;strolling on&quot; and Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck dual it out on guitars, the crowd remains eerily immobile. The fourth (and most famous) instance finishes up the film: Having retrieved and returned the imaginary ball for the (now silent) tennis-playing mimes, Thomas stares at them and begins to hear an actual tennis match. Why Antonioni created this disconnect between the sound and the onscreen actions in a film that obsesses on the visual is not a question I can answer at the moment. But it is significant that the screaming mimes, giggling victims, unmoved attendees and impossible tennis all contribute to the overweening sense of wrongness that permeates the film. What do I mean by that? In addition to the above, there is the opening sequence in which Antonioni violates the 180° rule by having the van full of mimes exit to and emerge from the right: Followed by an eyeline match between people in different areas of the city: To a bizarre series of cuts in which the camera seems to flip along the vertical axis as Thomas faces the camera: Then turns his back to it: Only to be facing it again immediately thereafter: It feels as if he walks into the camera, which then somersaults to catch his back before darting in front of him to catch his face again, almost as if Antonioni is doing to Thomas, his subject, what Thomas will shortly to do his: It makes a certain amount of narrative sense for the camera to dance in this fashion, if only because it places the audience in the role of the model being surveilled, but the result of this odd sequence of shots is a profound and deliberate disorientation. The audience is unclear where it stands with relation to the diegetic world depicted onscreen—which it now occurs to me may be the point. Just as Thomas relates, through his camera, to a world that has ceased making sense—as evidenced by his non-evidence of a crime he can't prove was committed—so too does the viewer relate to Thomas' world....</span></a></div>
