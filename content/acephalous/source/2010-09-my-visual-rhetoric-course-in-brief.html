Nor, for that matter, is anything accidental when it costs $80,000 per second to film it, which is why we then discuss how Christopher Nolan turns Batman into classic horror monster in Batman Begins. The point here is get them fluent in the language of film, so that they might make arguments about how directors manipulate the camera in order to appeal to the audience. (We also discuss what is and isn't in the diegetic space, e.g. music, which is heard by the audience but not the characters.) Then it's on to The Dark Knight.

Now that they're relatively fluent in the language of film, we try to prove something a little more complex; namely, that Superman Returns is very much about 9/11.

Now that they're comfortable with film, I get them to apply that knowledge to comics via the comic that's about the conventions of comics and is therefore utterly unfilmable, Watchmen. I begin by reminding them of the overdetermined nature of the image, then we discuss panel transitions and word-picture relation, move on layout and narrative flow, then I try to prove what I stated in the second sentence about Watchmen being a meta-comic. My argument's deliberately argumentative, because Dr. Manhattan can also function as a figure of the reader as well the author, but that's an argument I want to have. From there, it's onto the unfilmable film itself. Now that they can break film and comics into their constituent parts, I re-orient them in an explicitly rhetorical direction. We talk about the rhetorical situation, which is, of course, a triangle.

			<p>Because I had a conversation with a number of people about my last visual rhetoric course during orientation today, I&#39;m going to post my link-happy summary of it from last fall again (with a couple of notable additions):</p>
<ol>
<li> I introduce them to the idea of <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/teaching-the-overdetermined-image-.html">the overdetermined image</a>, because nothing is accidental in an Alan Moore script. </li>
<li>Nor, for that matter, is anything accidental when it costs $80,000  per second to film it, which is why we then discuss how Christopher  Nolan turns Batman into <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/batman-begins-works-because-christopher-nolan-decided-to-spend-the-first-hour-and-twenty-minutes-denying-the-audience-what-it.html">classic horror monster</a> in <em>Batman Begins</em>.  The point here is get them fluent in the language of film, so that they  might make arguments about how directors manipulate the camera in order  to appeal to the audience. (We also discuss what is and isn&#39;t in the  diegetic space, <em>e.g.</em> music, which is heard by the audience but not the characters.) </li>
<li>Then it&#39;s <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/dark-knight-scene-analysis.html">on to <em>The Dark Knight</em></a>. That link goes to a reading of the interrogation scene; <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/little-bit-more-on-teaching-the-dark-knight.html">this one</a> leads you to a similarly thorough analysis dedicated to proving the  controversial thesis that Batman is really fast—because demonstrating  that even the simplest of claims require evidence and careful argument  to be taken seriously is the point of the course. </li>
<li>Now that they&#39;re relatively fluent in the language of film, we try to prove something a little more complex; namely, that <em>Superman Returns</em> is very much about 9/11. First, I take them back to <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/prelude-to-a-scene-analysis-of-bryan-singers-superman-returns.html">September morning</a>; then we <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/superman-returns-.html">analyze the action sequence that&#39;s about planes slamming into NYC landmarks</a>, lest they think I&#39;m reading too much into the anxieties the film taps into.</li>
<li>Now that they&#39;re comfortable with film, I get them to apply that  knowledge to comics via the comic that&#39;s about the conventions of comics  and is therefore utterly unfilmable, <em>Watchmen</em>. I begin by reminding them of the overdetermined nature of the image, then we discuss <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/like-what-i-did-with-the-dark-knight-only-this-time-about-the-fourth-issue-of-watchmenin-making-comics-scott-mccloud-argue.html">panel transitions and word-picture relation</a>, move on <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/more-on-watchmen-dave-gibbons-layout-and-john-higgins-ink-in-the-age-of-mechanical-reproduction.html">layout and narrative flow</a>, then I try <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/03/dr-manhattan-as-a-figure-of-reader-of-alan-moores-watchmen.html">to prove what I stated in the second sentence about <em>Watchmen</em> being a meta-comic</a>.  My argument&#39;s deliberately argumentative, because Dr. Manhattan can  also function as a figure of the reader as well the author, but that&#39;s  an argument I want to have. From there, it&#39;s onto <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/03/watchmen-and-the-scene-of-reading-being-a-response-to-anthony-lanes-review-of-zak-snyders-adaptation.html#more">the unfilmable film itself</a>. </li>
<li>Now that they can break film <em>and</em> comics into their  constituent parts, I re-orient them in an explicitly rhetorical  direction. We talk about the rhetorical situation, which is, of course, <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/03/more-for-voyeurs-on-panel-transitions-and-narrative-speed.html">a triangle</a>.  (For the record: that silliness is me teaching myself to manipulate  images in Photoshop for my book on teaching visual rhetoric.) Then we  situate the rhetorical context <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/teaching-rhetoric-via-warren-ellis-planetary-batman-night-on-earth.html">in the historical context via Warren Ellis&#39;s <em>Planetary/Batman: Night on Earth</em></a>. </li>
<li><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/10/on-informing-your-students-that-theyre-murderers.html" target="_self">I call them all murderers</a> for the violence they perpetrate in the gutters.</li>
<li>From there on out, it&#39;s all about the writing.&#0160; I teach them about <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/05/how-to-structure-a-paragraph-with-a-hamburger.html">paragraph burgers</a>,  which, while silly, is the single most effective means I&#39;ve found to  teach paragraph structure. Students intuitively understand that you  don&#39;t call a pickle with and a piece of a cheese a &quot;hamburger.&quot; For the  remainder of the quarter, we use the tools from the beginning of the  course to make sophisticated arguments about the rhetorical stakes of  what they&#39;d otherwise dismiss as pop culture ephemera. </li>
<li>Finally, here is a link to a <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/12/an-end-of-the-quarter-treat-batman-is-my-boss.html" target="_self">descriptive list</a> of some of my more successful Rhetoric in Practive projects.</li>

I read through it, but right over my name, as well. So, I didn’t think Mr. Gerson was genuinely interested in what bloggers might actually think until now. h/t Newsbusters. Translation: Until someone else pointed out that he’d quoted me, I didn’t think he was interested in what people like me have to say. That’s a remarkable confession when you think about it, and says quite a bit about the current state of conservative blogs: everyone assumes they know what everyone else is thinking, so they stop reading what they actually write but continue to attack each other anyway. As far as I can gather—it’s rather confusing—it seems like the purity test of the week is not whether conservatives will be pragmatic and advocate voting for Christine O’Donnell, but whether they will hold their tongue or speak their piece about her obvious flaws as a candidate while doing so. Were I a fiscal conservative, I’d be bothered by the disconnect between her life and her professed ideals to the point of questioning whether the latter were nothing more than lip service; but as I am, for the most part, just chuffed that the Republicans of Delaware selected an unelectable candidate, I don’t feel the need to weigh in. Not even on the Donalde’s latest self-deflating argument, because I’m increasingly convinced that he’s engaged in some sort of performance art. No actual human, much less a teacher, could consider this an invitation to debate, or respond to its inevitable (and quite reasonable) rejection by issuing the following complaint: There’s a word for this: Anti-intellectualism. And that stance marinates in a devilish sauce of hard left-wing hubris and deceit. It’s further soaked in hatred, for to hate one’s enemies is to categorize them as beyond the pale of reason and civilization. The worst thing about this cooking show? The Donalde spent all night writing the script. So my choices are “sad, sad little man” or “brilliant performance artist,” and because I want to maintain my faith in humanity, I’m going with the latter.</span></a></div>

For example, I would've missed this: This tub! It is cursed and jiggles! Other examples abound, obviously, but none quite capture the tone-deafness of crowd-sourced translations quite as well as this one.</span></a></div>
