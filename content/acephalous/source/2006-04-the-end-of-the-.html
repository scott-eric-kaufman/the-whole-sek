<p>The vibe around [The Valve] has been terrible of late.&nbsp; Dismissive.&nbsp; Drained, nay! <em>desanguified</em>.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; An unhealthy percentage of our readership responds rigidly and unthinkingly to what we publish.&nbsp; Constitutionally incapable of actual research, this lot prefers to think intuitively.&nbsp; They are frequently hostile, with bitter and ill-tempered dispositions.&nbsp; They flap their corrosive tongues in an attempt to dominate conversation.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You heard me, ladies, I'm calling you out.&nbsp; I learned all about you in an article I read today:

</p><blockquote><p>Intellectual activities unsex a woman, and she pays a high price for her intellectual life.&nbsp; As a result, she is prone to all sorts of nervous disorders and may become severely maladjusted.&nbsp; There is little hope she will marry, and, in a few cases, her intellectual activities are said to make her frigid.&nbsp; In any case, intellectual activities seem to make some women cold and lacking in human warmth.</p></blockquote><p>

Of course, that only applies to our <em>unattractive</em> female readership, as the rare &quot;hottie&quot; (as the kids say) isn't even &quot;credible to many, and ingenious explanations are necessary to accont for her scholarly interests.&nbsp; Usually the explanation is some type of early psychological experience.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>&quot;Unattractive women,&quot; however, &quot;are perfectly credible as scholars and their interests in intellectual activities do not require any explanation.&quot;&nbsp; Better unspeakably traumatized than unattractive, as &quot;no greater misfortune can befall a woman than to be physically unattractive, and this misfortune of physical unattractiveness warps her soul and makes her a spiteful creature.&quot;</p>

<p>

I enjoy these sociological takes on literature more, perhaps, than I ought to.&nbsp; Moretti has his teams of researchers.&nbsp; I'd be (and, in fact, <em>am</em>) stuck reading shelves of terrible novels in order to generalize trends to my satisfaction.&nbsp; But I'm curious to know whether these stereotypes of male and female academics persist, or whether the countless <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/037571412X/diesekoschmar-20/">David Kapeshes</a> in contemporary letters, male and female alike, render them quaint.&nbsp; </p>

I can&#39;t believe you haven&#39;t made the obvious conclusion: professors appear in novels written by frustrated, socially and/or romantically inept male research assistants. I&#39;m sure only self-interested research tampering on the part of his RAs prevented Belok from seeing this.<br />

Seems like there have been more.  The next time you get the urge to write one of these, you should write two versions, the second of which explains in plain detail what you really mean, and put the second on a Web page somewhere.  Then link the first to the second at each paragraph.  Otherwise resign yourself to spending more and more time explaining that you really don&#39;t think X.</p></span>

<p>Unfortunately, Lauren, Rich is correct: I love to crack wise, but am also unfailingly polite, a combination which leads to endless wasted hours (fretting or apologizing).  I wish I could say it&#39;s a matter of needing thicker skin, but it&#39;s plenty tough when people attack me.  Not having much in the way of pride, I&#39;m not easily bothered by attacks; but the thought that I&#39;ve done something, that someone&#39;s misunderstood something I&#39;ve said, that bothers me.  Most people find it personally endearing, but even I&#39;m started to be annoyed by how it looks in print.  </p>

<p>(Yes, Rich, I need to update the link, and will shortly.)</p>

<p>Brian, I couldn&#39;t follow that formula, as it had many numbers.  But I&#39;m wagering it was correct, much like Belok&#39;s analysis...I kid, I kid.  </p></span>

<p>The idea of linking back to another post which indicates that one is, in fact, kidding.  That&#39;s not a bad idea, and it&#39;s actually something I&#39;d thought of doing yesterday.  I&#39;d actually collected a number of seemingly offensive articles yesterday--I&#39;m tracking down some information on turn of the century ideas about the evolution of feminity--and I was going to recommend them, but then realized that not everyone has JSTOR.

I&#39;m not sure, though, whether the fact that people still say what I mocked makes my satire more or less effective.  (I received an email earlier this evening claiming that mocking misogynists is, well, old hat, something not to be done anymore because there aren&#39;t any <i>real</i> misogynists around anymore to make the satire bite.  I&#39;m now inclined to believe that emailer completely and utterly wrong, both about this and Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs, to hop to another thread.)  But Jodi, to be frank, the reason I mock certain strands of thought is because I believe it creates an awareness of their existence/persistence, and I think such awareness a healthy thing.  So I resolve to continue to mock, without mercy, all those morons who insist that we still live...at some other historical moment than the one we actually inhabit.</p></span>

Myrna Friedman, a former partner in the soon-to-be-renamed Arlington law firm Sargeant &amp; Friedman, agreed. &quot;If you don't finish your string beans,&quot; said the former litigator for the US Navy Office of General Counsel, &quot;you won't get any desset.&quot; Former Chief Information Officer for Bristol-Myers Squibb, Susan O'Day, declined our request for an interview on account that it was almost bathtime. The woman in the dugout, former Padres' massage therapist Kelly Calabrese, was digusted and would have said something if it was her place to. &quot;If God had intended me to be heard,&quot; said the spitting image of Jennifer Aniston, &quot;He wouldn't have made me so pretty. Now what do you think of my new eyeliner? Do you think Jim will like it?&quot; But there are some women happy with the change. Pulitzer Prize-winner and former Times columnist Maureen Dowd noted how it would be easier to find a suitable husband now that she was a suitable wife. &quot;Who could love someone who didn't spend at least three hours a week cutting the crust off peanut-butter and jelly sandwiches?&quot; &quot;All those years, I spent reading books and writing columns failed to land me a Prince Charming. A few hours a day on my knees will change that.&quot; She added, &quot;Scrubbing toilets. On my knees scrubbing toilets.&quot; Others are not sure. &quot;Who does that guy think he is?&quot; asked an irate former law professor who asked not to be identified for fear her husband would retaliate for her speaking when not spoken to. &quot;He was as graceful around the bag as any first baseman ever to play to sport. I give him that. But to turn back the clock on women's issues with a single sentence? What right does he have to do that?&quot; He has every right, according to legal expert Tim Dwight. &quot;Women these days feel a real but entirely undeserved sense of entitlement.&quot; He then asked &quot;Did you hear the one about the woman and the computer? No? So what's the difference between a woman and a computer? You only have to punch information into a computer once.&quot; When reached for comment, Padres manager Bruce Bochy shrugged his shoulders and said &quot;I didn't think gender was even an issue anymore.&quot; And now, thanks to Keith Hernandez, it isn't.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/a_crosspost_bel.html"><span><strong>A Cross-Post Below, a Gift Above</strong> Tonight I confess my love for Matthew Sweet. Girlfriend in particular. But his &quot;Devil with the Green Eyes,&quot; off Altered Beast, may be my favorite song. Unfortunately, technical difficulties prevent me from sharing anything. So instead I'll let Holbo share by proxy. Last weekend, he introduced me to an album almost too indulgent to believe. Sweet teamed with Susanna Hoffs—yes, that Susanna Hoffs—on Under the Covers, an album worth its weight in warm fuzzy nostalgia. Hoffs' voice is as evocative now as it was when she hieroglyphed 'cross the screen twice daily on Nick Rocks! I know you're dying for a couple of samples. Too bad! You'll have to live with three of the worst songs on the album. Please, do not purchase the album and hear the rest of the songs, all of which are better than those three. (Although, good or no, the nostalgia's almost overwhelming enough to render those satisfying. They aren't. You crave the rest.) [Edit: No more gifts! I've overshot my bandwidth allotment and . . . suspect TypePad may be unhappy about that.] [What follows is a version of my initial response to the Spivak event. It seemed inappropriate earlier. I lacked the time to edit my complaints constructively last week, and still do. But I post them nonetheless, if only to deflate some preposterous claims forwarded elsewhere. I hide it all below the fold since it likely bores the lot of you. That said, it contains many pretty pictures, which we can discuss in isolation from the silly words which surround them. This will, however, be my final word on the matter.] Caravaggio, &quot;Doubting Thomas&quot; Mark Tansey, &quot;Doubting Thomas&quot; As I read Spivak's &quot;Scattered Speculation,&quot; I thought it strange that this text was forwarded as a counter-example. How could it not be considered highly eclectic? In tone and diction; in the allusive style of its argument; in its constant quotations from the traditional roster thinkers associated with what I'd call Theory, I could hardly think of a more illustrative example of the form. I was baffled. So I devised some scenarios. What some thought would happen: As everyone surrounded the figure they believed Jesus reanimate, I required solid evidence. I would have to pluck the wound. Once done, the other apostles would be proven correct. Our faith would become fact. Spivak would not be an example of Higher Eclecticism once I engaged her work seriously. What actually happened: As I stood in the middle road, I could not believe that ground had opened beneath our wheels. I had been a passenger, brought to this fissure by another, and she seemed unconcerned. Unbelieving. She stared at me, hand on shifter, oblivious to the altered rock face behind her. She would never believe what had happened. She would insist that Spivak was not an example of Higher Eclecticism despite abundant geological evidence to the contrary. In truth, she would floor the accelerator and wax triumphant when she reached her destination. &quot;Could you imagine such idiocy?&quot;...</span></a></div>
