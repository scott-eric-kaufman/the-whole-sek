The distinct sexualities of the Collins twins seem a boon to those who think homosexuals are etymological perverts: Jason has “turned aside” from the righteous path that is his birthright. Why did he do so? He was converted by childhood trauma or an agenda-driven homosexual into thinking his feelings for other men were normal; which is to say he “turned with” an individual who convinced him that other men were as attractive as women. God didn’t put the gay in him — someone abused it into him. Whether that abuse is sexual or rhetorical in nature matters less than the simple fact that it’s abuse. That it’s become socially acceptable for prime-time faggots to queer the very foundation of marriage is a sign that American culture’s in steep decline. Children are being converted into perverts — are turning with those who would turn them aside — and political correctness prevents decent people from objecting to this abuse. But all this talk of conversion and perversion obscures the fact that homosexuals haven’t always had their agenda implemented as precisely as a Zionist plot. Homosexuals were once considered a diaspora of narcissists who wandered the world looking for themselves. They were inverts. They’d “turned inward” and demanded of others the love the mirror denied them. Which is only to say that the operative metaphor changed. What was once thought to be a loathsome inversion of God’s love has become what happens to children when they watch Glee. Because when you introduce contemporary American culture into the classic conversion narrative you end up with a system of dissemination indistinguishable from infection. You don’t need to convince someone to “turn with” you if society’s “putting in” or “doing to” them what the homosexual agenda wants it to. Which is why conservatives express their concerns about Collins’s revelation by not caring with thunder. So long as they ignore its importance the epidemic can be contained. They want Collins to become a non-story. Hence the significance of the fact that Jason Collins has an identical twin brother who’s straight. The temptation to use Jarron Collins’s heterosexuality as proof that Jason was either converted to or infected by homosexuality will prove too great. That Jarron shares Jason’s DNA but not his perversion demonstrates once and for all that God doesn’t sanction the birth of gay babies.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
			<p>The most important aspect of Jason Collins’s decision to become the 
first theoretically employable openly gay male in a major American sport
 isn’t that this “accomplishment” requires that many qualifiers, but 
that he has a twin brother who’s a heterosexual. So much of the rhetoric
 about homosexuality focuses on whether God made homosexuals gay or 
whether they’ve <a href="http://deadspin.com/espns-chris-broussard-says-being-gay-is-an-open-rebel-484708467">turned their back on the Lord</a>
 by succumbing to learned perversions. The distinct sexualities of the 
Collins twins seem a boon to those who think homosexuals are 
etymological perverts: Jason has “turned aside” from the righteous path 
that is his birthright. Why did he do so? He was converted by childhood 
trauma or an agenda-driven homosexual into thinking his feelings for 
other men were normal; which is to say he “turned with” an individual 
who convinced him that other men were as attractive as women.</p>
<p>God didn’t put the gay in him — someone abused it into him. Whether 
that abuse is sexual or rhetorical in nature matters less than the 
simple fact that it’s abuse. That it’s become socially acceptable for 
prime-time faggots to queer the very foundation of marriage is a sign 
that American culture’s in steep decline. Children are being converted 
into perverts — are turning with those who would turn them aside — and 
political correctness prevents decent people from objecting to this 
abuse. But all this talk of conversion and perversion obscures the fact 
that homosexuals haven’t always had their agenda implemented as 
precisely as a Zionist plot. Homosexuals were once considered a diaspora
 of narcissists who wandered the world looking for themselves. They were
 inverts. They’d “turned inward” and demanded of others the love the 
mirror denied them.</p>
<p>Which is only to say that the operative metaphor changed.</p>
<p>What was once thought to be a loathsome inversion of God’s love has become what happens to children when they watch <em>Glee</em>.
 Because when you introduce contemporary American culture into the 
classic conversion narrative you end up with a system of dissemination 
indistinguishable from infection. You don’t need to convince someone to 
“turn with” you if society’s “putting in” or “doing to” them what the 
homosexual agenda wants it to. Which is why conservatives express their 
concerns about Collins’s revelation by <a href="http://twitchy.com/2013/04/29/its-2013-nbas-jason-collins-comes-out-as-gay-clinton-swoons-others-yawn-who-cares/">not caring <em>with thunder</em></a>. So long as they ignore its importance the epidemic can be contained. They want Collins to become a non-story.</p>
<p>Hence the significance of the fact that Jason Collins has an 
identical twin brother who’s straight. The temptation to use Jarron 
Collins’s heterosexuality as proof that Jason was either converted to or
 infected by homosexuality will prove too great. That Jarron shares 
Jason’s DNA but not his perversion demonstrates once and for all that 
God doesn’t sanction the birth of gay babies. Jason couldn’t have been 
born this way because Jarron was too <em>and look at him</em>. Which 
means homosexuality is essentially a function of bad parenting: parents 
either didn’t pay enough attention to who tended to or played with their
 children or they allowed their children to be exposed to the pernicious
 influence of American culture. Better parenting can prevent children 
from being converted or infected by homosexuality by regulating who 
their children meet and what culture they partake.</p>
<p>That Jason and Jarron met the same people and partook of the same 
culture isn’t significant because the first theoretically employable 
openly gay male in a major American sport couldn’t have been<em> born</em>
 homosexual. Science says that stuff with the same genes is identical 
and therefore the gay can’t be genetic. You’ll see this argument 
repeatedly in the coming months — not because it’s valid but because 
Jarron Collins prefers sex with women. No grand conversation about how 
the same genes can express themselves differently depending on 
environmental factors will be had. The word “epigenetic” will not enter 
the national discourse. Why not?</p>
<p>Because as I type these words conservative “journalists” are combing 
through Jarron Collins’s life trying to discover where it differs from 
Jason’s. They’re searching for the Holy Grail of Gay and will use their 
rudimentary understanding of genetics to prove that someone either 
proffered Jason a sip or forced it down his throat. Jarron will become 
proof that Jason could’ve been “normal.” In short the “facts” of this 
particular case — as they understand them — accord too neatly with 
operative conservative metaphors for them to let it become a non-story. 
They will run with this because they mistake language for logic. They 
will run with this because they mistake logic for science. They will run
 with this because it eliminates God from the suspect pool.</p>
<p>And unless we point out that theories based on “conversion” and “infection” as are arbitrary as those predicated on “inversion” <em>they will be successful</em>.</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef019101ac436e970c-content"><p>In the long run, this can only be good for the cause of sexual equality and freedom. Everyone who&#39;s been paying attention knows that the &quot;born this way&quot; rhetoric being thrown around by certain sectors of the mainstream gay rights movement was a time bomb: a disingenuous oversimplification of something (human sexuality and sexual identity) that is not simple in the least. Embracing the naturalistic fallacy and trying to redirect its prescriptive ends is a terrible strategy if your goal is freedom and equality. I understand why it happened, and desperate times sometimes call for desperate measures, but the time has come to abandon that ramshackle strategy and play the long game.</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking forward to the day when someone can say: &quot;I could have been a different person, but I like being like this and doing what I do, and I have every right to be this way and do these things, or to be a different way and do different things tomorrow if I so choose&quot; and have that statement affirmed by mainstream society. This news story takes us one step closer to the reckoning that will bring that about.</p></span>

How could it not be yet another one of those posts?) I say “surprisingly” because the show’s producer — and at this point, principle director — is David Slade and I’m not exactly a fan of his work. That means Hannibal is a litmus test for my brand of auteur theory, because I’m genuinely impressed by some of his work here and consider him a derivative hack with all the subtlety of a nine-year-old learning to play the trumpet: whatever talent he possesses is masked by the fact that all he can do is blow. I took the fact that he does so as hard as he can for as long as he can sustain his breath as a fairly damning character flaw. But Hannibal suggests he may have finally learned something. For those of you who know nothing of American popular culture, Hannibal is a show about a man named Hannibal Lecter. He’s a serial killer who loves playing psychological games with know-it-all FBI agents. That’s the show’s motivating irony: he’s contacted by the FBI to provide psychiatric support for their most gifted criminal profiler. He’s solving crimes! While copycatting them! Talk about dramatic irony! The point being that this is a show about people with deep insight into the thought and behavior of sociopaths who fail to notice that their consultant’s therapist is one. It’s a show about psychological isolation — about people who can’t interact with the world or the people who inhabit it because there’s a felt distance between themselves and their humanity. So it only makes sense that even when they’re together, they’re alone. In “Potage,” for example, Lecter meets with the head of the FBI’s behavioral science division and one of their top psychiatrists: The long shot establishes that they’re all in the same room, which is important because if it didn’t, you might not realize that. The conversation proceeds via a series of medium close-ups in shallow focus: The depth of field is so shallow that the items on the front of his desk as unfocused as the wall behind him. His body occupies the thin slice of the world that the camera and lighting conspire into focus. Same with her: And with him: The three of them are sitting in the same room but are connecting neither with it nor each other. Their psychological isolation is being represented by the thin slice of the diegetic world that happens to be in focus. How thin is it? Thinner than this man’s face. It’s almost as if this man — the aforementioned criminal profiler — doesn’t even understand himself. Maybe he should see somebody about that. That’s right — he already is and it’s not working. You can tell because even when Slade switches from medium close-ups that suggest that all men are islands to two-shots that should suggest companionship, the thin depth of field isn’t even ample enough to include both subjects in focus. How isolated...</span></a></div>
