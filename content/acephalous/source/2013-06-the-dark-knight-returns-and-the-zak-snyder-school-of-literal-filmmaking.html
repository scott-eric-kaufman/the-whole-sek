 the callousness with which the redheaded man walks through the pool of

 interior narration of the journal to when Rorschach actually appears:</p>

<p>Same lines from the first panel of the comic, they’ve just been 
shifted forward to remove the mystery of their author. There’s just one 
problem: in the film, the implication is that Rorschach’s thinking about
 the awfulness of the city when he discovers the Comedian’s badge. His 
behavior’s motivated by his disdain for the people he deigns to protect.
 His anger drives his actions in a very conventional manner: this man 
named, clearly identified as Rorschach, is a moralistic vigilante who 
prowls the streets at night preventing crime, picking up shit from sewer
 drains and inexplicably using grappling guns. He’s in a mood — the only
 one he ever has — and he happens to find something that sets him off 
again. Not so much in the novel:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/watchmen06.jpg"><img alt="" height="282" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/watchmen06.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="watchmen06" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Notice how quiet Moore and Gibbons’ panels are. By shifting the 
narration from the zoom out to Rorschach’s discovery of the Comedian’s 
pin, Snyder’s demonstrated that he fundamentally misread those three 
panels. The point of them — which will be made more strongly shortly — 
is to establish Rorschach’s skills as a detective. It’s too easy to turn
 a character of Rorschach’s pedigree into a mindless vigilante, which is
 why Moore and Gibbons use <em>Watchmen</em>‘s opening pages to 
establish his credentials as a detective. He finds evidence of the 
Comedian on the street; stares it down in attempt to ascertain where it 
came from; then decides it must have fallen. Only then does he look up 
at the building. It’s a slow and contemplative progression of panels 
that the film turns into an minor action sequence complete with “all the
 [drowning].” And of course once Rorschach arrives on scene:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/watchmen07.jpg"><img alt="" height="449" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/watchmen07.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="watchmen07" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>He says nothing, because he’s investigating. He’s thinking<em> his own thoughts</em>
 about what he sees. If he had a Watson or a Wilson or a companion he’d 
be vigorously shushing them at this point because he needs to think. In 
the film?</p>

<p>He’s thinking that <em>right there</em> as he’s perched in the 
window. He’s not being an effective detective — he’s being a bitter 
blogger stuck doing something else but silently composing posts he’ll 
write when he gets the chance. Even though they made the juxtaposition 
of the journal clear when he first opened his mouth by having him 
“think-read” “Rorschach’s journal, October 12, 1985,” the manner in 
which Snyder uses the non-diegetic voice-over in the scene makes it 
appear to be a interior monologue, right down to the emphatic 
eighties-action-hero-overstatement of his final “No.”</p>
<p>It’s actually a little more complex than that. Interior monologues 
are typically considered to be non-diegetic — in that they don’t come 
from a source visible on-screen — but I’d argue that, in film generally,
 they’re diegetic inasmuch as they are coming from a visible source, <em>e.g. </em>I
 can see Rorschach’s head and think I’m hearing his thoughts as he’s 
having them. Which is why this is a little complex: he’s not actually 
thinking the thoughts the audience is attributing to him, unless he’s 
got an perfect recall and is reciting his journal to himself. <em>In 1985. Or possibly later if this is a flashback</em>.
 All of which is only to demonstrate how needlessly complicated Snyder’s
 made this scene in order to streamline it: now Rorschach’s journal is 
introduced while he arrives at the Comedian’s apartment. He thinks 
nothing’s lost by transposing Rorschach’s mad rantings onto his work as a
 detective. He’s wrong.</p>
<p>The point of keeping Rorschach’s journal distinct from his detective 
work in the opening pages is to create, in the mind of the audience, a 
distinction between the man and the mask. The man, Walter Kovacs, is a 
violent sociopath; the mask, Rorschach, can channel the man’s tendencies
 into productive policing and temper his violence. This distinction 
indicates that he’s going to be a character whose psychological state is
 difficult to read. It’s almost like people will see what they want to 
see in him because<em> he’s wearing a fucking Rorschach test</em>. By 
which I only mean to suggest that despite his fidelity to the panels, 
Synder’s missed the entire point of the scene in order to make it more 
conventional. That’s why his Rorschach says quite a bit more than Moore 
and Gibbon’s:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Watchmen-0108.jpg"><img alt="" height="788" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Watchmen-0108-650x1024.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Watchmen 0108" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Rorschach’s “HUNH” and “EHH” are thinking noises of the sort people 
make when lost deep in thought. In the third panel, Rorschach recognizes
 that the size of the interior of the closet seems odd; in the fourth, 
he improvises a means of measuring the closet’s depth; in the fifth he 
measures the exterior; in the sixth he measures the interior. And Moore 
and Gibbons are clever enough to emphasize the crook in the hanger. It’s
 literally in the dead center of the fifth panel — meaning <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/like-what-i-did-with-the-dark-knight-only-this-time-about-the-fourth-issue-of-watchmenin-making-comics-scott-mccloud-argue.html">it’s in the dead center of a page scripted by Alan Moore and therefore quite important</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/watchmen08.jpg"><img alt="" height="789" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/watchmen08.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="watchmen08" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Only when he compares the location of the crook on the interior in 
panel six does Rorschach realize that there’s a secret compartment. 
These panels are evidence of a process of deduction at work. He’s more 
than a vigilante obsessed with a citizenry slipping into sin — he’s a 
proper detective who’s capable of improvisation in the course of his 
investigations. Or he opens a random closet, slides the clothes aside 
and sees a button:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/rorschach.png"><img alt="" height="281" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/rorschach.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="rorschach" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Then he presses it. Great work there Detective Rorschach! Not sure 
how you thought of that! I think my point is obvious: Snyder may be 
faithful to the design elements of particular panels, but more often 
than not he entirely misreads the significance of the work he slavishly 
imitates. Now that I’ve established that, I can say that a similar 
dynamic is at work in <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>: panels from the 
graphic novel appear on the screen in a manner that demonstrates the 
Olivia, the director, didn’t quite understand their import. Consider 
this action sequence in which the Batman runs across a tightrope from 
one building to another:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00295.png"><img alt="" height="282" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00295.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - the quality of mercy00295" width="502" /></a></p>
<p>Is shot square in his symbol and staggers:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00300.png"><img alt="" height="281" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00300.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - the quality of mercy00300" width="501" /></a></p>
<p>Begins to fall:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00310.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00310.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - the quality of mercy00310" width="499" /></a></p>
<p>Then fires his grappling gun at an escaping helicopter:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00318.png"><img alt="" height="281" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00318.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - the quality of mercy00318" width="501" /></a></p>
<p>This sequence seems like typical heat-of-the-moment Batman: expensive
 body armor and years of training allow him to routinely do the 
impossible. He doesn’t need to think — he’s a man of pure reaction. Even
 after all these years of <em>not </em>being the Batman — the word 
“Returns” is in the title for a reason — his instincts allow him to act 
unconsciously. Such is the impression created by the adaptation. One 
problem: although that last capture above does reproduce <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/BatmanTDKR1_052_The_Dark_Knight_Returns.jpg">an iconic silent splash page</a>, the rest of those panels should sound, via interior monologue, like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/BATMAN01.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/BATMAN01.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="BATMAN01" width="499" /></a><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/BATMAN02.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/BATMAN02.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="BATMAN02" width="499" /></a><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/BATMAN03.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/BATMAN03.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="BATMAN03" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Whereas with Rorschach there should’ve been <em>no </em>interior monologue, in <em>The Dark Knight Returns </em>there
 should have been. The point of the book is that Batman’s falling off 
buildings worried about having a heart attack and trying to console 
himself on the dignity of his impending death. Those are very 
un-Batman-like things to be thinking in the middle of a fight. 
Eliminating the interior monologue has reduced him to his body — which I
 grant is the point of many a Batman story, <em>e.g. </em>Bruce Wayne escaping the vaguely Asian pit in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. It’s just not the point of this one. It’s the <em>opposite</em>
 of the point. But as with Synder, the desire to be faithful to the 
original work has resulted in something utterly different and more 
mundane. I led with the discussion of Rorschach because I don’t want 
people to assume that I’m making the common criticism that comics handle
 interiority better than film because we can “see” people think in them.
 That’s not the point — especially not with a Frank Miller book, since 
the tone of the interior monologue comes straight from film noir’s 
tradition of voice-overs — which, of course, comes from the first person
 perspective of the detective novels on which they were based, but 
that’s not the point either. The point here is that the films of two of 
the greatest graphic novels of the 1980s are both significantly worse 
than they have to be because they were adapted by people <em>who fundamentally didn’t understand how they worked</em>.</p>
<p>They’re the equivalent of a parrot trained to greet visitors with a hearty “Hello! Good to see you!” It doesn’t have<em> a fucking clue what it’s saying</em> but somehow we’re convinced we hear language.</p>

Here we are blathering on about “Walk of Punishment” (S03E03). Don’t watch — because you can’t — us discuss “And Now His Watch Has Ended” (S03E04). The rudely interrupted first half of our discussion of “Kissed by Fire” (S03E05). The second half of our discussion of religion in “Kissed by Fire” (S03E05).

Oh Really?</strong> The season finale of Mad Men, “In Care Of,” contains an inordinate number of what I call “Oh Really?” reverse shots. They typically don’t involve dialogue — and the episode will end with one that doesn’t — but at the beginning of the episode it does. It’s also odd because it substitutes a flashback for an “Oh Really?” escalation, but I’m getting ahead of myself. When representatives from the Sheraton Royal Hawaiian arrive at whatever the name of the firm is at this point — because not knowing the firm is part of the point at this point — Don Draper isn’t in the office. You may remember the Royal Hawaiian from the season premier, and if you do, you can probably anticipate Don’s whereabouts. Here he is at the Royal Hawaiian: That’s the opening shot of Draper at the Royal Hawaiian’s bar. Note the quality of the light: there are two on screen sources — the lamp to Don’s left and the Tiki fixture to his right — and a noticeable off-screen, but still diegetic light illuminating the painting from above. The lighting is high-key, that is, the back and fill lights complement the key light in a way that creates low contrast between brighter and darker areas. (I write “complement” because there are many ways the effect of high-key lighting can be produced: all manners of angles and intensities come into play.) Of the previous episode, “The Quality of Mercy,” I noted that Don’s shadows were eating at his face because the back and fill lights weren’t providing it illumination. Even though his back is turned in the shot above, were Don to turn around his face would be plenty covered by the back light. All of which is only to say that the light is natural and gentle in this scene at the Royal Hawaiian bar. Which is significant given that when the Royal Hawaiian representatives arrive in New York, Don’s not available to greet them because he’s here: At this point, I hope you don’t need me to point out the structural similarities between these two shots. There are many ways to shoot a man at a bar — I know, I know — but to shoot the same man regarding relations with the same corporation in such a similar manner invites comparison. Whereas the scene at the Royal Hawaiian is lit in a high-key, this is clearly lit in the low-key that’s characterized Don’s relation to alcohol the past three episodes. (Just look at the poor man pouring vodka.) The low-key lighting allows the diegetic lights sources — the illuminated bar and the television set — to provide the majority of the illumination. Meaning there isn’t much of any because Don’s in a darker place. Remember the “dark wood” that Don read about Dante awakening in while at the Royal Hawaiian? Clearly Don hadn’t actually reached it yet. At the brightly lit bar he interacted with an American icon — the serviceman on shore leave...</span></a></div>
