        <meta name="description" content="(The analysis itself spiraled out of control because Bryan Singer is a lunatic who bobs and weaves and cuts constantly. More on that tomorrow.) It goes without saying that Bryan Singer's Superman Returns (2006) is not a very good film. Or so I thought before hitting up Rotten Tomatoes. Let me put it this way: I think Superman Returns is a mediocre but interesting film. If you look at my chart you can probably guess why: the film mines the imagery of 9/11 in order to address the shit mist of uncertainty Americans fumbled through from 9/12 forward. The Americans in the film had themselves a Superman and the supreme confidence having a Superman entails. Then they lost him. Suddenly and inexplicably. Singer wants his audience to imagine what it would be like to wake up one morning and realize that the truly terrible things that never happen here can now happen here. Not too hard. I remember staring numbly at video of the first Tower smoking when I saw the nose of the second plane enter the frame: I was watching the truly terrible things that never happen here happening here and I felt sick. The sense of security I lost that morning never returned. No amount of anything will ever bring it back . . . with the possible exception of the arrival of Superman. The Americans in the film have learned to live without Superman. Or so they tell themselves. Lois Lane wins a Pulitzer for a stiff upper lip of an article entitled &quot;Why the World Doesn't Need Superman&quot; but the article has all the conviction of an empty gesture. (&quot;I never really loved you either!&quot; says the man whose girlfriend just left him.) When Clark Kent suddenly reappears after five years of being elsewhere, the audience knows what the Americans in the film don't: they can quiet that nagging nothing in the pit of their guts and breathe a little easier because Superman is back. Untangling why actual Americans are happy for their fake brethren is something of a chore, so let me leave it at this: 9/11 so rattled our presumptions that we experience real pleasure at the very thought that someone out there might reclaim some of the gusto they lost that morning even if that someone is an imitation American on a Sydney sound stage. Whatever the circumstances, the film's most powerful moment was always going to be when Superman reappeared. But Singer goes one step further and stages this scene in a manner designed to prime our 9/11 pumps without calling attention to what makes us shit the sheets (terrorism generally and Islamic fundamentalism in particular). All the props are there—the airplanes, the New York City landmarks, the air traffic controllers—but Singer stripped them of their normal significance so they only horrify secondhandedly. The scene I'll analyze tomorrow is equivalent to what the man who lost control over his car and slammed into a ditch in December feels when he starts..." />

I agree. I fully intend on leaving this series of posts immersed and hypothermic. JPool noted that treating paintings like panels could be a category error and Miriam and Gene implicitly agreed, suggesting I might be better served by a Hogarth or one of his ilk. I agree. But I chose to go with Caravaggio and Blake over Giotto and Hogarth because I wanted to focus attention on an individual image before I moved to discussing the interaction between multiple images arrayed in narrative. Andrew liked the arrows and will be disappointed with this post. Now that I have well and cleared my throat, let us venture forward to William Blake and &quot;The Tyger&quot; from Songs of Experience (1794). It reads: Tyger! Tyger! burning bright In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry? In what distant deeps or skies Burnt the fire of thine eyes? On what wings dare he aspire? What the hand dare sieze the fire? And what shoulder, &amp; what art. Could twist the sinews of thy heart? And when thy heart began to beat, What dread hand? &amp; what dread feet? What the hammer? what the chain? In what furnace was thy brain? What the anvil? what dread grasp Dare its deadly terrors clasp? When the stars threw down their spears, And watered heaven with their tears, Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the Lamb make thee? Tyger! Tyger! burning bright In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye Dare frame thy fearful symmetry? Where to start? Should I go full Keats and spend a day on each stanza? Probably . . . especially when you consider that 1) his manuscript looked like this: Because 2) he spent tedious years perfecting the placement of every word on every line. Maybe I'll declare next week Blake Week and do just that. But tonight I want to focus on the general impression of feline bad-assedness created by the text of the poem. What we have here is a TYGER! MADE OF FIRE FORGED BY DREAD HANDS AND SHARP TOOLS OF METALLURGY TO HAVE DREAD PAWS. So FEROCIOUS is this FIRE TYGER! that the poet cannot even imagine THE ABOMINABLE FOUNDRY in which SOME DEMENTED LORD created SO GRIM A BEAST.

Earlier installments can be found here: Batman Begins (first glimpse of Batman-as-classic-horror-monster at the docks: depth of field, continuity editing, eyeline match) The Dark Knight (interrogation scene: focus, lighting, framing, shot selection) The Dark Knight (fundraiser scene: camera movement, blocking, mise-en-scene) If it seems like there's a lot of narrative sans analysis in there, that's because there is. One assignment for Tuesday is that the students need to select one of the frames I didn't analyze and describe its formal properties (framing, lighting, &amp;c.). (The moments when I narrate the plot are likely the most compelling for those not interested in Film Theory 101 because I wrote them plenty funny.) Unlike my earlier posts I skipped a lot of frames. Why? Because director Bryan Singer is a loon whose camera only stops panning once in this entire sequence and there are only so many hours in the day/seconds in your attention span. We begin with a computer simulation of what's supposed to happen: Singer provides a template his audience can refer to. (Note that in the simulation the camera is above the plane. This will be important.) He pulls the camera back into a close-up on the nice stewardess lady who's explaining in her nice-stewardess-lady voice what's happening in the simulation: This would be a good time to mention that Singer films this scene like the obsessive former film student he is. The camera never stops moving. Never. The only reason this close-up doesn't become a medium close-up is because he cuts to Lois Lane asking a question. At this point the camera glides slowly and fluidly—not unlike the plane on the simulation—creating a sense of constant motion without any excitement. Then he cuts to Lois with a workmanlike reverse shot: But it's an odd reverse shot. Lois meets the stewardess's eye but there's no eyeline match because the stewardess responds to everyone on the plane: Because viewers expect eyeline matches in shot/reverse shot sequences, the stewardess's response feels like a snub. Singer violates convention in order to evoke an emotional response from the audience and does so with great efficiency: he doesn't need for Lois to look snubbed or say she feels snubbed because the editing took care of that for him. He then reverse cuts back to Lois: Who never appears to break eye contact with the stewardess. Keeping the one-sided match makes Lois seem determined. With his next cut he reveals something we had no reason to suspect: that this shot sequence has a source in the scene itself. This has a mildly unsettling effect. Singer tells the audience that he's willing to withhold critical information. What we see may be focalizing through the needs of a particular character (the network cameraman) or those of the director (Singer himself) or both. I say &quot;both&quot; because Singer immediately cuts to a point of view shot from the cameraman's perspective as he whip pans from Lois to the stewardess: The camera stops and...</span></a></div>
