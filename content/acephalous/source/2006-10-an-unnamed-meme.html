<li>This desire for trivial information extends to my academic work. 
Instead of focusing on major figures of actual artistic merit, I have

Era.&nbsp; Popular authors like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silas_Weir_Mitchell">Silas Weir Mitchell</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill_%28novelist%29">Winston Churchill</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Dixon_%28minister%29">Thomas Dixon</a>

though the desire to work on noncanonical literature may be, I suggest
others distinguish works <em>justly</em> from those <em>unjustly</em> forgotten before devoting three years to studying them.</li></ul>

<p><strong>The Not Entirely Unintellectual</strong></p>

<ul><li>I believe that minds work best when crammed full of on-going narratives.&nbsp; Not <em>quality </em>narratives—at
least not necessarily so—but a brain full of bookmarks helps keep a
mind healthy.&nbsp; What do I mean?&nbsp; What happened on the last episode of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FVQLIO/diesekoschmar-20"><em>House</em></a>?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000GFLEAO/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Battlestar Galactica</em></a>?&nbsp; The last issue of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000IMEZ9W/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Y - The Last Man</em></a>?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/078512358X/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Runaways</em></a>? 
You see where I'm headed here: earlier print cultures forced people to
track hundreds of characters as they danced through serial
entertainment.&nbsp; Movies are events—forceful but quickly forgotten.&nbsp; They
aren't <em>lived with </em>the way serials are.&nbsp; I throw my body on the
couch and my brain kicks into overdrive: &quot;Where are we?&nbsp; What happened
to him?&nbsp; Her?&nbsp; How did he react?&nbsp; How did she?&nbsp; Why are we here?&quot; 
Question piles upon question until I've sorted through everything and
form a reasonable approximation of the present <em>in media res </em>moment
constituted by the splash page or opening credits.&nbsp; With a novel, the
involvment is intense but fleeting.&nbsp; Even the longest novel is only
inhabited for a few days tops.&nbsp; You can re-read it, but re-reading
brings a different set of critical faculties into play than does the <em>up-to-now </em>reconstruction
a serial demands.&nbsp; Plus, those moments when you distinctly remember
Greg House slugging it out with a fifty-foot tall cybernetic Godzilla? 
<em>Priceless</em>.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060958324/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em></a>
was the first book I took myself too seriously for reading.&nbsp; I made a
show of my profundity by ostentaciously reading it at Coffee Call, café
intelligent women were known to frequent.&nbsp; Of course, intelligent women
didn't actually frequent it ... and if they had, none worthy of the
adjective would've flown to the Pirsig fan.&nbsp; They would have laughed. 
The women most likely—statistically speaking—to have laughed at this
preening high school junior worked at the chocolateer across the
mall-way.&nbsp; Future biographers (and lonely, pretentious bachelors)
should take note: one such women would eventually marry me.</li>

<li>I considered <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em> the
first &quot;intellectual&quot; book I'd ever read despite having spent every
Christmas break since I'd had two digits to my age re-reading <em>Moby Dick</em>. 
You need no longer imagine the depths of my stupidity.&nbsp; My routine, for
those interested, consisted of looking out my window to see whether it
was raining again (it was); sticking my hand out the front door to see
whether the rain stung (it did); trying to squeeze in a few hours of
Nintendo before the downpour killed the power (inevitable); filching a
bag of Christmas-colored, sprinkle-covered chocolate chips from the
cookie jar (easy); lighting enough candles to read by but not so many
as to set off the smoke detectors (tricky); and reading <em>Moby Dick </em>to
the sound of driving rain, by the Goldilocks o' candle light and with a
bowl of stolen holiday confections on my lap (priceless).</li></ul>

<p><strong>The Entirely Unintellectual</strong></p>

<ul><li>I won't be posting tomorrow because I'll be watching the Mets
fulfill my wildest dreams ... by which I mean 1) clinching a spot in
the next round of the playoffs or 2) not clinching so that I might
watch them clinch it on Sunday. </li>

<li>Two nights ago, I was up until 4 a.m. reading <em>The Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience</em>, <em>Current Opinion in Neurobiology </em>and
the like.&nbsp; Tonight, I notice the clock says 1:45 a.m. and I'm watching
stuff about mounting next generation subwoofers in the center console
and building a mobile office in a trunk.&nbsp; As much as I hate to say it,
I'm a fan of the &quot;How Things Work&quot; genre.&nbsp; Give me an hour on the
Discovery Channel about how analgesics work and I'm a happy man.&nbsp; You
want to <a href="http://science.discovery.com/convergence/deconstruction/future/future.html">deconstruct the house of the future</a>?&nbsp; I'm your man.&nbsp; </li>

<li>By which I mean, I'll watch professionals do anything.&nbsp; Hire a
carpenter and I'll stand over his shoulder making him uncomfortable. 
The plumber?&nbsp; He better not mind showing me how to do whatever the hell
he's doing under there.&nbsp; Sure, it's a tight fit ... but that doesn't

Who am I tagging?&nbsp; No one.&nbsp; I want someone to surprise me.&nbsp; At least
one person, but six would be great.&nbsp; So one of you lurkers take up the
task and send me a trackback.&nbsp; I'll gladly share my traffic to get to
know y'all better.</p>

Preserving Cultural Uniqueness On its face, the most salient criticism of Michaels’ discussion of language extinction invokes the idea that every language offers a unique perspective on the world—a perspective which is, if lost, irrevocably so. The weak form of this criticism insists that categories embedded in a given language tell us something about the ideology of its speakers. The most common example comes not from an endangered language, however, but from one spoken by 75,500,000 people: Javenese. Theoretically, Javanese speakers move between these registers based on their social status relative to that of their interlocutor.[1] If Javanese died, so too would intimate knowledge of the worldview it afforded its speakers. Despite myself, I’m sympathetic to this argument: linguists can learn more about a living language and its relation to the society of its speakers than they can infer from a dead one. But once a language has been thoroughly studied, what necessary investment should anyone have in keeping it alive? Many would answer “Because its life entails the cultural life of its speakers and their unique way of looking at the world.” Fair enough. Only what if we find its uniqueness morally repugnant? What if the perspective it preserves is violently misogynistic? I take this to be the point of Michaels’ hypothetical culture of American segregationists: What if American segregationists had described themselves as participating in a culture of segregation and had said ... that they didn’t, of course, claim that segregation was good for everyone but they did claim it was good for them and that their culture had a right to survive. (153) If they spoke a language all their own—a Southerner with relatives throughout rural Mississippi might even say they do—and still practiced segregation, claims that their culture deserved preservation on account of its uniqueness would be rare. Once linguists finished cataloguing the humilifics used to identity African-American skin-tone, most everyone except for the segregationists would call for the destruction of that culture, its uniqueness be damned. The moral imperative to preserve different cultures, I would argue, genuflects both to the pernicious myth of Western superiority and that of the noble savage: “Our lives can be enriched by your perspective, so we’re gonna send in the 51st Fightin’ Wordhordes to make sure you don’t go and die before doing us this good turn.&quot; I think Michaels is right to link the persistence of culture to something more “ought” than “is.” That is, I think such conversations threaten to tumble into abstractions instead of specifics; which result I find strange, since the specifics of a language are what attract linguists to it.[2] II. Preserving Biological Uniqueness Then I had another thought: What if the uniqueness of a language was more than cultural—what if it was biological? What if the loss of a language didn’t entail the loss of a cultural perspective on the world but a neurolinguistic steady state, one which would not...</span></a></div>
