I&#39;ve taught 6-week classes -- 75 minutes a day, five days a week for a 3-credit course -- and I kind of like it because students are more focused. I&#39;ve taught two sections of the same course, back to back, even.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the 4-week mini-term -- two hours a day for nineteen days, often starting before Spring semester final grades were due -- in which I taught both halves of the World History survey.....</p>

<p>And, before you dismiss the semester system out of hand, remember that some of us teach 4-4 loads, and spring semester is sixteen weeks with no breaks except one week in the middle.</p>

<p>Believe me, I understand toasted.</p></span>

<p>I was talking about the students, not the teachers.  I&#39;m fine teaching in the quarter system, but to be an 18 yr. old kid under this sort of pressure?  Brutal.</p>

<p>Adam,</p>

<p>Were that I were too!  Would making the marking easier, though it would monkey with the grades.</p>

<p>Rich,</p>

<p>I was just thinking the other day, &quot;I wonder where Rich got off to?&quot;  Glad to hear it&#39;s just work and not something that might happen to me.</p></span>

Really heart-warming of you to see things from our perspective.  Let us know when you&#39;re ready to pay back the taxpayers&#39; money.  Oops, wrong channel.

Every time I did, the theme from my favorite childhood cartoon took up residence in my head for hours on end: Watching &quot;Lambert the Sheepish Lion&quot; as an adult made me realize that the reason I always remembered Winnie the Pooh narrating it was because Winnie the Pooh narrated it; more importantly, I learned that my fascination with nature vs. nurture debate started early. I can graft so many elements of that cartoon onto arguments in my dissertation that it makes more sense to say that those arguments were rooted in it. &quot;Lambert&quot; tackles the notion that we essentially are what we are, but can choose to be otherwise. So too does my dissertation. It addresses the fact that superiority is dependent upon environment, and that environment encompasses both the social (the lambs) and natural (the wolf) worlds. So too does my dissertation. I would go on, but I can barely see for all the irony: a cartoon I loved as a child in which the premises of deterministic thought were challenged likely determined the topic of the dissertation I would write as an adult.</span></a></div>

You're welcome to comment on the post here or at The Valve, but I don't want to reproduce it over here and risk confusing the search engines as to the location of the event.</span></a></div>
