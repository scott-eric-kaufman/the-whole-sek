You think now is the really the best time to write about heaving bosoms and all that other Cleland-esque nonsense?&quot; To which I replied, &quot;Yo.&quot; Was I trying to get under my skin? &quot;If you have something to say to me, say it already,&quot; I said. To which I replied, &quot;Yo.&quot; My faux-taciturn resolve was starting to piss me off. I couldn't believe what I was saying. Was I actually dismissing myself with a stern, masculine and monosyllabic &quot;yo&quot;? Had the years of proximity to the John Wayne Memorial Airport finally rubbed off? I had to find out. &quot;Say 'yo' again and see what happens,&quot; I braved. &quot;Yo.&quot; &quot;This is your last chance,&quot; I said as I tried not to over-think my next play. If I moved quickly enough I could blind-side me, but then I asked myself, &quot;Would John Wayne sucker-punch himself?&quot; Then I remembered that I've never seen a John Wayne movie, and that the closest thing I've ever seen to a western is HBO's Deadwood. You can guess what came next. &quot;Say it again, cocksucker.&quot; Then I went beserk. Not me, the other me, the strong silent one, the one who doesn't overthink things. I was all over myself. I kept on swinging until I nearly passed out. I could hear myself mocking me with that calm, collected &quot;yo,&quot; followed by a vicious hook, &quot;yo,&quot; another hook, &quot;yo,&quot; another, &quot;yo.&quot; Next thing I know, I've knocked myself silly. When I finally come to, I look at myself and I realize I wasn't myself at all. I had mistaken me for a Japanese robot designed by Idaku Ishii which can, theoretically, hit a baseball traveling 187 m.ph. &quot;Damn,&quot; I thought I said to myself, but apparently said aloud. &quot;Yo.&quot; Blackness. I hope I recover soon.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/promoting_a_cul.html"><span><strong>Promoting a Culture of Life, Online, Valve-Style (Except Over Here, A. Cephalous-Style, Like Hamster, Only Tougher...)</strong> [Cross-posted over yonder.] Many, many, many people linked to the article in The Chronicle of Higher Education on “Academic Flame Wars.” To my mind, Miriam hits the nail on the head when she says “It’s not clear what we’re supposed to learn from this article. That people are sometimes nasty to each other in online environments? That discussion groups aren’t necessarily warm and cuddly? That spending time online can distract you from other pursuits? I could have sworn that most of us knew these things already.” As a description of the way people relate online, Mr. Mendelsohn’s account is as accurate as any. For those impressed by its profundities, well, you and I should have words about the sky (still up), the seas (still water), food (still edible) and television (still unbearable).* For the rest of you, the real issue in this article is accountability. The first thing you notice when reading it is that its pseudonymous author, Alan Mendelsohn, appears to have played no part in the various skirmishes he describes. He’s an innocent bystander in a violent, hostile (and presumably unmoderated) forum. Perhaps Mr. Mendelsohn really did stand on the sidelines and watch as his department-mates tore into each other. In his account, at least, he isn’t a major player. He’s no tire-iron wieldin’ “Brian” who, “in a bizarre performance...vaulted into the discussion to announce that Dave was ‘the boy who cried racism.’” As the final paragraph makes perfectly clear, he’d like his audience to believe he’s the one who “plaintively” asks “Am I the only who that has papers to write?” (I don’t buy that someone would be moved, at least “a year later,” to write an anonymous column in The Chronicle if he hadn’t a stake in the affair.) He’d participate in these discussions, he’d have us believe, but he’s too busy drafting a criticism of a theoretical trend that you’re bored with the essay by the time it appears in a peer-reviewed journal, but at least you’ve produced something more lasting than a blog-delivered, “You think you’re so sympathetic to the oppressed, Dr. New Historicist, but when it comes to labor activism in the community, you’re a no-show.&quot; I’m circling back to that. When he conflates an official departmental listserv and a blog--&quot;my department’s online discussion group for graduate students, which often doubled as a blog in that students made six- or seven-paragraph comments about various topics&quot;--he makes a category error that his brief mention of McLuhan should’ve warned him away from: different media, different ball-game. An official departmental listserv, comprised of people you meet and interact with on a regular basis, and in which matters are discussed serially but in such a way that previous bits of the conversation are lost in the noise that follow, well, that’s entirely different from a blog in which everyone’s words are right painfully present. They make themselves known by virtue of their permanence. To misconstrue someone’s point is to risk being called out for misconstruing it because...</span></a></div>
