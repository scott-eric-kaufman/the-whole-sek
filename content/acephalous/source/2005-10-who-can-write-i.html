They all resonate. Resonate, I say, RESONATE! That, and there's some implicit lessons to be learned on the importance of bibliophile etiquette buried deep beneath the surface of this entry.] Before I begin working through Foucault to the New Historicists, I have some trivia to share. The copy of Hardt and Negri's Empire from which I'll be quoting has an interesting history. It begins in 2000, the year of its initial publication, when Jim Ziegler (since tenure-tracked somewhere) and I were discussing it in the &quot;TA lounge,&quot; a.k.a. the round table in front of the graduate student mailboxes ... which the faculty use as a short-cut between the main English department office and the primary graduate seminar room. (And why shouldn't they? It's their department.) So Jim and I are idly chatting about Empire when Julia Lupton walks up, pauses, greets us, says something to Jim (I'm deaf, remember?) and then hurries off. (Julia's an important person around UCI—a model academic whose standards I fail daily to live up to—she's always hurrying somewhere, and with good reason.) Point being: Julia and Jim exchange words both assumed I could hear. I couldn't, but as I often do in such situations, I nodded my head and pretended to hear all. So when Jim's email arrived later that afternoon asking me what times worked best for me, I had no clue what he was talking about. I related my schedule. &quot;Perfect,&quot; he responded. &quot;I'll get right on it.&quot; &quot;Get right on it?&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;Get right on what?&quot; Turns out everyone rightly pegged Jim as (but mistook me for) the resident Hardt &amp; Negri expert, and that I was now the co-coordinator of the faculty-dominated Empire reading group. You heard me correctly: a first year, in his second quarter, was assumed expert enough in the Hardt &amp; Negri corpus to lead a faculty-dominated reading group. (In retrospect I realize the faith Julia placed in Jim was well-founded, and her willingness to defer to a graduate student on the topic a sign that she practiced the egalitarianism she preached. But I digress.) So I participated in this reading group with Jim, Julia and a host of imposing faculty members like Mark Poster and Andrzej Warminski. One of the highlights of my first year, I tell you. Time passes. The year is 2005. It is Spring Quarter. I haven't thought about Empire or been all that theoretically inclined for years. I still own the book, mind you, and it still overbrims with my original marginalia. I'm invested in every page. Manic glossing. Attack this point here, cheer-lead that point there. The phone rings. &quot;Hello?&quot; I say, assuming the voice at the other end belongs to a machine which desires nothing more than to clean my carpet, lower my mortgage rates or help me refinance my loans. &quot;Yes, I'm told..." />

<p>Before I begin working through Foucault to the New Historicists, I have some trivia to share.&nbsp; The copy of Hardt and Negri's <em>Empire </em>from which I'll be quoting has an interesting history.&nbsp; It begins in 2000, the year of its initial publication, when Jim Ziegler (since tenure-tracked somewhere) and I were discussing it in the &quot;TA lounge,&quot; a.k.a. the round table in front of the graduate student mailboxes ... which the faculty use as a short-cut between the main English department office and the primary graduate seminar room.&nbsp; (And why shouldn't they?&nbsp; It's their department.)&nbsp; So Jim and I are idly chatting about <em>Empire</em> when <a href="http://www.faculty.uci.edu/scripts/UCIFacultyProfiles/DetailDept.CFM?ID=2787">Julia Lupton</a> walks up, pauses, greets us, says something to Jim (I'm deaf, remember?) and then hurries off.&nbsp; (Julia's an <a href="http://web2.hnet.uci.edu/hot/">important person</a> around UCI—a model academic whose standards I fail daily to live up to—she's always hurrying somewhere, and with good reason.)&nbsp; Point being:</p>

<p>Julia and Jim exchange words both assumed I could hear.&nbsp; I couldn't, but as I often do in such situations, I nodded my head and pretended to hear all.&nbsp; So when Jim's email arrived later that afternoon asking me what times worked best for me, I had no clue what he was talking about.&nbsp; I related my schedule.&nbsp; &quot;Perfect,&quot; he responded.&nbsp; &quot;I'll get right on it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Get right on it?&quot; I thought to myself.&nbsp; &quot;Get right on what?&quot;</p>

<p>Turns out everyone rightly pegged Jim as (but mistook me for) the resident Hardt &amp; Negri expert, and that I was now the co-coordinator of the faculty-dominated <em>Empire </em>reading group.&nbsp; You heard me correctly: a first year, in his second quarter, was assumed expert enough in the Hardt &amp; Negri corpus to lead a faculty-dominated reading group.&nbsp; (In retrospect I realize the faith Julia placed in Jim was well-founded, and her willingness to defer to a graduate student on the topic a sign that she practiced the egalitarianism she preached.&nbsp; But I digress.)&nbsp; So I participated in this reading group with Jim, Julia and a host of imposing faculty members like Mark Poster and Andrzej Warminski.&nbsp; One of the highlights of my first year, I tell you.<br /> </p>

<p><em>Time passes. </em> </p>

<p>The year is 2005.&nbsp; It is Spring Quarter.&nbsp; I haven't thought about <em>Empire </em>or been all that theoretically inclined for years.&nbsp; I still own the book, mind you, and it still overbrims with my original marginalia.&nbsp; I'm invested in every page.&nbsp; Manic glossing.&nbsp; Attack this point here, cheer-lead that point there.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The phone rings.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&quot;Hello?&quot; I say, assuming the voice at the other end belongs to a machine which desires nothing more than to clean my carpet, lower my mortgage rates or help me refinance my loans.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I'm told you have <em>Empire</em>,&quot; the voice says.&nbsp; </p>



<p>&quot;What?&nbsp; I&nbsp; have empire?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;<em>Empire</em>, <em>Empire</em>, Hardt, Negri, <em>Empire</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The book?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can I borrow it?&nbsp; Wait, hold on, you talk to him.&quot;</p>

<p>On the line now is someone who knew I helped organize the <em>Empire </em>reading group.&nbsp; He had tried to contact Jim, but Jim had since fled Irvine for fields criss-crossed by tracks of tenure.&nbsp; So he went to the next name anyone knew.&nbsp; Mine.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&quot;Hi Scott.&nbsp; Spivak needs a copy of a <em>Empire </em>for her class next week and she left hers at home.&nbsp; Can she borrow yours?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure.&nbsp; Why not.&quot;</p>

<p>Later that day, my copy of <em>Empire </em>is hand-delivered to Spivak.</p>

<p><em>Time passes.</em></p>

<p>The quarter ends.&nbsp; I check my mailbox after turning in my grades, and there is my copy of <em>Empire</em>.&nbsp; No note.&nbsp; No nothing.&nbsp; Just the book in the box.&nbsp; I put it in my bag and walk home.&nbsp; When I take it out of my bag, something falls out of it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A postcard.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/where_do_little_books_come_from/#4570">The second strangest thing I've ever found in a book</a>.&nbsp; Written on it is the following:</p><blockquote><p>I need to excuse myself from auditing your class, as I will need to miss tomorrow's class.&nbsp; Which is too much to miss in a four-seek seminar.&nbsp; (I will hopefully catch up next Spring if you're back.)&nbsp; I will, however, attend your lecture the final Friday.</p></blockquote><p>No name.&nbsp; Signed only &quot;With warm thought.&quot;&nbsp; I think that a strange thing to leave in a book you knew would be returned to someone else.&nbsp; I wonder if there's anything else in the book, perhaps something more important, something she'd like returned.&nbsp; Flipping through the pages, I notice unfamiliar handwriting.&nbsp; Check marks.&nbsp; Exclamation points.&nbsp; Things I hadn't written.&nbsp; I start to read this new marginalia.&nbsp; Next to a note of mine on 181 which reads &quot;empire resides in a world constantly calls it into existence&quot; I find a giant checkmark.&nbsp; Next to the more cryptic &quot;Hobbes: sovereignty, transcendence, representation&quot; on 84 appears &quot;What?!?&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>My marginalia has been judged.&nbsp; By Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak.&nbsp; And been found wanting.&nbsp; I flip through the book and find a running dialogue in the margins.&nbsp; She approves of some of comments; is baffled by others; and on occasion scribbles corrections.&nbsp; I realize that my copy of <em>Empire </em>has been glossed.&nbsp; Not merely glossed, but glossed twice over, first by myself, then by Spivak.&nbsp; I wonder whether she responds to Hardt and Negri's texts or my comments.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I wonder what she said in the seminars.&nbsp; I try to reconstruct what she said about <em>Empire </em>in the public lectures which I had attended and which her anonymous correspondent said he would.&nbsp; I wonder if he did.&nbsp; I wonder all of this and realize that I was supposed to finish the two-part series on Foucault and not prattle on and on and on about the books I would use to do so.&nbsp; </p>

		<span id="comment-10184595-content"><p>Hmm, interesting story.  I would guess that at some point you skimmed through the whole book, looking for some remark like &quot;Wrong! Wrong!&quot; or &quot;Brilliant!&quot;, right?</p>

<p>The first similar story that springs to mind for me was from sometime late in the 20th century.  I was working half time freelance, half time for an environmental group, and a (small) part of my job was to squabble with industry at various meetings.  Depending on who you were dealing with, they&#39;d like to try various petty intimidation things -- I remember that at my first-ever one, when I was just getting started as a volunteer activist (and grad student), they sent somebody outside to take down my license plate number during the meeting, and informed me at the end that according to state law I had to have an in-state license plate, and how could I bring up their air pollution when I was breaking laws myself etc etc.</p>

<p>At any rate, I walk into this meeting, and there are the usual row of industry people facing me and, I think, one other enviro.  I don&#39;t even remember why we were there; I&#39;m pretty sure it was some deregulatory issue that an association of chemical manufacturers was trying to negotiate with us about, and my part of it was to not negotiate.  So, just before the meeting starts, one of the industry people starts talking to me, supposedly being interested in what I do.  He pulls out a sheaf of paper and I realize that he&#39;s printed out parts of my Web site.  Seemingly pointless; why print out the front page, which is largely links?  But of course it was for the suggestion that they could track me, which in the days before Google existed was not quite as obvious as it is now, and to make it clear that they had taken the trouble to research me beforehand.  He might have written small, cryptic notes on the paper as well, though of course he only brought out the paper for long enough for me to see what it was.  It didn&#39;t work; I had long since gotten used to things like that.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s nowhere near as good as your story, I realize now that I&#39;ve typed this.  Might as well hit post now though...</p></span>

		<span id="comment-10193399-content"><p>A good friend of mine, a keen-enough deconstructivist (so many of us were, back then) met Derrida at a Cambridge posh do in the early 90s, and she thought it would be a good idea to say &#39;it&#39;s great to be in your <i>presence</i>, sir, yuk-yuk.&#39;  And, without saying anything in reply, he. Slowly. Turned. His. Back. On.  Her.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, she hasn&#39;t had much luck with celebrities.  She once queued for many hours to get her copy of Johnny Rotten&#39;s (as I always still think of him), which is to say <i>John Lydon</i>&#39;s autobiography signed.  When she finally got to the head of the queue she asked him, &#39;hi, can you please write in it, &quot;To Pam, I mean it maaan&quot;?&#39;  And he said, &#39;no.&#39;  Didn&#39;t even sneer it.  Perhaps that&#39;s the punkier thing to do, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Ach, I apologise for unloading weak and, worse, second-hand stories upon you.  Still, as Rich writes above, I might as well press &#39;post&#39; now ...<br />

<p><br />
The Golden Jubilee of John Lydon</p>

<p><br />
When there’s no future, how can there be sin<br />
We are the flowers in the dustbin<br />
Left to compost, turning to mold<br />
Easy innocence is getting old</p>

<p>No more future, we’ve eaten the past<br />
The golden present is here at last<br />
Nostalgia makes our daily bread<br />
All of our music is already dead</p>

<p>The human machine will not stop or slow<br />
No future, we said, that was decades ago<br />
Oh lord God have mercy, all crimes are paid<br />
Now that we live in a world that we made</p></span>

Now that story could get cross-posted to the Valve.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to feel too sympathetic for John Lydon once you&#39;ve watched him on <i>I&#39;m a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!</i>  Which is worth a google if you don&#39;t know it.</p></span>

It&#39;s not a &quot;story.&quot;  It happened.  I considered bringing the digital camera to bear on the book and the postcard before I posted, but decided not to because it involved many wires.

<p>Such things happen to one when teaching literary journalism.  I fear I suffer the fear of disbelief I imbue in my students every quarter...the one which leads them to turn in their final article, a couple of micro-cassettes, three notebooks and a VHS tape of their final interviews with the subjects.

Yes, there are Barnes and Nobles in Irvine, but the culture of Irvine is such that on the eve of Spivak&#39;s public lectures, during which, she&#39;s already announced, she&#39;ll be discussing <i>Empire</i>, there&#39;s no chance there&#39;ll be a copy of <i>Empire</i> at the bookstore.  </p>

<p>Rich, you&#39;ve no reason to question the veracity of <i>my</i> story, since I was also duped by Michael&#39;s.  That said, I still think it&#39;s an account, but that may be because I teach literary journalism, a.k.a. the art of transforming facts into stories without compromising the veracity of the former and the entertainment value of the latter.</p>

<p>T.V., I think you&#39;re the poster boy for &quot;T.V. Quality Accounts of T.V. Quality Perceptions.&quot;  </p></span>

Thus, I present to you my moment in DaDa's sun: no No NO, I was talking about Gangesa, the 14th century Sanskrit philosopher of logic, not Shree Ganesha, elephant-headed son of Shiva and Parvati. However, given Ganesha's association with intellect and wit and the erudite howlers Gangesa works into his Navya-Navya classic Tattvacintamani, I can see why you'd make that mistake. To which Luke rightly replied: I'm sorry Mr. Kaufman (if that is your real name) but this is a no-trolling zone. We're gonna have to ask you to leave. I choose the Elephant randomly. Although if you ask me, I will pretend to know who Ganesha is. Which compelled me to respond: I'm sorry Luke (if that is your real elephant), but I'm the inquisitor here, and I insist that you acknowledge the elephant on the table for what it is: namely, a troll. A porcelain troll, you know, to compliment the decor. It's there. Can't you see it? Why do you deny its existence? What is it with you people who refuse to see! It is right there! On that table! Shree-tapping-dancing-Ganesha! At this point, a complaint about the quality of conversation at The Valve arose. I defended my adopted child as best I could: As for the Valve, being that I'm a contributer there, I must say that I disagree completely with Matt's assessment of it being a &quot;bad blog.&quot; It's no worse than Long Sunday, only ideologically different. For some reason I seem to be the only one who genuinely likes people who contribute to both...except for that [PR], about whom my feelings are well-document (in this very post, no less). I can't see why everyone can't get along, outside of the fact that everyone seems to argue in bad faith. I don't know why they do this, but they do. On the other hand (and this comment's getting damn long, as have a lot of mine lately), there's also the eternal divide between the scholar and the critic, with the Valve people falling on the scholarly side and Long Sunday on the critical...but that's not really accurate, what with Holbo being an analytic philosopher by training; and we all appreciate the same music; seem to like the same books (non-theory division); watch the same movies. We'd be drinking buddies in an off-line life...and yet look at us. But The Mad Thinker foiled my plans: Ah. Scott I see wastes no time in twisting my words. When I said &quot;bad blog&quot; I was speaking in the sort of stern voice one uses when addressing a dog who has just inhaled one's fillet mignon, after you have spent a lifetime researching and cooking it to perfection. In fact I have actually seen this happen once, in a kitchen of a fancy restuarant in which I labored, late at night, and let me tell you the cold hard truth of the matter is:...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/the_dresner_dec.html"><span><strong>The Drezner Decision; or, I Knew It! I Knew It! I Knew It!  Huzzah!</strong> The news that Daniel Drezner has been denied tenure will no doubt be the topic of conversation for days to come. Reactions have ranged from the predictable to the insightful. The predictable will find some way to blame it on the blog: There are a couple of tentative conclusions to draw, I think. One is that it's probably a very bad idea to blog under your own name if you don't have tenure. Chicken Little, unable to see sky for his self-righteous cries, considers the complex situation and draws some characteristically inane conclusions: How come Drezner didn't get tenure? Same questions, same answers, it seems to me. Maybe it was the blog, maybe someone didn't like his sister. In any case, if I were blogging under my own name, expected to pursue an academic career, and didn't have tenure, I would seriously reconsider the blog. It must have been the blog. Since he's as intelligent as he is well-published, the only reasonable explanation of his denial is the blog. Arguments which assume the blog spelled Drezner's doom deny the how dicey departmental politics are. Drezner may be an internet celebrity but an odd bird in his own department. He may be intelligent but, as some of those who comment their consolations acknowledge, the department may be headed in a different direction. Or perhaps he angered one person on his review board. Perhaps something he had said at a faculty luncheon three years past had rubbed a reviewer raw and submarined his chances. Because tenure reviews occur behind locked doors, neither the candidate nor his readers know the details. To claim the blog exacerabated whatever departmental divisions already existed reminds this blogger of the days after Timothy McVeigh took down the Alfred P. Murrah building. Cries of &quot;Islamic fundamentalists!&quot; tore through the media. This repetition comforted all those who needed explanation. When proved patently false, those who had declared that fundamentalists had torn down our sky shut their mouths and dealt with the more complicated reality that an American had attacked Oklahoma City. I raise this issue not to declare these events commensurate, but to ward the demons of false surety from the congenital conjecturers. The demons want your napes yet here you are augering this and that and claiming academic armageddon has arrived. But maybe it was the blog. Perhaps departmental politics do boil down to some anti-blogger bone. I doubt it. Of course I could be wrong. The University of Chicago could publish a statement explaining the Drezner denial declaring that they really wanted to award him tenure but were threatened by the very thought of his blog. Then I would have to step to the plate and acknowledge that despite all the tangible benefits my blog has brought me—the transatlantic emails from scholars I never would have thought interested in my project and the feedback from interested but not formal academic parties—the dissertation improvements don't outweigh the mere fact of blogging. Grant all that. What matters is the...</span></a></div>
