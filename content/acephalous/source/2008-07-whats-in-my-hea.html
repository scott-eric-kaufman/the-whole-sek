		<span id="comment-124793818-content"><p>Through some complicated set of zine orders, my wife got a copy of <i>Bipolar</i>, the alt-comic book in which  was serialized.   was the eventual graphic novel adaptation of Etgar Keret&#39;s short story &quot;Kneller&#39;s Happy Campers,&quot; which was also the source material for <i>Wristcutters</i>. (Woo boy, that&#39;s a lot of dependent clauses.  Glad I broke it into two sentences.)  So by the time I eventually watched the film, I knew the basic premise and arc of the story, and yet was utterly charmed by the adaptation.  I think it&#39;s a quietly wonderful film.</p>

<p>By the way, if you (or others)are looking for a further exploration of Gogol Bordello, I personally recommend &quot;Super Taranta!&quot; over &quot;Gypsy Punks&quot; as a place to start.</p></span>

The New York Times hands conservatives a dreydl: “Look!” one shouts, “Obama’s socialism is evident in every question!” “Actually,” another says, “it seems to me that the bottom line is not the questions he asked, but how he evaluated the answers. He asks for strengths and weaknesses of different possible positions in regard to gay marriage. That’s actually (both pedagogically and philosophically) a pretty fair way of testing. It not only gets at the student’s views, but also his ability to argue the question. But–” “But what?” “–but am I paranoid, or just appropriately suspicious, of the care he took to avoid taking positions, not publishing, questioning but not answering?” “Exactly!” they enthuse. “Come play now let’s begin!” The dreydl bounces on the formica and settles into a smooth spin. “GIMMEL GIMMEL GIMMEL GIMMEL GIMMEL!” they shout. Gimmel it is. “GANTZ!” The entire pot is theirs. They can on-the-one-hand this: There’s little for someone hoping to exploit an image of Obama as any kind of radical academic: His responses are two-sided, finely balanced, sober. He seems the typical disinterested law prof to me, perhaps worthy of congratulations for keeping his aloofness intact, despite an incendiary subject matter. And on-the-same-hand as this: [C]onsulting his own answer sheet, Lecturer Obama seems a lot like Candidate Obama, saying he has no right answer and not volunteering his own opinion. Had the dreydl not been loaded — had they spun a nun — they still would’ve won the pot. If Obama had presented himself as a “radical academic” or evidenced an itch to indoctrinate, it would’ve been proof of Secret Socialism. All evidence aside, it would’ve confirmed his status as the most liberal Senator Congressperson in the history of America. So because Obama took his position as a teacher seriously and graded with respect to the quality of instead of the ideology behind an argument; because he kept his personal politics out of the classroom, as these very same conservatives so adamantly desire; because Obama’s behavior accorded with their ethical standards, he shouldn’t be trusted. That there’s no conceivable scenario in which Travis Kavulla and his ilk would deem Obama trustworthy doesn’t mean his argument is intellectually dishonest. Wait a minute now — it does. Tendentious arguments are intellectually dishonest. Whatever. Ante up already! Who knows? Maybe this time they’ll spin shin!</span></a></div>

On this day in 1927, a man whose Wikipedia entry was edited, via cell, from Minute Maid Park in the home half of the seventh was born. Television crews didn’t capture the edit, but they did capture the man himself as he waved feebly to the crowd of 38,602 baseball fans who applauded the infamous V-J Day celebrant on the occasion of his 81st birthday. How do I know? I was there. As luck would have it, not only was I there, I was seated next to a blogger. You’d think this was planned — Scott leaves house, “accidentally” meets blogger, bores wife with insider baseball for hours — but it wasn’t. Honest. But I digress. The octogenarian in question, Glenn McDuffie, has convinced forensic artists and lie detectors he should remembered as the sailor who stopped to kiss a stranger on his way to his girlfriend’s apartment.* How his girlfriend, Ardith Bloomfield of 555 Crown Street felt about his iconic act of infidelity isn’t only lost to history, but McDuffie too: he went to sea and never saw her again.** McDuffie’s not the only person to claim the mantle of Great American Osculator. He’s not even named as a potential candidate in the Life’s 1980 attempt to ferret the identities of the infamous kisser and kissee. When you think about it, it’s only fitting he celebrated his birthday at major sporting event, since major sporting events celebrate kissing for a minute or two every game.*** His kiss, however, has the benefit of inadvertant artfullness: Eisenstaedt’s photo is a perfect Renaissance perspective, with the foreground directly on the lower part of the bowtie, with big buildings converging diagonally toward the vanishing point, and a giant sign with a paternal figure promoting Ruppert Beer right on the point. This sailor and this nurse are surrounded by big buildings, by silver trolley tracks, by neon signs, and by the sky, but also by an assortment of other people. About twenty feet away there is a second sailor (and, in some croppings, a third), smiling on the couple. Another comment is suggested by the huge neon sign just to their right, which advertises BOND, then America’s biggest ready-made clothing store [...] The sign that proclaims the bond between this primal couple also highlights the more complex bonds that hold together the city, the country, maybe even the world. The other people in the picture are participants in the crowd’s festivities, but also, like ourselves, spectators of the couple’s embrace. They are both wearing uniforms, which mark them as “public servants” and separate them from the multitude of civilians (like ourselves) who surround them and whom they serve. His uniform is black, hers white. The contrast between them, sharpened by black-and-white film, heightens the clinch that binds them together. And the man responsible for this quintessential American photograph? A German Jewish refugee named Alfred Eisenstaedt whose previous claim to fame was a portrait of Goebbels the Nazi Propaganda Minister only found unflattering after...</span></a></div>
