		<span id="comment-101311856-content"><p>If it helps at all, pretty much everyone who&#39;s ever been a law student knows who Spencer is, because there&#39;s a famous Supreme Court case in which Oliver Wendall Holmes declaims &quot;The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer&#39;s social statics.&quot;  At which all the students go what the hell is a social static and who&#39;s Spencer, and the prof says &quot;social Darwinism,&quot; so maybe this isn&#39;t a great example in terms of making you feel better, but he does live on in this one surprisingly-derogatory (surprising because I think OWH was amenable to Spencerian thought) reference.</p></span>

<p>Pedant.  Don&#39;t you realize that you&#39;re hanging with a privileged crowd when a significant number of folks even know a hint about who Edmund Spenser was?  How many people apart from Tolkien fans have any clue about the <i>Faerie Queen</i>? ;)</p>

<p>What&#39;s amazing about Herbert is how he&#39;s kind of gotten off scott free.  I mean, people keep accusing Darwin of the ideas that were really lousy Spencerian extensions of Darwin.  But perhaps I&#39;m reciting the sophomoric view of Spencer?</p>

<p>I think he wasn&#39;t quite dead at the point these articles were written. I think this was a Connor Macleod-like situation where he poses as a child or grandchild of himself after disappearing for a few years at a time. At one point he was a poet, then a social theorist. I think it isn&#39;t too great a leap. </p>

<p>This illness was simply another ruse, so that he slip away, let the whole thing blow over, and then re-emerge 90+ years later having adopted the name of John, only to start a Blues Explosion. </p></span>

<p>Spencer is well known to George Eliot people, of course, not just for his intellectual influence but for rebuffing her romantically. When I tell the story to my classes I quote his dismissive remark that &quot;the lack of physical attraction was fatal&quot; and then (in the spirit of meeting one cheap shot with another!) put up a good head shot of the great man.... On the bright side, if he&#39;d been able to appreciate her, we might never have had Middlemarch, so in the end it&#39;s all for the best.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-129907956-content"><p>I was just reading about something connected to this last night.  Maybe it&#39;s an answer to your WTF about the NYT article about Spencer&#39;s bad day.  It&#39;s from &quot;William James: In the Maelstrom of Modernism&quot; by Robert D. Richardson (p.443).  &quot;In December Herbert Spencer died, and James -- in luck for once -- furnished the New York Post with a long piece on Spencer he had written nine or ten years earlier, when Spencer was thought to be dying.&quot;</p>

<p>I figure that Spencer wasn&#39;t the Britney Spears of his day.  Instead, he was the Generalissimo Francisco Franco, whose protracted death was played for yucks for weeks on SNL back in the day.</p></span>

The accusations that anyone who supports Obama has &quot;drunk the Kool-Aid.&quot; Clinton supporters insist that the only reasons anyone would support Obama are 1) unconscious sexism or 2) Kool-Aid intoxication. At Kugelmass's place, I forestalled the first complaint with all the wit and subtlety of an enraged moose. Me and my ten-foot pole will avoid that one from here on out. As to the other charge, I'm convinced that people who claim Obama's supporters have drunk his Kool-Aid are the same people who failed my freshmen composition course lo all those years ago. Consider the complaints aired in this thread at The Left Coaster. Here is Joe (7:03 AM): If you cared about civil rights and health care you would find Hillary Rodham Clinton inspiring. To say you find Barrack Hussein Obama’s empty rhetoric inspiring says as much about the shallowness of the listener than the speaker. I saw a stat yesterday about how 60% of Hussein Obama's supporters would not vote democratic if he wasn't on the ticket, and it explained why so many are so baseless ... ... they voted republican in 2000 &amp; 2004. Besides adopting the other party's talking points, Joe delivers that most egregious of undergraduate composition errors: He mistakes the use of rhetoric per se for the effective use of rhetoric. Anyone who's ever taught composition has bored you with stories about students whose &quot;argument&quot; is &quot;In this essay the author uses rhetoric to influence people.&quot; Of course people use rhetoric. Not an issue. Instructors want to know whether that rhetoric is effective or not. Students want to point out that rhetoric is there and is being used ... and that therefore and thereby and thusly the person using it is lying because rhetoric is trickery and if this person was really honest no trickery would be needed to convince us that this person is correct in all things always and forever. I kid you not. This is what undergraduates think. Did I write &quot;undergraduates&quot;? Because I need to expand that a bit. Witness the protestations of &quot;iamcoyete&quot;: I'm not one of those that need inspiration, but I understand that the masses need their opiates. The original Pet Rock sold millions. I didn't buy one of those either. But since I want a dem to win, I hope the fad lasts to November. And before anyone yells &quot;sour grapes,&quot; let me just say that I never expected Clinton to win; there's just too much animosity out there, especially in the media, who, ironically enough, has pretty much chosen your candidate for you, despite all the protestations of &quot;I don't want the media choosing my candidate!&quot; Sure, I hoped, and even though Hope is now officially considered a plan, my personal hope was always unfounded considering the sheer volume of loathing the Clintons now &quot;inspire&quot; in the same people who spent 7 years defending them. No, my disgust comes from the realization that I was stupid enough...</span></a></div>
