According to the prelude to “American Writing Today: A Symposium,”
Crain’s article addresses “the conditions of production of new

The article’s evident confusion&nbsp; may be the product of Crain (or the <em>n+1</em>
editors) deciding that “Academic Criticism” signals some particular
body of work with addressable conditions of production, characters and
traits, &amp;c.&nbsp; It obviously does, only Crain doesn’t address <em>that</em>.&nbsp; He reduces it to the small and vanishing genre of single-author studies.&nbsp; To wit:

shows.&nbsp; [Even <em>more</em> evidence of fandom.] I have listened to

them because they are, after all, his.&nbsp; [<em>Even more</em>.] I have

<p>Crain describes a very particular—already tenured or likely
untenurable—breed of “academic critic” as representative.&nbsp; Very few
academics truly and uncritically <em>love</em> the work of the writers
they study.&nbsp; (I, for one, am frequently astonished I worked through
almost all of Jack London or Silas Weir Mitchell.) There are
exceptions, and they have socities, edit coterie journals and hold
yearly conferences; but they by no means dominate the field, and they
are often considered too <em>indulgent</em> to take seriously.&nbsp; (The jealousy?&nbsp; <em>Palpable.</em>)&nbsp; But how many single-author studies were published last year?&nbsp; How many single-author dissertations written?&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>
A chapter or an article may <em>appear</em> to be the product of an
uncritical crush, in that it quotes letters, journal entries, and in
the case of a Marianne Moore article I misplaced, grocery lists—if
you’ve read Moore, you know their potential relevance—but it’s
uncritical for reasons unrelated to why a Pogues fan struggles to
appreciate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nipple_Erectors">the Nipple Erectors</a>.&nbsp; (Not <em>that</em> much of a struggle, actually.)&nbsp; The uncritical fanboy has no intellectual investment in the fanboy “facts” he acquires.&nbsp; The <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/03/its_savory_scho.html">scholar-squirrel</a> acquires those facts <em>for a reason</em>.&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>
Crain’s analog lacks a certain, I don’t know, analogousness.&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>
But it does reveal why I find the piece so problematic.&nbsp; Crain believes
appreciation the purpose of criticism, and that we do too, if only
secretly:
</p>

<blockquote><p>I don’t see anything wrong with fandom.&nbsp; However, I
could only call it a science in jest, and I don’t think I would ever
become so confused as to think of it as morally worthy.&nbsp; Yet such
claims were made for the academic study of literature in the course of
the 20th century.&nbsp; <em>To be sure, they were made after its origin in fandom was disgused by abstraction.</em> (77)</p></blockquote>

<p>
<em>There</em> it is.&nbsp; Crain believes that literary professionals know
that their true function is to teach “refinements in love” and help
readers “meet new lovers” (<em>ibid.</em>).&nbsp; So to speak.&nbsp; We defraud
with flatulent abstraction because we know “literature has nothing to
do with science; it is a matter of taste” (<em>ibid.</em>).&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>
I know Crain earned <a href="http://steamthing.typepad.com/about.html">a Ph.D. from Columbia</a>, and I’ve looked over the essays linked to from that page, so I <em>know</em> he knows that, as currently constituted, literature departments do not <em>fail</em> to cultivate taste so much as <em>not consider it part of the charter</em>. 
I think Crain confuses the purpose of the profession with the reasons
people enter it.&nbsp; An undergraduate who loves to read becomes an English
major, goes to graduate school and emerges someone with mastery of over
a particular body of knowledge which he or she then applies (sometimes)
to literature, the love of which compelled them to become an English
major.&nbsp; </p>

<p>
Even if I grant him the veracity of this account, his argument still
stumbles over the fact that it is founded on innuendo.&nbsp; We all <em>secretly</em>
want advanced degrees in Refinement and Cultivation Studies, but if we
acknowledge that, the game will be up: “It’s not at all clear to me
that the propogation of a taste for [literature] needs to be federally
subsidized” (78).&nbsp; </p>

<p>
That’s not clear to me, either; but then again, since that’s <em>not what actually happens in English departments</em> I don’t see it as a pressing concern.

		<span id="comment-17251828-content"><p>A really excellent post. I love those pretentious, wannabe Paris Review, faux Egoist literary mags like n+1 or The Believer.  But as pleasurable as it is reading such magazines, there are certain traps that befall first person journalists (and bloggers, like myself)--mainly that solipsism that compels them (us) to extract from every personal experience or a ha! moment some Universal Truth.  Wouldn&#39;t I love to connect my eclectism in music taste to my adhoc approach to anti-discrimination law to my love of both colonial and post-colonial literature and form a oxymoronic Unified Theory of Dilettantism.  But somehow, I don&#39;t think there is one...maybe some questions are best left unexplained by superficial and untenable theories.</p>

<p>Then again, the people least able to avoid making weird analogies are lawyers and literary critics. We&#39;re more alike than you think. I think I just offended a whole bunch of people on both sides.</p></span>

Scott: I do. (Assistant District Attorney John Wells strides forward and begins to question Kaufman.) Wells: Is it true that on the tenth of May you wrote a post on your blog called &quot;What's the Word I'm Looking For? The Opposite of 'Disgruntled'&quot;? Scott: I did. Wells: And did said post contain the sentence &quot;Today, for some apparent reason, I had my first choate idea in weeks&quot;? Scott: It did. Wells: Now refer to Government's Exhibit 643. Read the highlighted section. Scott: &quot;But then, all at once, for some apparent reason, she looked in my direction and smiled in a way that I could make heads and tails of.&quot; Wells: Notice any similarity? Scott: The phrase &quot;some apparent reason&quot; appears in both. Wells: It certainly does. Now could you read the next highlighted part? Scott: &quot;The conversation become more and more choate, and we spoke at length to much avail.&quot; I know what you're thinking, but I'm no plagiarist! Wells: Will the court please instruct Mr. Kaufman to only answer the questions asked? Judge: Consider yourself warned. Wells: Thank you. Now please read the rest of the highlighted words. Scott: Gruntled, nomer, shevelled, kempt, godly. Wells: If I were to tell you all those words appeared in your blog post of 10 May, would I be correct? Scott: They're all there, but . . . Wells: You'll answer the questions I ask with a simple &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No.&quot; Scott: Yes. Wells: The State enters Exhibit 644 into evidence. (hands an oddly shaped box to Scott) Mr. Kaufman, will you please tell the jury what you have in your hands? Scott: A copy of The Complete New Yorker. Wells: What would happen if I handed you a laptop and asked you to do a search for an article in the 25 July 1994 issue written be a man named Jack Winter? Scott: Nothing. Wells: Nothing? Scott: I stare at its outrageously complicated search interface for a couple of minutes. Then I'd type in his name and be taken to a screen which listed the articles he'd written. I'd try to access them, but would fail miserably. Wells: And why would you do that? Scott: Because it's designed so counterintuitive that you need a doctorate in Computer Science to navigate it. Wells: You want this court to believe that someone as technological proficient as you is unable to operate The Complete New Yorker's search function? Scott: It's true. Wells: (looking flustered) So what you expect this court to believe is that despite you teaching articles from The New Yorker on a regular basis, you had no idea of the existence of Jack Winter's &quot;How I Met My Wife&quot;? Scott: Yes sir. Wells: And that the numerous identical &quot;words&quot; in the two text appear through sheer coincidence? Scott: Not by coincidence. We—Mr. Winter and I—were both aiming for the same effect. There aren't...</span></a></div>
