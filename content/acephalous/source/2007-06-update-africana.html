		<span id="comment-72773910-content"><p>Well, there&#39;s some hidden context in that SEK seems to imply that the identity of the writer will allow a parsing sympathetic to his cause.  I take it as a matter of faith, but, well, it&#39;ll be nice when the author speaks in her own name.  That&#39;s just consistent with SEK&#39;s comments on speaking in name versus anonymously.</p>

<p>Still, that caveat notwithstanding, this was just almost funny enough to justify the whole sordid affair.  At least I hope so.  Hang in there, SEK.</p></span>

I told myself I would not repost the story—recounted almost word-for-word—unless he repeated it again tonight. Well ... So Carlos bought a monkey. He brought it down and let everyone see it. Everyone loved the monkey. When he got back to Puerto Rico he talked his famous neighbor Chi Chi into getting a monkey too. Being a serious and studious man, Carlos read all he could about monkeys. He learned that they live to be 45 years old. He thought &quot;That's quite a commitment to make to a monkey.&quot; So when he got back to the States he sold the monkey. This isn't a children's story, kids. He sold the monkey.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/apologies_gifts.html"><span><strong>Apologies &amp; Gifts </strong> I currently have 1,271 emails in my inbox. This is a problem. Cranes have been hired. Expect replies shortly. So long as I'm apologizing, I wonder if anyone knows how to convert a song ripped in iTunes into an .mp3. After I lost my hard copy of Leonard Cohen's Songs of Love and Hate—his best, by far—I downloaded it through iTunes ... which means I can't import it into my newly purchased generic .mp3 player. Now, neither my original rips nor the iTunes files work, and damn it, if I can't listen to it, I'm living for nothing now, and am keeping, no kinds of records. I also misconverted all my episodes of In Our Times, so if you have any about and some bandwidth to spare, I'd love to reconnect with my collection. If I can't learn about epistolary novels most immediately, I'll ensconce myself in that cupboard until Mr. B. uses wiles to release me. Gifts: Leonard Cohen, Master Song, So Long Marianne, Stranger Song.</span></a></div>
