<p>To counter recent accusations of <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/29/brain-damaged-historians/#comment-16197">poetry</a> and <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/29/ticked-offhist/#comment-16174">overcompensation</a>, an example of what the inmates write when the guards clock out:</p><blockquote><p>[In the chapters to follow,] I will demonstrate the pervasive influence of these non-Darwinian theories of evolution on late 19th and early 20th Century American literature, paying particular attention to how the haphazard traffic of scientific ideas in intellectual circles alters our understanding of theories of romance, realism, and naturalism.</p>


<p>To build on the traffic metaphor, picture an account of these three novelistic modes as an interstate traveling in two directions: north represents a progressive commitment to social betterment through science, south a conservative commitment to the agrarian ideals of the early Republic.&nbsp; In the conventional account, realism and naturalism occupy the northbound lanes, romance the southbound.&nbsp; The realists responsibly drive Honda Accords north, five miles per hour below the posted speed limit; the naturalists muscle Ford Mustangs between them—one hand on the wheel, the other on the stereo—thirty miles per hour above the limit; while the romancers, they plod south, in aggressively polished Bentleys, driven by the help.&nbsp; The forced homogeneity is meant to be instructive: not all Japanese cars are Hondas, nor are they all driven impeccably; not all American cars Fords, nor do they all careen by whim of inattentive hand; and not all European cars Bentleys, nor are they all piloted with soft disgust by the help. </p>

<p>But my metaphor's limitations parallel those of the conventional account, inasmuch as both betray an underdeveloped appreciation for detail and an overweening urge to categorize.&nbsp; A more accurate metaphor of the cultural scene, circa 1900, would have all three modes traveling north, as all three are equally committed—albeit distinctively, as will be demonstrated in the chapters to follow—to a broad conception of social development via applied science.&nbsp; In this account, self-proclaimed realists sport makes and models from across Japan and Southeast Asia: a Honda Civic jockeys with a Toyota Tundra for inside position until a naturalist in a Pontiac Grand Prix emerges from the shadow of a Chevy Silverado and cuts the corner and secures the lane occupied by a southbound-facing romancer in Rolls Royce who slams into reverse and proceeds north, backwards, as best he can. </p>

<p>This final image—a menagerie of law-abiding Southeast Asian imports hurtling north alongside masculine American machines as both dodge Old World status symbols whose terrified drivers mistakenly believe everyone else wildfires north in the southbound lane—this final, chaotic image closely approximates the bounded diversity of turn-of-the-last-century American culture.&nbsp; Generalizations remain, certainly, but unlike the conventional account, they exist in a manner suitable to and for further differentiation.&nbsp; All Japanese and Southeast Asian cars are not Accords or even Hondas, nor are all American cars Fords, and so on.&nbsp; Moreover, while the driver of a speeding American SUV shares some beliefs and dispositions with the cautious driver of a American coupe, he may share other, more important ones with the driver of a Rolls Royce convertible: the drivers of the coupe and the convertible may be headed for the same exit; the driver of the convertible may share an entrance with the SUV; the driver of the SUV may share an exit with the with the driver of the coupe; or the driver of convertible may be cuckolding the driver of the SUV.&nbsp; Point being, any or all of these distinctions may be critical to understanding their choice of vehicle, preferred entrance and exit, and behavior on the road; shouldering them into a model whose perceptual threshold cannot account for idiosyncratic decisions and behaviors will produce results which say more about the model builder than the thing being modeled. </p>

<p>Although some generalizations still obtain in my account, I embrace the inevitable jams, accidents, pile-ups, and rubbernecking, because the alternative—excluding historical contingency for the sake of conceptual clarity—insisting a southbound <em>facing</em> car is a southbound <em>traveling</em> car—entails the unnecessarily imposition of contemporary norms on a period best characterized by the deliberative nonsense of its maximal diversity.</p></blockquote><p>To enumerate every the sin committed above would be demoralizing, but five grievous ones bear mention:</p>

<ol><li>The metaphor does not explicate a complex matter so much as muddle one with additional complexity.</li>

<li>The idea is too apparent in the execution.&nbsp; I literalized the metaphorical traffic of intellectual exchange because the final image—a southbound facing car traveling north in reverse—struck me as a compelling analogue for the hypocritical claims of historical romancers.&nbsp; </li>

<li>The passage is <a href="http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2008/07/passion-of-manohla-dargis.html">overwrought</a>.&nbsp; Who allowed me unfettered access to semicolons and em dashes?&nbsp; Why does he still work here?</li>

<li>Cars?&nbsp; Seriously?</li>

<li>I mean for <em>seriously </em>seriously?</li></ol>



<p>My complaints notwithstanding, I still believe in this passage for the simple reason that the image in my head <em>works</em>: it organizes numerous (often conflicting) theories of literary tradition and historical causation into something I can easily manipulate in my head.&nbsp; (Plus I can mentally forward 5:10.20 seconds into <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVSRXU0dZR8">this clip</a> and Be The Dissertation I Want To Write.)&nbsp; As written, however, it seems deliberately designed to confuse. This is a problem a better writer might know how to solve, but who has time to consult better writers when his dissertation is due in a little more than a month?&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Maybe I just lack <a href="http://academiccog.blogspot.com/2008/07/how-to-cook-dissertation.html">the right ingredients</a>?&nbsp; </p>

Somewhere in Silas Weir Mitchell's voluminous correspondence on the brain damage of Civil War veterans—my notes are in California, I'm now in Texas—is an account of a Confederate soldier whose bullet-struck head recoiled into a dry-stone wall and performed a fortuitous auto-trepanation. The insult to his brain had been mitigated by the hole in head, but Mitchell feared the soldier would never regain normal cognitive function. As time tripped over nothing, cursed in tongues, begged passersby for aid and, roundly rebuffed, stumbled on, the soldier slowly found himself again. Eventually he could move, see, speak, form new memories and remember the old ones. He was as he'd been before the war, but for the brutal fact he saw in still life: The dog is across the room curled before the fire. Blink. The dog is on its hind legs staring out the window. Blink. The dog is in the middle of the room facing him. Blink. The dog is sinking its wet nose into the crook of his arm. Blink. The dog is across the room curled before the fire. The soldier suffered what we now call akinetopsia or motion blindess.* The effect represented by crude blinks above is better, if more crudely, represented about 5 minutes and 14 seconds into this clip, which captures the fear and paranoia Mitchell assumed would accompany akinetopsia. Items like fans would be particularly disturbing because they produced a constant impression upon the skin by a process undetectable to the patient, for whom the blades would jump—jump—jump instead of spinning. But Mitchell was less concerned with akinetopsia itself than one of its side-effects: the ghostly motion trails produced by items in motion. Stand before a motion-blind person, do a jumping jack, and he will describe two scenes: a first in which your arms are at your sides, and a second in which your arms stand solid above your head, but are followed by a faint trace of the space they traveled, like the long exposure photograph on the right (original) only far less pronounced. Mitchell believed these traces might be related to what would have been his crowning achievement were it not for Charlotte Perkins Gilman: phantom limb syndrome. Normal brains need not speculate as to how your arm moved from Point A to Point B because it registered Points A.001 up through A.999; that is, it receives sequential sense impressions of your arm as it travels from hips to head.** A motion-blind brain only receives sensory impressions from Points A and B, but because it knows arms must move through space, it compensates for what it can't perceive by drawing diaphanous snow-angels in the air. It does so, Mitchell believed, because even damaged brains know how they ought to behave. They know what stimuli they should be receiving and, in their absence, choose to receive them anyway. For Mitchell, the brain is but a forlorn lover refusing to acknowledge its loss: lop off an arm at the elbow and it will insist...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/07/is-it-hannukah.html"><span><strong>Is it Hannukah (Obammukah?) already?</strong> (x-posted.) The New York Times hands conservatives a dreydl: “Look!” one shouts, “Obama’s socialism is evident in every question!” “Actually,” another says, “it seems to me that the bottom line is not the questions he asked, but how he evaluated the answers. He asks for strengths and weaknesses of different possible positions in regard to gay marriage. That’s actually (both pedagogically and philosophically) a pretty fair way of testing. It not only gets at the student’s views, but also his ability to argue the question. But–” “But what?” “–but am I paranoid, or just appropriately suspicious, of the care he took to avoid taking positions, not publishing, questioning but not answering?” “Exactly!” they enthuse. “Come play now let’s begin!” The dreydl bounces on the formica and settles into a smooth spin. “GIMMEL GIMMEL GIMMEL GIMMEL GIMMEL!” they shout. Gimmel it is. “GANTZ!” The entire pot is theirs. They can on-the-one-hand this: There’s little for someone hoping to exploit an image of Obama as any kind of radical academic: His responses are two-sided, finely balanced, sober. He seems the typical disinterested law prof to me, perhaps worthy of congratulations for keeping his aloofness intact, despite an incendiary subject matter. And on-the-same-hand as this: [C]onsulting his own answer sheet, Lecturer Obama seems a lot like Candidate Obama, saying he has no right answer and not volunteering his own opinion. Had the dreydl not been loaded — had they spun a nun — they still would’ve won the pot. If Obama had presented himself as a “radical academic” or evidenced an itch to indoctrinate, it would’ve been proof of Secret Socialism. All evidence aside, it would’ve confirmed his status as the most liberal Senator Congressperson in the history of America. So because Obama took his position as a teacher seriously and graded with respect to the quality of instead of the ideology behind an argument; because he kept his personal politics out of the classroom, as these very same conservatives so adamantly desire; because Obama’s behavior accorded with their ethical standards, he shouldn’t be trusted. That there’s no conceivable scenario in which Travis Kavulla and his ilk would deem Obama trustworthy doesn’t mean his argument is intellectually dishonest. Wait a minute now — it does. Tendentious arguments are intellectually dishonest. Whatever. Ante up already! Who knows? Maybe this time they’ll spin shin!</span></a></div>
