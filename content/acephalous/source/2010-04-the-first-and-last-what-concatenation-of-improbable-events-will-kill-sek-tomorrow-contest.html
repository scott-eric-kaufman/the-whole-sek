		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0134803bcfff970c-content"><p>In an effort to fix the state&#39;s severe budget problems, the lawmakers of California criminalize all unpaid library fines.  Not only do you (unknowingly, of course) still have thousands of dollars in fees accidentally paid to the wrong university department, but Jonah Goldberg has stolen a copy of your library card and used it to check out thousands of books for his sequel to <i>Liberal Fascism</i>, thereby simultaneously a) proving you wrong about his poor research skills and b) bankrupting you in the process.  The police are tipped off about your (now illegal) fines and you are pulled over during your drive to work.  You try to explain that you&#39;re not a criminal but your inability to breath makes them suspicious.  They search your car, discover the cat litter, and assume the worst.  You are arrested, and legions of conservative bloggers and trolls assume that they are vindicated.  You get out on bail, but are fired from your job.  You go to clean out your office only to discover two undergraduates having sex.  You try to get them to leave but they correctly inform you that this is no longer your office and you have no authority over them.  Frustrated but without recourse, you exit the building but get stuck in the elevator for over 72 hours.  Everyone assumes you&#39;ve jumped bail.  You are eventually rescued by Batman, who understands your plight as an outlaw and suggests teaming up with him as a masked vigilante. You accept, but on your way out the building your cold prevents you from running very fast without blacking out.  Batman leaves you behind, deeply ashamed of you.</p>

<p>You are then struck by a random vehicle and killed.</p></span>

As always, his first stop is his own blog where he hopes to read humorous stories predicting his own demise.  His hopes are more than satisfied, as some of the stories are devilishly clever.  SEK begins a comment in response to one of the cleverest stories and, as he revels in its morbid details, begins to laugh.  Unfortunately, this is more than his compromised respiratory system can take and within three guffaws SEK is dead.  His final comment reads, &quot;I hope that I am a coward so that I cannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn&quot;</p></span>

<p>[You can skip down to the [new verses] tag to read only the new material at the end if you like.  The last old verse now has the pessimistic ending.  Of course!]</p>

<p>[Begin chorus]</p>

<p>They tell of a man from Californiay<br />
Who thought that his diss would be done some day <br />
The Devil looked up, said &quot;I&#39;ll make him pay&quot;<br />
So drink one for the troubles of SEK</p>

<p>[end chorus]</p>

<p>Now SEK&#39;s list of trials is long<br />
And we&#39;ll see who&#39;s still standing after this song <br />
He was beat up in high school, he didn&#39;t belong <br />
But it was in grad school that things went wrong</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>And when his thesis had just begun<br />
He turned against Theory, said that wasn&#39;t fun<br />
The New Historicism is the one<br />
He&#39;s stuck reading and re-reading Jack London</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>The doctor told him about his thyroid<br />
He didn&#39;t want his wife to be annoyed<br />
&quot;If I hide it from everyone I&#39;ll stay employed&quot;<br />
So four months of concealment he enjoyed</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>Now SEK came to his office door<br />
And found two students going at it on the floor <br />
&quot;This will make a good story&quot; he thought before <br />
The Sexual Harassment Office sent letters galore</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>And when he was down, and his thoughts were thick <br />
His gloom was interrupted by Honda Civic <br />
The car slammed into him and was gone in a lick <br />
At least six months of rehab went by quick</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>But the most annoying were Internet trolls <br />
Threats of bodily harm will take their toll <br />
They sent letters to his boss, and to every soul <br />
They could find in the whole county&#39;s Email roll</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>He got pictures of the husband of his friend<br />
Having sex with a horde; he thought that was the end<br />
Should he tell her? He went and hit &quot;send&quot;<br />
Now he can&#39;t go home, or with thugs he&#39;ll contend</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>After all those troubles, he still wasn&#39;t drowned <br />
Well, it was absurd, but this might be the crown <br />
Overpayment of library fines will bring him down <br />
He&#39;s no longer a student, just a proper noun</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>He told us all this when he started a blog <br />
And how fate or the Devil made him jump like a frog <br />
The hiring committee looked on agog <br />
If we hire him -- then our luck will fog </p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>[new verses]</p>

<p>The Devil looked up and laughed and laughed<br />
The diss was done, SEK was on staff<br />
His appointment wasn&#39;t tenure track<br />
He&#39;d be lecturing freshman till Hell and back</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>The Devil liked what he did see<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll make SEK live eternally&quot;<br />
He&#39;ll crush people&#39;s souls, and turn them to me<br />
Academics will cry as I laugh with glee</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>When the Devil&#39;s plans caught up the poor sod<br />
That brought the eye of an angry God<br />
Volcanoes and plagues came down in turn<br />
To stop the Devil, SEK must burn</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>He looked at his smoldering car in despair<br />
SEK looked up, shook his fist in the air<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve survived again, and as you can see&quot;<br />
&quot;There&#39;s nothing more you can do to me&quot;</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>As he raised his arm with a defiant shout<br />
A massive lightning bolt snuffed him out<br />
The electric charge was so whole-hog<br />
A freak power surge erased his blog</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>And that was the end of SEK<br />
To his memory we drink today<br />
Lest we get his luck, and get squashed like a bug<br />
The rest of the bottle we now will chug</p></span>

Since age 5, Scott has been deaf.  When he was in college it was so bad he had to get hearing aids that were the first digital.  Now Scott had been ahead of the game for so long he thought he really did not need them. So &quot;new&quot; unused aids can be found in his room, by his bed, just incase while asleep he would need them.  Now, I could be wrong, but hit by a car!  If he heard it he might have been able to prevent the hit. Oh, and when he had a discussion with his wife, while she was upset with him, he could not hear her due to the fact that she was in the bedroom with his hearing aids in there with her.  So,  Scott will lose he place here on earth for the simple reason of saving the hearing aids safe until he really, really needs them.</p></span>

As 5 or more drinks as the threshold for binge drinking, the Irish Times hails our success in binge drinking. But wait. Binge drinking is 5 or more drinks. It's true we lead Europe in the category of very precise binge drinking, i.e. 5 or 6. But you have to look at all consumption over 5 drinks. For Ireland there's another 5% who have 7-9, and 2% who have 10 or more. Total percentage of bingers: 19+5+2=26%. For the UK: 12% have 5-6, and 6% have 7-9, 6% have 10 or more. So 12+6+6=24% are binge drinkers. I spent more than a few evenings in London stunned stupid by the prodigious quantities of alcohol everyone around me was consuming. I'm not simply talking about London toughs either, but professional men and women who stepped in the pub on their way home from work intent on crawling out of it seven hours later stained and debased. If their infamous reserve is roughly equivalent to the Freudian superego, I would say that it performs its role quite admirably until the moment it inexplicably abdicates its responsibilities and allows the id to do what it will. And will it ever. The abuse that streams from their formerly stiff upper lips is more foul than anything this side of Deadwood. That polite archeology student in the hipster sailor suit you were talking to ten minutes ago? He no longer remembers who you are, but is damn sure you gave him mortal offense and insists on taking it outside before disappearing down the bar. When he returns a moment later he promptly introduces himself. Now I'm not unfamiliar with the levels of public intoxication and its attendant calls to violence I witnessed in England, but keep in mind that this is April and the Krewe of Bacchus is nowhere in sight. When your nightly ritual resembles nothing so much as Mardi Gras, it might be time to consider cutting back on your cups. Harsh criticism from a guest to be sure, but it's not like I'm an evangelical teetotaler. I end my days with a vodka-something or two (depending on how stressful being awake has been) and am in no position to lecture other people about the manner or amount they drink, which is mostly my point: when someone like me marvels at the manner and amount of drink a given people consume, something is seriously wrong with the world. Because when people in no position to criticize anyone are flabbergasted into embracing their own hypocrisy it means you have a problem.</span></a></div>
