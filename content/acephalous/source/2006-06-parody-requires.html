In addition to being funny on its face, the parody works because of its consonance with actual &quot;Speech Act Theory.&quot; The focus on marriage as a spoken contract jibes with centuries of thought about the necessity of consummating a marriage.

I'm writing because this afternoon I finished a disappointing Star Trek parody. Here's the idea: Ray Winstone is an excellent British actor who tends to play working-class London psychotics. Even when he's the good guy, he's usually fucking terrifying. Only once in (my) recent memory has he played against type in film, as the second safecracker in Sexy Beast. See, everyone first saw Ray Winstone as a teenager whipping other kids to death with a pool ball in a sock, screaming WHO'S THE DADDY NOW!! WHO'S THE FUCKING DADDY NOW! I'M THE DADDY NOW! He's a force of nature, a thing driven by beer and cigarettes and kicking fucking heads in. He's got a chubby face and little boy's eyes that, in the moment, go black and dead like shark's eyes. Reduces London English to a series of grunts and yelps. He is, in fact, the Greatest Living Londoner. And the whole thing unfurled as a I spoke, like a flag that someone has wiped on their arse first. Insisting on smoking on the bridge. Ray Winstone has to have his fags (which in Britain means &quot;cigarettes&quot;—it's the first term we purge from our vocabulary when we travel to America). And beer. &quot;Have one of our futuristic blue drinks with no alcohol, sir?&quot; &quot;Fuck off. Fucking pint, son. Right fucking now.&quot; That standard Star Trek moment when somone asks the captain if they can go now, and spouts some techno-bollocks at him about how the course is set and all that. &quot;Well fucking go on then, son.

The book's damn funny but ain't much of a book. Barely a parody even.* Why bad mouth one of my favorite writers? Because I've picked up the habit of beating bloody anyone who fails to live up to the expectations they've created. (Have you read nothing I've written about left homophobia and misogyny? Preoccupied pisser.) I'm increasingly convinced that my dissatisfaction—nay, my inability to find funny the decontextualized &quot;humor&quot; of Family Guy and The Simpsons comes from the inexhaustive parroting of the object of their derision. What do I mean? All the jokes are single shooters. Funny or not they don't move the plot forward. They're minimally contextualized absurdisms whose import disappears the moment they're off-screen.

			<p>Parody requires more than a fine idea.&nbsp; Take my recent &quot;Fuck Act Theory&quot; posts.&nbsp; In addition to being funny on its face, the parody works because of its consonance with actual &quot;Speech Act Theory.&quot;&nbsp; The focus on marriage as a spoken contract jibes with centuries of thought about the necessity of consummating a marriage.&nbsp; <em>Now </em>do you see why it's funny?&nbsp; What aren't you laughing already.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Some people.&nbsp; Anyhow, I write this not to toot my horn.&nbsp; For shame!&nbsp; Thinking this further evidence of my penchant for self-promotion.&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm writing because this afternoon I finished a disappointing <em>Star Trek </em>parody.&nbsp; Here's the idea:</p><blockquote><p>Ray Winstone is an excellent British actor who tends to play working-class London psychotics.&nbsp; Even when he's the good guy, he's usually fucking terrifying.&nbsp; Only once in (my) recent memory has he played against type in film, as the second safecracker in <em>Sexy Beast</em>.&nbsp; See, everyone first saw Ray Winstone as a teenager whipping other kids to death with a pool ball in a sock, screaming WHO'S THE DADDY NOW!!&nbsp; WHO'S THE FUCKING DADDY NOW!&nbsp; <strong><em>I'M </em></strong>THE DADDY NOW!&nbsp; He's a force of nature, a thing driven by beer and cigarettes and kicking fucking heads in.&nbsp; He's got a chubby face and little boy's eyes that, in the moment, go black and dead like shark's eyes.&nbsp; Reduces London English to a series of grunts and yelps. He is, in fact, the Greatest Living Londoner.</p>

<p>And the whole thing unfurled as a I spoke, like a flag that someone has wiped on their arse first.&nbsp; Insisting on smoking on the bridge.&nbsp; Ray Winstone has to have his fags (which in Britain means &quot;cigarettes&quot;—it's the first term we purge from our vocabulary when we travel to America).&nbsp; And beer.&nbsp; &quot;Have one of our futuristic blue drinks with no alcohol, sir?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Fuck off.&nbsp; Fucking <em>pint</em>, son.&nbsp; Right fucking now.&quot;&nbsp; That standard <em>Star Trek </em>moment when somone asks the captain if they can go now, and spouts some techno-bollocks at him about how the course is set and all that.&nbsp; &quot;Well fucking <em>go on then, son</em>.&nbsp; Twat.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>So says the vibrating <a href="http://www.warrenellis.com/">Warren Ellis</a>—now obliged to never change his banner lest I look the fool—in the introductory material to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1932051139/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Switchblade Honey</em></a>.&nbsp; The book's damn funny but ain't much of a book.&nbsp; Barely a parody even.*&nbsp; Why bad mouth one of my favorite writers?&nbsp; Because I've picked up the habit of beating bloody anyone who fails to live up to the expectations they've created.&nbsp; (Have you read <em>nothing </em>I've written about left homophobia and misogyny?&nbsp; Preoccupied pisser.)&nbsp; I'm increasingly convinced that my dissatisfaction—nay, my inability to find funny the decontextualized &quot;humor&quot; of <em>Family Guy </em>and <em>The Simpsons </em>comes from the inexhaustive parroting of the object of their derision.&nbsp; What do I mean?</p>

<p>All the jokes are single shooters.&nbsp; Funny or not they don't move the plot forward.&nbsp; They're minimally contextualized absurdisms whose import disappears the moment they're off-screen.&nbsp; Which is fine.&nbsp; Dandy even.&nbsp; But it guarantees the show will be no more than fleetingly funny.&nbsp; As satisfying as a bowl of sugar drenched in milk.&nbsp; The high produced bottoms out with such depressing regularity that I'd rather not tender the initial investment.&nbsp; (See what I mean about my <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/after_alluding_.html">ol' aversion</a> to the law of diminishing returns?&nbsp; <em>I want to see it burn</em>.)&nbsp; <em>Family Guy</em> produces a high that lasts no longer than the injection.&nbsp; From <em>ha-ha </em>to keening in forty-seconds flat.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I oppose such crap to the expansive humor of something genius like <em>Office Space</em>.&nbsp; The first time through you don't get the hype.&nbsp; The second time—on HBO during lunch one day—you chuckle a few times.&nbsp; By the third—repeated 3 a.m. viewings on HBOW-C9801—you can barely hold your breath or the cough medicine down.&nbsp; By the third time through <em>Family Guy </em>or <em>The Simpsons </em>you're repeating the best lines as a part of a hipster pair- or social-bonding ritual.&nbsp; It's ceased to amuse but let that on and <em>you'll blow it in front of everybody</em>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Such parody fails because it mocks without creating viewer and/or reader investment in the object of mockery.&nbsp; <em>Buffy </em>remains funny because the humor works in a particular context.&nbsp; You can't quote it out of context to impress Soy Mocha Latte Decaf with the adorable bob.&nbsp; I could make a grand statement about<em> Family Guy</em> signalling the end of connectedness—of it being the evidence of capitalism's success in alienating us from context altogether.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But this is a post is about Ellis' <em>Switchblade Honey</em>.&nbsp; It would've been better had Ellis attempted to pull some recognizable <em>Star Trek </em>stunt.&nbsp; He opens with a viable scenario but it quickly spirals into the absurd.&nbsp; You can tell the jokes came before the narrative because the narrative's tacked-on.&nbsp; Someone smart could scold me with a quick &quot;But <em>that's the point</em>.&nbsp; <em>Star Trek </em>proves that universe contains infinite <em>machina </em>ready to <em>deus ex </em>the unitarded from situations hopeless and ironic!&quot;&nbsp; (Of all the silly posts I've written this is by far the densest.&nbsp; <em>Larded</em> with underdeveloped ideas it is.)&nbsp; </p>

<p>Since you've read this far I offer my thanks in form of 1) this white and milk chocolate chip &quot;racial harmony&quot; cookie and 2) this bit of dialogue from <em>Switchblade Honey</em>.&nbsp; Ray Winstone-Pickard and his crew are about to engage the inhuman &quot;Chasta&quot; in battle.&nbsp; The pilot informs Cap' that the Chasta &quot;are blanketing communications—looks like their usual weird psychological stuff.&quot;&nbsp; The first signal arrives:</p><blockquote><p><em>WE ARE FUCKING YOUR WIVES</em><br /> </p></blockquote>

<p>The battle continues.&nbsp; As the engineer informs Cap' that &quot;thermal damage is going to be an issue&quot; the second arrives:</p><blockquote><p><em>WHILE YOU ARE OUT HERE FIGHTING IN VAIN YOUR CHILDREN ARE BEING ABUSED BY FAMOUS EARTH ACTORS LIKE BART SIMPSON.</em></p></blockquote><p>As the crew turns tail to run the third signal arrives:</p><blockquote><p><em>YOUR WIFE IS ON MICKEY MOUSE'S PHALLUS.&nbsp; SHE LIKES IT <strong>BETTER</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><p>Funny stuff.&nbsp; I only wish it could stand up to repeated readings.&nbsp; </p>

<p>*<a href="http://www.adamroberts.com/">Adam</a> knows more about parody than the lot of us.&nbsp; <em>And</em> because Ellis is a countryman, 'haps he can tell us whether <em>Switchblade Honey </em>works better in Britain.&nbsp; I doubt it does, since the failure's belongs not to the wit but the plot.)</p>

Moe as Claudius?  Barney as Dionysus?  Yes, some of the gags in these episodes are single shooters, but there are some truly hilarious and resonant elements as well.  The layers upon layers of irony and allusion and word play are really quite impressive.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-18791497-content"><p>Your accusations against the Simpsons are accurate for the later episodes. But there are many episodes from the earlier seasons that do much more than just throw out a one-off every two seconds. Earlier episodes manage to provide both well-constructed overarching humor and absurd one-offers.</p>

<p>Your accusations against Family Guy are more fair, though I think, once again, that the first few seasons have some particularly brilliant barrages of one-offers.</p>

<p>As for the claim that one only laughs at either after the first few times as part of some desperate attempt to socially bond -- no. The generic &#39;you&#39; does not always make a good substitute for &#39;I&#39;. Having others around to laugh with is a large part of the charm of rewatching episodes, but it is not the whole.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-18810070-content"><p>I guess the question of whether the Simpsons is funny is an open one--like whether certain sex acts are enjoyable or not?--but like many attempts to resolve the matter (or similar matters) one way or the other, this one doesn&#39;t do it for me.  You may not like the Simpsons, but it seems kind of dangerous, or at least annoying, to extrapolate from that to some sort of universal standard of humor.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re saying about the Simpsons and Family Guy could apply to plenty of great comedy.  Monty Python, who I think are about as funny as anyone has ever been, made their career on jokes with no larger point or context to them; the movies have more plot than the episodes, but only just.  In fact, the decision not to seek a larger context, not to find a sensible end to each sketch, is part of what made M.P. revolutionary; so it is with the Simpsons and Family Guy, I would argue, where the out-of-nowhereness actually strikes me as much more risky and funny than plenty of other material (and plenty subversive as well).  For that matter, the plot of Office Space is clever, but not really a world-beater.  Does Michael Bolton resenting the performer Michael Bolton play into the context of the plot, or is it just a great gag?  Surprise is a huge part of comedy, and dropping in a joke out of nowhere is a great--but very difficult--way of achieving that.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-18810936-content"><p>Mike, I have, and I&#39;m not saying that the writers aren&#39;t erudite or witty...merely that they don&#39;t write comedy that sticks in my craw.  It&#39;s like the empty legerdemain of so many postmodernists, you know, clever for the sake of being clever, but sorely lacking in substance.</p>

<p>Bill, I&#39;m no historian of Simpsonia, so I&#39;m not sure what period I&#39;m refering to.  I remember the early years largely for the Bartman fad, the middle period as the Cover-of-<i>Time</i>-and-<i>Newsweek</i> Era, and the stuff I&#39;ve watched lately seems to have taken lessons from Seth McFarland.</p>

<p>As for it being a matter of social bonding, I&#39;d have to say it is.  I can&#39;t count the number of times--both in life and online fora--that I&#39;ve read people reference <i>The Simpsons</i> or <i>The Family Guy</i> in lieu of making an actual joke themselves.  Happens all the time.  I&#39;m forced into a corner in which I must either admit that some intellectual titans aren&#39;t all that bright or clever, or that there&#39;s some social element to the constant quotative stream I have to put up with.</p>

<p>Tom, I didn&#39;t say it <i>wasn&#39;t</i> funny, only that it wasn&#39;t funny in any kind of substantial way.  It&#39;s not &quot;move you&quot; funny, not &quot;every time I rewatch it I find it funnier&quot; funny; it&#39;s clever, fleetingly funny, which is fine.  The difference between it and, say, <i>Monty Python&#39;s Flying Circus</i> or <i>Robot Chicken</i> is a matter of expectations; you don&#39;t expect MPFC to be much more than a pointed gag-reel because they make no pretense of plot.  You&#39;re not disappointed the way you are when, say, a nominally-about-something <i>Simpsons</i> devolves into one gag after another with no real attention to the plot.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re right, in that I need to amend the above to state that I&#39;m only talking about a failure of generic expectations, but one which reduces what could be humorous into an interchangeable bore-a-thon you sit through to get to the jokes.</p></span>

<p>But that&#39;s the point: this does not describe the Simpsons through at least the 5th Season, and perhaps into the 6th. Particularly in the 4th and 5th seasons, each episode had a &quot;metagag&quot; related to the primary plot, and most of the humor was related to the (often fairly complicated) unfolding of the plot strands that intersected with it.</p></span>

<p>Well, I don&#39;t know the Ellis <i>Switchblade Honey</i>, but it doesn&#39;t sound much cop (and believe me I know <i>a lot</i> about parodies that aren&#39;t much cop).  The problem, if I might try and diagnose a text I have not actually encountered, is in the premise.  Constellating Ray Winstone (greatest living Londoner, eh?  Hey, <i>I&#39;m</i> a Londoner!) and Captain Picard procedes on the idea that what&#39;s funny about <i>Trek TNG</i> is how wimpy, pansified and ineffectual its lavender world is.  Hence the teat from which all the laughter is milked: &#39;on the one hand here is some ridiculous piece of futuristic foppishness, and on the other is Ray telling it to FAK ORF&#39;.  This might be funny too; but I don&#39;t think it has tuned-in to what TNG is actually like.  It&#39;s not pansified and ineffectual, I think. Something the reverse.</p>

<p>If I were asked to parody Trek, and thank Thog I haven&#39;t been, I&#39;d be more likely to light upon the ideological hypocrisy of the show: the way it makes such a big deal about the Prime Directive and then interferes gaily and destructively in all manner of alien civilisations <i>all the time</i>; the way it&#39;s all talk of peace on the bridge when actually Picard is in charge of enough firepower to waste entire worlds ... and fans are really only happy when that firepower is in use (hence the Borg, the Cardassians, the many nasty aliens who provide justified targets.  Indeed, hence <i>all</i> the wars that the subsequent franchises thunder through).  The way, in fact, the Federation has such good intentions and yet seems to clump about the galaxy in enormous death-dealing boots.  A bit like the USA, you might say.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-18818699-content"><p>I think you&#39;re dead wrong about humour more generally, though, Scott.  The Simpsons does go off the boil in later series; and Family Guy is too disconnected and underwritten to really work.  But the mid-period Simpsons episodes included some of the sharpest and most hilarious scriptwriting in TV over the last three decades.  Which is saying something.</p>

<p>Nor, I&#39;d say, is Python the random gag-fest you describe it as being.  The films, which is where some of the best stuff is, are plenty coherent; even the surreal linkage of the original telly shows usually show some sort of organising principle.  There&#39;s also a real issue at the heart of Python&#39;s humour: British retreat from Empire, I&#39;d say; the anxiety of social uncertainty, the erosion of the class system, people not knowing where they are, quite how to act, what&#39;s going on.  This is what the Dada-ist oddity of Python captures so very well: figures of authority acting in bizarre ways, discourses of authority being subverted.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s a real social phenomenon in the parrotting of favourite lines of comedy.  That&#39;s certainly how Python worked when I was at school in the 70s: we memorised great screeds of it, and it acted a sort of social glue, it provided an idiom in which we could all cohere.  This isn&#39;t, in other words, just a matter of people without imagination dully mouthing these words; it&#39;s an active, often creative intertextual appropriation.  Or it can be.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-18819152-content"><p>Egads, people, when I say I can&#39;t periodize <i>The Simpons</i> I mean <i>I can&#39;t periodize The Simpsons</i>.  I haven&#39;t been entertained consistently enough by it to care to.  Perhaps, as y&#39;all attest, I&#39;ve merely been watching the wrong period or periods: too early here, too late there.  <i>But</i> I take it you don&#39;t agree with me about whatever period it is I&#39;m referencing here. </p>

<blockquote>But there&#39;s a real social phenomenon in the parrotting of favourite lines of comedy. That&#39;s certainly how Python worked when I was at school in the 70s: we memorised great screeds of it, and it acted a sort of social glue, it provided an idiom in which we could all cohere. This isn&#39;t, in other words, just a matter of people without imagination dully mouthing these words; it&#39;s an active, often creative intertextual appropriation.</blockquote>

<p>I wasn&#39;t being snarky when I said &quot;I&#39;m forced into a corner in which I must either admit that some intellectual titans aren&#39;t all that bright or clever, or that there&#39;s some social element to the constant quotative stream I have to put up with.&quot;  I mean that: the people who bandy the quotage are bright and clever, which means that they&#39;re doing something bright and clever with it, something more than just random citation.  I suppose I could&#39;ve said &quot;creative intertextual appropriation,&quot; but now that I think about it, that&#39;s not really what I see: I see extremely bright and clever people referencing it not to explain something, but to bond.  Lots of &quot;Next thing you know, [<i>citation of something random that happened on last week&#39;s Family Guy</i>]!&quot;  I don&#39;t begrudge people such humor, but they seem more social in nature, more reminders of shared laughter than an attempt to amuse people who haven&#39;t seen the show.  Rarely are such citations incorporated cleverly into the conversation.  Again, I&#39;m not judging here so much as anthropologically observing (or, reflecting on prior observations anthropoloically).  </p>

<p>That said, you&#39;re right about the thematic connections in <i>MPFC</i>--which, I admit, I like better than the films.  I think the better analogy would be stand-up: Eddie Izzard&#39;s <i>Dressed to Kill</i> is the damned funniest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.  It becomes funnier with repeated viewing because its humor emanates as much from the delivery as the jokes; whereas <i>Family Guy</i>&#39;s all about the gags.  Plus, <i>Family Guy</i> makes the pretense of plot, whereas Izzard doesn&#39;t.  (How many &quot;So anyways...&quot; are in it?)</p>

<p>What I mean to say is that I need to think about this some more, write my treatise, then lose it for 2,000 years.  Then have some monks murder each other when they think they&#39;ve found it.  Then have the 4,006 equivalent of Christian Slater lose his virginity while filming the screen version of the novel about the monks attempt to hide...or not.  (Sometimes even insomniacs run out of steam.  More tomorrow, I promise!)</p></span>

That, nope, that&#39;s just how it feels to me, but in reality I&#39;m over-appreciating shallow jokes?  That if I had watched more <i>Buffy,</i> I&#39;d know what <i>real</i> comedy feels like?  Rather, since you&#39;re a reasonable person, the only thing to say is &quot;Oh.  Well, I guess I&#39;m describing my personal preference, rather than a generally applicable principle&quot;--which makes the generalities and use of &quot;you&quot; rather than &quot;I&quot; sort of inappropriate to the situation.  The same problem exists with saying that you&#39;re &quot;not judging so much as anthropologically observing&quot; when you say that quotation from <i>Simpsons</i> and <i>Family Guy</i> (and quotation from <i>Buffy</i>?) is social rather than clever.   Well, if that judgment is based on an empirical observation, I guess that&#39;s that.</p></span>

<p>That their broad applicability, the ease with which they&#39;re divorced from their original context and slipped into another substantiates my claim that the humor isn&#39;t embedded in a particular narrative <i>a la Buffy</i> or <i>Office Space</i>.  </p>

<p>I hope this doesn&#39;t get me booted from the Derridevils, but I think you&#39;re missing the point: I&#39;m not saying <i>Family Guy</i> or <i>The Simpsons</i> <i>isn&#39;t</i> funny, only that they&#39;re <i>differently</i> funny in a way I find far less satisfying than humor organic to the narrative in which they appear.  You know, laughs that don&#39;t even make sense outside their immediate context, whose humor lacks the &quot;broad applicability&quot; you value.  </p>

<p>By which I mean: I don&#39;t even think we&#39;re arguing, here, since we seem to be saying the same thing.  As for the social element to <i>Simpson</i>&#39;s quotations, I speak from experience when I say that they&#39;re not as funny when they&#39;re applied broadly, but since they&#39;re bound to the context in which they originally appeared so loosely, I can only posit that they strike intelligent, clever people as funny when quoted is that they point back to some originary moment of laughter, one which everyone who saw the episode shares, and which can be invoked via citation.  For example, if I were set up this sentence such that I cracked wise about threatening you with a cantelope, you&#39;d laugh because you catch the reference and quickly reconstruct the original scene in your head.  You <i>may</i> laugh because it&#39;s absurd in itself, but it&#39;s not the slam-dunk the <i>Monty Python</i> reference would be.  The only way to make it a slam dunk would be to write something which is only funny in the context of this comment, which makes no sense outside it, which depends on what I say here to be funny.  </p>

<p>For example, extract <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/disadventure.html" rel="nofollow">a few lines from this</a> and they won&#39;t be funny.  Why?  Because the effect&#39;s cumulative, and as such is unquotable.  That&#39;s how my sense of humor works, and why I value the comedy I do more than that I don&#39;t.  (Note to self: <i>Duh</i>.)  I&#39;m not a sharp-wit, quick with the turn-of-phrase, and while I appreciate people who are--Forgotten Boy&#39;s a master of the craft--I tend to like narrative-driven comedy better than wit-driven.  This is all coming out wrong.  Wait for my manifesto, already!</p>

<p>Finally, thanks for reading.  I love finding out that people I know have been reading me on the sly (and it&#39;s happening more and more these days).  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-18859818-content"><p>Hey, once a Derridevil, always a Derridevil.  Sorry I construed your position as an anti-Simpsons polemic; I now understand your point about the difference between plot-based and...not plot-based humor (to be fair, the title of the piece is &quot;Why Buffy is Funny, Family Guy Isn&#39;t...&quot; and you did refer to the two shows as &quot;crap,&quot; &quot;a bowl of sugar drenched in milk,&quot; and &quot;&#39;humor&#39;&quot;...).  However, I don&#39;t know if the line between them is particularly sharp--for instance, I don&#39;t think I agree that <i>Office Space</i> is such a great example of comedy that only works in context, and thus can only be absorbed through repeated viewing and consideration.  On the contrary, for years (until <i>Napoleon Dynamite</i> came along) my friends quoted that far more often than any other comedy besides <i>The Big Lebowski</i>.  I can tell you from experience that people love to say &quot;Have you seen my stapler&quot; or &quot;I wouldn&#39;t say I <i>missed</i> it, Bob&quot; on the slightest of pretenses; on the flip side, the actual plot elements of that movie seem unimportant enough that I had to be reminded of most of them.  The fact, I think, is that comedy is always a mixture of context and surprise, and just as you don&#39;t find many jokes that are completely random and out of context (Q: How many surrealists does it take to change a lightbulb?  A: The fish), you also don&#39;t find many that also serve as pragmatic lines that significantly move the story along.  Other than that, it&#39;s just a matter of what makes you guffaw and what doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Anyway.  No need to thank me for reading--thanks for writing; I&#39;ve only recently begun reading but I enjoy it.  If I can plug here, my own blog is raptor.slc.edu/blogs/tomemos.  The frequency of updates, readership, and effort put in are all less than you have here, but thought I&#39;d mention anyway.</p></span>

'Cause Now I YouTube Too.</strong> For the first time in my life &quot;next September&quot; won't involve sitting in or standing before a classroom. I've taken all the deep breaths I can short of hyperventilating and am still a little unsettled by the thought. 'Cause quarter-century habits die hard. Expect little intellectual from these parts until I catch my breath. Here's some entertainment instead. I browsed YouTube for the first time tonight and learned stuff: Tom Waits doesn't want to grow up, but in about 5 minutes he'll be so full of bourbon he can't stand up and someone'll convince him to endorse meat. The Replacements are young bastards. Children by the million scream for Alex Chilton but slum along with Paul on The Skyway. Leonard Cohen renews his neurotic affiliation with Canada, proves he's as beautiful man as he is a loser and told you when he came in 1967 he was a stranger. Neko implores you to hold on. Maybe the sparrow can explain why she reminds me of Johnette. Will someone please give Mr. Tweedy a shot in the arm? Wanna play in the Bronx? You'll have to cut your hair before they'll bring on the major leagues. I will get tenure. I have my very own official ironman rally song. If that fails, well, I'm not afraid to use my valuable hunting knife. 'Course then I'll have to start a new life. But I say you take these things head on or not at all.</span></a></div>
