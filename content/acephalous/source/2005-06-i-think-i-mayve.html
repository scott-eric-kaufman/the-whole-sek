According to David Denby's review in this weeks New Yorker (an excellent venue for quasi-academic--i.e. &quot;intelligent&quot;--criticism whose virtues are currently being discussed elsewhere), one of Nolan's failings is that There's very little sense of Batman's awesome surveillance of the city from the heights; he just drops out of nowhere, thrashes all the bad guys in a whirl of movement that is shot too close, and edited too rapiedly, for us to see much of anything, and then elevates out of the frame. Denby also notes how it lacks the punch and punch-lines of the earlier films and television series. I'll discuss the above quotation in a little more detail shortly, but for the meantime, let me make my general argument clear: sometimes critics ought to evaluate what things are on their own merits--and in the context in which they're being created--and sometimes they ought to evaluate things for what they should be. Denby's expectations of a Christopher Nolan-helmed, Christian Bale-starring reinterpretation of the darker aspects of the Batman mythology, i.e. the early years, are a smidgen unrealistic. Let me begin with the paragraph quoted above. It is an entirely accurate account of the early fight scenes in the film, but difficult as this may be to believe, it's entirely intentional.

His agitated glance is thrown rapidly from one spot to another. If we imitate this glance with the camera we get a series of pictures, rapidly alternating pieces, creating a stirring scenario editing-construction. [Emphasis in original.] Now, imagine to yourself a young man, recently trained in combat, who rapels into and out of fights with multiple opponents, and then ask yourself why that ackwardly translated Russian concept--&quot;a stirring scenario editing-construction&quot;--might not fit the needs of the scene.

				<p>Let me begin with the paragraph quoted above.&nbsp; It is an entirely accurate account of the early fight scenes in the film, but difficult as this may be to believe, it's entirely intentional.&nbsp; Reaching back to the one film theory course I ever took, I quote from Vsevolod Pudovkin's <em>Film Technique</em>, a work notable for its technical discussions of the effects of shots on an audience without invoking psychoanalysis:</p><blockquote><p>Imagine to yourself the excited observer of some rapidly developing scene.&nbsp; His agitated glance is thrown rapidly from one spot to another.&nbsp; If we imitate this glance with the camera we get a series of pictures, rapidly alternating pieces, creating a <em>stirring scenario editing-construction</em>.&nbsp; [Emphasis in original.]</p></blockquote><p>Now, imagine to yourself a young man, recently trained in combat, who rapels into and out of fights with multiple opponents, and then ask yourself why that ackwardly translated Russian concept--&quot;a stirring scenario editing-construction&quot;--might not fit the needs of the scene.&nbsp; In context, Nolan creates tension by having the audience sympathize with the villians: an Antonioni-esque shot follows one of them, visibly frightened, as he paces a deserted stretch of pavement, hedged in by industrial cargo-crates stacked fifty-feet high; quick cut to his face, a classic example of Hitchcock's &quot;framing for emotion,&quot; in which the tension's juiced by proximity to an emotionally distraught human face; cut to his perspective, watch shadows dance; back to the Antonioni homage; more shadows; more noises; more close-ups; back to the Antonioni; etc.&nbsp; </p>

<p>What Nolan's doing here--and what I believe he does quite well--is attune the audience's sympathies both with Bale's Bruce Wayne, who is, in this sequence, taking his first stab at vigilantism, and with his first potential mark.&nbsp; That tension is built up and dispersed rather quickly, but I don't think it's an example of MTV-editing, or if it is, it's done effectively.&nbsp; What Nolan isn't doing is aiming his &quot;digital spectacle...at twelve- to twenty-four-year-old males [who have] never known the satisfactions of story and characterization and emotional involvement.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>As a sometimes film snob--invite me to be your &quot;Netflix Friend&quot; and if I consider you worthy you can have a gander at all the &quot;films&quot; sandwiched between episodes of <em>Alias</em>--I'll be the first to bemoan the sacrifice of &quot;story and characterization and emotional involvement&quot; in a mainstream Hollywood production.&nbsp; (And when I say I'll be &quot;first,&quot;I mean that literarlly, as it's part of the snob ethos: it's not enough to disdain with haughty phrase...one must be the first to do so.)&nbsp; I didn't notice any sacrifices of the sort.&nbsp; In fact, one of the aspects of the film that bothered me was its attempts at an overarching and uniting theme.&nbsp; Film buffs like me--jaded by the thematic excesses of '70s auteurs--often fail to differentiate between themeless action films like the complete corpus of Michael Bay (whose &quot;themes&quot; run the gamut from &quot;Being a Good Father&quot; to &quot;Patriotism is Nifty!&quot;) and the quite themely spate of recent franchise comic book adaptations.&nbsp; Now, maybe Singer's&nbsp; anti-xenophobia statements in the <em>X-Men </em>films is a little heavy-handed--and maybe Nolan leans to heavily on the &quot;some fears can't be overcome&quot; theme in <em>Batman Begins</em>--but even imperfectly executed, they're far more interesting, thematically, than Bay's patriotic paeans.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Wow, I wrote an awful lot about <em>Batman Begins</em>.&nbsp; Whatever suspicions you may have about my mental health are probably correct.</p>

		<span id="comment-6300172-content"><p>I agree with you. I think Denby is way off here. I was really impressed with <i>Batman Begins</i> for a variety of reasons, but a primary one is all the ways the film <i>wasn&#39;t</i> a typical summer spectacle aimed at 12-year olds. My God, Nolan spends half the movie purely developing character! True, the last third of the film is more typical action fare, but they gave Nolan $150 million to make this movie so he can&#39;t completely ignore action convention. Plus, this movie was very dark for a summer blockbuster. I can&#39;t believe they let him do what he did (let&#39;s hope they don&#39;t ruin the sequels).</p>

<p>I think you are right on about the editing, but an even more pragmatic reason for the fast cutting may be that Nolan was going for as much &quot;realism&quot; as you can get from a superhero movie. It&#39;s quite possible that without the fast-cuts and cu shots during the fight scenes, the silliness of a man dressed up like a bat was more evident. </p>

<p>Also, Nolan was really emphasizing the fear factor of Batman--how Batman only works because he generates fear, how is more a myth than real in the minds of the people of Gotham. So putting us in Batman&#39;s perspective surveilling the city (as Denby wants) isn&#39;t the best way to get that concept across. Now putting the spectator in the perspective of the criminals who are scared shitless as Batman drops down out of nowhere seems more appropriate. </p>

<p>Honestly, this Batman movie is for the Frank Miller crowd--for those of us who love Miller&#39;s <i>Batman: Year One</i> and <i>Dark Knight Returns</i> and also Grant Morrison&#39;s <i>Arkham Asylum</i>. There are other Batman traditions, but Nolan&#39;s film is definitely tapping into the Miller tradition. </p></span>

I believe the good folks at Spinning Clio have done me the favor of not associating one with the other. I only hope the folks they point over here don't read this post. Then the game'd be all up.

The traditional approach to history in an English course is typically uni-directional. For pedagogical reasons, English-types presume history an unchanging stable scrim onto which they project the complexities of a literary text: “Look, children, look! Labor trouble at the turn-of-the-century! What does Looking Backward say about it? How does Bellamy’s novel allegorize, reflect, register, represent, symbolize or otherwise transmogrify that dull dry history into a capital-A work of Art?&quot;* As Miriam points out, “it’s very easy to slip into the habit of presenting historical background stripped of its own disciplinary signposts--especially when we don’t actually know the debates surrounding our history of choice.” She further “suspect[s] that many of us--[herself] included--present the history as somehow denuded of disagreement, while emphasizing the complexity of the assigned literary works.” Her suspicion’s justified. When teaching a novel as influential as Looking Backward the problem becomes even thornier: to stick with the scrim-metaphor, now the complex literary work isn’t merely being projected on the scrim, it’s altering its molecular composition. The dim pinks become bright reds and the dark purples pale to lavender as the advent of an evangelical Christian socialism sweeps across the country. Should an English professor foreground the novel-as-impetus-for-cultural-change or the cultural-moment-ripe-for-an-impetuous-novel? (Yes, I desperately need to refresh my German. Or forget it entirely.) Short of resorting to a clumsy New Historicist leveling of all discourses, I’m curious as to how you, dear readers, confront (and confound) these dilemmas in the classroom or your own work. Or do you consider historical and formal questions utterly divorced and English professors only qualified to speak to the latter? *Could I come up with a clunkier and more unartistic novel to stand as my exemplar of an aesthetic interpretation of an historical moment?</span></a></div>
