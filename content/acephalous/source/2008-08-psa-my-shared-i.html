Not really, of course. Only if it’s postmodern or romantic, and today it’s romantic. Edwin Markham’s The Real America in Romance (1909) sought to blend “authentic history and romance … to their mutual advantage.” His rationale: Here are set before us the examples of great men of earth, men great in their patriotism and self-sacrifice; and side by side with them are romantic characters typical of the times, men and women only less great in their kindliness and unselfishness, all affording a high expression of the art of Anglo-Saxon romance. Instead of reading about historical characters and events, we see the persons themselves in action, and live with them through the events of their day and generation. The reader loses himself in the irresistible fascination of the story, and the impressions resulting are made on the heart as well as on the intellect. You do not merely read about Columbus: you endure with him his hardships, share with him his disappointments, rejoice with him in his achievements. You actually feel the thrill of discovery when the New World swims into his vision. Not content with telling you merely that Washington wintered and suffered at Valley Forge with his army, the author takes you straightway into the camp, shows you the torn and bleeding feet of the soldiers, and makes you stand watch with the half-fed sentries, with little to warm your blood except a fiery determination to die of cold, hunger, or British bullets, rather than give up the fight for your country. That’s a single paragraph in the original, but I’ve sliced it up 1) because it’s overlong, and 2) to emphasize a rhetorical shift from “the reader” to “you.” What opens as a theory of literary affect quickly pivots into admonishment — the reader who doesn’t endure, share, rejoice, winter, suffer or stand watch isn’t merely a bad reader but unpatriotic. “If you have fail to empathize with those who fought ‘for your country,’” Markham as much as says, “you’re a terrible American.” He never considers a reader might withhold sympathy not because he or she possesses a paucity of patriotism, but because his bathetic prose betrays an ear unworthy of enthused encomium. Consider the first sentence of Volume IX, The Stars &amp; Stripes: A band of boys was abroad in the streets of Boston. But Scott, you say, happy accidents have happened heretofore! Granted. Now consider the first two sentences of the second paragraph: But it was not mirth nor mischief that brought them forth to throng the streets. So much might have been inferred from their eager and excited talk as they hurried over the flagging, covered thinly with snow. Those alliterative pairs — “mirth nor mischief” and “eager and excited” — bespeak a deliberately alliterative aesthetic agenda. Still don’t believe me? Turn to the twenty-first page and proceed to ponder this passage: Then the people, or such of them as did not feel the restraint of the more orderly element, rose in riot. The...</span></a></div>

On this day in 1934, Augustus Hand scored a second, binding victory for psychological realism. Obscenity charges had bedeviled James Joyce’s Ulysses before he even finished it. In 1920 the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice convinced the Post Office to seize four installments of the novel published in The Little Review: “Lestrygonians,” “Scylla and Charybdis,” “Cyclops,” and “Nausicaa.” No one had any clue what to make of the first three chapters, but the fourth was certainly somehow pornographic. The book-in-process was deemed obscene and banned. It would remain so until 1933, when Random House challenged the — wait for it, wait for it – Hawley-Smoot (sometimes known as Smoot-Hawley) Tariff Act’s prohibition on immoral articles. In United States v. One Book “Called Ulysses,” John Woolsey was only asked to determine whether the novel was obscene. His opinion, however, was a tactful, informed defense of psychological realism: In writing “Ulysses,” Joyce sought to make a serious experiment in a new, if not wholly novel, literary genre. He takes persons of the lower middle class living in Dublin in 1904 and seeks, not only to describe what they did on a certain day early in June of that year as they went about the city bent on their usual occupations, but also to tell what many of them thought about the while. Joyce has attempted — it seems to me, with astonishing success — to show how the screen of consciousness with its ever-shifting kaleidoscopic impressions carries, as it were on a plastic palimpsest, not only what is in the focus of each man’s observation of the actual things about him, but also in a penumbral zone residua of past impressions, some recent and some drawn up by association from the domain of the subconscious. He shows how each of these impressions affects the life and behavior of the character which he is describing. What he seeks to get is not unlike the result of a double or, if that is possible, a multiple exposure on a cinema film, which would give a clear foreground with a background visible but somewhat blurred and out of focus in varying degrees. To convey by words an effect which obviously lends itself more appropriately to a graphic technique, accounts, it seems to me, for much of the obscurity which meets a reader of “Ulysses.” And it also explains another aspect of the book, which I have further to consider, namely, Joyce’s sincerity and his honest effort to show exactly how the minds of his characters operate. If Joyce did not attempt to be honest in developing the technique which he has adopted in “Ulysses,” the result would be psychologically misleading and thus unfaithful to his chosen technique. Such an attitude would be artistically inexcusable. It is because Joyce has been loyal to his technique and has not funked its necessary implications, but has honestly attempted to tell fully what his characters think about, that he has been the subject of so...</span></a></div>
