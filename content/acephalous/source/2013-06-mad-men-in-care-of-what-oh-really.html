        <meta name="description" content="The season finale of Mad Men, “In Care Of,” contains an inordinate number of what I call “Oh Really?” reverse shots. They typically don’t involve dialogue — and the episode will end with one that doesn’t — but at the beginning of the episode it does. It’s also odd because it substitutes a flashback for an “Oh Really?” escalation, but I’m getting ahead of myself. When representatives from the Sheraton Royal Hawaiian arrive at whatever the name of the firm is at this point — because not knowing the firm is part of the point at this point — Don Draper isn’t in the office. You may remember the Royal Hawaiian from the season premier, and if you do, you can probably anticipate Don’s whereabouts. Here he is at the Royal Hawaiian: That’s the opening shot of Draper at the Royal Hawaiian’s bar. Note the quality of the light: there are two on screen sources — the lamp to Don’s left and the Tiki fixture to his right — and a noticeable off-screen, but still diegetic light illuminating the painting from above. The lighting is high-key, that is, the back and fill lights complement the key light in a way that creates low contrast between brighter and darker areas. (I write “complement” because there are many ways the effect of high-key lighting can be produced: all manners of angles and intensities come into play.) Of the previous episode, “The Quality of Mercy,” I noted that Don’s shadows were eating at his face because the back and fill lights weren’t providing it illumination. Even though his back is turned in the shot above, were Don to turn around his face would be plenty covered by the back light. All of which is only to say that the light is natural and gentle in this scene at the Royal Hawaiian bar. Which is significant given that when the Royal Hawaiian representatives arrive in New York, Don’s not available to greet them because he’s here: At this point, I hope you don’t need me to point out the structural similarities between these two shots. There are many ways to shoot a man at a bar — I know, I know — but to shoot the same man regarding relations with the same corporation in such a similar manner invites comparison. Whereas the scene at the Royal Hawaiian is lit in a high-key, this is clearly lit in the low-key that’s characterized Don’s relation to alcohol the past three episodes. (Just look at the poor man pouring vodka.) The low-key lighting allows the diegetic lights sources — the illuminated bar and the television set — to provide the majority of the illumination. Meaning there isn’t much of any because Don’s in a darker place. Remember the “dark wood” that Don read about Dante awakening in while at the Royal Hawaiian?

			<p>The season finale of <em>Mad Men</em>, “In Care Of,” contains an inordinate number of what I call “Oh Really?” <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#51531">reverse shots</a>.
 They typically don’t involve dialogue — and the episode will end with 
one that doesn’t — but at the beginning of the episode it does. It’s 
also odd because it substitutes a flashback for an “Oh Really?” 
escalation, but I’m getting ahead of myself. When representatives from 
the Sheraton Royal Hawaiian arrive at whatever the name of the firm is 
at this point — because not knowing the firm is part of the point at 
this point — Don Draper isn’t in the office. You may remember the Royal 
Hawaiian from the season premier, <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2013/04/mad-men-dont-go-into-the-doorway-don.html">and if you do</a>, you can probably anticipate Don’s whereabouts. Here he is at the Royal Hawaiian:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d42a31589970c-800wi.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d42a31589970c-800wi.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="6a00d8341c2df453ef017d42a31589970c-800wi" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>That’s the opening shot of Draper at the Royal Hawaiian’s bar. Note 
the quality of the light: there are two on screen sources — the lamp to 
Don’s left and the Tiki fixture to his right — and a noticeable 
off-screen, but still <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/basic-terms.htm#25890">diegetic</a>
 light illuminating the painting from above. The lighting is high-key, 
that is, the back and fill lights complement the key light in a way that
 creates low contrast between brighter and darker areas. (I write 
“complement” because there are many ways the effect of high-key lighting
 can be produced: all manners of angles and intensities come into play.)
 Of the previous episode, “The Quality of Mercy,” I noted <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/06/mad-men-fencing-with-shadows-over-the-quality-of-mercy">that Don’s shadows were eating at his face</a>
 because the back and fill lights weren’t providing it illumination. 
Even though his back is turned in the shot above, were Don to turn 
around his face would be plenty covered by the back light. All of which 
is only to say that the light is natural and gentle in this scene at the
 Royal Hawaiian bar. Which is significant given that when the Royal 
Hawaiian representatives arrive in New York, Don’s not available to 
greet them because he’s here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00142.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00142.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00142" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>At this point, I hope you don’t need me to point out the structural 
similarities between these two shots. There are many ways to shoot a man
 at a bar — I know, I know — but to shoot the same man regarding 
relations with the same corporation in such a similar manner invites 
comparison. Whereas the scene at the Royal Hawaiian is lit in a 
high-key, this is clearly lit in the low-key that’s characterized Don’s 
relation to alcohol the past three episodes. (<a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-the-quality-of-mercy00006.png"><em>Just look at the poor man pouring vodka</em></a>.)
 The low-key lighting allows the diegetic lights sources — the 
illuminated bar and the television set — to provide the majority of the 
illumination. Meaning there isn’t much of any because Don’s in a darker 
place. Remember the “<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/8789/8789-h/8789-h.htm#link1">dark wood</a>”
 that Don read about Dante awakening in while at the Royal Hawaiian? 
Clearly Don hadn’t actually reached it yet. At the brightly lit bar he 
interacted with an American icon — the serviceman on shore leave — and 
never went home that night because, as <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2013/04/mad-men-dont-go-into-the-doorway-don.html">I noted in my post on “The Doorway,”</a> he’d abandoned his wife to give another woman away in marriage. But all that happened in a luminous Hawaiian past.</p>
<p>Now when Hawaii comes mid-day calling in New York, Don’s in a bar 
that hasn’t seen sunlight since the first time Nixon ran for President. 
And when another American icon — the itinerant evangelical preacher — 
starts talking about brotherhood at the bar, Don’s so rattled <em>it’s almost as if he can recognize the structural similarities with the scene from “The Doorway.” </em>The
 young serviceman with whom he shared a moment of brotherhood — false 
though it may be on Don’s part — has been replaced by a preacher who’s <em>selling</em>
 his idea of a brotherhood to strangers at a bar. The idea likely 
offends Don both as a man and an ad man: the quality of the preacher’s 
salesmanship is so shoddy Don can’t help but interrupt his pitch. When 
the preacher asks his profession, he replies “Keeping out of other 
people’s business,” which isn’t exactly the best description of someone 
who works in advertising. That’s likely why the preacher’s response, 
“You’re not doing a very good job of it,” stings Don more than it 
should. It’s little wonder he’s annoyed when the preacher approaches. 
Here’s how the scene actually proceeds:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of-montage-01.jpg"><img alt="" height="1691" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of-montage-01.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of montage 01" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We’ll talk about where the scene cuts to momentarily, because I want 
to note that while the content of the scene isn’t unimportant, the “Oh 
Really?” reverse shots are doing quite a bit of heavy lifting here. The 
initial invasion of Don’s personal space by the preacher is a violation,
 but it’s only the first: the preacher leans in when he speaks until, in
 the fifth frame above, the director, someone named Matthew Weiner, opts
 for a close-up on the preacher’s face. Between the preacher leaning in 
and the close-up — close-ups being violations of our personal space that
 <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/09/game-of-thrones-winter-is-coming-for-will-and-bran.html#1">we’ve become accustomed to via biology and habit</a>
 — Weiner’s pushing this man into Don’s face. Think about it: how often 
are you close enough to someone’s face to see it as closely as you do in
 a close-up? If you’re not a dentist or an ENT or about to kiss someone,
 I’d wager not very often. Despite our desire to read faces — as 
discussed at the link — we’re also made uncomfortable by close-ups, and 
here Weiner’s mapping Don’s discomfort onto the shot by using such a 
short scale. As the “Oh Really” reversals follow one after the other 
into the close-up, a necessary escalation that looks something like this
 occurs:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of-montage-02.jpg"><img alt="" height="1691" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of-montage-02.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of montage 02" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>At this point one expects the escalation to climax with some 
violence, but instead Weiner throws to a flashback of a young Don 
encountering a similarly unpersuasive man of the cloth:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00007.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00007.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00007" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>As we learn later in the episode, Don’s opinions are not yet formed. 
But Weiner wants us to understand that this may have been where they 
were. That boy there? He simply doesn’t care enough — about <em>anything </em>– to start matching someone “Really” for “Oh Really.” He simply watches the bordello’s owner toss the preacher on the street:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00014.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00014.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00014" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The long shot is significant not just because it allows more of the 
house to be visible, but because it provides the very emotional distance
 between the preacher and Don that was lacking in the previous scene. 
Even when Weiner reverses to the preacher in a two-shot with Don:</p>

<p>And has the preacher inform him that “The only unpardonable sin is to believe God cannot forgive you,” Don is impassive.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00017.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00017.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00017" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>He’s <em>so </em>impassive that the house itself apparently feels the need to stick up for him:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00018.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00018.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00018" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Not that he gives a shit:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00019.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00019.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00019" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>But look what happened when the camera zoomed back in on Don. It’s 
the same shot in terms of composition — a medium close-up on Don — but 
compare it to the one that preceded the interrupting house. It’s not 
just tighter — giving us a closer look at Don’s uncaring face — it’s <em>darker</em>.
 The increased contrast may just be an artifact of shooting outside. A 
cloud may have passed over as Weiner shot the reverse. But even if 
that’s the case, Weiner could’ve waited until the cloud finished passing
 and re-shot it, or lightened it in post-production to match the 
previous shot. And given the emphasis on how Don’s lit the past three 
episodes — if not the entire season — I think it’s safe to say that this
 particular darkening is deliberate, as there’s no other reason to cut 
back to Don’s expressionless face after the shot of the house. His 
inability to see hope, in whatever guise it may come, seems to be the 
origin of his darkness, and this may be the moment where he discovered 
that he can’t find hope in God. While initially his feelings about this 
non-source of hope may have been trivial, by the time he exchanges 
“REALLY” with the preacher above he feels so strongly about it that he 
follows this night at the bar with the same entity he spent the last: 
the significant absence of Megan:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00023.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00023.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00023" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Only this time Weiner treats the “marriage is a prison” line a little
 more literally, since he actually ends up in jail for punching the 
preacher. It’s significant that we don’t get the gratifying image of Don
 actually attacking the preacher, because that’d be gratifying. It’s 
best to see him riled up and suffering the consequences without getting 
to enjoy the act itself because that’s Don’s life at this point. It’s 
all suffering and consequences and will continue to be unless he 
addresses it. Wasn’t I saying something about someone not yet awakening,
 disoriented, in a “dark wood” earlier? Because this might qualify — 
much more so than finding one’s self on a beach in Hawaii reading about 
somebody else awakening in a “dark wood.”</p>
<p>And that’s where I’ll leave you for today. Except more tomorrow. Possibly more all week. Rejoice or disdain accordingly.</p>

Directed by Jay Olivia and released in two parts in 2012 and 2013, it belongs to the Zack Snyder School of Literal Filmmaking, in which the idea is to replicate particularly stirring comic panels on the big screen by unwittingly mangling the elements that make them stirring. Consider Snyder’s adaptation of Watchmen. We don’t even need to venture past the opening credits to see where the film misses the point. But before we do that, I should note that I’m not complaining generally about a lack of faithfulness in adaptation. Comics and film are different media and ought to be treated as such. I don’t mind if changes are made that alter the narrative in an interesting fashion. But Snyder preaches fidelity as his ethos, so taken at his word, deviations from the comic in his films aren’t “interesting alterations” so much as the “necessary accommodations” of adapting any medium into another. These changes are being made by a lover of the source material who would never be unfaithful to the “spirit” of the original. For what it’s worth, I think Snyder’s dead honest about his commitment to accurately representing both individual panels and the “spirit” of the original work on screen — he simply happens to be terrible at doing so. Back to the opening minutes of Watchmen, in which Rorschach’s investigating the Comedian’s murder. Both the novel and the film begin with a close-up of the Comedian’s iconic image before pulling back to the skyscraper window from which it fell. Book: Film: I’ve turned on the subtitles in order to make the difference between the novel and the film clear. Although both pull back to great heights, in the novel the emphasis during the slow transition from the ground floor to the Comedian’s apartment is on the content of Rorschach’s journal. You can tell because it occupies a little more than a third of the first three panels and the other visual information is merely repetitive. This isn’t necessarily the case when a camera zooms out — and readers of the novel recognize that there is relevant information in the third panel — but in this case seeing some anonymous man walk through the pool of blood isn’t necessarily useful information. (Readers might associate the anhedonic tone of the journal and the callousness with which the redheaded man walks through the pool of blood, but who among us was that clever at eleven?) Point being: Snyder’s made the minor directorial decision to move the interior narration of the journal to when Rorschach actually appears: Same lines from the first panel of the comic, they’ve just been shifted forward to remove the mystery of their author. There’s just one problem: in the film, the implication is that Rorschach’s...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2013/06/mad-men-disappointment-in-care-of-convention.html"><span><strong>Mad Men: Disappointment “In Care Of” Convention</strong> In my previous post on “In Care Of,” I defined an “Oh Really” sequence as as structure of escalating exchanges that requires no dialogue to be understood. What I didn’t say — but which should make perfect sense in retrospect — is that such sequences are most often found in the saloons of classic American Westerns. Just consider what would happen to that scene if you put Don in a ridiculously large cowboy hat: Don didn’t need to take off his hat to inform us of impending violence: the structure of the shots and reverse shots is so familiar that the context of the scene matters more than the content. Two men being filmed in this manner in a “saloon” inevitably leads to fisticuffs and gun play. The logic of the escalation is “drunkenly disproportionate” even if neither of the parties involved is actually drunk. Because we know how this scene ends, Weiner need not actually show Don striking the minister. But we want him to. The tension mounts but Weiner provides no release — instead he relies on our familiarity with this sequence to cut to a flashback, because he knows we’ll only be momentarily confused. He effectively holds that tension in abeyance throughout the flashback, but instead of relieving it by cutting back to the scene at the bar like we want him to, he suspends it in perpetuity by moving the narrative a few hours forward in time: All of which is only to say that Weiner’s playing with the conventions of the “Oh Really” sequence in order to frustrate the the expectations of his audience. You may not have consciously recognized the structure of the scene when you watched “In Care Of,” but years of experience watching films and television conditioned you to be disappointed by its result. As well you should be. The entire episode’s structured around disappointment: from the title that doesn’t specify who or what’s “In Care Of” to Don and Ted’s respective beliefs about their prospects in New York; or from the firm’s feelings about Don’s recent performance to Peggy’s about the end of her relationship with Ted and the insult that is her temporary “promotion.” Weiner so wants us to be disappointed that — like the bar from the first episode of this season — he rewrites the most triumphant scene from the first season: Don’s presentation in “The Wheel.” It’s not just the classic Draper pitch scene: its central concerns are creating a “sentimental bond with a product” via “nostalgia,” which is the same tactic Don uses to approach Hershey. But at that time Don’s life intruded into his presentation because he deliberately put it there. He was simply surprised by the results. As I wrote: Don’s in a redoubled-blind here: he loathes Betty, but must pretend to love her for the Eastman Kodak people; but as he’s pretending to love her, he genuinely feels the nostalgia he thinks the Carousel will mass-produce; but because he’s in the middle of...</span></a></div>
