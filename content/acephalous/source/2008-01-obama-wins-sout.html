		<span id="comment-98756170-content"><p>Sure, Barack Obama won the South Carolina primary with the help of black voters. The real story, though, went unreported by the media until today, and that is that the Clintons lost that election because they are baby pinchers. While they are supposedly bending over to kiss a baby, they actually pinch it. If you don&#39;t believe me, maybe you&#39;ll believe the Associated Press:</p>

<p><br />
<i>

<p>The Associated Press has looked at thousands of hours of videotape and noted that almost all the babies were not crying before the Clinton kiss, but were crying immediately afterwards. In addition, throngs of teary-eyed mothers have provided pictures of the welts and bruises allegedly left behind by the pinchers, and in some cases, they have brought the babies to reporters to see the bruising first hand. </p>

<p>When asked to comment earlier today, former President Bill Clinton wagged his finger, looked straight into the camera, and said: &quot;I did not have a pinching relationship with that ... baby.&quot;</p>

<p>... </i>   </p>

<p>www.msnbc/babypinching-myrtle.html</p>

<p><br />
PARODY WARNING: This is a parody. There is actually no conclusive video evidence of &quot;baby pinching,&quot; and in fact, the &quot;Clinton Baby Pinching Ring,&quot; which is what they like to be called now, denies, categorically, any baby pinching. Do not take this parody on an empty stomach. Ask your doctor if parody is right for you. That is all.</p>

<p><br />
Vote OBAMA in &#39;08. <br />

		<span id="comment-98800974-content"><p>LB: I think &quot;prefer&quot; is probably a better word than &quot;support,&quot; since chances are these democrats will support whoever ends up as the one candidate. Feelings of alienation are inevitable, but remember that this is perhaps less a problem with the democrats than with the other side: after all, the corporate-cons want Romney, the neocons want Giuliani (and have McCain as cold comfort), and the theocons want Huck, and however violent the disagreement on our side, it&#39;s far worse on theirs. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-98939268-content"><p>Hermit Greg, I actually noticed the placement of white people directly behind Obama, since the media undercut his staff&#39;s efforts by showing reaction shots of the crowd -- it seemed like 90 percent of the white people in the room were directly behind him, which was, obviously, to the benefit of his message.  As to mine, though, I was more heartened by the general air of enfranchisement exuded by the audience.  Hence, <em>The Invisible Man</em>.</p></span>

Jan. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Barack Obama, fresh from a landslide victory over Hillary Clinton in the South Carolina Democratic presidential primary, plans to continue a campaign that is long on the need for change and inspiration and short on specifics. <br />
__________________</p>

<p>Note the last clause of that long sentence. If you put that clause togther with it&#39;s subject, it reads: </p>

<p>Barack Obama ... plans to continue a campaign that is long on the need for change and inspiration and short on specifics. </p>

<p>Did Barack Obama say that? Did one of his chief advisors say that? Is that a matter of fact, now? How did Clinton Talking Point #1 get into the first sentence of a Bloomberg wire report about Obama&#39;s South Carolina victory? Because nobody was quoted, I&#39;m suggesting invisible people.     </p></span>

In <a href="http://z.about.com/d/politicalhumor/1/0/F/C/hillary_closer.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a> picture, you can see baby-pincher Hillary Clinton with that oh-so-familiar look that baby pinchers get right before they &quot;get their pinch on.&quot; The poor baby doesn&#39;t know know what&#39;s coming. The other woman pictured is what Clinton staffers call a &quot;baby wrangler.&quot; These baby wranglers pick up babies in the crowd and then hand them off to the Clintons for what is supposed to be an innocent photo op. In reality, it&#39;s just a ploy to give the candidate the addictive high associated with baby pinching.   </p>

<p><br />
The words printed above the baby&#39;s head are obviously photo-shopped by some Clinton advisor onto the picture AFTER it was taken. Everyone knows that you can&#39;t see words that are being thought. </p>

<p><br />
PARODY WARNING: This is a parody. The preceding words are not true, unless, of course, there has been some remarkable coincidence. So, well, I guess the statements expressed herein are PROBABLY not true, but anything is impossible. For more information about baby pinching and how to prevent it, call 1-800-NO-PINCH. Confidential operators are standing by. </p>

OBAMA IN &#39;08 (He&#39;s no baby pincher)! </p>

(Not currently.) A slightly longer answer: I'm good at it. (When I do.) And another: I'm not good at anything else. The tenor of the debate elsewhere leads me to believe people will find these answers inadequate. There is truth in satisfaction, however, and when I teach, I feel intensely satisfied with myself as a human being. I could've gone into real estate appraisal—not kidding in the least—but I doubt helping people inflate or deflate the value of their current or future property would satisfy me the way teaching has. (Esp. considering what would have been my complicity in the sub-prime mortgage debacle. Better not to think about the attendant guilt that would've haunted me day and night had I had a part in that.) What do I find satisfying? The burgeoning awareness of theretofore unthinkable possibilities. In this respect, I side with Dr. Crazy against Kugelmass concerning statements like this: Expanding your world, or changing your view of the world, is not something I associate with becoming more likably bourgeois. One cannot expand into narrowness. Some have attributed this attitude to teaching at UCI, but I think the disagreement more intellectual, inasmuch as I think the path to financial independence in the United States still flows soundly through the middle class, and that the ability to appreciate the works Joe reads and teaches requires an amount of leisure time difficult to secure outside of the middle class. Not to say impossible—as Joe writes, students can cram thirty-eight hours a day into their weekendless weeks, but I don't think that situation ideal. Consider this in terms of scholarships and grants: the appearance of culture and strong writing skills can provide a student a quarter reprieve from what becomes a cycle of inevitable failure. Those devoted students who work full-time through college drop-out at a higher rate than those with scholarships; and those who slave through five rough years never experience the life-of-mind the same way their wealthier or financed classmates can. (Not that either of the latter group necessarily take advantage of this, only that they have an opportunity denied to those fully employed throughout their undergraduate career.) So if I can teach a student how to appear more culture, score a scholarship, and embrace the life-of-mind in a way they couldn't before, I might be making them more bourgeois, but I'm also (and more importantly) affording them the opportunity to become much more than that. Am I romanticizing the upper classes here? Certainly not. I'm speaking neither to nor of them. I'm talking about providing students with the tools required to reach the fringes of financial independence—not by aping the pretensions of imaginary middle class ideals, but (as Dr. Crazy wrote) to allow them to pass among its citizens and fool its gatekeepers. It is in this sense that I find teaching literature most subversive: all the supposedly indelible markers of class can be wiped from our souls with a little learning. Such are...</span></a></div>
