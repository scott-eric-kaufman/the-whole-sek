Now, the Imaginary is for Lacan the dimension of the human human psyche that permits us to feel more or less cohesive. It is the raw material of ego identity.

			<p>Scott McLemee, intellectual affairs columnist for www.insidehighered.com, asks <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/views/intellectual_affairs__11">&quot;What did Jacques Lacan mean by 'the Real'?&quot;</a>&nbsp; That question has as many answers as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0691017840/qid=1110471479/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-8289502-8607027?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">some people</a> have faces* ... and deserves to be taken as seriously as any question about a psychoanalytic work.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Taken not at all seriously.&nbsp; You can judge the seriousness of McLemee's seriously serious account of &quot;the Real&quot; for yourself:<br /><em></em></p><blockquote><p><em>What did Jacques Lacan mean by &quot;the Real&quot;? I found out, sort of, by walking across my apartment in search of a copy of the recent re-translation of his </em>Ecrits
-- <em>a volume replacing another (somewhat notoriously unreliable)
translation released by the same publisher more than 20 years earlier.</em></p>

<p><em>When a manufacturer of toasters finds out that its toasters are
defective, it will issue a recall. About halfway to the bookshelf, the
light bulb went off: Time for a class action suit!</em></p>

<p><em>Suddenly, a rogue housecat interposed himself between my feet --

<p><em>Now, the Imaginary is for Lacan the dimension of the human human

material of ego identity. By contrast, the Symbolic includes all the
systems we use for communication and exchange with others. It is
&quot;language,&quot; very broadly defined. But what about Lacan's third term?</em></p>

<p><em>Just to back up a little.... I'd been reading Slavoj Zizek, the wild

<p><em>Zizek refers to the Real &quot;escaping&quot; the Imaginary and &quot;errupting
into&quot; the Symbolic. Which is good to know, but not that helpful. It
left me wondering: &quot;OK, the Real -- what is it? And</em><em> where?&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>And then, out of nowhere, I got an answer. The Real is a silent but
(potentially) deadly housecat. The realm of the ego's Imaginary dignity
is violated. The order of the Symbolic is reduced to groans and

<p><em>Fredric Jameson, the lefty lit-crit guru maximus, once equated
Lacan's concept&nbsp; &nbsp; with the Marxist notion of History -- a word that

the Real, he explained, &quot;is what hurts.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>OK, but does that mean my cat embodies History? </em></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>

















<p>McLemee follows that with a brief discussion of the forthcoming <em>Zizek: The Movie</em>, in which, according to <a href="http://www.documentarycampaign.org/zizek.html">the official website</a>, &quot;Zizek never stops philosophizing.&quot;&nbsp; Not that one would expect anything less from &quot;the Elvis of cultural theory,&quot; a man for whom, according to Judith Butler, &quot;discussing Hegel and Lacan is like breathing.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>*A <a href="http://www.skepticfiles.org/atheist2/hero.htm">practical guide</a> to what Campbell called &quot;the monomyth&quot; outlines &quot;the stages of the HERO,&quot; and for some reason, it does so entirely in CAPS:</p>

<ol><li>THE HERO IS INTRODUCED IN HIS ORDINARY WORLD</li>

<li>THE CALL TO ADVENTURE</li>

<li>THE HERO IS RELUCTANT AT FIRST</li>

<li>THE HERO IS ENCOURAGED BY THE WISE OLD MAN OR WOMAN</li>

<li>THE HERO PASSES THE FIRST THRESHOLD</li>

<li>THE HERO ENCOUNTERS TESTS AND HELPERS</li>

<li>THE HERO REACHES THE INNERMOST CAVE</li>

<li>THE HERO ENDURES THE SUPREME ORDEAL</li>

<li>THE HERO SIEZES THE SWORD</li>

<li>THE ROAD BACK</li>

<li>RESURRECTION</li>

<li>RETURN WITH ELIXIR</li></ol>

<p>As with all psychoanalytically-informed theories--Campbell having been a devotee of Jung--this one need not be taken literally.&nbsp; The THE HERO SIEZES THE SWORD stage can, as in one variation of the Arthurian myth, consist of the hero siezing the sword, but &quot;sometimes the 'sword' is knowledge and experience that leads to greater understanding.&quot;&nbsp; In an irony Freudians no doubt appreciate, the &quot;sword&quot; may also be a woman with whom THE HERO has recently reconciled.&nbsp; That woman might, however, be a SHAPE-SHIFTER, and could therefore really be anyone.&nbsp; So the &quot;sword&quot; can be anything or anyone.&nbsp; Psychoanalytic theories rule!&nbsp; I can hear your complaints already, dear readers: &quot;Yes, A. Cephalous, psychoanalytic theories <em>seriously </em>rule, but what we really want to know is when will ZIZEK SIEZE THE SWORD?&quot;&nbsp; </p>

What I eventually came up with was - if you fall on the sidewalk, is what your hip is pressed against realer than the idea of concrete?  <br />
Granted, in my example, no cats were involved.</p>

<p>My own answer is yes.  Reality, in PK Dick&#39;s famous phrase, &quot;is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn&#39;t go away.&quot;</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/03/its_savory_scho.html"><span><strong>&quot;It's Savory Scholar-Squirrel Stew Time Again!&quot;</strong> I've appropriated that title from Gore Vidal's defense of Lincoln in The New York Review of Books, in which he defends his reconstruction of Lincoln's life from those academic biographers--in particular, Richard N. Current--who insist that Lincoln, his life, and his legacy belong to them. Vidal explains: How does a scholar differ from a scholar-squirrel? The squirrel is a careerist who mindlessly gathers little facts for professional reasons. I don't in the least mind this sort of welfare for the &quot;educated&quot; middle class. They must live, too. But when they start working in concert to revise history to suit new political necessities, I reach for my ancient Winchester...Current tells us that &quot;[Vidal] implied that he was a greater Lincoln authority than Stephen B. Oates or any other academic historian except David Herbert Donald.&quot; As I pointed out in the last exchange, it was Newsweek that found me to be (in reference to Lincoln's alleged syphilis) a better historian than Mr. Oates, whom I have never read. I do not &quot;imply&quot; (Current has a guardhouse lawyer's way with weasel-words) that I am a better historian than anyone. This is the sort of thing that obsesses academic careerists. Scholar-squirrels spend their lives trying to be noted and listed and graded and seeded because such rankings determine their careers. Those of us engaged in literature and, perhaps, in history as well don't think in such terms. We also don't go on Pulitzer Prize committees to give a friend a prize which, in due course, when he is on the committee, he will give us for our squirrelings. Despite his mixed anthropomoprhisms--&quot;scholar-squirrels&quot; have &quot;a guardhouse lawyer's ways with weasel-words&quot;--Vidal's point is sound: Academics often tussle over the scraps because they're trained to avoid the Big Picture. They prize their &quot;squirrelings&quot; because they can't, to slip into the most apt of cliches, see the forest for the trees. In which, I presume, the squirrel away their squirrelings. Vidal continues as only he can: But note the Current technique throughtout this supremely unimportant business. One of the signs of obsession is the inability to tell the difference between what mattters and what does not. The obsessed gives everything the same weight. Current juggles words this way and that to try to &quot;prove&quot; what is often pointless and unprovable. Not that Vidal is immune to criticism. To paraphrase someone who will find a response to his earnest and appreciated post to me in another forum, Alistair Alexi and Andy Appleton of the Alliteration Agency would like to speak to him about the following sentence: It's savory scholar-squirrel stew time again! Or, to be precise, one scholar-squirrel and one plump publicist pigeon for the pot. So no one's perfect. Tomorrow (or possibly even later this afternoon) will witness some brilliant thinkings about how painfully out-of-touch Tom Wolfe is and why that's related to the history of the shoe-fastening technology...</span></a></div>
