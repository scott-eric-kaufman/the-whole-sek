Yeats' &quot;The Second Coming&quot;:</p><blockquote><p>You need to study the poem as you rewatch the episode. It's not enought

there's going to be an all-out war between Tony and Phil. Or &quot;somewhere

<p>... with a law degree in one hand, a glass of wine in the other.&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>It's not enough
to say &quot;Things fall apart ... Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,&quot; so

<p>Because Tony and Phil are &quot;the world,&quot; like in the poem you studiously studied, in which &quot;things fall apart&quot; and on which &quot;anarchy is loosed.&quot;&nbsp; (Ann's absolutely right to ignore the &quot;mere.&quot;&nbsp; It's a useless poetry word poets throw in when they need an extra beat.)</p>

<p><em>Or &quot;somewhere

Bethlehem,&quot; so all that talk about the Mideast and terrorism is going

<p>Deserts and Bethlehem are <em>both </em>in the Middle East.&nbsp; (So is the Spiritus Mundi, for that matter.)<br /><em><br />There must be endless
depths there.</em> </p>

<p>Word.<br /><em><br />You're just getting started.</em></p>

<p>No, Ann, <em>you are</em>.&nbsp; I but bask in your reflected glory.&nbsp; <br /><em><br />Perhaps Tony will
find his humanity (or is he the &quot;rough beast&quot;?).</em>
</p>

<p>See how perfectly this aligns with Yeats' intent?&nbsp; Tony Soprano, small-time mobster, is exactly like the &quot;rough beast&quot; whose coming Yeats <em>celebrated </em>in the dark aftermath of the First World War.&nbsp; Who better to render judgment upon the citizens of New Jersey than Tony Soprano, a man who has been both rough <em>and </em>beastly?<br /><em><br />He saves his son from drowning.
(&quot;blood-dimmed tide... innocence is drowned.&quot;) The water imagery from
last week.</em> </p>

<p>What, you thought imagery the exclusive provenance of literary critics?&nbsp; As.&nbsp; If.&nbsp; Not only does she recognize it, she remembers where she recognizes it from.&nbsp; She let this imagery live in her head for <em>a whole week</em>.&nbsp; What it did in there is not for the likes of you or I to surmise.<br /><em><br />He cradles the son he saves. Mother imagery from last week.
</em></p>



<p>Do you see how much room she has in there?&nbsp; Water <em>and </em>mother imagery stayed with her.&nbsp; If you had that much imagery in your head <em>at one time</em>, you wouldn't be able to brush your teeth, much less write about <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/how-did-paula-abdul-break-her-nose.html"><em>American Idol</em></a>, <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/when-women-take-classes-in-tennis-wine.html">herself</a>, <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/everyones-using-on-line-dating-services.html">dating</a>, <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/audible-althouse-84.html">her theme song</a>, <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/its-not-kennedy-court-its-roberts-v.html">law</a>, <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/some-red-car-things.html">herself</a> and <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/05/american-idol-results-america-dont-take.html"><em>American Idol</em></a>.&nbsp; And yet:&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>Imagery carried
over from last week: mother, phallus, assassinated President.</em></p>

		<span id="comment-70377212-content"><p>Scott, thanks for the link. I was laughing out loud by the time we got here:</p>

<p><i>Because Tony and Phil are &quot;the world,&quot; like in the poem you studiously studied, in which &quot;things fall apart&quot; and on which &quot;anarchy is loosed.&quot;  (Ann&#39;s absolutely right to ignore the &quot;mere.&quot;  It&#39;s a useless poetry word poets throw in when they need an extra beat.)</i></p>

<p>How a useless &quot;reading&quot; of Yeats and the death knell of fiction can sit together on one blog, in the same month, is one of those imponderables that science may never be able to answer.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-70392732-content"><p>Ann,</p>

<p>If &quot;the Althouse Vortex&quot; is a place where a pleasurable half-hour can be spent mocking those in possession of an undeserved sense of superioty, not only am I there, I&#39;m thinking about buying some land and settling down.  </p>

<p>As for your question for me: it&#39;s <em>possible</em> you&#39;re claiming that the writers of a show you love are insanely over-literal readers of poetry, but I have my doubts.  There&#39;s no reason to praise a show you love by calling its writers idiots.  (At least, <em>I</em> wouldn&#39;t do so.)</p>

<p>Alex, </p>

<p>Nice save ... although I see that you don&#39;t actually <em>deny</em> watching <em>American Idol</em>.  (That said, there are many people I wouldn&#39;t watch <em>American Idol</em> with either.)</p>

<p>AWB, </p>

<p>You know, I thought about linking to that post of yours, but didn&#39;t want to suggest Ann had taken LSD, as that could lead to a lawsuit.</p></span>

Checking the tracked changes, I discover I'd already corrected this sentence, which earlier read: In a recently discovered essay he wrote upon returning from London, London ... Looking a little more carefully at the tracked changes, I learn the above was itself a revision: In a recently discovered essay London wrote upon returning from England ... I can see why I changed it to something dreadful and ungainly: England is not nearly specific enough. Had to specify London, lest someone get the impression he frolicked with other lily-white folk in Berwick-upon-Tweed. The lesson? No more arumfartzen with tracked changes.

The attendant told me that I'd been bumped to a later flight. I told them I was flying Southwest, but they didn't appear to be listening. They wanted me to sign something. I tried to explain the confusion. Finally, I walked away. (Tomorrow, this will be the topic of a &quot;You Finish the Post&quot; Contest, in which I narrate the first half of the conversation, and you provide the humorous esprit de l'escalier. I learned that I'll be sharing a panel with this guy and this guy come November. You should attend! I'll be the zebra sitting between them. Brad and I learned not to fear The Ogged, for The Ogged is a gentle soul who, when he cuts, does so politely. (And, despite being Iranian, only with words.) Speaking (again) of Brad, I might have been an economist if I'd had him as a professor. His quiet hilarity is a quality I gravitated toward as an undergraduate. Speaking of which—and this and the previous bullet will be verified when the podcast's published—Eric Rauchway is also much more soft-spoken and funny than I imagined. (His colleague, Ari Kelman, is equally funny, but not quite so quiet.) (Apologies for the double parenthetical, but I feel the need to add: I'm not trying to reconstruct what they said that was funny because you'll be able to witness it for yourself soon enough.) *Which I'll describe in more detail on a day which doesn't involve hours in airports and/or above California. **In today's bit of web-meta, when the podcast hits the 'Net, pay close attention to the Brad first scribbling, then typing as Tedra and I speak. Not only is he composing a post about a blogging panel during the panel itself, he's reenacting the very history of letters he discusses in his talk.</span></a></div>
