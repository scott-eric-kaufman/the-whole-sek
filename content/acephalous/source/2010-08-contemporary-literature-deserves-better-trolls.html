<p>This is the sort of thing you write when your book of short stories on a vanity press ( <a href="http://amzn.to/cFILeB" rel="nofollow">http://amzn.to/cFILeB</a> ) isn&#39;t getting any attention. You drum up some attention by beating on a drum and swearing loudly. </p>

<p>He&#39;s clearly wrong on Foer, Diaz, Lahiri. But what is the point of bringing up Jorie Graham, Sharon Olds, John Ashberry on a list that also has Amy Tan (who is not taken very seriously at all to begin with -- and not at all &quot;overrated&quot;)? It&#39;s simply incoherent. </p>

<p>If he were a Facebook Friend, I would unfriend him.<br />
If I were Twitter&#39;s God, I would untrend him. </p></span>

<p>He was a self-professed child of surrealism, and not closely associated with the school of confessional poetry (unless, as may have happened with Shivani, you confuse him John <em>Berryman</em>).  </p>

<p><em>If Ashbery was so terrible, why would anyone have imitated him?</em></p>

<p>The dictators who run MFA programs, according to the article.</p>

<p><em>He&#39;s clearly wrong on Foer, Diaz, Lahiri. But what is the point of bringing up Jorie Graham, Sharon Olds, John Ashberry on a list that also has Amy Tan (who is not taken very seriously at all to begin with -- and not at all &quot;overrated&quot;)?</em></p>

<p>Hit the high-brow, hit the low-brow, and maybe someone will assume your work is in between?  Wait, let me look at that link again ... </p>

<blockquote>In these eleven stories of novelistic breadth and ambition, global tensions and harmonies come alive as rarely seen in contemporary fiction.</blockquote>

<p>So as it turns out, <em>no</em>.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01348625c474970c-content"><p>I actually think this piece is quite spot on.</p>

<p>If you actually read Shivani&#39;s take on Ashbery, you&#39;ll see (a) he compares him unfavorably to Berryman, who he says, quite rightly, is more a truly visionary poet than Ashbery (and here he&#39;s going after Harold Bloom&#39;s and Helen Vendler&#39;s very popular notion that Ammons and Ashbery are the visionary heirs to the throne of Whitman), and (b) Shivani likes Ashbery&#39;s earlier work and quite rightly argues that Ashbery has been writing the same poem for 30 years.  </p>

<p>He goes after Amy Tan as a representative of a certain kind of very popular multiculturalism in which nothing&#39;s at stake.  His take on Tan, like his take on Olds and Gluck, suggest a coherent critical stance: all three pose as social or political voices of the minority or the voiceless, but all three exploit politics while taking no risks or making anyone feel terribly uncomfortable with themselves.  </p>

<p>Now, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d have gone after Tan.  Maxine Hong Kingston or Leslie Silko is probably a better example of this phenomenon, &#39;tho Silko at least pretends to take a radical poliical stance even as she markets her work to white middle class female book clubs.</p>

<p>He&#39;s spot on about Jorie Graham.  Her first three or four books are excellent, but since *Regions of Unlikeness*, she has crawled up her own asshole, equating the loss of her dog to the Holocaust and ultimately assuming that every piece of content of her consciousness is equivalent.  This is what Shivani means when he criticizes her faux-philosophical poetry.</p>

<p>As far as Foer goes, sure, it&#39;s not the most pretentious magical realist novel, but it&#39;s probably the most overrated pretentious magical realist novel. </p>

<p>Back to Ashbery -- you&#39;re misreading what he means by turning poetry into a hermetic, self-enclosed private affair.  He&#39;s not talking about vanity or self-centeredness (which he attacks in Louise Gluck).  He&#39;s talking about the transformation of poetry into a self-enclosed block of non-referential language.  And here again he&#39;s completely right.  Ashbery is not the only influence, but he&#39;s the most popular, the one that has given the most license to young poets to write such verse.  And again, since *The Tennis Court Oath*, Ashbery hasn&#39;t taken any artistic risks, leaving it up to the next generation of Language Poets to suffer stupid attacks on their poetry while he finds crossover success in the mainstream (especially as his poetry backed down from the radical fragmentation of the *Oath* and he found a kind of airbrushed sheen for his parataxis. </p></span>

<p>It was the &quot;utterly private&quot; bit that sent me unthralling to the confessional poets, but I can see how that&#39;d be applicable to someone like Ashbery too (though I never find him as willfully private as, say, Plath&#39;s references to Nazis).</p>

<p>GeoX:</p>

<p>It&#39;s difficult to tell with outfits that encourage submissions, run contests you have to pay to participate in, and highly recommend you purchase multiple copies of your own book from them.  I say that seriously: smaller outfits have been forced into the sort of gimmickry that once was limited to tried-and-true vanity, or outright scam presses.</p>

<p>Matthew:</p>

<p>If he&#39;d actually written this:</p>

<blockquote>If you actually read Shivani&#39;s take on Ashbery, you&#39;ll see (a) he compares him unfavorably to Berryman, who he says, quite rightly, is more a truly visionary poet than Ashbery (and here he&#39;s going after Harold Bloom&#39;s and Helen Vendler&#39;s very popular notion that Ammons and Ashbery are the visionary heirs to the throne of Whitman), and (b) Shivani likes Ashbery&#39;s earlier work and quite rightly argues that Ashbery has been writing the same poem for 30 years.</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d see something more than a subjective assessment at work there.  But then he writes, about Vollmann:</p>

<blockquote>Encapsulates ethical vacuity of American fiction after the collapse of 1970s postmodernism.</blockquote>

<p>Because when I think of the <em>Seven Dreams</em> series&#39;s brutal critique of clash of civilizations that was the repopulating of the North American continent by white people, the first words that come to mind are &quot;ethical vacuity.&quot;  It&#39;s the sorta thing you might say about Vollmann if you&#39;ve only ever read about him.  He&#39;s one of the most troubled and problematic novelists/journalists of the past half-century, but to claim that his ethics are vacuous is akin to dismissing the power of <em>Light in August</em> because of how Faulkner struggles with his own racism therein.</p>

<p>James and Sean:</p>

<p>I am, apparently, not a percenter at all (nor do I want to be).</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f306952b970b-content"><p>In general, it&#39;s really frustrating that people who write about authors being &quot;overrated&quot; tend to pay no attention to how they are, in fact, rated by mainstream critics. I mean Amy Tan is very widely thought of as an overly sappy middlebrow novelist, no? I&#39;ve never read her, so I can&#39;t comment on the accuracy of that assessment, but it&#39;s ridiculous to pretend that Shivani&#39;s position is a daring, revolutionary one. Similarly, unqualified praise of Vollmann is pretty rare, and Shivani is far from the first person to point out that his books are rather long and dense.</p>

<p>Going back to your first point in the post, calling someone a &quot;writer&quot; reminds me of the History Channel&#39;s habit, when discussing Nostradamus or ancient astronauts or similar infuriating crap, of interviewing people who are identified below their names with credentials such as &quot;author&quot; or &quot;Nostradamus expert,&quot; when they might as well just come out and say &quot;crackpot.&quot;</p></span>

(It's technically &quot;American anime.&quot;) I chose the penultimate episode, &quot;The Ember Island Players,&quot; because it 1) requires almost no knowledge of the series to understand and 2) it performs the show's fraught relation to its Japanese forebears. I'll tackle the first item today, the second tomorrow. Before I continue, I'll add the same caveat I have to all these analyses designed for freshmen-level composition courses: they're designed for freshmen-level composition courses.* I'm attempting to model engaged cultural criticism for students who consider culture something to be passively consumed, i.e. I provide the tools then teach them how to construct a persuasive rhetorical argument.** On with the show: &quot;The Ember Island Players&quot; requires little knowledge of the series because it consists of the main characters watching a play that recapitulates it. All I need to tell the two students who haven't already seen every episode is that the kids are about to go to war with the Fire Nation, and that this play (as the title of the episode indicates) is being produced by a Fire Nation theater troupe. As soon as Sokka—the Zeppo of this crew—discovers the poster, the difference between the kids: And their on-stage equivalents becomes clear: Sokka and his sister, Katara, are being played by adults, and Aang, the titular Airbender, by a woman. The episode is as committed to verisimilitude (or a realistic representation the series' established aesthetic) as the average Elizabethean drama in which the women were portrayed by young boys and the young boys were portrayed by old men. Just as with all theater—and by extension, all animated representations of it—the act of suspending disbelief is a wilfull one, a fact which &quot;The Ember Island Players&quot; takes pains to foreground. To wit: That would be curtain rising in the theater to reveal a highly stylized (ahem) representation of the first event in the series: Sokka and Katara on the verge of discovering Aang frozen in a block of ice. Note that the backdrop is clearly attached to a batten (its top is visible even when staring the stage straight on) and that the lighting above is purely functional (intended merely to illuminate the scene in a way that &quot;suggests&quot; the time of day). The stage is framed like a television, calling attention to the unreality of the events depicted on it; but it's framed like a television on a television, which should (but often doesn't) call attention to the unreality of the events depicted on it. (Especially when they're animated.) Director Giancarlo Volpe has created a complex narrative situation that is simple enough for a child to decode. (Which is partly the point of recapitulating the narrative arc of a complex show aimed at children whose memory for nuances may yet be underdeveloped.) Not only is the viewer constantly aware that the on-stage narrative is constructed, Volpe...</span></a></div>
