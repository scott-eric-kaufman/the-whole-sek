			<p>I meant to post last night, but by the time I got back from buying cat food at Albertson's I felt run down.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Like I'd been hit by a truck.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Or an enthusiastically riced Honda Civic.&nbsp; Like<a href="http://www.geocities.com/zimzorga/jaymes_cameron_reilly5.JPG"> this one</a>.&nbsp; Only darker. <br /> </p>



<p>Its owner revved its engine and backed out at 90.&nbsp; I placed my right hand on its unnecessary spoiler, pushed myself into the air, slammed into the back windshield, then its owner threw it into drive and I rolled off the back windshield and onto the parking lot.&nbsp; I heard it gun its engines and watched it drive away.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I was still clutching the bag of cat food.&nbsp; <br /> </p>

<p>My iRiver was still in my pocket, but I could neither feel nor find my headphones.</p>

<p>A kind man dropped his groceries and ran to me and asked if I needed any help.&nbsp; </p>

<p>He said, &quot;Do you need any help?&quot;</p>

<p>I said, &quot;I don't think so.&quot;</p>

<p>He said, &quot;I didn't catch the license number.&quot;</p>

<p>I said, &quot;Me neither.&quot;</p>

<p>He said, &quot;Are you sure you're alright?&nbsp; Do you need a lift?&quot;</p>

<p>I said, &quot;No, I live right up there.&quot;</p>

<p>Then I walked home.&nbsp; I felt my heart pounding through my shoulder.&nbsp; I climbed three flights of stairs.&nbsp; It was fun.&nbsp; I opened the door and put the bag of cat food in the tin.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I poured and drank a stiff drink.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I walked into the Little Womedievalist's office and informed her I'd sort of been hit by a car in the parking lot.</p>

<p>I said, &quot;I was sort of hit by a car in the parking lot.&quot;</p>

<p>She said, &quot;Are you alright?&quot;</p>

<p>I said, &quot;The man asked that too.&nbsp; I was fine then but I feel sort of strange now.&quot;</p>

<p>She said, &quot;What do you mean 'sort of strange'?&quot;</p>

<p>I said, &quot;Like I don't know.&quot;</p>

<p>She said, &quot;We should call someone.&quot;</p>

<p>I called Albertson's and asked if they had cameras pointed in the parking lot.&nbsp; The woman on the phone said they didn't because the parking lot belonged to the Irvine Company.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I called the Irvine Company.&nbsp; The message said, &quot;Business hours had ended.&quot;&nbsp; I hung up and called back.&nbsp; I listened to the message again.&nbsp; I wrote down the number of the private security company Irvine employees to watch over Albertson's parking lot.&nbsp; I called them.&nbsp; The dispatcher informed me that she was only a dispatcher and didn't know if there were cameras.&nbsp; She said their security guard left at 7 p.m. and wouldn't return until 3 p.m. on Saturday.&nbsp; She recommended I call the police.</p>

<p>I called the police station next to my apartment complex.&nbsp; I told the officer what happened.&nbsp; He said I needed to call the Irvine police because Albertson's is across the street.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I called the Irvine police.&nbsp; They said they would send someone out.&nbsp; I brushed my teeth and calmed the wife.&nbsp; I began to feel sort of stranger in my lower back.&nbsp; I sat down on the couch with excellent posture and watched Pedro lose it in the bottom of the seventh.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The doorbell rang.&nbsp; An earnest young officer took my statement.&nbsp; She asked polite questions.&nbsp; Said she would have someone look into it in the morning.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Said the important thing was I wasn't hurt.&nbsp; </p>

<p>That the odds of catching the motorist were slim.&nbsp; </p>

<p>That she and the civilian with her had been in Starbuck's around eight.&nbsp; </p>

<p>That she or someone else would be back in touch sometime Saturday.&nbsp; I went back inside.&nbsp; Proceeded to freak out.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Use profanity.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Feel sort of even stranger in my lower back.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Which then tried to implode.&nbsp; Like when things wink out in cartoons.&nbsp; I had offended it and it punished me by trying to make me touch my toes backwards.&nbsp; I retaliated by depriving it of oxygen.&nbsp; I took short breaths.&nbsp; I failed to inflate my lungs.&nbsp; I became light-headed.&nbsp; I refused to stand up.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I bent over forward in defiance.&nbsp; It defied my defiance.&nbsp; I defied its.&nbsp; Modern medicine prevailed.&nbsp; I took a strong muscle relaxer and slept on the hard living room floor.&nbsp; </p>

<p>All this I did and said and had done to me and that is why I didn't post anything new on my blog last night.</p>

		<span id="comment-17849100-content"><p>No nagging necessary, as I plan on returning to the friendly confines of Gottschalk on Tuesday afternoon.  I&#39;m fine, if a bit sedate, er, <i>sedated</i> at the moment.  I have some soma-induced philosophical meditations to share, but I&#39;ll probably keep &#39;em to myself, as they&#39;re, well, soma-induced.  But yes, after two evenings sleeping on the living room floor, my back feels a little better, but I&#39;m still not very mobile, and I still can&#39;t twist.  I can, however, read some comics gifted to me some months back, and have had the terrible realization that some comics I thought were smart are only so in memory, <i>i.e.</i> after I unconsciously eighty-six the suck.  </p>

<p>As for the police situation, I think Belle&#39;s right, that I&#39;ll have to settle for cosmic justice.  On Friday, I floated some pleasant scenarios: the motorist was slightly tipsy--there are two bars in the strip mall perpendicular to Albertson&#39;s--hit me, took off and is now wracked with guilt at the thought that they may&#39;ve done me some serious damage.  They&#39;ll canvas the stores, but no one will know anything.  For the rest of their lives, they&#39;ll wonder if they are, in fact, a murderer/murderess.  Maybe I did a little damage to their car, or that I got their license plate, and they&#39;ll flip out and spend hundreds of dollars to fix a little cosmetic damage, or repaint the entire car, or sell it at a lose and buy themselves some cheap replacement, which--their karma being what it is--immediately reveals itself to be a lemon, and leaves them stranded on the way to an important meeting, or Vegas, or the party at which they would&#39;ve met the <i>one and only person in the universe they&#39;ll ever be happy with</i>.  I could continue in this awesome vein, but I don&#39;t want people to think me bitter loopy.</p></span>

Both albums—Paul Simon's Surprise and the Dixie Chicks' Taking the Long Way—boast producers who have what is called &quot;indie cred.&quot; At the helm of Simon's Surprise is the esteemed Brian Peter George St. Baptiste de la Salle Eno. With the same deft hand responsible for such influential albums as Another Green World and The Microsoft Sound, Eno updates Simon's sound for a new generation of listeners. According to Simon, &quot;I haven't sounded this fresh in since Graceland. I owe that entirely to Brian. His creepy atmospherics are the perfect counterbalance to my tendency to indulge in musical traditions I'm not altogether familiar with.&quot; At Amoeba Records in Los Angeles, a man in his late-twenties was seen clutching Surprise to a t-shirt celebrating Pavement's 1994 tour in support of Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain. &quot;I like Brian Eno,&quot; he said. &quot;You going to use my name in this? 'Cause my girlfriend would flip. But seriously, listen to the 'How Can You Live in the Northeast' or 'Everything About It Is a Love Song' and tell me that's not classic Eno.&quot; &quot;They should have started collaborating in the Seventies,&quot; said another Amoeba patron. &quot;The lyrics even have that corny Seventies environmentalist thing going on. I can almost see that indian tear up when I listen to it.&quot; The same cannot be said for the new Dixie Chicks album. &quot;The Seventies?&quot; asked one of the legion of Atrios readers who pre-purchased the album. &quot;More like the mid-Nineties. They brought in members of Semisonic, the Jayhawks, and got Rick Rubin to produce. So long as they hate Bush and it don't sound like the Dixie Chicks, it'll be awesome.&quot; Rubin has acquired a reputation for transforming marginal acts into popular crossover sensations. He has worked with everyone from L.L. Cool J., the Beastie Boys, Rage Against the Machine, System of a Down, Johnny Cash, Weezer and the Mars Volta. He decided to work with the Dixie Chicks for the challenge. &quot;People thought I wouldn't be able to re-mainstream Neil Diamond, but you've seen Saving Silverman, right? Have you heard Johnny Cash's 'Hurt'? Has anyone ever covered a song better? Have you ever seen a better video? People expect me to perform miracles.&quot; According to that guy over there in the beaten Chuck Taylors and fashionably weathered jeans, he just may have succeeded. &quot;You can actually hear Gary Louris on four of the songs. And the harmonies are sort of pretty sometimes. What's this in my hand you ask? The latest TV on the Radio album. Heard of them? Didn't think so. I'm still cool. Stop laughing.&quot; Gary Louris does sing harmony on &quot;Everybody Knows.&quot; Given Rubin's penchant for trenchant covers, one would expect it to be a cover of Leonard Cohen's immortal &quot;Everybody Knows.&quot; Or Concrete Blonde's incredible cover of Cohen's tune from Pump Up the...</span></a></div>

Sure he fought the good fight once or twice. But did he do so out of conviction? Pffft. He did so because he couldn't sorbonne America until he conquered Antartica and established a homeland for Theorists. After the Soamenals destroyed Thenosha his mental state deteriorated considerably. He would deconstruct his alarm clocks with the same indifferent aplomb with which he deconstructed his lovers. Eventually he awoke in a room with no meaning at the white heart center of a sun not unlike our own. Content with the divine deconstruction of hydrogen swirling around him, Jacqneto let his eyelids fall to better await the day of his fiery rebirth. Proof? What do you mean &quot;proof&quot;? Of course I have proof. See? So I'm sure y'all can do better than me in those bubbles or the origin story, if only because (to my knowledge) none of you have had to decide between pain-with-every-movement or the-intellection-of-the-average-comic-book-reader. (Lest any of y'all complain that I misunderestimate the intelligence of those who read comic books, I'm slagging the average reader of comic books. The fact that you read this blog proves you ain't average. I guarantee that you can't understand a damn word I write if you're not in at least the 51st percentile.) If you're only familiar with the older Derrida, I urge you to check out some photos from his dashing youth before you mock me for my Jacqneto.</span></a></div>
