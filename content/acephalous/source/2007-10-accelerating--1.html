		<span id="comment-85519958-content"><p>I think there&#39;s a subset of essay-readers who don&#39;t deserve the opprobium you&#39;ve assigned them: newbies. I know that I, when I started doing conferences, read mostly shorter essays, rather than fluent presentations. I&#39;d never seen conference presentations that did anything else -- and for a few conferences, even though I went to a lot of panels, I didn&#39;t see anything that really challenged that model of conferences. </p>

<p>I agree that conference presentations need to be different than essays, but I also know that an awful lot of graduate advisors let students get away with reading essays in seminars, don&#39;t let students get a lot of teaching experience (especially lecture experience), and don&#39;t really supervise their conference presentations as such. </p></span>

Just post each panel&#39;s papers on a conference blog and save the f2f conference time for discussion, first among the panelists, and then with the audience.  Then everyone can take it to the comments area on the panel post.  S my perfect conference would be:</p>

<p>1.  arrive Friday evening for dinner and drinking, having read conference papers in your free time since they were posted on Monday of that week;<br />
2.  have discussions in panels on Saturday, freeing time for more <br />
3.  dinner and drinking Saturday night<br />
4.  and breakfast/brunch recovery/continued discussion before<br />
5.  departure mid-day Sunday<br />
6.  and continued bloggy commenting for another week, at which point comments are closed and the conference is over.</p></span>

I thought about what you said about creative commons licensing, and that makes sense. But do you worry sometimes about putting your ideas out there too soon? I suppose there&#39;s an understanding that stuff put on blogs is necessarily in the rough.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I did a very good job of revising my diss chapter into a talk. I made it shorter, but that&#39;s about it.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-85671902-content"><p>You know, I&#39;ll say this, though: I&#39;d rather have a person read an essay and keep to time than give a talk and rudely go on and on, however entertaining the person might be.  It may not be intellectual vanity that drives those who read their papers but rather, in contrast to your point, courtesy.  I agree that a conference paper is a very different animal from an essay that one publishes, and ideally one should have the fact that people are listening and not able to reread dense sections in mind when one prepares to speak at a conference.  But speaking for myself, if I don&#39;t read, I will go on and on, and that&#39;s not fair to those on my panel or, ultimately, to the audience who shows up.</p></span>

<p>That&#39;s a fine point, but certainly they&#39;ve attended enough lectures to be able to tell the difference between those which consist of essays-read-aloud and those which were intended to be talks. </p>

<p>Constructivist: </p>

<p>I&#39;ll comment more on that in a day or two, as it&#39;s the heart of this week&#39;s talk in Chicago.</p>

<p>Middlebrow:</p>

<p><em>But do you worry sometimes about putting your ideas out there too soon? I suppose there&#39;s an understanding that stuff put on blogs is necessarily in the rough.</em></p>

<p>The thing is, you&#39;re already putting your ideas out there at the conference.  Were someone in the audience to have little-to-no integrity, they could abscond with your idea and you&#39;ve have little-to-no way to prove ownership of it.  This way, the idea&#39;s mine.  It&#39;s been date-stamped, everyone knows what I said and when I said it.  There are other advantages to:</p>

<p>The random Googler who stumbles upon your work, finds it interesting, contacts you, asks you to present/co-write/edit/&amp;c.  This has happened to me a few times already, and I hope it happens many, many more.  (Who wants me?  I&#39;m cheap?  And, per the most recent post, cuddly too.)</p>

<p>Dr. Crazy: </p>

<p>That makes a lot of sense, actually.  I free-wheel through class, and could continue free-wheeling indefinitely.  But that&#39;s not quite what I&#39;m getting at here.  As you say:</p>

<p><em>ideally one should have the fact that people are listening and not able to reread dense sections in mind when one prepares to speak at a conference</em></p>

<p>This is much more along the lines of what I&#39;m talking about: reading from a text prepared with the intent to deliver it to a room full of people, very few of whom have eidetic memories.  (Quite possibly, none of them do.)  But yes, you&#39;re correct, the last thing anyone wants is to give me license to prattle on and on, because I&#39;ll use it ... which is also bad for me, because not only do I offend the audience and my fellow panelists, but the longer I blather, the more likely I am to say something uproariously stupid.</p>

<p>I should add: this weekend&#39;s conference was blessedly free of essays-read-aloud.</p></span>

(More on the them momentarily.) I'm discussing 19th century evolutionary theory with two extremely bright graduate students and a number of professors. We're discussing our work, and I'm enjoying not having to explain everything for once—I say Haeckel, they think ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny; they say Weissman, I think de-tailed lizards—and the experience is beautiful. (To return to the previous metaphor: you shag the final out and you're jogging back to the bench, faking punches, slapping asses, feeling camaraderie.) Only there's this feeling. This recognizable feeling. This familiar feeling. But sitting at this table, having this discussion, I can't place it. So I ignore it. This annoys it. It escalates its campaign from gentle prod to vigorous tap. This fails. It soldiers on. Only when ankle kicks turn to body blows do I pay it the attention it desperately seeks: &quot;Who are you?&quot; I ask. &quot;You should be working on your dissertation,&quot; it responds. I hate it. I really, really hate it.</span></a></div>
