I don't share the qualms Timothy Burke and his commenters are expressing over the continuity issues raised by the film, because I care more about quality than continuity. Moreover, I think what Abrams did there was damn clever. (If you ain't seen the film but will this is where you should stop reading.) As every critic has said, the casting was inspired. We didn't see Chris Pine playing Shatner playing Kirk or Zachary Quinto playing Nimoy playing Spock; moreover, the ensemble cast related to each other in a manner consistent with the original. I think this is a testament to J.J. Abrams, who has proven, again and again, to have a deft touch with ensembles: Alias, Lost, Fringe. Even when the stories break down into nonsense, the interaction of his characters remain a compelling reason to keep watching. (Or so I tell myself for sticking with Alias two years longer than any sane man should.) Why am I talking about the cast when I said I'd be talking about continuity? Because this cast had the task of replacing icons. There can always be another Bond or Batman. But another Kirk or Spock? You need to do more than cast a Spock-alike to convince an audience for whom Nimoy is Spock that Quinto can fill the role. Which isn't to say Quinto doesn't look like a young Leonard Nimoy at times. Because he does. Frighteningly so. But looking like Nimoy isn't the same thing as being Spock. So what did Abrams do? He made himself another Spock. The Spock who witnessed a Genocide Effect and may never stare down the Genesis Device. Who knows what the future holds for this Spock? No one . . . all the old stories belong to the crews of different Enterprises exploring a different universe. By introducing a new timeline, Abrams need neither bend nor buckle under the burden of history. Fans of the original continuity keep what they have (mostly) intact, whereas new fans—charmed by the new cast and new direction—are introduced to the franchise via a plot contrivance that allows them to understand why all the previous series and films seem to exist in a different universe. By making the breaking of the continuity the central plot point of the first reboot, Abrams ensures that new fans won't be confused when they hear, for example, that Kirk had a long and healthy relationship with his father. This strikes me as a genius move." />

<p>But I&#39;m not sure what that&#39;s worth. Salon&#39;s Andrew O&#39;Heir argues for the <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/btm/feature/2009/05/13/star_trek_original/" rel="nofollow">original series</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Even if some of its flaws look more glaring 30-odd years later, I think the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; still has a passion and vitality that partly stem from its cheapness; the threadbare sets and effects created a coherent, suggestive atmosphere, and forced your attention onto the storytelling and the characters. It stands out, even after all this time, as something unique in television history. Of course &quot;Star Trek&quot; can never be the cultural lodestone it once was. Having spawned four official follow-up series, 11 feature films (and counting) and countless non-canonical works -- if you haven&#39;t heard about K/S porn or the immense and disputatious fanfic universe, I&#39;m not helping you -- and inspired an entire genre of serial intergalactic futurism from &quot;Space: 1999&quot; to &quot;Babylon 5&quot; to &quot;Battlestar Galactica,&quot; the novelty of Gene Roddenberry&#39;s creation has pretty well worn off.</p>

<p>In the middle of the Cold War, Roddenberry imagined a radical-progressive, Enlightenment-fueled vision of the human future, one in which the conflict between capitalism and communism had been long transcended, along with other earthbound forms of racial, ethnic or religious strife. Strikingly, there is no religious or mystical dimension to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe at all, at least until much later in its development.<br />

<blockquote><br />
“Star Trek” was shot for Desilu Productions, on the lot its founders, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, bought from RKO Radio Pictures, the prolific studio that had made “King Kong,” “Citizen Kane,” the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musicals and countless B pictures like “I Walked With a Zombie.” In time, the series moved to Paramount and if it seemed as though Kirk and his crew were venturing from old movie to old movie, Roddenberry and his crew were traveling literally from old-movie set to old-movie set.</p>

<p>“The majority of story premises ...can be accomplished on such common studio back lot locales and sets such as Early 1900 Street, Oriental Village, Cowtown, Border Fort, Victorian Drawing Room, Forest and Streamside,” wrote Roddenberry in his original pitch. “Interiors and exteriors temporarily available after an ‘Egyptian’ motion picture, a ‘horror’ epic, or even an unusual telefilm, could be used to meet the needs of a number of story premises.”</p>

<p>The creative re-use of studio sets may have begun as a way to keep costs down. But the show made a kind of loopy pastiche pulp art by appropriating, referencing and recombining ideas from film history, going imaginatively — and, yes, even boldly — where many had gone before.<br />
</blockquote><br />
Ideas and ideals vs. inexpensive production &amp; recycling of cliches, which is it? It&#39;s not a fatal opposition; you can have both. But still, it&#39;s a different combo than big budget and space opera.</p>

<p>[Sorry about two posts. It&#39;s difficult to get the webnets to cooperate.]</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef011570855805970b-content"><p>I am more torn about the new Star Trek than any movie I have seen in a long time.  I&#39;m not a Star Trek nerd, I grew up watching TNG and rolling my eyes at how inescapably dorky it was, though of course I still watched it every week.</p>

<p>I felt like this movie took the things I didn&#39;t like about Star Trek and turned them into awesome things.  All the dorkiness has been transmogrified* into coolness.  The &quot;reboot factor&quot; wherein things we are used to are presented to us in a different form, is handled extremely well.  As you say, the casting is perfect, the crew dynamic is great (if a little exaggerated) and the universe is right.   </p>

<p>But I also felt like other than that, it was manifestly a stupid movie.  The reboot factor makes it interesting to watch, and there&#39;s no shortage of action.  But a lot of stupid action movie things happen.  People are constantly hanging off cliffs.  Explosions engulf starships for seconds before the starship bursts through.  There are also just a lot of weird plot moments and goofy gimmicks.  The whole &quot;kirk has an alien virus&quot; thing was silly and the sequence of events that led to him being on the ship and becoming captain felt a little to &quot;put all our faith in this plucky kid&quot; to me.  A big bad monster is eaten by a bigger badder monster.  Nimoy&#39;s narration was weird: &quot;Something bad was going to happen so we tried to prevent it but then the <i>unthinkable</i> happened: <i>the bad thing happened anyway</i>.&quot;  Scotty in the water tubes was an eyerolling gag.  And also scotty shows up on the enterprise, having never seen the ship before, and is head of engineering like fifteen minutes later?<br />
I think that much of the substance of the movie is how weird it is to see all these young folks playing Trek characters.  What was done right was the setup that allows new and hopefully old Trek fans to get into the rebooted setting.  I hear they&#39;re planning a sequel, I&#39;m excited to see if they take it someplace that is less filled with action movie cliches.</p>

<p>* I want you all to know that firefox&#39;s spell check recognizes &quot;transmogrified&quot; but not &quot;neuroscience&quot;.</p></span>

<p>I really, really find that bit about them recycling film sets interesting.  There&#39;d be a sort of built-in deja vu effect for those in the know, but that&#39;s not the best part: think about what&#39;s involved in creating a vision of utopian futures via the detritus of the sordid past, i.e. it&#39;s a literal reshaping of the whole of human history from ancient Egypt to the Old West.  I&#39;ll need to think about that one some more.</p>

<p>J.S., </p>

<p>But I also felt like other than that, it was manifestly a stupid movie. The reboot factor makes it interesting to watch, and there&#39;s no shortage of action. But a lot of stupid action movie things happen. People are constantly hanging off cliffs.</p>

<p>The wife and I had planned to see it in IMAX, but the projector had broken, and it&#39;s a good thing: this scared me witless, so I can only imagine what all those people whose cliff-hanging almost made me wet myself would&#39;ve done on the IMAX.  (shudders)  But all the other stuff you listed was, well, silly . . . but it was done so well.  The bloated hands/tongue gag was slapstick, but it was well-executed slapstick.  </p>

<p>I think that much of the substance of the movie is how weird it is to see all these young folks playing Trek characters.</p>

<p>The ensemble cast pulled off bemused consternation so well you think they&#39;d been working together for years, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s simply a matter of seeing other people play Kirk and Spock.  They seemed comfortable in their roles . . . with the exception of Bones in the middle of the film, which is odd: early was fine, late was fine, but the middle was a mess, which leads me to believe I can intuit something about the shooting schedule, but I probably shouldn&#39;t.</p></span>

Using the well-worn Star Trek gimmick of time travel, they would establish a new universe for the old characters to play in—while preserving the adventures of Gene Roddenberry’s original series in their own time line. Orci and Kurtzman wrote Star Trek and the season finale and the season finale of Fringe. Not only did both feature a Leonard Nimoy cameo, both relied on the same narrative device to introduce him into the plot: contiguous universes and the ability to travel between them. (Here there be spoilers.) Brief synopsis: Two Harvard lab partners (John Noble's Walter Bishop and Leonard Nimoy's before-this-episode unseen-but-frequently-mentioned William Bell) experiment on children and give them the ability to locate the weak points between contiguous universes. They also devise a means of traveling between these universes. Walter Bishop accidentally kills an assistant and loses his mind. Couple of decades of institutionalization follow. His son Peter (Joshua Jackson) eventually coaxes him out of the asylum and into the employ of the FBI. By this time William Bell has become the CEO of a very successful company called Massive Dynamic. The Bishops wrestle with events ranging from improbable and impossible. These events are directly and indirectly connected to Massive Dynamic. The season finale revisits a character with the ability to teleport (Jared Harris' chilling David Robert Jones), only now he seems to be able to throw open the barn door between continguous universes. Looks like this: As the episode opens he drives a truck through one of those and shoots people. The Bishops and the FBI track Jones to a lake house they once visited before Walter's institutionalization. They are told that Walter once lost some precious thing there that is crucial to stopping Jones from popping back and forth between realities. Walter cannot remember what that is but makes an offhand remark that the last time he and Peter were in that lake house Peter was very sick. Peter responds, &quot;I don't remember being very sick.&quot; Why not? Because as we learn when Walter goes to the cemetary Peter died when he was seven years old. That would be the precious thing Walter lost the last time he went to the lake house. Then who is the Peter Bishop who hasn't been dead the past quarter century? Best I can figure, he is a Peter Bishop from a contiguous universe who was kidnapped by Walter sometime after his Peter died. (Thus answering in the oddest way possible the eternal custodial question of whether you can kidnap your own children.) How can I be sure? Because we finally get a glimpse of another America when the Bishops' FBI liaison Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) is stood up by William Bell. As she leaves the...</span></a></div>
