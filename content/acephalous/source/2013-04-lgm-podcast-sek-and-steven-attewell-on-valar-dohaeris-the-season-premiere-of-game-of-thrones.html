But who? Where? To what end?</strong> (It goes without saying that this is one those visual rhetoric posts.) The title of the third season premier of Game of Thrones comes from the traditional Braavosi exchange: one meets the chipper greeting, &quot;Valar Morghulis [all men must die]&quot; with the equally cheery response, &quot;Valar Dohaeris [all men must serve].&quot; Given that the last episode of the second season was named &quot;Valar Morghulis&quot; and the first episode of the third season is &quot;Valar Dohaeris,&quot; it seems sensible to consider these two episodes together because they are, if only ritually, conversing with each other. What are they saying? &quot;Valar Morghulis&quot; would be saying &quot;I may not be a liar, but I'm not telling the whole truth,&quot; because the episode's final shots demonstrate that all men must die except for the ones that don't stay dead: Combine that with the man who was Jaqen H'ghar becoming another man after advising Arya and it becomes clear that the certitude of the Braavosi greeting is a comforting ruse. All men must not be anything—not absolutely—if they can also be both one thing and another. What can change its face isn't a man and what can't stay dead can't be trusted. Meaning I'm not sure how much I want to invest in &quot;Valar Morghulis&quot; as a title tied to its theme; in &quot;Valar Dohaeris,&quot; however, the theme that &quot;all men must serve&quot; manifests repeatedly, beginning with the opening sequence. This sequence ties the two episodes together almost comically, as the change in scale from the first two close-ups (from &quot;Valar Morghulis&quot;) to the extreme long-shot (from &quot;Valar Dohaeris&quot;) resembles the kind of fear-realizing and mad-scrambling often found in cartoons: Sam Tarly's service is twofold here: first, his general service as a man of the Night's Watch; second, his particular service as a member of a scouting party, which was to tend to and dispatch distress-ravens. That he failed to do so during his epic flight from the White Walker only indicates that he failed to meet the terms of his service, not that he escaped the responsibility of serving altogether. The episode's director, Daniel Minahan, could have foregrounded the humiliation written on Sam's face when his Lord Commander upbraids him by using a close-up, which would've captured every mortified muscle trying not to twitch with shame; instead, Minahan decided to shoot Sam in a medium close-up with his Lord Commander in an off-center two-shot that suggests both the bonds these two share and the precariousness of their situation: But it is not just these two, bound by service though they may be, who are in a tight spot. The reverse to the long shot—which is even more unbalanced than the one from which it reverses—heightens Sam's humiliation by including the presence of everyone he failed to serve: Point being, the opening sequence strongly suggests that service (and its terms) will be a thematic element of this episode in a way that death (in its finality) was not in &quot;Valar Morghulis.&quot; In truth, saying that...</span></a></div>
