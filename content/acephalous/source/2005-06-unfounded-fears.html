The traditional approach to history in an English course is typically uni-directional. For pedagogical reasons, English-types presume history an unchanging stable scrim onto which they project the complexities of a literary text: “Look, children, look! Labor trouble at the turn-of-the-century! What does Looking Backward say about it? How does Bellamy’s novel allegorize, reflect, register, represent, symbolize or otherwise transmogrify that dull dry history into a capital-A work of Art?&quot;* As Miriam points out, “it’s very easy to slip into the habit of presenting historical background stripped of its own disciplinary signposts--especially when we don’t actually know the debates surrounding our history of choice.” She further “suspect[s] that many of us--[herself] included--present the history as somehow denuded of disagreement, while emphasizing the complexity of the assigned literary works.” Her suspicion’s justified. When teaching a novel as influential as Looking Backward the problem becomes even thornier: to stick with the scrim-metaphor, now the complex literary work isn’t merely being projected on the scrim, it’s altering its molecular composition. The dim pinks become bright reds and the dark purples pale to lavender as the advent of an evangelical Christian socialism sweeps across the country. Should an English professor foreground the novel-as-impetus-for-cultural-change or the cultural-moment-ripe-for-an-impetuous-novel? (Yes, I desperately need to refresh my German. Or forget it entirely.) Short of resorting to a clumsy New Historicist leveling of all discourses, I’m curious as to how you, dear readers, confront (and confound) these dilemmas in the classroom or your own work. Or do you consider historical and formal questions utterly divorced and English professors only qualified to speak to the latter? *Could I come up with a clunkier and more unartistic novel to stand as my exemplar of an aesthetic interpretation of an historical moment?</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/storming_castle.html"><span><strong>Storming Castles in the Air, a Request in D-Minor</strong> [Cross-posted over yonder] [Edit: Superfluous Swaddling Removed] A broken Mr. Dorrit, recently of Marshalsea prison, moved over the French countryside. Ensconced in his “snug corner,” he fell to castle-building as he rode along. It was evident that he had a very large castle in hand. All day long he was running towers up, taking towers down, adding a wing here, putting on a battlement there, looking to the walls, strengthening the defences, giving ornamental touches to the interior, making in all respects a superb castle of it... On the heels of last week’s discussion on alternative histories, I’m inspired by China Mieville’s The Scar to ask a similar question about a similar speculative endeavour: building castles in the air. New Crobuzon’s one of the best realized castle-in-the-air I’ve ever encountered. Its effectiveness, I’d wager, stems from the manner in which it seems not to have been created but evolved. I once spent three months in Urbino and as soon as that city--with its unreal angles and centuries old inhumanly steep streets of inlaid brick ladders--seeps into your brain, the obsession with cities as agglutinate as German concept-nouns inevitably follows. So it has. (So much so I’m even fascinated by Jon Jerde’s excessively colorful simulations.) For the sake of clarity, I’ll call these “evolved cities,” as “representations of fictional cities earthed in a faux-historical developmental process such that it’s as compellingly complex and un-invented-seeming as Drieser’s Chicago or Chandler’s Los Angeles” sounds deeply stupid. So, yes, literary representations of similarly “evolved cities.” I’ve located a number myself, including Marco Polo’s in Calvino’s Invisible Cities--although I’m looking for fully realized cities, so Calvino can’t really count--William Gibson’s suburb-on-a-bridge in Virtual Light; Gormenghast Castle in Peake’s Titus Groans and Gormenghast; the Orange/Los Angeles/San Diego County mall-complex in Robinson’s The Gold Coast; etc. The unflattering way to phrase this request would be that I’m looking for works which’ll foster the felt-immersion of a fourteen-year-old’s first encounter with Tolkien or an undergraduate’s first flipping of Ulysses. So come on already! This is a p-a-r-t-y! Your quarter/semester/Monday’s done and what would you rather do than discuss your favorite fictional environs? Don’t tell me you’re all off watching The Scholar. A Highly Personal (and Possibly Inappropriate) P.S.: If anyone’s ever figured out all the film references on John Vanderslice’s Cellar Door and wouldn’t mind sharing them, I’d be forever in your debt. I’ve connected the obvious--&quot;Promising Actress” and Mulholland Drive and “When It Hits My Blood” and Requiem for a Dream--but outside of the obvious I’m as dense as ever.</span></a></div>
