In &quot;Walking Dead,&quot; why is there only one black male in the group at a time? There was the dad at the beginning, then he got left behind. There was a little overlap with TJ and Oscar, but as soon as another black guy shows up, Oscar gets it. Is this something that comes from the original comic, or a TV producer tic? Some sort of TV Trope Law of Conservation thing? </p></span>

The distinction of the series is that not only is there almost never more than one black male in the story at a time, but they have almost no lines. </p>

<p>My other question is why -- or how -- no one&#39;s hair grows on that show except Hershel&#39;s. It&#39;s been over a year in the narrative now, and the producers are making efforts to show that the walkers are decaying, but Hershel&#39;s the only guy whose beard has grown or has had any real hair growth. Are there barbers hiding out in the post-zombie-apocalypse woods of Georgia? For a show that puts so much effort into production value, it&#39;s weird.</p>

<p>See the image below for proof (click on the thumbnail for the full image); three seasons in, and Rick still has the same coma-scruff since the first episode. I grew more facial hair for Movember than he has in a year.</p>

<p>... that said, as someone who currently looks like an extra from <em>Game of Thrones</em>, I wholeheartedly agree that the neatly trimmed beards and hair a little off-putting, but I can stand that lack of realism given that I can&#39;t understand the show&#39;s zombie rules anymore. Zombie rules should be the first thing a zombie show establishes, unless of course the inability to learn the zombie rules is foregrounded, which in this case might only, barely, be the case. </p></span>

<p>The lack of foregrounded zombie rules is also there in the comic, and seems to be a hidden plot device to guarantee a prolonged series. After all, after the first 10 issues or so (and first five or so episodes), the zombies are almost secondary to this story.  </p></span>

Swords! Swords! in &quot;Baelor&quot;</strong> Earlier in the quarter, I introduced my students to the anything-that's-longer-than-it-is-wide mode of psychoanalytic criticism. Not very sophisticated, I know, but it helps explain the historical context of certain rhetorical tropes.* Given that this class is based on Game of Thrones, the discussion inevitably landed on the subject of swords as phallic symbols, and I noted that while there's nothing necessary or natural about that connection, it is one of long-standing and therefore might have influenced how George R.R. Martin employed them in his narrative. Which the students took to mean &quot;SWORDS EQUAL PENISES,&quot; a not altogether unfortunate development given how the Arya and Needle string undermines conventional gender assumptions. It did, however, make teaching the ninth episode, &quot;Baelor,&quot; a little difficult. The episode opens with Lord Commander Mormont gifting a sword, Longclaw, meant for his son, Jorah Mormont, to Jon Snow. Snow proceeds down the stairs and is immediately accosted by his Wall-fellows: Keeping in mind what my students think swords equal, consider the eyeline match in this shot. Not explicit enough? Fine: That man seems a little too excited to see Jon's sword. They all seem a little too excited to see Jon's sword. And Jon seems a little too happy at how excited they all are to see his sword. But he obliges: If you think I'm being juvenile and sword-blinkered, consider this scene in which a captured Jaime Lannister throws himself before the mercy of Lady Stark: Nothing emasculating about that. The same can't be said for this: Even skipping over the scene in which Daenerys demands that the previously de-sworded Jorah Mormount draw his sword for her, it's clear that this episode is very much about swords. Remember how it ends? I mean after Arya considers drawing the symbol of male empowerment she's appropriated for herself before realizing the inevitable futility of doing so: There you go. The point of all this is that anyone analyzing this episode needs to account for its economy of swords: they're distributed, re-distributed, lost, stolen, and finally wielded by a masked man at a sham of an execution. This execution, by the by, neatly parallels the scene in the first episode in a manner that highlights their differences: in both instances a man is being executed, only in &quot;Baelor&quot; the beheader has become the beheadee, the trial isn't just, and the Stark child witnessing it is commanded not to look. So, as I was saying, swords! Swords! Swords! Swords! *As an example of psychoanalytic criticism, I use an explication of The Castle circa 1950, in which the tall lanky K. and his short round assistants, Artur and Jeremias, are reduced to the walking-talking male genitalia Kafka clearly intended them to be.</span></a></div>
