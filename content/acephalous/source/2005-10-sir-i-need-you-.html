        <meta name="description" content="When I earned a summer dissertation fellowship last May, I felt as if a burden had been lifted. I would have the time to finish &quot;This Damnable London Chapter: Radical Frustration and the Dissertating Subject&quot; by the end of September and spend the Fall Quarter hard at work on evolutionary romance. I had reason for optimism: 36 pages of distilled prose from 129 pages of notes and an entire summer in which to refine it further. Only no refining happened. Instead I decided to dig deeper into the historical record in order to verify (according to what I now realize may have been an enthusiastically embraced but utterly unreal standard) the claims that I had made. First excised from the original 36 pages: an essential but highly selective account of Haeckel's influence on London. I hadn't read enough Haeckel—I hadn't even read all the Haeckel London presumably had—so the strength of those claims could be considered suspect. Note the infected language: &quot;enough,&quot; &quot;presumably,&quot; &quot;could be considered,&quot; &quot;suspect.&quot; So I read more Haeckel and more American reaction to Haeckel. I accumulated another 76 pages of notes. The tally? May 1, 2005: 36 pages polished, 129 pages of notes June 1, 2005: 32 pages polished, 205 pages of notes So I put aside the chapter for a week and focused on reading Theory's Empire and producing an account of the early years of Critical Inquiry. Exactly the healthy distraction I required to refocus on writing. Reading the rigorous but a- or anti-historicist accounts of literarture liberated me to chance tangents I wouldn't have in May. I expanded material I'd thought polished a month previous and finished June with 48 pages of polished prose and barely three more pages of notes. June 1, 2005: 32 pages polished, 205 pages of notes July 1, 2005: 48 pages polished, 208 pages of notes I put it down again and focused on reading for pleasure. Spent a day with China Mieville, another with John Clute; one week re-reading Octavia Butler and another the articles and books I'd be teaching in the Fall. I returned to my chapter refreshed but unprepared to encounter this steaming pile of unsubstantiated leaps of a logic unrecognizable to Man or Beast. (Not all Beast, mind you: a literate house-cat island-hopping shelves in a campus bookstore would recognize the &quot;interdisciplinary&quot; nature of my disaster.) I could hardly stomach my own complacency. I had though this deserving of reward? After seven solid hours of prodigious hyperventilation I managed to lift the pencil and make the first incision. Four days later, the patient was alive but paralyzed from the governing logic down. An intralineal drip nourished it, but as I looked at it in that bed I knew that unless it could someday manufacture evidence of its own, it wouldn't matter what I placed between its lines. I knew I could rebuild it. Better. Faster.

That said: the entry previous to this one should not have been published. I don't have the heart to delete it yet. It stewed (if intermittently) on the back-burner all day and I ought to at least let it have its moment on the table. It wants to be consumed. But like any good cook, I know better than to let the food I prepare adjudicate its quality. It is an unfit judge—kith if not kin, I venture, to the undergraduate essay which pleads for the superior mark its author almost desired enough to put forth what those in the rest of the world call &quot;effort&quot; in order to acquire it. So I put the previous post on the table with a disappointed scowl. I encourage you to place your adventurousness back in the pocket from whence it came and save it for something more exotic. I'll plate some Porteguese-Moroccan Fusion for you next week, I promise. Just please, let that poor post die its quiet death. (Were my delirium not itself delirious I would now segue into my now well-rehearsed schpiel about the importance of habitual writing. But as it is and I doubly so, I'll refrain.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/two_observation.html"><span><strong>Two Observations on Etiquette</strong> When people who are my Baby Sister (21 years old but still forever Baby) call to tell me that they're putting my beloved dog down tomorrow, they must include all relevent qualifiers, foremost among them &quot;may,&quot; &quot;if this medicine fails,&quot; &quot;to treat a common ailment,&quot; and &quot;is ninety-percent effective.&quot; Because Baby Sister, minus those qualifiers my mind tends morbid. If you're from Baton Rouge, reached here by Googling my name and spent over an hour and a half reading through everything I've written in the past seven months, comment on something or send me an email. You must be someone who knows me and wants to know what I've been up to .... which means you must be one of the four people who mattered in high school. We should catch up. Shoot the shit. I can tell you about my rise to these dazzling heights. You can tell me about the eleven kids you bore über-stud Lance Mayeux and we can have entertaining conversations about all the people you didn't sleep with while we were dating. We can discuss what it means to be passive-aggressive and how entertaining we find such cold cruel displays. Or maybe you're that unfortunate soul who thought people would respect him if he brought a briefcase to class. If you are, well then, we should catch up! You're the reason I only returned home a bloody pulp twice a week. I owe you recompense.</span></a></div>
