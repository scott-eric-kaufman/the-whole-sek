				<blockquote><p>A doctor in Maine writes: &quot;I read your book with profound
interest, not thinking of 'a nigger in the woodpile' until I came
to your drug list. But he looks like a good nigger, so here goes
my check for the first order. And if what you sell accords with
what you say other orders will follow.&quot; Another doctor writes: &quot;
I have used your tablets for two years and do not see how I
ever practiced without them,&quot; and incloses a $15 order. A great
many have written: &quot;I cannot practice without your drugs.&quot;
</p>

<p>Old men retired from practice, who had taken drugs for their infirmities
until drugging lost its effect, finding relief and a new
lease on life and health from the use of the congenials, have written
long letters that bring the tears to our eyes. One suffering
with spinal disease, caused by nerve tension, wrote that he must
die, but his work was not done. Bichromate of potash and veratrum relaxed the tension, and Epsom water application to the
spine every night neutralized the toxins that made the tension,
kept down every vestige of inflammation and gave ease and sleep
and cured the spinal trouble and set him on his feet again with
the power to finish his work. It was our tablets Nos. 3 and 5
which did the work.</p>
<p>The doctor said it was a good nigger in our woodpile. He is
right; there is no other nigger like ours. Our nigger tries to be
as white as he can, and if he was somewhere else you could not
tell that he is one. He is not obliged to hide in the woodpile,
like the niggers of the great manufacturing concerns, neither is he
afraid of the officers like the coons in the medical trust; he never
stole a chicken in his life and fears no one. It was necessary for
him to take charge of the woodpile, we have use for him there,
and what pleases us so much is that he feels his importance and
will not associate with other niggers or the &quot;common white
folks,&quot; but will run to meet a doctor any time and calls him &quot;
Boss.&quot;</p>

<center>[...]</center>
<p>If it were not for our little nigger, our
work must be left to the mercy of the character that has no
mercy. If we allow our calcium to be deprived of the sharp
alkaline sting on the tongue, and everything soluble to be leached
from our chalk, and to have our sudorifics and stimulants totally
destroyed by incorporated anodynes, then our work is a failure,
and we might have been the servant of theory as well as truth,
and the obligations we feel toward our brother man will never
be satisfied; he will reap no advantage for all the benefits conferred
upon us. &quot;Our work is not done.&quot;</p>
<p>But the little nigger laughs, and understands why he must
stick close to that woodpile; he knows who to call &quot;Boss,&quot; and
the Boss knows why he is there, and that it is not for the purpose
of hiding, the way the big niggers hide. In introducing our drug
list we wish to say that our &quot;special process&quot; consists in putting
together what we want in perfectly dry powders the same that
the doctor would prepare in chart, and in keeping these powders
dry all the time. So that when the tablet dissolves in the mouth
or stomach it will have the same effect as a chart or capsule, each
drug exerting its own peculiar effect, free from all previous
chemical change. No one can have a special process of greater
importance than this, and we challenge the scientific world and
the unscientific to show up by the side of it. </p></blockquote><p>

Normally I can make hash of racist-inflected lunacy, but I don't have a clue how the phrase functions in this book.</p>

It seems a rather strange bit of misdirection: &quot;You don&#39;t know or understand what&#39;s in our tablets, and you don&#39;t need to know. You might be concerned that what you don&#39;t know might hurt you, but this doctor took a look at our list of ingredients and found nothing alarming.  Further more, this thing you don&#39;t know about is a very good thing and hidden for very good reasons.  It is not hidden to deceive you, steal from you, or lie in wait to kill you, as if it were some nigger.  Nigger, nigger, nigger.&quot;  Or something like that.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-109647048-content"><p>Seems to be a case of yanking together two different metaphors, ie: &#39;nigger in the woodpile&#39; (something hidden and secret), and &#39;good nigger&#39; (one who lives to serve white guys, knows his place, etc etc). The argument, therefore (as jpool says): no need to be afraid of our secret magical ingredients, because they&#39;re only there to do good for you. To anyone with any kind of grasp of the English language, however, it&#39;s jarring because the two metaphors are fundamentally in conflict: the n in the woodpile is, by definition, a bad n (since he&#39;s either running away from or cuckolding the white man). Conclusion: the writer was not just a racist scumbag, he was also one of those halfwitted cranks who can string words together with good grammatical competence but who have no normal functioning logic. It&#39;s a combination that frequently confuses people who are not actually insane, so I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about not being able to understand him.</p></span>

The other 0.01 percent is when I read something like this in a 1980 Taxon article on &quot;Cladistics in Botany&quot;: One only has to attend a symposium on classification with cladists to discover that in any given case there is usually no consensus of opinion as to what chosen character is apomorphic and which is not; the reason why there is disagreement is that a certain number of works have a certain classification &quot;in their heads&quot; already and, perhaps subconsciously, anticipate the result of a cladistic procedure. Other biologists disagree because they have something else in mind. This brings me to another nigger in the wood pile: what is character? (emphasis mine) Not the technical answer the author wants, but my definition would include something about resisting the urge to refer to a critical lacuna as &quot;another nigger in the wood pile.&quot; It might even extend to thinking the phrase itself offensive on its face, such that it ought not be thought, much less submitted to peer review.</span></a></div>
