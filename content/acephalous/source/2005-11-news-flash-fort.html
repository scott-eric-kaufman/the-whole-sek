<p>
SF author Jack McDevitt told SCI FI Wire that his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0441013295"><em>Seeker</em></a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" />, contains numerous symbols, which he leaves for the readers to interpret. For example, <em>Seeker</em>'s protagonist, antiquarian Alex Benedict, discovers a cup from the long-lost ship <em>Seeker</em> and sets out to find the ship. The cup is a symbol, but McDevitt doesn't say of what.</p>

<p>&quot;Symbolic writing is necessary to make fiction work,&quot; he said in an
interview. &quot;The reason is that a novelist or short story writer is not
simply delivering a narrative, but (s)he is creating an experience for
the reader. When a character becomes jealous, the reader, ideally,
feels the emotion. That can't be accomplished simply by telling the
reader that Character A is jealous. And this is where the symbol comes
in.&quot;
</p>

<p>To illustrate his point, McDevitt referred to Charles Dickens' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0553212443"><em>A Christmas Carol</em></a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" />.
&quot;When the Spirit and Scrooge stand outside the Cratchits' house on
Christmas Eve, Scrooge asks whether [Tiny] Tim will live. Dickens could
have had the Spirit reply, 'No, it's not going to happen.' But that
doesn't carry sufficient impact. So he uses symbols to appeal to the
reader's senses: 'I see an empty chair, and a crutch by the fire.'&quot; <br />

Try the Holbonic blog post <a href="http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2004/07/crisis_on_the_i.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for instance, and skip down right to the end, to the paragraph headed &quot;Hey, I&#39;ve got a great idea! What if a god just sort of came of ... a machine?&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny, yes, but it makes you concerned for the genre.  Sure, not everthing written within the genre is at that level.  But that both the people publishing the article containing the proud explanation of a naive rediscovery and the vast majority of its readers didn&#39;t notice and laugh indicates that there is no critical or even economic pressure separating the good from the bad within the genre.</p></span>

I rarely read it and when I do I become frustrated by the ambiguity others rejoice. So it may sound strange when I say that the only book of poetry I find compelling is John Ashbery's The Wave. According to Robert Mazzocco, his ability to go on and on has always struck me as the signal characteristic of the work of John Ashbery. Many of Ashbery's poems are really improvisations on the theme of flux. That sounds terrible. And as I learned today as I skimmed his collected works, the experience of reading improvisations on the theme of flux is akin to the experience of grading undergraduate composition essays. You never can tell what they mean or why they're saying what they're saying but you get the distinct impression that they desperately desire you suss it out. Then I hit selections from The Waves again and I remembered why I bought the book in the first place: it feels like Kafka to me. Another way to say that is I spent the summer after I graduated reading nothing but Kafka. In The Waves, Ashbery taps the same vein of alienation. For example, here's Kafka's parable &quot;An Imperial Message&quot;: The Emperor—so they say—has sent a message, directly from his death bed, to you alone, his pathetic subject, a tiny shadow which has taken refuge at the furthest distance from the imperial sun. He ordered the herald to kneel down beside his bed and whispered the message in his ear. He thought it was so important that he had the herald speak it back to him. He confirmed the accuracy of verbal message by nodding his head. And in front of the entire crowd of those witnessing his death—all the obstructing walls have been broken down, and all the great ones of his empire are standing in a circle on the broad and high soaring flights of stairs—in front of all of them he dispatched his herald. The messenger started off at once, a powerful, tireless man. Sticking one arm out and then another, he makes his way through the crowd. If he runs into resistence, he points to his breast where there is a sign of the sun. So he moves forwards easily, unlike anyone else. But the crowd is so huge; its dwelling places are infinite. If there were an open field, how he would fly along, and soon you would hear the marvellous pounding of his fist on your door. But instead of that, how futile are all his efforts. He is still forcing his way through the private rooms of the innermost palace. Never will he win his way through. And if he did manage that, nothing would have been achieved. He would have to fight his way down the steps, and, if he managed to do that, nothing would have been achieved. He would have to stride through the courtyards, and after the courtyards through the second...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/the_final_word_.html"><span><strong>The Final Word on Faith; or, The Place of Metal Plates in Religious Thought</strong> Anyone who knows me knows my opinion of religion runs in stride with that of Bill , er, William James . I admire the will to believe in the face of all logical obstacles to faith. But as someone once sort of said: &quot;Some faiths' fathers are bigger than other faiths' fathers.&quot; Close enough for government work. I understand the lure of tradition, the comfort of struggle, the intuition of order and all the many reasons faith survives in a world without reason. (I could discuss in great and grave detail the respect I have for the denizens of The Weblog via a discussion of God as omnipresent syncategorem to their otherwise secular propositions. Another night.) That said, to respond to unreasonable reality by spending $226 million etching science fiction novels from the fifties on stainless steel plates, wrapping those plates in Kevlar and burying them in bunkers smacks of untenable thought. Especially when those bunkers bear the symbol of The Church of Spiritual Technology. Unhinged from tradition, faith becomes a unsound enterprise productive of nothing other than unstable minds. While I cannot identify the precise moment when faith slips from struggle to suspect irrationality, I can say in no uncertain terms that once you consider etching Battlefield Earth on stainless steel plates to better bury them deep beneath the Nevada desert a fine idea, you've crossed the line.</span></a></div>
