			<blockquote><p>I have been scientifically studying the traits and dispositions of the &quot;lower animals&quot; (so-called) and contrasting them with the traits and dispositions of man.&nbsp; I find the result profoundly humiliating to me.&nbsp; For it obliges me to renounce my allegiance to the Darwinian theory of the Ascent of Man from the Lower Animals; since it now seems plain to me that that theory ought to be vacated in favor of a new and truer one, this new and truer one to be named the <em>De</em>scent of Man from the Higher Animals.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Some of my experiments were quite curious.&nbsp; In the course of my reading I had come across a case where, many years ago, some hunters on our Great Plains organized a buffalo hunt for the entertainment of an English earl—that, an to provide some fresh meat for his larder. They had charming sport.&nbsp; They killed seventy-two of those great animals; and ate part of one of them and left the seventy-one to rot.&nbsp; In order to determine the difference between an anaconda and an earl—if any—I caused seven young calves to be turned into the anaconda's cage [of the London Zoological Garden].&nbsp; The grateful reptile immediately crushed one of them and swallowed it, then lay back satisfied.&nbsp; It showed no further interest in the calves, and no disposition to harm them.&nbsp; I tried this experiment with other anacondas; always with the same result.&nbsp; The fact stood proven that the difference between an earl and an anaconda is, that the earl is cruel and the anaconda isn't; and that the earl wantonly destroys what he has no use for, but the anaconda doesn't.&nbsp; This seemed to suggest that the earl was descended from the anaconda, and had lost a good deal in the transition.</p>

<p>I was aware that many men who have accumulated more millions of money than they can ever use, have shown a rabid hunger for more, and have not scrupled to cheat the ignorant and the helpless out of their poor savings in order to partially appease that appetite.&nbsp; I furnished a hundred different kinds of wild and tame animals the opportunity to accumulate vast stores of food, but none of them would do it.&nbsp; The squirrels and bees and certain birds made accumulations, but stopped when they had gathered a winter's supply, and could not be persuaded to add to it either honestly or by chicane.&nbsp; In order to bolster up a tottering reputation the ant pretended to store up supplies, but I was not deceived.&nbsp; I know the ant.&nbsp; These experiments convinced me that there is a difference between man and the Higher Animals: he is avaricious and miserly, they are not.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Among my experiments was this.&nbsp; In an hour I taught a cat and a dog to be friends.&nbsp; I put them in a cage.&nbsp; In another hour I taught them to be friends with a rabbit.&nbsp; In the course of two days I was able to add a fox, a goose, a squirrel and some doves.&nbsp; Finally a monkey.&nbsp; They lived together in peace; even affectionately.</p>

<p>Next, in another cage I confined an Irish Catholic from Tipperary, and as soon as he seemed tame I added a Scotch Presbyterian from Aberdeen.&nbsp; Next a Turk from Constantinople; a Greek Christian from Crete; an Armenian; a Methodist from the wilds of Arkansaw; a Buddhist from Chrina; a Brahmin from Benares.&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, a Salvation Army Colonel from Wapping.&nbsp; Then I stayed away two whole days.&nbsp; When I came back to note results, the cage of Higher Animals was all right, but in the other there was but a chaos of gory odds and ends of turbans and fezzes and plaids and bones and flesh—not a specimen left alive.&nbsp; These Reasoning Animals had disagreed on a theological detail and carried the matter to a Higher Court.</p></blockquote>

Hello. Who am I? I am always Antonin Artaud. As I write this you will imagine my present body BURSTING INTO SHARDS, then remade under the heinous auspices of my new body and you will never forget me. I am on my space in a means DISSECTED by my space or on it. But it could just as well not be me not be linked to me but to them. Alongside their appetite for living is the enthroned appetite for food to transform into shit which they fear they will lose. I will not lose your shit. But there is a thing which is a something the only one thing which is a something which I feel because it wants TO GET OUT. It is your shit and I will not lose it. I will empower it with magnets and hold it down by sordid influence and by SITTING. Others &quot;sustain emphatically that [I] the discursive tropes of metaphor and metonymy in [my] praxis of CINEMATIC NARRATION in order to attain a poetic deferment of meaning.&quot; Others are wrong. Their shit will be lost. Nouveau message. What is a DEPOSIT I am asked. Hello I love your HONDA they declare. I should buy PHENTERMINE and PLAY DATING and my mind will be a VOID. BUT SHRUG. ANT FARM. BUT SHRUG ANT FARM.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/google-requests.html"><span><strong>Google Requests, I Deliver, Part I: &quot;Comic Book Rape; or, What Would You Like Me to Title It?&quot;</strong> (Being the first in a series of reposts being reposted solely because Googlers likes them. After &quot;My Morning,&quot; this is the second most popular post on Acephalous. Because Googlers want nothing more than to see some &quot;comic book rape,&quot; &quot;rogue rape,&quot; and, most distressingly, &quot;comic rape.&quot; Because when you get right down to it, is anything inherently funnier than rape?) This post isn't a direct response to &quot;Comic Book Guys Are Stupid,&quot; but it is a response of some kind. Let me walk you through this one: The year is 1988. I'm a recent transplant to Louisiana and am thus a tad on the introverted side. I spend endless hours reading comic books. I may have liked some girls at this point, but I see no evidence of it in my fourth grade yearbook. (My fifth grade yearbook is an entirely different, hearts-encircling-pictures story.) Point being, I distinctly remember not thinking about nor even knowing what rape was. But I mow my lawn every day—my father having decided to instill the value of hard work by allowing me to earn $4 whenever I want by re-re-re-mowing what my work ethic transformed into a mangy lawn—and so have plenty of money to blow on X-books. So I'm spending my afternoons blissfully unaware of anything which doesn't involve the X-Men or X-Factor or The New Mutants or, if I was desperate enough, Alpha Flight. One late October afternoon I'm holding in my hands X-Men #236. On the cover Wolverine and Rogue are hung by their on a scaffold, flanked on both sides by grinning fools in military garb. (This picture disturbs me more now than it did then.) What happened? The X-Men sacrificed themselves to save the world, only in the end they were granted a reprieve: they would be dead to the world but would live undetected and undetectable in the Australian outback. They were invisible to all forms of electronic recording devices. They were able to move throughout the world invisible to all by the naked eye. (You want to privilege presence? I'll privilege you some presence.) Then a fascist state called &quot;Genosha&quot; clashes with the X-Men. Shit hits fans. Wolverine and Rogue are captured. For those unfamiliar with the comics or the films, Rogue has the power to absorb the memories and/or mutant powers of whomever she touches. So naturally, she doesn't touch anyone for fear of knocking them unconscious and draining them of their &quot;life energy.&quot; (Stop sniggering. I was in fourth grade.) Her entire life Rogue has wanted nothing more than to touch someone without hurting them. To be loved. But she's come to accept the fact that this will never happen. This self-sacrifice moves the fourth-grade mind. I sympathized with her despite having no clue as to what she sacrificed or why. I only know that it pained her and, being the good sympathetic identifier, felt her pain by proxy. So without really knowing why I want Rogue to able to touch people. After she's captured...</span></a></div>
