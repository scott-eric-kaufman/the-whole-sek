The rule of thumb is that we verb when an alternative is not available, so we can &quot;jail&quot; people but not &quot;prison&quot; them (because &quot;imprison&quot; already exists). But &quot;befriend&quot; seems strangely inappropriate when applied to Facebook, which is why the preferred usage is &quot;friend.&quot; Perhaps it&#39;s a recognition that Facebook friends are not really friends. Or if they are friends, the quality of friendship differs enough from that of non-Facebook (or 3D) friends that to use the same word would imply too much?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a64ba57d970b-content"><p>First, I didn&#39;t mean to be cryptic as to who it is I resembled.  I figured most of my readers would be familiar not only with DFW, but with that particular, you could say &quot;iconic,&quot; book jacket photo ... and that&#39;s an odd assumption to make, given that 1) not everyone reads DFW and 2) his other iconic photo, with the bandana, is more iconic than that one.  </p>

<p>That said, it&#39;s nice to see someone I actually went to high school, James, indicate that I looked like I (and a host of others) did in high school in that photo.  The clothes were authentic, as was the beard, although I think it actually may&#39;ve been thicker in high school.</p>

<blockquote>But &quot;befriend&quot; seems strangely inappropriate when applied to Facebook, which is why the preferred usage is &quot;friend.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>I absolutely think that I could&#39;ve use the verbed &quot;friend&quot; up there, as there&#39;s absolutely something different between meat-space and online-only friendships.  I mean, I&#39;ve only met five of the people in this thread in meat-space, and I consider them friends, but I felt differently about the status of that friendship after having met them in person.  </p>

<p>P.S. That&#39;s a wig, Mom.  </p></span>

<p>Modesto, in the vast majority of times I&#39;ve encountered the usage, it&#39;s been &quot;friend&quot; as a verb. &quot;Do you friend students?&quot; &quot;I totally friended him!&quot; etc. SEK&#39;s is the first time I&#39;ve seen &quot;befriend&quot; used in this way.

I wonder what non-tendentious conclusions he'll draw this time? Ayers and Obama both describe the crisis in the Chicago school system as &quot;perpetual.&quot; Ayers and Obama both complain about increasingly larger educational bureaucracies. Ayers and Obama both criticize the &quot;status quo.&quot; In short, the liberal politician and the liberal academics both air liberal grievances. For some reason, Cashill finds this compelling. The reason, of course, is that Cashill's not that bright. Need more proof? Ayers and a '60s radical in Obama's book both bitch about the Man. Ayers and a '60s radical in Obama's book both think education is a tool belonging to the Man. Cashill is actually shocked by the fact that Bill Ayers, a '60s radical, makes statements similar to those made by '60s radicals. He believes the fact that Bill Ayers, a '60s radical, and other '60s radical use the same language to be incriminating. He must be the only person to watch a Cheech and Chong movie sober and wonder, on account of them talking so similarly, whether they weren't actually the same person.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/11/not-surprisingly-what-i-saw-in-my-flashforward-wasnt-me-watching-flashforward.html"><span><strong>Not surprisingly, what I saw in my flashforward wasn't me watching Flashforward.</strong> If I were to tell you that a television series in which John Cho (a.k.a. the Harold who went to White Castle) consistently steals scenes from Joseph Fiennes (of the Acting Fienneses) exists, you'd likely laugh at me. But it does. Every Thursday night brings us another bizarrely-paced episode of Flashforward. Loosely based on the Robert J. Sawyer novel (which I haven't read) of the same name, the show follows a team of FBI agents investigating the origin of a worldwide loss of consciousness. For two minutes and thirteen seconds, everyone on the planet lost consciousness and (as per the title) caught an exclusive showing of their lives six months in the future (29 April 2010).* The premise is interesting enough, and when the narrative focuses on the secular equivalent of arguments about predestination, the show works. For example, because so many people seemed to have obscenely meaningful flashforwards, even those people who saw themselves walking into an unfamiliar parking garage imbue theirs with meaning. The parking lot, after all, may only be unfamiliar now because a character hasn't been fired from one firm and hired by another. The characters mostly know this, but watching them struggle against the inevitability of the mundane makes for compelling television; however, the motor of the show is the drunken memory of Fiennes's Agent Mark Benford, who saw himself in his office 1) struggling to make sense of the whiteboard on which he and his team are collating the evidence of what caused the blackout and 2) being hunted by a team of assassins. The first element of his flashforward presents clues worthy of a Robbe-Grillet novel, in that Agent Benford is a recovering alcoholic trying to make sense of a half-seen evidence board while being pounded by the guilt of drinking after seven years of sobriety. He knows himself to be an unreliable narrator—is burdened by the fact of it—and yet he struggles to recreate the whiteboard as he remembers it from his flashforward. It's the second element of the flashforward that troubles me, not because I have qualms about David S. Goyer works featuring assassins (perish the thought), but because such action threatens to overwhelm the legitimately compelling high-conceptual quality of the show. This is not to say the two can't be combined: in one episode, for example, none of the FBI agents involved in a shootout bother to take cover because they know they're going to be alive six months later. But unless the writers veer into Longshot territory and have characters jump off buildings for the thrill of learning the strained chain of happenstance to which the universe must resort to keep them alive another six months, they run the risk of turning half of each episode into a tensionless exercise in faked foolhardiness. (The law of diminishing returns actually kicked in before that first action sequence ended.) You might object that viewers have been so thoroughly conditioned by a lifetime of televisual convention that they'll find such scenes compelling...</span></a></div>
