Then I started writing this post, which is, as per the title, about James Hudnall’s remarkably unselfconscious rant about Wonder Woman. Hudnall’s not interested in her costume change, which was apparently a topic of no small interest while I had my head in the sand, and about which all I have to say is this: if you attended a meeting and were the only one there wearing a swimsuit, would you feel uncomfortable? Enough said. For Hudnall, though, the debate about her costume merely provides him an excuse to attack her character. Like many a spurned misogynist, he does so by accusing her, and by proxy all feminists, of misandry. He begins: The problem with Wonder Woman isn’t her look. It’s her personality. She has never been a warm, appealing character. She comes from an island populated only by immortal Amazons who hate men. And men aren’t allowed to set foot on the island. This island of super-women send her to “the man’s world” where she brings the baggage of this sexist worldview. You want to talk about baggage? Consider what Hudnall brings to the table: women who are not “warm” are also not “appealing.” The first question, obviously, is what does he mean by “warm”? The second, of course, is “appealing” to whom? That he failed to notice that his definition of “warmth” entails that she must be “appealing” to men like him is a remarkable, albeit typical among his lot, feat of argumentative blindness: women who possess characteristics that he finds unattractive hate all men because they fail to cater or conform to Hudnall’s needs. In addition to his inability to distinguish the universal from the particular, he simply misunderstands the character. Wonder Woman does enjoy giving those who underestimate her because she’s a woman, be they thugs or comic villains, their comeuppance—a category that by extension includes readers like Hudnall, but more on that in a bit. But notice what Hudnall fails to: the comic universe is predicated on the logic of a vicarious enjoyment of comeuppance. Consider this scene in The Dark Knight. The nifty camerawork helps ratchet up the tension on a formal level, but on a narrative one, the tension comes from the viewer knowing what the Joker doesn’t: the implications of having crashed Bruce Wayne’s fundraiser. The viewer anticipates the comeuppance, because the Joker underestimated Wayne on account of his being a wealthy playboy. Same thing works in any situation in which Clark Kent is threatened. It even girds works that demonstrate the limitations of the genre, as that last panel neatly illustrates. In other words, despite being the motivating force behind the genre, the logic comeuppance only bothers Hudnall when men who underestimate women receive theirs. I wonder why that is?

			<p>I get mail:</p>
<blockquote><p>If <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jhudnall/2010/07/02/wonder-woman-reboot-strident-feminism-is-the-problem-not-the-costume/">this
 combination</a> of two of your favorite topics doesn’t rouse you from 
your blogging doldrums, nothing will.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>To which I replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>My my.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Then I started writing this post, which is, as per the title, about 
James Hudnall’s remarkably unselfconscious rant about Wonder Woman. 
Hudnall’s not interested in her costume change, which was apparently a 
topic of no small interest while I had my head in the sand, and about 
which all I have to say is this: if <em>you</em> attended a meeting and 
were the only one there wearing a swimsuit, would you feel 
uncomfortable? Enough said. For Hudnall, though, the debate about her 
costume merely provides him an excuse to attack her character. Like 
many a spurned misogynist, he does so by accusing her, and by proxy all 
feminists, of misandry. He begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem with Wonder Woman isn’t her look. It’s her 
personality. She has never been a warm, appealing character. She comes 
from an island populated only by immortal Amazons who hate men. And men 
aren’t allowed to set foot on the island. This island of super-women 
send her to “the man’s world” where she brings the baggage of this 
sexist worldview.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You want to talk about baggage? Consider what Hudnall brings to the 
table: women who are not “warm” are also not “appealing.” The first 
question, obviously, is what does he mean by “warm”? The second, of 
course, is “appealing” to whom? That he failed to notice that his 
definition of “warmth” entails that she must be “appealing” to <em>men 
like him</em> is a remarkable, albeit typical among his lot, feat of 
argumentative blindness: women who possess characteristics that he finds
 unattractive hate <em>all</em> men because they fail to cater or 
conform to <em>Hudnall’s</em> needs.</p>
<p>In addition to his inability to distinguish the universal from the 
particular, he simply misunderstands the character. Wonder Woman does 
enjoy giving those who underestimate her <em>because she’s a woman</em>,
 be they thugs or comic villains, their comeuppance—a category that by 
extension includes readers like Hudnall, but more on that in a bit. But
 notice what Hudnall fails to: the comic universe is predicated on the 
logic of a vicarious enjoyment of comeuppance.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/little-bit-more-on-teaching-the-dark-knight.html">this
 scene</a> in <em>The Dark Knight</em>. The nifty camerawork helps 
ratchet up the tension on a formal level, but on a <em>narrative</em> 
one, the tension comes from the viewer knowing what the Joker doesn’t: 
the implications of having crashed Bruce Wayne’s fundraiser. The viewer
 anticipates the comeuppance, because the Joker underestimated Wayne on 
account of his being a wealthy playboy. Same thing works in any 
situation in which Clark Kent is threatened. It even girds works that 
demonstrate <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/05/wonder-woman-watchmen-comparison.html">the
 limitations of the genre</a>, as that last panel neatly illustrates.</p>
<p>In other words, <em>despite being the motivating force behind the 
genre, the logic comeuppance only bothers Hudnall when men who 
underestimate women receive theirs</em>. </p>

<p> I wonder why that is?</p>
<p><span id="more-13792"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s deal with some reality for a second. I know the PC 
crowd and leftists in general love the concept of “protected classes” 
and the idea that, say, women could do things better than men if they 
had the chance.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Because he’s boxing the shadows of the reactionary first wave of 
feminism? Perhaps.</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]hile Diana Prince (Wonder Woman’s real name) does 
change her attitude somewhat when she comes ashore, the “whole men are 
evil” mentality continues. It’s misandry, plain and simple and that’s 
unappealing. She does undergo some growth as a character from her early 
days, but writers continue to revert to this lame argument, which is 
going to limit your audience to the self-loathing types.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Because his fundamental misunderstanding of the character extends 
into outright ignorance? Wonder Woman, after all, frequently <em>opposes</em>
 the Amazonian misandry by speaking <em>in defense</em> of the world of 
men when her sisters criticize it. Which is frequently. If anything, 
her opposition to that misandry is based on her belief in equality, 
inasmuch as the word can be applied to her and, say, Superman. Hudnall 
glosses over this with the “some” before “growth of character,” because 
he wants to ignore what is a defining quality of her character as 
currently conceived. His resistance to the manner of comeuppance she 
provides blinds him to the vicarious enjoyment others may take from it. 
 Don’t believe me?</p>
<blockquote><p>[S]he lacks personality. Any protagonist needs to be 
appealing in some way for the reader to identify with them or care about
 them.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>He can’t even <em>imagine</em> a reader who might care about or 
identify with a strong female character who enjoys giving men who 
underestimate her the comeuppance they deserve. No more need be said.</p>

<p>No real point in arguing with Hudnall: the guy has Byrne levels of ego and a chip on his shoulder the size of Wales[1], though it must feel good to let off some steam at such a dense target.</p>

<p>That said, where does he gets his impression of Wonder Woman from? It&#39;s so off it&#39;s embarassing. Both classically and post-Perez WW and the Amazons are supposed to be examplars of womanhood, to use an oldfashioned term, showing the male gender how superior a world run by women would be. That&#39;s somewhat different from hating all men...<br />

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f23b0f98970b-content"><p>It&#39;s reminiscent of my personal favorite unintentionally revealing line ever, from a critique of <i>The Vagina Monologues</i> published in UC Irvine&#39;s conservative newspaper.  It went something like: &quot;Think of the girls you know who swear like one of the guys.  You&#39;re most likely not as attracted to them.&quot;  From which we learn that: 1) Females are &quot;girls,&quot; 2) The intended audience (&quot;you&quot;) is male, not female; 3) The most important thing for &quot;girls&quot; is to be attractive to &quot;guys.&quot;</p>

<p>And the best part is, I was teaching <i>TVM</i> that quarter.  It was like receiving a perfect gift from your most hated enemy.</p></span>

Hayao Miyazaki directed both Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and Princess Mononoke, so I thought it might simply be a personal tic—epic nonsensical disaster followed by a natural renewal—but it even extends to works merely influenced by anime and manga. For example, I just finished watching the series Avatar: The Last Airbender (because Scott McCloud told me to) and there it is again: an epic nonsensical climax followed by a grossly sentimental denouement—this time the resolution of the love stories and a natural renewal—which leads me to believe that what I took to be tics are actually a rhetorically relevant structural element of these works. My working thesis is that it has something to do with the scouring of Hiroshima and Nagasaki—which were epic and nonsensical events followed by personal, natural and societal renewals—but before I head down the rabbit hole of secondary literature, it would be keen to know whether there isn't some more straightforward cultural or historical explanation.</span></a></div>
