			<p>Sarah Palin&#39;s latest <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,582924,00.html">pronouncement</a>:</p><blockquote>And
that double standard is—and that hypocrisy is another reason why so
many Americans are quite disgusted with the political games that are
played, not only on both sides of the aisle, but in this case, on the
left wing, what they are playing with this game of racism and kind of
letting Harry Reid&#39;s comments slide, but having crucified Trent Lott
for essentially along the same lines[.]</blockquote><p>Harry Reid stated a
political reality that only shocked people who are paid to feign shock:
that Americans find black people with lighter skin tones who sound
white are more likely to be elected than, say, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0_VBVXuyCM#t=2m14s">Frank Pembleton</a>, possibly the greatest character in the history of television. It&#39;s a <span style="font-style: italic;">sad</span>
truth that having dark skin and sounding different from white people
impacts a candidate&#39;s electability, but it&#39;s a truth nonetheless. What
Trent Lott said—what Palin believes to be &quot;essentially along the same
lines&quot; of Reid&#39;s lamentable political truth—was that he was proud that
Mississippi supported a segregationist candidate, and that the if the
rest of the country had &quot;followed our lead, we wouldn&#39;t have had all
these problems over all these years, either.&quot; Moreover, <em>to this day</em>
Lott hasn&#39;t explained what exactly &quot;all these problems&quot; that would&#39;ve
been avoided had blacks been kept in their place actually are.</p><p>So,
for Palin, acknowledging a sad political reality is the equivalent of
wishing that the Civil Rights Movement had never happened because, for
Palin, <em>racism is a game</em>. Not only is it a game, she
unwittingly confesses that she and her fellow Republicans are currently
very much playing it by themselves, and are annoyed that the Democrats
refuse to play along by &quot;kind of letting Harry Reid&#39;s comments slide.&quot;
She wants to play Race because <em>just this once</em>, she believes
her team can win. Is it any wonder the large majority of non-white
Americans find her and her party reprehensible?</p>

They form social circles and erect strict hierarchies, but the desire to live in a pack is either openly denigrated (witness every teen film), contextualized into a culturally acceptable substitute (witness every team film), or mocked as pure atavism (witness Buffy). But as Cesar Millan never tires of telling us, dogs are pack animals by instinct and acculturation: they are born into a litter and socialized into a pack. That being the case, their relationship to merely social animals (like humans) is necessarily vexed because the typical human family lacks the structure and numbers of a pack. The position of &quot;pack leader&quot; in a household featuring one or two dogs and a number of humans must (according to Millan) be created artificially. Whether this canine psychology is accurate or not is beside the point: its history is firmly embedded in the naturalist narratives and their various scions (literary and visual) that Millan unwittingly draws from. All of which only prefaces my actual argument here: Christopher Nolan thought the character of the Joker in The Dark Knight spoke to 1) the uneasiness of the human-canine détente and 2) the assumed applicability of canine cultural formations to human social hierarchies. Trying to process this, I run into the problem of excessive familiarity with both the film and the near-infinite iterations of man-animal sociobiological binaries such that I cannot, pace Beckett, find a form to accommodate the mess. Here's what I have so far: The Dark Knight opens with images that indicate membership in either a pack or a family. Each of the bank robbers in the opening sequence wears a mask bearing a grotesque version of one of the seven dwarfs (as indicated in what I believe is an officially sanctioned script): That would be the Joker carrying his Bozo mask ... and Bozo is not one of the seven dwarfs. The other criminals are all given names of canonical dwarfs (Dopey, Sleepy, Grumpy, etc.), but the Joker is a clown outsider who might (but given his subsequent actions, clearly does not) fit in. The Joker belongs to the correct clan (clowns), but the wrong family (seven dwarfs). Only &quot;family&quot; may be precisely the wrong term: I'm not sure (and research refuses to relinquish) whether the seven dwarfs were kin or clan. Their analogues' willingness to slaughter each other at the Joker's behest would seem to indicate that their bonds were of the &quot;You like crime? I like crime too!&quot; variety, but given the tired convention that &quot;the loyalty of a crew is inversely proportional to the size of the score,&quot; I have reservations. Either way, the film opens with an image of organized disloyalty by a coordinated group that ideally works in unison (i.e. a pack). This would be a dysfunctional pack. Nolan then introduces us to a functional one: This is the human-canine (or pack-to-pack-leader) relation we have come to expect: that Chechen criminal may be sadistic psychopath, but he's also a beloved pack...</span></a></div>

SEK: Welcome, folks, to my first (and most certainly last) interview with former Vice Presidential-candidate, Sarah Palin. Before we start, Sarah, I want to read what I wrote last night in my journal—I'm only kidding. That wouldn't be professional. How about we start with an easy one? I know how much you love circles, Sarah, so how about you talk in one for me? PALIN: The political system is what creates this disenchantment with the people looking at the political system. SEK: You are a marvel. Now, say something that reveals yourself to be even dumber than your haters think you are about, say, the results of the last election. PALIN: That is not a representative form of government that our country was founded upon. SEK: It certainly isn't. I mean, it can't be. Governments are only representative when they represent the perspective of— PALIN: Common sense conservatives. SEK: With— PALIN: Common sense conservative values. That's why you see pressure from the tea party movement, from others, wanting to—wanting those common sense conservative values back in. SEK: Such as? PALIN: Common sense solutions that sometimes we're made to feel stupid because we believe in these common sense solutions. SEK: Exactly. Do you think things will change? PALIN: I think things are going to change, too. And if you look back in history, you see that it is about—every 200 years, something drastically changes in a society, in a culture, in a governmental system. We're due for that change—just on a historical perspective, it shows us that yes, something is coming. SEK: You really believe that? PALIN: I do believe it, because again, we can't be so stupid as to see these common sense solutions. SEK: Speaking of the future, is it here today? PALIN: Already the change is creating this unrecognizable system that we're a part of. SEK: In the past, could the French see into the future, and if so, how would they feel about the French today? PALIN: Even the French recognized, too, the potential in this free country. And the French gifted the Statue of Liberty to us, in partnership, this international symbol of liberty and freedom—the French hoping that we wouldn't lose that and we won't evolve into something more along their lines. SEK: Precisely. One last thing: can you prove that the copy-editors at Fox are out to get you? PALIN: Well, let me tell you one thing in that vain. SEK: Thank you, Governor Palin, it's been a pleasure. PALIN: And the people are going to decide and I think he is going go and it is time. SEK: Thank you, Governor, the interview's over. You— PALIN: My favorite. That would be great. SEK: Your favorite? Favorite what? Seriously, Madame Governor, you— PALIN: Gems. Gems representing the natural resources in our nation. SEK: Gems? PALIN: Yes. I thought, oh, no, he's going to do a gotcha and that's why I google—I had Track google real...</span></a></div>
