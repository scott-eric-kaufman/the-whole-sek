<p>As her name suggests, The Little Womedievalist lives in the sparsely
populated academic “ghetto” known as “medieval studies.” (A wonderful
place to visit, but I didn’t want to live there.) Thing is, when
medievalists tip-toe into the 15<sup>th</sup> Century, they’re often
paralyzed by the unfamiliar literary landscape.&nbsp; “Whither my rigid
poetic forms?&nbsp; And feudalism!&nbsp; What have you people done with
feudalism?” Medievalists are confused, nay, <em>mortified</em> by the shiny baubles and the steam which periodically issues from them.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
So sometimes they need us soon-to-be-unemployed/forever-unemployable
modern-types after all, like when they want to write a syllabus on “The
Poetry of Crisis.” Below the fold you’ll find The Little
Womedievalist’s skeletal syllibi.&nbsp; Lots of war, lots of plague.&nbsp; The
word “pandemic” appears no less than <em>seventeen</em> times.

		<span id="comment-18914787-content"><p>What a wonderful idea for a course! I *wouldn&#39;t* have gone and criticized anything here, but since you ASKED, here are some suggestions, mostly on the Renaissance end.</p>

<p>&quot;Late Massacre in Piedmont&quot; - gah. Not a great sonnet. I&#39;d recommend either of Milton&#39;s two sonnets on Cromwell instead (and if you wanted to work in &quot;When I Consider&quot; or &quot;Methought I Saw&quot; under the personal crisis category, so much the better. (Just trying to make my boy Johnny M. look good, here.)</p>

<p>For Donne, I&#39;d probably do a couple of the Hymns or other devotional verse rather than/in addition to the Holy Sonnets: &quot;Hymn to God My God in My Sickness&quot; and &quot;Hymn to Christ at the Author&#39;s Last Going into Germany,&quot; esp.</p>

<p>And how about Lovelace, &quot;To Lucasta, Going to the Wars&quot;?</p>

<p>And for &quot;formal crises,&quot; Herbert&#39;s &quot;Jordan (1)&quot; or &quot;Jordan (2)&quot; are both good.</p>

<p>On a non-Early Modern note: what about Auden? His &quot;September 1, 1939&quot; got emailed around a lot in the wake of 9/11, although obviously it&#39;s about a quite different war, and &quot;Stop All the Clocks&quot; would also be good for the section on mortality.</p>

<p>Lowell also seems like he should be in here. &quot;For the Union Dead,&quot; perhaps?</p>

<p>And in addition to Sassoon, you might consider Rupert Brooke. His poems haven&#39;t aged well (and were probably always overrated), but they might be useful for just that reason--as a response to war that doesn&#39;t seem as useful or authentic to us any more.</p>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s enough from ME. Good luck--and I&#39;d love to see the final syllabus, whenever it might be complete.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-18916087-content"><p>For modern disaster, Carolyn Forche has a sexy anthology called something like &quot;Against Forgetting&quot; that pretty much covers everything bad the 20th c had to offer. Her own stuff on El Salvador in _The Country Between Us_ is very important too (although I grow exhausted trying to imagine teaching the nuances of mid-70s El Salvador to post-9/11 college students).</p>

<p>For Irish potato famine, Chris Morash has a good anthology, as well as an earlier book on styles of poetic commemoration of the famine that would be a great cheat-sheet to teaching some of the stuff. Eavan Boland has some stuff on the long view of Ireland&#39;s tragic side in _The Lost Land_. </p>

<p>For Depression-era disasters that led to labor movements, Muriel Rukeyser&#39;s &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; is pretty much indispensable.</p></span>

<p>Second, what about:<br />
 - Wulfstan&#39;s &quot;Sermo Lupi&quot; for the war/rebellion/unrest section<br />
 - Steinbeck&#39;s <i>Grapes of Wrath</i> (I know, obvious and high school-y, but can you do the Great Depression/Dust Bowl without it?)</p>

<p>Third...I work on 15th century texts and I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m a medievalist.  Then again, I was sure until today.  Maybe I don&#39;t live in the ghetto after all!  Woo-hoo! :)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-19066837-content"><p>Get ready for the obvious, because a few famous poems came to mind that would be wonderfully suited.</p>

<p>First of all, Langston Hughes&#39; &quot;Harlem,&quot; for social and political crises. (&quot;What happens to a dream deferred? [...] <i>Does it explode?</i>)</p>

<p>Also, for crises of conscience, &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; by Eliot. (&quot;Should I, after tea and cakes and ices / Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?&quot;)</p>

<p>On the French Revolution: Wordsworth&#39;s &quot;...Tintern Abbey.&quot; </p>

<p>So, like I said, famous poems, but not less affecting for it. Though much is taken, much abides. </p>

<p>Thanks for putting out the call! This was fun.</p></span>

Academic nit-pick I am, I went and added a distinction: Is listing “postmodern unreliable narrators” cheating? I mean, they’re playing off the assumption that all narrators are inherently unreliable, calling attention to said fact–then trying to trick you into thinking they’re conventionally fallable unreliable narrators, when they’re in fact conventionally unreliable unreliable narrators. Fascinating topic, but I’d like to add a wrinkle: Should we differentiate between narrators who know they’re unreliable and are trying to hoodwink their audience (Fight Club) and those who don’t and are being hoodwinked by their author (Lolita)? If so, does that make any difference in how we evaluate the novels? Because it should, I think, influence whether Humbert Humbert is the object of general or general and authorial condemnation; and if it does, those who scorn Nabokov’s “pornographic” novel can be declared, definitively and forevermore, not to “get it.” That Lolita-leap at the end may be unwarranted. (I don’t think the covertly diry-minded will ever admit that their minds produce what they find “in the novel.&quot;) But the question interests me. It’s fun, and I need fun–italics and all–as the quarter comes to a close.</span></a></div>

What can I say? &quot;One of those days&quot; has morphed into &quot;one of those weeks,&quot; but it will not snowball into &quot;one of those summers.&quot; ] As y'all know, I’m delivering a conference paper on the relationship of blogging and academia, and one of the points I want to address is the length and substance of blog posts. When I read piny's complaint about paragraph length, I pounced on the opportunity to defend my long-paragraphers. One respondent embodied the &quot;longist&quot; ideology. (Not to be confused with the antithetical &quot;longest&quot; ideology. This unfortunate phrasing has confused spectators at longist protests of longest events and vice versa. They try to disambiguate their positions by reducing their homophonic labels to the seemingly straightfoward &quot;I&quot; and &quot;E.&quot; Then the &quot;Unix First&quot; crowd drives up and what had merely &quot;confused&quot; the spectators becomes utterly inexplicable. On the main stage a longest contingent reenacts the infamous morality play &quot;Death of Sir Attention Span.&quot; To its left, a man with an &quot;I&quot; painted on his smooth chest is heard declaiming &quot;the hegemonic forces marshalled against brevity&quot; shortly before being engulfed by a huddle of penguins. As the play ends a young woman with an eye crudely silk-screened on her shirt hops on stage and warns everyone about Big Brother and his appetite for Your Personal Information. But boy howdy do I digress.) One longinista wrote: One long paragraph often means it was written and never edited. It is poor writing, since good writing is almost entirely editing and rewriting. I agree with the second half, but not the first. A long paragraph doesn’t necessarily mean it’s never been edited. If you were to walk into my classroom and ask my kids “What is writing?” they’d answer, in unison, “Writing is rewriting.” But they’ll still write long paragraphs when it’s appropriate. Here’s an example (stolen from the Writer-L listserv) I use in the classroom : I have the option of tuning out, half-listening, drifting about mentally while glancing around at the crowded and noisy dining room, watching almost simultaneously a sporting event being shown on television above the bar, an attractive blonde sitting sideways on a stool, and a fat man sitting at a nearby table with his mouth open, about to devour a piece of fish, a slender slice of flounder; and suddenly I imagine the fish coming to life, jumping off the fork, wiggling along the floor, and being retrieved by a waiter, who carries it in a napkin back to the kitchen, where I have visions of the fish swimming backward in time, a flashback fish floating freely ten days before in the Labrador Sea of northeastern Canada, a fish that is flat-bodied and pancake-size and has two eyes on the same side of its head, a Picasso fish, cruising easily along the muddy bottom of the sea in search of a...</span></a></div>
