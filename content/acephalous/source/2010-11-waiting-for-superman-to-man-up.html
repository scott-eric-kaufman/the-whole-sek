			<p>It goes without saying that Ben Shapiro’s <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/01/the-10-best-directors-in-hollywood.html">not a very talented writer</a>, but reading about <a href="http://benjaminshapiro.com/index.php/about">his achievements</a> leads me to despair for the future of America, because apparently it’s possible to graduate <em>summa cum laude</em> from one of the best schools in the best public university system in America and still <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/bshapiro/2010/11/05/america-loves-manly-men-not-metrosexual-emos/">write sentences like these</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More people will still shell out bucks to see Harrison  Ford (as long as he stops the metrosexual post-Calista Flockhart crap)  and Sean Connery than they will to see Robert Pattinson sans fangs.   It’s not because they’re old.  It’s because they’re <em>dudes</em>.  Men want to be them.  Women want to be with them.  They kick ass, take names, and don’t shave their chests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not about to defend Pattinson, but given that, prior to this  spasmodic outburst of cliché, he’d knocked other “metrosexual” actors  for failing to star in a commercially successful film recently, I feel  obliged to note that the <em>Twilight</em> films grossed the GDP of a  small country.  He may think writing “sans fangs” undercuts my  objection, but it doesn’t: there clearly is an audience for actors he  deems metrosexuals, as is evidenced by the fact that Shapiro can only  paint actors as unsuccessful <em>when he deliberately ignores their successful films</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Translation: since some of the highest grossing films of the past  decade don’t count, these actors are failures.  Put aside the fact that <em>most</em> films aren’t successful; put aside the fact that <em>anyone</em> would look like a failure if you disregarded their successes; put aside  the fact that Robert Downey Jr. is, without a doubt, a man with  “metrosexual” appeal whose two most recent successes were playing a  metrosexual tycoon and a homosocial detective; put all that aside for  the moment and concentrate the sheer stupidity with which he presented  his argument.  He <em>wants</em> to claim that audiences shun films with metrosexual actors or about metrosexual characters, but he <em>actually</em> claims that audiences shun them, except when they don’t.  When don’t  they?  Why, in all these extremely popular and profitable films, none of  which count because he doesn’t want them to.</p>
<p>Now, if he were an honest cultural critic, he’d be concerned with the  actual tastes of actual audiences and try to understand how they were  shaped, but he’s no more honest a cultural critic than he is talented a  writer.  That said, his failed sophistry distracted me from my original  topic, Superman, about whom Shapiro writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am constantly bemused by the attempt to re-set <em>Superman</em>.   The original comics are classic pieces of Americana.  The original  movie with Christopher Reeve was wonderful in almost every way—the first  forty minutes of the original <em>Superman</em> is pure magic.  And the  movie is true to the comic book sensibility: Superman is conflicted  about his identity, and wants to tell Lois the truth, but he’s also  supremely powerful and uncompromising about his defense of truth,  justice, and the American way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, no less of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Terror,_Batman%21">leading liberal light</a> than Frank Miller already <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563893428/diesekoschmar-20">exploded that version of Superman in 1986</a>; second, this is a child’s understanding of the character that even <a href="http://dcanimated.wikia.com/wiki/For_the_Man_Who_Has_Everything">the children’s show avoided</a>;  third, those clauses after the colon reveal the gross limitations of  Shapiro’s conservative imagination, in that they suggest that no one  who’s conflicted about their identity could defend American ideals.  I  wonder what his take on gays in the military is?</p>
<p>All kidding aside, Shapiro’s adamant that Superman occupy the same cultural space as Donna Reed <em>et al.</em> He must live in the perpetual twilight of an imaginary Golden Age in which</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Superman is sincere in his masculinity … doesn’t wax his chest [and] doesn’t whine about having to do his job[.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait—didn’t John Nolte just tell me that conservatives <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jjmnolte/2010/11/10/hollywood-reporter-pleasing-republican-necessary-for-big-league-tv-success/">hate <em>Mad Men</em></a>?  So why is Shapiro idealizing Draper?  Guess he didn’t get the memo.  Probably too busy writing about a book he hasn’t read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fast forward thirty years.  Now we’re hearing that DC Comics wants to reshape Superman.  According to the <em><a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/it_new_look_for_superman_wWxd8MApuHBFBmh0b3a4eK">New York Post</a></em> the Man of Steel will now be “a conflicted 20-year-old who’s trying to  find his way in the world … He wears hoodies, has smoldering eyes and,  as a lanky Clark Kent, wears low-cut pants and hipster skinny ties.”</p>
<p>Even more disturbingly, according to CNSNews.com, the new Superman  will be an emissary of the international way which presumably will be  more in line with multicultural norms and practices. “I was raised in  this country. I believe in this country,” Supermetroman will say.  “Does  it have its flaws? Yes. Does it have its moments of greatness? Yes.  Bottom line is, it’s my home and I’ll always carry those values around  with me. But if I do what I can do just for the U.S., it’s going to  destabilize the whole world. It could even lead to war.”</p>
<p>Yeah, that has best-seller written all-over it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, <a href="http://www.diamondcomics.com/public/default.asp?t=1&amp;m=1&amp;c=3&amp;s=237&amp;ai=102223&amp;ssd=">it does</a>,  and to return to my earlier point, if Shapiro honestly wanted to  understand the culture he’s so feebly critiquing, he’d account for that.   I’ll address the actual content of the book tomorrow, you know, like a  right proper cultural critic and all.</p>

<p>Also, if I recall correctly, there was a Superman/Swamp Thing crossover where Superman gets hit by a red-star plant thing that knocks him out and causes him to get very hairy, leading him to use his heat vision and a part of his space ship to shave his face and chest. </p></span>

(And they're Freudian!)</strong> With &quot;you&quot; being the creepy undergraduate behind me at Wahoo's Fish Tacos: Our Women's Studies class reminded me of the time last week when I was at this strip club, and this woman bent over and picked up a dollar bill with her vagina and I was like, &quot;Damn, she could be my mother!&quot; The young woman he was talking to was neither amused nor impressed by his revelation.</span></a></div>

Over the course of the conversation, which the man was secretly recording, Ploshnick never mentioned how, back in 1997, she’d thrown herself between her special education students and an out-of-control van and suffered severe injuries that still pain her today, nor did she mention the letter she received from President Clinton praising her for her actions that afternoon. She did inform the man that the state of tenure in New Jersey is such that she once witnessed another teacher—one who is not an award-winning, student-lives-saving special education teacher—yell “You nigger!” at a student, and that this other teacher was merely demoted. This man, who had plied her with drinks, as a professional journalist should, and recorded her words without her knowledge, as a professional journalist should, then brought the tape of Ploshnick recounting what happened to another teacher to James O’Keefe, who then posted it, with captions, on the Project Veritas Youtube channel. The relevant moment looks like this: In response to criticism that followed Ploshick being suspended and docked a pay raise for recounting what another teacher had said, Project Veritas posted a video in which it prefaced her comments with this: That’s right: O’Keefe and company claim that the word “nigger” is so volatile that there is no context capable of mitigating its appearance in response to a video in which they captioned someone thus: No context can mitigate its appearance, it seems, unless that context is “targeting an award-winning, student-lives-saving special education teacher for matters of political convenience.” Put differently: If you believe anything even resembling the title of this post, you are a terrible person and never to be taken seriously again.</span></a></div>
