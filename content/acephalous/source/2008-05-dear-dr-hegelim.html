<p>I had to spend some time reading about Hegel and comedy because of a <em>terrible</em> article on Twain and Hegel&#39;s definition of comedy.  The thing is, I didn&#39;t know it was terrible until <em>after</em> brushing up on ol&#39; G.W.F.H., by which point I&#39;d wasted an afternoon.  (Well, I <em>did</em> get a post out of it, so it wasn&#39;t a total loss, but still.)</p>

<p>JP,</p>

<p>No, I say, with thunder, because no one should have to spend that much time in that man&#39;s head.  Esp. not me.</p></span>

<p>&quot;The heir of a rich relative wishes to arrange a grave burial service, but complains that he doesn&#39;t suceed. The reason (so he says) is that &quot;the more money I give the mourners to look sad, the happier they  become&quot;. When we hear this story, we laugh out loud. &quot;</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>&quot;An Englishman at an Indian&#39;s table in Surat saw a bottle of ale being opened, and all the beer, turned to froth, rushed out. The Indian, by repeated exclamations, showed his great amazement. - Well, what&#39;s so amazing in that? asked the Englishman. - Oh, but I&#39;m not amazed at its coming out, replied the Indian, but how you managed to get it all in. - This makes us laugh, and it gives us a hearty pleasure.&quot;</p></span>

I don't mean &quot;conclusions&quot; as in &quot;concluding paragraphs,&quot; either. I mean &quot;conclusions&quot; as in &quot;what I think Twain is up to in the final chapter vis-a-vis race and American culture.&quot; On Tuesday, I found a pessimism tinged with commonplace racism more convincing. This morning, I'm inclined to consider his racism idiosyncratic and profound. To aid others who may be in a similar plight, I thought I might diagram my pain for general amusement edification. Coming to a conclusion in an academic essay is very much like looking at the red square pictured below. Stare at it until it pops: Now focus on the other red square until it does: Then first again: And the second: Now both simultaneously: Until it turns into one of these things: This would be your argument. It is unique and critical and it is genius. Your timely interrogation of &quot;box&quot; will not go unnoticed. The market rewards incisive interventions and yours will be no exception.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/05/internalizing-o.html"><span><strong>Internalizing Other's Marms May Be Hazardous To Your Health</strong> Consider the following sentence from George Levine's Darwin Loves You: &quot;Who,&quot; asks Max Weber, &quot;who—aside from certain big children who are indeed found in the natural sciences—still believes that the findings of astronomy, biology, physics, or chemistry could teach us anything about the meaning of the world?&quot; (33). It summoned my Inner Soltan.* Did Weber really write: Who who—aside from certain big children ... Of course he didn't. But I'll be damned if that second &quot;who&quot; didn't trip my alarms. Why? Because it doesn't exist! Levine has committed academic fraud! He inserted into the sentence a word which did not appear in the original! I know what you're thinking: &quot;Scott, he did it for the sake of elegance.&quot; I agree. The correct version is ugly: &quot;Who,&quot; asks Max Weber, &quot;[w]ho—aside from certain big children ... &quot; But it has the benefit of being correct. The incorrect version is merely superior prose and that's something for with up which I'll never stand put. *I recommend an Inner Soltan to anyone in a field in which the deportment of words is important. It pre-analyzes your prose and suggests the revisions required to keep the actual Soltan at bay. Very handy.</span></a></div>
