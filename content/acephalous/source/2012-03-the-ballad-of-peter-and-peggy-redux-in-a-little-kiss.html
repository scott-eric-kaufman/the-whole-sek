As I wrote in the post linked above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The viewer is looking at Peter looking at Peggy in the first&#0160;<a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48047" target="_self">medium close up</a>&#0160;in the scene.&#0160; (There is a slight unreality to this point of view shot: it zooms in on the pair in a way only cameras can.&#0160; The zooming seems to act as a cinematic proxy for attention or concentration.)&#0160; Slattery made sure the nearly invisible wall separating them remained visible, which creates a tension between the intimacy of the close up and the reality of the glass walls separating them.&#0160; That he chooses a more intimate when these two are in different rooms is, for obvious reasons, significant.&#0160; She sees him peering at her and, by its positioning, the camera acknowledges the bond that will remain despite the increasing distance between them: the baby they had together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But now Peter&#39;s a father, only not of Peggy&#39;s baby, but of his own. Who&#39;s screen presence exists as such:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0163037e8938970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Mad men00262" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0163037e8938970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0163037e8938970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mad men00262" /></a><br />See the baby? The one he had so he could be more like Draper? It&#39;s sitting there, frame central, hovering invisible in that tacky chair he should&#39;ve had the decency to replace if he&#39;d had any sense of style. He&#39;s <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/01/don-draper-as-an-unraptured-emma-bovary.html" target="_self">becoming Draper</a>–disappearing into the life he mistakenly believed he wanted. No children to greet him, just cold dinner and a warm shot of whisky. Don&#39;t believe me? Let&#39;s rewrind to the first season and remind you of a similarly framed shot:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e974c00f970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Mad men00297" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e974c00f970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e974c00f970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mad men00297" /></a><br />In this case, however, Betty&#39;s lying about going to the community center to watch them film the pool–she&#39;s off to watch pretty things die, as per the episode&#39;s title, for&quot;Sport.&quot;&#0160;But there&#39;s something more than sport to her deliberations. She wants to savor the experience of watching something die. First she feeds the children, then she does the laundry:</p>

Knowing that her idea is one that–whatever joy it might bring her, society would disapprove of, she ponders her decision for a moment:</p>

The fact that they&#39;re incapable of being centrally staged only <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/dark-knight-scene-analysis.html" target="_self">emphasizes their freedom</a>. The frame can&#39;t constrain them! They&#39;re free! If only Betty had an equivalently symbolic emblem of relinquishing societal constraints:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e974cb5d970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Mad men00333" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e974cb5d970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e974cb5d970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mad men00333" /></a><br />She does. Her feelings of entrapment are nothing a healthy dose of nicotine can&#39;t cure. Except why has she shifted stage-left? She had occupied the central portion of the screen, but now it&#39;s as if she&#39;s making room for something else. Whatever could that be?</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0163037ebf80970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Mad men00335" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0163037ebf80970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0163037ebf80970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mad men00335" /></a><br />Of course, she being an American, the only thing she can do with her symbol of freedom is shoot it with ... another symbol of her freedom. I wasn&#39;t able to capture her aiming the gun, which is why the space on the right side of the frame had to be cleared, but that&#39;s why it was. Oddly, her cigarette still occupies the central portion of the frame, as if, like the nicotine it delivers into her blood, is calming her down, making her transgressive violence possible. Can&#39;t be sure. However, visually speaking, the indication is that Draper&#39;s created/creating a sociopath, and the implication is that Peter&#39;s following a similar path. He began his morning commutes in &quot;A Little Kiss,&quot; you&#39;ll remember, alone and engrossed in a paper:</p>
<p>&#0160; <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0163037ec328970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Mad men00120" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0163037ec328970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0163037ec328970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mad men00120" /></a></p>
<p>His loneliness is highlighted by both the empty chair beside him and the man with the solitaire board across from him. By episode&#39;s end, things seem a bit different, though:</p>

See, Scott's new phone only came with a car charger, so he had to drive somewhere and being an English teacher, decided to go to the library. While there, some punk added all y'all while Scott refreshed his water at the Corona public bottle refilling stations, and though he remembers you all with great fondness, because of all the wonderful memories he shared with each and every one of you, he's not sure you want to listen to his each and every joyous exclamation or deadening complaint–of which there are very, very many–and so if you decide to decline 'his' invitation, he will be in no way offended. In short, social media leaves no good ground for graceful exits, so here's Scott trying his best. (Yes, this is what that looks like.) That said, if you've a particularly good burn you'd like turned conflagration before declining his request, he'd love to hear/smell/asphyxiate because of it ... so long as you allow him (or his next of kin) to re-use it should a similar situation some day arrise. Best, Scott P.S. More on Pete and Peggy, as promised, in &quot;A Little Kiss,&quot; shortly. P.P.S. To those who said &quot;At least it wasn't about that other thing,&quot; remember that earlier in the week it was. Only literally.</span></a></div>

This has caused me no end of problems, for which I apologize. However, if you received a text, phone call, tweet, or email from me tonight apologizing for this indiscretion, know that it was sincere, and that I'll do my best to make amends, as best I can, in the coming months. If you choose to believe otherwise–that my intent was malicious–all I can say is look at the life I've lived the past eight years, then stare into my eyes and declare that I've reason to have done this to myself.</span></a></div>
