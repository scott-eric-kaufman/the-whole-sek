<p>Instead, I will marvel at the <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NWM4ZjhmOTg4NzExZTM4MzdlOGUyZDBiNTIwZGIyMmE=&amp;w=Mg==">stentorian stupidity</a> of <a href="http://www.kirkcenter.org/bios/georgenash.html">George H. Nash</a>,
who received a degree in History from Harvard in 1973 then promptly

<blockquote><p>Theodore Roosevelt to Franklin Roosevelt to the Kennedys
and Camelot, American liberalism has repeatedly succumbed to this
phenomenon. It begins in a cult of personality, extends to the leader’s
wife and children, and then to a “court” of retainers and apologists.</p></blockquote>
<p>The royalists, then, are not the ones descended from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Rockwell">state representative</a> of Massachusetts’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts%27s_7th_congressional_district">7th district</a>—they are the descendants of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Kennedy_%281823%E2%80%931858%29">impoverished Irish immigrant</a>
that man represented from 1849 to 1851. That bears repeating: the
son-in-law of William Walker, Julius Rockwell, represented Patrick
Kennedy in the U.S. House of Representatives from the moment Kennedy
disembarked in 1849 until Rockwell resigned 1851 <em>and the only worrisome political royalty Nash can locate here are the Kennedys</em>?</p>
<p>Granted, the family to whom he extends this cultish devotion is
direct, “the leader’s wife and children,” so emphasis on the children
of the Joseph Kennedy, Sr. is warranted: Joseph Jr., John, Robert and
Edward are all direct descendants of a single powerful personage, as
are the relatives in his other example, the pair of fifth cousins
connected by a great-great-great-great-grandfather, Nicholas Van
Rosenvelt, upon whose death in 1742 the family splintered into the
Republican Oyster Bay and the Democratic Hyde Park Roosevelts.</p>
<p>Wait—now I’m confused.</p>
<p>Not only are the Roosevelts distant cousins instead of sons or
brothers, they also belong to opposing factions of a family that’s been
at political odds since before the Revolutionary War. How exactly are
Republicans who voted for Theodore and Democrats who voted Franklin
Delano symptomatic of American liberalism? Moreover, since Nash wants
to talk about cults of personality extending to wives and children and
courtiers, how could he not mention the two-term Connecticut Senator, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott_Bush">Prescott Bush</a>, whose son, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush">George Herbert Walker Bush</a>, and grandson, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">George Walker Bush</a>, were both President? Does he believe the royalist inclinations of American liberalism are responsible for the Bushes?</p>
<p>Probably not, because this insidious royalism “starts in
hero-worship and ends in nostalgia,” and beloved as both Bushes are,
neither are afforded the “disturbing” and “disconcerting” treatment
“that for nearly a century has afflicted American liberalism.” Anything
that “starts in hero-worship and ends in nostalgia” threatens the body
politic with an idiot malignance . . . as Nash himself proves when he
starts the first paragraph of his essay with some hero-worship and ends
it with nostalgia:</p>
<blockquote><p>On March 30, 1981, Pres. Ronald Reagan was nearly
assassinated. What if he had died that day, before he had persuaded
Congress to enact his signature program of tax cuts? Would his liberal
opposition on Capitol Hill have given up their philosophical opposition
to his agenda? Would they have stood silent if militant conservatives
had tried to rush through sweeping tax-cut legislation as a monument to
Reagan’s legacy?</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation:</p>
<blockquote><p>“What if the Great Hero had died in 1981? Would the Golden Age for which I now pine have ever come to be?”</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe he was better off pretending two of the four most recent
Presidents weren’t immediate kin—at least then he made my job a wee bit
difficult.</p><p>(<em><a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/next-week-george-nash-will-bemoan-the-fact-that-weve-never-had-a-white-president/">x-posted</a></em>.)</p>

When I search for such services online, all I find is an endless sea of spam. There must be somewhere—perhaps localized at the level of individual schools—that students go to make these sorts of arrangements. Would it not be incredibly useful for instructors to know what those sites/forums/IRC chat rooms are? (And isn't it odd that there hasn't already been some sort of collective effort to create a list of this type?) If you know the locations of some of these sites, I would love it if you left the address in the comment or send me an email (scotterickaufman at gmail dot com). Anonymous is fine. I want to create a sort of master list so I can play Leverage in my spare time because I'm curious. UPDATE 1. The answer, from my initial investigations, is that it's not craigslist. I found a few ads there, but after a brief investigation, learned that they were all spam.</span></a></div>

He accuses Michiko Kakutani of plagiarizing his 2008 blockbuster, &quot;The Improvised Odyssey of Barack Obama,&quot; and begins his defense of this claim as one does: by demonstrating that William Ayers is familiar with Homer's Odyssey. Ayers knows his Homer. In his 2001 memoir, Fugitive Days, for instance, he specifically identified the Odyssey's &quot;Cyclops&quot; as a metaphor for the &quot;doomed and helpless&quot; United States. &quot;Picture an oversized, somewhat dim-witted monster, greedy and capricious,&quot; Ayers wrote in his uniquely patriotic way, &quot;its eyes put out by fiery stakes and now flailing in a blind rage, smashing its way through villages and over mountains.&quot; If, as Cashill hopes to establish, &quot;Ayers knows his Homer,&quot; it would behoove him not to quote Ayers saying that Odysseus put out the eyes of the famously one-eyed monster Polyphemus. That Ayers speaks of a stereoscopic cyclops speaks ill of him; that Cashill attempts to establish both his own and Ayers's classicist credibility via a quotation about a two-eyed cyclops only proves that neither should be trusted with Homeric parallels. (Leave that to the experts.) Then, as if he anticipated the complaint of the previous sentences, he politely offers evidence of their validity: In Dreams, Obama confronts his own menacing one-eyed bald man, a Savak-loving Iranian. Obama once spoke with a one-eyed man, Cashill argues, therefore this reference to a one-eyed cyclops in Dreams From My Father corresponds with Ayers's reference to a two-eyed one in Fugitive Days. Granted, my summary of his point may be uncharitably literal, even though Obama's one-eyed man had, to all appearances, two eyes (&quot;an older balding man with a glass eye,&quot; the &quot;drift of [which] gave the Iranian a menacing look&quot;); and even though the point of Obama telling this story is that, despite one of the man's two eyes giving him &quot;a menacing look,&quot; he &quot;was a friendly and curious&quot; person; and even though, unlike the Odyssey, in which the curse of the one-eyed cyclops Polyphemus results in his father, Poseidon, to unleash contrary winds and furious storms, thereby extending the travels and travails of Odysseus, all that resulted from this conversation was that someone else quoted Malcolm X; even though all those parallels break down, maybe I am being uncharitably literal. Once the sentence I quoted above is inserted back into its context, the parallels between Homer's epic and Obama's memoir become clear: In Dreams, Obama confronts his own menacing one-eyed bald man, a Savak-loving Iranian. Before he completes his heroic cycle, he also confronts many of the other distractions: green-eyed seductresses, blind seers, lotus-eaters, the &quot;ghosts&quot; of the underworld, whirlpools, and about a half dozen sundry &quot;demons.&quot; Obama, as scripted by Ayers, lived the most Odysseus-esque life of anyone ever. I never even knew he went to the underworld! But our President is even...</span></a></div>
