<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>STUDENT: </strong>It was called a horror class.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SEK: </strong>The emphasis was on the creation of suspense.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>STUDENT: </strong><em>Saw II </em>was suspenseful.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SEK: </strong>Suspenseful torture porn, which if you were paying attention during the few classes you actually attended, you&#39;d have remembered that that&#39;s a genre I repeatedly specified we&#39;d be avoiding.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>STUDENT: </strong>Some teachers don&#39;t push &#39;em hard enough.&#0160; Who has &#39;em aiming at barns and all when they could be shooting at aliens and shit?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SEK: </strong>Just so I have this straight: in Week Four you decided to up the rhetorical ante by chasing aliens and what you captured were the barely legible fears of a child forced to rewatch <em>SAW II </em>until someone produced an essay you deemded &quot;college enough&quot; to turn in.&#0160; Am I missing something here?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>STUDENT: </strong>But is there still something I could to do pass the cl—</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SEK: </strong>No.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SEK: </strong>No.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>STUDENT: </strong>I have a friend—</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef015432fc4044970c-content"><p>I always identify more with the students than with the instructor in these stories.  Why shouldn&#39;t the student skip six weeks of class?  Class is boring.  I skipped a lot more than that, and when I came in after long disappearances, I never bothered to make up &quot;stuff and things&quot; excuses.  Admittedly, these were generally science and math classes where the teachers didn&#39;t know any students anyways and in which the test scores were what generally mattered.  My main concern was identifying when the midterm would be so I could come in on that day, although once I missed it and made it up the next day.</p>

<p>I think that Student&#39;s problem is this case was that they just didn&#39;t have the skills (i.e. imitative facility and general intelligence of the kind that academia values) to pull this off.  They actually got you to look at their make-up essay.  If it had been above-average, you probably would have let them skate by.</p></span>

Unlike what Rich is describing in math/science classes (which I don&#39;t agree should be the case either), comp classes are like foreign language classes where practicing every day to keep up skills and fluency is important. I wouldn&#39;t even have looked at the draft, just shown the place in my syllabus that says the student will have an F after so many absences. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e891d3475970d-content"><p>I just had a student who wrote a term paper for a Constitutional Law course that asked him to analyze the antecedents and consequences of a seminal SCOTUS case that didn&#39;t mention constitutional law or one SCOTUS case. What amazes me is that he&#39;s very confused as to why he didn&#39;t pass the class.</p>

<p>A closely related phenomenon is the student who is there for every day of class, who turns in all assignments, and participates in class, but just doesn&#39;t have what it takes to pass. I was that student once and I have a &quot;D&quot; in sophomore macro-economics to prove it.</p>

<p>Please post the outraged entry at ratemyprofessor when you get the chance.</p></span>

He wasted your time and I can&#39;t believe he thought he could plead his case and you would cave-in and give him a grade.  I guess he did not know your reputation - coming to class after getting hit by a car; coming to class ill and coming to class after kidney stone surgery.  Having other instructors cover for you so that students get the attention you feel is necessary for them to get what they paid for - an education necessary to continue their education.  I am proud of the person you have become and they way yu impact students.</p></span>

If that were actually the case, then allowing the student to make up a quarter&#39;s worth of work in the next quarter seems reasonable.  In the absence of a legit reason, of course an F is what one earns when one blows off a course in such spectacular fashion.  But my main points were that in neither situation is it reasonable to expect to make up a quarter&#39;s worth of work in Week 10, and furthermore that I almost certainly would not have had the SEK-like forbearance required to engage in an extended discussion with the student about it.</p></span>

He is on his way to office hours. CAR: YAAAAAAWN! All of the electricity in CAR disappears and now SEK and SLEEPING CAR are coasting uphill at the speed of impending panic. SEK depresses the gas pedal and wakes CAR up. CAR: Did you say something? SEK: What was that back there? CAR: What was what back where? SEK: That yawn and— CAR: You mean CAR's micronap? CAR does that now. Micronaps are cool. SEK: Micronaps are not co— CAR: YAAAAAAWN! All of the electricity in CAR vanishes again and again SEK and SLEEPING CAR are coasting uphill at the speed of impending panic. SEK depresses the gas pedal and wakes CAR up. Again. SEK: You did it again! CAR: Did what? SEK: Fell asleep! CAR: Did not! SEK: One more word from you and I'm pulling you over! CAR: But— SEK: Enough! SEK pulls CAR over and looks at it sternly. After a few minutes, SEK reenters CAR and looks at its lying dashboard with a crooked eye. CAR: You know you're gonna be late for office hours. SEK: I know that. Shut up. CAR: Those kids are gonna think you let them down. SEK: I KNOW. CAR: Go ahead. Turn CAR on. SEK: I'm not turning you on. CAR: Just slip your key in CAR's ignition and— SEK: SHUT UP. CAR: You know you wan— SEK caves to CAR's inappropriately expressed demands and carefully drives to campus. Once there, he locates a mechanic who can set CAR straight and informs his students that office hours will be delayed until 2 p.m. It is now 2:30 p.m. and SEK is talking with a MECHANIC. SEK: I thought you said CAR would be ready by 2 p.m. MECHANIC: CAR? No, CAR needed a part, so I had it towed to Riverside. In the background, unseen by SEK, CAR moves across the stage from right-to-left, emphatically waving goodbye to everbody. SEK: You towed CAR to Riverside? MECHANIC: We thought it'd be more convenient for you, since you live in Corona. SEK: How am I supposed to get back to class? MECHANIC: We can call you a cab. SEK: And what about after class? MECHANIC: Just get your wife to pick you up. SEK: But CAR is our only car. MECHANIC: CAR is your only car? SEK: CAR is. MECHANIC: You want I should tow CAR back now? SEK: Very much so, thank you. In the background, unseen by SEK, CAR moves across the stage from left-to-right, emphatically waving hello to everybody. MECHANIC: Here CAR is, good as exactly the same! Try not to drive CAR up steep incline between now and tomorrow when part from Riverside arrive. CAR: (to SEK) CAR was gonna go on a field trip! SEK: Your services were needed elsewhere. CAR: (despondently) Back to campus then, are we? SEK shoots CAR a wilting look, and CAR deflates...</span></a></div>
