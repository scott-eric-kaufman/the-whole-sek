There is evidence that someone sent emails to Jeff using my name at this time, and those of you who know me and can recognize my style can judge for yourself whether I wrote this email from an account I don't have. (Those of you with whom I've corresponded can search your emails and see if I've ever sent you anything from a non-Gmail or non-UCI account. You'll see that I haven't.)

In late 2009 or early 2010 I began to receive similarly unhinged emails from someone claiming to be &quot;Jeff&quot; from &quot;proteinwisdom.com.&quot; I asked this person to stop sending me emails. He did not. After this persisted, instead of repeating the annoying trials of 2006, I simply had a friend, a former grad student with a law degree, send Jeff Goldstein a cease-and-desist letter. I sent it to the address he&#39;d provided me when he wanted me to send him a free book. For the purpose of verification, that address looks like this:
<blockquote>
<p>5*** P****** C*****<br />
F******** C* 8****.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope that establishes I sent the letter to the correct place without actually revealing the actual address, as I&#39;m not the sort of person who posts private emails or home addresses or cell-phone numbers on the Internet. (All of which has been done to me, including quite recently by <em>you-know-who</em>.) The vile emails continued for another week or two, then stopped. I assumed that the cease-and-desist letter had taken awhile to arrive but had finally done its job, and given that I didn&#39;t want to have anything else to do with Goldstein, I considered the matter settled. I did, however, make a mistake in mentioning that I&#39;d sent this letter to Patrick Frey without explicitly indicating that I&#39;d rather it remain private. And I wanted it remain private with good reason: the harassment had stopped and I didn&#39;t want it to resume. </p>
<p>For reasons unclear to me, Goldstein claims not have been the one harassing me or the person who stopped harassing me after I sent the letter. That&#39;s just a big coincidence. As I have no evidence to the contrary, I suppose I&#39;ll just have to take his word for it. There is evidence that someone sent emails to Jeff using my name at this time, and those of you who know me and can&#0160; recognize my style can judge for yourself whether I wrote <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=43886#comment-917542" target="_self">this email</a> from an account I don&#39;t have. (Those of you with whom I&#39;ve corresponded can search your emails and see if I&#39;ve ever sent you anything from a non-Gmail or non-UCI account. You&#39;ll see that I haven&#39;t.) <em></em>Here&#39;s the thing: now Jeff demands to see the emails that I never publicly claimed he sent. </p>
<p>But I don&#39;t have them anymore. Jeff thinks this is &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/proteinwisdom/status/251752240887504898" target="_self">convenient</a>,&quot; which is indicative of his paranoid mental state, since I have informed him—as well as all of you, in not <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/01/prove-your-love-youve-got-to-prove-your-love.html" target="_self">one place</a> <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/01/prove-your-love-youve-got-to-prove-your-love" target="_self">but two</a>—that my computer died last January. (And thank all of you for chipping in to buy me another.) He believes I &quot;conveniently&quot; murdered my computer last January to avoid ever having to provide him with information in September. The truth is, I lost a wealth of information last January, including a good three years of emails I&#39;d downloaded from the Gmail server. Why would I download them? Why not just leave them all up on Gmail servers to be there forever? <em><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/02/scott-eric-kaufmans-visual-rhetoric-compendium-as-of-11282011.html" target="_self">Because I teach visual rhetoric</a></em>. Which means <em>every quarter</em> I receive multiple drafts from hundreds of students that include large image files and embedded films. So I&#39;m regularly compelled to download emails off the Gmail servers to preseve space and lost many of them when my computer died in January. </p>
<p>All of which—by which I mean all of these things that are in the public record and have been for months and years—Jeff finds <em>very suspicious</em>. That says all you need to know about him and concludes all I&#39;m going to say about this.</p>
<p>Except for one last thing: the person who claims not to have harrassed me a few years ago has sent me 38 messages on Twitter<em> in the past hour</em>. I take it this is his version of &quot;making the case&quot; that he doesn&#39;t harass people, because he doesn&#39;t seem to realize that his performance undermines his message. </p>
<p>*Google &quot;Troll of Constant Sorrow&quot; if you&#39;re interested in more on that. Which you shouldn&#39;t be. </p>

There's no history of American cinema in which Native Americans were a violent bulwark against the tide of civilizing white men eager to manifest their destiny. There's no history of American literature in which Native Americans played the roles of &quot;Captor #1&quot; and &quot;Captor #2&quot; and let's just call them &quot;Tribe of Captors&quot; in popular captivity narratives that identified war-whooping with lady-taking and child-killing. None of that is real because Ann Althouse said so: Someone doing the &quot;tomahawk chop&quot; is himself playing the role of Indian. This Indian character making a stereotypical gesture can't be read as expressing hostility toward Indians. The Indian is his hero. See? &quot;The Indian is his hero.&quot; Whose hero exactly? According to Althouse anyone doing the tomahawk chop. Which means that she believes that performing a racially offensive can't be considered racist because the performance itself is necessarily an act of loving emulation. For example, if one of Scott Brown's white staffers were to create a television show called It couldn't be considered racist by definition because its use of the stereotypical Chinese immigrant is evidence of that this white staffer considers Chin-Kee to be &quot;his hero.&quot; In all seriousness, Althouse's problem is that she's so ignorant that she doesn't realize that the stereotype of Native Americans that Brown's staffers invoke isn't historically accurate, which is why she can claim, straight-faced, that &quot;these fake Indians, the staffers, are pretending to be real Indians,&quot; when in actuality they're pretending to be racist stereotypes of Native Americans. One day I will wake up in a world in which &quot;Ann Althouse&quot; is revealed to be the work of an art collective trying to win a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for the Longest Sustained Installation of a Person Who Couldn't Possibly Exist. I pray that day comes soon. In the meantime go read my other post. It'll cleanse this stupid clear off your palate.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/09/game-of-thrones-winter-is-coming-for-will-and-bran.html"><span><strong>Game of Thrones: &quot;Winter Is Coming&quot; for Will and Bran</strong> (This is yet another one of those visual rhetoric posts that's born of this frightenining imminent course.) You'll recall that according to the first post, Van Patten made Will a sympathetic deserter and oath breaker; according to the second, Van Patten established the family dynamic through Bran's perspective; according to the third, Bran remained the focal point because everyone believed themselves to be acting in his best interest; and according to the fourth and final post in this series, which would be this one, we'll finally witness the &quot;punchline&quot; of the preceding scenes. To begin: The scene shifts from inside Winterfell to somewhere outside it. It's difficult to tell exactly where because there's a notched log occupying the majority of the frame. Why the log? Because Will's world is now the size of its notch. His world closes in on him as his death nears, so it makes sense that his purview, visually speaking, follows suit. It momentarily expands into an extreme long shot when he believes he's found an excuse that might could maybe save him: But only momentarily: Note contrast between these two shots: in the first, the camera is at a distance and captures a large swath of the highlands that are bright despite the mist blanketing them; in the second, the camera tightens in and centers on Will in a medium close-up, and the compositional structure is oppressive: he is flanked on both sides by armed guard and the hill behind doesn't, as the one in previous shot did, suggest freedom so much as unscaleable-rock-that-might-as-well-be-a-wall. He's trapped within the structure of the shot, and the medium close-up reminds us of the fear and pain we saw on his face when he was captured: The irony of being imprisoned on an open field is more apparent in the above because the framing is looser, but it's essentially the same shot as the one in which he confesses his oath-breaking with one important exception: when he confesses to have broken his oath, he knows all hope is lost. In the shot above, the possibility of escape still exists, if not on that field, then possibly through pardon—hence his mentioning the white walkers two frames previous. But by the time he enters that structurally oppressive medium close-up, he knows his fate. As do the other characters in the scene, and more importantly, the extent to which they sympathize with is indicated by the distance of the camera from their faces. This may seem like a simple means of identifying a complex emotional response, but it has a long history in film theory, the short version of it goes something like this: Films used to be silent. Because actors couldn't tell us what they were thinking and many directors found intertitles aesthetically unappealing, the close-up on actors' faces became the preferred means of communicating their emotions. The heightened expressiveness evident in the close-up compelled audiences to pay more attention to the micro-expressions written upon the actors' faces, which made directors...</span></a></div>
