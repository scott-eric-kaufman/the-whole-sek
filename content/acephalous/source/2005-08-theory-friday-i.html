<p>It bothers me that literary critics can establish careers on an oppositional position without ever having to think through the implications of their arguments.&nbsp; It reminds me too much of Socialists, Communists and Stalinists in the 1920s who, unlike the anti-Stalinist Socialists, chose to ignore evidence of the purges so that they might continue to fight the good fight in the hallways of Harvard and Columbia.&nbsp; That's unfair.&nbsp; (And also intrudes on David Horowitz's lunatic territory.&nbsp; However, I have a point; he has a jeremiad.)&nbsp; My point is simply that much of what passes for &quot;Theory&quot; in literature departments stake a wholly oppositional claim, one which never demands a positive platform, because for more than 25 years they haven't been forced to think through what their position entails.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/theorys_empire_ersatz_theoretical_ecumenicalism_criticism_qua_criticism/">They should be</a>.</p>

<p>I've been on the verge of &quot;the other hand&quot; for some time now.&nbsp; Here it is:</p>

<p>On the other hand, after aligning contemporary &quot;theory&quot; with the women's and civil rights movements that everyone with a smattering of history (<em>i.e. </em>not our students) knows preceded it by at least a decade, Andy announces theory's sole ownership of &quot;skepticism towards systems, institutions, and norms.&quot;&nbsp; It's also cornered the market on critical stands and engagements in resistance.&nbsp; What Andy's done is deny the New Critics their day in the oppositional sun and trumpeted the power of theory.&nbsp; But wait!&nbsp; I'm a liar!&nbsp; I havent' even reached the introduction yet: all of this information and obfuscation's actually in the Preface!</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will stop lying and discuss the introduction, which merits its own discussion.&nbsp; My point here, as I think will become increasingly clear on the morrow, is that Matt's correct: there's a real problem with the introduction to <em>Theory's Empire</em>.&nbsp; But though I agree, I will expand his argument to encompass the genre of introductions, and I'll demand he read the essays in <em>Theory's Empire</em> instead of the terrible introduction.&nbsp; I will insist that he carefully read my contribution to the event (linked to above, around, and all over the place), and ask him whether he thinks I'm being unfair to the claims of theorists.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(I will then apologize to Matt for forcing him to read a really long essay by demanding he do so in a public venue.&nbsp; Then I'll concede that my tactics were cheap but I really think he should see whether I'm attacking Theory <em>qua</em>, um, theory?&nbsp; Theory?)</p>

<p>[Cross-posted, you know, over there.&nbsp; Where else would it be?&nbsp; You think I can just cross-post stuff anywhere?]</p>

To respond to Mike's question about the icy reception of my latest offering on the Valve, I can only say this: John Bruce is a lunatic. I've said this before in a more entertaining manner (and once in a most entertaining manner). Quite frankly, the man's issues have little to do with me. Case in point: he's already written another screed, this time against Rich and I. (I'll let Rich defend himself, as he is more than capable of doing so.) The sheer stupidity and intellectual dishonesty for which Bruce is so deservedly known surfaces again. To wit: I'm taken to task for choosing to be known by my entire name. (Because I haven't explained that before.) My responses to his palaver aren't monumentally unsubtle mockeries but &quot;copious and near hysterical reactions.&quot; The etiology of his confusion baffles me. It may be that he can't recognize knee-to-balls satire and makes an honest but deeply stupid mistake. Or it may be that he can recognize it and chooses not to seem to because to do so would be terribly unflattering. The thing is, once you have your audience debating whether you're an idiot or dishonest, well, what's the point of continuing? Now, I have to take issue with Matt, whose wrongness is wronger than any wrong has been wrong before: Oblivion is a wonderful collection. (Full disclosure: I've written, poorly, on Infinite Jest before.) The focus on corporate culture works pays off precisely because it refuses to partake of the &quot;pity the poor white-collar slave&quot; narrative so common now in contemporary fiction. (David Grand, I enjoyed your novel, but I'm still looking at you.) The significant thing about David Foster Wallace--not mentioned, I'm obliged to add, in Bruce's roster of those known by three names--is that his gimmicks should be tired by now. In literary historical terms, he should be the footnote he so loves. But he isn't. Oblivion is a masterful. Every one of his novels, if nothing else, is a compendium of pithy description. (From Oblivion, &quot;rorschach shubbery&quot; springs to mind.) Not that I prefer it to Infinite Jest. No book has embodied the Whole Sick Crew's &quot;be cool, but care&quot; mantra better than Infinite Jest. (I may have even said that before.) Cam, I'm glad you didn't sneak a glance at Lyle Lovett's member. If you had you'd be no better than Larry David, who didn't so much as glance but stared at Muggsy Bogues' member. You, my friend, have bathroom etiquette. Matt and Rich: your discussion will be discussed in a future post. The short answer is that I'm sticking to my guns. I believe that the debates over the legitimacy of theory produced far more sophisticated approaches to literature than current &quot;debates&quot; do. Which means that I agree with Matt on the uselessness of much of contemporary...</span></a></div>

Gyronny!  Huzzah!</strong> This isn't an actual entry. It's only an annoyance with the OED's definition of &quot;geruda&quot;: Of an escutcheon: Divided into or having gyrons; gyronny of eight, having eight gyrons, i.e. each quarter divided diagonally by lines meeting in the fesse-point. I just want to extend my thanks and appreciation to the OED for the absolute uselessness of that definition...bah, ugh, fie or something.</span></a></div>
