This isn't the case so much anymore, though, because the conversation's have disappeared: if you link to something I write on Facebook, the uptick in traffic alerts me to the fact that I've written something that's being read, but I can't participate in the conversation, which not only strikes me as a strange -- inasmuch as I'm being excluded from conversations I've started -- but also creates an occasionally inhibiting paranoia. I know people are talking about something I've written, but I'm structurally excluded from that conversation. I like to imagine that if I wanted to join it, I'd be welcomed, but only because it's a comforting thesis that I can't disprove.

<p>I think it&#39;s wrong to blame Facebook alone for this. Really what&#39;s happening is that conversation space is fragmenting across a bunch of different platforms and cultural spaces, just as other media spaces and audience experiences have fragmented. The main bad thing about Facebook is what Kathleen says: you can&#39;t pull conversations out of it, unlike many of the other social media spaces where responses might be happening.</p>

<p>But blogs are still generating the &quot;root content&quot; that feeds a lot of reaction and discussion in those spaces (locked or not) so they still matter. The bloggers themselves just aren&#39;t as sure of what people are saying--kind of like old media writers weren&#39;t sure...</p></span>

But as to where to discuss it, that&#39;s interesting precisely because we&#39;re &quot;new media&quot; people learning to deal with the problems of audience that the &quot;old media&quot; people have wrestled with for years. Part of it is, I think, that we were spoiled by the robustness of our commenting communities, and secretly believe that they&#39;re still out there, only in some wilds inaccessible to us.</p>

<p>Moreover, for me at least, the audiences are different in kind: having one set of commenters on one blog and another on another isn&#39;t quite the same as having unknown audiences. Which is annoying as a writer, because how can you appeal to an audience you don&#39;t know? </p></span>

<p>Most days, I barely know what I think about stuff unless I search my own site. (Did I like that film? I think I remember liking it, etc.)</p>

<p><em>People like comments but hate commenters.</em></p>

<p>Bloggers like commenters, though, until there are too many of them. I wouldn&#39;t say I prefer commenters who agree with me, though, so much as I enjoy having a manageable number of commenters to disagree with. Too many and it&#39;s impossible to conduct a useful conversation. (The subtext, obviously, is post-as-classroom, but not one in which I impart wisdom, but more like a grad seminar in which I can acquire genuinely new knowledge. Or something like that.)</p>

<p><em>Facebook avoids the problem of disliking what your commenters write because disagreement is discouraged.</em></p>

<p>This confuses me. On Facebook, old friends fight with family members over the latest Obama outrage, so the difference seems to me that if we argue with strangers on the Internet, the upside is that we don&#39;t have to see them at reunions.</p>

<p><em>It&#39;s a lot harder to maintain a pseudonym in comment systems which are increasingly tied to FB, and other cookie-based memory systems. </em></p>

<p>It&#39;s well-nigh impossible, isn&#39;t it? An otherwise friendless person who only comments on blogs with Facebook comments will be flagged as spam, won&#39;t they?</p></span>

<p>This is obviously a key part of this conversation that doesn&#39;t seem to have been addressed yet: people want to comment, not only where they already have relationships with the other readers and commenters, but where the number of other commenters/readers is at a sweet spot somewhere south of, say, the NY Times, and somewhere north of some dude&#39;s blogspot blog that he maintains for a readership of five people. </p>

<p>Where the readership is too large or too small, commenting is unsatisfying. Which is one of the things facebook seems to have going for it: your community of fellow readers is dictated by your own social circle, and they&#39;re all people with whom you have a relationship. The main problem, of course, is that the author is not automatically part of the group.</p>

<p>I&#39;m way out of the loop on current standards for online IDs and commenting systems, but aren&#39;t there some open and open-source standards for this? Trackbacks, OpenID, something? I&#39;ve never commented on anything posted on facebook, so I&#39;m obviously an outlier.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0167689773f1970b-content"><p>A couple thoughts:</p>

<p>1) At some point, probably 2009-10, I stopped reading blogs which didn&#39;t fall into one of two categories (a) blogs where I had a good sense of the commenters and the tenor of the conversation (e.g., unfogged or even Brad DeLong) or (b) blogs in which the comment section wasn&#39;t an important part of the blog (Ezra Kein or Matt Yglesias). But trying to get to know a new comment section (say when I click over to your posts at LGM) just felt like work. </p>

<p>I wonder if there&#39;s less experimentation going on now in the relationship between bloggers and commenters -- if people are familiar enough with blogging that most bloggers already have a sense in their heads of what a good comment section looks like and either try to maintain that or give up on that. For whatever reason it feels like there is a tendency for blog comment sections to be one of nonexistent, chatty and personal, or busy an impersonal.</p>

<p>2) I thought about this post when I was reading <a href="http://www.cjr.org/feature/piecemeal_existence.php?page=all" rel="nofollow">this article</a> about the ways in which freelance blogging is becoming a normal step in the career path of aspiring journalists/writers. I wonder if, these days, more of the blogosphere is made of people who&#39;s motives are fundamentally careerist. Obviously running an active blog is a LOT of work, and nobody with a demanding job will do it unless they think it benefits their job in some way, but it could reasonable change the tone of the median blog if people are explicitly thinking of the blog as their writing portfolio / freelance job.</p></span>

<p>I think what you say after that is true -- it was quicker to quote the introduction to your points than the points themselves -- but I&#39;ll focus on that boundary between a NY Times morass and a Livejournal blog, because I abide in it. This blog isn&#39;t over personal, in that you don&#39;t need to know me to read a post about Mad Men, but it&#39;s oddly personal, because of my penchant for dramatizing my life to humorous effect. I think one of the reasons commenting here is down is simply that there&#39;s no protocol for commenting at a place like this. </p>

<p><em>For whatever reason it feels like there is a tendency for blog comment sections to be one of nonexistent, chatty and personal, or busy an impersonal.</em></p>

<p>I think this is dead-on, and it&#39;s a shame, because it used to not be the case. I wrote another version of this post as I was going through my own archives for the &quot;Best of...&quot; posts, and I could definitely see a change in the tenor of the comments. So many of the people who comment now are &quot;first time commenters,&quot; which means I&#39;ve pulled them from the wool work, but they&#39;re rarely &quot;second time commenters.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Obviously running an active blog is a LOT of work, and nobody with a demanding job will do it unless they think it benefits their job in some way, but it could reasonable change the tone of the median blog if people are explicitly thinking of the blog as their writing portfolio / freelance job.</em></p>

<p>And by &quot;change the tone,&quot; I think you mean &quot;eliminate,&quot; which is why those &quot;authorless&quot; posts invite nothing so much as projection: the comments either aren&#39;t there, because who wants to talk to a non-entity, or it&#39;s all invective, because who the fuck cares if they offend a non-entity?</p></span>

Meanwhile, the National Park Service, administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior, asks us to 'Please Do Not Feed the Animals.' Their stated reason for the policy is because the animals will grow dependent on handouts and will not learn to take care of themselves. This ends today’s lesson. It originated, as best as I can tell, as a letter sent by Billy Fleming to the Miller County Liberal on 13 June 2012, but in the three weeks since it's been shared over 29,000 times and extensively cited with praise by conservative bloggers. I'm not going to link to the sites individually because the appeal of Bill Fleming's logic is obvious: it validates the belief that people who find it difficult to feed themselves during one of the worst economic downturns in American history are no better than wild animals. If poor people are like wild animals, this argument insists, they deserve none of the sympathy reserved for the suffering of human beings, nor do they deserve succor from the taxed income of upstanding citizens like Bill Fleming. So instead of thinking along the lines of the Biblical injunction to be stewards of the planet, upstanding citizens like Bill Fleming conclude that the poor, like wild animals, should learn to fend for themselves. Moreover, they should do so just like wild animals do, under the auspices of the National Parks system, which is funded by the taxed income of upstanding citizens like Bill Fleming. But unless upstanding citizens like Bill Fleming are able to transform their analogical dehumanization of the poor into a legal reality, the poor inhabiting the National Parks will not be wild animals playing parts in the Darwinian daydreams of upstanding citizens like Bill Fleming. They will be displaced citizens with the right to petition the government for temporary housing and access to potable water and edible food. Instead of being minimally dependent on the federal government for meager food subsidies, the displaced poor would be maximally dependent on the federal government for all the necessities of life. Schools would have to be built. Police departments would have to be formed. Sanitation departments would have to be funded. Roads and bridges would have to be improved. The entire infrastructure of modern American society would have to be recreated in what had been the wilds of the National Parks. This means that the tax burden the poor place on upstanding citizens like Bill Fleming would actually increase if upstanding citizens like Bill Fleming had their druthers. The only way to prevent this from occuring would be declare that poor people are not like wild animals, but that they are wild animals. In which case, upstanding citizens like Bill Fleming are simply terrible people who barely merit membership in the...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/07/why-bane-no-why-bain.html"><span><strong>Why Bane? No, why Bain?</strong> By now, you’ve already heard too much about this ridiculous story: Have you heard this new movie, the Batman movie, what is it, The Dark Knight Lights Up or whatever the name is. That’s right, Dark Knight Rises. Lights Up, same thing. Do you know the name of the villain in this movie? Bane. The villain in The Dark Knight Rises is named Bane, B-a-n-e. What is the name of the venture capital firm that Romney ran and around which there’s now this make-believe controversy? Bain. The movie has been in the works for a long time. The release date’s been known, summer 2012 for a long time. Do you think that it is accidental that the name of the really vicious fire breathing four eyed whatever it is villain in this movie is named Bane? To answer the question that’s asked, it’s no coincidence at all, because of this: But that’s beside the point. The real question—the one that no one seems to be asking—is why Bain? I know the real reason is ego cheap and clean, but it boggles the mind that these titans of industry decided that their public face should be the homonym of a word which means, according to my Oxford English Dictionary, 1. A slayer or murderer; one who causes the death or destruction of another. 2. a. That which causes death, or destroys life. b. Poison. Also in comb. in names of of poisonous plants or substances, as in Dogbane, Henbame, Leopard’s Bane, Rat’s Bane, Wolf’s Bane, etc. 3. Murder, death, destruction. 4. That which causes ruin, or is pernicious to well-being: the agent or instrument of ruin or woe, the ‘curse.’ 5. Fatal mischief: woeful or hapless fate. 6. A disease in sheep, the ‘rot.’ Which means that a group of seemingly intelligent people—at least as judged by their inherited wealth—sat around in a board room one day and decided to christen their corporation with a name whose most positive association is “[a] disease in sheep, the ‘rot.’” The fact that any of their failures could be accurately described as having been “the agent or instrument of ruin or woe, the ‘curse’” never seems to have passed their respective minds. It’s the equivalent of opening a company called We Exploit Child Labor for Great Profit, then wondering why no one seems to want to buy your jeans. And yet one of the minds responsible for this feels himself qualified to serve as the Executive Brand of the United States of America? He’ll homonously be the bane of America as much as he and his party literally are.</span></a></div>
