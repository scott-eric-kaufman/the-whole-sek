<p>No contemporary television show employs a quieter camera than <em>Mad Men.</em>&#0160; Its disdain for the <em>Law &amp; Order </em>version of cinematic realism that reached its apogee (or nadir) in <em>Cloverfield </em>is palpable: the camera frames scenes from multiple fixed positions and the shots are spliced together at a pace designed to have a soporific effect on anyone born after 1980.&#0160; The framing and the pacing are a deliberate homage to the films of the period represented on the show.&#0160; Though it may seem natural to direct a series set in the early 1960s in the same mode Douglas Sirk shot films in the 1960s, it is anything but. </p>Most films that aim to be realist depict the past in the dominant contemporary realist mode: <em>Saving Private Ryan </em>looks realistic to us because it panders to what we think looks realistic.&#0160; Had Spielberg directed it in accordance with the realism regnant in 1942 the film would have looked dated.&#0160; I point out the obvious here only to highlight the deliberateness of the decision to shoot <em>Mad Men </em>like a Sirk film (from the staid framing to the odd lighting and colors so saturated that even the most mundane act acquires the air of a particularly vivid dream).&#0160; <em>Mad Men </em>is a show that depicts the seedy underbelly of the early 1960s in the style used in the early 1960s to hide its seedy underbelly.&#0160; (It&#39;s not for nothing that it took two decades for critics to get that Sirk was being ironic.)&#0160; The effect is unsettling: the visuals create the expectation that none of the unseemly stuff will appear on screen and then it does.&#0160;

<p>Here is Peter petulantly declaring his intention not to attend the wedding in a <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48043">medium long shot</a>.&#0160; The lighting is <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/mise-en-scene.htm#140452">three-point</a> but naturalistic: the large window behind him picks him out of the background, but the fill light to his left results in deep shadows on his face because a dim black-and-white television set is functioning as the key light.&#0160; Given that the fill light is supposed to diminish the shadows created by the key light, the fact that it is responsible for the shadows here is unsettling.&#0160; Convention dictates that medium long shots of attractive men sitting on couches shouldn&#39;t contain such shadows: that this one does makes Peter seem shifty because the manner in which he is shot reflects poorly on his character.&#0160; Or seems to.&#0160; It also calls attention to the unusual light source to the right of the screen.&#0160; The scene then cuts directly to a <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48047">medium close-up</a> of Peter and Trudy:</p>

<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01287702ddf1970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-2010-01-21-16h49m39s211" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01287702ddf1970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01287702ddf1970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a></p>

<p>Because there is no pan, the scene moves from one framed shot to another.&#0160; The cumulative effect of all these framed shots is to make the scene seem staged and Peter and Trudy mere actors reciting lines.&#0160; The camera is complicit in making them appear to be playing roles even though that is precisely what they&#39;re refusing to do in this scene.&#0160; The focus in this shot is deliberately deceptive: it appears <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#38599">shallow</a> in order to create the impression that they are close together and suggest all that mutually invaded private space suggests.&#0160; But cut to the next shot:</p>

<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a7ffd49d970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-2010-01-21-16h49m54s109" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a7ffd49d970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a7ffd49d970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a> <br />The next shot frames Peter all by his lonesome.&#0160; Because of all that it implies about gender hierarchies, it is of note that the camera directly faces Peter when it frames him but shoots her from an angle.&#0160; But I digress: the camerawork here is pushing this couple apart by the simple act of framing them individually.&#0160; They won&#39;t reach a consensus because they&#39;re not really together.&#0160; How far apart are they?&#0160; </p>
