Everyone knows that if Pinter had written poetry and no plays, he would be a complete unknown and would not be winning a Nobel.  But briefly skimming the Kos thread, I didn&#39;t see defenses of the quality of Pinter&#39;s poetry.  What I saw was the exact same kind of thing that you wrote: mockery of conservatives using many of the same tropes that Mencken pioneered.  You didn&#39;t write that Pinter didn&#39;t deserve the Nobel, so what were they supposed to take issue with?</p></span>

<p>I can hear the applause but I can&#39;t see any faces.  In short, I suppose what I wrote in there&#39;s a bit crafty, but I thought the shots I took at Pinter hit their mark.  In other words, the update&#39;s about my own failure to communicate the complexities of the position I espoused.  As someone who teaches three days a week...that&#39;s disturbing.  I ought to be able to replicate on my blog what I produce in the classroom, no?  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-10336472-content"><p>His plays are worthy of the award, but I can&#39;t help (hence the McLemee cite) but think this selection was less about his stellar work in decades past and more about his recent renunciation of &quot;the arts.&quot;  I think what we&#39;ve witnessed a literary award based on conveniently political retrodiction; had Pinter been wrong about the war (<i>i.e.</i> if we lived in a world in which our leaders didn&#39;t lie before they thought to speak) I don&#39;t think he would&#39;ve been awarded the Nobel.  In short, I&#39;m not attacking the committee for choosing a worthy candidate, I&#39;m attacking what I believe are their motivations for choosing this worthy candidate over other, equally worthy ones.  For example, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#39;o deserves it as much as Pinter, but he&#39;s not a convenient candidate...no greater statement can be made through his selection.  That&#39;s no knock on Pinter&#39;s work, mind you, and I realize as I write this that I&#39;m falling into some fairly familiar traps, foremost among them the assumption that everything everyone else in the world does constitutes a political statement aimed at the US; but I still think that Pinter&#39;s selection&#39;s more suspect than many of the people who&#39;re clicking from Kos assume, and that&#39;s what compelled me to update this post thus.  (And you&#39;re right: people from Kos shouldn&#39;t care about this positive press, no matter how the ideological opposition spins it; but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t help refine the delicate gradations of aesthetic distinction employed here, does it?)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-10340212-content"><p>If the Nobel Prize in literature is about political commentary, Ngugi wa Th&#39;iongo does deserve a Nobel more than Pinter.  Ngugi makes me shiver, and his writing has occurred under such repressive conditions that the fact he managed to write all, and so eloquently and powerful, is just extraordinary.  I&#39;ve heard Ngugi speak twice, once in the late 80s and once in the mid-90s.</p>

<p>Although I&#39;ve got one of those useless doctorates in English lit and don&#39;t dislike Pinter, he&#39;s someone I didn&#39;t think much about when I went to grad school (even though I did 20th century British and postcolonial lit).  As an undergraduate, I thought his work was clever--read him in the context of Beckett, the Angry Young Men of the 1950s, and also folks like Tom Stoppard--and brutal, but I can&#39;t recall anything after Betrayal that caught my eye and gave me pause.</p>

<p>That said, since it&#39;s been 20+ years since I&#39;ve read The Dumbwaiter, The Caretaker, The Homecoming, etc., perhaps I ought to revisit Pinter with more jaded eyes.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-10340933-content"><p>Scott, you write about his plays being worthy and stellar and so on.  I&#39;m a bit confused at this point.  I realize that you may an anomoly, but isn&#39;t evaluative criticism supposed to be defunct?  I thought that no one was still supposed to be able to make statements that said that one work was great and another was not.  Yet strangely, whenever Nobel time rolls around I don&#39;t see literary studies people complaining about this.  I guess I&#39;ll file this along with the mystery of how those who believe in the lack of privilege of authorial interpretation always seem to forget this when one of their favorites or their own writing is &quot;misinterpreted&quot;.</p>

<p>Basically, I think that contemporary literary studies is so far away from considering issues of quality that I don&#39;t see any grounds for complaint that the Nobel choosing process is political.  How could it not be?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-10349994-content"><p>What&#39;s striking about Pinter winning the prize is that yes, his recent political writings probably affected the choice, but at the same time he&#39;s a very typical pick.  I.e., Nobel Prizes typically (although there have been notable exceptions) go to writers&#39; whose best work is behind them, but who have done something recently to make them newsworthy again.  It&#39;s meant to be a capstone to a career, which seems appropriate in Pinter&#39;s case given that he&#39;s in his mid-70s and has cancer.  Think of Hemingway - he received the award in the mid-1950s, right?  All of his best work was done in the 1920s and 1930s; by the 1950s he was writing crap like The Old Man and the Sea - bleh!  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-10350006-content"><p>Simone,</p>

<p>My choice of Ngũgĩ&#39;s homerism on my part, since he runs UCI&#39;s International Center for Writing and Translation; I hadn&#39;t read him before my wife took his translation seminar in Winter &#39;04.  I know he&#39;s been &quot;short-listed&quot; for the Nobel (it&#39;s standard introductory fare whenever he speaks), but before I read his work I too thought he would&#39;ve been a purely political selection...but he writes mighty powerful stuff, informed by his politics, certainly, but by no means of the &quot;quality&quot; of late Pinter.</p>

<p>Rich,</p>

<p>You can see where I&#39;m headed with the above: yes, I certainly think there&#39;s an evaluative critic in every literary scholar; I just don&#39;t think you can mistake your own interests for what you find interesting.  For example, the evaluative critic in me is very (and increasingly) lukewarm about Jack London, but I find his work interesting for the greater intellectual problems I&#39;m tackling, so I&#39;m writing about him.  There&#39;s also the idea that he&#39;s an important figure, literary evaluations be damned.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m unusual in this respect, as everyone I know separates the work they do from what they enjoy; sure, sometimes those overlap (although when they do, the &quot;enjoyment&quot; becomes increasingly beholden to the &quot;work&quot;), but generally speaking, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unusual to find medievalists reading Pynchon or Americanists reading George Eliot.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-10351123-content"><p>Scott, I think I understand where you&#39;re headed, but isn&#39;t a major part of current literary studies the idea that if &quot;there&#39;s an evaluative critic in every literary scholar&quot;, that this is a false conciousness?  I thought that was what all of those old-style culture wars about canon formation were about; that nothing is really objectively &quot;better&quot; than anything else, that _Ulysses_ and any issue of Superman had the same literary value.  Sure, some texts are more historically important than others, but that&#39;s just the remains of old politics.  So why not use current politics to pick the Nobelist?  If you look at e.g. Matt&#39;s blog, that&#39;s certainly the approach he uses: what he says about Pinter is not how good or bad his work is, or indeed anything about his work, but &quot;A great big wooden beam, stuck in the eye of the liberals&quot;.</p>

<p>I thought that everyone pretty much assumed that the Nobel picks were political.  That&#39;s why Scott McLemee can declare that &quot;This award makes sense only as a foreign-policy editorial disguised as a literary prize&quot; without saying anything about how good a playwright Pinter is and have everyone nod.  That&#39;s why the mockery of the wingnuts focussed on their lack of literary coolness, interest, and technique, rather than on the fact that they thought that the award was political; you also think it was political.</p>

<p>So let me turn the question around a little.  How would you defend your contention that Pinter&#39;s poetry isn&#39;t very good?   Most evaluative judgements seem to basically be an appeal to authority; i.e. when I said that Gene Wolfe was second-rate and gave my reasons, Jonathan wrote &quot;And averse personal reactions to a book are fine and interesting to hear about, don&#39;t get me wrong. It&#39;s just when you make value-judgements based upon them that it becomes difficult&quot;, but he didn&#39;t hesitate to list a number of well-known critics who thought that Gene Wolfe was great as his only evidence that he was great.</p></span>

I can't remember the last time I read a literary novel by a living writer or attended a play by a living playwright.&quot; Others remains unconcerned about this sudden upswell of interest in matters literary: in the immortal words of &quot;GoatGuy&quot;—or as he's known in his native Mexico, el chupacabra—no matter how many Nobels some people places on their mantles, &quot;we are protected from runaway liberalism by the very real revolution in interpersonal and distributed communications, just such as this BLOG.&quot; Some, however, still care enough about poetry to examine the work they condemn. As Pinter's &quot;American Football&quot; memes arounds certain comment sections, &quot;Carolyn&quot; declares it unworthy of a Nobel because her &quot;son could have done that when he was 10 years old and I would have washed his mouth out with soap.&quot; Only a true poetic soul like Carolyn could birth a son so gifted in the poetic arts that, at the tender age of ten, he was capable of penning these immortal lines: We blew the shit right back up their own ass And out their fucking ears. Pinter's award inspires a poetic response from the well-known poet Mark Coffey of Decision '08: A fool, yes… A jackass I am called Yet awards, I win them And nothing’s left but this stale bowl of Fruit Loops Pain Money Dreams Chomsky! My destiny awaits. (Just think: Mark Coffey will never get those three hours back.) Such sweet prosody I expected from Carolyn's foul-mouthed poetic prodigy, but from Mark Coffey? How can so many so patently blessed remain so anonymous? How many mute inglorious Mark Coffeys must we bury before acknowledging the provinciate artistry of Nobel winners? When will the poetry of the 21st Century manifest itself in full? When will the drama of the 21st Century fly off the shelves at the speed of Dan Brown?</span></a></div>

Don't blame me. Blame Kos.] This installment of the History Carnival opens with Laura James' brilliant post on the &quot;The Lost Art of Writing True Crime Headlines.&quot; I would quote selections from it, but her post is cut of a single cloth and should be read as such. Or maybe I'm upset with Laura. Maybe I just don't want to quote from her post. Maybe I hold a grudge against her for having to spend the past week sleeping on the couch. &quot;HEADLESS BODY FOUND IN TOPLESS BAR&quot;? It could have been anybody. Where's Hugh Dod when you need him? (Sharon mumbles something) Dead three hundred years now? Really? (more mumblings) Right then. On with the Carnival! Jamie reports on rampant postwar British randiness. Said BBC Magazine commenter Darren: &quot;My nan reguarly gets tipsy at christmas and proceeds to inform the entire family about all the American soldiers she 'had' during the war.&quot; On an entirely unrelated note, Natalie Bennett unearths a wartime article from Good Housekeeping urging &quot;All Thinking Women&quot; to make &quot;home life so warm and full and rich that husbands, sons, daughters, wherever they may be, even if miles away, will feel its call stronger and more compelling than any temptation.&quot; Why? &quot;The toll of V.D. must be arrested, and it is we wives and mothers who can do much to help.&quot; If all else fails, there's always the desert: John McKay examines the contours of T.E. Lawrence' s recently discovered vision for the Middle East and wonders how the border disputes of the 21st Century would have looked through Lawrence's eyes. Sepoy recounts the journey through the desert to Lawrence (and his eyes') immediate left in a post about Hassanein Pasha and Rosita Forbes' travels through the Sahara. I recommend this entry despite Sepoy's reluctance to dish how long grazing camels can go without water. Thanks to PK, however, those long weeks of studying German will finally pay dividends. Copy of George the Farmer's (nee Georgicus Agricola nee George Bauer) De Re Metallica in hand, I'm likely to take my place among the greatest medieval metallurgists of all time any day now. I may not know how more kilometers I can get beforing refreshing my camel, but at least I'll be able to enrich a mean ore. But what will I do with it? How about some old-fashioned imperial expansion? K.M. Lawson demonstrates the importance of working from multiple sources by means of an extended dialogue between various histories about the Japanese annexation of Korea. That the Japanese annexed a country in possession of a perfect alphabet (according to Language Log) is quite the technological achievement. There may not seem to be any hard and fast connection between military prowess and an alphabet with no subphonemic distinctions, but that's only because there aren't any. Or are there? No, there really aren't. But that...</span></a></div>
