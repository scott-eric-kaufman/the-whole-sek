Then he'll put 'em in the box. After a few moments of professional grilling, they'll break down. If only. In the real world, I'm thankful that Mike expressed real sympathy for my plight. How do I know he did? Because he gave me a bottle of my favorite vodka gratis and a lift home. See what I mean? Sometimes the world isn't a cruel place.

		<span id="comment-18013333-content"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>I thought I&#39;d drop by, because after I re-read your original post over at the Valve, I came to the conclusion that you may have misunderstood something.  It sounds like you think this sick mess was a debate about literary intentionalism.</p>

<p>This whole nonsense started when Thers put up a post about JG missing a Conrad quote on another blog.  It was a unserious post on a blog with a small, friendly readership.  (ie - Many pictures on his blog were of his children and about their activities. Many of his posters are also personal friends.)</p>

<p>Anyways, in the last paragraph, in a offhand manner, Thers  jokingly referred to JG&#39;s &quot;class notes&quot;, and said he would decipher them for our amusement if he got drunk this summer.  </p>

<p>Surprisingly, JG read this blog post (several days after it was put up) and said that Thers should analyze his class notes immediately as his reputation had been impugned.</p>

<p>So Thers demurs, saying he has three children (an infant) and a lot of stuff to do.  A bunch of his commenters come over to Metacomments and pester him to Duel!  Duel! with their leader.  Immediately!  Don&#39;t wait! Now! Now!  </p>

<p>I feel quite guilty because I went over to PW and engaged with the commenters. (The first of many idiotic mistakes on my part.  As you can see, they think I am a very, very bad mollusk.  And I certainly did not act with courtesy or take him seriously.  Not because I have any thoughts or even any investment into the reputation of various literary theories, but because his commenters were rude and I was not interested in JG&#39;s literary analysis.  Yes, I am quite immature.) </p>

<p>Thers began to reluctantly engage.  But, you seem to think that this &quot;engagement&quot; was some sort of debate about intentionalism.  It most definitely was not.  </p>

<p>This debate was about JG&#39;s class notes.  It was not some sort of attack on intentionalism or Michaels.  (In fact, JG calls his own approach &quot;radical intentionalism.&quot;  I have no idea what that is - if you&#39;re interested you&#39;ll have to ask him.) </p>

<p>Thers, in fact, comes at his work from a historical perspective.   We discussed the irony of our conservatism many times on Metacomments &amp; Eschaton - that Jeff wanted to argue with a deconstructionist yet he was stuck with talking to us.  </p>

<p>(For about a day things started to get interesting.  I regreted my previous rude behavior.  I had some good exchanges with a commenter who is writing his dissertation in a Classics department.  That was fun.  Then the insults started again and stuff went downhill.  If for some strange reason you are interested, you can read these discussions over at PW.)</p>

<p>Eventually a statement about the two year old was made at Metacomments by an anonymous commenter and at that point the &quot;debate&quot; jumped the shark.  </p>

<p>This weekend an anonymous commenter researched and revealed on PW the personal information about Thers and his wife (who had never commented at PW).  This person even revealed the car that they drive.  Thers e-mailed him and asked him to remove the information. At first JG deleted this information, but he was angry at commenters on PW who commented about the previous ugly comment.  He was also mad that Thers was not grateful enough to him for removing the information.  JG got mad and reposted the private information about Thers and his wife.  <br />
-----------</p>

<p>This is probably way more information then you wanted to know.  For what it&#39;s worth - that&#39;s what I saw.  It sounds like you are utterly uninterested in the sick spectacle that went down.  I would say that&#39;s a great instinct, and shows that your maturity is much greater then my own.  </p>

<p><br />
Anyways, I never thought it was a serious debate about literary theory (New Left/Old Left/ Historicism/whatever).  It was always about JG&#39;s notes.  I didn&#39;t want you to get the impression it was a attack on Ben Michael or literary intentionalism.  </p>

<p><br />
Please delete this comment if you think it would be disruptive to the debate that you are starting over at the Valve.  It looks like that debate will be serious and productive.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-18035229-content"><p>Judging from the preceeding comments, I expect a beatdown, but oh well. I find that the whole thing started over the class notes, too, and various and sundry insults from metacomments and others (as our host noted on The Valve) which were, of course, responded to in kind by the commentariat at PW. Including yours truly. That&#39;s how most flame wars start. Nothing new there. </p>

<p>Sadly, the P-word comment was made by someone posting on metacomments (and now we may never know by whom, it having been taken down and all). And personal items were posted on PW about Thersites (spelling may vary, I&#39;m having generic trouble with that name). I must say as a long time commenter at PW, that I did not recognize the handle of the person who outed him. </p>

<p>I did find it funny that posts were made demanding the removal of the personal information starting in the wee hours. For some reason the PW server is set to Eastern time, Colorado is Mountain time, so any posts requesting information removal prior to 11 AM (9 AM Mountain) would be fruitless. But enough folks could not figure that out and escalated the problem further. And the obligatory post of hoping Jeff died of cancer was made at PW as well. How sweet. Not. Trolls will be trolls. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not in academia. If this small subset of academia is representative of the politcal culture therein, I likely would not fit. I&#39;m in mainframe computer programming, and I will, as far as I can see, retire in that line of work. Engineers (and computer science was in engineering at that time--yes, I&#39;m getting to be an old fart) generally count on intentionalism in pretty much everything that they do, but they don&#39;t know what to call it. That is the general tone of all of the technical tomes that we tend to read. This is reinforced in computer science by the programming languages taking the same things the same way all of the time. </p>

<p>Bash Jeff all you guys want, but I probably would not be the least bit interested in the topic, except superficially, had I not been reading over there. </p>

<p>Scott, feel free to flush this if you so desire. </p></span>

<p>It’s almost as if they are daring me to say fuck it, and just let the info fly!</p>

<p>Thersites should be alerted of this at once.  Because his little attack dogs are starting to take up too much of my time.  And I have better things to do, like, I dunno, teach a couple of ad hoc comp classes at Front Range Community College, if the mood strikes.<br />
Posted by Jeff Goldstein | permalink<br />
on  05/30  at  02:23 PM</i></p>

<p>The above comment appeared on Protein Wisdom shortly before Jeff Goldstein reposted the personal information on Thers and his wife.  </p>

<p>Thersites and his wife had previously remained anonymous on the web.  However, shortly thereafter Jeff Goldstein posted the real name of Thers, his wife (who was not involved in this argument), where they live, and where they work was re-posted by Jeff Goldstein on the web.</p>

<p><br />
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s no surprise to anybody that Thers removed his blog from the web. </p>

<p><br />
I would really appreciate it, and be really thankful, if Jeff Goldstein would remove all personal information about Thersites and his family from his website.  </p>

<p>Thank you.  </p></span>

So I feel, how do I say it, <i>lazy, lazy, lazy</i>.  Too bad I&#39;m not more dependent on online sources, or I&#39;d be able to whip through this chapter during my convalescence.  Instead, I&#39;m stuck being unable to work and exploring my inner Benn Michaels.  (By which I mean, trying to find structurally interesting connections between distinct bodies of thought.  The irony here being that it&#39;s Michaelsian thought I&#39;m doing this to.)</p>

<p>Geoduck2, check your email.</p>

<p>(Oh, and Noth over D&#39;Onofrio?  I don&#39;t think so.  I&#39;d rather the genius with the tilted head than the noble, blue-collar guy who works on intuition and, um, stupidity.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love Noth.  I even postponed my post-high-school graduation festivities to see his &quot;last&quot; episode on the original L &amp; O, but he&#39;s no D&#39;Onofrio.)</p></span>

It’s been a good, long weekend and I have nothing for the intro. Powered by a 1994 Glenrothes Vintage, on to the injuries: Kerry Wood struck out everyone—including the peanut vendor and the visiting radio announcer—when he was in Peoria. &quot;Unhittable,&quot; one scout told me. That same scout saw Mark Prior pitch on Monday night and struggled to find words. He sighed and groaned before finally saying something I can’t print here. &quot;There was nothing right with him. No velocity (a max of 90). No command. No movement. No missed bats. No consistency—his stride was never the same and his arm was slow. If he wasn’t Mark Prior, I’d say he was at the right level. I have no idea what happened to him.&quot; Prior only went two innings before hitting his pitch count and now we’ll have to wait to see how he recovers. Not only did he show only a bit more velocity, but the absent control might be even more worrisome. Prior will have one more rehab start at Peoria, but at this stage, it might be time to think about slowing this down. One observer reminded me of another pitcher who lost it—Roy Halladay. It will be interesting to see if the Cubs can be as forward-looking as the Blue Jays once were. Looks like Acephalous got lucky. Scott Eric Kaufman's injuries are severe but not career-threatening, and he could be back in six weeks. Other bloggers have recovered from serious injuries more quickly, but no one will mistake Kaufman for a quick healer. One doctor I spoke to compared his injuries to those a football player might suffer if they had Kaufman's frame and were tackled by a 790 lbs. linebacker. &quot;We see the same injuries, albeit not quite so severe, in young running backs who don't know how to take a tackle properly.&quot; Kaufman's been diagnosed with a hip pointer (a deep bone bruise of the pelvis caused by compressive forces), a left oblique strain (a tearing of the of the internal oblique muscles from the undersurface of his lower ribs), and a lower lumbar sprain (a detaching of ligaments in the lower back). He will return to the UCI Medical Center next week for another MRI and his first session with the physical trainer. Although rest is the only real cure for these types of injuries, I think Kaufman may be back sooner than anyone expects. UCI's doctors live on the bleeding edge of modern medicine. &quot;They told me to sit on a ball,&quot; Kaufman told me. The big blow for the Phillies on Monday wasn’t another Ryan Howard bomb, it was losing Jon Lieber to the DL. Lieber pulled up covering first—and yes, there has been a major uptick in this type of injury this season—and left an inning later. The groin strain isn’t serious, but it's certainly enough to necessitate the DL move. With a history of elbow and back problems, the...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/im_not_up_to_pr.html"><span><strong>The Idiot's Guide to Scott's Idiosyncratic Theoretical Orientation (Sadly, Not Complete With Cartoons)</strong> I'm not up to producing original content tonight. Fortunately, Forgotten Boy and N. Pepperell are having an incredibly stimulating conversation down in the comments to this post. Were I able to put two and two together tonight I'd jump in. (Forgotten Boy continues to write circles around the competition. I wish I'd wished to be hit by a car to write like him before. I'd wish it now, but it'd be in poor taste. Don't want to be offending myself after all.) Also, a number of people have professed a desire to understand my particular theoretical orientation. Here are some links to posts in which its contours are visible: My long meditation on theoretical eclecticism. It's my contribution to the Theory's Empire event and discusses why I value a confrontational mode of literary scholarship. Another long post, this time about New Historicists' love of homologies and my problem with them. A veritable sonnet concerning my devotion to historical accuracy over and above all commitments theoretical. Speaking of which: my feelings about uncritical theoretical commitments. (Be sure to read the comments.) A bit about my tortured relatonship with Foucault. (The second bit of which is, as Matt'll tell you, still pending.) My intellectual history. The funnier version of my intellectual history. The New Historicist reading list I put together earlier this year. The text of my public lecture about historicisms old and new. All of these pieces are flawed and incomplete, but as I've never written a comprehensive account of my critical position, they'll have to suffice for the moment. Needless to say, I've changed my mind about some of that since I wrote it, but it'll provide those who seek to understand my position better a sound starting point. P.S. Some of you have websites whose banner and layout bore me to sleep before I have a chance read a word you say. Luckily for you I have a solution: Lauren's &quot;willing 2 work 4 fud.&quot; You can find some examples of her work on Feministe as well as the sites she links to in that post. Like Dr. B's. How can you not love that banner? It's classic. Yours can be too. Were I not married to a graphic designer, dirt poor and on the path that terminates in Dickensian gutters, I'd hire her myself.</span></a></div>
