Dan Riehl twits along the lines of this tonight: Someone, it seems, neglected to tell him that the default insult for the likes of those along the lines of Acephalous is to say that he are &quot;headless&quot; and thus &quot;dumbly.&quot; But, however, instead of if going for the quasi-intelligent pro forma insult, Riehl pulled on a full-homophobe . . . which is, of course, the very thing I went after him in the first place for the line of which for that would be, you know. Please everyone congratulate him into it!</span></a></div>

(This, however, does.)</strong> For purely academic reasons, I’ve never understood the argument that we should ignore Rush Limbaugh because he’s simply an entertainer who says outrageous things that millions of people are merely entertained by. I didn’t read the complete works of Silas Weir Mitchell because they were good—they are almost uniformly awful—I read them because they were popular. I was interested not in the content of his thought—it is almost uniformly mediocre—but in why his contemporaries found it so wildly appealing. If you want to learn which ideas and ideologies literate Americans in 1900 found comforting, you do not consult Henry James: you turn to the inartistic novels that parroted their prejudices back to them in a language they already understood. So when people say that we should dismiss Limbaugh on the grounds that he only says outrageous things to sell his product, I’m never quite sure why they’re more concerned with Limbaugh’s motivations than the fact that millions of Americans are buying what he’s selling. Ignoring whatever millions of Americans are buying distorts your understanding of the American political scene whether it be 2009 or 1909. If you work on popular culture in 1909, you are limited to tracking the flight of a given idea—but if you track a given idea in 2009, your work can actually change its trajectory. You might not know exactly where exactly that idea will land yet, but you can do the political calculus required to figure out where it came from and where it’s likely to strike. If it feels like you’re tilting window fans at cannon balls from half a continent away, remember what they say about rare Chinese butterflies flapping their wings: they are less likely to be minuten-pinned by mad lepidopterists—which is beside the point. The point, as one prominent Beatles apologist recently argued, is that cultural studies can be an important fan so long as we aim it at the right cannonball. In this case, the important issue is not that Limbaugh is a racist who makes racist statements, but that those statements resonate with his audience so powerfully. Consider, for example, that he feels no compulsion to qualify his sarcastic call for segregated busing: RUSH: Well, did he say why, in Obama’s America, that incident with the white kid getting beat up on the black school bus was not racially motivated? CALLER: I didn’t hear him comment about that. No, sir. RUSH: Because we’ve seen the videotape. Have you seen the videotape? CALLER: Sure. RUSH: We can’t hear what’s being said. CALLER: No. RUSH: So we don’t know what obvious taunts this lone white student was dishing out to the whole bus. CALLER: Right. RUSH: We don’t know what obvious taunts. CALLER: Right. RUSH: Worse than the obvious verbal taunts, we all know the racism that was in the kid’s mind. I mean Newsweek magazine says he was born a racist. So you know the white kid is sitting there thinking N-word and all kinds of things being surrounded by...</span></a></div>
