Dr. Clouthier continues: I was at another service-oriented gathering of young women where the girls were in tight bandeau-skirts — you know, the kind of tube-top skirts that hookers wear on street corners.

Moreover, look at the effect it’s having on family-oriented conservatives like McCain: not only is he incapable of diverting his eyes from the buffet of cleavage present at CPAC, he’s incapable of imagining a world in which conservative men possess the wherewithal to do anything other than stare at their compatriots’ breasts. Riehl isn’t some sexist exception—he’s just honest enough to admit that if women flaunt their wares, he’ll gladly gawk at them while pretending to agree with whatever they happen to be saying.

			<p>Somehow I missed the fact that a group of C-List conservative bloggers turned on themselves over the issue of propriety at CPAC. At the same event in which this&#0160;<a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/02/to-the-list-of-items-which-are-always-excellent-ideas">high-minded little event</a>&#0160;took place, it was reported that the female attendees “<a href="http://melissablogs.com/2012/02/14/cpac-the-jersey-shore-ification-of-our-young-people/">looked like two-bit whores</a>.” That’s according to Dr. Melissa Clouthier, who feels the need to remind everyone she’s a doctor, presumably because her elevated diction might convince folks otherwise. Dr. Clouthier continues:</p>

And if some number of them are hotties in tube tops, I’ll find a way to endure&#0160;<em>because I love America just that much</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more “hotties in tube tops,” Riehl argues, the more powerful the right will become, because nothing builds a stronger coalition more quickly than objectifying and diminishing half the people who might want to join it.

<p>And as Robert Stacy McCain—the man most likely to declare himself the winner of a Hunter S. Thompson prose-alike contest—<a href="http://theothermccain.com/2012/02/14/codys-totally-excellent-cpac/">pointed out</a>, this process has already started:</p>

<p>Conservative are already being required to dress like hookers! Moreover, look at the effect it’s having on family-oriented conservatives like McCain: not only is he incapable of diverting his eyes from the buffet of cleavage present at CPAC,&#0160;<em>he’s incapable of imagining a world in which conservative men possess the wherewithal to do anything other than stare at their compatriots’ breasts</em>. Riehl isn’t some sexist exception—he’s just honest enough to admit that if women flaunt their wares, he’ll gladly gawk at them while pretending to agree with whatever they happen to be saying. What are they saying? Who cares? So long as the lungs pushing those words out reside beneath a bosom being amply displayed, Riehl and McCain will keep on nodding.</p>
<p>How can serious conservative women avoid being objectified by the likes of Riehl and McCain? Dr. Melissa Clouthier—who, you’ll note, McCain stripped of her degree in the same manner he’s stripped her of her dignity—<a href="http://melissablogs.com/2012/02/14/cpac-the-jersey-shore-ification-of-our-young-people/">suggests</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. No cleavage.</strong>&#0160;That’s right. Cover that up. I say “no” in absolutist terms because women will show a tiny bit and that’s okay, but really, in a business environment where ideas are the priority, a dude thinking about your ta-tas is counter-productive.</p>
<p><strong>2. Skirts no more than three finger-widths above the knee.</strong>Why do I even have to write this? Well, because someone is allowing these girls out of the house with mini-skirts that reveal too much.</p>
<p><strong>3. Save the stilettos</strong>&#0160;for Saturday night on a date with your boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>4. Bend at the knee.</strong>&#0160;No, I don’t want to see your butt.&#0160;Young women, you degrade your own value by dressing and then acting the ho.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Young conservative women, stop “acting the ho”! You know your ideological brethren respond to such displays, so the heavy burden of preventing them from treating you like a “hooker … on the street” falls on your shoulder pads. The alternative is having to deal with McCain<a href="http://theothermccain.com/2012/02/16/who-wants-to-see-tina-korbes-thighs/">reducing you to the “<em>haawwtt</em>&#0160;fianceé”</a>&#0160;of one of the aforementioned conservative “rappers” in a post about a conservative blogger showing too much leg while interviewing Rick Santorum. This conservative blogger, Tina Korbe, had the nerve to score a job McCain wanted, but instead of congratulating her, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They’re gonna hire a chick. Somebody with the ‘face for Fox,’ a candidate for the&#0160;<em>Red Eye</em>&#0160;leg-chair&#0160;they can use to ‘brand’ the blog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I appreciate the admission that Fox exclusively hires women whose legs appeal to the likes of Riehl and McCain, I think we &#0160;can also see the problem with the sartorial tenor of discussions on the right:&#0160;<em>women are reducible to their bodies.</em>Anything they do to remind conservative men of this fact will cause them either to imagine making babies with them or to fret about what’s happening to the unwanted babies lust like theirs made. Women aren’t independent entities possessing wit and intelligence unless they divorce themselves from the only thing that makes them valuable to conservative men in the first place: their bodies.</p>
<p>Which don’t exist or matter, unless parts of them are visible, in which case only those parts exist and they matter very, very much.</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e7e812ec970c-content"><p>I think your argument is a little strained.  The conservative critics strike me as consistent on this issue.  Their argument is:  if we&#39;re going to advocate family values, self-restraint, and sex supported by love and marriage, then it&#39;s a bad thing for the CPAC convention to get a rep as a hotbed of drunken hook-ups.  True, Melissa Clouthier&#39;s focus on the women hints at a double standard, but I&#39;ve also read assaults on the men&#39;s caddish behavior at this event.     </p>

<p>If the conservatives are hypocritical, it&#39;s just in the usual way with respect to the larger political and economic picture.  They tend to support big business and tax breaks for corporations, when it&#39;s that very corporate culture (&quot;sex sells&quot;) that is destroying traditional morality and the family.</p>

<p>At the risk of being overly schematic, the right and left seem mirror images in their incoherence with respect to sexual liberation.  The right wants to focus on personal responsibility, while disavowing the larger economic trends that are fostering the new immorality.  The left wants free self-expression, but is then horrified by the way such self-expression is so easily branded and marketed (as it inevitably will be).  </p>

<p>With all due respect, your post reproduces the left&#39;s confusion on this issue regarding the specific topic of fashion.  If a woman wears denim hot pants or a brief Abercrombie top, she&#39;s going to get a reaction from men.  Accusing men of sexism for checking her out strikes me as a rather convoluted line of reasoning.  If she wants to be viewed primarily in terms of her wit and intelligence, then maybe best not to wear super-provocative clothes.  </p></span>

But he shouldn’t be celebrated for writing what he wrote: [W]e all must deplore that [Pat] Buchanan was booted from MSNBC, and recognize why it happened now. Must we? Buchanan begins the book with a lament that “[b]y 2020, deaths among white Americans will exceed births, while mass immigration is altering forever the face of America” (2). He later opens a chapter entitled “The End of White America” with an analysis of Tom Buchanan—no blood relation, just the ideological one—discussing the novel’s fictional version of Lothrop Stoddard’s The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy. “Well, it’s a fine book and everybody ought to read it. The idea is that if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.” (123) Instead of dismissing his namesake’s approval of unscientific racism, Buchanan hems and haws about Margaret Sanger and eugenics as a liberal science and Stoddard being an Ivy League-educated racist who predicted Japan’s rise to power, its war with the United States, a second European war, the fall of the Western empires, mass migration of peoples of color to the West, and the rise of Islam as a threat to Western civilization. (124) He can’t decide whether to condemn Stoddard for being a typical academic liberal or praise him for being a prophet. So does neither. Or possibly both. What Tom Buchanan and [Stoddard] feared [some clearly non-white academic writing in the Atlantic named] Professor Hsu welcomes: “The End of White America is a cultural and demographic inevitability.” (124) Both Tom and Pat Buchanan align themselves with Stoddard and against Hsu, which is odd considering that Stoddard and Hsu are making essentially the same argument: white America is on the decline. The only difference between any of them is that the Buchanan boys share Stoddard’s “unashamedly racialist” assumption that the death of white America should be mourned. Did Buchanan forget he condemned Stoddard for being a racist when he joined him in mourning? Or does he simply not care about the contradiction? It’s genuinely difficult to tell. He’ll acknowledge that The Tea Party and town hall protests of 2009 were almost wholly white affairs. (126) But its impossible to parse that sentence. Is the attempt by white people to organize white affairs to defeat racial and cultural assaults on white America a good thing? Given his assessment of Stoddard, the answer would seem to be clear. But a few pages later he’ll be complaining about the very fact he just he conceded: CNN, NPR, and USA Today all zeroes in on the racial composition of the crowd [at Glenn Beck's &quot;Restoring Honor&quot; rally] as “predominantly,” “overwhelmingly,” or “almost all white.” The media’s unsubtle message: the Tea Party is a protest movement of, by, and for white people. (131) You know who would agree with that assessment? The Pat Buchanan who...</span></a></div>
