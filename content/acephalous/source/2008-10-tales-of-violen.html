Violence Last night at approximately 3 a.m., I'd swathed my head with these puppies and was about fifteen seconds into this clip: When three sleeping cats simultaneously popcorned three feet straight up then stared at the door. I doffed my headphones and ran to the door to stop the mad rapist or sullen murder who'd attempted to break it down and scared my cats. I put my eye to the peephole and saw a woman across the way sprawled out on the walkway. Tears streamed down her face. Between my peephole and her door stood a man of no small stature. He loomed over her. She mumbled language while he glowered. I stood behind my door voyeuring. Didn't know what to do. So I ran—in the way people with crippling chest congestion run, i.e. hilariously—back to the bedroom and woke the wife. We dashed back to the front door and peered through our peephole but they were gone. At least she was. I could feel him pacing on the landing between the first and second floors. I'm not sure what happened. She could've been drunk and he could've been on the side of angels. That seems the likeliest scenario, given that there was no yelling after she hit the floor. (I don't know from before, what with the headphones and all.) I thought about going over there today and saying something about if they needed to move things at 3 a.m. I'm usually up and am more than happy to orchestrate other people lifting heavy objects. Then I thought better of it. I'm really not sure what to do and/or what I should've done. II. Heat Cats can't taste heat. Nor does it have any effect on their digestion. How do I know? Last night this little man ran off with some buffalo wings drenched in sriracha. He neither mewled like a cat in pain nor had any other issues later. From this I surmise cats' tongues can't tell from Scoville. Lard their food with capsaicin and they'll not mind a wit so long as there's lard in there. (Or so I hope. I don't want to clean that up. Would you?)" />

<p>Last night at approximately 3 a.m., I'd swathed my head with <a href="http://www.sennheiserusa.com/newsite/productdetail.asp?transid=004974">these puppies</a> and was about fifteen seconds into this clip:</p>

<p>Cats probably don&#39;t eat peppers in the wild, which might explain it if they aren&#39;t affected.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-135437723-content"><p>I don&#39;t think that there really is an English equivalent, thankfully.  I could see, perhaps, somebody English dating a German woman and his parents telling him &quot;if you marry her, then Hitler wins&quot;, but the total effect would be a lot more risible.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I remember when one of my elder brothers went on a hike through Europe (during college, I think).  He apparently dated a German woman for a while during his trip, or something, because we got a phone call at our house for him from her.  I remember her weeping over the phone to me about how sorry she was about what people in Germany had done to the Jews.  I mean, sheesh.  I could easily imagine what my brother had gotten out of it, but I was only something like 14 at the time, and I thought I was a little young to be involved in her kink.</p>

<p>Neil Gaiman had a great scene in <i>Sandman</i> that was similar, come to think of it.  Hob Gadling, the immortal, is going on and on to his girlfriend about how guilty the English really are for the slave trade.  She says &quot;this is the first time you&#39;ve dated a black woman, isn&#39;t it&quot; and when he says yes, and how do you know, she says something about how if he had she would already have told him off about it.  Of course, the scene is saved from banality by her not knowing that he&#39;s an immortal who really did get rich off of slavery, and that his guilt is actually personal.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/10/job-search-part.html"><span><strong>Job Search, Part I: Application Standardization</strong> This is a terrible idea. I shouldn't be posting about my job search under my own name. How stupid am I? Not that stupid. But there are some aspects of the job search which—being incapable of offending anyone—can be written about. Take the application process. In order to apply to similar entry-level positions at similar institutions, I must: write a five-page cover letter write a ten-page cover letter write a 250 word abstract write a 1,000 word abstract write a 4 page statement of pedagogical philosophy write a 6 page statement of pedagogical philosophy write a 10 page statement of pedagogical philosophy hack a dissertation chapter into a 15 page writing sample hack a dissertation chapter into a 20 page writing sample hack a dissertation chapter into a 25 page writing sample And these are the plates I'm juggling today. Tomorrow they'll toss a chainsaw at me. Saturday they'll set on fire. On Sunday, me, my plates and a blazing chainsaw will be on a unicycle. Monday will witness my unicycle on a trapeze wire. Come Tuesday, a bear on a bicycle will follow me out on the wire. On Wednesday, they'll hand him a chainsaw. Thursday they'll set his on fire too. By Friday I'll be chopped and charred. Come Saturday I'll be bear scat. Or so it feels. I understand the different needs of different programs demand different applications. I even understand that the ability to fill out a particular application competently is a sign to some hiring committees that you fit the needs of their particular institution. At least in theory. I wonder, though, how many applications are binned because some types of dissertations are more easily condensed or expanded. Because mine fits in this category: I find it quite easy to remove large chunks of ancillary material—digressions which relate more to discussions in other chapters, or whose provenance is limited to scholars working in a particular sub-discipline—or limit the types of digressions based on the sort of job I'm applying to. So, for example, with the London chapter I can remove the large chunks of intellectual history and presented a streamlined literary analysis for Institution X or widen my gyre to include early British or Irish modernist works by reinserting a bit about Shaw and Lamarckism for Institution Y. Not because I'm more qualified (not that I want to go there again), but because I wrote a dissertation which allows me to do so. Meaning I may not be the best candidate for a particular job. (Of course, this implies my dissertation is good and that I'm not merely streamlining crap. I may well be. At some point, I've been told, I'll be able to assess the quality of my dissertation. I've not yet reached that point.)</span></a></div>
