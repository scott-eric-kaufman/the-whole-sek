His daughter will now grow up not having an important person is her life and will not have the guidance a father can provide.  For those of us with children about his age it brings a pause and a prayer and a thought &quot;What if it had been my child&quot;.

As I'm having to borrow the internet cable from someone currently using it to communicate with her students, until I resolve this issue (tomorrow) my online presence will be hit-or-miss. (I'll be doing the hitting thank you very much.) But! I hope to have this all resolved very shortly (tomorrow) and begin posting Very Seriously Intellectual items about funny books. I'm team-teaching a unit on Alan Moore's Watchmen the next two weeks for a course on the rhetoric of heroism. You're to be my test audience.* More shortly (tomorrow). *Awkward phrasing, I know, but far better than what I first wrote: &quot;You'll get the dry runs.&quot; This is what happens when you don't post for five days. All dissertation and no play makes SEK a poor writer.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/01/notes-for-futur.html"><span><strong>Notes for Future Satirists</strong> Satire should be funny. Rechristening something a part of the female anatomy isn't funny unless you're Dane Cook. (&quot;The Vulva&quot;? What is so quintessentially feminine about it that nothing but external female genitalia will suffice? Is it all the words? Are you frightened by their feminine wiles?) Satire should not require the satirist to tell the reader what is and isn't funny. (&quot;This part of the gag wasn't funny&quot;? Do tell.) The object of satire should be discernible without having to use a person's real name. (&quot;How can we be sure people will know who satirizing?&quot; &quot;Don't know dude, maybe we should use his real name?&quot; &quot;Excellent idea! Then everyone will know who we're talking about.&quot;) Satire should be legible. (Font sizes below 2 are strongly discouraged.) The satirist should have a passing familiarity with the object of satire. (&quot;Cuteness Cat Friday is four days off&quot;? Do you want to be the Dane Cook of the English department? Because I have some material on airports, cheese, and those crazy things women do to annoy men that's been killing in the Poconos since 1934.) Satire should be funny.</span></a></div>
