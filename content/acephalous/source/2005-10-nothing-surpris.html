		<span id="comment-10658998-content"><p>Hmm, too many topics in one post.</p>

<p>Books first, I suppose.  This list really shows the problems with evaluative criticism, I think.  The didn&#39;t make a list of &quot;most influential&quot; novels, they wrote &quot;best&quot;.   That means -- to take the genre that I&#39;m most familiar with -- The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe should not be on there; it&#39;s not C.S. Lewis&#39; best book.  Ubik should not be; it&#39;s not PKD&#39;s best book.  </p>

<p>Then there are the choices that look odd because of what else they did or didn&#39;t include.  The Lord of the Rings I would say perhaps should not be on the list, but since they included Deliverance, maybe the competition wasn&#39;t that strong.  Snow Crash, and nothing by Bruce Sterling?  No.  Watchmen should not be on the list because it isn&#39;t a novel; if it were, then Sandman should be on the list.  And no John Crowley, no Peake, no Cabell, no Iain Banks?  I don&#39;t think that this is really a list of best books, it&#39;s a list of a few well-known, influential, &quot;cool&quot; books from each category.</p>

<p>Next, insurance.  You should definitely see a lawyer before accepting bland assurances of denial of coverage because of existing medical conditions.  I&#39;m not one, but there are a patchwork of Federal and state laws affecting who can be denied coverage.  As for Canada, funny you should ask -- I investigated this rather thoroughly recently.  Got family in Canada?  If not, good luck getting permission to immigrate while in remission.  They generally want people within certain skilled occupations, in good health, with money, and not too old.  If you do just crash at someone&#39;s house, I&#39;m not sure if they really will just treat you.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-10660958-content"><p>Rich, I&#39;m certainly with you on the token PKD.  <i>Ubik</i>?  I don&#39;t think so.  I know I don&#39;t like <i>The Man in The High Castle</i> as much as you, but at the very least <i>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldridge</i> or <i>Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said</i> should&#39;ve been the representative PKD.  I can&#39;t, however, agree with you on the count of Sterling.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m a fan, but in terms of quality I&#39;d put Pat Cadigan on instead of Sterling; and <i>The Cryptonomicon</i> instead of <i>Snow Crash</i>.  But yes, I think you&#39;re right to say that they wanted &quot;representative&quot; works instead of great ones.  I meant to make that clear in the post itself, but got carried away by the yelling.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I think you&#39;re right about Canada, but the strange thing is...I&#39;ve been a Canadian citizen before, and I believe (by which I mean &quot;my parents have informed me&quot;) that&#39;s its easier to become Canadian if you&#39;ve already been Canadian.  Sure, I was a toddler...and sure, I lived in the middle of nowhere (Canada, eh?), but still, if they can&#39;t accept one of their own back into the fold, who will they accept?  <i>Terrorists</i>?  I didn&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>Cam, I hate to say it, but on this count you and I disagree.  I&#39;ve read Cormac McCarthy...and he is no Faulkner.  He tries really Really REALLY hard to be the Bard of Oxford (MS), but he&#39;s too masculine and confident.  He&#39;s the writer Faulkner would&#39;ve been had he the confidence necessary to be bold instead of honest (to his experience).  I know I&#39;m in the minority here (which is part of the reason I left it italicized sans explanation), but no matter how many people whose intelligence I respect force me to reconsider the merits of <i>Blood Meridian</i>, I still don&#39;t like it...almost compulsively.  There are very few books I&#39;ve allowed others to convince me of their &quot;greatness&quot; despite my intense dislike for them, but McCarthy&#39;s one of them.  I&#39;ve tried and I&#39;ve tried and I&#39;ve tried...but unlike Raymond Carver, who I&#39;ve grown to love despite my initial knee-jerks, I can&#39;t overcome the faux-Faulkner plus uber-individualism and <i>the violence</i> of McCarthy.  That&#39;s not to say I can&#39;t be convinced otherwise...which is my way of saying that it&#39;s up to you to show me the way (not in a Styx-ish way, er, you know what I mean).</p></span>

<p>That was probably it.</p>

<p>The author of <em>Ratner&#39;s Star</em> and <em>White Noise</em> is not a terrible novelist. I favor some of his work more than others, but to simply call him &quot;terrible&quot; and make an unfortunate and inaccurate comparison to Baudrillard isn&#39;t worthy of Dale Peck. Why do you hold this opinion? Terrible relative to whom?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-10672649-content"><p>What I meant was &quot;Why do you think my criticism of DeLillo extends to <i>all</i> authors?&quot;  Because it doesn&#39;t.  I admit to being flip above, but the person who wrote everything after about page 90 or so of <i>White Noise</i> is, in point of fact, a terrible novelist.  The person who wrote everything after the first section of <i>Underworld</i>?  Also a terrible novelist.  Why do I hold this opinion?  Could it be that every single character in a DeLillo novel who doesn&#39;t speak in DeLillo&#39;s narrative voice sounds like a caricature?  Could it be that I find the persona behind that voice a little obsessed with its sense of its own profundity?  (Think <i>American Beauty</i> and the plastic-bag-<i>is-art</i> scene.)  And I don&#39;t think the comparison to Baudrillard inaccurate in the least: both have a deep desire to be thought profound, and both think their audience will mistake sloppy faux-profound statements for profundity; both have been told, for far too long, that their work <i>is</i> profound, and so both have become even sloppier as the years march on.  <i>Underworld</i> anyone?  Both also claim to describe the postmodern condition, and their work is often paired by scholars seeking to do the same.  I&#39;m sorry, Jonathan, but if you can&#39;t see how DeLillo and Baudrillard&#39;s work dovetails, this conversation isn&#39;t really worth having.  </p></span>

The latter has more rhetorical constraints. Though I agree with you to a certain extent about Baudrillard, I think that &quot;obsessed with its own sense of its own profundity&quot; is just an irritated reaction on your part--not by any means a feature of the text itself. Reading the same book, I see an absurdist--even nihlistic--exploration of the limits of intellectuals and &quot;profundity.&quot; My reading has the advantage of extending a benefit of the doubt to the novelist, a benefit earned by the sustained critical attention he&#39;s received, though also, generally speaking, a benefit that should be extended to anything you read.</p>

<p>What do you mean by Delillo&#39;s &quot;narrative voice?&quot; I mean this sincerely, because I see quite a wide range of variation between <em>Libra</em> and <em>Cosmopolis</em>. If other readers haven&#39;t felt this reaction--or at least not as strongly--does it then mean that they lack your well-developed judgment, a critical discernment born of erudition profound and rare analytic acumen? Would you believe people telling you that your work was profound? If you allow the possibility that you yourself might be skeptical of your admirers, could you not extend this same charity to Delillo?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-10674226-content"><p>You&#39;re certainly right on the first count: Baudrillard irritates me immensely...but I do believe my irritation is instigated by the features of his text.  For example, take this passage from <i>America</i>:</p>

<blockquote>I went in search of astral America, not social and cultural America, but the America of the empty, absolute freedom of the freeways, not the deep America of mores and mentalities, but the America of desert speed, of motels and mineral surfaces. I looked for it in the speed of the screenplay, in the indifferent reflex of television, in the film of days and nights projected across an empty space, in the marvellously affectless succession of signs, images, faces, and ritual acts on the road; looked for what was nearest to the nuclear and enucleated universe, a universe which is virtually our own, right down to its European cottages.</blockquote>

<p>His rhetoric here doesn&#39;t jive with his function as a social critic; if anything, it&#39;s more pseudo-Nietzschean gestures in the general direction of the profound.  His rhetoric <i>is</i> a feature of his work, and it does irritate me.  That you slipped from speaking of Baudrillard to &quot;extending a benefit of the doubt to the novelist&quot; points to part of my problem with him: it&#39;s easy to mistake his metaphysical noodlings for fiction and defend them on that account.  But they aren&#39;t fiction...although Douglas Coupland ably parodied thoughts of equal &quot;complexity&quot; in <i>Generation X</i>.  </p>

<p>As for DeLillo&#39;s &quot;narrative voice,&quot; first let me say that I always forget about <i>Libra</i> when I have this conversation, but that <i>Libra</i> is the rule-proving exception.  Every other book he&#39;s written has the same world-weary narrative voice, one laced with nostalgia for worlds which never existed, one always pining, always empty at its core, always having to go to condom superstores in suburban malls in order to discover itself...<i>again</i>.  For the fifteenth novel now.  I could pull umpteen passages from <i>Underworld</i>, stick them next to passages from <i>The Names</i> or <i>Mao II</i> or <i>White Noise</i> and demonstrate this (and perhaps later today, when this stack of papers in need of grading dwindles, I will), but needless to say his narrative voice, outside of <i>Libra</i>, always occupies two positions in his books: it is the voice of the omniscient or semi-omniscient narrator; it is the interior voice of the narrator (whoever it may be, man, woman, poor, rich, black, white, &amp;c.) through whom sub-sections of his novels are focalized.  Whenever he wants us to sympathize with a character, the distinction between his voice and his character&#39;s collapses.  </p>

<p>Do I think my awareness of this means I&#39;ve a refined sense of literary voice?  Depends on what you mean by refined.  Too refined to find pleasure in a Dan Brown novel?  Yes.  But my reaction isn&#39;t atypical, nor do I have to imagine it as such in order to defend it on its principles: Novelist A does this, Novelist B does this.  One is better than the other because he or she realizes their intentions.  If the intention is to, say, write in the voice of an uneducated, homeless African-American male, then I can judge the novelist on whether he or she has done so successfully.  In DeLillo&#39;s case, the answer&#39;s an emphatic &quot;NO!&quot;  The uneducated, homeless African-American male will either sound <i>exactly</i> like the wealthy, Harvard-educated Caucasian male through whom most of the book is focalized <i>or</i> it will sound like that self-same male in black-face.  In both cases, DeLillo fails in the extreme.  Now that I&#39;m thinking about this more, I&#39;ll write something more tangible, less angsty along these lines later this afternoon.  </p></span>

I&#39;ll respond to your reading of <i>White Noise</i> later this afternoon, then; I think there&#39;s an element of his wanting to both rib and steal the mantle of profundity in that book (which, as I acknowledged earlier, I don&#39;t consider a complete failure).  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-10678948-content"><p>Stephan: &quot;Alas, you need to be a citizen before getting the free health care. And that could take a few years.&quot;</p>

<p>I think that you start to get the free health care either zero or six months (depending on which province you move into) after being officially admitted into the country as a resident.  I don&#39;t think you need to be a citizen.  The process for being admitted as a resident is difficult enough.  And yes, I would guess that if you&#39;ve been a Canadian citizen before, you probably still have dual citizenship or something.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t been as impressed by Cadigan, although I&#39;ve only read two of her books.  Any of _Islands in the Net_, _Schismatrix Plus_, or _Holy Fire_ by Sterling are, I think, better than _Snow Crash_.  _Islands in the Net_ is the archetypal cyberpunk novel with actual political involvement, which Gibson is too surface-obsessed for and Stephanson too techo-determinism-enthralled.  _Schismatrix Plus_ gets to cheat because it incorporates excellent short stories that are better than the attached novel.  _Holy Fire_ is an excellent example of a book that had to be written as SF rather than SF-influenced literature or fantasy, a convincing bildungsroman with a 94-year-old protagonist.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/don_delillo_pil.html"><span><strong>Don DeLillo, Pillow.  Pillow, Don DeLillo; or (muffled screams)</strong> The popular press fête few novelists with the intensity which accompanies each new Don DeLillo &quot;event.&quot; So before I crashed the party I decided I should see whether anyone else had. Thanks to Gale's Expanded Academic ASAP, I now know I'm not alone. Earlier Jonathan chided me for &quot;an unfortunate and inaccurate comparison to Baudrillard [un]worthy of Dale Peck.&quot; My only (admittedly lame) defense consisted of a frank admission that I thought the comparison both obvious and apropos. So I delight in communicating that someone else considers the comparison equally apt: in his review of Cosmopolis, James Wood makes a strikingly similar observation: Eric [Packer] is given to riffing on contemporary culture and technology, in a Baudrillard-bruised language evocative of an assistant professor of cultural studies with, alas, an MFA: &quot;He took out his hand organizer and poked a note to himself about the anachronistic quality of the word skyscraper. No recent structure ought to bear this word. It belonged to the olden soul of awe, to the arrowed towers that were a narrative long before he was born.&quot; Or: &quot;He was thinking about automated teller machines. The term was aged and burdened by its own historical memory. It worked at crosspurposes, unable to escape the inference of fuddled human personnel and jerky moving parts. The term was part of the process that the device was meant to replace.&quot; He being James Wood and me being my lowly self, he trumps my bland comparison by coining the compound &quot;Baudrillard-bruised&quot; to describe Packer's language. Still, the fact that his impression of DeLillo-speak dovetails neatly with mine encourages me to perform even greater displays of brazen evaluation. But I need not bother, because Wood has already done the work for me: The difficulty of the book is working out how much of this is Eric's mildly satirized theory and how much of it is DeLillo's indulged and wanton theory. Eric would think just like this, one supposes. But as so often, DeLillo's language seems too complicit, in its scrabbling enthusiasm, with the subject of his protagonist's reflections. &quot;Here was the heave of the biosphere&quot; (whatever that means): alas, this sounds like DeLillo, not Eric. (But then we do not know what Eric sounds like, because he has no quiddity.) It is DeLillo who seems to be excited as he regards &quot;the heave of the biosphere.&quot; Exactly! I too am unable to differentiate between DeLillo's voice and the voices of his various narrators. I took my copy of Underworld from the shelf to prove this, but Wood says it better than I can: Eric Packer's techno-incantations, his amorous ruminations on postmodernity, are continuous with Brian Glassic's in Underworld, the Brian Glassic who stood before the Staten Island landfill and reflected thus on garbage: To understand all this. To penetrate this secret. The mountain was here, unconcealed, but no one saw it or thought about it, no one knew it existed except the engineers ... a unique cultural deposit ... and he saw himself...</span></a></div>
