For Cashill and his mysterious contributors (&quot;[t]he media punishment

case against Obama is a compelling one:</p>
<blockquote><p>What Mr. Midwest noticed recently is that both Ayers in [<em>A Kind and Just Parent</em>] and Obama in [<em>Dreams From My Father</em>]

(To name <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22hog+butcher+to+the+world%22">but a few</a>.) According to Cashill, I have now proven that <em>Dreams From My Father</em> was written by many a dead man of American letters, a <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/06/polygraphlevel-scholarship-may-suffice-for-harmless-speculation-about-the-authorship-of-midsummers-n.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef01157181b597970b#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01157181b597970b" style="text-decoration: line-through;">living</a> mystery writer, a <em>New York Times</em> columnist and the 1967 Illinois Commission on Automation and Technological Progress. That bears repeating:</p>
<p>I have an &quot;A-level match&quot; that proves that Obama&#39;s autobiography was
written by a &quot;study of the economic and social effects of automation
and other technological changes on industry, commerce, agriculture,
education, manpower, and society in Illinois&quot; when Obama was only six
years old.&#0160; If that somehow fails to convey to the dubious merits of
Cashill&#39;s argument, perhaps this will:</p>
<blockquote><p>Returning to the exotic, in his Indonesian backyard
Obama discovered two &quot;birds of paradise&quot; running wild as well as
chickens, ducks, and a &quot;yellow dog with a baleful howl.&quot; In [Ayers&#39;] <em>Fugitive Days</em>, there is even more &quot;howling&quot; than there is in <em>Dreams</em> . . . In [<em>A Kind and Just Parent</em>], he talks specifically about a &quot;yellow dog.&quot; And he uses the word &quot;baleful&quot; to describe an &quot;eye&quot; in <em>Fugitive Days</em>. For the record, &quot;baleful&quot; means &quot;threatening harm.&quot; I had to look it up.</p></blockquote>
<p>You did read that right. Cashill did cite as &quot;A-level&quot; evidence the
fact that Ayers and Obama used a word he didn&#39;t know, despite his being
the Executive Editor of Kansas City’s premier business publication, <em>Ingram’s Magazine</em>; despite his having written for <em>Fortune</em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>, and <em>The Weekly Standard</em>; despite his having authored five books of non-fiction; and despite the word &quot;baleful&quot; having appeared in print <strong><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/files/342.jpg"><span class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115718069f2970b">342 times</span></a></strong> in the past six months alone. Granted, all those appearances were in high-minded literary publications like <em>Newsday</em> (&quot;[w]ith his baleful countenance, wild hair, sonorous baritone and sage pronouncements&quot;) or leftist rags like <em>The Washington Times</em>
(&quot;warn them in baleful tones if they&#39;ve forgotten, say, the
Constitution&quot;), so it would be unreasonable to expect Cashill to have
been familiar with the word . . . or would be, were it not for the fact
that it also appears <strong><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:http://www.americanthinker.com/+baleful&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off" mce_href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:http://www.americanthinker.com/+baleful&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off">19 times</a></strong> in the pages of the <em>American Thinker</em>, the publication for which Cashill penned this tripe. (Seems he can begin his careful literary analysis of the other <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=baleful" mce_href="http://www.google.com/search?q=baleful">848,000 potential ghost writers</a> closer to home.)</p><p>
</p>

<p>Fortunately for Cashill, his argument is not entirely based on
demonstrations of ignorance and popular misquotations (which, when you
think about it, is more along the lines of literary <em>detection</em> than literary <em>criticism</em>
anyway), as when he claims that Ayers and Obama are unique among
memoirists in their fascination with eyes: &quot;Ayers is fixated with
faces, especially eyes [and] Obama is also fixated with faces,
especially eyes.&quot; Having performed an extensive study of
autobiographical writing, Cashill knows how unique this fixation with
eyes is. Consider this passage from <em>Dreams From My Father</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Peter said Peter said eyes are always and eyes are
always. Peter said Peter said, eyes are always and Peter said eyes are
always. Peter said eyes are always. Peter said eyes are always.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sorry—that was Gertrude Stein. Here&#39;s the passage from <em>Dreams From My Father</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whenever I looked in her direction she had her eyes on
me. The face she had! The eyes! She lay streched out on the floorboards
with her hands under her head and her eyes closed. Sun blazing down,
bit of a breeze, water nice and lively. I noticed a scratch on her
thigh and asked her how she came by it. Picking gooseberries, she said.
I said again I thought it was hopeless and no good going on, and she
agreed, without opening her eyes. I asked her to look at me and after a
few moments—after a few moments she did, but the eyes just slits,
because of the glare. I bent over her to get them in the shadow and
they opened. Let me in. We drifted in among the flags and stuck. The
way they went down, sighing, before the stem! The eyes she had!</p></blockquote>
<p>Sorry—that was <a href="https://www.msu.edu/%7Esullivan/BeckettKrapp.html" mce_href="https://www.msu.edu/~sullivan/BeckettKrapp.html">Samuel Beckett</a>.
If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d be inclinced to argue that works that are
overtly concerned with the act of remembering and the limitations of
memory tend to obsess over the eye and its punned hononym (&quot;I&quot;).
Actually, I do know better, so I will: be they modernist
experimentations about subjectivity or humble autobiographies, works
that concern themselves with the act of remembering and the limitations
of memory tend to obsess over the eye and its punned homonym (&quot;I&quot;).</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#39;s unfair of a professional literary critic to expect
Cashill to have intimate knowledge of literary modernism. I should cut
him some slack and let him perform the kind of close stylistic analysis
that I teach my students. Maybe he can handle something simple, like
diction:</p>
<blockquote><p>To this point, I have just skimmed the 759 items in the
bill of particulars in my case against Obama&#39;s literary genius. Not
familiar with the term &quot;bill of particulars?&quot; Uncertain myself, I
looked that one up too. It means a list of written statements made by a
party to a court proceeding. Ayers and Obama each refer knowingly to a
&quot;bill of particulars.&quot; Doesn&#39;t everyone?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is no.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cashill is on to something here. The phrase &quot;bill of particulars&quot; is
an uncommon construction, and its repeated use indicates that the
speaker has a specialized vocabulary in which this construction
regularly appears. According to LexisNexis, this is exactly the case:
in the past six months, that exact phrase has been written <strong><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/files/billofparticulars.jpg"><span class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011571806d22970b">509 times</span></a></strong> and every single one of them looks like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>United States v. Clark, NO. 05-6507, UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT, 09a0422n.06;, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS
12940; 2009 FED App. 0422N (6th Cir.), June 15, 2009, Filed, NOT
RECOMMENDED FOR FULL-TEXT PUBLICATION. SIXTH CIRCUIT RULE 28(g) LIMITS

A PROCEEDING IN A COURT IN THE SIXTH CIRCUIT. IF CITED, A COPY MUST BE
SERVED ON OTHER PARTIES AND THE COURT. THIS NOTICE IS TO BE PROMINENTLY
DISPLAYED IF THIS DECISION IS REPRODUCED.</p></blockquote>
<p>The only people who regularly use the phrase &quot;bill of particulars,&quot; then, are <em>lawyers</em>, and since Bill Ayers isn&#39;t a lawyer, I think we can all agree that Cashill is right: Obama <em>is</em> the author of Bill Ayers&#39; <em>Fugitive D</em>—<em>wait a minute</em>!</p><p><strong>UPDATE.&#0160; </strong>I added links to pictures of the LexisNexis searches after a few people complained they couldn&#39;t access the results themselves.</p><p><strong>UPDATE II.&#0160; </strong>Welcome readers of <em><a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/?p=23366">Balloon Juice</a></em>, <em><a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/06/giving-morons-beating-they-deservea.html">Lawyers, Guns, and Money</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/">Making Light</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/?last_story=/politics/war_room/2009/06/29/cashill_ghostwrite/">Salon</a></em>.&#0160; Kick up your feet, flip through the archives, or head right to <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/05/be-the-first-on-your-block-to-collect-them-all.html">the good</a>/<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my_morning.html">best stuff</a>.</p><p>(<em><a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/06/28/polygraph-level-scholarship-may-suffice-for-harmless-speculation-about-the-authorship-of-midsummers-night-dream-but-not-for-dreams-from-my-father-too-much-is-at-stake/">x-posted</a></em>.)</p>

<p><i>And he uses the word &quot;baleful&quot; to describe an &quot;eye&quot; in Fugitive Days.</i></p>

<p>I&#39;d hazard a guess that &quot;baleful&quot; is used to describe an eye, a glance, a gaze, a glare, or some other ocular noun more than any other class of noun.  By now, &quot;baleful&quot; practically means &quot;Hostile, esp. of the eyes or gaze.&quot;  Far from being some proof of authorship, it&#39;s actually a near-cliche.</p></span>

<p>Interestingly, I&#39;m fairly sure that baleful came from the Celtic myth of Balor, the Firbolg (giant) king, who had one giant eye that would slay anyone who it looked upon, who slew Nuada of the Silver Arm, and was in turn slain by Lugh, the son of the Sun. </p>

<p>tomemos, I almost snarked about Obama and Ayers having a penchant for &quot;eyes&quot; instead of eyes, but that seemed one step too far.  </p>

<p><em>the Stein-Beckett-Obama connection is chilling</em></p>

<p>Ahem:</p>

<blockquote>Being President is funny being yourself is funny as you are never yourself to yourself except as you remember yourself and then of course you do not believe yourself to be the President . . . you do not really believe yourself why should you, you know so well so very well that the President is not yourself, the President could not be yourself because you cannot remember right and if you do remember right it does not sound right and of course it does not sound right because it is not right.  You are of course never the President to yourself because you are black and have a funny name.</blockquote>

<p><em>That&#39;s weird. I (StevenAttewell) wrote that last line.</em></p>

<p>And the others one too, right Steven?  I think I&#39;m missing something (or TypePad&#39;s HTML is screwy again).</p>

<p><em>What, no quotes from Georges Bataille? Aren&#39;t they teaching you literary types the classics anymore?</em></p>

<p>Ben, normally people ask whether I named the blog <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ac%C3%A9phale" rel="nofollow">after Bataille</a>, not whether I&#39;m familiar with him.  Which I am, mind you, but us fancy folks aren&#39;t supposed to admit we&#39;ve read voyeuristic novels that border on pornography (unless they&#39;re written by Joyce).</p>

<p><em>One of Cashill&#39;s books is entitled How Intellectual Hucksters Have Hijacked American Culture, and should probably be subtitled The Jack Cashill Story.</em></p>

<p>CP for the win!</p>

<p><em>Anyone younger than 50 has never heard of the Mekong Delta. True Fact!</em></p>

<p>Well, duh.  Wait, what was that?  Swift boat what?  Huh?  Anyway, yes, Cashill for the win!</p></span>

<p>Probably not. Bale, in the sense baleful uses, comes from Anglo Saxon via the proto-Germanic <i>*balwom</i>. Cognate with Old High Germanic <i>balo</i>, Old Frisian <i>balu</i> and Old Norse <i>bol</i>. Most likely derived from the PIE base <i>*bheleu-</i> &quot;to beat.&quot;</p>

<p>I do not know for sure but I&#39;d hazard to guess that Balor, like the Norse Baldr, derives from a root word for &quot;prince&quot; or &quot;lord&quot; that also gave Old English the word <i>baeldor</i>. Most likely the PIE root <i>*bhel-</i>, &quot;to swell (with strength or pride)&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be surprised if the semitic <i>baal</i> had anything to do with it (baleful or balor that is), but it&#39;s not outside the realms of possibility what with Phoenician traders visiting Britain as early as 1500 BCE and Celtic raiders troubling Anatolia from the 5th century BCE onwards.</p></span>

<p>Nope, I&#39;m pretty sure nobody has as yet taken up the &quot;Ed McBain&quot; mantel, but even if somebody had it&#39;d still be false or, at the very best, highly misleading to say &quot;Ed McBain is a living mystery writer&quot; (if I published a book under the pseudonym &quot;Mark Twain&quot; with the permission of his estate, would that make &quot;Mark Twain is a living American writer&quot; a true proposition?)<br />
Incidently, &quot;Evan Hunter&quot; is also a pseudonym.  His real name was Salvatore Lombino.</p></span>

Culturally Imperial? Morbidly Culturally Imperial?</strong> Am I alone in finding the whole idea of Infinite Summer a little morbid? The renewed interest in David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest is an obvious Good Thing—a first step toward popular as well as academic canonization—but having lived through the recent Michael Jackson Media Event, I can’t help but wonder whether the desire to read Wallace’s novel is akin downloading Thriller because Some Important Someone died. Do I sound like I’m thwacking some straw man with shovel? Because I’m not: I have a confession to make. I don’t even like David Foster Wallace. And I don’t mean that I found Infinite Jest too lengthy on the first run-through. I mean his accessible stuff. His tales from cruise ships and lobster festivals and tennis matches and radio studios . . . So why am I here? The short answer is that David Foster Wallace died. That’s Ezra Klein, writing at A Supposedly Fun Blog. I’m not complaining because famous bloggers (Matthew Yglesias and Julian Sanchez among them) are horning in on my territory—although I will note that the first thing I ever published online was a mediocre seminar paper titled “Demand and the Appearance of Freedom: The Role of Corporate Media in David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest,” but only just to note it—nor, despite the above, am I really even complaining that Klein’s interest was piqued by Foster Wallace’s suicide, as a more charitable excerpt shows his interest to be far less morbid: The slightly longer answer is that David Foster Wallace died and I cared. That was, to me, a surprise. Lots of people die. Just the other day, Ed McMahon died. It hardly registered. But Wallace was different. I read everything I could about his final days. I posted a memoriam on my site. I watched readings on YouTube. It affected me. I don’t know if it’s because he was a young writer who was felled by the violent bubble and froth of his own mind and that a small part of me relates to that. I don’t know if it’s because he was, in some way, unique to my generation, and as such, one of my own. In the end, what’s interesting about the 25-year-old Klein’s post about the 46-year-old Foster Wallace’s novel is the notion that someone who was 18 years old when the Clash first performed in America and someone who was 18 years old the year Joe Strummer died can be said to belong to the same generation. How does that work? I’m tempted to blame it on the Internet: Once you could identify someone’s taste by the cut of their concert tee—London Calling vs. Combat Rock, The Clash vs. Operation Ivy, Operation Ivy vs. Rancid, &amp;c.—now that all these these bands (mostly) belong to the past tense, they’re part of that enormous cultural pool from which more recent generations sample freely. For example, someone Klein’s age will never experience the pain of the endless, fruitless search for something like the first Clash album...</span></a></div>
