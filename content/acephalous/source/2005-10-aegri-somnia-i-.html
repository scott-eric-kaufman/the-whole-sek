You may also wish to read John Leonard's review of it in The New York Review of Books.] My followup to this post on Foucault's still in the works. In it I'll tie up a few of the criticisms commenters at Long Sunday level, but it proceeds slowly—more slowly even than this damn chapter—and I am a very tired boy. Also in the works: a sustained account of Joan Didion's The Year of Magical Thinking. So far I've bleated and pointed in the opposite direction. Now I'll talk it head on. Not now now, mind you, because sustained analysis isn't possible when you're as tired as I am. How tired am I? Polite of you to ask: Of the past seventy-two hours a grand total of four of them have been spent asleep. Why? That's the funny thing about it: I thought I didn't know why, and it only occurs to me now that I do know why, only I've been so tired I couldn't remember. Since the Big Scary Monster of last year I've been on thyroid hormone replacement therapy, i.e. small doses of levothyroxine every morning. Whenever they change my dosage, I have insomnia. Last Friday they upped my dosage but somehow this slipped my mind. So instead calmly understanding that I wouldn't be able to fall asleep as easily as I typically do, I had one of those insomnia-induced panic attacks, complete with tossing, turning, the choking-back-tears-of-frustration, &amp;c. So tired was I on Saturday that I even though I took my levothyroxine that morning, it still didn't occur to me as I stared sleeplessly at the ceiling Saturday night that my insomnia had a specific and familiar somatic origin. It didn't occur to me until this afternoon. As in Tuesday &quot;after two more sleepless nights&quot; afternoon. So today a couple of scattered thoughts—call it &quot;lucid dreaming&quot; posting—which I'll collect with some presently even more scattered later in the week. The first concerns Didion's implicit contention that John Dunne's &quot;sudden&quot; death could have been prepared for had she seen the signs. Two nights before his death, for example, Didion recalls John asked me if I was aware how many characters died in the novel he had just sent to press, Nothing Lost. He had been sitting in his office making a list of them .... Some months after he died I picked up a legal pad on his desk to make a note. On the legal pad, in very faint pencil, his handwriting, was the list. Why was the pencil so faint, I wondered. Why would he use a pencil that barely left a mark. When did he begin seeing himself as dead? She catalogs all the behaviors which would have had symbolic meaning had she the perspicacity to notice them at the time. As the book progresses,..." />

<p>My followup to <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/on_the_kind_of_.html">this post</a> on Foucault's still in the works.&nbsp; In it I'll tie up a few of the criticisms commenters at <a href="http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2005/10/on_the_kind_of_.html">Long Sunday</a> level, but it proceeds slowly—more slowly even than this damn chapter—and I am a very tired boy.&nbsp; Also in the works: a sustained account of Joan Didion's <em>The Year of Magical Thinking</em>.&nbsp; So far I've <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/joan_didion_on_.html">bleated</a> and <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/im_always_stumb.html">pointed in the opposite direction</a>.&nbsp; Now I'll talk it head on.&nbsp; Not <em>now </em>now, mind you, because sustained analysis isn't possible when you're as tired as I am.&nbsp; How tired am I?&nbsp; Polite of you to ask:</p>

<p>Of the past seventy-two hours a grand total of four of them have been spent asleep.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; That's the funny thing about it: I thought I didn't know why, and it only occurs to me now that I do know why, only<em> I've been so tired I couldn't remember.&nbsp; </em>Since the Big Scary Monster of last year I've been on thyroid hormone replacement therapy, <em>i.e. </em>small doses of levothyroxine every morning.&nbsp; Whenever they change my dosage, I have insomnia.&nbsp; Last Friday they upped my dosage <em>but somehow this slipped my mind</em>.&nbsp; So instead calmly understanding that I wouldn't be able to fall asleep as easily as I typically do, I had one of those insomnia-induced panic attacks, complete with tossing, turning, the choking-back-tears-of-frustration, &amp;c.&nbsp; So tired was I on Saturday that I even though I took my levothyroxine that morning, it still didn't occur to me as I stared sleeplessly at the ceiling Saturday night that my insomnia had a specific and familiar somatic origin.&nbsp; It didn't occur to me until this afternoon.&nbsp; As in Tuesday &quot;after two more sleepless nights&quot; afternoon.</p>

<p>So today a couple of scattered thoughts—call it &quot;lucid dreaming&quot; posting—which I'll collect with some presently even more scattered later in the week.&nbsp; The first concerns Didion's implicit contention that John Dunne's &quot;sudden&quot; death could have been prepared for had she seen the signs.&nbsp; Two nights before his death, for example, Didion recalls</p><blockquote><p>John asked me if I was aware how many characters died in the novel he had just sent to press, <em>Nothing Lost</em>.&nbsp; He had been sitting in his office making a list of them .... Some months after he died I picked up a legal pad on his desk to make a note.&nbsp; On the legal pad, in very faint pencil, his handwriting, was the list.</p>

<p>Why was the pencil so faint, I wondered.</p>

<p>Why would he use a pencil that barely left a mark.<br /><em><br />When did he begin seeing himself as dead?</em></p></blockquote><p>She catalogs all the behaviors which would have had symbolic meaning had she the perspicacity to notice them at the time.&nbsp; As the book progresses, it becomes apparent that the act of reading <em>The Year of Magical Thinking </em>constitutes one such symbol.&nbsp; All who die after having purchased it before before finishing it, having finished only half of it, or even having finished it—all would leave their act of reading behind as a symbol their families should have, but failed, to notice.&nbsp; Because by Didion's logic, each of these acts—purchasing, half-finishing, finishing—will be later be invested with unbearable meaning.&nbsp; Thinking about purchasing Didion's book would be sufficient.&nbsp; <em>Even reading another book or essay or thinking about reading another book or essay by Didion would be sufficient</em>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>My other inaugural thought concerns this sentence:</p><blockquote><p>This attempt to make sense of the period that followed, weeks and then months that cut loose any <em>fixed idea </em>I had ever had about death, about illness, about luck, about good fortune and bad, marriage and children and memory, about grief, about the ways in which people do and do not deal with the fact that life ends, about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>The &quot;fixed idea,&quot; the calcified thought, the one which refuses to change no matter the shape of the world, is the centerpiece of Didion's attack on the Bush Administration in &quot;<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/15984">Fixed Opinions</a>.&quot;&nbsp; (The essay would later be published as <em><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?product_id=1147">Fixed Ideas: America Since 9/11</a> </em>by the NYR Press.)&nbsp; In the essay, she defines a &quot;fixed opinion&quot; as follows:</p><blockquote><p>We have come in this country to tolerate many such fixed opinions, or
national pieties, each with its own baffles of invective and counterinvective, of euphemism and downright misstatement, its own
screen that slides into place whenever actual discussion threatens to
surface. We have for example allowed American biological research to
fall behind that in countries where stem cell programs are not confused
with &quot;cloning&quot; and &quot;abortion on demand,&quot; countries in other words where
rationality is not held hostage to the posturing of the political
process.</p></blockquote><p>Unlike the Administration's &quot;fixed ideas&quot; about the meaning of 11 September 2001, Didion's idea of death alters as she comes to terms with it.&nbsp; Instead of petrifying it becomes ever more malleable.&nbsp; To elevate Didion's mind above those who spout &quot;baffles of invective&quot; designed to derail &quot;unacceptable&quot; questions is to point to the sky and declare it up.&nbsp; There's no need to do it.&nbsp; Which is why in what follows I'll write something far less suggestive and far more solid.&nbsp; In the meantime, I present the following random facts:</p>

<ol><li>Had there been a word of the day today, it would have been &quot;umbethink,&quot; because it means something between &quot;remember&quot; and &quot;think,&quot; suggesting the interwoven nature of past and present thought in the moment of thinking.&nbsp; As in this <a href="http://www.oed.com/"><em>OED</em></a> citation: &quot;Let me unbethink myself a little.&quot; (This, obviously, is an example of that beast Stephen calls &quot;pot logic.&quot;)</li>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases">This</a> is the best Wikipedia page ever.&nbsp; It will enable me to be more pompous than you've ever thought possible.&nbsp; Now instead of saying &quot;no offense,&quot; I'll throw out an &quot;<em>absit injuria verbis</em>.&quot;&nbsp; When I want to describe my theoretical approach, I'll shout &quot;<em>AD FONTES!</em>&quot; (&quot;TO THE SOURCES!&quot;) in my best to-The-Batmobile voice.&nbsp; For now, however, I conclude this grab-bag with the final phrase of so many Roman comedies: &quot;<em>Acta est fabula.&nbsp; Plaudit!</em>&quot;</li></ol>

		<span id="comment-10303086-content"><p>I don&#39;t share fully your love for Didion, Scott, so take this with a grain of salt. (White Album, Slouching--fabulous, but also great because of both their context and some of their built-in limitations.  The other stuff, fiction and non-, seems to me mainly pale imitation.  Political Fictions and Where I Was From, I thought were, well, not good.) Here&#39;s the question for me.  Didion&#39;s account of the fixed idea, or of the dangers of narrative: is it not something of an idee fixe itself?  (In fact, my reflex reaction is to say that you see Didion run up against the limits of her political reporting in the fact that the Bush administration is cast in pretty much the same context as the Clinton one, or Bush I, or etc.  Also, the wacko in the crowd as the true America is powerful but just bogus, I think.)  </p>

<p>About Magical Thinking, is the sense that everything appears, misleadingly, significant on the death of a loved one really that unusual?  I don&#39;t mean at all to question Didion&#39;s grief or the accomplishment of her early work, but the bit about the shoes seemed fairly  trite to me.  </p>

<p>Maybe we could have a Didion event at the Valve some day and, um, fully air our differences, as I expect to now be trounced.  </p></span>

I Knew It! I Knew It!  Huzzah!</strong> The news that Daniel Drezner has been denied tenure will no doubt be the topic of conversation for days to come. Reactions have ranged from the predictable to the insightful. The predictable will find some way to blame it on the blog: There are a couple of tentative conclusions to draw, I think. One is that it's probably a very bad idea to blog under your own name if you don't have tenure. Chicken Little, unable to see sky for his self-righteous cries, considers the complex situation and draws some characteristically inane conclusions: How come Drezner didn't get tenure? Same questions, same answers, it seems to me. Maybe it was the blog, maybe someone didn't like his sister. In any case, if I were blogging under my own name, expected to pursue an academic career, and didn't have tenure, I would seriously reconsider the blog. It must have been the blog. Since he's as intelligent as he is well-published, the only reasonable explanation of his denial is the blog. Arguments which assume the blog spelled Drezner's doom deny the how dicey departmental politics are. Drezner may be an internet celebrity but an odd bird in his own department. He may be intelligent but, as some of those who comment their consolations acknowledge, the department may be headed in a different direction. Or perhaps he angered one person on his review board. Perhaps something he had said at a faculty luncheon three years past had rubbed a reviewer raw and submarined his chances. Because tenure reviews occur behind locked doors, neither the candidate nor his readers know the details. To claim the blog exacerabated whatever departmental divisions already existed reminds this blogger of the days after Timothy McVeigh took down the Alfred P. Murrah building. Cries of &quot;Islamic fundamentalists!&quot; tore through the media. This repetition comforted all those who needed explanation. When proved patently false, those who had declared that fundamentalists had torn down our sky shut their mouths and dealt with the more complicated reality that an American had attacked Oklahoma City. I raise this issue not to declare these events commensurate, but to ward the demons of false surety from the congenital conjecturers. The demons want your napes yet here you are augering this and that and claiming academic armageddon has arrived. But maybe it was the blog. Perhaps departmental politics do boil down to some anti-blogger bone. I doubt it. Of course I could be wrong. The University of Chicago could publish a statement explaining the Drezner denial declaring that they really wanted to award him tenure but were threatened by the very thought of his blog. Then I would have to step to the plate and acknowledge that despite all the tangible benefits my blog has brought me—the transatlantic emails from scholars I never would have thought interested in my project and the feedback from interested but not formal academic parties—the dissertation improvements don't outweigh the mere fact of blogging. Grant all that. What matters is the...</span></a></div>

One of the joys of it will be reading all the historical posts people have yet to send me and skimming the ones hastily delivered to my inbox Friday evening at 11:59 PM. I suggest that if you've written or read (nominations being equal in stature to shameless self-promotion) anything of even remote (though I'd prefer intense) interest to historians, historicists, intellectual historians, alternative historians (parse as is your wont) or any of the many historical cognates I neglected to name, send me the link sooner than later. I have a Punch and Judy show of epic proportions planned and celerity guarantees you a meaty role. (Later may play an extra. Late will be obscured by one.)</span></a></div>
