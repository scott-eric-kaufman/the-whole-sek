        <meta name="description" content="Miriam J. shared her edifying despair with Valve readers yesterday. I have had enough despair of late (and face the possibility of more tomorrow). So tonight I offer hope. But first a pinch of despair: I read on average 50 pages per hour. That’s around a book a day (life will intervene), 365 a year. If I squeeze out another 40 years, that’s a mere 14,600 books, which simply will not do. For every classic you haven’t read and should, there are at least five new books you’ll want to read as well. So says LA Times staff writer Susan Salter Reynolds. To which Miriam responds: My mortality is never closer than when I make the mistake of thinking too clearly about the ratio of the ever-burgeoning number of books in the world, to the sliver of books I have read or am yet likely to read. Miriam has a problem. She is unable to imagine how large a number 14,600 is. That's not surprising. Not because I think Miriam deficient, mind you, but because we all have our hrair limits . If following the link clarified little, &quot;hrair&quot; comes from Richard Adams' Watership Down and it means &quot;a number too large to count.&quot; In Adams' novel, the rabbits have a hrair of four. According George Miller's famous essay &quot;The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two,&quot; humans have a hrair of seven . . . plus or minus two. After you hit your hrair limit, not only can you will you be overwhelmed by any novel information, you will also lose the ability to understand the information you were already juggling. That's a damn fine metaphor: Some people can juggle five balls but not six. When someone tosses him a sixth, they all inevitably hit the floor. Other people can juggle six but not seven . . . you see where this is headed. Now consider Miriam's desperation. She will only read 14,600 hundred more books in her life. That statement is approximately 2085 times her hrair limit. She would need 2085 other brains to be able to wrap her mind around her absurd fear of not reading enough. Doesn't everyone feel better already? To strike a more serious note: this anxiety can be overcome by dispensing with the &quot;to read&quot; shelf and creating a &quot;have read&quot; shelf in its place. You will be amazed daily by how much you have read instead of despairing over how much you haven't. The sense of self-satisfaction such a shelf creates positively intoxicates." />

		<span id="comment-11976397-content"><p>How true that is.  Very disconcerting to discover, around age 55, that you are now carting around about two tons of books.  If you buy it, catalogue it like a bookseller would, so that might have some chance of selling it without tearing your hair out.</p>

<p>Offices use a system of shelves that stand and slide on a floor plate, to save space by making the one aisle you need to find the book on the shelf.  If you can afford it, this is a good investment.</p></span>

The place is Louisiana State University. The dippy fellow with the faded Mets cap and frazzled look following Pat McGee to his office is Yours Truly. I wanted to talk to him about why I'd received a B on a paper I'd written about Irish nationalism in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man . As we walked down the hall, he asked &quot;What criticism have you read?&quot; I mumbled my appreciation for William Gass (whose work I had learned of via the most confusing editorial assignment in the history of American literature ) and Camille Paglia (whose work I did not learn about while reading Playboy for the articles). To which he responded: &quot;I meant criticism about Joyce's novel.&quot; Now you see why I earned a B on that particular essay. The point of encumbering you with this trivia?[1] Today I learned that the Queen of Off the Cuff Cultural Studies has resumed writing her column for Salon with (predictably) a review of Madonna's latest album. The atrophy of her once prodigious talent saddens me. The article actually contains the following sentences: That's not what we got—though you'd never know it from the gushing reviews, which applauded the CD for achieving Madonna's purported aim of making people dance. My blood boiled at this insulting reduction of dance music to gymnastics—mere recreational aerobics. I for one do not dance to dance music; disco for me is a lofty metaphysical mode that induces contemplation. The woman I once thought one of the best minds of my time said &quot;disco for me is a lofty metaphysical mode that induces contemplation.&quot; What? I can barely parse that sentence, much less make sense of its absurd implications. How can something which is external to you be a mode you experience internally? Maybe something can inspire contemplation of matters metaphysical, but I'm unable to see how something can be a metaphysical mode. By definition, metaphysical modes have a difficult time being. Part and parcel of the whole metaphysical gig, I thought. Paglia apparently disagrees . . . and chose to voice her disagreement in one of the worst sentences ever written. But not the worst. One commenter topped her in a lucid reply entitled &quot;Camille Paglia is a tight ass&quot;: This lady should loosen her sphincter and shake her ass . . . . . . but preferably not in that order. [1] According to the OED, &quot;encumber&quot; means &quot;to hamper, embarrass with a clog or burden.&quot; I'm not sure whether it's the emphasis on the word &quot;with,&quot; the incongruous nature of clogs and burdens or the idea of someone embarrassing me with a clog or a burden, but I haven't spit on my keyboard in quite some time, so I thought I'd share.</span></a></div>

I can't say why . . . but don't let that stop you from speculating wildly. Have wheelchair-bound clowns sporting Hitler costumes kidnapped me? Did I awake this morning from uneasy dreams to find myself transformed into a gigantic insect who can no longer type or speak? I'm not at liberty to say. That said, I can thank you all for your support and encouragement. I haven't had a stretch this rough in a long time and y'all have helped me through me it.
