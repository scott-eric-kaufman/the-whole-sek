		<span id="comment-80109739-content"><p>I&#39;ve done the copy editing thing - usually with texts that I needed to pay attention to for a one-off reason (so, I needed to have a command of the text for an event, say, but wasn&#39;t planning to use it in my work in a longer-term sense).  I&#39;ve also done the &quot;take notes so detailed I&#39;m practically re-writing the thing&quot; - I used to do this a lot, actually, but I&#39;ve moved away from it - with the exception of the first several works I read in a completely alien tradition or field, when I still find it helpful.</p>

<p>Mainly, at the moment, I try to write about what I&#39;m reading, as I&#39;m reading it - not notes, but something more... sublimated.  The &quot;try&quot; is key:  I&#39;ll read a section, start to write about it, generally realise that I can&#39;t, then start flipping back through the text.  Sometimes I&#39;ll be able to write after a few glances to jog my memory; sometimes I won&#39;t - and then I&#39;ll re-read the text, more effectively this time, fired up by the realisation that, the first time I read it, I absorbed so little....  For whatever reason, the process (at the moment) helps me refocus on the detail of the text, much better than actually taking notes on that detail...</p></span>

<p>Writing about it is key, but if I don&#39;t have the time, I just read the criticism, if I&#39;m lucky enough to be reading something with anything written on it. Why? I like an argument. An article, particularly a <i>bad</i> article, is the easiest way to get me started.</p></span>

<p>When I worked the copy desk one of the other editors would read through everything by pressing either the arrow key to go through stories letter by letter, or option-arrow to go word by word.

		<span id="comment-80144777-content"><p>I like to write about it -- when I have time -- but right now, I tend to read an article/book once  and underline key passages. Then, I go back and read those key passages again (maybe even a third and fourth time). I&#39;m a little bit unusual for a graduate student; I used to take extensive notes in the margins, which I used to summarize passages and ask questions, but I found this process expanded my reading time by astronomical amounts, and it didn&#39;t seem that helpful when I returned to the text. Besides, with my current strategy, I&#39;m actually able to &quot;read a text anew&quot;; one teacher told me that for each class, he always purchased a clean copy of the text, so he was not influenced by his old notes.  </p>

<p>I have never proofread a literary/scholarly text. I know other people have this problem, but I seem to have the opposite curse; in fact, when I read student papers, my internal editor is so effectively &quot;turned off&quot; that I sometimes fail to notice big grammatical problems! :)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-80162219-content"><p>There are three situations where this kind of more deliberate reading comes into play for me.  One is where I&#39;m reading a particularly difficult text (more common with secondary material); the second is where I need to pay particular attention to the structure of text (more common with primary material), and the third is where I&#39;m simply distracted and not reading particularly well (generally common, especially in the evenings).  With the first case I tend to follow Tim Lacy&#39;s formula.  With the second, I rely on multiple rereadings and notes or draft summaries.  With the third, I either try to concentrate/medicate myself into alertness, walk away and come back, or press ahead with an inattentive reading on the premise that a vague understanding is mostly better than none.<br />
I used to use a lot of marginalia, but now tend to restrict myself to flagging useful/interesting sections.  I have done the copy editting thing, but only when encountering papers circulating as word docs, and then only to get them into a state where I can stand to read them.  This makes one supremely attentive to all the reasons why this stoopid paper is a stoopid paper; reasons which the presented of said stoopid paper is uninterested in hearing, and which it would probably be rude to bring up.</p></span>

The Letters are from Satan to his fellow angels, and they document humanity's idiotic attempt to understand the God who created them, i.e. The Bible. Reading it now, two things immediately strike me: The Letters presuppose the existence of God and His Heavenly Host, they simply insist that humans have got the story all wrong. Satan may not be the most reliable of narrators. These facts overlap invidiously in terms of audience: people who would consider Satan a reliable narrator are not people who presuppose the existence of God. Short of members of the Church of Satan‚Äînot founded until sixty years after the Letters were written‚Äîit's not entirely clear who Twain imagines his audience to be within the fiction's framework. Beyond it, his intent is obvious: he employs Satan as a narrator because it galls those he mocks and delights sympathetic atheists. But obvious as it is, the text contravenes it at all turns. For you to buy the legitimacy of Satan's critique, you have to accept that there's an actual Heaven to which the absurd creation of humanity compares. Quick example: I recall to your attention the extraordinary fact with which I began. To wit, that the human being, like the immortals, naturally places sexual intercourse far and away above all other joys‚Äîyet he has left it out of his heaven! The very thought of it excites him; opportunity sets him wild; in this state he will risk life, reputation, everything‚Äîeven his queer heaven itself‚Äîto make good that opportunity and ride it to the overwhelming climax. From youth to middle age all men and all women prize copulation above all other pleasures combined, yet it is actually as I have said: it is not in their heaven; prayer takes its place. They prize it thus highly; yet, like all their so-called &quot;boons,&quot; it is a poor thing. At its very best and longest the act is brief beyond imagination‚Äîthe imagination of an immortal, I mean. In the matter of repetition the man is limited‚Äîoh, quite beyond immortal conception. We who continue the act and its supremest ecstasies unbroken and without withdrawal for centuries, will never be able to understand or adequately pity the awful poverty of these people in that rich gift which, possessed as we possess it, makes all other possessions trivial and not worth the trouble of invoicing. Satan knows from profound coitus, so silly humanity err twice-over: once, for the paltry quality of mundane intercourse; then again, for even leaving its meager attendant joys out of its conception of heaven. The whole work is thus structured around Satan's knowledge of the True Heaven from which he's been temporarily expelled. But his knowledge of God's mind isn't even what he implicitly claims it to be. Consider this bit from the opening narration: &quot;Yes,&quot; said Michael, &quot;and He said He would establish Natural Law‚Äîthe...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/thank-you-god-f.html"><span><strong>Thank You, God, For the Silicon in My Motherboard, the Carbon Dioxide I Expel, the Paper in My Book, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</strong> According to this article, &quot;frozen smoke&quot; or &quot;Aerogel&quot; is a &quot;miracle material for the 21st century.&quot; All well and good. Until you read the comments. &quot;Edmund Burke&quot; opines: If it is produced in the laboratory, it is not a miracle. &quot;Markangelo,&quot; from &quot;Torrance, Amerika,&quot; responds: Why can't &quot;GOD&quot; make a miracle in the laboratory[?] &quot;CK&quot; of &quot;DFW, Texas&quot; answers his question: He did. The Universe that provides the elements that the scientists manipulate to make these wonderful things. Or, did you miss that? &quot;AGS,&quot; from Chicago, attempts to bring some common sense to the proceedings: Please note that &quot;miracle material&quot; is not a theological term implying supernatural origin. It simply indicates unusually outstanding properties and applications that exceed the conventional by a wide mark. He is ignored. &quot;Eric&quot; of Atlanta merely repeats &quot;CK&quot;'s answer to &quot;Markangelo&quot;'s question: He made the silica gel, the carbon dioxide, and the brain of the man that has the arrogance to think he can &quot;make&quot; anything. All glory goes to God. Humanity arrogantly credits itself for His work in the world. To be honest, I hadn't noticed this mode of theistic complaint until it was brought to my attention yesterday. More Twain, again from Letters from Earth: If science exterminates a disease which has been working for God, it is God that gets the credit, and all the pulpits break into grateful advertising-raptures and call attention to how good he is! Yes, he has done it. Perhaps he has waited a thousand years before doing it. That is nothing; the pulpit says he was thinking about it all the time. When exasperated men rise up and sweep away an age-long tyranny and set a nation free, the first thing the delighted pulpit does is to advertise it as God's work, and invite the people to get down on their knees and pour out their thanks to him for it. And the pulpit says with admiring emotion, &quot;Let tyrants understand that the Eye that never sleeps is upon them; and let them remember that the Lord our God will not always be patient, but will loose the whirlwinds of his wrath upon them in his appointed day.&quot; They forget to mention that he is the slowest mover in the universe; that his Eye that never sleeps, might as well, since it takes it a century to see what any other eye would see in a week; that in all history there is not an instance where he thought of a noble deed first, but always thought of it just a little after somebody else had thought of it and done it. He arrives then, and annexes the dividend. For &quot;Eric,&quot; &quot;CK,&quot; and their ilk, nothing is possible without God, therefore all credit ultimately belongs to him. This is why home-runs lead to hosannahs: If God had not blessed a particular athlete with the skills required to hit a home-run, he never would have been able to the swing the bat (whittled from lumber of His stock),...</span></a></div>
