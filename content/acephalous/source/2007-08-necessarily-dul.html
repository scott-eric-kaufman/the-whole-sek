		<span id="comment-79207406-content"><p>Ok, I&#39;ll just say it. I looked at that Will Wilkinson guy&#39;s stuff. He&#39;s just a institute-funded sophist, just like all of the other ones. Stuff like &quot;capitalist inequality is usually quite just, for reasons it&#39;s best not to get into here.&quot; (He&#39;s actually got a point. Did you know the housing projects here are mostly filled with Ivy Leaguers with drinking problems and hedge funders who placed bad bets? All the blacks who were born in them - they live up in the tonier suburbs now, save for a few who bought too many tech stocks...)</p>

<p>And &quot;because Social Security payments aren&#39;t guaranteed by law, and despite the fact that people really love Social Security, we should replace it with IRAs...&quot; Great argument. I was expecting &quot;so we should simply guarantee them by law.&quot; But that would be too easy - best to keep the reader on her or his toes, eh? </p>

<p>I especially love the one on Gore and the fact that businesses know how to capitalize on long-range thinking while governments are doomed by nature to be terrible at that. If you&#39;ve been watching CNBC over the last week, you can really see what Will means. Hundreds of corporations, faced with the question &quot;so what will happen with these ARMs when the rates go up&quot; each, independently came up with the right answer: &quot;We&#39;ll duck and cover, demand government intervention, and failing that, load our pockets with rocks and walk ourselves and the american economy into the surf off Montauk.&quot;</p>

<p>You can literally hear the pressure of Cato money in the tortured sentences. Awful what people will do for a buck. </p></span>

<p>At the risk of accusations of presentism, the way for one to present Spencer&#39;s seemingly boring life is to parallel it, in a limited way, with some other, more recent intellectual whose problematic ideas started a faulty school of social thought.  For instance (many others could do here), what of Milton Friedman and others who believe that &quot;the market&quot; can solve social problems (i.e. that the market has morals)?  One use a prologue and an epilogue to set up the parallel with someone like Friedman - and hopefully forward a few timely points to the twenty-first century reader. - TL</p></span>

<p>Tim, the book&#39;s actually quite interesting, and I&#39;m thinking of writing a little something about &quot;setting the bar low,&quot; which may have Francis&#39; intent.  If so, it&#39;s a lesson to be taken to heart.</p></span>

I aim to net all the big theorists by next week. Imagine the fun you'll have plastering Stanley Fish's wall with questions he already has the answers to. If you comment here under a pseudonym, have no fears about joining: I'll privatize the group as soon as Facebook recognizes my authority over it. (Which should be within the next hour.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/john-ashberryma.html"><span><strong>John (Ash)Berryman, the Most Important Influence on Literate Living Lyricists (despite being Dead himself)</strong> Jonathan Lethem once called The Hold Steady &quot;the John Ashbery of rock bands.&quot; The man must have mistaken his berries. He surely meant to call them &quot;the John Berryman of rock bands.&quot; Consider the opening stanza of Berryman's &quot;Dream Song 1&quot;: Huffy Henry hid the day, unappeasable Henry sulked. I see his point,—a trying to put things over. It was the thought that they thought they could do it made Henry wicked &amp; away. But he should have come out and talked. You can graft that onto many a Hold Steady tune and hear Craig Finn singing it. From the forced alliteration to the stilted colloquialisms to the jarringly sudden last sentence, it sounds like something off Separation Sunday. Plus, the first track on Boys and Girls in America mentions Berryman by name: &quot;Stuck Between Stations&quot; [mp3]. The influence is obvious and I think Lethem must've meant Berryman of course. I admit: Finn's phrasing's damn contagious. It comes from the Berry Man, however, not the Ash of Berries. An understandable mistake. But I come not bury Lethem, but to praise another band which chose to honor Berryman's breakdown and eventual suicide. I'm not the biggest fan of this band, but I must give praise where praise is due: this song haunts me. The band's Okkervil River, the song &quot;John Allyn Smith&quot; [mp3]. (&quot;John Allyn Smith&quot; being Berryman's birth name.) The song's innocuous and pleasant for the first two and a half Berrymanian minutes, but turns brilliant when, for a reason desperately demanding interpretation, it turns into &quot;Sloop John B&quot; [mp3]. That's a traditional song, recorded by many an artist, but Okkervil River break out into the Brian Wilson version, which surely means something. I'm not sure what. Give it a spin and see whether or not you can enlighten me.</span></a></div>
