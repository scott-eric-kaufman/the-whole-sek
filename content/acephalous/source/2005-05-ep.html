<p>[Note to Sean: I find this frustrating and fascinating.]</p>

<p>In my response Sean's <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/warning_this_is.html#comments">request</a> for more on my problems with Walter Benn Michaels' argument in <em>The Shape of the Signifier</em>, I came to the following fruitless conclusion:</p><blockquote><p> what's at issue in debates of History vs. Memory is really a matter of
individual responsibility vs. collective trauma/guilt. Individual
responsibility can be historically compartmentalized, whereas
collective trauma/guilt necessarily extends to all members of the
collective, past, present and future. In political terms, collective
trauma/guilt subtends claims for slavery reparations; furthermore, it
focuses attention on the sins of the past instead of the inequities of
the present (and therefore botches the opportunity to hold contemporary
individuals responsible for the actions that've created/perpetuated
these inequities). I'm with Michaels there. I can see why the
representation of this continuity in literature would also--if we grant
culture this sort of formative power--have implications for politics at
large, i.e. dispense with the idea of collective guilt on television
and in books and movies and people might think differently. But even
though I grant culture the ability to shape thought thusly, I'm not
sure that sense of collective trauma and collective guilt could be
eliminated. Logically, and ideally, it should be; but I'm not sure it's
possible. Without saying that the capacity for this collectivist sense
is hard-wired, I'd say I strongly believe that it's a necessary
by-product of how humans have and will continue to interact. I realize
I've backed myself into a corner, because I not only can't explain why
I strongly believe that, I'm also well aware that I might only believe
it <em>because</em> of the limitations imposed on my horizons by the
cultural moment in which they've been shaped. And, of course, short of
undertaking a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/082647697X/qid=1117217089/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-1563246-7465707?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Gadamerian</a>
intellectual history of the past 3,957 years, I can't responsibly
refute that latter claim. In short, I currently think that that is
necessarily true, but I can't substantiate that claim. </p></blockquote><p>A couple hours later, I've devised a satisfactory way to talk about hard-wired models of historical continuity.&nbsp; I'm going to avoid the claims of evolutionary psychology; that is, I'm not going to try to explain why the collectivist model is a universal human default.&nbsp; Instead, I'm going to demonstrate, quickly, how language is built from the bottom-up and use that bolster the idea of an innate collectivism.&nbsp; So...</p>

<p>...Benjamin Whorf came up with the whole notion of cryptotypes, by which he meant pretty much the same thing Chomsky does by deep structure; namely, a level of linguistic categorization that is not directly visible/audible but explains why a language behaves in a particular way.&nbsp; One commonality of all languages is the dual inclusive/exclusive and plural inclusive/exclusive syntax distinctions.&nbsp; They look like this:</p>

<p>1st person dual inclusive - &quot;you and I&quot;<br />1st person dual exclusive - &quot;he/she and I&quot;<br />1st person plural inclusive - &quot;we two/three/four/etc. and you&quot;<br />1st person plural exclusive - &quot;we two/three/four/etc. and him/her/them&quot;</p>

<p>Clunky though these formulations are in English, in other languages these distinctions are ingrained into the nominal (and pronomial) morphology; not that that matters, as these would be cryptotypes in English anyhow.&nbsp; Now consider verbal morphology: the difference between the caustive verb &quot;kill&quot; and the non-causitive verb &quot;die&quot; aren't captured so well in English, but in Samoan, for example, the causitive/non-causitive distinction is captured by a single morpheme; as if, in English &quot;kill-o&quot; meant &quot;kill&quot; and &quot;kill-om&quot; meant &quot;die.&quot;&nbsp; Nominal and verbal morphology interact to frame everything we talk about, what Talmy Givon calls a &quot;hierarchy of topicality.&quot;&nbsp; What he means is that certain combinations of nominal and verbal morphological interaction trigger particular (and statistically verifiable and, well, pre-verified) grammatical responses.&nbsp; The basic distinctions in his hierachy are:</p>

<p>1) human &gt; non-human<br />2) definite &gt; indefinite<br />3) more involved participant &gt; less involved participant<br />4) 1st person &gt; 2nd person &gt; 3rd person</p>

<p>As Alessandro Duranti explains, languages that &quot;tend to separate human participants who are agents from human participants who are not...group the latter with the object of transitive clauses; hence <em>the woman </em>in <em>the woman ran</em> would be marked the same way as <em>the door</em> in <em>the woman opened the door</em>.&nbsp; Other types of languages might make other kinds of distinctions&quot; (192).&nbsp; These basic distinctions lead to preferred argument structures, and I'd wager, though I've yet to do the work to back this claim up, that the majority of languages not only capture family/clan/society distinctions but can be observed to functionally distribute them.&nbsp; (Some of the linguistics who haunt these parts should chime in.&nbsp; I'm working on the vague memories of my undergraduate days as a linguistic major, and in an attempt to avoid the slightest trace of evolutionary psychology or linguistic anthropology, I fear I may've veered into some irrational abyss.)</p>

<p>A couple of things I'm not saying: </p>

<p>1) that language determines reality or The Real or what-not</p>

<p>2) that these deep structures make certain thoughts impossible to think; Michaels couldn't make the argument he makes if that were the case</p>

<p>3) that these deep structures make certain thoughts <em>easier </em>or <em>more likely to be thought</em> (though I may land somewhere near that position in the future)</p>

<p>Not that I'm obsessing, but I'm going to think about this more and edit this, that and the other sooner than later, and maybe even start a new series called The Statistical Improbability of Walter Benn Michaels Being Correct or something less inflammatory and more respectful...</p>

		<span id="comment-5899247-content"><p>I think you&#39;re right that some sense of group membership is omnipresent and ingrained in language.  But you haven&#39;t made the leap yet between this collectivist sense and Benn Michaels critique of the notion of historical trauma.  I.e., just because one is conscious of belonging to a group doesn&#39;t mean that one believes that one has been permanently marked by the history of that group in a Faulknerian or Morrisonian way.  For example, I&#39;m conscious of being a Canadian and a liberal (in the sense that I hold to liberal ideals, not in the sense that I vote for the Liberal Party, since I don&#39;t) and identify, to a certain extent, with other liberal-minded Canadians, especially in relation to those wacko gun-totin&#39;, bible thumpin&#39; Yankees down South.  But I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been permanently marked by the war of 1812 or indeed any event in Canadian history.  This, however, is a bad example.</p>

<p>A better way of getting at Benn Michaels might instead be to just turn to the evidence of anthropology - i.e., the fact that some, but not all cultures do have some sort of notion of collective trauma or collective guilt built into their culture.  It might be interesting to empirically explore the conditions under which this kind of notion does and does not arise.  It doesn&#39;t seem to be just a recent identity politics thing.</p></span>

Duranti, quoted above, is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0521449936/qid=1117300943/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-1563246-7465707?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" rel="nofollow">this book</a>.

		<span id="comment-5899694-content"><p>Maybe what I was just trying to get at is that there are two separate questions: 1) Benn Michaels&#39;s reductio ad absurdum on identity politics and notions of collectivist identity, collective trauma, etc., all of which seems pretty sound - kind of like marching into Salem circa late 17th c. and saying - look, folks, believing in witchcraft is stupid.  2) The empirical fact that these beliefs do exist, that belief in collective trauma is typical of certain beliefs that occur again and again in different cultures, that it fulfills certain basic needs and that probably no amount of rationalist argument will make it go away.  Although maybe it might get out of literary studies; one can only hope.</p>

<p>All of which I think just repeats your argument, Acephalous.</p></span>

The title of CR's entry floats above a photo of a blitzed and bloated Hitchens: &quot;Hard to copy edit when you're loaded...&quot; According to Gore Vidal, it's easier than it looks. In 1980's &quot;This Critic and This Gin and These Shoes&quot;--a paean to Edmund Wilson on the occasion of the publication of his notebooks and diaries--Vidal notes that the alcoholism that &quot;ended the careers of Hemingway [and] Fitzgerald&quot; and &quot;turned the William Faulkner of As I Lay Dying into a fable&quot; failed to topple Wilson: Meanwhile, the contemporary of these three blasted stars, Edmund Wilson, outlived and outworked them all; he also outdrank them. Well into his seventies, Wilson would march into the Princeton Club and order a half dozen martinis, to be prepared not sequentially but simultaneously—six shining glasses in a bright row, down which Wilson would work, all the while talking and thinking at a rapid pace. To the end of a long life, he kept on making the only thing he thought worth making: sense, a quality almost entirely lacking in American literature where stupidity—if sufficiently sincere and authentic—is deeply revered, and easily achieved. Although this was a rather unhealthy life in the long run, Wilson had a very long run indeed. But then he was perfect proof of the proposition that the more the mind is used and fed the less apt it is to devour itself. When he died, at seventy-seven, he was busy stuffing his head with irregular Hungarian verbs. Plainly, he had a brain to match his liver. Note how Vidal is careful to temper his praise of American literature by reminding his (and its) readers that it is, fundamentally, profoundly nonsense; that &quot;sense [is] a quality almost entirely lacking in American literature where stupidity—if sufficiently sincere and authentic—is deeply revered, and easily achieved.&quot; Wilson, Vidal implies, spoke intelligently and rationally about the boundless stupidity that is American literature. Read generously, Vidal intends something like &quot;Wilson thought and wrote intelligently about something that should've been beneath his notice.&quot; This generosity is rewarded in the review's ultimate paragraph, in which Vidal unveils his real target: English professors who would disagree with Wilson's dictum that no matter how thoroughly and searchingly we may have scrutinized works of literature from the historical and biographical point of view…we must be able to tell the good from the bad, the first-rate from the second-rate. We shall not otherwise write literary criticism at all. After one final cheap shot (in the form of the most marvelous parenthetical insertion I've ever encountered), the essay concludes gnomically: We do not, of course, write literary criticism at all now. Academe has won the battle in which Wilson fought so fiercely on the other side. Ambitious English teachers (sic!) now invent systems that have nothing to do with literature or life but everything to do with those games that must be played in...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/saints_augustin.html"><span><strong>Saints Augustine and Joan, or No Marching Orders, &quot;Just Nuts&quot;</strong> I expect more of my favorite books. I expect to hear the voice of a child whisper &quot;tolle, lege, tolle, lege, tolle, lege, tolle, lege, aut pedicabo ego uos et irrumabo.&quot;* I expect I'll consider that a command given to me by God to open the book and read the first chapter I should come upon.** And I expect that instead of landing on Romans 13 like some African-American Church Fathers,*** I'd land on this passage from Gillian Beer's Darwin's Plots: An aspect of his insistence on congruities, and branchings, was his desire to substantise or substantiate metaphor wherever this could be done. He needs to establish ways in which language may be authenticated by natural order, so that his own discourse and argumentation may be 'naturalised,' and so moved beyond dispute. (49) And instead of finding myself in tears over the fair pear once stolen only to steal, as from Thou, the fairest Pear of all, for I had a store of better...so instead of finding myself doing that I'm counting my blessings that I'll never be numbered among these clowns: Those who teach Judith Butler's work have looked forward to a reader that gathers key parts of her extensive corpus and provides a context in which to understand the major themes and continuities of her eclectic philosophical, psychoanalytic, cultural, and political interventions. Because if I was, I'd be forced to parse this blather... Setting aside for the moment how the media act upon the public, whether, indeed, they have charged themselves with the task of structuring public sentiment and fidelity, it seems crucial to note that a critical relation to government has been severely, though not fully, suspended, and that the &quot;criticism&quot; or, indeed, independence of the media has been compromised in some unprecedented ways. ...when I could've been reading this: We have come in this country to tolerate many such fixed opinions, or national pieties, each with its own baffles of invective and counterinvective, of euphemism and downright misstatement, its own screen that slides into place whenever actual discussion threatens to surface. We have for example allowed American biological research to fall behind that in countries where stem cell programs are not confused with &quot;cloning&quot; and &quot;abortion on demand,&quot; countries in other words where rationality is not held hostage to the posturing of the political process. We have allowed all rhetorical stops to be pulled out on non-issues, for example when the federal appeals court's Ninth Circuit ruled the words &quot;under God&quot; an unconstitutional addition to the Pledge of Allegiance. The Pledge was written in 1892 by a cousin of Edward Bellamy's, Francis Bellamy, a socialist Baptist minister who the year before had been pressured to give up his church because of the socialist thrust of his sermons. The clause &quot;under God&quot; was added in 1954 to distinguish the United States from the atheistic Soviet Union. &quot;Ridiculous&quot; was the word from the White House about the ruling declaring the clause unconstitutional. &quot;Junk justice,&quot; Governor Pataki said. &quot;Just...</span></a></div>
