(143)</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">What I find most compelling about this definition, esp. in comparison to the radical and liberatory training in Marxist, feminist, post-colonial, etc. thought is that this cultural studies, however naive and hide-bound it may now appear, focuses on the necessity of <em>training</em> students to think.&nbsp; Not demystifying them of their ideological baggage, but providing them with the tools necessary for them to demystify themselves.&nbsp; The response from current Cult. Studies proponents is that there's no way to be absolutely certain that teaching students to think for themselves will lead them to draw the &quot;correct&quot; conclusions.&nbsp; To which I respond, again and again and again, that the <em>being a better teacher might be a good place to start</em>.&nbsp; </p>

<p dir="ltr">The problem with teaching one of the favored Cult. Studies paradigms is that they're ideologically inflected on their face.&nbsp; If a student's inclined to agree, he or she will ignore whatever premises the system ignores and draw the conclusions the system's designed to generate.&nbsp; If a student's inclined to disagree, he or she is lost.&nbsp; Theorists could be drilled into the latter student's head <em>ad nauseum </em>but, because of the ideological inflection, their thought will never be taken seriously by the student.&nbsp; In other words, teaching ideologically inflected theories addresses the entire congregation, devotees and backsliders alike; but the backsliders will never return to the fold and the devotees will lead the cake-walks, bake-sales and barn-raisings they would've led anyway.&nbsp; Not to mention the atheists too busy being flamboyantly queer on a West Hollywood Saturday night to care all that much about queering anything come Sunday morning...</p>

				<p>I write this in part because of a <a href="http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the_little_professor/2005/05/advice_to_stude.html">conversation</a> over at the <a href="http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/">Little Professor</a>'s
has me thinking about my own pedagogical imperatives; in particular, to
how they've changed since I've moved from teaching English and
Composition courses to teaching, exclusively, Literary Journalism. 
While the move suits me and I love teaching the course, <em>there's a way in which</em> it doesn't satisfy my social conscience the way that English and Comp. courses do.&nbsp; <em>There's a way in which </em>this article from the way, way back, the before-time, ameliorates some of my qualms.&nbsp; Then again, <em>there's a way in which </em>it doesn't.*</p>

<p>*In case you haven't noticed, when speaking, writing or thinking &quot;there's a way in which&quot; has become my marker of unthought or half-thought thoughts.&nbsp; Thoughts I'm working through or thoughts I have worked through but not to my satisfaction are called to attention by the relentless march of &quot;there's a way in which&quot; to my tongue and finger-tips.</p>

At issue is the behavior of Jerry Rubin in the days leading up to and following the protest. Here is Mailer answering William Kunstler's question about whether he had a conversation with Rubin after the protest: Yes, I did in December in my home. I had called Mr. Rubin and asked him to see me because I was writing an account of the march on the Pentagon. I was getting in touch with those principals whom I could locate. Mr. Rubin was, if you will, my best witness. We talked about the details of the march on the Pentagon for hours. We went into great detail about many aspects of it. And in this period I formed a very good opinion of Mr. Rubin because he had extraordinary powers of objectivity which an author is greatly in need of when he is talking to witnesses. Mr. Schultz, the State's attorney, objects of this insightful look into the characteristics of a good witness. But Mr. Schultz objects, and the court strikes all this testimony from the books. Then, out of nowhere, Mr. Schultz demands that Norman Mailer, one of America's greatest living novelist, be barred from using adjectives in his testimony: Your Honor, would you instruct Mr. Mailer even though he can't use all of the adjectives which he uses in his work, he should say &quot;he said&quot; and &quot;I said,&quot; or if he wants to embellish that, then &quot;I stated&quot; and &quot;he stated.&quot; But that's the way it is related before a jury. I won't comment on &quot;I stated&quot; being an &quot;embellished&quot; form of &quot;I said.&quot; The court, however, did embellish on Mr. Schultz's anti-embellishment directive: We are simple folk here. All you have to do is say &quot;he said&quot;, if anything, &quot;I said,&quot; if anything, and if your wife said something, you may say what she said. &quot;Great Author,&quot; the court pleaded, &quot;We are simple folk here. Our rube ears bend like willows before your ad-ject-ives. Refrain, Great Author, refrain.&quot; During cross-examination, however, the prosecution cast aside its rube ears and started paraphrasing from Armies of the Night, and, interesting enough, so did Mailer. He recapitulated the dilemma that occupies him during much of the book: I was in a moral quandary. I didn't know if I was being scared or being professional and I was naturally quite upset because a man never likes to know that his motive might be simple fear. On re-direct, when asked whether Jerry Rubin had ever used the word &quot;intimidate,&quot; Mailer again tries to summarize his history-as-novel/novel-as-history: It would be impossible for me to begin to remember whether Mr.Rubin used the word &quot;intimidate&quot; or not. I suspect that he probably did not use it...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/evolution_and_i.html"><span><strong>Evolution and The Little White Girl</strong> Art theorists always sound like I sound when I'm bullshitting. I'm utterly incapable of evaluating their claims, esp. when I read a paragraph like the one below from Kathleen Pyne's Art and the Higher Life: Painting and Evolutionary Thought in Late Nineteenth-Century America. According to Pyne, Whistler's The Little White Girl reflects upper-class Anglo-American anxieties about where its members belong in the new Darwinian hierarchy of life. After struggling through her introduction and the first half of this chapter, I think I understand the argument: vigorously upper-class depictions Anglo-American subjects constitute an attempt by the social elite used the Spencerian idea of progress to counter what they perceived as Darwinian red-in-tooth-and-claw nihilism. Paintings like The Little White Girl secure the historic privileges of the elite not only by preserving its aesthetic but by grafting that aesthetic onto a confused Spencerian utopianism. I buy that argument as far as it goes, but I'm disinclined to trust it when I slam into paragraphs like this one: Whistler's spiritualist beliefs and practices in the 1870s would become all-important to his development of a landscape of the unconscious that is evoked through a feminized color mode and the body of woman. As his first attempt to construct an image of the soul, The Little White Girl is ambivalent: while the female body is constricted by masculine will and geometric structuring, the power of feminine imagination, signified in the masklike face and dreaming eye of the mirror image, eludes such rational definition. Whistler attempted to master, control, and constrict the female figure within the geometry imposed by the intellectual act of ordering. The feminine realm of the imagination, concretized in the mirror in the upper region of the canvas, however, remains finally elusive to the willful imposition of limiting, masculine reason. What I do understand about the above paragraph is that it: proceeds from a typical alignment of imagination (good) with the feminine and reason (bad) with the masculine; moves to show how these feminine and masculine principles are in tension; and that privileges the feminine and everything which &quot;eludes such rational definition.&quot; What baffles me is the unverifiability of the claims Pyne makes. She claims Whistler attempts to &quot;master, control, and constrict the female figure within the geometry imposed by the intellectual act of ordering,&quot; but when I look at the painting, that analysis strikes me as utterly contingent upon possibilities she never addresses. Did Whistler choose to paint Joanna Hiffernan indoors or was he commissioned to do so? If commissioned, was it raining heavily for that period of time, and if so, could that have influenced Whistler's decision to paint Hiffernan leaning wistfully against the mantle? Shouldn't the circumstances of a painting's production factor into an analyis of its content? Or am I importing my own (frequentlyl unfulfilled) historicist expectations into art history?</span></a></div>
