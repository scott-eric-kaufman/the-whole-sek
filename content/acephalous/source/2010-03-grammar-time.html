			<p>Lame titular puns never augur well, and this post is no exception, as it concerns something Sarah Palin said in Searchlight, Nevada <a href="http://mobile.politico.com/story.cfm?id=35113">yesterday</a>. Before a crowd of <a href="http://gatewaypundit.firstthings.com/2010/03/cnn-on-size-of-todays-searchlight-tea-party-rally-hundreds-of-people-at-least-dozens/">millions</a>, Palin attacked the &quot;lame-stream media&quot; for being a mixed metaphor, then said precisely the opposite of what I hope she intended to, insisting that &quot;telling people that their arms are their votes is not inciting violence.&quot; </p>

<p>In this case, the verb &quot;to be&quot; is a linking verb that establishes the equivalence of the nouns to its left and right. For example, in the previous sentence, I established that &quot;the verb &#39;to be&#39;&quot; and &quot;linking verbs&quot; are nominal equivalents. Think of it as an equal sign: you can write &quot;Obama is the President&quot; or &quot;The President is Obama&quot; without changing the content of the sentence because
</p><blockquote>Obama = The President</blockquote>
So when Palin said &quot;their arms are their votes,&quot; she may not have been <em>trying</em> to incite violence, but she was saying
<blockquote>arms = votes</blockquote>
That equivalence is best understood in the language of action film clichés, <em>e.g.</em> &quot;Our arms are our votes, and we&#39;re gonna have us <em>an election</em>.&quot; Palin&#39;s supporters will contend that she&#39;s merely explaining a metaphor, and one unfortunate consequence of doing so is using verbs of equivalence to explain what something represents, <em>e.g.</em>
<p style="text-align: center;">
</p><center><br /><p class="asset asset-video" style="display: block; margin: 0pt auto; text-align: center;"><object height="306" width="500"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/t7bdr6fjg-k&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="306" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/t7bdr6fjg-k&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" /><a class="lycatyouffepxygquxfh" href="http://www.youtube.com/v/t7bdr6fjg-k&amp;fs=1"></a><a class="lycatyouffepxygquxfh" href="http://www.youtube.com/v/t7bdr6fjg-k&amp;fs=1"></a><a class="lycatyouffepxygquxfh" href="http://www.youtube.com/v/t7bdr6fjg-k&amp;fs=1"></a><a class="lycatyouffepxygquxfh" href="http://www.youtube.com/v/t7bdr6fjg-k&amp;fs=1"></a><a class="lycatyouffepxygquxfh" href="http://www.youtube.com/v/t7bdr6fjg-k&amp;fs=1"></a><a class="lycatyouffepxygquxfh" href="http://www.youtube.com/v/t7bdr6fjg-k&amp;fs=1"></a><a class="lycatyouffepxygquxfh" href="http://www.youtube.com/v/t7bdr6fjg-k&amp;fs=1"></a><a class="lycatyouffepxygquxfh" href="http://www.youtube.com/v/t7bdr6fjg-k&amp;fs=1"></a></object></p></center>

<br />


But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that, from the universe of potential metaphors, Palin&#39;s people went with <em>the view through a telescopic weapon sight</em>. The crosshairs may be metaphorical, certainly, and what they imply—that people outside a district should contribute money to &quot;take out&quot; the Democrat elected by the people of a district—may be antithetical to the concept of a representative democracy, but the real issue here is the initial decision to employ a sniper&#39;s scope as political imagery.

<p>The linguistics background guarantees that.  I just didn&#39;t want to have to delve into the issue of predicate adjectives, much less degrees of coextension or the infamous &quot;This is that&quot; and &quot;That is this&quot; debate.  </p></span>

<p>Palin is clearly saying something like &quot;The weapons we will use in this fight are our votes.&quot;</p>

<p>Is there some ambiguity?  Sure.  But you have to assume in advance that Palin is the sort of person who believes that Americans should kills their political enemies in order for that reading to make any sense.</p>

<p>Palin is clearly appealing to his fans&#39; sense of themselves as revolutionaries, as gun-lovers, as grunts in the shit of a war against the government.  But she is also clearly not advocating violence, any more than every left-wing academic of the 70s-00s who quoted Marx or Zizek or Fanon approvingly wanted to start anything like a violent revolution.</p></span>

<p>Missed this comment, Fritz.  Sorry about that.  Anyhow, it&#39;s antithetical for the simple reason that local representatives are supposed to represent their constituents, not chits parlayed into national debates.  I know both sides do it, but I&#39;ve never been comfortable with the idea of national pressure brought to bear on elections that are meant to reflect local interests.  </p></span>

<p>Well, a depiction of a room in which windows are broken, lamps are shattered, and a woman is crying because her rapist is threatening to come back with friends isn&#39;t a metaphor for rape so much as a depiction of one.  Granted, it&#39;s difficult to signal that a metaphorical rape&#39;s occurred, so I understand the constraints Click worked under ... but that&#39;s neither here nor there.  This, though, is both:</p>

<p><em>What did all the riffing on arms = votes add?</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m actually a little surprised that you&#39;re in this corner: it seems to me that Palin&#39;s abusing language in order to have her cake and eat it too, <em>i.e.</em> she uses the most violent rhetoric possible but distances herself <em>just enough</em> to be able to claim, in the future, that she in no way influenced Lunatic A or B to do commit whatever felony he or she did.  She <em>wants</em> her audience to make the &quot;arms = votes&quot; equation, because she knows the martial metaphors appeal to them; but she wants to be able to say that she said nothing of the sort at that future, inevitable moment when someone who took her seriously does something horrible.  </p>

<p>So, the equivalence is there for those dogs attuned to the whistle, but it&#39;s also not there, <em>because she says it isn&#39;t</em>, whenever said dogs heed her call.</p></span>

I didn&#39;t see anyone deny that the cartoon depicted a rape.  But, as with all political cartooning, the literal picture is supposed to symbolize political events.  You know, just like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join,_or_Die" rel="nofollow">Join Or Die cartoon</a> (first Google hit for my search) literally depicts a snake cut into parts, but metaphorically stands for the supposed need of the colonies to join together.  How is Click supposed to have signaled that it was metaphorical other than by depicting Liberty being raped?  I mean, yes, stupid, racist, and offensive metaphor.  But still a metaphor.</p>

<p>To answer the current part, well, I&#39;ll be back with a quote in a moment.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0133ec4ab1c2970b-content"><p>OK, here&#39;s a larger quote, with context, from the article that you linked to:</p>

<p>“Now when I talk about it’s not a time to retreat. It’s a time to reload, what I’m talking about — now media try to get this right, OK? — I’m trying to inspire people to get involved in their local elections and these upcoming federal elections,” she told the crowd. “And telling people that their arms are their votes is not inciting violence. Don’t ever let anybody tell you to sit down and shut up, Americans!”</p>

<p>Palin was evidently referring to some previous statement of hers that she thought the media had misinterpreted as a call to violence.  What was it?  Probably <a href="http://community.thenest.com/cs/ks/forums/34058020/ShowThread.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a>, or something similar.  Palin apparently said something like &quot;take up your arms&quot; to her supporters, and she&#39;s denying that she meant to incite violence by saying that.</p>

<p>All right, yes, I agree that saying &quot;take up your arms&quot; to a crowd of angry gun nuts counts as incitement, or at least as dangerous recklessness, whether Palin says it is or not.  Just as putting a picture of a politician inside a circle-and-crosshairs picture counts as incitement, whether the politician says it is or not.  Palin&#39;s denial doesn&#39;t hold water.</p>

<p>But what did Grammar Time! and the equals sign and the whole explanation of metaphors add?  Cleverness?  But I don&#39;t agree with it, and I think that a good number of people wouldn&#39;t agree with it who would agree with the much more simple point.  Palin&#39;s statement &quot;Telling people their arms are their votes is not inciting violence&quot; is not necessarily true or false, and determining whether it&#39;s true or false doesn&#39;t seem to have much to do with what you&#39;re building on top of it.</p></span>

At any rate, the teabaggers do tend to be angry gun nuts. Other arguments: flood insurance cases from the 60s and 70s, also offered as examples of federal government compelling people to buy private good as condition of being a resident; my foreign colleagues, compelled to buy health insurance to be able to work and live in America.</p>

<p>Given the right&#39;s opposition to the expansion of the commerce clause since 1942, I wonder what America would look like if we were to return to a pre Wickard v. Filburn reading of the cc. What would we lose? I suspect the unintended consequences would be enormous.</p></span>

<p>Luther, you might be able to separate an image of a black man who broke into a woman&#39;s house and raped her from the history of white panic, but I&#39;m not sure I can.  </p>

<blockquote>But what did Grammar Time! and the equals sign and the whole explanation of metaphors add? Cleverness?</blockquote>

<p>Apparently not, but what it was intended to add was an explanation as to why she can&#39;t help but use violent rhetoric even when she claims she isn&#39;t.  Maybe it&#39;s a Freudian slip, but it could just as easily have been a dog whistle.  Put differently, denials of this sort are always meant to be made &quot;in no uncertain terms,&quot; and while there&#39;s always some ambiguity in language, Palin&#39;s ambiguity here seemed significant because it <em>undermined the very claim she tried to make</em>.  It&#39;s less crass, but not entirely different from someone saying:</p>

<blockquote>I&#39;ve never in my entire life threatened to kill someone, and I&#39;ll strangle anyone who says otherwise.</blockquote>

<p>Except, you know, she&#39;s not trying to be funny, and it&#39;s quite possible that she just can&#39;t help herself.</p></span>

<p>Well, no.  I think that you may be confused about the sequence of events.  As far as I can tell, it goes something like this:</p>

<p>1.  Palin goes to a rally and says something like &quot;Take up your arms!&quot;<br />
2. News media blame Palin for incitement, based on the &quot;Take up your arms!&quot; comment.<br />
3. Palin goes to another rally after that and says the exact quote I quoted above: {...] I&#39;m trying to get people active in their local elections [...] And telling people that their arms are their votes is not inciting violence.&quot;</p>

<p>In step 3 she&#39;s referring to the remark that she made in step 1.  It&#39;s not that she can&#39;t help herself.  Or maybe she can&#39;t, I don&#39;t know, but when she says &quot;their arms are their votes&quot; she&#39;s referring back to a prior statement.  She can add a reference to votes that may not have been in the prior statement, in order to excuse herself.  But she can&#39;t take the reference to arms out, because then it no longer refers back to what she said, and no longer excuses.</p>

<p>So all of the ambiguity / slip / undermining just becomes the ordinary spectacle of a politician saying &quot;When I said we should bomb them, I meant bomb them with democracy.  And telling people that we&#39;re going to bomb them with democracy isn&#39;t inciting warfare.&quot;  Lame excuse, yes.  Suitable for readings involving grammatical ambiguity, no.</p></span>

As members of parties, a heuristic for voters and a organizational tool for legislative leaders, they&#39;re necessarily taking part in a larger discussion.</p>

<p>Add to this the 17th Amendment, the New Deal, the Great Society, and numerous other actions by the national government that eroded &quot;state&#39;s rights&quot;, and you have a federal government with national goals, overlapping or supplanting the powers and authority of the states.  Members of Congress can’t help but be part of a national discussion, and, as such, those who are interested in that discussion have an interest in the election of members of Congress.</p>

<p>In modern American politics geographically based voting districts have become merely the means of organization, and not necessarily vital in and of themselves.</p></span>

[Updated below the fold.]</strong> But honestly, because he’s proven it’s possible to be gainfully employed in academia and functionally illiterate, I can’t even manage a few moments of schadenfreude. Remember that post I wrote yesterday? The one in which I clearly indicated that I’d condensed a thread’s worth of insults into a nonsensical stream of ad hominem? Donald Douglas not only thinks Jeff Goldstein wrote it, he considers it to be a “deliciously devastating slam.” I’ll take the compliment on its face—the art of collage is an art—but the fact that someone employed by an institution of higher learning found that paragraph compelling is, I think we can all agree, probably the most embarrassing thing someone employed by an institution of higher learning could ever do. The only reasonable response to such a brazen display of idiocy is to take a screen-shot of it and put it on the internet forever: Click to embiggen. Update. Somehow, I always forget that when it comes to missing the point, Douglas will never be topped. He composed a &quot;refutation&quot; of this post in which he admits his error as only he can: The gist of the attack is that somehow I'm functionally illiterate: Because he’s proven it’s possible to be gainfully employed in academia and functionally illiterate, I can’t even manage a few moments of schadenfreude. Sure, to be fair to Skanky Little Scotty, my bad. I could have sworn that was Jeff's comments at the post, &quot;Shorter Jeff Goldstein.&quot; Chalk one up for the Big Bad Boys at Lawyers, Gays and Marriage, where academic giants like Robert Fuckwad Farley stiff good-faith conservatives for a thousand bucks while sucking back a few whiskey sours. As a Cautious Man noted earlier, someone is not aware of all internet traditions; he is, however, attempting to start one of his own. It lacks a catchy name like &quot;Shorter,&quot; but that doesn't mean it doesn't deserve a place in the Hall of Internet Traditions. It goes something like this: You demonstrate that Douglas has no idea what he's talking about. He responds by correcting a typo. I'm not kidding. He responded to a post in which I demonstrated that he has problems with basic comprehension by writing: Little Scotty's schtick is to attack conservatives for bad writing and alleged &quot;functional illiteracy&quot; while demonstrating—once again!—actual functional illiteracy. His proof? I mistyped &quot;version&quot; as &quot;verion&quot; in the &quot;Shorter&quot; post. I hate to be pedantic, but since winding Douglas up is damn entertaining, I will: making a typographical error isn't evidence of &quot;functional illiteracy,&quot; which Wikipedia defines as &quot;a term used to describe reading and writing skills that are inadequate to cope with the demands of everyday life,&quot; e.g. &quot;reading blog posts if you're a blogger.&quot; You're a blogger who by his own admission is incapable of reading blog posts, meaning that by the power vested in me by Wikipedia, I am within my rights to hereby declare you to be &quot;a functionally illiterate blogger.&quot; See how that works? Of course you don't. You...</span></a></div>
