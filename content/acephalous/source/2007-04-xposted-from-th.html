        <meta name="description" content="(x-posted from the Valve) Adam Roberts thinks he can find better evidence of Jack London’s mastery of the art of dialogue than yours truly, a trained Jack London scholar. He is so very, very wrong. I now present an excerpt from London’s play The First Poet, collected in The Turtles of Tasman. The scene: The hill nearest to the plain terminates in a cliff, in the face of which, nearly at the level of the ground, are four caves, with low, narrow entrances. Before the caves, and distant from them less than one hundred feet, is a broad, flat rock, on which are laid several sharp slivers of flint, which, like the rock, are blood-stained. Between the rock and the cave-entrances, on a low pile of stones, is squatted a man, stout and hairy. Across his knees is a thick club, and behind him crouches a woman. At his right and left are two men somewhat resembling him, and like him, bearing wooden clubs ... It is late afternoon. The name of him on the pile of stones is Uk, the name of his mate, Ala; and of those at his right and left, Ok and Un. Uk: Be still! (turning to the woman behind him) Thou seest that they become still. None save me can make his kind be still, except perhaps the chief of the apes, when in the night he deems he hears a serpent.... At whom dost thou stare so long? At Oan? Oan, come to me! Oan: I am thy cub. Uk: Oan, thou art a fool! Ok and Un: Ho! ho! Oan is a fool! All the Tribe: Ho! ho! Oan is a fool! Oan: Why am I a fool? Uk: Dost thou not chant strange words? Last night I heard thee chant strange words at the mouth of thy cave. Oan: Ay! They are marvellous words; they were born within me in the dark. Uk: Art thou a woman, that thou shouldst bring forth? Why dost thou not sleep when it is dark? Oan: I did half sleep; perhaps I dreamed. Don’t leave! The cavemen haven’t even discussed the danger of non-literal speech yet: Oan: They are wonderful words. They are such: The bright day is gone— Uk: Now I see thou art liar as well as fool: behold, the day is not gone! Oan: But the day was gone in that hour when my song was born to me. Uk: Then shouldst thou have sung it only at that time, and not when it is yet day. But beware lest thou awaken me in the night. Make thou many stars, that they fly in the whiskers of Gurr. Did I forget to introduce Gurr? He’s a tiger. You heard me right. The danger of non-literal speech is being eaten by a tiger. Not to mentio—LOOK OUT! O men! O men with the heart of hyenas!

<p>Adam Roberts thinks <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/04/why_all_the_des.html#comment-67424892">he can find</a> better evidence of Jack London’s <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/04/why_all_the_des.html">mastery of the art of dialogue</a> than yours truly, a trained Jack London scholar.&nbsp; He is so very, very wrong.&nbsp; I now present an excerpt from London’s play <a href="http://www.jacklondons.net/writings/TurtlesTasman/first_poet.html"><em>The First Poet</em></a>, collected in <em>The Turtles of Tasman</em>.&nbsp; The scene:
</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The hill nearest to the plain terminates in a cliff,
in the face of which, nearly at the level of the ground, are four
caves, with low, narrow entrances. Before the caves, and distant from
them less than one hundred feet, is a broad, flat rock, on which are
laid several sharp slivers of flint, which, like the rock, are
blood-stained. Between the rock and the cave-entrances, on a low pile
of stones, is squatted a man, stout and hairy. Across his knees is a
thick club, and behind him crouches a woman. At his right and left are
two men somewhat resembling him, and like him, bearing wooden clubs ...
It is late afternoon. The name of him on the pile of stones is Uk, the
name of his mate, Ala; and of those at his right and left, Ok and Un.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Uk:</strong> Be still! (<em>turning to the woman behind him</em>) Thou
seest that they become still. None save me can make his kind be still,
except perhaps the chief of the apes, when in the night he deems he
hears a serpent.... At whom dost thou stare so long? At Oan? Oan, come
to me!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Oan:</strong> I am thy cub.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Uk:</strong> Oan, thou art a fool!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ok and Un:</strong> Ho! ho! Oan is a fool!
</p>
<p>
<strong>All the Tribe:</strong> Ho! ho! Oan is a fool!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Oan:</strong> Why am I a fool?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Uk:</strong> Dost thou not chant strange words? Last night I heard thee chant strange words at the mouth of thy cave.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Oan:</strong> Ay! They are marvellous words; they were born within me in the dark.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Uk:</strong> Art thou a woman, that thou shouldst bring forth? Why dost thou not sleep when it is dark?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Oan:</strong> I did half sleep; perhaps I dreamed.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Don’t leave!&nbsp; The cavemen haven’t even discussed the danger of non-literal speech yet:
</p>
		</div>
					<a id="more"></a>
			<div class="entry-more">
				<blockquote><p><strong>Oan:</strong> They are wonderful words. They are such:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The bright day is gone—</p></blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Uk:</strong> Now I see thou art liar as well as fool: behold, the day is not gone!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Oan:</strong> But the day was gone in that hour when my song was born to me.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Uk:</strong> Then shouldst thou have sung it only at that time, and not
when it is yet day. But beware lest thou awaken me in the night. Make
thou many stars, that they fly in the whiskers of Gurr.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Did I forget to introduce Gurr?&nbsp; He’s a tiger.&nbsp; You heard me right.&nbsp; The danger of non-literal speech is <em>being eaten by a tiger</em>.&nbsp; Not to mentio—<strong><em>LOOK OUT!</em></strong>
</p>
<blockquote><p>O men! O men with the heart of hyenas! Behold, Gurr
cometh not! I did but strive to deceive you, that I might the more
easily slay this singer, who is very swift of foot. Gather ye before
me, for I would speak wisdom...</p></blockquote>
<p>
Where does one even start analyzing a play about cave-people rendered
in a ninth grader’s notion of Shakespearean English?&nbsp; With an
acknowledgment of Uk’s hypocritical use of non-literal speech—he yelled
“Behold! Gurr cometh! He cometh swiftly from the wood!” before crushing
Oan’s skull with his club—and an analysis of what it suggests London
thought about the application of literary techniques and tropes in the
public sphere?&nbsp; (Three guesses as to what I’m working on right now. 
Answers failing to rhyme with “evisceration” will be ignored.)

Better yet—and by &quot;yet&quot; I mean &quot;for you,&quot; a favor you should thank me for in money—two short excerpts: He ate hurriedly, half chewing the bread and washing the unmasticated chunks down with coffee. There was legerdemain in her actions. When these sentences were written in 1906, he was one of the most popular writers in America. Should've stopped him from making sweet, sweet love to Roget. It didn't.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/04/research_how_it.html"><span><strong>Research &amp; How It Warps Your Mind, Part I of Many</strong> When I read this sentence from Jack London's &quot;Up the Slide&quot; this afternoon: Each step became more difficult and perilous, and he was faint from exertion and from lack of Swanson's dinner. The first thing I thought was &quot;I didn't realize they called it a 'Swanson's dinner' back then.&quot; Why? Couple of reasons. The first is that I've known enough destitute Canadians to be familiar with phrases like &quot;Kraft dinner.&quot; The second, that &quot;Up the Slide&quot; is a Klondike story, so drifting into thoughts of things frozen is to be expected. (The story, like many a London Klondike tale, is about the lengths a man will go to not to freeze to death.) It was not until the end of the story, when the character named &quot;Swanson&quot; returned, that I realized I had spent the better part of the story thinking &quot;if only this man searching for gold in 1895 can make it back to camp, he could microwave himself a TV dinner.&quot; Needless to say, this marked the end of my working day.</span></a></div>
