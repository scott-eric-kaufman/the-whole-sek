<p>TMK, the twinge of conscience is a good thing, even if it&#39;s after the fact.  I&#39;m sensitized to this sort of material because my exam lists were on early 20th Century socialist/leftist literature, the staples of which are the Horror of Industrial Accident and future histories like London&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LvNJXadr7R0C&lpg=PA130&ots=q0twum1GoR&dq=jack%20london%20%22a%20curious%20fragment%22&pg=PA130" rel="nofollow">A Curious Fragment</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Scott, I assume tomemos is making fun of the Oppression Olympics, not participating in the games, but if he is -- that is, if you are tomemos, I&#39;m a little surprised that you expected me to write about something there isn&#39;t much reliable information on.  I mean, we know there were protesters in the street again, but I personally don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with the clerics and their possible turning against the Supreme Leader, so the best I could do would be to speculate irresponsibly about what this new rounds of protests means.</p>

<p>cp, same here.  What&#39;s odd is that on my Facebook imported note, the only person who performs actual manual labor made the Wonka joke.  It&#39;s sort of, how to say, surprising?</p></span>

<p>I remember reading an occupational health blog with a weekly list of deaths-on-the-job; one of them was a worker who drowned after falling into a vat of cherries.  That one has shown up in at least one of my poems, I think, because of the extra resonance with the &quot;life is a bowl of cherries&quot; phrase.  Kind of an example of how God&#39;s evil humor can twist anything and turn it into tragedy.</p></span>

Bing. Bing bing? Bing bing bong. &quot;Bong&quot;? Bong.</strong> Kevin Drum convinced me to do what only John Quiggin ever does and you know what? I have a new appreciation for whatever sort of behind-the-scenes filtering Google does. What did I learn when I &quot;binged&quot; my name? The Good: The pieces Kotsko and I wrote for Inside Higher Ed are linked everywhere: Bookforum, conference presentations, librarian sites, departmental pages, course pages. The Bad: You can't search for links through bing, so the best I can do is tell to you search for my name and go through the thirty pages that show up. The Good: People link to and reprint a lot of what I write at Edge of the American West. The Bad: Many of those &quot;people&quot; are spam-type content aggregators that neither link nor credit me as the author. The Good: Acephalous appears on more course and faculty pages than I can shake a hundred sticks at. The Bad: They invariably refer to me as a &quot;graduate student blogger.&quot; The Good: Many people linked to things I've written in an attempt to engage me in a dialogue. The Bad: Google never told me they did this, so these people likely think I snubbed them. (I didn't! Had I but known I would've responded!) The Good: It seems like bing catches content no matter who it's attributed to, such that searching for my name results in links to what I've written even when my name or a link to one of my blogs isn't included. The Bad: One such site must have had my prose in its metadata, because the only thing visible on the page were pictures of a naked white woman surrounded by fifty naked black men. The Good: The image search doesn't turn up any pictures of me. The Horror: It returns seventeen images of a bearded guy who sorta kinda looks like me smoking a series of gigantic bongs and is identified as &quot;Scott Eric Kaufman from California.&quot; Future potential employers take note: that's not me.</span></a></div>

I never comment over there because of one of the folks who does, but Spencer damn near tops my increasingly shorter list of essential morning reads. That said, on those days I don’t have time to read in the mornings, I don’t—because I can’t—read him at all. My brain translates this: Into this: And I just can’t sleep once I’ve see that. (This is less of a post and more of a frank admission of admiration. If all his peers had half his tenacity, DeLong could excise one loathsome category from his site.) (x-posted.)</span></a></div>
