        <meta name="description" content="(Edited because it was supposed to be a draft, as you can tell, what with it not making much sense.) I try to avoid writing about my unintellectual passions here. They're mine, and passionate, but they're not why you read me. That said, since uniquely engaging prose stylings falls well within my ken of expertise, I feel justified in making the following recommendation: If you're at all interested in béisbol, read Joe Posnanski's blog. This recommendation falls into the same category as the one I'd offer in defense of A.J. Liebling's A Neutral Corner: the man can write. He can create and sustain interest in subjects you might not otherwise care about. This is the defining characteristic of literary journalism: orchids weren't my thing before Orlean, and although I had fond thoughts of my undergraduate work in geology, I never yearned to return to before McPhee. Posnanski possesses the same talent: read his column on Bo Jackson and tell me that you, béisbol fans, don't flash back. Non-béisbol fans, read it and tell me that some part of you doesn't want to know what it is us fans flash back to. Writing with impassioned humility, Posnanski's able to riff like this: Hal, in case you don’t know, was a fabulous long-time sportswriter in Cleveland–he co-wrote a book with Satchel Paige, to give you an idea–but he was probably best known for that Sporting News column where he would try to clear up absurd rules questions from readers. Dear Hal: My buddy and I were arguing. Let’s say a player had really, really long legs–or even that he had the sort of superpowers that would allow him to stretch his arms like rubber–and he could touch first base and second base at the same time. Would he be out if you tagged him at that precise moment that he was touching both bags? Is there a rule against touching two bases at once? My buddy says yes, but I think he would be safe. What do you say? Signed: Confused. And then Hal, would respond in some gentlemanly fashion: Dear Confused: Shut up. My favorite Hal-Lebovitz-type column, though, used to run in the Lake County News Herald in the 1990s. I’ve talked about this before, but I never get tired of it … by that time Hal was pretty old and his mind tended to drift a bit–so his columns mostly read like Larry King mocks. But even at that age, Hal had amazing sources, so in the middle of the most ridiculous sections you would have these enormous breaking news stories and remarkable bits of fortune telling. In 1993, the Hal column would read something like this: My wife was in the backyard planting petunias and I told her that I think the petunia has to be the prettiest flower.

<p>If you're at all interested in <em>béisbol</em>, read <a href="http://thesoulofbaseball.blogspot.com/">Joe Posnanski's blog</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This recommendation falls into the same category as the one I'd offer in defense of A.J. Liebling's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0865474958/diesekoschmar-20"><em>A Neutral Corner</em></a>: the man can write.&nbsp; He can create and sustain interest in subjects you might not otherwise care about.&nbsp; This is the defining characteristic of literary journalism: orchids weren't my thing before Orlean, and although I had fond thoughts of my undergraduate work in geology, I never yearned to return to before McPhee.&nbsp; Posnanski possesses the same talent: read his <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/180/v-print/story/124608.html">column on Bo Jackson</a> and tell me that you, <em>béisbol </em>fans, don't flash back.&nbsp; Non-<em>béisbol </em>fans, read it and tell me that some part of you doesn't want to know what it is us fans flash back to.&nbsp;  </p>

				<blockquote><p>Hal, in case you don’t know, was a fabulous long-time sportswriter in
Cleveland–he co-wrote a book with Satchel Paige, to give you an idea–but he was probably best known for that <em>Sporting News</em> column where he
would try to clear up absurd rules questions from readers.</p><blockquote><p>Dear
Hal: </p>

<p>
My buddy and I were arguing. Let’s say a player had really,
really long legs–or even that he had the sort of superpowers that
would allow him to stretch his arms like rubber–and he could touch
first base and second base at the same time. Would he be out if you
tagged him at that precise moment that he was touching both bags? Is
there a rule against touching two bases at once? My buddy says yes, but
I think he would be safe. What do you say?</p>

<p>
Signed: Confused.</p>
</blockquote><p>
And then Hal, would respond in some gentlemanly fashion:</p><blockquote><p>Dear Confused: </p>

<p>
Shut up.</p>
</blockquote><p>
My
favorite Hal-Lebovitz-type column, though, used to run in the <em>Lake
County News Herald</em> in the 1990s. I’ve talked about this before, but I
never get tired of it … by that time Hal was pretty old and his mind
tended to drift a bit–so his columns mostly read like Larry King
mocks. But even at that age, Hal had amazing sources, so in the middle
of the most ridiculous sections you would have these enormous breaking
news stories and remarkable bits of fortune telling. In 1993, the Hal
column would read something like this:</p><blockquote><p> My wife was in the
backyard planting petunias and I told her that I think the petunia has
to be the prettiest flower. She responded that she always preferred the
violet. And I have to admit that violets are nice too … Whatever
happened to Joe Lis? He always seemed like a very nice young man to me
… Don’t be surprised if Art Modell, strapped for money, moves the
Cleveland Browns to Baltimore … I don’t like oatmeal when it’s lumpy.
Smooth, sure, I can eat smooth oatmeal. But lumpy oatmeal is the worst.
I don’t like lumpy soup either. Soup is not supposed to be lumpy. Maybe
if they left the carrots out, it wouldn’t be so lumpy. … The Terminal
Tower is still the tallest building in Cleveland, I think, but I
remember when the tallest building was John Munneli’s house on
Superior. It had to be four stories tall. And that doesn’t include the
basement. I’m pretty sure the Munellis had a basement though.… There’s
a 9-year-old kid in Akron who I hear might be one heckuva a basketball
player. Just remember the name: LeBron James … I once heard a fan tell
Rocky Colavito he stunk. That wasn’t nice at all. The Rock was a good
person and he deserved better than that. … I hear through the grapevine
that the baseball players will strike in 1994, and they will cancel the
World Series. I certainly hope it doesn’t come to that, although with
the rampant use of performance enhancing drugs, the downsizing of the
strike zone, the hardening of bats and the shrinking of ballparks, I
would not be a bit surprised if we have some sort of offensive
explosion in the game after the players return … Tennessee has three
syllables in it. I always thought it had four. … I disagree with
Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I’m afraid of spiders.</p>

This blog of utterly unrelated things is dedicated to the late, great Hal the Referee.</p></blockquote>

		<span id="comment-73528666-content"><p>SEK:  I had no idea you were anything more than a Mets fan when it comes to what you call Beisbol.</p>

<p>As a Kansas City-to-Chicago transplant, I remain a profoundly loyal KC Royals fan.  That means I check out the <i>Kansas City Star</i> regularly for news on the latest heartbreaking loss, savior prospect (i.e. Alex Gordon), or cheapskate ownership move (sans Gil Meche).</p>

<p>But this also means I have the regular pleasure of reading Posnanski&#39;s columns.  I&#39;ve sent him a number of e-mails over the years filled with compliment after compliment on his columns.  He makes KC sports less of a Keystone Kops adventure. [BTW: If you&#39;re a football fan, Jason Whitlock&#39;s columns are also worth your time.]</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m glad we share this affinity for Joe&#39;s work. And enjoy Beltran while can, or at least until another large market team steals/picks off another quality KC player (i.e. Johnny Daman, Jermaine Dye, Jeff Suppan). - TL</p></span>

		<span id="comment-73575188-content"><p>Sorry to have not responded sooner, but as you can see from the four posts above—which would&#39;ve been spaced over many hours, had TypePad not sputtered—I&#39;ve spent the afternoon brainstorming.  That said, yes, I&#39;m a true <em>béisbol</em> fan, so I can&#39;t help but love Posnanski.  His enthusiasm for the game comes through in every word he writes.  I particularly like his penchant for inventing indexes.  He&#39;s the Borges of baseball writers, creating elaborate evaluative systems left and right.  That said, let me offer my condolences on the current state of the Royals.  I think that with Dayton Moore at the helm, you&#39;re in good hands.  The Meche signing looked awful at first, but now, not so much.  Gordon may&#39;ve been promoted too soon, but you know what?  So was José José José, and he struggled his first few seasons ... but now boasts an OBP over .400.  The future looks good in KC.  As for Beltran ever leaving <em>Los Mets</em>, I have my doubts.  As you can tell from my references to <em>béisbol</em>, I love the new look of the team.  I wager Omar does too.  So long as Beltran&#39;s quad stabilizes, I think he&#39;ll be a Met until he&#39;s useless.</p>

<p>I do feel sorry for small market teams, however.  Then again, KC&#39;s not quite as small market as it seems.  If Gordon&#39;s another Brett, I&#39;ve no doubt the city will flock to <em>my</em> stadium to watch your boys in blue.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-73924398-content"><p>I just saw the comment from Jane L.: Gray &amp; Company.  Man the hucksters will find every potential sale, yes?  Wow.</p>

<p>On the Royals, well, Gordon is coming around.  His BA is up to .235/.240 or so after hanging around .185 for a LONG time.  I&#39;d like to see some power, but you can&#39;t have everything.</p>

<p>The KC Star just ran an evaluation of the Beltran trade.  The Royals got a starting catcher (J. Buck) and right fielder (M. Teahan) out of it, so the writers feel it was/is a qualified success.</p>

<p>I saw that the Mets want the White Sox&#39;s Jose Contreras.  I think Omar M. wants to rebuild those 1990s Cuban nationals teams.  How&#39;s Glavine doing these days?  Oh, and Omar can keep his dirty mits off one of the star players for my second fav. team, the Cubs.  You&#39;re not getting Carlos Zambrano.  The Mets have already had the only Zambrano they&#39;ll ever have.  Hands off Z! - TL</p></span>

People keep telling me this. It must be true. So I beg of you, please immediately forward the following email to everyone in your address book: Dear My Dear Friends, You must understand that I would not send this email unless I had good reason, and as you have known me for a very long time you know I am not someone who sends emails like this without good reason. My good reason today is my friend I met over The Internet who has a name and it is Acephalous. He is a nice boy who had cancer and got hit by a car but now he has no head and it is very serious and it does not look like he will make it without YOUR HELP. Bill Gates who is a GREAT MAN sent him an email and in it he wrote that if ONE MILLION people clicked on the site of Acephalous that he would buy him a new head made of computers and parts so he can live a good life again. So please click on THIS LINK as hard as you can and pray all the time every day and then forward this email to everyone in your address book and maybe you can help a suffering young little child to have a new computer parts head to replace the one he lost to cancer and being hit by the car and pain.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/thought-in-pr-3.html"><span><strong>Thought-in-Process: Wharton's &quot;The Descent of Man,&quot; Part I</strong> Indicative of my current juvenile acuity: while reading a discussion of male homosexuality in Victorian culture I laughed aloud when I encountered the name of the person whose work had been cited: Dr. Harry Cocks. I initially thought it a prank of some sort, but as you can see from the link, that's the man's name. His work seems high quality, but when I read his name, I snorted like a seventh grader. (For which I apologize.) Needless to say, I'm not in an intellectual place today. So, I'm borrowing a page from my friend Wally's book and begin this post by saying: No idea where this is going. Edith Wharton's &quot;The Descent of Man&quot; (from the collection of the same name) compels us to consider it in light of the other book entitled The Descent of Man, written by Charles Darwin. It won't surprise you to learn that there's no shortage of irony in the title. Parsing that irony is no mean task, but such is my aim. (The page numbers refer to those found on the page linked above. Haven't checked whether they actually match those in Scribner's.) The story opens with Professor Linyard returning from a holiday on which he has &quot;eloped with an idea&quot; (313). Eloping is a most grievous sins in a society in which matches are made with an eye toward improvement. It suggests something illicit has occurred, and Wharton's language backs this up: As the express train whirled him away from the somewhat inelastic circle of Mrs. Linyard's affections, his idea seemed to be sitting opposite him, and their eyes met every moment or two in a glance of joyous complicity; yet when a friend of the family presently joined him and began to talk about college matters, the idea slipped out of sight in a flash, and the Professor would have had no difficulty in proving that he was alone. (313) The playfulness aside, metaphorical eloping stirs similar feelings of impropriety in Dr. Linyard as actual, otherwise he wouldn't air his anxious little fantasy—not even or, perhaps, especially to himself. The time he vacationed alone (but for his idea) he describes in explicitly romantic language: There, during the long cool August days, lying full length on the pine-needles and gazing up into the sky, he would meet the eyes of his companion bending over him like a nearer heaven. (313) Does the story's title reflect upon the intersection of Darwin's theories of sexual selection (discussed at length in The Descent of Man) and the society in which such romantic narratives play out? Linyard, after all, is discussing the desirability of his idea as a companion. His interest in his own domestic affairs is similarly informed by the evolutionarily-influenced sociological theory: He took as it were a sociological view of his case, and modestly regarded himself as a brick in that foundation on which the state is supposed to rest. Perhaps if Mrs. Linyard had cared about entomology, or had taken sides in...</span></a></div>
