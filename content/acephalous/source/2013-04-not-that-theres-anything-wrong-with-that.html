In one post, she took a moment between praising one thing and another to note that I am 99.999999999% certain to be gay. And since I&#39;m not (not that there&#39;s anything wrong with being gay) I have no idea where she got that idea, except perhaps just my &quot;open-minded&quot; attitude towards GLBT issues when they came up in class? </p>

<p>Still haven&#39;t gotten around to commenting my amusement: I want to do it in Korean and catch the student off guard, but I&#39;m not sure I want to do so badly enough to bother with registering for the portal site I&#39;d have to join to do so...   </p></span>

It was hilarious (to me, anyways), because the lead singer is singing about how he got a crush on this really cool girl from class, then sees that&#39;s she&#39;s wearing a pink triangle and it can never be.  But in a later interview ... which I looked up because the whole thing seemed amusing ... he tells the interviewer that this really happened, and he talked to the girl a year later or something, and found out that she was actually heterosexual and was wearing the triangle to show support.  So if he hadn&#39;t been a twit who couldn&#39;t talk to the objects of his desire and treat them like real people, he might have found that out and had an actual relationship with her.</p>

<p>Anyways, if some of your students think of you as their inspirational gay teacher... a lot of the inspirational &quot;relationships&quot; inside people&#39;s heads are not with real people who they ever talk to.  And with that, and only barely related, here&#39;s a couple of stanzas of a poem which can be sung to Weezer&#39;s song&#39;s tune:</p>

<p>Pink Triangle </p>

<p>When I&#39;m filled with what I&#39;ve heard<br />
I start looking around for words<br />
Time to pay poetic rent<br />
Maybe I&#39;ll read <i>The New Sentence</i><br />
But when I start to feel that pull<br />
I&#39;m just pulling off myself<br />
My inspiration&#39;s left unsaid<br />
Though she lives inside my head</p>

<p>My muse is a lesbian<br />
Arrangements didn&#39;t go like they should<br />
She and I are married in my mind<br />
But poems in my mind are no good</p>

<p>At least we can still be friends<br />
Though she&#39;ll sit down and pretend<br />
Wishing she had Patti Smith<br />
But muses don&#39;t choose who they&#39;re with<br />
When we&#39;re feeling bad and down<br />
Then we&#39;ll laugh and joke around<br />
Sometimes she&#39;ll smile and touch my hand<br />
It&#39;s all that she can really stand</p>

<p>My muse is a lesbian<br />
My poetry is always third-rate<br />
Every poem that I like is queer<br />
Why can I only write them straight?</p></span>

So much of the rhetoric about homosexuality focuses on whether God made homosexuals gay or whether they’ve turned their back on the Lord by succumbing to learned perversions. The distinct sexualities of the Collins twins seem a boon to those who think homosexuals are etymological perverts: Jason has “turned aside” from the righteous path that is his birthright. Why did he do so? He was converted by childhood trauma or an agenda-driven homosexual into thinking his feelings for other men were normal; which is to say he “turned with” an individual who convinced him that other men were as attractive as women. God didn’t put the gay in him — someone abused it into him. Whether that abuse is sexual or rhetorical in nature matters less than the simple fact that it’s abuse. That it’s become socially acceptable for prime-time faggots to queer the very foundation of marriage is a sign that American culture’s in steep decline. Children are being converted into perverts — are turning with those who would turn them aside — and political correctness prevents decent people from objecting to this abuse. But all this talk of conversion and perversion obscures the fact that homosexuals haven’t always had their agenda implemented as precisely as a Zionist plot. Homosexuals were once considered a diaspora of narcissists who wandered the world looking for themselves. They were inverts. They’d “turned inward” and demanded of others the love the mirror denied them. Which is only to say that the operative metaphor changed. What was once thought to be a loathsome inversion of God’s love has become what happens to children when they watch Glee. Because when you introduce contemporary American culture into the classic conversion narrative you end up with a system of dissemination indistinguishable from infection. You don’t need to convince someone to “turn with” you if society’s “putting in” or “doing to” them what the homosexual agenda wants it to. Which is why conservatives express their concerns about Collins’s revelation by not caring with thunder. So long as they ignore its importance the epidemic can be contained. They want Collins to become a non-story. Hence the significance of the fact that Jason Collins has an identical twin brother who’s straight. The temptation to use Jarron Collins’s heterosexuality as proof that Jason was either converted to or infected by homosexuality will prove too great. That Jarron shares Jason’s DNA but not his perversion demonstrates once and for all that God doesn’t sanction the birth of gay babies. Jason couldn’t have been born this way because Jarron was too and look at him. Which means homosexuality is essentially a function of bad parenting: parents either didn’t pay enough attention to who tended to or played with their children or they allowed...</span></a></div>

EXTRA! FEMINISM DEBUNKED! RAPE NOT REAL!</strong> What are we going to do with all you lying bitches? Here we are generously giving you privileges you don’t deserve, and one of you pulls this shit? I just don’t—what else can I say? We tried. We tried to make you rational. We pretended not to ignore your vaginas and needs and civil rights and you repay us by having one of yours fake rape? Don’t you realize this discredits everyone who shares your junk? Christ—that’s it. I’ve had enough. Feminism is officially cancelled. Shut the fuck up. I don’t want to hear it. You don’t have the right to complain anymore. You could’ve stopped this one woman from fabricating this one rape but you didn’t. And I don’t want to hear about all the other rapes that are real or go unreported because I don’t. I don’t want to hear about them. This woman lied about a rape threat! Just imagine what the person she invented is going through right now. His fictional parents are crying great heavy tears at this false accusation against the son they never had. If he already didn’t exist he’d be wishing he never had. So that’s it feminists. If you can’t rally in defense of men who were never born then I just can’t fathom what you’re good for.</span></a></div>
