We spent the eight years through January 19, 2009, listening to Democrats complain that President Bush had purportedly caused a constitutional crisis by issuing signing statements when he signed bills into law. Democrats and Arlen Specter (now a Democrat) complained that these unenforceable, non-binding expressions of the executive’s interpretation of the laws Bush was signing were a usurpation Congress’s power to enact legislation.

Democrats, he argues, were correct when they complained that signing statements were “unenforceable, non-binding expressions of the executive’s interpretation of the laws [and] a usurpation Congress’s power to enact legislation.” They were right to complain when the Bush administration appended them to legislation, but now they must defend the very principles conservatives have never had and stop President Obama from appending anything to H.R. 3590 when he signs it into law or be branded rank hypocrites.

McCarthy throws his hands in the air and again complains to the umpire, who again approaches the mound. “How is he supposed to hit a 95 m.p.h. fastball?” “Not very well, actually, is the idea” the pitcher replies. “I don’t want to see the gun touch anything over 80 from now on, we clear?” “You want me to throw batting practice fastballs?” “I don’t want you to, I’m telling you to,” the umpire says as he makes his way back to the plate. Needless to say, by the time the liberals record three outs, the Yankees are up by twenty-seven. In the dugout, the liberals notice that the grounds crew is not only relocating the mound 50 ft. from home plate, but raising it five inches; moreover, the Yankees’s starting pitcher is heading to the mound with a jar of Vaseline and an industrial sander.

			<p>Over on <em>The Corner</em>, Andy McCarthy unwittingly <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YjFiNGRiZmFiY2NjYTMzNGFiMDQ2NjIxZTc3ZTg4ODU=">claims</a>
 that Democrats are morally superior to Republicans:</p>
<blockquote><p>I know we tire of the hypocrisy, but I really think this 
is remarkable. We spent the eight years through January 19, 2009, 
listening to Democrats complain that President Bush had purportedly 
caused a constitutional crisis by issuing signing statements when he 
signed bills into law. Democrats and Arlen Specter (now a Democrat) 
complained that these unenforceable, non-binding expressions of the 
executive’s interpretation of the laws Bush was signing were a 
usurpation Congress’s power to enact legislation. But now Democrats are
 going to abide not a mere signing statement but an executive order that
 purports to have the effect of legislation—in fact, has the effect of 
nullifying legislation that Congress is simultaneously enacting?</p></blockquote>
<p>Democrats, he argues, were correct when they complained that signing 
statements were “unenforceable, non-binding expressions of the 
executive’s interpretation of the laws [and] a usurpation Congress’s 
power to enact legislation.” They were right to complain when the Bush 
administration appended them to legislation, but now they must defend <em>the
 very principles conservatives have never had</em> and stop President 
Obama from appending anything to H.R. 3590 when he signs it into law or be branded rank hypocrites. Consider this in baseball terms:</p>
<p><span id="more-6295"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>It’s the top of the first, and McCarthy and likeminded 
conservatives—we’ll call them the Yankees—stride to the plate with a <a href="http://thecollegebaseballblog.com/2008/10/01/checking-in-on-reeboks-vector-o-bat/">Reebok
 Vector O</a>. When the liberal pitcher complains, the umpire merely 
shrugs his shoulders and shouts, “Play ball!”</p>
<p>The pitcher opens with a wicked 12 to 6 curve over the heart of the 
plate. McCarthy stares at the mound in disbelief, then turns and says 
something to the umpire, who walks to the mound and informs the pitcher 
that there will be no more quote, bendy pitches, unquote.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You heard me,” the umpire replies. “McCarthy can’t hit anything but
 four-seamers, so that’s what you need to throw.”</p>
<p>Dumbfounded, the pitcher steps on the rubber and launches a 95 m.p.h.
 four-seamer down the chute. McCarthy throws his hands in the air and 
again complains to the umpire, who again approaches the mound.</p>
<p>“How is he supposed to hit a 95 m.p.h. fastball?”</p>
<p>“Not very well, actually, is the idea” the pitcher replies.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to see the gun touch anything over 80 from now on, we 
clear?”</p>
<p>“You want me to throw batting practice fastballs?”</p>
<p>“I don’t <em>want</em> you to, I’m <em>telling you</em> to,” the 
umpire says as he makes his way back to the plate.</p>
<p>Needless to say, by the time the liberals record three outs, the 
Yankees are up by twenty-seven. In the dugout, the liberals notice that
 the grounds crew is not only relocating the mound 50 ft. from 
home plate, but raising it five inches; moreover, the Yankees’s starting 
pitcher is heading to the mound with a jar of Vaseline and an industrial
 sander. When they complain, the Yankees insist that this this 
non-regulation mound is actually regulation, and that they’re not 
doctoring balls so much as fulfilling their original intent.</p>
<p>The liberals return to the dugout, grab a Reebok Vector O and angrily
 approach the batter’s box. When McCarthy sees the bat, he dashes home 
and pulls the umpire aside. They confer, and after a moment, the umpire
 tells the liberals that their aluminum monstrosity violates the spirit 
of the game. When they complain that the Yankees used them, McCarthy 
smiles and says, “But you’re supposed to be better than that.”</p>
<p>“Let me get this straight,” the liberals respond. “You want us to 
throw batting-practice fastballs, off a regulation mound, to batters 
holding rocket launchers while we’re in the field; but when we come to 
the plate, you expect us to hit doctored balls thrown off a spiked 
Little League mound with wooden bats, or you’re gonna call us 
hypocrites?”</p>
<p>“Pretty much.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Were McCarthy and his fellow conservatives intellectually honest, 
they wouldn’t complain when the other side cheats too, <em>but insist on
 everyone playing by the same rules</em>, no matter what those rules may
 be.</p>

It doesn&#39;t negate anything in the bill, or exempt the Presidency from it&#39;s requirements: it specifically and clearly explains how the bill will be implemented so that its most objectionable components <i>will</i> be carried out to the satisfaction of the visigoths who claim Democratic membership. </p>

<p>So, not only are they ethically vacuous, they&#39;re illiterate.</p></span>

That said, Ahistoricality, you&#39;re absolutely correct: using signing statements to reassure people that extant law will be honored is entirely different from using them to make new law.  I wish I could&#39;ve worked that into the analogy, but honestly, if that were any more about baseball, I think readers would revolt.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a968c675970b-content"><p>Nice baseball story Scott; I too am reminded that the season is close at hand.  But, I think that your premise is mistaken.</p>

<p>McCarthy has not decided that signing are all wrong, but is merely pointing out that Obama and the national level Democrates, who spent a lot of time decrying the use of such devices, were quick and too happy to do so when it suited their purpose.  And you know as well as I do that no signing statements and few executive orders would be upheld by the courts over legislation passed by congress.</p>

<p>There are good elements to this bill, of that I&#39;ll freely admit.  But on the whole it&#39;s more about moving towards a system where equality of outcome is guaranteed instead of equality of opportunity.  That&#39;s a recipe for mediocrity regardless of how noble the intent.  Already there are MSM doctors such as ABC&#39;s Timothy Johnson who is saying, &quot;that we&#39;ll have to stop demanding the latest of everything just because we think it&#39;s the best&quot;; or that doctors need to be paid based on the outcome of treatment instead of for services rendered.  Why didn&#39;t we hear any of these arguments during the healthcare debate?</p>

<p>I think all he&#39;s saying is that <i>tu quoque</i> is a poor excuse for hypocritical actions, and he&#39;s right.  Integrity is about living the moral code that you espouse, regardless of personal interest, and Obama&#39;s useless executive order utilized for cheap political purposes is antithetical to that virtue.</p>

<p>So we&#39;ll have to agree to disagree on this one.  Still, best of luck to your Mets this season.  I root for the Dodgers, so there&#39;s really no conflict of interest there until pennant time!  And I share your contempt for the Yankees, having lived in DC and suffered the owner imposed mediocrity that is the Orioles for too many years, but, you know, have to keep my mouth shut out of deference to my lovely wife; who is a native New Yorker and rabid lifelong Yankees fan.</p></span>

<p>Are the fact that many more people will be put into a system where 1/3 of the practitioner have said they will cease to practice not lead to a more mediocre system; especially when we will be expected to settle for less than we can get now?</p>

<p>Am I wrong about what constitutes integrity?</p>

<p>Am I wrong to say that among our founding premises is equality of opportunity, as opposed to equality of outcome?  And isn&#39;t that what madame Pelosi said is among thethings that this bill guaranteed in her glowing pre-vote endorsement?</p>

<p>Where have I engaged in falsehoods?  And, Rich, where have I said that I want &quot;people to die&quot;?</p>

<p>Underprivileged folks currently qualify for Medicaid, the elderly subscribe to Medicare-which we&#39;ve been told will have half a trillion dollars siphoned off of it (which I&#39;ll believe when I see).  Currently, no one is turned away from emergency rooms for treatment; in fact only 17% of those recieving emergency care have no insurance.  And the Hippocatic oath that Doctors all take compel them to treat the ill and injured.</p>

<p>The members of the House of Representatives, &quot;the peoples house&quot;, that voted for this, in opposition to their constituents will, should be ashamed of themselves.  And those like Mr. Stupak, who claimed cover through Obama&#39;s promise of an executive order that he has yet to sign, should be doubly ashamed; both for their willful disregard of their Constitutional responsibilty as well as for being duped.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not getting the hatred and vitriol inherent in your criticism; not to mention imputing bad intent into my own opinions.  I thought that tolerance and diversity were watchwords of your shared ideology.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I bear you all no animosity.</p></span>

<p>Look at his last-but-one comment.  It has:</p>

<p>* Fantasies about 1/3 of doctors Going Galt;<br />
* &quot;we will be expected to settle for less than we can get now&quot;-- Note who the implicit &quot;we&quot; is.  Poor people don&#39;t even exist in Reed&#39;s world.<br />
* He still equates &quot;everyone getting health care&quot; to &quot;equality of outcome&quot;.  What an evil twit.  Whatever you think about equality of outcome in terms of income, say, most non-sociopaths don&#39;t look at a sick person and say &quot;Well, we could get medical care for them, but that would be equality of outcome.  Wouldn&#39;t want them to get the same care as someone who has a lot of money.&quot;<br />
* He&#39;s clueless about poor people and their lives, of course.  For instance, most of southern Chicago has no nearby emergency room.  <br />
* He&#39;s unable to use simple human empathy.  For instance, does he go to an emergency room whenever he needs a simple checkup?  No?  Why not?  How often does he think he&#39;d go if that was the only place he could go?</p>

<p>And no, tolerance and diversity don&#39;t mean what he thinks they mean.  I don&#39;t look at a room full of people who have never killed anyone and think &quot;Hey, we need some murderers in here!  We won&#39;t be diverse without them! I&#39;m really ready to tolerate their disregard for human life, and their willingness to kill somebody if that makes them richer!&quot;</p>

<p>What people like Reed need to hear is that they&#39;re scum.  Because that&#39;s what they are.  They come out a political movement that has battened on racism, and now is trying to use homophobia.  They succeeded in barbarically bringing back torture as something that a supposedly civilized people could defend.  Their incoherence and greed is so strong that they can prattle about equality of outcome and never think about what it actually means when the outcome is whether people get sick and die or not.</p>

<p>But people like Reed are here because Scott thinks they can be convinced by rational argument, or something.  Just like Obama figured that all he really had to do was talk nicely to the GOP and they&#39;d work together for the good of the country.</p></span>

The medical care I get now includes very expensive medications.  My present insurance has a &quot;deal&quot; with the drug companies that cuts the coust by $3000.00 no one picks up the remaining cost and I still have to pay my portion.  So now I take about 20 pills each day and get infusion treatment each month.  I worry that the &quot;New Rules&quot; can decide that I should stop getting the care I now recieve and I fear that.  I can afford treatments that others can not.  Is that fair? No.  Everyone should be able to receive medical care and changes need to take place.  I am not sure the present changes will answer the need of all.  I just know I wwould like to be around when my other children marry.  I would like to see grandchildren growing up. I want to remain active.  Now The goverment will tell me what I can have in life.  Be careful what you wish for; it might not be what you really need.</p></span>

The moral core in the middle of yours is &quot;Everyone should be able to receive medical care and changes need to take place&quot;, not &quot;among our founding premises is equality of opportunity, as opposed to equality of outcome&quot;.</p>

<p>At the same time, though, it really isn&#39;t true that the government is going to stop people from getting expensive medical care.  That really is just a lie, made up by the people who wanted to stop health care reform by any means possible.  No one is going to stop you from paying for whatever medical care you want to pay for.</p>

<p>Also, the only reason that people who currently have expensive insurance have insurance at all is because of previous efforts by the same people who are bringing health care reform this time.   If your current insurance could drop you, they would.  The New Rules are really just an extension of the slightly older rules that we&#39;ve fought for politically that keep older people from being denied any insurance at all.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a971de63970b-content"><p>Well, the transition from seeming engagement to mockery is recent, and perhaps not sharp-edged.  But as I&#39;ve also said before, wingers now don&#39;t really work as targets of mockery either.  A target of mockery has to be powerful for it to work.  Sure, right-bloggers were never powerful, but they were once stand-ins and amplifiers for people who had actual political power.  Now?  Now it&#39;s like jeering at the junkie strung out on the corner, mumbling feeble threats at passersby.  Sure, he&#39;s mumbling feeble threats, and therefore is a bad person who would do bad things if he could.  But mostly he&#39;s just pathetic.</p>

<p>The whole recent fight against health care really had nothing to do with wingers at all.  Sure, the press was eager to play up their tiny Tea Parties.  But because the GOP was a unified No bloc anyways, all the important political fights, between people who had the actual power to influence events, were within the Democratic party.   The GOP has no power whatsoever at this point beyond whatever power Democrats choose to give them.  (I&#39;m including things like &quot;not making them actually filibuster&quot; in that category.)  They don&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>Sure, they could take power again, and if they do, mockery of their ridiculous beliefs might once again be kind of funny.  But it&#39;s the humor of weakness, really.  It&#39;s the kind of thing where you laugh because you can&#39;t do anything else.  In a sane world, you wouldn&#39;t laugh at them any more than you&#39;d be driven to seek out and laugh at Flat Earthers.  You&#39;d just sort of sigh and go on and do something else.</p></span>

Are you really so needy that there's no death you won't use as an excuse to call attention to yourself? Although this comment belongs to the tedious category of &quot;complaints about bloggers having blogs and writing about stuff on them,&quot; it nevertheless struck a chord: first, because the size of the community grieving for Alex Chilton surprised me; and second, it seems to be a dangerous time to be a living artist or academic who changed my life. That said, this annoying anonymous person is reading in bad faith: not everyone who influenced me did so greatly or uniquely, which is why I noted Kurt Vonnegut's passing in passing, as a &quot;Vonnegut phase&quot; is required to join the community of readers. The same cannot be said of those academics and artists with whom I shared an intimate relationship over many years, which is why I wrote individual remembrances of Octavia Butler, David Foster Wallace, Howard Zinn, or Alex Chilton. If I seem to be too familiar a type, blame central casting: academics play the part because that's the part they've been asked to play. That there seems to be a wider community of similarly interested intellectuals is, to my mind, a sign that while academic disciplines may be irrevocably balkanized, something resembling a larger intellectual culture still exists. Whether this cultural homogeneity is a good thing depends on what it actually contains, and given how surprising Chilton's inclusion image was to me, I probably should refrain from saying much more about it. However, in light of the recent proliferation of lists like this, I think I'll take a moment to silence future scolds by listing all living authors, musicians, and filmmakers with whose work I feel a deeply irrational kinship. They may not still move me as they once did, but they once did and when they die a little bit of me will too.

He honestly believes that because some people on the left are sexist or racist, everyone on the right is morally superior despite, you know, supporting policies designed to protect the interests of white males. In this case, his ire is raised by a New York Post article about the casting call for the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean movie: The filmmakers sent out a casting call last week seeking “beautiful female fit models. Must be 5ft7in-5ft8in, size 4 or 6, no bigger or smaller. Age 18-25. Must have a lean dancer body. Must have real breasts. Do not submit if you have implants.” And they warn that there’ll be a “show and tell” day. To make sure LA talent scouts don’t get caught in a “booby trap,” potential lassies will have to undergo a Hollywood-style jiggle-your-jugs test and jog for judges. Nolte is outraged on behalf of surgically-enhanced women everywhere: This isn’t some sleazy porn peddler in the valley doing this, this is…Disney. DISNEY is going to subject and exploit young women desperate to be stars to the indignity of a booby ”show and tell.” DISNEY is going to have them jog in place for producers and casting agents in order to keep score of the bounciness of their breasts. Not only is this a case of discrimination against women whose only crime was undergoing a dangerous surgical procedure in order to enhance their appeal to sexists like Nolte, it involves a particularly dehumanizing &quot;booby 'show and tell'&quot; in which woman will be asked to &quot;jog in place for producers and casting agents in order to keep score of the bounciness of their breasts.&quot; How does he know this? It says so right in the actual, unexpurgated casting call: Must be 5'7-5'8, Size four or six - no bigger or smaller. Age 18 to 25. Must have a lean dancer body. Must have real breasts. Do not submit if you have implants. This is a show and tell of costumes with the director and the producers. Plan on an entire day of trying on clothes and being photographed. Sticklers might insist that the prepositional phrase &quot;of costumes&quot; modifies &quot;show and tell,&quot; and that there's nothing in the casting call about actresses being asked to &quot;jog in place&quot; so producers and casting can &quot;keep score of the bounciness of their breasts.&quot; Since it's not in the casting call, where did this idea of a &quot;booby 'show and tell'&quot; in which a parade of topless women jiggle only what the good Lord gave them come from? Where else? The imagination of John Nolte. The man can't even defend hypothetical women without undressing them in his mind. This...</span></a></div>
