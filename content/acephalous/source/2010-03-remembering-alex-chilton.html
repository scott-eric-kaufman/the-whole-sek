        <meta name="description" content="Like most of my contemporaries, I came to admire Alex Chilton through his professional admirers; and like everyone who came of age before the Internet, what I knew about him consisted of a host of believable rumors. I've never tried to verify those rumors, though, because it was their believability that mattered more than their truth. For example, Alex Chilton indirectly named one of the most important albums of the 1990s via the resilience of a particular lyrical gesture: the sincerely feigned grand statement. On &quot;September Gurls,&quot; he sings: I loved you, well, never mind. I've been crying, all the time. That &quot;never mind&quot; alerts us to the fact that the narrator is a liar, albeit a sympathetic one, because if he were actually that nonchalant he wouldn't be &quot;crying all the time.&quot; Paul Westerberg picks up on the gesture on the aptly titled &quot;Never mind,&quot; in which he sings: It makes no sense, to apologize. The words, I thought, I brought, I left behind, So, never mind. All over but the shouting, just a waste of time. Never mind. Westerberg's delivery on the second line is ambiguously clipped: he sounds like someone on the verge of tears, but the reason for them could be that he has no idea what to say; that he knows that no matter what he says, it won't be enough; that he knew what to say, that he had the right words, but that he's forgotten them; or many an other et cetera. More important for our purposes is what Westerberg learned from Chilton, i.e. how to turn an explicit denial of any significance into an implicit statement of maximal importance. What looks like boilerplate passive-aggression on paper is, in &quot;Never mind,&quot; nothing of the sort: Westerberg shouts &quot;never mind&quot; like an interrupted stutterer, out of sheer frustration over his inability to articulate what he means. The result is that, as in &quot;September Gurls,&quot; the words intended to divest a situation of emotional import acquire the very significance their existence is intended to diminish. Which, of course, is why Kurt Cobain named Nirvana's second album after that Mats track and penned this: I found it hard, it's hard to find. Oh well, whatever, never mind. That lyric reads like a canned slacker response to adversity, and maybe it is; but in &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; the phrase appears a powerful song, so even absent any solid evidence that Cobain's citing Westerberg citing Chilton, I could believe he was. Such was the legend of Alex Chilton in 1991—a full year before Fantasy Records reissued #1 Record and Radio City, meaning that this is what I thought on the strength of the lyrics on the Bangles' cover of &quot;September Gurls&quot; and his work with the Box Tops. I had absolutely no idea what Big Star would sound like, only that Chilton was a force worth reckoning with. And so he was.

Which, when you think about it, is fairly incredible: when I was in high school, I was one of five people I knew who were into Big Star. There must be some powerful process of self-selection at work here, is all I can say.</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01310fc5bf7a970c-content"><p>Gordsellar is probably right.  I know I discovered Big Star only after hearing This Moral Coil&#39;s covers of &quot;Holocaust&quot; and &quot;Kangaroo.&quot;  That&#39;s when I realized what The Replacements&#39; &quot;Alex Chilton&quot; was about, connected the dots, and ran out to buy *Third/Sister Lovers*.  That LP was clearly one of the missing links between The Velvet Underground and punk and later &quot;indie rock,&quot; much like The Modern Lovers LP, the Stooges, Bowie, Can, and Eno.  </p>

<p>So it&#39;s only when that sort of music broke big that Big Star could have the effect they were destined to have (&#39;tho I think the first two LPs were actually pretty successful).  Big Star&#39;s power-pop is a clear reference point for Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe, Squeeze, The Cars, and a good deal of New Wave music; while *Third* is a key influence behind twee and slacker rock.  </p>

<p>In any case, while I had no hopes that Chilton would ever again do much of anything, this was a sad loss.  (And yes, I do see the deaths of others as prime opportunities to talk about myself.)</p></span>

<p><em>I know I first heard &quot;September Gurls&quot; as covered by Yo La Tengo. </em></p>

<p>Absolutely, covers have everything to do with it.  (Although you heard the Yo La Tengo before the Bangles?  God, but I&#39;m getting old.)</p>

<p>You shame me, Ray.  The first album I bought was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_Tiger" rel="nofollow"><em>The Thin Red Line</em></a>.  Gah.</p>

<p><em>Chilton had three careers, and the transition from his first (sixteen-year-old emitting a seasoned blue-eyed-soul baritone) to his second (Lennon-and-McCartney&#39;s damaged lovechild) was especially startling.</em></p>

<p>What was the third?  Drunken desolation spent in strumming in seedy bars?  Or his late &#39;90s tour with the Posies, in which they mostly played Big Star songs?  I think of him as having two careers, then a long, sad something-or-other.</p></span>

<p>The first LP I bought was a 99-cent cutout of &quot;The Great Lost Kinks Album,&quot; all of which I also still listen to. It&#39;s not your fault, though; I lucked out and the mid-1970s just happened to be the golden age of cut-out LPs as the 1960s was the golden age of 45s and the &#39;00s was the golden age of downloads.</p></span>

<p>I remember a great period where I wouldn&#39;t buy anything new and would only have to wait a couple of weeks for turn-around copies of new releases make their way back through.  I picked up all of the import-only Belle &amp; Sebastian EPs at $4 a pop before they were reissued.</p>

<p>I bought the &quot;#1 Record/Radio City&quot; reissue used over amazon, I believe.  I take it this is the place to advance my controversial thesis that &quot;September Gurls&quot; deserves to be in every jukebox in the country, along with the Pixies&#39; &quot;Here Comes Your Man.&quot;  Of course, said jukebox really also ought to include &quot;Thirteen&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of El Goodo.&quot;  You can fill in the rest with whatever you want.  Except it has it include some Al Green.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/03/deep-creep.html"><span><strong>Deem creep!</strong> The noise from the right about the constitutionality of “deeming” beggars description. Consider Limbaugh: If [House Democrats] pass this using the Slaughter solution—in other words, literally shredding the Constitution. I decline to comment on his claim that passing this bill by “deeming” it passed will literally cause someone to walk into the National Archives and ribbon the Constitution, because the point of Limbaugh’s literal metaphor is plain enough: if the majority of the House votes to “deem” the Senate version of the bill passed, Democrats would have skirted the Constitutional requirement that, to become a law, a bill must “have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate” as “determined by Yeas and Nays,” i.e. a simple majority. How would the Democrats have accomplished this dastardly unconstitutional deed? By a House vote on November 7, 2009, in which 220 Yeas passed H.R. 3962 over the objection of 215 Nays, followed by a Senate vote on December 24, 2009, in which 60 Yeas passed H.R. 3590 over the objection of 39 Nays. These votes were both constitutionally kosher; however, the House now plans to undermine democracy by “deeming” H.R. 3590 passed not by a floor vote “determined by Yeas and Nays,” but by a floor vote “determined by Yeas and Nays.” The Democrats expect the American people to accept the unconstitutional results of a House vote in which members of the House vote to determine whether a bill should or should not be passed. The Democrats are determining the Rules of House proceedings, a practice the Constitution explicitly outlaws, in Article 1, Section 5: “Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings.” I understand why conservatives are outraged: In order to defeat a parliamentary procedure not mentioned in the Constitution—the threatened Senate filibuster—House Democrats are exercising a right granted to them by the Constitution—the right to self-determine the Rules of their Proceedings—by voting in the manner the Constitution demands—a simple majority. Moreover, they’re doing so without passing the bill, because even if more representatives vote to “deem” H.R. 3590 passed, that merely means that a simple majority voted “Yea” on the question of whether H.R. 3590 should be passed. A vote to pass H.R. 3590 is, as all loyal Americans know, not the same thing as a vote in favor of a bill that “ensur[es] an up or down vote” to pass H.R. 3590. Why? Because bypassing a direct vote on the bill allows Democrats to convince other Democrats to vote for health care reform now and claim a little distance from it in the midterm elections. Why do House Democrats need that distance? Because they know that Republicans are chomping at the bit to attack any and everyone who votes for health care reform, and they know that the tactics the Republicans will use will be dishonest. In the final tally, then: because they know that the next election will be all about death panels and the coming socialism, and because they know that Senate Republicans are determined to...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/03/an-annoying-anonymous-person-writes-why-is-it-any-time-anyone-hipsters-or-academics-are-supposed-to-like-dies.html"><span><strong>A list of people whose deaths I have permission to mourn.</strong> An annoying anonymous person writes: Why is it any time anyone hipsters or academics are supposed to like dies, they just so happen to be very important never-before-mentioned influences on your life? Are you really so needy that there's no death you won't use as an excuse to call attention to yourself? Although this comment belongs to the tedious category of &quot;complaints about bloggers having blogs and writing about stuff on them,&quot; it nevertheless struck a chord: first, because the size of the community grieving for Alex Chilton surprised me; and second, it seems to be a dangerous time to be a living artist or academic who changed my life. That said, this annoying anonymous person is reading in bad faith: not everyone who influenced me did so greatly or uniquely, which is why I noted Kurt Vonnegut's passing in passing, as a &quot;Vonnegut phase&quot; is required to join the community of readers. The same cannot be said of those academics and artists with whom I shared an intimate relationship over many years, which is why I wrote individual remembrances of Octavia Butler, David Foster Wallace, Howard Zinn, or Alex Chilton. If I seem to be too familiar a type, blame central casting: academics play the part because that's the part they've been asked to play. That there seems to be a wider community of similarly interested intellectuals is, to my mind, a sign that while academic disciplines may be irrevocably balkanized, something resembling a larger intellectual culture still exists. Whether this cultural homogeneity is a good thing depends on what it actually contains, and given how surprising Chilton's inclusion image was to me, I probably should refrain from saying much more about it. However, in light of the recent proliferation of lists like this, I think I'll take a moment to silence future scolds by listing all living authors, musicians, and filmmakers with whose work I feel a deeply irrational kinship. They may not still move me as they once did, but they once did and when they die a little bit of me will too.
