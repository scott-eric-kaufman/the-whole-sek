I want that furrow further worn with embarassing enthusiams. How do I propose to accomplish this? With gushing odes to objects and ideas which under normal circumstances don't warrant odes. As the title &quot;Odeman Extraordinaire&quot; appeals to my inflated sense of self-importance, and I figure at the rate of an ode a week I can earn it in less time than it takes most people to purchase a badly battered 1993 Chevy Corsica. (Recent experience indicates such a purchase requires more time than anyone considers reasonable.) Tonight I present the first installment of the Tuesday Ode, which I call &quot;Ode to a Faux-Tee&quot;: A face from nought, I dispatch this fool beard, From chin and cheeks I shade, altering measure; On jaw Norelco chopped at four, on chops it sheared At three. Forsooth admit this tonsure Chills a soul to Kelvin's absolute. But being that attractiveness to all Depends upon the trimmed, not hirsute mug Of one swashbuckling and &quot;cute,&quot; My &quot;shavéd&quot; face, displayed as at The Mall, Wears its whiskers like a thug. Oh for face of Pitt! or one which would Be coo'ed emetic never -the, nor -any -less, I offer booty, tho' be it understood All piratanical, but I digress. Oh that my jaw had animate jut, like Wayne, Of bone composed, mandibular success! This chin, my chin, recessed unto the pain; Unless expert manscape, causes stress. That I might strut and feel so masculine, I trim this faux-tee to a manly maximum.</span></a></div>
