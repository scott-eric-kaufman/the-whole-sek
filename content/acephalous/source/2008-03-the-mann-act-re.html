			<p>[<em>I meant to post this on <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/">Edge of the American West</a>, but Eric and Ari neglected to give me the admin privileges I so richly deserve, so I'm stuck posting it here.</em>]</p>

<p>According to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, Governor Spitzer will be charged with violating what is popularly called the Mann Act, but which Congress passed as <a href="http://www.pbs.org/unforgivableblackness/knockout/mannact_text.html">the White Slave Traffic Act.</a>&nbsp; It was designed to&nbsp; &quot;regulate interstate commerce and foreign commerce by prohibiting the
transportation therein for immoral purposes of women and girls, and for
other purposes.&quot;&nbsp; That the bill prohibits transportation for &quot;immoral purposes&quot; and &quot;other purposes&quot; is as problematically vague as you suppose.&nbsp; Shortly after its passage, the <em>Virginia Law Review </em>voiced its concern that those phrases grant:</p><blockquote><p>the statute such sweeping comprehensiveness as to include every form of conduct contrary to good order.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Or as the <em>New York Times </em>put it:</p>

<center><span style="font-size: 1.4em;">GIVES WIDE SCOPE <br />TO WHITE SLAVE LAW<br />_____</span></center>

<center><span style="font-size: 0.9em;"><br />Supreme Court Holds That the <br />Act is Not Limited to Com-<br />mercialized Vice.<br /><br />________</span></center>

<center><span style="font-size: 1.2em;"><br />INCLUDES ESCAPADES ALSO</span></center>

<p>The Act not only included escapades, it threatened to criminalize <em>all</em> larks, shenanigans, antics, frolics, capers, flings, and high jinks—at least as practiced by the citizenry.&nbsp; Because the very same ambiguity allowed ideologues in police departments and district attorney offices to prosecute anyone and everyone for anything and everything.&nbsp; The first person arrested under the act, heavy-weight champion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Johnson_%28boxer%29">Jack Johnson</a>, was charged with consorting with his white wife shortly after defeating &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Jeffries">The Great White Hope</a>&quot; in &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Johnson_%28boxer%29#The_.22Fight_of_the_Century.22">The Fight of the Century</a>&quot; in what is most certainly a coincidence.&nbsp; (Also coincidental: the judge who presided over Johnson's case was none other than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenesaw_Mountain_Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a>, who while serving as the commissioner of Major League Baseball, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenesaw_Mountain_Landis#The_baseball_color_line">blocked the sale</a> of teams to owners who would integrate their roster.)</p>

<p>As H.L. Mencken <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19355/19355-h/19355-h.htm">noted</a>, this expansiveness was a feature, not a bug:</p><blockquote><p>It was carried through Congress, over the veto of President
Taft, who discerned its extravagance, on the plea that it was needed to
put down the traffic in prostitutes; it is enforced today against men
who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252" name="Page_252">&nbsp;</a></span>are no more engaged in the traffic in prostitutes than you or I.
Naturally enough, the effect of this extension of its purposes, against
which its author has publicly protested, has been to make it a truly
deadly weapon in the hands of professional Puritans and of denouncers of
delinquency even less honest. &quot;Blackmailers of both sexes have arisen,&quot;
says Mr. Justice McKenna, &quot;using the terrors of the construction now
sanctioned by the [Supreme] Court as a help—indeed, the means—for
their brigandage. The result is grave and should give us pause.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Lest you think Mencken's merely grinding another of his innumerable axes, in 1936 the <em>Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology </em>comforts its readers with this balm salve:</p><blockquote><p>Although many believe the &quot;Mann Act&quot; has become a dead letter through the policy of non-enforcement, a recent statement by J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations, shows that this is not true.&nbsp; He said: &quot;During ... the month of June, 1936, there were more convictions for the violations of the White Slave Traffic Act than in any month during the past three years.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>What does all of this mean for Spitzer?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; Maybe some of you legal types know how the Mann Act works behind the scenes.&nbsp; It obviously could be used to coerce testimony from someone.&nbsp; (The <em>Times </em>didn't dub it &quot;the Encouragement of Blackmail Act&quot; for nothing now.)<br />&nbsp; </p>

Right now, JPool's response to Rich's hypothetical—&quot;think about what you'd have to do to show no connection between Elizabethan architecture and the structure of Shakespeare's plays&quot;—demands your attention: From the Journal of Literary Primatology: Abstract: Under labratory conditions three groups of infinite numbers of monkeys (hereafter, INM) were given a corresponding infinite number of word processors (Hamilton, et al., 2003, having shown definitively that no overall difference in results obtained from the use of word processors rather than typewriters) and allowed sufficient time (ST) to reproduce all of Shakespeare's plays. Group A were raised in a physical environment consisting of nothing but Elizabethan architecture. Group B were raised under normal monkey conditions, but then given intensive exposure to and instruction in the field of Elizabethan architecture. Group C, the control group, were allowed no exposure to Elizabethan or neo-Elizabethan architecture. The three INM groups were monitored in real time, and their literary output, including fragments and drafts, were compared to all of Shakespeare's plays. At the end of ST, no disceranble difference was present in the literary output of each INM grouping. The three grops did produce variations on the plays' known plots and characters. For example, Group A produced a variation on &quot;Othello&quot; in which Desdemona, not actually dead, but only winded and contused, arose at the end of the play, only to kill herself again. Group C, produced a number of versions of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; in which Shylock is indeed awarded a pound of flesh, thoroughly drained of blood, and Antonio walks with a limp for the remainder of the play. In each case, however, the INM grouping also eventually produced the more tradtional versions of the plays and the variations that they produced were not found to correlate meanigfully with their exposure to Elizabethan architecture. Based on INM Simian Modeling Theory, then, no correlation has been found between Elizabethan architecture and Shakespeare's plays.</span></a></div>
