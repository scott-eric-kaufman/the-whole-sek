To begin:</p>

It's difficult to tell exactly where because there's a notched log occupying the majority of the frame. Why the log? Because Will's world is now the size of its notch. His world closes in on him as his death nears, so it makes sense that his purview, visually speaking, follows suit. It momentarily expands into an extreme long shot when he believes he's found an excuse that might could maybe save him:</p>

He's trapped within the structure of the shot, and the medium close-up reminds us of the fear and pain we saw on his face when he was captured:</p>

<p>The irony of being imprisoned on an open field is more apparent in the above because the framing is looser, but it's essentially the same shot as the one in which he confesses his oath-breaking with one important exception: when he confesses to have broken his oath, he knows all hope is lost. In the shot above, the possibility of escape still exists, if not on that field, then possibly through pardon—hence his mentioning the white walkers two frames previous. But by the time he enters that structurally oppressive medium close-up, he knows his fate. </p>
<p>As do the other characters in the scene, and more importantly, the extent to which they sympathize with is indicated by the distance of the camera from their faces. This may seem like a simple means of identifying a complex emotional response, but it has a long history in film theory, the short version of it goes something like this: </p>
<p><a name="1">Films used to be silent</a>. Because actors couldn't tell us what they were thinking and many directors found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertitle" target="_self">intertitles</a> aesthetically unappealing, the close-up on actors' faces became the preferred means of communicating their emotions. The heightened expressiveness evident in the close-up compelled audiences to pay more attention to the micro-expressions written upon the actors' faces, which made directors pay more attention to directing their actors to wear particular micro-expressions to communicate particular emotions, and so began the vicious cycle that led to the conventions of the modern close-up. Also, there's the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_perception" target="_self">we're so hard-wired to pay close attention to faces</a> that we'll "see" the face of Satan in a cloud formation, Saint Mary slumming on some toast, or <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2001/08/28/ast24may_1_resources/pio_med.gif" target="_self">this Martian fellow looking at whatever it is he's looking at</a>. We want to see faces, and when we see them, we want them to communicate something to us. Just <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/finnegan.jpg" target="_self">look at my cat</a>. Can't you see the wonder in his eyes? <em>Of course you can't</em>. Whatever emotion Finnegan's feeling might be the feline equivalent of curiosity, but it's inhuman. Its humanity is merely imputed, drawn on his mug by our brain's intense desire to find meaning in anything structured like a face. </p>
<p>All of which is a long way of saying that conventional close-ups have been building on extant brain architecture for more than a century now, which is why the simple act of reversing from long shots of some characters to close-ups of others will make it seem as if the narrative's being focused through the latter. Let's continue with the scene:</p>

<p>Van Patten's already established Will as a sympathetic character, so the medium close-up suffices to maintain sympathy. But then the camera reverses to:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c623fef970c-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c623fef970c" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00321" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c623fef970c-500wi" alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00321" /></a></p>
<p>An extreme close-up on Bran's face as he listens to Will's sympathetic words. The camera builds on the concern generated for his well-being in <a href="acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/09/game-of-thrones-winter-is-coming-for-catelyn-stark-and-jon-snow.html" target="_self">the previous scene</a> to continue to make his reaction central to the effectiveness of this one. How does Robb Stark feel about Will's death?</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c624034970c-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c624034970c" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00321" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c624034970c-500wi" alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00321" /></a></p>
<p>Not as deeply as his younger brother. The contrast between the extreme close-up on Bran and the medium close-up on Robb makes Robb seem more distant, which is only fitting given that he's seen men executed before and considers it in an impersonal sense, as the responsibility of a lord. What about Theon Greyjoy?</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c624090970c-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c624090970c" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00321" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c624090970c-500wi" alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00321" /></a> </p>
<p>The medium shot indicates that he cares even less than Robb does about Will's fate. (No surprise given what we later learn of his character and commitment to the responsibilities of a lord.) The sequence is impressive because with each edit the character in-frame cares less about Will, which in turn makes the audience care less about each successive character. After a close-up of Will's neck planted in the aforementioned notch and a few more ironic "freeing" extreme long shots, Van Patten turns to Ned, who possesses both Robb's distance, as is becoming of a Lord:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c624a9f970c-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c624a9f970c" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00199" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c624a9f970c-500wi" alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00199" /></a><br />And Bran's proximaty, as is becoming of a <em>good </em>Lord:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee3d7b1a4970d-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee3d7b1a4970d" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00204" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee3d7b1a4970d-500wi" alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00204" /></a><br />Between those two shots, Van Patten briefly cuts to Bran and Jon:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee3d7b276970d-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee3d7b276970d" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Games of thrones - winter is coming00337" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee3d7b276970d-500wi" alt="Games of thrones - winter is coming00337" /></a><br />This medium-very-close-up functions differently from the earlier one of Bran. It still captures the expressiveness in his face, but by backing off just enough to include Jon in the shot, we're able to see not only the expressiveness on his face, but the object of his concern. Just follow his eyes as he says "Don't 'look away." We've seen this <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3209d08f970b-500wi" target="_self">look on his face before</a>, and the tenderness it communicates is clearly setting up what will happen to these two as the season progresses. To reiterate my central point, though, that this scene establishes a continuity of sympathy between Will and Bran, and in doing so the audience and Bran, as Ned executes Will, Van Patten presents us with the following sequence:</p>

He has both obeyed and disobeyed, but done so in a manner that no one but the audience can notice. We've learned something important about his character, about the conflict between the child he still is and his desire to behave like a lord. I don't want to say too much more about that final sequence for fear I'll overdetermine the discussion, but I think there's a lot to be said about the contrasting faces of the three Brans in it: the first nervous, the second slack, the third steeled in a childish and almost pathetic way. So I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p>I hope you've enjoyed this extended tour through five minutes of the first episode of a series I'm teaching in its entirety this quarter. Posts on upcoming episodes will, of necessity, probably only span two posts, but they'll be arriving very soon, because the academic calendar stops for no one.</p>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/09/inside-baseball.html"><span><strong>Inside baseball.</strong> (This is some seriously tedious material. I only wrote it so I wouldn't ever have to write anything about it again. More interesting material also published on 28 September 2012 can found here.) As some of you may remember, back in 2006 myself and others were subjected to a comment and email campaign of unhinged rage from someone who claimed to be a better philosopher than everybody else. Steps were taken, by many, to stop this person. The difference between the steps others took and the ones I did had to do with the fact that he'd threatened my wife's life, on multiple occasions, and lived around the corner from me.* It was not cool. In late 2009 or early 2010 I began to receive similarly unhinged emails from someone claiming to be &quot;Jeff&quot; from &quot;proteinwisdom.com.&quot; I asked this person to stop sending me emails. He did not. After this persisted, instead of repeating the annoying trials of 2006, I simply had a friend, a former grad student with a law degree, send Jeff Goldstein a cease-and-desist letter. I sent it to the address he'd provided me when he wanted me to send him a free book. For the purpose of verification, that address looks like this: 5*** P****** C***** F******** C* 8****. I hope that establishes I sent the letter to the correct place without actually revealing the actual address, as I'm not the sort of person who posts private emails or home addresses or cell-phone numbers on the Internet. (All of which has been done to me, including quite recently by you-know-who.) The vile emails continued for another week or two, then stopped. I assumed that the cease-and-desist letter had taken awhile to arrive but had finally done its job, and given that I didn't want to have anything else to do with Goldstein, I considered the matter settled. I did, however, make a mistake in mentioning that I'd sent this letter to Patrick Frey without explicitly indicating that I'd rather it remain private. And I wanted it remain private with good reason: the harassment had stopped and I didn't want it to resume. For reasons unclear to me, Goldstein claims not have been the one harassing me or the person who stopped harassing me after I sent the letter. That's just a big coincidence. As I have no evidence to the contrary, I suppose I'll just have to take his word for it. There is evidence that someone sent emails to Jeff using my name at this time, and those of you who know me and can recognize my style can judge for yourself whether I wrote this email from an account I don't have.

If it seems a little more basic than the rest of those posts, that’s because it’s the first real day of class and I have to start somewhere.) I have one goal here: to define &quot;high fantasy&quot; as a genre through Fellowship of the Ring. There will no doubt be academic arguments about the particulars—the true extent of Tolkien's influence, for example, or the necessity of orcs—but I want to sketch out the basic generic qualities of high fantasy in a portable manner, i.e. one that will also apply to Game of Thrones. Meaning the most commonly argued generic feature to qualify as unnecessary baggage is this one: Works of fantasy exist in a world utterly unrelated to the one in which we live and are therefore purely escapist. Because, at the very least, whatever work I do with Fellowship also needs to apply to Game of Thrones. That and it's just wrong. Anything written by a human being in a particular historical moment belongs to that particular historical moment even if it depicts a different or invented historical moment. The rest of the generic features of high fantasy I want to pull from Fellowship via an immanent analysis of the film itself, and what better place to begin than with maps? Maps are important because 1) sentences like &quot;Go north until you hit Chicago and hook a left and you'll end up California&quot; don't make intuitive sense in fantastic worlds, and 2) the most common plot elements in fantastic works, quests and wars, are map-driven affairs. You need to know who's where and in relation to what in an invented world, and that requires special attention be paid to maps. Though the visual presentation and manipulation of maps is prevalent in high fantasy—as is evidenced both above, viewing Peter Jackson's zooming around the map of Middle Earth, or in the opening credits of Games of Thrones—it should be noted that as a film convention, it predates high fantasy as a genre. (Spielberg's clearly referencing something here.) Another common element in high fantasy would be a token of power: Like one of those. In the case of Fellowship, the ring functions as both a token and embodiment of power, whereas in Game of Thrones, the Iron Throne will merely be the token awarded to the winner of the game, but in both cases there's an item whose acquisition is certral to the plot. In Fellowship, Jackson establishes and maintains the significance of the ring by constantly zooming in on it. The frame above, for example, belongs to a sustained zoom: But Jackson's always zooming in on the ring. To wit: That's Frodo at The Prancing Pony, but note the difference between the sustained zoom on Sauron's hand and the interrupted zoom on Frodo's fingers. Jackson's taking advantage of our implicit understanding of filmic convention when he zooms in on Sauron's hand: he knows that such zooms are sometimes intended to...</span></a></div>
