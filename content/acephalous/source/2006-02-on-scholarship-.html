<p>As we all know from experiences with Goethe, the only serious way to decide what an author might say now is to make a latex model of the authors head and speaking organs, complete with bellows, and let the author speak for herself.  It works far better if you have access to the room where they were working, but I believe that this process can be fruitfully completed even outside of those kinds of locations.</p>

<p>Barring this kind of intervention, I am always fascinated when people make those kinds of presumptions; I like them because they add a second voice to the author&#39;s corpus.  Since these kinds of presumptions are usually premised on the idea that there is a coherent author who would have intentionally made a particular choice, I read these presumptions with glee: in supplementing the text of the author, they relate one more way in which the voice of the author is split.<br />

<p>John, welcome to Acephalous!  We&#39;re open late <i>every</i> night for <i>your</i> convenience.  I&#39;m a fairweather fan of such glosses, however, since they&#39;re often terrible.  Melville shouldn&#39;t be second-guessed by a third-rate critic (or parodied, as above, by a fourth rate one); that said, there&#39;s something to the notion that critics of the older, single-author-study model would be better equipped to make those kinds of judgments than their contemporary equivalents.  Reading Delbanco&#39;s recent biography of Melville, I realized how much research and, to put it lightly, obsessiveness it takes to be able to ventriloquize an author.  (I feel like I&#39;m almost able to speak for Jack London now, only I can&#39;t because the investment of time and energy I&#39;ve put into acquiring that ability has made me loathe thinking about the man.  There must be something to the &quot;Great Man&quot; theory of literary studies, if only because the habitation of lesser minds makes one want to lose one&#39;s own.)</p></span>

Reading Delbanco&#39;s recent biography of Melville, I realized how much research and, to put it lightly, obsessiveness it takes to be able to ventriloquize an author.&quot;</p>

<p>I agree that those critics would be in a better position to make those claims meaningful, but I wonder if the stakes of such claims have changed.  I am not sure that even an author&#39;s accounts of her own choices are very meaningful to me except insofar as (and this is why intentionalist efforts remain interesting to me) they indicate the desires of the reader which underwrite the &quot;obsessiveness&quot; of reading a text in that mode.</p>

<p>The better equipment of the single-author study is not a more objective view of the author, but rather the willingness to believe that there -is- a unified and coherent author which could be studied.  This belief is something that seems to me (and I have to say that although I am done with my coursework, I feel woefully inadequate in making claims about contemporary academic practice) worn out in the last fifth of the XXth century and only now something which people are starting to fully operate within.</p>

<p>But my belief is probably more representative of what and who I read rather than the actual fact of academic praxis.  But it is fun to have this kind of gap between myself and the text, in which I cannot fully obsess about the text: a gap illustrated by author-oriented critiques which sublimate the gap, a space for the people who really, really believe in the author.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m off, but I think that what &quot;it takes to be able to ventriloquize an author&quot; is not research but quasi-pathological obsession.<br />

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/an_excerpt_from.html"><span><strong>Illegitimate Thusiosity; or, Loosely, I Said, Loosely</strong> An excerpt from a CFP which came across the wire today: Our word religion is adapted from Latin compounds meaning, to reread and to link back. Thus, religion seems inescapably tied to the past. As you rightly suspect, that &quot;thus&quot; bothers me. On what grounds does the etymology of the word alter our perceptions of it? I am more keen than most on etymological trivia, but it seems I'm also more careful than most when I consider its use value. In the sentence above, the author employs the etymology in order to reinforce a fairly common idea: religion invokes a sense of tradition and history for religious folk. Nothing to object to there. But why make on etymological grounds what is better made on historical? One answer is that this pithy deconstruction bears some synecdochal relation to the justification for English scholars studying things outside of books, i.e. a stand in for the entire &quot;linguistic turn .&quot; Since &quot;reality&quot; consists of the words people think and utter and write about it, the purview of the scholar who studies words extends without limit. What can't be reduced to the words people use to cognate them? Nothing! [Were this a dissertation chapter instead of a blog post this would mark the point where I move into a history of deconstruction and discuss how much Derrida's methodology differs from the third and fourth generations of scholars who derfly use it to bludgeon works into smearable pap. Consider this a nod of my head in that general direction born of a strong desire to move along.] In this loosely deconstructive sense, the above &quot;thus&quot; signals an actual attribute of the word &quot;religion,&quot; one which is recognized (if only unconsciously) by anyone who sees the word &quot;religion&quot; waltz across a page. Buried in the simple &quot;thus&quot; is the idea that the words we encounter have histories we can sense without knowing . . . much like that overly nice fellow Chester who lived across the street. The cookies he delivered hot to our front door and the clippers he offered to lend notwithstanding, my geese bumped every time I talked to him . . . almost as if I knew he was convicted serial rapist on the lam even though I didn't. That is the sense in which the etymology of the word &quot;religion&quot; manifests itself to those who don't know it. (What did you think I meant by &quot;loosely&quot;?) But there is a larger problem here, one a rigorous scholar like Derrida never would tripped over: The etymological history of the word &quot;religion&quot; is highly contested. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the meaning cited above (&quot;to re-read&quot;) comes from Cicero's contention that it originated from relegere. Only the more widely accepted etymology is religare (&quot;to bind&quot;). Now ambiguity is the stuff of deconstruction, no doubt, but ambiguity shouldn't ground a &quot;thus&quot; so much as render its thusness suspect. That CFP thus neatly encapsulates an annoying feature of contemporary literary scholarship: exploiting someone else's...</span></a></div>
