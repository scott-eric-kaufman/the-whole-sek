<p>But claiming that Mann is overrated because he is all style and no substance is absurd. Yes, he is all style and no substance, but that is what anyone who rates him high comments on. It&#39;s what he is. You have to claim not that he is overrated, but that the whole vein of film taste that highly values style above all else, or at least finds that pursuit interesting, is overrated. </p>

<p>In fact, that is what so much of this list consists of. &quot;Scorcese makes me uncomfortable with his mean characters driving taxis on his streets while raging, like a bull.&quot; &quot;That ending that is purposely not an ending is not an ending!&quot; </p></span>

You can be pretty sure that someone is foolish and an idiot and clueless when your reaction consists of, &quot;Who is this kid!? He&#39;s a kid! He has no idea what he&#39;s talking about. Just give him a bit more experience and maybe he&#39;ll figure it out.&quot; Then you pause, breath, remember that you are only 23, look up his bio, find out that he is 25. Then you get sad. </p>

<p>Then you actually read his intro, which you had skimmed the first time, and wonder if how any date he&#39;s taken to a movie tolerates the constant drool that likely oozes from his lips onto the woman&#39;s shoulder as he tilts his head to the side and stares mindlessly at the screen. </p>

<p>I write. I want to write. I would love to write a film. I believe writers to be underrated when it comes to a film. Yet I know I am not capable of directing a film. I watch my favorite directors in wonder, amazed at what a brain and sense of art has to do to actually direct a film, to take it beyond a screenplay. BAH! </p></span>

<p>it&#39;s mystifying and nonsensical to read this until you realize that the point is not to name the ten best directors, but to apply the wingnut style to a treasured liberal arts-lover&#39;s trope: the pop culture ten best list.  it also gives shapiro an opportunity to stick his thumb in the eyes of all those hated elites.</p>

In blog terms, you know me as this guy, i.e. the one who caught those students, made that other one extremely uncomfortable, is frequently victimized by the library, hid his cancer from his wife, etc. Those are the stories I tell about myself to explain myself to myself. To quote Gertrude Stein from Everybody's Autobiography: Identity is funny being yourself is funny as you are never yourself to yourself except as you remember yourself and then of course you do not believe yourself. That is really the trouble with an autobiography you do not of course really believe yourself why should you, you know so well so very well that it is not yourself, it could not be yourself because you cannot remember right and if you do remember right it does not sound right and of course it does not sound right because it is not right. You are of course never yourself.The phrase &quot;of course&quot; captures the central irony of all self-fashioning: we know, of course, that we are more than the sum total of the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves, and yet we only understand ourselves, and can only be understood by others, through those stories. In case you ever wanted to know why narrative diversity is important, there you have it: the more narrative modes available, the more possible understandings of themselves the people who encounter them can have. This is self-fashioning at its most mundane, and in terms of Mad Men, this is why Peggy Olson becomes more modern: once she understands herself in terms of the upwardly mobile career-oriented woman, the audience understands her frustrations in terms of the conflict between that meritocratic fantasy and the realities of being a woman in a male-dominated working environment. She becomes more recognizably modern not because the world she inhabits does, but because the way she responds to that changing world elicits a chorus of &quot;of courses.&quot; Neither she nor Peter Campbell become &quot;more real&quot; as the series progresses—fictional characters, being fictional, can only aspire to escape the fictions they inhabit—but as the stories they tell themselves about themselves in order to understand themselves come to resemble ours, they'll seem more realistic because they're telling themselves the same stories we tell ourselves and we, of course, live in the real world. What I meant when I wrote the following, then, is that Campbell is increasingly understanding himself in reference to the same narratives we do, whereas Don Draper is not: Campbell is, in a sense, becoming us, and we revile his behavior to the extent that we recognize our sins in his actions. Draper, however, is becoming art, and as such we hold him as responsible for his actions as we would Emma Bovary. His self-fashioning was not merely based on literary precedent, it was an act of literature, if you will, and...</span></a></div>
