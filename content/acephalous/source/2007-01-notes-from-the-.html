<blockquote><p>Like many academic bloggers, I found myself sitting in
the audience today for the packed “Meet the Bloggers” panel at MLA.&nbsp; I
won’t grumble too much about how [the “Meet the Bloggers&quot;] panel filled

colleagues.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Horace can take comfort in the fact that only one other panel I’ve ever proposed has been accepted—and that conference was in <em>Trieste</em>. 
More to the point, I doubt so many people would’ve attended a panel on
“Evolutionary Theory and Theories of Development in 19th Century
Fiction.” “Meet the Bloggers” held up a mirror to a phenomenon, whereas
my hypothetical panel would’ve only reflected my own narrow range of
interests and attracted far less attention.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Put another way, “<a href="http://www.mclemee.com/">The Press</a>“ may have shown up for Sean McCann, Stephen Schryer and Andrew Hoberek’s panel on <del>C. Wright Mills</del> the New Class in post-WWII literary culture, but as McLemee noted in his <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/01/03/mclemee">most recent column</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>For some topics, 15 people is a lot. Just this morning, for example, I saw <a href="http://side-effects.blogspot.com/2007/01/phenomenological-geography-1.html">a blog post</a> that started by asking, “What is the future of phenomenological geography, and why is this question even important?&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>
The size of the audience is less important than the quality of the
feedback you receive from it.&nbsp; An auditorium guarantees little.&nbsp; Not
that I can complain about the quality of the feedback I’ve received,
mind you, only the quantity.&nbsp; I’ve been stumbling into conversations
about the panel for a couple of days now, but have yet to address half
of what’s been said.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
(For the record, I’m perplexed by how few people are discussing John’s
talk.&nbsp; He called for the radical transformation of the discipline and
insulted everyone with an investment in the current system.&nbsp; Maybe
that’s the problem.&nbsp; Calls for radical transformation and gratuitous
insults seem so, what’s the word, <em>perfunctory</em>?&nbsp; Someone should spread the word: John’s weren’t.)

Below you'll find in situ the corpse of my lively talk. As will quickly become apparent, the word &quot;talk&quot; is no euphemism. I talked a talk. But I almost didn't. Like most panelists, I arrived in Philadelphia toting a paper to be read. Mine concerned the role blogs could play as virtual parlors devoted to the professionalization of sharp minds with rodential social instincts. The first two panels I attended reminded me of my own base nature. The original version of my &quot;talk&quot; betrayed both the conventional insecurities of an MLA panelist—the first-year fear of imposture, father to outbursts profound only in oblivious pretension—and those specific to a graduate student addressing an &quot;unserious&quot; topic. Legitimacy being the motivation behind the panel, why not describe it in a style with impeccable credentials? Why not partake of the inflated rhetoric of the scholar? Two panels into my MLA-crawl, I remembered what my insecurities had obscured: barking fifteen-to-twenty minutes of academic prose may impress the three people in the room who've never encountered it before, but it alienates and infuriates those who have. Those articles written to be read at conferences? They sound like articles, written to be read, at conferences. They are difficult to follow because their content hardly suits their form and the medium flatters neither, the equivalent of a novelization of a film based upon an interpretation of a novel. Novelty aside, who would a book whose front covered declared it to be &quot;based on Huck in Love, the Independent Spirit award-winning adaptation of Leslie Fiedler's seminal analysis of Mark Twain's Huck Finn in Love and Death in the American Novel&quot;? Yet here we are, fidgeting through strings of words and accumulations of arguments best parsed in the privacy of one's own mind. Exceed the limits of the audience's ability to track an argument and a talk will become difficult, yes, but so too does this sentence: Tina told Mark that John thought Pauline knew what Sam had planned for Justine, but Pauline insisted she had no idea John believed that, nor whether the look Justine exchanged wth Mark at work yesterday meant that Tina had inadvertatly revealed Sam's trap before John and his brother Adam could spring it. That sentence could be parsed, but not easily, not on the fly. Perhaps if acceptance packets included an audio edition of The Golden Bowl—or, better yet, Kant's Third Critique—and threats of dire consequences, of career suicide, if they did not become the soundtrack of the initiate's summer, perhaps then we could disentangle complex social relations and order subtle argumentation whilst inadequately-caffeinated in a dimly lit conference hall far from home. Given that academics should be skilled in this mode of communication, the incentive to cultivate such a specialized skill-set is slight. A well-trained audience would solve the problem, but so would a properly trained speaker. All of which...</span></a></div>

If upon mature deliberation you decide the misery of forgiving your underlings for their alarming account of Mr. Kaufman's recent troubles is something you must bear alone, know now that I approve of your fortitude. One of my women once spoke so prematurely. Last word reached our civilized shores, her punishment more than adequately accorded with the severity of her indiscretion. Mr. Chathworth tells me it involved tigers! I titter at the thought of her grisly evisceration! Most Sweet Sinistral, No one had informed me of your doings, either! I informed Mr. Kaufman when first I heard the results of his trial. Had I but known what you knew, we could have spared him much unrest.

We must recompense poor Mr. Kaufman for— Dex, Much as it pains me to say, you must move on. Chathworth is mine. If you cannot accept his choi— Sin, This is not about accepting anyone's decision. This is about telling Mr. Kaufman that a clerical error forced us to write him a most terrible missive, one whose implications we would have foreseen had we but communicated more openly beforehand. We should have examined his medical record and realized that the medication responsible for arousing our suspicions was prescribed by one of our own. He deserves word of his being as robust as the bull-ox your delicate Mr. Chathworth so dotes on ...</span></a></div>
