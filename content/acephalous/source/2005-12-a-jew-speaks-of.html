I&#39;ve exposed you to my poetry on multiple occasions, and what have you said?  &quot;As for your poem, it&#39;s not the sort that&#39;s made me turn my back on contemporary poetry.&quot;  You have to admit, that&#39;s the funniest non-comment ever.  Adam at least told me why one of my poems was a failure.  Hell, even J to the B wrote more when he was hilariously looking through my stuff trying to find things to tear down.  And now you want me to comment on your, what, comic parody poem that was probably written when you were 15?  No.  Not even to say something like due to the ego of poets, any mention of celebrities is absolutely disallowed in poetry unless they are also poets.  Nothing. Zip. Nada.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-12083512-content"><p>Actually, I&#39;ll expand on this, since you clearly don&#39;t know the rules for the stages of amateur poetry reception.  Since Noah gave a list of seven, I will too.  Each succeeding encounter with poetry somehow communicated to the same person moves you up a stage.</p>

<p>1.  Absolute silence.  You do not exist.</p>

<p>2.  Subject quickly changed.</p>

<p>3. &quot;You wrote that, huh?&quot;  Subject quickly changed to either gardening or car repair.</p>

<p>4.  Uncomfortable, accusatory look, as if you&#39;ve just shared Too Much Information, even though your poem wasn&#39;t even personal.  Person walks away without a word.</p>

<p>5.  &quot;Uh, that&#39;s interesting.  Do you have a copy?&quot;  (If you do, it will be heedlessly or nervously crumpled up during the ensuing conversation-change, clearly on its way to the trash bin unread.)</p>

<p>6.  Depending on how well the person knows you, either &quot;Um, your poem really isn&#39;t that good&quot; or &quot;Dude, your poem sucks!  I thought it was really funny how you even could have written that.&quot;  Nirvana!  Someone has actually listened to your poem and said something vaguely apposite about it!  And you want to jump right to this exalted level?  For shame.</p>

<p>7.  &quot;Wow, that really reminds me of some poetry that I wrote once.  I think I was about 15...&quot;</p></span>

<p>1.<br />
2. So ... I understand you came across some people having sex in your office, Scott?<br />
3. You wrote that, huh?  Did I ever tell you about my <i>garden</i>?<br />
4. o o <br />
5. That is indeed interesting.  Do you have a copy?<br />
6. There&#39;s a chance ... just a chance, mind you ... that your poem overplays the &#39;rivers&#39; conceit <i>just a little...</i><br />
7. Wow that really reminds me of a short novel I published once, a sort of inverted <i>Pale Fire</i> with a chunk of SF-y prose followed by selections from a fictional poet&#39;s oevure.  Or &#39;oovr&#39; as my wife puts it.<br />
Man ... <i>those</i> poems sucked ...<br />

		<span id="comment-12103793-content"><p>Excellent, Adam.  I had just been about to comment about how obviously everyone was following the stages and preserving absolute silence.  And if anyone asked why *I* hadn&#39;t remained silent, I&#39;d point out that I&#39;d already been exposed to Scott&#39;s &quot;Oddman Extraordinaire&quot; ode, so I could quickly jump in and change the subject as my stage 2 response.</p>

<p>The only problem with your summary response is that you imply that we should go back to stage 6 at the end.  If only, Adam.  No, no one ever goes back to stage 6.  From there on, each new poem results in yet another stage 7 reminder of the responder&#39;s own poem or story or shopping list.  The only brief moment at which anyone will even laugh at or mock your poetry has come and gone.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-12105190-content"><p>Scott, if all you had to do to have your poetry mocked was to post a mock-worthy poem, people would spend most of their time doing nothing else.  Just imagine looking at one of the many sites like <a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/poems/" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</p>

<p>The picture does change if you become in some way a &quot;professional&quot; or &quot;working&quot; poet.  This can involve anything from being a professor to once having received a $100 city council arts grant to being a circulating spoken word type who lives out of their car and has sold at least 10 $5 chapbooks.  </p>

<p>In this case, no more ad hoc readings for you.  If you are a poet who likes to write things down, you will read your work from behind a lectern, at a library, to a crowd of mostly over-50s people.  In this case your response will invariably be polite applause, and you will never hear your mockery, which will happen as soon as the vicous, giggling fellow poets in the audience (i.e. the audience) get out of earshot from you.  If you are the kind of poet who likes to speak while gesticulating excitedly in front of a mike (or &quot;mic&quot;, as you must always say within your head), you will chant your work from a low stage, at a coffee bar, to a crowd of mostly under-30s people.  In this case your response will invariably be polite applause, followed by vicious, laid-back mockery from the fellow poets in the audience (i.e. the audience) as soon as they have gotten out of cloud of smoke near the door.</p>

<p>In order to solve the problem of this critical mockery shortage, the young rebels in the second group above instituted the poetry slam.  Unfortunately this failed, because the only people who read at them are so extraverted that they are incapable of understanding that they are being mocked.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-12126584-content"><p>Adam, I didn&#39;t even notice that the site had poems by more or less well-known poets.  I took one look at the &quot;new poems&quot; box to the right and shut down my browser very quickly.</p>

<p>Funny, though -- I intended the seven stages and following etc. as a long jape on Scott&#39;s enduring desire to be mocked (what&#39;s up with that? in the next thread, you&#39;re like &quot;Feel free to point and laugh when I fail&quot;), but now that I&#39;ve gotten this far, I realize how true the whole thing is.  I should write it up as &quot;Poetic Reception in America: 2000-2005&quot; and publish it.  In a sociology journal, with survey results and little graphs.  (But that would require pointing out that once you get to the level of, say, someone like Galway Kinnell or Harryette Mullen, the whole thing changes again.  But earnest adulation isn&#39;t as amusing as mockery.)</p>

<p>Anyways, since Adam has run us all the way up to stage 7, I can say that the urge to write off of Langston Hughes is <a href="http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/comments/739/" rel="nofollow">universal</a>.  Doing a purely parodic version of one of his poems as a teen (I&#39;m guessing that 10 years ago Scott was a teen, though I could be wrong) is actually pretty good -- I&#39;ve seen a lot of teen poetry.  See, Scott, you just can&#39;t win.</p></span>

You interrupt their passionate paroxysms. He cries sexual harassment. And wolf. And for his mother. She cries. And cries. And cries. Come Monday, the Sexual Harassment Police call you to &quot;talk&quot; about &quot;the incident.&quot; You are asked to participate in a &quot;fact-finding interview.&quot; You ask the investigator what this about and are informed that its purpose can be discussed it in detail on Friday. An hour later, you send the investigator an email asking for more information and the response contains nothing but a link to your employer's sexual harassment policy. On Wednesday you call the Sexual Harassment Police to confirm the time of your &quot;fact-finding interview.&quot; The person who answers the phone informs you that your &quot;hearing&quot; will occur on Friday at 10:00 AM. &quot;My hearing?!?&quot; you interrobang. Only polite-like because you're from the South and in the South one interrobangs politely. Given this sequence of events, would you suppose that the student had followed through with his threat to file a sexual harassment complaint against you? The patently spoiled student swore a blood oath. The investigator stonewalled you. The secretary sprung a hearing on you. Things had spun out of control. So you don't sleep well . . . and when you muster some winks you dream about tar and torn down-pillows. You imagine yourself covered in the first feathering of countless young birds and everyone (denuded fowl included) points and laughs at you. You wake from these dreams dripping sweat and craving chicken. (You are determined to give those stripped striplings the what-for they so richly deserve.) So you wouldn't sleep that much. You would occupy the couch and watch terrible movies while your wife slept soundly in the bedroom. You would fear the hounds this indulged undergraduate loosed upon you. You would fear the investigator who refused to divulge details. You would fear your shadow and inadvertently damn New England to another six bitter winter weeks. Don't deny it. You would . . . . . . and in doing so you would involve yourself in the monumental misunderstanding that has been my life for the more than a week now. Today I have been thoroughly detenebrated. (Not defenestrated. In this house only cats are defenestrated. And only by other cats. And in good fun. Except for the defenestrated feline. Who was fine.) I have seen the errors of my cynical ways because today I learned that sometimes people are not out to destroy all I hold dear with hot tar and serious plumage. Turns out no one filed a complaint. Turns out the Sexual Harassment Police wondered whether I wanted to file one. Why couldn't the investigator have told me this over the phone last week? Why all the cryptic comments about coming in to discuss it? Apparently that's protocol in sexual harassment cases. The investigator prefers to question faces over voices. The investigator also cannot fathom how I would think a...</span></a></div>

What would that be? A week in which you only think about your work instead of reading and writing about it? Some vacation. People think the academic life akin to the fine Southern tradition of sipping spirits on the long porch as the sun sets. Not quite. Between the moment I submit my grades and January 6th I will: Read every available article written by the panelists whose talks I will attend at the MLA so that when I work up the nerve to ask a question they won't assume they're being punk'd. Attend the MLA. Schmooze. Punk Michael Bérubé. Polish a nearly complete dissertation chapter on Silas Weir Mitchell and his evolutionarily-informed account of the Revolutionary War and its aftermath. Begin researching a dissertation chapter either on 1) utopianism and evolutionary thought in which I revisit the classic critical works about utopian thinking and smack 'em around for their social Darwinian assumptions or 2) race and evolutionary thought in popular literature and academic sociology. Shut it. There is logic there. Edit a manuscript I've been itching to read since it arrived but had to put aside because there are only so many hours in a day and my students had purchase on most of them. Learn Adobe InDesign. Create a template for the Valve's publishing venture. Begin bothering people to edit their contributions. Read for pleasure. Just kidding. Spend time with friends and family whose Christmas gifts have been purchased online and are being mailed to my parents' house in Houston. Inform parents not to open Amazon boxes which arrive lest they ruin Christmas for terminal orphans the world over. Blog. Blog. Blog. I'm not complaining. I love this life and couldn't imagine living another. My days and nights are spent thinking supremely deep thoughts about singularly important stuff. What more could I want out of life?</span></a></div>
