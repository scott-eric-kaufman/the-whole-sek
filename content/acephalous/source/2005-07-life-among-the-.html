They will recognize, in both, the hostility that they and theirs have (admittedly) earned. But it still reads hostile, and it's still likely to be ignored. Consider an example: Sean and Timothy are Generals in the War Against Theory. All available intelligence points to a battalion of Bhabhatistas hiding in the Deconstructed Zone. On the eve of battle, General McCann delivers a rousing condemnation of the Bhabhatistas. General Burke follows suit. The troops, intoxicated by the rhetoric, grab their gear and prepare for the assault. Sounds about right to me. But what would happen if Covert Operative McCann delivered that same condemnation to Bhabhatistas he bunks with?

<p>&quot;Forget about the Bhabha!&quot; he whispers with a vehemence belying volume.&nbsp; &quot;The Bhabha lied.&nbsp; Logic is real...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The Logic is The Real?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; McCann mumbles.&nbsp; &quot;Logic is <em>real</em>.&nbsp; As in 'it exists.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I see, I see.&nbsp; It 'exists.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not 'it &quot;exists.&quot;'&nbsp; C'mon on now!&quot;&nbsp; Then patiently.&nbsp; &quot;Look at me.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; No fingers.&nbsp; It.&nbsp; Ex.&nbsp; Ists.&nbsp; It.&nbsp; Ex.&nbsp; Iists.&nbsp; It.&nbsp; Ex.&nbsp; Ists.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot;&nbsp; Then hushed: &quot;Not 'The Real'!&nbsp; Logic<em>.&nbsp; </em>Lo-gic<em>.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is the Logic<em>&nbsp;</em>like candy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&nbsp; It is.&nbsp; Exactly like candy.&nbsp; So you'll defect?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose.&nbsp; But wait!&nbsp; You said 'the Bhabha lied'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right.&nbsp; I said 'the Bhabha lied.'&nbsp; Now get some sleep.&nbsp; We have a lot to talk about in the morning.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>From that point forward, C.O. McCann would tell him how the Bhabha denied the logic, but how his Che--the Derrida--did not.&nbsp; He would tell him about the logic and put to lie the lies of The Real.&nbsp; And that's pretty much what Covert Op. Y.T. did in his contribution.&nbsp; </p>

		<span id="comment-7403069-content"><p>The line between in-house and external criticisms is probably real. </p>

<p>Taking all this stuff deadly seriously is something one feels called to do as a professional academic. But it might not make for great &#39;blogging&#39;. </p>

<p>Another reason for the widely dispersed structure of our debate is that our source text, Theory&#39;s Empire, is so full of wide-ranging arguments on such a large array of thinkers -- you have to be familiar with everyone from Plato to Eve Sedgwick--  that it&#39;s difficult (or simply mistaken) to diagnose our problems unidimensionally. In literary studies, neat stories about the thralldom of Foucault in 1982 are only a tiny component of the story. Before that you would have to talk about Northrop Frye&#39;s intoxication with Blake, I.A. Richards&#39; worship of T.S. Eliot, or for that matter, the legacy of theological hermeneutics in the field as a whole. French theory didn&#39;t wholly transform Anglo-American literary studies, but rather preyed on certain existing patterns of thought (the vulnerability to &quot;influence&quot;) and radically inhabited them. </p>

<p>To loosely invoke Hillis Miller (&quot;The Critic as Host&quot;), it&#39;s a bit of a question of whether the host (Anglo-American lit crit) or the parasite (french theory) dominates. In answering it, blood may be drawn, but it&#39;s quite possible it will be our own blood! <br />

		<span id="comment-7566273-content"><p>I agree with DeLong (no, really!)  More precision and examples are needed; this debate has been beaten to death for ten+ years already, and will never escape the meta without more precise interventions.  You know, the kind where people actually are forced to read something CLOSELY, and pay attention to the text.  Which was, incidentally, not unrelated to Adam&#39;s point about reading the whole thing.</p>

<p>So thank you, Brad, for just repeating one of Adam&#39;s points.  That said, good luck applying the idealistic methodology and pop-faith of economic theory to literary studies.       </p></span>

Perry's 1873 review of &quot;American Novels&quot; in The North American Review. Of course, given the context of the occurance, I'm not entirely sure it's the first: We have often wondered that the people who raise the outcry for the &quot;Great American Novel&quot; did not see that, so far from being of any assistance to our fellow-countryman who is trying to win fame by writing fiction, they have rather stood in his way by setting up before him a false aim for his art, and by giving the critical reader a defective standard by which to judge his work. (366) Who are &quot;the people who raise the outcry for the 'Great American Novel'&quot;? According to an anonymous critic writing in The Aldine (also in 1873), they are Those who, since the days of Cooper, Irving, Hawthorne, the lamented Theodore Winthrop, and the publication of Mrs. Stowe's famous story, have been impatiently waiting for &quot;the great American novel,&quot; without knowing exactly what they want or expect. (188) This anonymous reviewer assures &quot;them&quot; that &quot;they may indulge in fresh hope since there are indications that, in the fullness of time, it will be forthcoming&quot; (ibid.). So &quot;they&quot; have waited well-nigh 70 years for a novel whose defining characteristics &quot;they&quot; can't fathom. But it will, &quot;they&quot; declaim, be American. &quot;There is an American nature,&quot; Perry insisted, but &quot;then there is human nature underlying it, and to that the novel must be true before anything else&quot; (366). So the great American novel must first be &quot;great&quot; before it should even worry about it being &quot;American.&quot; That sounds like a reasonable enough proposition, unless there's something about being an American that precludes one from writing &quot;great&quot; literature. (More on that in a moment.) What it manifestly could not be, all the critics writing in 1873 concurred, is an English or French ship sailing under American colors. But these critics also concur on the problem with writing a &quot;great&quot; novel about Americans: American life. As Perry says, &quot;the very uniformity of our social life would offer nothing tempting to the writer, unless, indeed, to the satirist&quot; (374). American English is so comically artless, Perry argues, that any attempt to depict it would sound satirical to educated readers even if it were not intended as such. So Americans can't be allowed to speak like Americans in the Great American Novel, but neither are they to speak like the British; American authors, it seems, are too unfamiliar with British locution to ape it successfully. When they try it sounds satirical. An example from Sylvester Judd's Margaret will prove this point: &quot;This is a fine mineralogical region,&quot; said he, as they entered the spot. &quot;I wish I had a hammer!&quot; &quot;I will get one!&quot; she said. &quot;Let me go for it now!&quot; &quot;You are not in health, you told me, and you do not look very strong....</span></a></div>

So I suppose &quot;Shameless Self-Promotion&quot; must suffice, though I'm not really promoting anything. Nor am I not promoting it shamelessly. But here goes: On this day, July 17th, six years ago, Mr. A. Cephalous and Mrs. Little Womedievalist became Mr. and Mrs. A. Cephalous for the first time. To please the Mr.'s father, they did it a second time a month later. Only Jewishly. (That's right: I've been married for six years and am barely in spitting distance of thirty. What can I say? She's from Mississippi; I'm from Louisiana. We consider ourselves lucky we didn't marry kin.)</span></a></div>
