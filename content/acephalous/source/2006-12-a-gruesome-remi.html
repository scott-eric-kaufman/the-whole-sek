He writes: Ablation is the scientists' fancy word for loss. Down here the mass balance is negative. Ice is supplied to this zone mainly by flow from above, little or not at all by direct precipitation, and whatever does come as direct precipitation is less than the amount annually lost. The loss results from several different processes: wind erosion, surface melting, evaporation (ice does evaporate), underside melting of an ice shelf where it rests on the warmer seawater. Calving off of icebergs. Calving is the scientists' quaint word for that event when a great hunk of ice—as big as a house, or in some cases, as big as a country—tears away from the leading edge of the sheet or glacier and falls thunderously into the sea. (200) The diction of that first sentence seems to signal the coming of something metaphorical. Instead, Quammen describes how ablation whittles away at everything from ice cubes to Antarctica. He demands readers not interpret ablation metaphorically; his tone and diction demand otherwise. For example: Possibly this talk about calving reflects an unspoken sense that the larger ice mass, moving, pulsing, constantly changing its shape, is almost alive. If so the analogy doesn't go far. Icebergs don't suckle or grow. They float away on the sea, melt, break apart, disappear. Wind erosion and evaporation and most of those other ablative processes work on the ice slowly, incrementally. Calving on the other hand is abrupt. A large piece of the whole is there, and then gone.

I learned the woman had died from a fall.&nbsp; A freak accident ... She had slipped on a patch of sidewalk ice, the night before, and hit her head. (201)</p></blockquote><p>When I taught this essay, this was the moment my students thump their desks screaming &quot;<em>CALVING CALVING CALVING THIS WOMAN WAS CALVED FROM QUAMMEN'S LIFE CALVED WE TELL YOU CALVED!</em>&quot;&nbsp; The kids were right to recognize Quammen's manipulation, but they rarely accept its implications.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In denying readers the comfort of metaphor, he creates a series of pregnant juxtapositions, forcing them to make the connections he refuses to.&nbsp; Such connections—illegitimate, irrelevant, and unwarranted—are the definitive experience of the scholarly life.&nbsp; <em>Everything </em>pertains to the dissertation because <em>everything </em>a scholar thinks wends it way back to the dissertation. </p>

<p>This may be why academic blogging reaches a wider audience than I originally assumed: academics have a genuinely unique (if intensely narcissistic) perspective on the world.&nbsp; Every thought that flits through their heads is filtered through some idiosyncratic intellectual project, such that they write everything askew, their words indelibly canted by unspoken assumptions.&nbsp; (Or not.)</p>

<p>In this case, however, Erik Larson's reference to &quot;the rest cure&quot; reminded me that instead of spending my Saturday reading for fun, I should be slaving away on my idiosyncratic intellectual project.&nbsp; </p>

<p>[<em>Portions of this post have appeared on Acephalous before.&nbsp; I'd planned on linking to that post, but found its execution only slightly less shameful than its conception.&nbsp; So I did what any sane person would do and revised a two year-old post.</em>]</p>

In my reading, Keats stages Joshua Reynolds' argument in Seven Discourses on Art: [P]erfect form is produced by leaving out particularities, and retaining only general ideas ... the usual and most dangerous error is on the side of minuteness, and, therefore, I think caution most necessary where most have failed. The general idea constitutes real excellence. All smaller things, however perfect in their way, are to be sacrificed without mercy to the greater. The painter will not inquire what things may be admitted without much censure. He will not think it enough to show that they may be there; he will show that they must be there, that their absence would render his picture maimed and defective. The association of poetry with painting implicit here is, I assure you, a sound one. (Even John Ruskin agreed with Reynolds on this point.) So, too, is the association of Keats and Reynolds: the &quot;Ode&quot; first appeared in the Annals of the Fine Arts, edited by Benjamin Haydon, a close friend of Keats and Reynolds partisan. Not only would Keats have been familiar with Reynolds through the Annals, he would've expected its audience to be. So I've established that the poem's famous parting shot alerts the reader to Reynolds' influence. What of it? Someone like Keats—a keen student of Greek sculpture and pottery—would have known, or been able to guess, the answers to the questions he asks at the close of the first stanza. Had he been asked &quot;What men or gods are these?&quot; (8), he may have responded with any number of contemporaneous theories about the scene depicted on the Portland Vase (pictured right): Consider the treatment the young man advancing from the left, his right hand holding his cloak. Is he clutching it? Is it dangling? All evidence points to the former. The right hand lifting the cloak off the bare stone indicates that the figure had previously been seated beneath the Doric entablature. As anyone who spends countless hours studying Lucian amphorae knows, such positioning—beneath a column, his cloak a prophylactic against the cold, smooth stone—announces the presence of a god or immortal hero. If it be a hero, the cloak upon which he sits represents the mortality he doffed... Keats could have thought and written as much, but had he, the poem would not have achieved its general (philosophically speaking) effect. Keats' coy ignorance convinces readers that answering the questions in lines...</span></a></div>

Upon arrival, the keyboard was conscious but unresponsive. According to an eyewitness, &quot;it tried to write something, but all I could read was 'JFDIL;paq2[39an asd'faPOIJ? NFAOITH$!'&quot; It is currently listed in critical condition. One male resident, identified by multiple witnesses as Scott, reportedly lost access to three of four email addresses in the tragedy. &quot;I'm sorry if you've written and I haven't responded. I'm just an idiot and have no idea what my other passwords are.&quot; Authorities believe the incident may have been the latest in the recent spate of gang violence plaguing the Kaufman household. Although no suspects are currently in custody, a police spokesperson estimated the responsible parties will be identified soon.</span></a></div>
