<p>
In “Fixed Opinions, or The Hinge of History” (later published as <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&amp;product_id=1147"><em>Fixed Ideas</em></a>)
Joan Didion represents the Bush Administration’s justification
for what future generations will call the Giant Mess O’Potamia as
follows:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;I made up my mind,” [Bush] had said in April,
“that Saddam needs to go.” This was one of many curious,
almost petulant statements offered in lieu of actually presenting a
case. <em>I’ve made up my mind, I’ve said in speech after speech, I’ve made myself clear.</em>
The repeated statements became their own reason: “Given all we
have said as a leading world power about the necessity for regime
change in Iraq,” James R. Schlesinger, who is now a member of
Richard Perle’s Defense Policy Board, told The Washington Post in
July, “our credibility would be badly damaged if that regime
change did not take place.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Ouch.&nbsp; Didion goes on to discuss the “fixed ideas”
responsible for those repeated statements, but that’s not where
I’m headed: what I want to do is align academic psychoanalytic
thinkers with the Bush administration because it’s 1)
counter-intuitive, 2) highly inflammatory and 3) in this extremely
limited respect, arguably true.
</p>

<p>For the sake of clarity, I should say that I’m talking about
the citation of prominent psychoanalysts and psychoanalytic thinkers as
authorities and not, for example, scholars who talk about the influence
of Freudian thought on American literature in the ‘50s or
‘60s.&nbsp; The latter scholar points to a historical reality;
the former to an unverifiable, unscientific explanation for human
behavior.&nbsp; But I’m not interested in writing another
anti-psychoanalysis broadside.&nbsp; I want to know why, as Frederick
Crews <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2394">argues</a>,
“the academic humanities” are one of the “three
arenas in which flawed but once modish ideas, secure from the menace of
rigorous testing, can be kept indefinitely in play.”
</p>
<p>Why would otherwise intelligent people persist in straining their
thought through this particular “epistemic sieve”? 
One answer, as Didion says, may be that “repeated statements
become their own reason.” One can easily imagine scholars who
have staked reputations to books and articles founded on psychoanalytic
principles saying “Given all I have said as a leading figure in
this field...” This not only applies to first-order academic
psychoanalysts, i.e. those who cite Freud, Lacan, etc. directly; it
also applies to second-, third- and fourth-order academic
psychoanalysts, i.e those who cite Althusser, Fanon, Butler, etc. 
Logic would seem to dictate that if Freud’s anathema, then so is
Lacan; if Lacan’s anathema, so is Althusser, etc.&nbsp; And if
the investment in what’s been said determines what will be said <em>ad infinitum</em>,
well, you see where I’m headed: the year 7,349 R.D.E., in which
radical academic brains, born in jars and entombed in robotic
exoskeletons, discuss the oedipalization issues raised by the latest
libro-amniotic sensation.&nbsp; “I.N.T. 9017240-94189 clearly
suffers from organic body envy, defined by Freud of the Embodied Era of
Eventual and Inevitable Death as...”
</p>
<p>Now, because this isn’t a broadside, I’m not interested
in flogging the Freudians/Lacanians/etc. for their continued allegiance
to one of the available psychoanalytic methods.&nbsp; I’d rather
estimate the value of the psychoanalysis as a pure analytic--divorced
from Popperian claims to science--one which produces more or less
insightful readings of literary texts.&nbsp; As you can tell, I’m
inclined to say that for all their complexities these psychoanalytic
methods lead to gross oversimplifications of whatever they’re
applied to.&nbsp; Then again, I could be wrong.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
That may be too abstract: What I want to know is whether you think
psychoanalysis produces knowledge about literature or only about
psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic interpretations of literature. 
If it’s the former, I’d want to grade the quality of the
literary knowledge produced.&nbsp; (Before you ask,
“quality” is indeed about as loaded as a word can get
without endangering innocent bystanders.) If it’s the latter,
I’d be indebted to anyone who could justify the value of
perpetuating knowledge about psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic
interpretations of literature.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
If you’d rather discuss a couple of specific essays that use
psychoanalysis in entirely different ways, I could do that too. 
Here are some examples drawn from recent articles on Henry James’
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1190">“The Jolly Corner&quot;</a> (available through Project Muse):
</p>
<p>
1.&nbsp; Eric Savoy’s <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/henry_james_review/v020/20.1savoy.html">“The Queer Subject of ‘The Jolly Corner.’&quot;</a>
Savoy aims to explicate “the psychoanalytic dimensions of Spencer
Brydon’s monstrous other, his prosopopoeia-come-to-life...within
the theories of gender regulation and identity formation advanced by
Sedgwick and Judith Butler. I want to chart a particular intersection
between Sedgwick’s work on homosexual panic and Butler’s
exploration of the melancholia of gender which bears on the figurative
operations of prosopopoeia, the master-trope of haunting that is
crucial in the discursive production of the other in paranoid gothic
texts.” The article concludes with this ringer: “the
allegorical case history of ‘The Jolly Corner’ demonstrates
the strange lucidities of a not-so-jolly coroner when backed into a
not-so-jolly corner.”
</p>
<p>
2.&nbsp; Mark Goble’s <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern_fiction_studies/v050/50.2goble.html">“Delirious Henry James: a Small Boy and New York.&quot;</a>
Goble argues that “in A Small Boy and Others that James wants
desperately to recall--’reckless almost to extravagance’--a
different class of American spectacle, along with the urban modernity
that it inspires. We might say James is after a modernity that is still
at low pitch, still capable of sounding the ‘tone of time,’
like Cornelia herself, and her ‘small sallow carte-de-visite
photographs, faithfully framed but spectrally faded’ (&quot;Crapy
Cornelia” 839). I am interested in how James makes history out of
these artifacts of the modern. A Small Boy and Others seems an ideal
place to begin understanding this particular alchemy, because
James’s fond and lavish reconstruction of ‘old New
York’ seems less an excursion into the past, and more an
excavation of the city’s delirious future.”

3.&nbsp; Shalyn Claggett’s <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/henry_james_review/v026/26.2claggett.html">“Narcissim and the Conditions of Self-knowledge in James’s ‘The Jolly Corner.’&quot;</a>
Claggett contends that “‘The Jolly Corner’ is a
Narcissus narrative with an important difference: Narcissus comprehends
his image and dies; Brydon denies his image and survives. Just before
encountering the image, Brydon realizes the dangerous nature of the
knowledge such a meeting would impart, thinking it ‘would send
him straight about to the window he had left open, and by that window .
. . he saw himself uncontrollably insanely fatally take his way to the
street’ (753). Knowing this, Brydon attempts to avoid his other
self at the last moment, and when he cannot help encountering it, he
denies it to be him as the only possible means of psychic escape. In so
doing, he enables himself to fulfill Narcissus’s alternative fate
of living to a ‘well-ripened age’ (347). But James does
more than offer a complementary version of the Narcissus myth—he
dramatizes the complexities of this dilemma—death or
self-knowledge—as fundamental in the subject’s formation of
a cohesive self.”

		<span id="comment-5996648-content"><p>At the Valve I almost responded to the vehicle of your metaphor rather than to the tenor (with which I agreed).</p>

<p>But those kinds of things coming out of the Bush camp aren&#39;t stupidity. They&#39;re arrogance. Bush and his people recognize that the executive / CinC has enormous freedom of action and that the public is very easy to fool. They&#39;re gamblers who are willing to sacrifice many lives to achieve their goal (though not their own.) And they have very ambitious plans (both militarily and domestically) which amount to completely remaking the world. </p>

<p>These plans are fascist or close enough, but those guys are not dumb or pathological (not disfunctional, I mean). Iraq was a little tougher than they expected, but they&#39;re gamblers and will probably up the ante while beginning a witch hunt for traitors at home.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6023653-content"><p>thank god someone sees the parallel (however elliptic - reimannian?), for better or worse, of bush as a psychoanalyst. briefly: 1 thing though - in humanities as in anything else, authorities (right-by-might, repetition-as-truth) exist in no smaller shadow, even in &#39;rigorously tested&#39; disciplines like natural sciences - humanitization of science. psychoanalysis is simple/simplistic, just the same logic rehashed - what&#39;s difficult though is the rehashing ;^). psychoanalysis (remember freud the neurobiologist) is not void of science (qua popperian denegation) however, if its only saving grace. <br />
