        <meta name="description" content="Grant Morrison went on Kevin Smith’s radio show and, as he dedicates his life to doing, blew your mind with his wholly original interpretation of Alan Moore’s The Killing Joke: No one gets the end, because Batman kills The Joker. [...] That’s why it’s called The Killing Joke. The Joker tells the ‘Killing Joke’ at the end, Batman reaches out and breaks his neck, and that’s why the laughter stops and the light goes out, ’cause that was the last chance at crossing that bridge. And Alan Moore wrote the ultimate Batman/Joker story [because] he finished it. Putting aside the fact that Morrison is the perpetually whining junior party in a feud with Moore, the idea that Moore “finished” the story of Batman and the Joker in The Killing Joke requires you misunderstand not only the structure of the book itself, but of the entirety of Moore’s structurally obsessed early work. Consider, as proof, a single page from Watchmen in which Moore accomplishes in nine panels more than Morrison did in all the pages of his magical masturbatory experiment in narcissism combined. But we need not even go there, because The Killing Joke fundamentally refutes Morrison’s contrarianism: the point is not that the story is “finished” but that it never can be. Even the dialogue circles back on itself: That’s not the Joker, but a substitute with a painted face; the dialogue, however, is the Joker’s. After twenty-three silent panels, we have words. Moore frames The Killing Joke by floating the premise without the punchline in the first non-standard panel in the book, but it’s actually uttered in the last non-standard panel in the book: This is because the books folds in on itself. The conflict between the Batman and the Joker is circular: it begins and ends in a “lunatic asylum,” and the non-diegetic words in that first panel are actually spoken aloud by the Joker in the second. Also significant is that they’re about the place they’re not spoken in, which happens to be the place the Joker will eternally recur inevitably be returned. But it’s not just the Joker whose words are eating their own tail: As demonstrated in the post I linked to earlier, the central panels in Moore’s work at this time are inherently important, and this is the central panel of the fourth page of The Killing Joke. But it’s not just its placement in the structure of the page that’s significant — the structure of the panel itself is. The Batman and the Joker are presented here, center-page, as mirrors images of each other. Their faces are identically shadowed, their hands identically held. The slight perspectival asymmetry chops Batman’s fingers off at the knuckles and introduces a hint of uncertainty into an otherwise impassive panel. The only problem is that that’s not actually the Joker, but the Batman doesn’t know that yet, so he’s delivering an obviously prepared soliloquy in which all the dialogue is doubled: “Perhaps you’ll kill me. Perhaps I’ll kill..." />

			<p>Grant Morrison went on Kevin Smith’s radio show and, as he dedicates his life to doing, <em>blew your mind </em>with his <a href="http://io9.com/grant-morrison-says-alan-moore-secretly-killed-the-joke-1156091439">wholly original interpretation</a> of Alan Moore’s <em>The Killing Joke</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No one gets the end, because Batman kills The Joker. 
[...] That’s why it’s called The Killing Joke. The Joker tells the 
‘Killing Joke’ at the end, Batman reaches out and breaks his neck, and 
that’s why the laughter stops and the light goes out, ’cause that was

ultimate Batman/Joker story [because] he finished it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putting aside the fact that Morrison is <a href="http://comicsbeat.com/the-strange-case-of-grant-morrison-and-alan-moore-as-told-by-grant-morrison/">the perpetually whining junior party</a> in a feud with Moore, the idea that Moore “finished” the story of Batman and the Joker in <em>The Killing Joke </em>requires
 you misunderstand not only the structure of the book itself, but of the
 entirety of Moore’s structurally obsessed early work. Consider, as 
proof, a <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/like-what-i-did-with-the-dark-knight-only-this-time-about-the-fourth-issue-of-watchmenin-making-comics-scott-mccloud-argue.html"><em>single page</em></a> from <em>Watchmen</em> in which Moore accomplishes in nine panels more than Morrison did in all the pages of <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/08/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563892677/diesekoschmar-20">his magical masturbatory experiment in narcissism</a> combined. But we need not even go there, because <em>The Killing Joke </em>fundamentally refutes Morrison’s contrarianism: the point is not that the story is “finished” <em>but that it never can be</em>. Even the dialogue circles back on itself:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/two-guys.jpg"><img alt="" height="517" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/two-guys.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="two guys" width="499" /></a></p>
<p>That’s not the Joker, but a substitute with a painted face; the dialogue, however, <em>is</em> the Joker’s. After twenty-three silent panels, we have words. Moore frames <em>The Killing Joke </em>by floating the premise without the punchline in the first non-standard panel in the book, but it’s actually uttered in the <em>last </em>non-standard panel in the book:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/two-guys-2.jpg"><img alt="" height="140" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/two-guys-2.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="two guys 2" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This is because the books folds in on itself. The conflict between 
the Batman and the Joker is circular: it begins and ends in a “lunatic 
asylum,” and the non-diegetic words in that first panel are actually 
spoken aloud by the Joker in the second. Also significant is that 
they’re about the place they’re not spoken in, which happens to be the 
place the Joker will <del>eternally recur</del> inevitably be returned. But it’s not just the Joker whose words are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros">eating their own tail</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/two-guys-3.jpg"><img alt="" height="782" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/two-guys-3.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="two guys 3" width="500" /><em> </em></a></p>
<p>As demonstrated in the post I linked to earlier, the central panels 
in Moore’s work at this time are inherently important, and this is the 
central panel of the fourth page of <em>The Killing Joke</em>. But it’s 
not just its placement in the structure of the page that’s significant —
 the structure of the panel itself is. The Batman and the Joker are 
presented here, center-page, as mirrors images of each other. Their 
faces are identically shadowed, their hands identically held<em>. </em>The
 slight perspectival asymmetry chops Batman’s fingers off at the 
knuckles and introduces a hint of uncertainty into an otherwise 
impassive panel. The only problem is that that’s not actually the Joker,
 but the Batman doesn’t know that yet, so he’s delivering an obviously 
prepared soliloquy in which all the dialogue is doubled: “Perhaps you’ll
 kill me. Perhaps I’ll kill you.” And it’s doubled in a way that makes 
literary critics swoon: in the service of overcoming a tired binary<em>. </em>The point of all those doublings is singular, because the Batman wants to avoid the inevitable “just once.”</p>
<p><em>Just once</em> he would like what cannot happen to happen, so it’s not without a little irony that this dialogue reappears later:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/two-guys-4.jpg"><img alt="" height="519" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/two-guys-4.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="two guys 4" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><em>Minus the “just once</em>.” Just as the Joker’s words from the 
end of the book are superimposed on the beginning, the Batman’s speech —
 which the Joker’s never heard, because that wasn’t him in Arkham — so 
too are the Batman’s words from the beginning of the book superimposed 
on the end. The absence of “just once” is a self-undermining irony. That
 the caption bubble is a box indicates that they’re not the Batman’s 
thoughts. He’s not thinking about the speech he gave, Moore is 
re-presenting them as an echo. He’s reminding the reader that Batman’s 
trying to escape the cycle of violence, incarceration and escape in 
which the pair are locked. Only they can’t escape each other, because 
they’re damaged in the same way.</p>
<p>This should be a familiar argument to anyone who watched <em>The Dark Knight</em>, but Christopher Nolan castrated the pathos of Moore’s argument. In <em>The Killing Joke</em>, the Joker has a definitive origin that — <em>go figure </em>– mirrors the Batman’s: the accidental deaths of his wife and newborn child <em>break him</em>
 just as the murder of Wayne’s parents broke him. They both had what the
 Joker wants to impose on Gordon when he shoots his daughter Barbara: 
“one bad day” centered around the loss of family members. The whole book
 is a reflection upon the damage done by “one bad day,” and in the end 
it valorizes Gordon for not responding to his bad day by dressing like a
 flying rat or serially poisoning the water supply. But the point is 
that this book is about the relation of past to future, a chance …</p>

<p>– t. Like <em>that</em>. I mean,<em> </em> the final fight takes place in <em>a fun house </em>in
 front of mirrors that distort their respective reflections, which means
 that in that second panel above, they’re not only distorted reflections
 of each other, their reflections are distorted reflections of their 
distorted reflections of each other. (Moore clearly values structure 
over subtlety at this point in his career.) For one to kill the other 
would be a kind of suicide neither are willing to commit.</p>
<p>They’re both the damaged products of “one bad day,” endlessly 
reflected in the fun house mirrors they stand between. That each 
reflection further distorts the other <em><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mirrors+reflecting+mirrors&amp;num=100&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XPgQUr3aBcPD2AXb14GYAg&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=476">into infinity</a> </em>is kind of the point of the book.</p>
<p>The man in the fetish bat costume isn’t any healthier than the clown 
in the purple suit, and the more they interact, the sicker they become. 
Each reflection is a further distortion. Their interlocking stories 
always begin and end the same way, but along the way they inflict a 
little more damage on each other. You’d think one of them would snap 
eventually, but the point of Moore’s exercise is that neither ever will.
 Both responded to their “one bad day” with an excessive commitment to 
the willed necessity of their new identities: they differ from ordinary 
men only in their strength of will.</p>
<p>Morrison’s brilliant and wholly original idea — which has been 
floating around so long it’s been addressed in the introduction of one 
reprint and the conclusion of another — is an ignorant misreading that 
cuts against all the other grains in the book. It only seems plausible 
if you ignore the abundant evidence of its wrongness, including the 
first three panels of the book:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/first-three-killing-joke.jpg"><img alt="" height="257" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/first-three-killing-joke.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="first three killing joke" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>And the last:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/last-three-killing-joke.jpg"><img alt="" height="260" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/last-three-killing-joke.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="last three killing joke" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Which combine in way that summarizes the story of the Batman and the 
Joker: on a dark night and rainy night, the Joker does something the 
police can’t handle. The Batman is required. His headlights in the 
book’s third panel announce his arrival. The Batman subdues the Joker, 
who can then be contained by the police again, hence the sirens 
announcing their arrival in the third-to-last panel of the book.</p>
<p>On a dark and rainy night.</p>
<p>Don’t make me mention that those panels are distorted mirrors of each other.</p>

I followed that IO9 discussion for a little bit -- debates over the minutiae of the final panels, the quality of the rocks and grass in the light reflection that tell us not a whole lot -- but I didn&#39;t get too far with it because that discussion didn&#39;t seem to be getting too far. Someone should have considered how those final panels fit into the work as a whole, like maybe Grant Morrison.</p></span>

I think making it seem more like narration rather than calling attention to an old comic technique is the sort of shift towards the &quot;graphic novel&quot; style typical of this time, similar to the creative use of panel layouts and visual symmetry to take on a more &quot;directorial&quot; style in comics. All this to say it may not be Batman thinking this, but I don&#39;t think the absence of thought bubbles proves it.</p>

<p>Of course, I am biased against this post since I have fallen far out of love with Alan Moore since being blown away by Watchmen in high school. I just never found the idea that Batman belongs among his diseased rogues&#39; gallery all that compelling, nor the repeated attempts to hammer home the duality of their situation. That he manages to effectively visually mirror this message is certainly technically interesting, but does it convey any more meaning than Nolan&#39;s clever directorial tricks in Inception? I don&#39;t think so, but I doubt I will convince someone who saw merit in Neonomicon.</p></span>

Having survived THE ROAD, SEK arrives in Baton Rouge. However, somewhere between California and Louisiana, the AWESOME HISPANIC MOVERS became GIANT ANGRY TATTOOED BELARUSIANS. SEK: You can just put all my worldly possessions in this perfectly normally storage unit on my friend’s property. GIANT ANGRY TATTOOED BELARUSIANS: We cannot do that. SEK: Why not? GIANT ANGRY TATTOOED BELARUSIANS: We do not do that. SEK: !?! GIANT ANGRY TATTOOED BELARUSIANS: Here is what you do, I tell you. You rent U-Haul, we meet in parking lot. You move your stuff to U-Haul, drive to home and costs you only one hundred. SEK: To rent a U-Haul for a day? GIANT ANGRY TATTOOED BELARUSIANS: For us to unload alone. Fifty if you help.

What the fuck is that to you?&quot;</strong> At the Corner, Andrew Johnson thinks it's great news for Hillary that CNN's film division hired Courtney Sexton: After the RNC voted the network from hosting future presidential debates if it follows through on plans to produce a Hillary Clinton documentary, the network’s films division has announced it will bring on film executive Courtney Sexton, who has a long history of working on left-leaning flicks. Deadline details that Sexton’s past works include Al Gore’s climate-change documentary An Inconvenient Truth, as well as 2010’s Climate of Change, which “focused on the efforts of everyday people all over the world who are making a difference in the fight against global warming” ... “Any concerns the Clinton team had are all gone,” RNC communications director Sean Spicer told Politico in an email in reaction to the announcement. “This puts the ‘p’ in ‘puff piece.’” Talk about punting the story. Sexton worked on Deadwood. If we use Johnson and Spicer's deterministic logic, that means we'll soon be seeing a completely different side of Hillary: ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE: BE BRIEFED! HILLARY: BE FUCKED! Or: PRESIDENT OBAMA: Hillary, your presence at the UN Commission on -- HILLARY: I don't drink where I'm the only fucking one with balls.
