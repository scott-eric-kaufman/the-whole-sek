        <meta name="description" content="The Joker, of course, has a theory: But his version, from Alan Moore's The Killing Joke, is only technically correct. Bruce Wayne did have &quot;one bad day,&quot; yes, but it was different from the &quot;one bad day&quot; the Joker had: The difference could be that wives and children can be replaced—for tax purposes, if not in our hearts—whereas birth-parents cannot, but while that's true, that's not the most significant difference. The most significant difference—the one that, despite not knowing the secret identity of the Batman, the Joker deeply understands—is that &quot;one bad day&quot; is far worse when, instead of being told of a death secondhand, you witness it yourself. Hence, his plan: The Joker could have chosen to abduct Barbara Gordon off the street and dump her in the river, but instead he waited until Commissioner Gordon visited her apartment, because he knows that losing someone you love is one thing, but witnessing that person's death causes psychological trauma of a far greater intensity.* In short, without knowing that Bruce Wayne is the Batman or how he came to be the Batman, the Joker knows exactly how to make a Batman: make the victim watch. Lest you think that either the Joker or myself are pushing this argument too far, consider the visual history of the Batman's formative moment. It was first represented in Detective Comics #33: There's almost a duo-specific word-picture relation coursing from the first panel to the next. The text of the first declares that &quot;[t]he boy's eyes are wide with terror and shock,&quot; and the second depicts the boy's eyes, wide with terror and shock. The focus, textually and visually, is on Wayne's eyes. On what he sees. The second, and first fully fleshed out, representation occurs in Batman #47: How significant are the young Wayne's eyes in this panel? They've been isolated from his head and framed with anger. It's not the &quot;one bad day&quot; that changes Wayne into the Batman, because there was &quot;something about young Bruce's eyes [that] made the killer retreat,&quot; and that &quot;something&quot; consisted of a combination of awful accusation and eidetic memory, though even that is not enough to transform the owner of those disembodied eyes into the Batman. (Many a poor soul has witness many a beloved one murdered, after all.) But there is &quot;something&quot; to those eyes, as here they are again in Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli's Batman: Year One: They have, I grant, been shoved back in his head, but they're still isolated in an extreme close-up. Miller and Mazzucchelli follow Batman #47 in having young Bruce's eyes directly address the readers' so that they might see what Joe Chill sees above. Only not. Chill's already fleeing in Year One, so the attention of those eyes is even more focused on something outside or beyond the frame, almost as if Wayne seeks communion through eye-contact with an unseen audience. &quot;You understand why I had to become this,&quot; those eyes seem to plead. But no matter how..." />

<p>Lest you think that either the Joker or myself are pushing this argument too far, consider the visual history of the Batman&#39;s formative moment.&#0160; It was first represented in <em>Detective Comics </em>#33:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e875de661970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Bad day - detective comics 33" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e875de661970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e875de661970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Bad day - detective comics 33" /></a> <br />There&#39;s almost a duo-specific word-picture relation coursing from the first panel to the next.&#0160; The text of the first declares that &quot;[t]he boy&#39;s eyes are wide with terror and shock,&quot; and the second depicts the boy&#39;s eyes, wide with terror and shock.&#0160; The focus, textually and visually, is on Wayne&#39;s eyes.&#0160; On what he sees.&#0160; The second, and first fully fleshed out, representation occurs in <em>Batman </em>#47:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3dd80ce970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Bad day - batman 47 02" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3dd80ce970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3dd80ce970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Bad day - batman 47 02" /></a> <br />How significant are the young Wayne&#39;s eyes in this panel?&#0160; <em>They&#39;ve been isolated from his head and framed with anger</em>.&#0160; It&#39;s not the &quot;one bad day&quot; that changes Wayne into the Batman, because there was &quot;something about young Bruce&#39;s eyes [that] made the killer retreat,&quot; and that &quot;something&quot; consisted of a combination of awful accusation and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory" target="_self">eidetic memory</a>, though even that is not enough to transform the owner of those disembodied eyes into the Batman.&#0160; (Many a poor soul has witness many a beloved one murdered, after all.)&#0160; But there is &quot;something&quot; to those eyes, as here they are again in Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli&#39;s <em>Batman: Year One</em>:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3dd87dd970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Bad day - batman year one 02" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3dd87dd970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3dd87dd970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Bad day - batman year one 02" /></a> <br />They have, I grant, been shoved back in his head, but they&#39;re still isolated in an extreme close-up.&#0160; Miller and Mazzucchelli follow <em>Batman #</em>47 in having young Bruce&#39;s eyes directly address the readers&#39; so that they might see what Joe Chill sees above.&#0160; Only not.&#0160; Chill&#39;s already fleeing in <em>Year One</em>, so the attention of those eyes is even more focused on something outside or beyond the frame, almost as if Wayne seeks communion through eye-contact with an unseen audience.&#0160; &quot;You understand why I had to become this,&quot; those eyes seem to plead.&#0160; But no matter how you interpret that third panel above, it patently belongs to this tradition of believing that &quot;what Wayne was seeing and how he was seeing it&quot; is more important than &quot;what happened to Wayne on his &#39;one bad day&#39;&quot; to the future development of the Batman.**&#0160; While we&#39;re on the subject of his future development:</p>

<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e875e0097970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Bad day - Planetary Batman" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e875e0097970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e875e0097970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Bad day - Planetary Batman" /></a>The eyes in the first panel of the Ellis align with those of the second in everything except what they&#39;re looking at.<em>&#0160;</em>&#0160; As I noted in the post linked above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at that bullet in the bottom panel.&#0160; Look how it hangs there—sans  speed lines—between the whites of young Wayne&#39;s eyes.&#0160; The presence of  [Black, the crumbled figure from the first Ellis panel] suggests that this is no flashback.&#0160; This bullet the child never  saw—could <em>not </em>have seen—frozen in the middle of a locked stare.&#0160; But <em>who</em> is Wayne staring at?&#0160; I put my money on the guy in the [first Ellis panel].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s the look that links the orphaned child to the caped crusader.&#0160; Purely visually, the dark circles around young Wayne&#39;s eyes resemble the mask around those of the older, futuristic one.&#0160; There seems to be a continuity to the representative mode employed when depicting this moment, so it makes sense that when Nolan re-re-re-re-boots the franchise in <em>Batman Begins</em>, he&#39;ll partake of it.&#0160; We start mid-scene, with a close-up on the young Wayne after Joe Chill&#39;s approached:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e60828301970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Batman begins00853" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e60828301970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e60828301970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Batman begins00853" /></a> <br />Note the level of framing here: Nolan&#39;s camera is building sympathy with the young Wayne by shooting him straight on instead of angling down on him.&#0160; Nolan then cuts to:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3dda6f4970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Batman begins00855" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3dda6f4970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3dda6f4970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Batman begins00855" /></a> <br />The level of framing remains the same: this could almost be a first-person point-of-view shot from the young Wayne&#39;s perspective.&#0160; There&#39;s even a hint of a low angle of framing, which makes the gun seem even slightly more menacing—as does unbalanced framing, which indicates where the bullet will be headed, and the<em> extremely </em>shallow depth of field.&#0160; The only item in the shot that&#39;s in focus is the gun, because the foreground and the background are mere inches apart in an almost literal representation of Elizabeth Loftus&#39;s theory of &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_focus" target="_self">weapon focus</a>.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Except</em>!&#0160; Loftus&#39;s theory argues that &quot;the presence of a weapon adversely affects subsequent eyewitness recall performance such that memory for details such as the perpetrator’s facial characteristics and clothing is impaired,&quot; whereas the above demonstrated that &quot;something&quot; in the young Wayne&#39;s eyes allowed him to focus both on the weapon and the facial characteristics of the man wielding it.&#0160; It&#39;s not a superhuman power, but neither is it a sign of the hypertrophied intellect that so many generations of writers have attributed to the Batman ... but it&#39;s more of a superpower than a sign of unparalleled brilliance.&#0160; But I digress, as I was attempting to prove that Nolan belongs to the representational tradition sketched out in this post.&#0160; Here&#39;s the final shot of young Wayne:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e875e2115970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Batman begins00950" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e875e2115970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e875e2115970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Batman begins00950" /></a> <br />I take that back.&#0160; Nolan&#39;s a dogged originalist.&#0160; Flip it around and crop it:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3ddb6e8970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Bad day - batman begins" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3ddb6e8970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3ddb6e8970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Bad day - batman begins" /></a> <br />And it&#39;s a virtual ringer for the first representation of young Wayne&#39;s reaction in <em>Detective Comics </em>33:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e875e24f1970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Bad day - batman begins - detective comics" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e875e24f1970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e875e24f1970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Bad day - batman begins - detective comics" /></a> <br />I&#39;m not sure what to make of this, if only because the tradition Nolan&#39;s bucking is such a powerful and evocative one, but I&#39;ll leave it up to my students to work through this one.</p>
<p>*Which, granted, calls into question why the Joker&#39;s psychological problems run as deep and wide as they do, since he was merely informed of his pregnant wife&#39;s death, but that&#39;s a whole different post entirely.</p>
<p>**This dynamic is even apparent in the draft of this post, which <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/files/bad-day---even-in-the-draft-of-this-post.jpg"><span class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3e2da21970b">looks like this</span></a>.<br /><br /></p>

SEK doesn't know that yet. It is imperative for the reader to read said student's voice like this: SEK walks to the Smart Podium and begins to open the images and videos he will be projecting on the wall during class. MR. HELLO! approaches him. MR. HELLO! HELLOOOO! Will YOOOOU be doing the teaching of THIS writing class today? SEK: I'm the sub. I was told you were expecting me. OTHER STUDENTS: We are. MR. HELLO! I am not INNNN this writing class, I am considering adding a writing class to my portfolio this quarter. May I add THIS writing class? SEK: I'm just the sub. You'd need to ask the teacher. SEK explains course policy about adding this deep into the quarter. MR. HELLO! But I am thinking of adding THIS writing course THIS quarter. SEK: Even if I wanted to, I couldn't add you to this class this quarter, because I'm not the teacher. I'm just the sub. MR. HELLO! But what I DOOOO want to know is, what will I DOOOO in this writing class? SEK politely informs MR. HELLO! of what generally goes on in the composition department. The other students—the ones actually enrolled in the class—begin to fidget. MR HELLO! So what YOOOOU are telling me is that when I add THIS writing class, I will be DOOOOING writing. How much writing will I be DOOOOING in THIS writing class, counting by WORDS. OTHER STUDENTS: At least two thousands words a week. MR HELLO! So what YOOOOU are telling me is that when I add THIS writing class, I will be DOOOOING more writing than it is normal to DOOOO. SEK: I can't add you to this writing class, because I'm just the sub, and it's already a little too late in the quarter to add. MR HELLO! So what YOOOOU are telling is that when I add THIS writing class, I will be— SEK: I can't add you to this class— MR HELLO! But when you DOOOO— SEK checks the clock and sees that it's about a minute after class should've started. SEK: I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you leave. MR HELLO! So what YOOOOU are telling is me is that when I DOOOO return on Monday to add this class, YOOOOU will be adding me to it. SEK: I'm just the sub, and I'm subbing for the course director, but I can assure you, she's not going to let you add this late in the quarter. MR HELLO!

Should be a fun class tomorrow.</span></a></div>
