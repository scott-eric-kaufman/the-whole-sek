I expect to hear the voice of a child whisper &quot;tolle, lege, tolle, lege, tolle, lege, tolle, lege, aut pedicabo ego uos et irrumabo.&quot;* I expect I'll consider that a command given to me by God to open the book and read the first chapter I should come upon.** And I expect that instead of landing on Romans 13 like some African-American Church Fathers,*** I'd land on this passage from Gillian Beer's Darwin's Plots: An aspect of his insistence on congruities, and branchings, was his desire to substantise or substantiate metaphor wherever this could be done. He needs to establish ways in which language may be authenticated by natural order, so that his own discourse and argumentation may be 'naturalised,' and so moved beyond dispute. (49) And instead of finding myself in tears over the fair pear once stolen only to steal, as from Thou, the fairest Pear of all, for I had a store of better...so instead of finding myself doing that I'm counting my blessings that I'll never be numbered among these clowns: Those who teach Judith Butler's work have looked forward to a reader that gathers key parts of her extensive corpus and provides a context in which to understand the major themes and continuities of her eclectic philosophical, psychoanalytic, cultural, and political interventions. Because if I was, I'd be forced to parse this blather... Setting aside for the moment how the media act upon the public, whether, indeed, they have charged themselves with the task of structuring public sentiment and fidelity, it seems crucial to note that a critical relation to government has been severely, though not fully, suspended, and that the &quot;criticism&quot; or, indeed, independence of the media has been compromised in some unprecedented ways. ...when I could've been reading this: We have come in this country to tolerate many such fixed opinions, or national pieties, each with its own baffles of invective and counterinvective, of euphemism and downright misstatement, its own screen that slides into place whenever actual discussion threatens to surface. We have for example allowed American biological research to fall behind that in countries where stem cell programs are not confused with &quot;cloning&quot; and &quot;abortion on demand,&quot; countries in other words where rationality is not held hostage to the posturing of the political process. We have allowed all rhetorical stops to be pulled out on non-issues, for example when the federal appeals court's Ninth Circuit ruled the words &quot;under God&quot; an unconstitutional addition to the Pledge of Allegiance. The Pledge was written in 1892 by a cousin of Edward Bellamy's, Francis Bellamy, a socialist Baptist minister who the year before had been pressured to give up his church because of the socialist thrust of his sermons. The clause &quot;under God&quot; was added in 1954 to distinguish the United States from the atheistic Soviet Union. &quot;Ridiculous&quot; was the word from the White House about the ruling declaring the clause unconstitutional. &quot;Junk justice,&quot; Governor Pataki said. &quot;Just...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/the_just_so_sto.html"><span><strong>The Just So Stories, as Narrated by...</strong> ...Boris Karloff? According to the blurb, Although Boris Karloff is best known in the Unites States for his horror film roles, he was a classically trained actor with a distinguished stage and film career. His voice and articulation are perfect for these tales: soothing and emotive, suspenseful at just the right places. A 6-year-old listener was as captivated as the reviewer... A six-year old &quot;captivated&quot; by Boris Karloff. I think I've seen this one before. And am I the only person having a hard time imagining Karloff as the narrator of the 1966 television version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas! or does this belong in the category of pop-culture trivia everybody else digested long ago? (And before anyone asks, I'm hard at work dissertating. I amazoned--if one can &quot;google,&quot; one can &quot;amazon&quot; and also probably &quot;imdb,&quot; although we'll probably need a new class of phonemes to pronounce that puppy--the Kipling because I'm tired [as are my eyes] of staring at the just-crisp-enough-to-read but blurry-enough-to-suspect-I-need-new-glasses .pdf of the originals in Ladies Home Journal.)</span></a></div>
