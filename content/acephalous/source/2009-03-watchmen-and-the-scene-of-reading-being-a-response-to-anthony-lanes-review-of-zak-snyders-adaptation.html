To belabor the obvious: Watchmen is a book of the 1980s.

Foremost among them, he attributes the flaws of particular characters to the author, as when he chastises Moore: You want to hear Moore’s attempt at urban jeremiad? “This awful city, it screams like an abattoir full of retarded children.” That line from the book may be meant as a punky retread of James Ellroy, but it sounds to me like a writer trying much, much too hard; either way, it makes it directly into the movie, as one of Rorschach’s voice-overs.

<p>To belabor the obvious: <em>Watchmen</em> is a book of the 1980s.

So why fault <em>Watchmen</em> for being insufficiently universal in its appeal? Why insist that a film based on a graphic novel be of the moment the former is produced instead of the one represented in the latter?</p>

<p>Because Lane is an ignorant bigot.*</p>

<p>Not that I want to defend Snyder&#39;s film. As will become apparent, I think the film will fail because it is fundamentally unfilmable. But for someone who complains about the lack of subtlety in film and novel alike, Lane punts some rather obvious points. Foremost among them, he attributes the flaws of particular characters to the author, as when he chastises Moore:</p>

old superhero outfit, rubbery and sharp-eared, locked away in his
basement, presumably for fear of being sued for plagiarism by Bruce
Wayne.</p></blockquote><p>You want to talk about missing the point?&#0160; Because I could keep it up all day.&#0160; Only not about Lane this time: now I want to focus on Snyder.&#0160;&#0160; I&#39;m less concerned with his film than its conceit: that through slavish imitation Moore and Gibbon&#39;s novel can transition from page to screen. The central concern in <em>Watchmen </em>is with the experience of reading comic books.&#0160; The scene of reading is of obvious import: the youth reading <em>Tales of the Black Freighter</em> reminds the reader that the thing in their hands was shaped by an escapist tradition.&#0160; As the world marches to war this kid reads about a marooned mariner who &quot;saves&quot; his home by becoming the thing he sought to save it from.&#0160; Moore interleaves this narrative such that it comments on events outside of it.&#0160; </p><p>That is to say: <em>Tales of the Black Freighter </em>reflects for readers of <em>Watchmen </em>the process by which cultural artifacts acquire meaning in the larger world.&#0160; The message here is quite direct: escapist literature tells us something about the world readers want to escape.&#0160; To wit:</p><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168a4cb32970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Pirate01" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef011168a4cb32970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef011168a4cb32970c-320wi" style="width: 500px; height: 261px;" title="Pirate01" /></a>
 <br /></div><p>While the vendor boats about never retreating from reality, the black youth &quot;retreats&quot; into a narrative which speaks more directly to the situation in the world than any newspaper.&#0160; (<em>Spoilers to follow.</em>)&#0160; While the newspapers track world-historical negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union, <em>Tales of the Black Freighter </em>narrates the story of a man whose good intentions lead to unspeakable horror.&#0160; The mariner&#39;s plight directly parallels that of Ozymandias: therefore readers of <em>Tales from the Black Freighter </em>better understand why the novel ends as it does than &quot;well-informed&quot; citizenry whose reading was limited to Platitudes of State and their daily repetition.&#0160; </p><p>Moore champions the unserious—a category that often encompasses the whole of literature—and does so in a way particular to the medium of comics.&#0160; The average reader cannot follow the narrative complexity of a William Gaddis novel because it depends too heavily on a Jamesian ear for vocal peculiarities.&#0160; But the value of a Gaddis novel is not solely located in the virtuoso performances of its author: the complexity created by the overlapping narratives produces a more Talmudic world.&#0160; No statement exists in isolation.&#0160; Every comment is a commentary on every other comment past and future.&#0160; </p><p>Hence Dr. Manhattan.&#0160; </p><p>(<em>But as this post has gotten prohibitively long, I will save the rest of it for later</em>.)</p>

Lane&#39;s review made me so angry (in its slagging of the book, not the movie) that I forgot that you had linked to it, and so it was a real relief to come back to your site and read your deft takedown.  <i>Far From Heaven</i> was a particularly nice catch.</p>

<p>Not much to add to what you said, but I also love how his review isn&#39;t just aimed at the movie and the book, but at <i>comics in general</i>.  He even cites the Two Comic Books that Grown-Ups Are Allowed to Like (<i>Maus</i> and <i>Persepolis</i>, both excellent) as a prelude to &quot;But actually most comics are stupid in all the ways you&#39;d think.&quot;  You know, <i>film</i>—there&#39;s a genre that almost never lets you down.</p>

<p>(By the way, slight typo: &quot;a critic would denigrated&quot; should probably be &quot;who denigrated&quot;?)</p></span>

<p>This is really weird. Lane is a literary, sophisticated sort of movie critic, yet he writes as though sentences in books are autonomic emissions of the author-function, unlike in movies, where they&#39;re contextualized by speaker and setting. I do think he&#39;s smart enough that if an editor had challenged him on this (as Kael remembers Shawn doing, for matters of diction) he would have seen the lapse...so evidently nobody did.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-150317373-content"><p>The review does serve something like it&#39;s fundamental purpose, though: it tells the reader that those who liked the comic book might well like the movie; those who didn&#39;t get the comic book the first time, should stay away. Those who haven&#39;t read the comic won&#39;t really understand the review, except that Lane didn&#39;t like it -- if they trust his judgement, they&#39;ll stay away; if they don&#39;t, they won&#39;t.</p>

<p>You get the impression that he really didn&#39;t want to write the review, which forced him to read the comic, or at least talk about it as if he&#39;d read more than the publicity materials. I can&#39;t actually tell if he <i>has</i> read the comic. </p></span>

<p>I doubt that.  There&#39;s nothing Anthony Lane loves more than panning a movie.  How else did the same guy get picked to review <i>Transformers</i>, <i>Sex and the City</i>, <i>Star Wars Episode 3</i>, and <i>Speed Racer</i>?  Seriously, the <i>New Yorker</i> thought its readers might be thinking about seeing <i>Speed Racer</i>?  </p>

<p>Sometimes he&#39;s great—and as far as I know all those movies were terrible, as the <i>Watchmen</i> movie probably is—but the underlying current in all the reviews is, &quot;Look what you disgusting slobs are making me watch.  How can you be so tacky?&quot;  As soon as he saw that they made a blockbuster out of a well-regarded superhero comic, I imagine he couldn&#39;t wait to get his hands on it.</p>

<p><i>I can&#39;t actually tell if he has read the comic.</i></p>

<p>I think he read just enough to draw his shallowest impressions from it and move on.</p></span>

<p>One thing I&#39;d add - to give Snyder some credit, he did film an animated version of the Black Freighter as a separate movie, and the special edition DVD of the movie is supposed to interweave the two as intended. I think part of the lesson here is that some things are not necessarily unfilmable as they are very difficult to move through the studio system. </p></span>

<p>&quot;Whether his fellow-Watchmen have true superpowers, as opposed to a pathological bent for fisticuffs, I never quite worked out, but this guy is the real deal.&quot; - not paying attention, the fact that Dr. Manhattan is the only true superpowered being in the world is the damn point.</p>

<p>&quot;President Nixon (Robert Wisden), having used our blue friend to annihilate the Vietcong, wins the Vietnam War and, by 1985—the era in which the bulk of the tale takes place—is somehow serving a third term.&quot; - again, not paying attention; Nixon&#39;s serving out his fifth (?) term, because he engineered a constitutional amendment to allow him to do so.</p>

<p>Yeesh. </p>

<p>PS: To give Snyder credit, he did film Tales of the Black Freighter as an animated movie, which will get a separate release. Apparently, the special edition of the Watchman DVD interweaves the two as intended.</p></span>

<p>I am only an occasional visitor, but I wanted to thank you for so articulately explaining some of the problems with the very concept of a Watchmen movie. It is quite refreshing after the dull incomprehension of many of my friends. So, cheers!</p></span>

		<span id="comment-150370479-content"><p>It takes a poor critic to confuse an unreliable narrator with an authorial stand-in.</p>

<p>But since I couldn&#39;t care less about the film, I&#39;ll go back to the &quot;fate of the human race&quot; comment, which appears to bear on the book.  It&#39;s really, really ignorant to call this &quot;metaphysical vulgarity&quot; in this instance.  And it&#39;s not actually that great to historicize this as a period piece of the 1980s either.  It&#39;s about a fit of sustained insanity that really does threaten life on Earth since before the 1980s, and still does.  All those weapons haven&#39;t gone away.</p>

<p>And <i>Watchmen</i> makes no sense unless you&#39;re willing and able to take this seriously.  Dr. Manhattan, Ozymandius, Rorschach, The Comedian, Nite Owl: all of them illustrate ways in which this insanity is justified as being sane.  Of course it&#39;s insane to blow up half New York to ensure world peace.  But that&#39;s really not so different from risking blowing up the world in order to ensure world peace.  Dr. Manhattan enables, Rorschach with his right-wing beliefs justifies, The Comedian gives a note of nihilist cynicism, and Oymandius is the technocrat who reluctantly carries it all out.  The most sympathetic character to the ordinary reader, Nite Owl, stands in for the ordinary citizen -- he just hides in his basement and doesn&#39;t think about it, and when he finally does decide that he can do something, his reaction to confronting the system is to accept its reasoning.</p>

<p>One weakness of the book is that its sole female main character(s), Silk Spectre mother and daughter, are subsumed into their chosen roles as relatively passive sex objects, and thus stand for the part of the system that ordinary patriarchy would have them stand for.  I&#39;m not sure how Moore could have written it differently, but that always strikes me as a major flaw of the work.</p>

<p>All that sounds chilly, and, worse, naive -- you&#39;re not supposed to have art works refer to reality in that sense.  Tomemos mentions that Lane cites <i>Maus</i> and <i>Persepolis</i> -- both easier works because of their essential sentimentality.  A critic who can appreciate them but not <i>Watchmen</i> just reveals his limitations as a critic.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-150374217-content"><p>&quot;He writes as though sentences in books are autonomic emissions of the author-function, unlike in movies, where they&#39;re contextualized by speaker and setting&quot;</p>

<p>I wonder, anyone noticed this more generally among film scholars and critics? Is there some deep institutional compulsion to deny continuity from literature due to early anxieties of influence?</p>

<p>I remember my first introduction to academic film, watching Citizen Kane in Mass Communication. The professor noted that never before had a film begun at the end and then filled in the viewer through flashbacks. I (a sophomore English major who had just come from World Lit) raised my hand and proposed that this was merely the &quot;in media res&quot; narrative structure that Homer used. The professor actually waved his hand at me, pooh-poohed me: &quot;This is something completely different!&quot;</p></span>

<p>... The allusion to Dr. Manhattan at the end is interesting as an implied criticism of Gaddis-style modernism.  The book may have all kinds of intratextuality that makes it as intricate as the universe seen from Dr. M&#39;s mind.  But can the rest of us live, or read, like that?</p></span>

Bubbly undergraduates escort groups of thirty or so prospective students and their parents around Ring Road. After conferencing with students for a few hours, SEK runs to the Zot-n-Go for coffee. He wears his typical day-of-office-hours attire: an expensive sweater, rumpled jeans, trusty shoes and a backwards New York Mets cap. As he leaves he bumps into a FORMER STUDENT escorting prospectives and their parents around Ring Road. FORMER STUDENT: To your left you'll see the Student Center and the Zot-n-Go. Coming out of the Zot-n-Go is my favorite composition teacher ever (SEK waves and smiles politely as she puts her hand to her face and in an exaggerated whisper says) who actually wears that cap to class sometimes. PARENT: (loudly) Fucking loser. SEK: (stops) Excuse me? SEK turns to confront PARENT and sees the sort of uptight wealthy white folk who grow on trees out here. He comes from money and married young and is likely upset at how much a college education costs. He has a foot and about 100 lean lbs. on SEK. PARENT: You heard me. (steps to SEK) SEK: (walking backwards) I have office hours to attend to. PARENT: That's what I thought. SEK: (confused) You thought I had office hours? Because he ain't too bright, it is only now that SEK realizes that this forty-year-old in a starched business suit complete with snappy suspenders is trying to pick a fight with him. In broad daylight. On Ring Road. In front of his kid and a group of strangers. The PARENT makes for SEK, who shoots him a look and says . . . FROM THE DESK OF THE ACEPHALOUS INDUSTRIES LEGAL DEPARTMENT: SEK hereby declines to inform you what he allegedly said because his response might be construed as lame and unnecessarily inflammatory. In lieu of gratifying your desire to know what SEK allegedly said, SEK respectfully requests you guess what words were expelled by his constitutionally &quot;smart mouth.&quot; Furthermore: SEK acknowledges that although the unflattering description uttered by PARENT may not be inaccurate, at the time of the utterance said PARENT had no knowledge of this fact.</span></a></div>
