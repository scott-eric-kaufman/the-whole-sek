Ambitious English teachers (sic!) now invent systems that have nothing
to do with literature or life but everything to do with those games
that must be played in order for them to rise in the academic
bureaucracy. Their works are empty indeed. But then their works are not
meant to be full! They are to be taught, not read. The long dialogue
has broken down. Fortunately, as Flaubert pointed out, the worst thing
about the present is the future. One day there will be no…. But
I have been asked not to give the game away. Meanwhile, I shall drop a
single hint: Only construct!</p></blockquote><p>How does this pertain to CR's post or the conversation over on <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/le_langue_de_bois_christopher_hitchens/">the Valve</a>?&nbsp; I don't know anymore.&nbsp; I knew when I started writing, but that was a long, long time ago, like paragraphs, man, and I can barely see to scroll...</p>

Then on another blog the banner accused me of stalking him. I confessed, saying: Busted! When you check your counter again--T-minus thirty seconds and countin'--you'll see that since I've written this, I've reloaded your blog another 17 (SEVENTEEN!) times. Ten minutes from now, I'll have reloaded it another 37 (THIRTY-SEVEN!) times. Ten minutes from then, and you'll have another 101 (ONE HUNDRED AND ONE! OH MY!) reloads. On a Sunday morning (OH MY!). From my cell-phone. During services at Higher Heights Full Gospel Baptist Church Ministies. While being threatened with e-ternal damnation for my de-plorable de-pravities, my de-pletory de-precations, and don't you forget, my sons, nor you, my daughters, my de-testable de-pedence on the fruits of my bounty of sin (OH MY!)... &quot;It's unfathomable,&quot; you think, &quot;that anyone could believe that something other than the honest, heartfelt confession of a stalker.&quot; You're an idiot...but not alone. In response to the afore-linked post on my banishment, John Bruce graced my comments with some of his trademark &quot;apt and memorable locution,&quot; writing: Your little &quot;clique and claque&quot; routine might seem harmless to you, but I already got Jonathan Goodwin's Bradley Foundation summer grant frozen. Don't you remember what I wrote the other day? Don't mock me because 1) I've got a &quot;little man,&quot; 2) I don't &quot;get&quot; irony, or 3) I think boulet is the coolest word ever. If you want to mock me, do it because 1) my opinion of myself is so inflated I believe I could be responsible for Jonathan Goodwin losing his summer grant, 2) because I attack people for, among other things, &quot;mix[ing] UK and US spelling&quot; even though I mix UK and US rules on the correct placement of commas and periods relative to quotation marks--like I did in the very same post in which I criticized Miriam Jones for &quot;mix[ing] UK and US spelling,&quot; something I'd think ironic if I could identify irony when it isn't putting its boot to my neck, demanding I scream its name (and even sometimes when it is)--or 3) because I can't stop talking about how many hits I get, you know, because I spend hours watching that hit-counter click higher and higher, even though it's probably more people popping on by to have a laugh at my expense. Damn! His elocution is apt to the motherfuckin' memorable extreme. But today he dropped another apt and memorable elocutionary bomb. Check this shit out: Likewise, the frequent commenter on The Valve A. Cephalous had a similar reaction a couple of weeks ago -- same thing, 20 or 30 visits a day. Both the Linguistics prof and the Androgynous Cephalous would leave multiple furious comments on many posts -- it goes back to my suggestion that if someone's mad, maybe it's because someone else has a point. The A.Cephalous got so weird, it started posting with other people's names, and I...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/ep.html"><span><strong>The Pathetic Gropings of a Former Linguistics Major, or Walter Benn Michaels, the Insufficient Refutation, Part II</strong> [Note to Ray: The following may disturb you.] [Note to Everyone Else: The following may bore you.] [Note to Sean: I find this frustrating and fascinating.] In my response Sean's request for more on my problems with Walter Benn Michaels' argument in The Shape of the Signifier, I came to the following fruitless conclusion: what's at issue in debates of History vs. Memory is really a matter of individual responsibility vs. collective trauma/guilt. Individual responsibility can be historically compartmentalized, whereas collective trauma/guilt necessarily extends to all members of the collective, past, present and future. In political terms, collective trauma/guilt subtends claims for slavery reparations; furthermore, it focuses attention on the sins of the past instead of the inequities of the present (and therefore botches the opportunity to hold contemporary individuals responsible for the actions that've created/perpetuated these inequities). I'm with Michaels there. I can see why the representation of this continuity in literature would also--if we grant culture this sort of formative power--have implications for politics at large, i.e. dispense with the idea of collective guilt on television and in books and movies and people might think differently. But even though I grant culture the ability to shape thought thusly, I'm not sure that sense of collective trauma and collective guilt could be eliminated. Logically, and ideally, it should be; but I'm not sure it's possible. Without saying that the capacity for this collectivist sense is hard-wired, I'd say I strongly believe that it's a necessary by-product of how humans have and will continue to interact. I realize I've backed myself into a corner, because I not only can't explain why I strongly believe that, I'm also well aware that I might only believe it because of the limitations imposed on my horizons by the cultural moment in which they've been shaped. And, of course, short of undertaking a Gadamerian intellectual history of the past 3,957 years, I can't responsibly refute that latter claim. In short, I currently think that that is necessarily true, but I can't substantiate that claim. A couple hours later, I've devised a satisfactory way to talk about hard-wired models of historical continuity. I'm going to avoid the claims of evolutionary psychology; that is, I'm not going to try to explain why the collectivist model is a universal human default. Instead, I'm going to demonstrate, quickly, how language is built from the bottom-up and use that bolster the idea of an innate collectivism. So... ...Benjamin Whorf came up with the whole notion of cryptotypes, by which he meant pretty much the same thing Chomsky does by deep structure; namely, a level of linguistic categorization that is not directly visible/audible but explains why a language behaves in a particular way. One commonality of all languages is the dual inclusive/exclusive and plural inclusive/exclusive syntax distinctions. They look like this: 1st person dual inclusive - &quot;you and I&quot; 1st person dual exclusive - &quot;he/she and I&quot; 1st person plural inclusive - &quot;we two/three/four/etc. and you&quot; 1st person plural exclusive...</span></a></div>
