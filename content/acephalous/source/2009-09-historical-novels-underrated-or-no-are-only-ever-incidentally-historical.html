Long pedantic version: The most basic definition of the historical novel is situational: if the moment the novel represents occurs prior to the moment in which it is written, the novel is historical.

It may seem odd to confine historical novels within the realist movement, but if we define the genre attitudinally—if the sole criterion for inclusion is a dogged historical disposition—our reckoning must include modernist novels that, though obsessed with history, nevertheless fail to conform to the fuzzy notion of the historical novel we’re refining here. Not that there aren’t some modernist works, like John Dos Passos’s U.S.A. trilogy, that warrant inclusion, but they do so on the basis of being “realist enough,” and in so doing confirm our belief that the historical novel is a subset of realism—or better yet, a mode of the realist genre that entails a particular distance from and attitude towards historical events. This means that historical romances like Rob Roy—written in 1817 about the England and Scotland in 1715—are excluded, but early realist novels like Huck Finn—written in 1884 about events in 1840 or thereabout—squeeze in.

<p>The most basic definition of
the historical novel is situational: if the moment the novel represents
occurs prior to the moment in which it is written, the novel is
historical. The conceptual problem with this definition is its
expansiveness: any novel not written about the perpetual present or the
future will be historical so long as it is sufficiently realist. (More
on the necessity of limiting this discussion to realist novels
shortly.) However, as the identifying characteristics of a given period
become visible through age—think smile-lines or wrinkled foreheads—even
those works set in the perpetual present become dated. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0394726413/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Bright Lights, Big City</em></a> was a novel <em>of</em> the 1980s when it was published in 1984; now, it reads like an historical novel <em>about</em> the 1980s, for the simple reason that any novel that sufficiently captures a <em>zeitgeist</em>
also documents it for it future generations.&#0160; Such novels become a sort
of historical artifact whose usefulness depends on the acuity and
fidelity of their documentation: a perceptive author deeply indebted to
the realist tradition will record an immense quantity of high-quality
period detail. This being the case, these novelists of the perpetual
present belong to a more anthropological than historical tradition.&#0160; An
obvious distinction, but one which must be made lest we claim that all
realist novels are historical by dint of being old.</p>
<p>So then, the historical novel is not historical because it belongs
to history, but because its author makes a concerted effort to address
historical material in a realist mode. It may seem odd to confine
historical novels within the realist movement, but if we define the
genre attitudinally—if the sole criterion for inclusion is a dogged
historical disposition—our reckoning must include <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141182806/diesekoschmar-20">modernist novels</a>
that, though obsessed with history, nevertheless fail to conform to the
fuzzy notion of the historical novel we’re refining here. Not that
there aren’t some modernist works, like John Dos Passos’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1883011140/diesekoschmar-20"><em>U.S.A.</em></a>
trilogy, that warrant inclusion, but they do so on the basis of being
“realist enough,” and in so doing confirm our belief that the
historical novel is a subset of realism—or better yet, a mode of the
realist genre that entails a particular distance from and attitude
towards historical events. This means that historical romances like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192817639/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Rob Roy</em></a>—written in 1817 about the England and Scotland in 1715—are excluded, but early realist novels like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1883011884/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Huck Finn</em></a>—written in 1884 about events in 1840 or thereabout—squeeze in.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that most people would include <em>Rob Roy</em> and exclude <em>Huck Finn</em>—the
former on the basis of its reliance of historical events and
personages, the latter because Mark Twain made it all up and novels
consisting of unadulterated fictions are not rightly called historical.
Of course, not all of <em>Huck Finn</em> is an invention: the time and
its quarrels, the people and their prejudices, and the river and its
course are all faithfully recreated in the novel, but somehow that is
not enough to convince our gut that <em>Huck Finn</em> deserves to be called an historical novel. However, the desire to include <em>Rob Roy</em>
speaks to another defining characteristic of historical novels: the
presence of historical events and personages. It also demonstrates that
their presence alone is insufficient—the narrative in which they appear
must conform to a realist ethos or we risk including rousing yarns of
how George Washington single-handedly defeated the Hessians with egg
yolk and a tuning folk.</p>
<p>Historical novels, then, must depict historical events and
personages while adhering to a realist ethos: its narrative need not be
historically <em>faithful</em>, but at a minimum it must be historically <em>plausible</em>. Plausibility matters so much that even novels about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553560735/diesekoschmar-20">far-flung futures</a>
can make a case for being historical novels. This is why, to my mind,
categorizing historical novels according to their modal characteristics
is more productive than doing so by their content. It may seem odd to
say that the defining characteristic of historical novels is something
other than their historical content, but the manner in which that
content is addressed allows us to include novels relating to present
(Dreiser’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1931082316/diesekoschmar-20"><em>An American Tragedy</em></a>) or future (Robinson’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553560735/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Red Mars</em></a>) histories, and exclude novels whose manifest historical content is overwhelmed by romantic conventions (Scott’s <em>Rob Roy</em>) or implausible heroics (Weir Mitchell’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1417992077/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Hugh Wynne, Free Quaker: Sometime Brevet Lt. Col. of His Excellency General Washington</em></a>).</p>
<p>In sum, defining the historical novel as a realist mode allows us to
include the works we want to and exclude the ones we don’t and by “we”
I of course mean “I.” You’re more than welcome to disagree, which is
what my committee, none too impressed that I’d argued <em>Rob Roy</em> into the ether, did during my qualifying exams. Their main objections concerned my reliance on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it">pornographic</a>
notion of plausibility and an insufficiently articulated idea that
historical novels address social evolution. If you’ve read this far,
you know that I’ve again neglected to articulate that idea in the body
of my argument, only this time I did so for a reason: it allows novels
I’ve booted from the porch sneak back in through the barn. If I
designate “the depiction of social evolution” to be a defining
characteristic of the historical novel, <em>Rob Roy</em> and <em>Huck Finn</em>
are back in; but if I claim that the depiction is incidental because it
is impossible to accurately track historical developments forward in
time without also capturing the response of a society to those
developments, <em>Rob Roy</em> and <em>Huck Finn</em> are still out . . . which is where I believe they belong.</p><p>(<em>x-posted <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/09/04/historical-novels-underrated-or-no-are-only-ever-incidentally-historical/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/historical_novels_underrated_or_no_are_only_ever_incidentally_historical/">here</a></em>.)</p>

Science fiction, then is a kind of historical petri dish, an array of historical simulations projected into the future.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve not no real dog in the definitional argument you&#39;re making here, except that I do take exception to the attempt to make contemporary novels historical in retrospect: as an historian, the difference between a primary source and a secondary one is pretty critical. I use contemporary literature as a primary source in my courses; I would never use historical literature, even if I found some I liked, because the caveats and conditionals necessary to preface the discussion would take the entire semester.</p></span>

Cheered by this reflection, he classified novels by their tones. There are only two tones, personal and impersonal, and having given examples of each he grew pensive again and said, &quot;Yes, but you must have genius too, or neither tone will profit.&quot;</blockquote></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a54d1c49970b-content"><p>Luther:</p>

<p><em>[I]t is &quot;historical&quot; not because it represents the past but because it represents, as its central conflict, the shift from one cultural order to another one diachronically rather than synchronically[.]</em></p>

<p>That is, of course, part of what my committee wanted to hear: a larger argument about how, due to formal necessity, novels must represent/register/reflect—depending on which breed of historicism you favor—social/cultural/political progress.  I didn&#39;t buy it then, and I&#39;m not sure I buy it now, if only because many novels are reactionary—socially conservative in the sense that they hope to preserve the social structures of two minutes ago for which they are nostalgic.  I can buy that there&#39;s some creep in that &quot;two minutes ago,&quot; such that even the most staunch preservationist would unwittingly register/reflect—but never, never consciously represent—that slow skulk from the Golden Age of enforced social protocol into an unconscionable anarchy of the ordinary.</p>

<p><em>I don&#39;t think a historical need be realist or romantic, any more than historical writing over the past 300 years has been all realist or romantic in its worldview. </em></p>

<p>I know you know where I&#39;m getting that distinction from, but for those who don&#39;t, I&#39;m building on the Watt/McKeon notion that the novel is not a development of the romantic tradition, but a protest against it.  Hence, the mockery in <em>Don Quixote</em> and ubiquity of the phrase &quot;Being a History of . . .&quot; in early novels like Fielding&#39;s <em>The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews, And of his Friend Mr. Abraham Adams, Written in Imitation of The Manner of Cervantes, Author of <b>Don Quixote</b></em>.</p>

<p>For the record: I&#39;m specifying a particularly Anglo-American and Continental notion of the &quot;historical novel,&quot; not speaking generally about the relationship of history to its novelistic representations.  I thought I&#39;d made that clear by identifying the historical novel as a particular mode of the realist novel, but as always, what I think I&#39;ve written and what I actually have differ in important respects.</p>

<p>Jonathan:</p>

<p><em>[S]cience fiction often rests on a concept of historical causation (for Asimov, it was human nature; for Herbert, genetics; for Heinlein, a kind of frontier spirit often crushed by institutional idiocy; etc.) which the author uses to create the projection.</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s an integral element of my definition of plausibility.  To be vulgar about it, if you write a novel about transnational corporations deciding to settle Mars and turn it into a communist utopia, your narrative has mistaken utopian fancy for political reality.  A future in which compromise plays no part fails every conceivable plausibility test.</p>

<p><em>I do take exception to the attempt to make contemporary novels historical in retrospect: as an historian, the difference between a primary source and a secondary one is pretty critical.</em></p>

<p>But I didn&#39;t do that!  I said that those novels are anthropological, not historical, and as such must always be treated as primacy sources.</p>

<p>Nick:</p>

<p>I am being a bit flip, but that&#39;s only because on the blog I can indulge in what I think even the most serious of scholars indulges: I can justify my intuitions via argument.  It&#39;s not very scientific of me, but then again, I don&#39;t think that Moretti&#39;s classifications of 19th Century novels are any less idiosyncratic.  They&#39;re defensible, absolutely, but they still rely on an understanding of the shape and contour of narrative that hardcore structuralists would laugh at.</p></span>

<p>However, I agree at bottom with Coleridge&#39;s comments about Scott: what is historical in the historical novel is not the details but the larger structure of conflict between two worldviews, one of which is identified as &quot;on the way out&quot; and one of which is identified as &quot;on the way in.&quot;  At their best -- such as Scott&#39;s *Waverley* or Cooper&#39;s *The Last of the Mohicans* or Hugo&#39;s *Les Miserables* -- they mix a nostalgia for the best of what&#39;s being lost with a suspicious optimism about what was gained.</p>

<p>I always read McKeon as arguing that the novel is shaped by the realist/romance dialectic, not that the novel is uniformly a realist reaction against romance.  It may have started out as the realism to the romance, but it eventually incorporates romance, to the point where Hawthorne is writing about whether his own novels (or what we call &quot;novels&quot; today) were novels or romances, or where Scott created a hybrid of genres.  </p></span>

<p>Oh, believe me, the reference to Forster was intended as a compliment. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think of <i>Aspects of The Novel</i> as serious literary criticism, but it is a beautiful piece of writing in both style and content. I mentioned the fact that your final paragraph reminded me of Forster as a tip of the hat to nice bit of writing.</p>

The word &quot;skeptical&quot; functions as a subject complement in this clause. The particular complement here is a predicate adjective: the adjective &quot;skeptical&quot; describes an attribute of the subject &quot;critics.&quot; But hidden beneath that grammatical nicety is an utter falsehood. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a &quot;critic&quot; is &quot;one who pronounces judgment on any thing or person; esp. one who passes severe or unfavorable judgment; a censurer, fault-finder, caviller.&quot; Someone who is &quot;skeptical,&quot; however, is &quot;inclined or imbued with [an] attitude of doubt or incredulity as to the truth of some assertion or supposed fact.&quot; Because a critic has already pronounced a severe or unfavorable judgment, he can no longer be considered an honest skeptic because he has ceased doubting by acting upon truths not in evidence. Dishonest skeptics, then, would be those who act upon their doubts because there exists no fact powerful enough to compel them to shuck their skeptical posturing. They are critics for whom skepticism is a convenient prop employed in the service of their criticism; and because they only doubt those truths uttered by those they criticize, their skepticism is not dispositive but tactical. They are not &quot;disposed&quot; to doubt so much as they doubt all statements of a political nature made by those they oppose irrespective of the truth or falsity of their claims. So: &quot;Critics are skeptical of the President's claim that it is raining.&quot; That won't be heard because the content of the statement is apolitcal, so dishonest skeptics will accept it on its face. However: &quot;Critics are skeptical of the President's claim that it has rained more this year than last.&quot; This statement will compel dishonest skeptics to disbelieve its content, not because it is true or false, but because it could be implicated in a larger political discussion about global warming or the progress of stimulus-aided improvement to the capital grounds. However, had that second statement been made by someone who is himself a dishonest skeptic, his fellows in skeptical dishonesty would concur because, even if it were implicated in a larger political discussion, it would be speaking on behalf of their agenda. These dishonest skeptics are not skeptical: they are unabashedly and unashamedly critical. By predicating an attribute to them that they do not actually possess, news organizations mask ideological rigidity behind a scrim of cautious deliberation. All of which is only to say that if I don't stop watching the news in the morning, these papers will never be graded, that cover letter will never be written, this writing sample will never be revised . . .</span></a></div>
