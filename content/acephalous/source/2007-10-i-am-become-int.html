<p>I laughed at the above rather more than it&#39;s probably worth, but it really is the perfect hip-hop gangsta boast for a physicist, and I always suspected that Oppenheimer was using it somewhat in that sense originally.</p>

<p>Why were people intimidated?  Probably because, in terms how much attention and outside readership academics usually get, you&#39;re a celebrity.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-85704450-content"><p>My sense from having gotten some similar comments is that the concept of doing this kind of writing - of exposing material in draft form, of <em>visibly</em> thinking out loud - is intimidating to some people.  There&#39;s a high level of redaction that goes into a journal article or other formal publication - most of us can look reasonably respectable when we put in that kind of time.  But even &quot;serious&quot; blog posts don&#39;t usually have that level of editing and concerted research work behind them - and therefore they show something about what kinds of knowledge and skills someone has at hand.  This is even more the case for comments and responses to discussions that are fairly clearly written on the fly - where it&#39;s obvious the maximum amount of time you <em>could</em> have spent on something, because you&#39;re responding to something &quot;live&quot;.</p>

<p>The reality is, many of the people intimidated by writing in this medium would probably do fine in the medium - it looks a bit scarier (maybe, to some people, a <em>lot</em> scarier) than it is...  Participating <em>feels</em> different from reading on...</p>

<p>There&#39;s also an issue of people finding it intimidating, the thought of exposing yourself to the level of public criticism involved - most other venues for academic criticism are more closed and ritualised - the range of questions and issues that might be raised are much more predictable (of course, this medium has its predictable aspects, as well - but, again, those patterns might not be as visible to people looking in from the outside...).  </p>

<p>And I think the different negotiations of personal/professional boundaries in the medium can strike people are requiring some level of courage - blogging usually does open up <em>more</em> of someone&#39;s personal relationship to their work than other media, and sometimes I think this can create an impression that it opens up <em>everything</em>, so that it can come across as though people are leaving themselves completely exposed...</p>

<p>But it&#39;s certainly not unusual, in my experience, for people to express these sorts of reactions.</p></span>

<p>Okay, just killed 10 minutes of morning prep trying to figure out the origin of this &#39;i am become&#39; issue. No thank you internets. I had thought that the &#39;I am become&#39; was a very literal translation of &#39;factus sum&#39; from the Vulgate. I used 2 Corinthians 12:11 (factus sum insipiens &amp;c.) as a test case. King James does this as &quot;I am become a fool in glorying,&quot; but the Wycliffite Bible (210 years earlier or so) reads &quot;Y am maad vnwitti,&quot; and my search of &quot;become&quot; in the Middle English Dictionary didn&#39;t turn up any first-person singular constructions among the quotes. Dang.</p>

<p>Oh, Scott: it&#39;s because you write a lot. Every academic, except perhaps Eileen Joy, thinks that every other academic has an easier time writing than he or she does.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-85766120-content"><p>Uncomplicatedly, you&#39;ve met that cat before, though, and know that he, too, is extremely silly.</p>

<p>Adam, why would people be intimidated by a douche?</p>

<p>Jonathan, linking to a search that only contains 1) works published in the mid-1800s and 2) contemporary works citing works published in the mid-1800s convinces me that, while not ungrammatical, it&#39;s certainly archaic.  Also, it&#39;s memorable because it&#39;s oddly phrased.  Put it this way: if you saw that in a student paper, how would you react? </p>

<p>Sophie, stop encouraging Jonathan, lest his comments on everyone&#39;s posts am become little more than endless nitpicking.</p>

<p>Rich, that word&#39;s the one I tried to avoid.  Kugelmass and I were talking about it yesterday, and the conclusion was that whatever I have is so different from &quot;celebrity&quot; so as to not even deserve the label.  It&#39;s to &quot;celebrity&quot; as Allen&#39;s <em>Celebrity</em> is to good, only less so.</p>

<p>Constructivist, my funny ratio is really low.  I mean, I stumble into something funny three times a year tops ... which is about how often I write something smart in an essay.  I need to up it.  One a month would be nice, one a week would land me tenure ...</p>

<p>Sisyphus, obviously, there&#39;s nothing wrong with silliness.  I think that&#39;s why Flowbear&#39;s comment accurately pegs the problem with the logic of &quot;seems approachable ... how intimidating.&quot;  But you&#39;re right, I think, that there&#39;s an element of misreading the self-deprecation.  Still, does anyone think Woody Allen actually has a strong sense of self-worth?  I suppose it takes a certain amount of arrogance to make a movie a year for thirty years, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the same kind of arrogance that people would find off-putting. </p>

<p>But I think you and Adam (and possibly more people, I&#39;m only up to this comment) may be on to something with the writing so much angle.  But I don&#39;t really write all that much.  I set aside an hour to not-write-the-dissertation everyday as a means of keeping myself sane.  Are people really intimidated by the slight act of preserving sanity?</p>

<p>Justin, it is a word.  I am to become one (<em>crosses fingers</em>) in a few months.</p>

<p>N.P., I like that: &quot;You&#39;re only intimidated because you&#39;re ignorant of the realities of the medium in which I write.  Get yourself educated, then come back and be much less impressed.&quot;  There&#39;s obviously something to it, but I think I like your phrasing better.  </p>

<p>Another point: it&#39;s not having the knowledge at hand, necessarily, but having mental access to it.  That&#39;s something I didn&#39;t have when I started blogging -- I couldn&#39;t discuss things I hadn&#39;t studied formerly or had, but not in some time, quite as easily as I can now.  The reason?  Practice.  All of which constitutes an argument for more academic blogging ... or less, since I like having a leg up on the competition.  </p>

<p>Adam, I actually have a spare head I employ for just these occasions, as you&#39;ll see from the conference photos shortly.</p>

<p>Karl, I&#39;m pretty sure most academics <em>do</em> have an easier time than I do, at least in formal terms.  And the fact you killed prep time at your new TT to research the origins of a phrase is pure pudding: it shows you&#39;re the kind of person who can&#39;t let a detail escape him once it&#39;s captured his attention, which is the sort of thing that makes for great scholarship.  Such displays are, in fact, intimidating.  (Or neurotic in a good, productive way.)</p>

<p>Anastasia, I appreciate that.  It&#39;s nice to know someone&#39;s opinion approximates the one a reasonable person should hold.</p>

<p>Esienkowski, are you sure about that?  I mean, this place looks damn cluttered to me still, and Jonathan claims it&#39;s nigh-unreadable.</p></span>

<p>I really enjoy reading your blog, but am too intimidated to comment often.  Part of it has to do with everything mentioned above: breadth of topics, ease of presentation/discussion, quality of snappy comebacks, avatar and layout.  The other part is that you&#39;ve managed to build such an incredible community here.  The commenters are equally snappy and witty and intelligent, therefore some conversations are hugely entertaining and interesting to witness while at the same time making me too paranoid to participate.  </p>

<p>Granted, this is my problem, not yours.  And I do suspect that it would be much easier to learn these things through practice.  Maybe I&#39;ll start my own blog to work up the courage to post comments elsewhere!</p></span>

<p>I&#39;ll take neurotic. Of course, as I rode the bike to school, the friggin <a href="http://french.about.com/library/weekly/aa010100.htm" rel="nofollow">passé composé</a> occurred to me, for example, the table for <i>devenir</i> at the link (&quot;je suis devenu,&quot; which is exactly what Sophie was getting at). The Anglo-Norman dictionary bears up the antiquity of the être + devenir construction in Britain, although unfortunately there&#39;s no first-person singular construction to help me out. My Kibler <i>Introduction to Old French</i> isn&#39;t helping me out either. Jerks.</p>

<p>I do research to procrastinate. I like that research makes me happy, but I don&#39;t like that it keeps me from actually writing, whatever that is....</p>

<p><i>Are people really intimidated by the slight act of preserving sanity?</i></p>

<p>Totally?</p></span>

<p>Silly, you are one now. You read, research and write about American scholarly topics. A scholar is someone who does scholarship, not one who has filed something and gotten three little letters. </p>

<p>Re: the self-deprecation .... I think a lot of people clam up when they are nervous or unsure of themselves, and those people don&#39;t recognize that constant talking/writing to fill space can be the same thing. </p>

<p>There might be a visibility/hiding opposition in effect as well ... do the people who hide when they are anxious think that putting oneself out there can&#39;t be the same thing in a way?</p></span>

(I keep it in my pocket, for those not-so-rare moments when someone questions my commitment to the profession ... or pain.) Its author was a child whose belief in his own genius was only outstripped by the arrogance with which he communicated it. A sampling: Debunking Kant's argument in full is now a simple matter of proving the self-evident ... Refuting Kant is simple! Bet you didn't know that. All those professional philosophers who devoted years of their lives to understanding him must be embarrassed now. Had they but known that a lowly undergraduate could render Kant irrelevant! But wait! Our young savior thinks Kant may still merit a place our intellectual orbit: Kant could be defended on account of his belief that judgments of taste, inasmuch as they concern themselves with objects of beauty, are aconceptual, because aconceptuality effectively eliminates the need for education in determinations of beauty. Huzzah! We can keep Kant! Unless ... unless that &quot;could be&quot; is conditional. I fear this student's novel use of &quot;aconceptual.&quot; (It would've caused an epiphanic recognition of the writer's brutal genius in any reasonably intelligent person. Lest ye be dull, the writer thwacks you with the cudgel of his savage brilliance by nouning his neologism.) By now I should know better; but still, I held out hope for dear Immanuel. Alas: But since I have shown that &quot;common sense&quot; and aconceptuality are both little more than the unconscious cultural constructions of an intellectual elite, it would be naive to mount a defense of Kant on this front. And it is, because he had: What if I were to see a pile of shit that, for whatever reason, satisfied me in that way particular to beauty? In Kant’s system of thought this example would be reckoned an impossibility, because &quot;common sense&quot; dictates that since I cannot reasonably believe that anyone else would consider this pile of shit beautiful, I cannot myself be satisfied by it. In all likelihood it would not be considered beautiful by the cultural elite, if for no other reason than its being a pile of shit. In this admittedly extreme example we can see the dynamic at work in the determination of the beautiful, in that, since I can only consider beautiful what I believe everyone else would, I am more than likely to find beautiful those things which I can safely consider to be beautiful. Inspired! Genius! Who among you refuses raving? The inspired genius speaks of piles of shit. To be so inspired, and by such genius, is the a feeling few among us will ever know. Treasure this, your memory of basking, then prepare yourself (as much as you, being you, can) for the reveal: The world that Kant unknowingly created is therefore one of arrogant institutions and a timid populace, reluctant to find beauty in extremes or satisfaction in the margins. Will someone get this...</span></a></div>
