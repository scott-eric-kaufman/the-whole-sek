<p><em>Mad Men</em> typically uses the <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48004">angle</a> and <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48009">level of framing</a> fairly conventionally.&#0160; Consider the scene in which Betty leaves for her rendezvous with Henry Francis:</p>

<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a832b5a6970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-2010-01-21-17h02m27s214" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a832b5a6970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a832b5a6970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a></p>

<p>The dominant character literally towers over the subservient one.&#0160; When the shot shifts to them individually, the angle of framing reinforces their respective positions.&#0160; Dominant Betty is shot from a slightly lower angle—you can tell the canting of the camera by the fact that the ceiling is almost visible:</p>

<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef012877362248970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-2010-01-21-17h02m12s62" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef012877362248970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef012877362248970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a></p>

<p>But although Draper is shot looking up at her, the camera is framed almost level to his head, meaning it is barely even tilted:</p>

<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a832b899970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-2010-01-21-17h02m14s82" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a832b899970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a832b899970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a></p>

<p>In visual terms, he is only barely the lesser party, which is in keeping with the tone of the scene (if not the season): he may not be dominant, but he is never subservient.&#0160; Because the camera is level with his head and its angle so slight, Draper appears to be in control of the scene, which leads to friction between its formal composition and narrative content.&#0160; Note also that in neither case does the angle of framing indicate that shot is from the <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48019">point of view</a> of either character.&#0160; Instead of <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#51531">reversing the shot</a> and having them look at the viewer, Weiner organizes the sequence by <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#98485">matching their eyelines</a>: she looks down from the left in an angled shot and he looks up from the right in a level one, almost as if the camera refuses to acknowledge that Draper&#39;s not the dominant one here.&#0160; Same thing happens when Draper tries to recruit Peggy:</p>

<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8330c18970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-2010-01-30-14h17m16s18" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8330c18970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8330c18970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a></p>

<p>The extremely traditional staging indicates that he&#39;s the supplicant, but even when he resorts to begging, this reverse shot is the weakest Weiner will allow Draper to look:</p>

<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8330dbf970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-2010-01-30-14h17m10s218" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8330dbf970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8330dbf970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a></p>

<p>He looks up from the right in a level medium close-up, although unlike the scene with Betty, he may actually be in control of this scene, meaning the non-angled framing would be ironic.&#0160; He may be the supplicant, as the composition of the establishing shot tells us, but this reverse shot indicates that he already knows how his plea will be answered.&#0160; This shot is, after all, when he reminds Peggy that they are kindred:</p><blockquote><p>There are people out there who buy things.&#0160; People like you and me and something happened.&#0160; Something terrible.&#0160; And the way that they saw themselves is gone.&#0160; And nobody understands that. But you do and that’s very valuable.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s telling her that being knocked up by Pete and almost dying during a delivery that left her clinically insane makes her &quot;very valuable&quot; to him.&#0160; It is, then, an odd but strong bond he appeals to here, but one which he believed would be effective: he may not be able to assume her allegiance, but he knows he can needle her secret trauma to great effect.&#0160; As it does.&#0160; They&#39;re equals by the next reverse shot:</p>

<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8331ced970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-2010-01-30-14h17m47s80" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8331ced970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8331ced970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a></p>

<p>Much like everybody in that first frame above:</p>

<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8331e6a970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-2010-01-30-14h18m26s210" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8331e6a970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8331e6a970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a></p>

<p>Or not: the partners occupy the foreground, their juniors and the head secretary the background.&#0160; They&#39;re not equals, but the subsequent camerawork tells us that they&#39;re not as unequal as they were before.&#0160; When it cuts to Peggy and Pete, the level of the camera jumps up and frames them in a medium shot:</p>

<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a83320f1970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-2010-01-30-14h18m21s156" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a83320f1970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a83320f1970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a> <br />The level then shifts down when it cuts back to Draper:</p>

<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8332171970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-2010-01-30-14h18m40s92" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8332171970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8332171970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a></p>

<p>At least in terms of composition, they are close to coequals.&#0160; (Especially when compared to the ubiquitous shots of Draper pacing behind his desk and looking down at whichever underling happened to be seated before it.)&#0160; It is at this point that something really remarkable happens.&#0160; In my <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/01/mand-men-and-visual-rhetoric.html">first post on the visual rhetoric of the show</a>, I noted that &quot;[n]o contemporary television show employs a quieter camera than <em>Mad Men.</em>&quot;&#0160; So how does Weiner choose to end this scene?&#0160; Dynamically:</p><p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef012877368dbc970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-2010-01-30-14h19m12s156" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef012877368dbc970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef012877368dbc970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a> <br /> <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8332590970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-2010-01-30-14h19m16s198" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8332590970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a8332590970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a> <br /><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a83325bf970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-2010-01-30-14h19m18s217" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a83325bf970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a83325bf970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a></p><p>The zoom is all the more effective because of the degree of its departure from the established conventions of the show.&#0160; </p>

Ann Althouse!It seems to me that the President is the victim of his own ideas about how to do things differently. If he had graciously accepted the inheritance left by George Bush, he wouldn't have had either of these problems. He squandered an inheritance that he failed to value! Bush—despite his reputation for simplicity—did understand the complexity of the problem, and he had a solution. There was stability. After posturing about &quot;change&quot; in his political campaign, Barack Obama seemed to think that he could apply the immense power he had won to changing things in the real world.Shorter? The President suffers from the delusion that he wants to do things differently. If he had just wanted to continue doing what Bush had done, he wouldn't have wanted to do things differently. Bush understood that stuff is hard, and he solved different hard stuff the same way every time. Obama said he wanted to solve different hard stuff differently during the election, and once he won it, he suckered himself into believing that he could wield the power he won to solve hard stuff his own way.Second-order shorter: It seems to me that Ann Althouse often writes about ideas she does not have. If she had ideas, she would write about them instead of the having of them, but because she only writes about the having of them, no one ever knows what they are. Her posts are like pictures of laptops idling on tables at which no one works: ideas could potentially be communicated through them, but for now they deliver no actual content, only the low hum of pointlessly cycling hard drives. Warning: Because her name has appeared three times in this post, she will, of course, show up in the comments and claim that her vacuousness is actually a vortex into which someone has been sucked. (Someone should alert her to the definition of &quot;vacuum&quot; that doesn't involve suction.)</span></a></div>
