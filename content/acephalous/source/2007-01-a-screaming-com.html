<p><strong>HOUSTON, Jan. 5 —</strong> Brennen de Vuurst, media liaison for NASA’s <a href="http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/">Near Earth Object Program</a>, confirmed reports that <a href="http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/abf_friday_its_party_time/">the large, glowing object</a> detected on October 2006 is on a collision course with Earth.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&quot;If it stays on its current course,&quot; de Vuurst said, &quot;it will land somewhere in central Pennsylvania early next week.&quot;</p>

<p>Reported sightings of the enormous spherical object have poured into NEO headquarters all week.</p>

<p>&quot;I went online to check my email,&quot; <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/">Scott Eric Kaufman</a> told reporters, &quot;when what appeared to be the <em>Hindenburg</em>—only faster, more determined—barreled past my window.&quot;</p>

<p>On Monday, NEO scientists claimed these eyewitness reports were mistaken.&nbsp; What they had seen, the NEO declared, were <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2007-01-05-russian-rocket_x.htm">the remains of a spent Russian rocket booster</a> falling to earth. </p>

<p>NORAD officials could not confirm the NEO’s account, citing
discrepancies between the time the Russian SL-4 booster reportedly
crashed in Riverton, Wyoming and the accounts of Kaufman and other
credible witnesses.</p>

<p>&quot;Seeing how the Russian booster went down and stayed down around 6
a.m. Monday morning,&quot; said NORAD’s Seau de Honnêteté, &quot;the odds of it
being the thing reported today are slim.&quot; </p>

<p>De Honnêteté characterizes the NEO’s response to the situation as
&quot;stunningly unoptimal—a grave underestimation of the megacatastophic
power of a planet-killer three times hotter than the sun.&quot;</p>

<p>De Vuurst’s NEO colleague, Dr. Gesam T. Verwüstung, disagrees.&nbsp; &quot;An
impact of that magnitude could vaporize the East Coast, rend the very
fabric of civilization, but such an outcome is improbable.&nbsp; Most
likely, women and liberals will complain.&quot;</p>

<p>Should you see this object as it makes it way to <a href="http://www.michaelberube.com/">University Park</a>, authorities ask that you immediately commemorate its passage on your local Internets.</p>

If upon mature deliberation you decide the misery of forgiving your underlings for their alarming account of Mr. Kaufman's recent troubles is something you must bear alone, know now that I approve of your fortitude. One of my women once spoke so prematurely. Last word reached our civilized shores, her punishment more than adequately accorded with the severity of her indiscretion. Mr. Chathworth tells me it involved tigers! I titter at the thought of her grisly evisceration! Most Sweet Sinistral, No one had informed me of your doings, either! I informed Mr. Kaufman when first I heard the results of his trial. Had I but known what you knew, we could have spared him much unrest. In the future we must confer before relating news whose destiny is to disturb. Perhaps we should consider our legs forfeit to a tiger? Beloved Dextral, I am rather fond of my legs, as is Mr. Chathworth, who says they are the second finest in the closet in which we neck like parrots stretching for the nut. Were it not for his attentions I would admit of my gross error and bow on bended knee before Mr. Kaufman. Begging his forgiveness, the closet in which Chathworth and I neck is most regal, truly worthy of the beknighted knickers which cascade down his legs and rumple around those most delicious ankles. When I grasp his tight bu— Silly Sinistral, I abhor interrupting so sweet a voice as yours, but Chathworth and his quality posterior are of no issue here. We must recompense poor Mr. Kaufman for— Dex, Much as it pains me to say, you must move on. Chathworth is mine. If you cannot accept his choi— Sin, This is not about accepting anyone's decision. This is about telling Mr. Kaufman that a clerical error forced us to write him a most terrible missive, one whose implications we would have foreseen had we but communicated more openly beforehand. We should have examined his medical record and realized that the medication responsible for arousing our suspicions was prescribed by one of our own. He deserves word of his being as robust as the bull-ox your delicate Mr. Chathworth so dotes on ...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/01/the_dictionary_.html"><span><strong>The Dictionary of All Scriptures and Myths</strong> No more laughing at Casaubon's hubris—as of today, the necessity of his failure loses its necessariness. But for his untimely demise, he could have succeeded, as G.A. Gaskell's Dictionary of All Scriptures and Myths demonstrates. From the dust jacket: This classic reference guide to more than 5000 words and phrases of the Sacred Language is now available for the many thousands who have been searching for a complete, authoritative dictionary on the symbolism and terms of world religions. Every Scripture and every Myth is defined with a clarity that defies misunderstanding. And perhaps even more important, here for the first time is a dictionary that treats the definition of the Scriptures according to the intentions of the original writers. Nowhere else can you find a book that deals as broadly and as completely with religious concepts as literature. And for each term, the DICTIONARY OF ALL SCRIPTURES AND MYTHS brings you: Clear explanations of the symbolism of ancient and modern religious words and phrases Numerous quotations from authoritative sources Thoughtful descriptions of the meaning of the terms and how they are used in Myths and Scriptures Complete cross reference The discovery of a metaphorical language underlying all sacred Scriptures of the world prompted Mr. Gaskell to write this dictionary which gives a more complete knowledge of man's inner nature and the purpose of his life on earth than was heretofore possible. For the first time ever, I resisted the urge to interleave complete, authoritative Sarcasm into the body of the quotation. Nowhere else will I defy my inner nature and the purpose of my life with such complete Restraint than in this authoritative post. Why? Its (many) problematic assumptions aside, Gaskell's compendium of COMPLETE WORLD KNOWLEDGE oozes erudition. The dust jacket again: For instance under the phrase &quot;Image of God,&quot; Mr. Gaskell quotes from the Bible, T. Aquinas, Harnack's History of Dogma, G.T. Ladd's Philosophy of Religion, C. Taylor's Sayings of the Jewish Fathers, and many more sources. Reading that list and pondering its many more sources—among them, A. Jukes, J. Bunyan, G. Milmine, I. Myer and the illustrious M.B. Eddy—you wouldn't particularly think this erudition would be all that much to fun to acquire secondhand. You'd be wrong. Absent from these descriptions is any hint of the joy to be derived from the skimming of this tome. All those literary scholars might be completely wrong about the entertainment value of Casaubon's dessicated monument to Christian syncretism. To draw the comparison more directly, Gaskell's readers will be entranced, Dorothea-like, not by the material or the manner of its revelation, but by the correspondences a mind overstuffed with information invariably produces. For example: DESERTS, VAST AND UNKNOWN :— Symbolic of primordial chaos—the infinite expanse of formless matter. &quot;Pwan-koo is described as appearing from the vast unknown deserts. He was four times taller than man, had horns on his head, and teeth protruding from his mouth.&quot;—Kidd, China, p.100. The Logos proceeds from the Chaos or Depth. The statement about height, refers to...</span></a></div>
