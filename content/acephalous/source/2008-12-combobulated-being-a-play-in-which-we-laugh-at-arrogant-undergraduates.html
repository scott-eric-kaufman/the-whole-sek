<p style="text-align: center;">(<em>In a small classrroom, a young professor is discussing an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001JL0BVW/diesekoschmar-20">R.P. Blackmur essay on Shakespeare’s sonnets</a> with a group of twelve or so students.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>TEACHER:</strong> Blackmur claims “the hues attract, draw, <em>steal</em> men’s eyes, but penetrate, discombobolate, <em>amaze</em> the souls or psyches of women.” What does he mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>CLASS:</strong> …?</p>
<p><strong>TEACHER:</strong> Break his sentence down. What does “discombobulate” mean?</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT #1:</strong> Bored?</p>
<p><strong>TEACHER:</strong> So Shakespeare’s language penetrates the souls of women by boring them? (<em>two engineering majors giggle</em>) How do you amaze someone by boring them?</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT #2:</strong> (<em>confidently</em>) It’s a technical term from Switzerland. Watchmakers call the tiny gears inside a watch “bobulates” (<em>beaming</em>)
and what a watchmaker does is he brings the bobulates together, and
“com” is the Latin for “together.” So the proper technical term for
this watch here (<em>points to his wrist</em>), or any working watch,
is to say it’s “combobulated.” But over the life of a watch, it gets
knocked around, and the gears get unaligned, and when that happens the
watch becomes “discombobulated.”</p>
<p><strong>TEACHER:</strong> Not “disbobulated”?</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT #2:</strong> That’s what I said, but he told me–</p>
<p><strong>TEACHER:</strong> He who?</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT #2:</strong> My rabbi.</p>
<p><strong>TEACHER:</strong> I see.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT #2:</strong> He said the Swiss wouldn’t be taken

sounds silly enough without the Latin prefix.</p>

<p>I still don’t know what Blackmur meant—nor why my rabbi conspired
with The Future to punk me—but as the MLA approaches, I’m increasingly
convinced that the first time I ever spoke up in class foreshadowed
some ominous end to my academic career.*&#0160; So while I’m not exactly sure
what end this start augurs, I take comfort in the fact that Dickens
didn’t know what he’d foreshadowed for Pip when he wrote the first

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/12/who-says-what-to-whom-now.html"><span><strong>Who says what to whom now?</strong> Mark Helprin—author of my favorite novel when I was a naive fourteen—published another well-written, ur-conservative editorials in the Wall Street Journal today. You can (and will) disagree with the sentiment, but you must admit that the man can control his clauses: The pity is that the war could have been successful and this equilibrium sustained had we struck immediately, preserving the link with September 11th; had we disciplined our objective to forcing upon regimes that nurture terrorism the choice of routing it out with their ruthless secret services or suffering the destruction of the means to power for which they live; had we husbanded our forces in the highly developed military areas of northern Saudi Arabia after deposing Saddam Hussein, where as a fleet in being they would suffer no casualties and remain at the ready to reach Baghdad, Damascus, or Riyadh in three days; and had we taken strong and effective measures for our domestic protection while striving to stay within constitutional limits and eloquently explaining the necessity—as has always been the case in war—for sometimes exceeding them. The children on the Corner think otherwise. According to Peter Wehner, Helprin’s editorial is both wrong and chock-full of “very sloppy writing.” The above soundly refutes the sloppiness argument, but you should know better than to expect sound arguments from people who think “Charles Krauthammer [is] America’s best columnist and one of our finest geopolitical thinkers.” My favorite bits: This is an example of very sloppy writing on the part of Helprin… I gather that Helprin is lamenting the fact that we did not attack Iraq immediately after 9/11. But we could barely attack Afghanistan immediately after September 11, 2001, and Afghanistan required a strategic innovation that Halperin totally ignores… Reading between the lines, his use of the word “eloquently” probably translates into “we need more speeches written by Mark Halperin.” It’s worth recalling, then, that Helprin’s most notable speechwriting achievement to date was penning Robert Dole’s 1996 acceptance speech, arguing that Dole would be our Bridge to the Past. The speech was a bust, and helped contribute to Dole’s loss to Bill Clinton… Helprin is right that many Democrats have been feckless. But if everyone from George W. Bush to Democrats have been feckless—and surely Helprin would throw in every other global ally on that spectrum, too—then Halperin is saying everybody, but him, has got it wrong. This is akin to the man on the highway who is going the wrong way and talks to his wife on the phone about how many morons are going the wrong way. However would he know what that feels like?

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/12/a-premla-preview-of-the-annual-postmla-article.html"><span><strong>A Pre-MLA Preview of the Annual Post-MLA Article</strong> Every year more than 10,000 literature scholars gather at the end of December for the convention of the Modern Language Association, the 124th of which begins next week in San Fransisco. Past conventions have yielded papers with titles that were rife with bad puns, cute pop-culture references and an adolescent preoccupation with sex, from “Neo-Victorian Buggery” to “Bambi as a Bottom” and the tragically hip “I Never Got Tenure (but I Owe My Job to Jay-Z): Capital-T Theory, Hip-Hop Culture, and Some Thoughts About the Role of Literature in Contemporary Literary Studies.” Founded in 1883, the Modern Language Association barely registered on the public consciousness for its first century. Professors attended to doze through papers about Chaucer and Emerson, schmooze one another and lobby for posts at more prestigious campuses. But in the 1980’s the conference became the site of annual skirmishes between old-school traditionalists and the increasing powerful new breed of postmodernists, multiculturalists, feminists and queer-theory advocates. Basking in this unaccustomed level of public notice, Modern Language Association scholars brought increasingly attention-grabbing papers to the convention through the 1990’s, “queering” the “canon,” some said, and championing the “postcolonial,” proposing wild theories about everything from comic books to hip-hop to television and movies. Last year, perhaps hoping to put a stop to the trend, the Chronicle of Higher Education announced its first Annual Awards for Self-Consciously Provocative M.L.A. Paper Titles (a k a the Provokies) but in 2004 the Chronicle decided to drop the awards. Scott McLemee, a senior writer at Inside Higher Ed, explained that “crafting titles to get them written about and attacked in the press used to be exciting. “Now it’s become a reflex, and their hearts aren’t really in it anymore.” Not only are titles no longer intended to amuse, from the looks of this year’s several thousand entries, absolutely nothing of any importance is studied by scholars who present at the MLA. From “‘Nabakov’s Self-Translations” to an entire panel devoted to African literature, these scholars embrace topics no right-thinking person cares about. Would Joe the Plumber attend a talk on “William Faulkner’s Rural Modernism”? Would Tito the Builder enjoy a twenty-minute talk on “History and Memory in [James Joyce’s] ‘The Dead’”? Does Joe Sixpack even know what PMLA is, much less want to be published in it? Why then would he attend the roundtable discussion “How to Get Published in PMLA“? While most Americans never bothered to acquaint themselves with old readings of Renaissance texts, the eggheads at the MLA insist on producing “New Readings of Renaissance Texts.” And there’s much, much more. But all of it is about unimportant nonsense. (x-stitched.)</span></a></div>
