Equilibrium (2002): The Machinist (2004): Batman Begins (2005): Just so I have this straight: a method actor exploded at a director of photography for twice interrupting his sight line while fiddling with the lights after the director had yelled &quot;SETTLE!&quot; and &quot;ACTION!&quot; and this is newsworthy?

To understand the significance of a thing, you have to understand the culture it comes from.

Several reviewers have commented that, despite the visual power of the movie, the dialogue is often trite and cliché-ridden; and one could add to these criticisms the obvious fact that the plot consists of two central components that are cinematic clichés: the disaster formula (of which the sinking of the Titanic is the classic example, for the great ship has sunk on movie and television screens over and over again throughout this century) and the romance between rich girl and poor boy. In this age of gender studies and queer theory, there are no surprises in this movie, no challenges to the dominance of heterosexuality; and any gestures toward feminism are of the safe variety that have become commonplace in popular movies, including several of Cameron's earlier action dramas . . . Titanic is not strictly Cameron's masterpiece, in the auteurist sense, because its power derives from mass culture and from a history of images that can be discovered only in retrospect . . .

		<span id="comment-147467165-content"><p>Bale is a competent actor but I don&#39;t find him extraordinarily talented or even brave. This outburst--where he proves what an egotistical bully he can be--should be a sign that he takes his job and possibly himself <i>way</i> too seriously. Lighten up Batman. This is Terminator 4, not brain surgery. </p>

<p>I noticed his accent does shift a lot throughout the clip. I think he has been forced to use different accents so many times that now he has come up with some new kind of accent unique only to him. </p></span>

In other words, I take it as a given that he takes his job way too seriously---that&#39;s the method way. </i></p>

<p>This almost makes me think Bale was having an identity crisis similar to the one Robert Downey Jr. and Ben Stiller had near the end of Tropic Thunder. Heh! I don&#39;t know much about method acting other than what is popularly said about it, but Bale still should have shown some professionalism, especially when the DP apologized to him several times and even explained himself at Bale&#39;s request. I also like how Bale refused to listen to McG and even told <i>him</i> what to do. You go, Bale! I still fear for his sanity... maybe he should take some time off from playing pretend and get in touch with himself for a few years. </p>

<p><i>After all, he does his damnedest to keep it throughout the months of shooting---press junkets included---but this guy has him so flustered he starts speaking like himself.</i></p>

<p>I noticed that when he was doing press stuff for Batman Begins, but he quit doing that when doing press for The Dark Knight. I think he&#39;s getting fed up with it. I don&#39;t blame him. </p></span>

Happens all the time. So often, in fact, you almost miss it when someone’s being deliberately crass. To wit: Seems the editors of the Daily Press thought it best to accompany their article about the graduate student beheaded with a kitchen knife with a photo-essay about professional knife sharpeners sharpening kitchen knives. Not that they shouldn’t run a photo-essay about one of the few growth industries we have left—but you think someone on the editorial staff would consider not linking to this particular photo-essay from this particular article. (x-posted.)</span></a></div>

Do not be excessive.</strong> All the crying and crowing over the death of Pajamas Media overshadowed the birth of the awesomeness that is Pajamas Television. Just today I watched Glenn Reynolds, Michelle Malkin, and the Artisan Formerly Known as Joe the Plumber discuss the first weeks of the Obama administration. They showed behind-the-scenes footage of the Daschle debacle: They laughed ha ha while the tape ran. Then Reynolds showed it again ha ha. Malkin said it was distracting ha ha. Reynolds asked how that got in there again ha ha. Is that the Obama administration or a car full of clowns ha ha. Who can tell ha ha. Because being on the cutting edge of political commentary entails airing footage of a clown car while the contemporary equivalent of “Bag of Rags” blares. I couldn’t watch much more than the first five minutes—I kept waiting for Reynolds to pull a full Saget and show Obama getting beaned in the privates by a baseball. But I saw enough to capture the new face of serious journalism in all its seriousness: Pajamas Television: where you can watch a middle-aged man put every ounce of the fiber of his being into nailing a lick on his air guitar. Serious journalism for serious people ha ha.</span></a></div>
