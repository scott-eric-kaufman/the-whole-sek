			After I linked to <a href="http://patterico.com/2009/08/29/words-fail/">his post</a>
about Ted Kennedy’s funeral, Patrick asked what I’d think were the
grandchild of a hypothetical conservative to say this at the funeral:
<blockquote><p>Dear God, for what my grandpa called the causes of his
life, the privatization of social security and the construction a
robust missile defense shield, we pray to the Lord.</p></blockquote>
<p>My response, as indicated by the title, is that funerals are about
the lives of the deceased, and if the deceased was a Senator who
devoted his life to privatizing social security and constructing a
robust missile defense shield, I’d have no problem with those issues
being raised at his funeral. But it would sound tacky, not because
I disagree with those policy initiatives, but because this hypothetical
conservative dedicated his life to wonky policy initiatives. Were those
initiatives less wonky, the prayer would sound less tacky. Consider:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear God, for what my grandpa called the cause of his life, the eradication of hunger in Africa, we pray to the Lord.</p></blockquote>
<p>When prayed for, big and noble causes sound big and noble. So, too,

Consider:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear God, for what my grandpa called the cause of his
life, the preservation of the Santa Ana sucker fish habitat, we pray to

<p>Praying for the preservation of a land and species to which the
deceased felt great affinity sounds respectable, if a bit silly,
because of our reverence for outdoorsmen like Henry David Thoreau and
John Muir, who are themselves respectable, if a bit silly. The more
wonkish the issue to which the deceased committed his life, the more
likely it is that intercessionary prayers on his or her behalf will
sound tacky. But as it was the deceased who chose to devote his or her
life to an issue that will make for some tacky intercessionary prayers,
the living can do precious little if they wish to remain respectable.</p>
<p>If I spent my life rewriting the tax code, and if, on my deathbed,
the rewriting of the tax code was imminent, I would hope that my
relatives thought enough of me to say a prayer on my behalf that
represented my fondest desire at my funeral. It would sound tacky, <em>but so what</em>?
My funeral should be about me, my life, my accomplishments, and my
dreams, and if I wore a grey flannel suit, amended the tax code around
the edges, and dreamt of a complete overhaul, I would hope that my
friends and family would mention it, what with it having been so
important to me.</p>

<blockquote><p>The profound principles associated with his name will
not fade away. Rather, I would predict that in the time ahead those
principles of respect for law, order, and justice will come to govern
our national life more completely than ever before. Because the trend
of permissiveness in this country, a trend which Edgar Hoover fought
against all his life, a trend which was dangerously eroding our
national heritage as a law-abiding people, is now being reversed.</p>
<p>The American people today are tired of disorder, disruption, and
disrespect for law. America wants to come back to the law as a way of
life, and as we do come back to the law, the memory of this great man,
who never left the law as a way of life, will be accorded even more
honor than it commands today.</p>
<p>In times past, in the days of the American frontier, the brave men
who wore the badge and enforced the law were called by a name we do not
often hear today. They were called peace officers. Today, though that
term has passed out of style, the truth it expressed still endures. All
the world yearns for peace, peace among nations, peace within nations.
But without peace officers, we can never have peace. Edgar Hoover knew
this basic truth. He shaped his life around it. He was the peace
officer without peer.</p>
<p>The United States is a better country because this good man lived
his long life among us these past 77 years. Each of us stands forever
in his debt. In the years ahead, let us cherish his memory. Let us be
true to his legacy. Let us honor him as he would surely want us to do,
by honoring all the men and women who carry on in this noble profession
of helping to keep the peace in our society.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m sure conservatives will point out that it’s not the same, because like there was no debate of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1972">national importance</a> abuzz when Nixon delivered his encomium to law and order on May 2, 1972.</p><p>(<em><a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/08/31/the-content-of-a-eulogy-is-a-function-of-the-life-being-eulogized/">x-posted</a></em>.)</p>

He accuses Michiko Kakutani of plagiarizing his 2008 blockbuster, &quot;The Improvised Odyssey of Barack Obama,&quot; and begins his defense of this claim as one does: by demonstrating that William Ayers is familiar with Homer's Odyssey. Ayers knows his Homer. In his 2001 memoir, Fugitive Days, for instance, he specifically identified the Odyssey's &quot;Cyclops&quot; as a metaphor for the &quot;doomed and helpless&quot; United States. &quot;Picture an oversized, somewhat dim-witted monster, greedy and capricious,&quot; Ayers wrote in his uniquely patriotic way, &quot;its eyes put out by fiery stakes and now flailing in a blind rage, smashing its way through villages and over mountains.&quot; If, as Cashill hopes to establish, &quot;Ayers knows his Homer,&quot; it would behoove him not to quote Ayers saying that Odysseus put out the eyes of the famously one-eyed monster Polyphemus. That Ayers speaks of a stereoscopic cyclops speaks ill of him; that Cashill attempts to establish both his own and Ayers's classicist credibility via a quotation about a two-eyed cyclops only proves that neither should be trusted with Homeric parallels. (Leave that to the experts.) Then, as if he anticipated the complaint of the previous sentences, he politely offers evidence of their validity: In Dreams, Obama confronts his own menacing one-eyed bald man, a Savak-loving Iranian. Obama once spoke with a one-eyed man, Cashill argues, therefore this reference to a one-eyed cyclops in Dreams From My Father corresponds with Ayers's reference to a two-eyed one in Fugitive Days. Granted, my summary of his point may be uncharitably literal, even though Obama's one-eyed man had, to all appearances, two eyes (&quot;an older balding man with a glass eye,&quot; the &quot;drift of [which] gave the Iranian a menacing look&quot;); and even though the point of Obama telling this story is that, despite one of the man's two eyes giving him &quot;a menacing look,&quot; he &quot;was a friendly and curious&quot; person; and even though, unlike the Odyssey, in which the curse of the one-eyed cyclops Polyphemus results in his father, Poseidon, to unleash contrary winds and furious storms, thereby extending the travels and travails of Odysseus, all that resulted from this conversation was that someone else quoted Malcolm X; even though all those parallels break down, maybe I am being uncharitably literal. Once the sentence I quoted above is inserted back into its context, the parallels between Homer's epic and Obama's memoir become clear: In Dreams, Obama confronts his own menacing one-eyed bald man, a Savak-loving Iranian. Before he completes his heroic cycle, he also confronts many of the other distractions: green-eyed seductresses, blind seers, lotus-eaters, the &quot;ghosts&quot; of the underworld, whirlpools, and about a half dozen sundry &quot;demons.&quot; Obama, as scripted by Ayers, lived the most Odysseus-esque life of anyone ever. I never even knew he went to the underworld! But our President is even...</span></a></div>

I completed my Ph.D. in AWESOME at the University of California, AWESOME, where I specialized in AWESOME and AWESOMER. In addition to pursuing my interests in AWESOMENESS—the generic history of AWESOMER and AWESOMEST and the historical development of AWESOMOSITY—during my tenure at UC AWESOME, I cultivated other AWESOME interests that, over time, became EVEN AWESOMER. Early in my graduate career, I helped develop the AWESOME curriculum for the AWESOMEST undergraduate program in the UC system; more recently, my course director, Dr. AWESOME, invited me to coauthor a manuscript on AWESOME rhetoric for AWESOME Press. My effort to share, by teaching AWESOMELY, the complexities of an AWESOME discipline in an AWESOME manner dovetails with my desire to provide, by teaching EVEN MORE AWESOMELY, the critical tools required to understand an increasingly AWESOME world. Together, they point to my AWESOME commitment to the improvement of AWESOMENESS.</span></a></div>
