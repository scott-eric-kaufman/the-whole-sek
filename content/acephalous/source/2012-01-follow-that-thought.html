It's as if the camera's going to continue through his eyes and into his memory, which is why—as is the case here—such zooms are so often followed by a flashback: Call it an abuse of frontality—that feature of a frame that allows the audience to drink deeply of a character's eyes and acquire sympathy with or knowledge of what lies behind them—but it's really just an arbitrary convention. There's no logical reason zooming in on a face should signal the beginning of a flashback. But it frequently does. What's interesting about the opening title sequence of Fight Club is that it reverses the convention. Via CGI, the audience sees an idea—represented by an electric flash of blue light—form: The idea then travels around the brain: Until it punctures the skin on Edward Norton's forehead: And travels down the barrel of the gun Brad Pitt's holding in Norton's mouth before stopping at the sights: At which point Fincher racks the focus and provides the audience with an extreme close-up of Norton's face: Instead of zooming into an extreme close-up to flash back to a memory, Fincher opens the film by following a thought from its origin to an extreme close-up. Meaning that the title sequence and first scene work in tandem—thought-goes-out-to-camera and thought-goes-in-from-camera—to bookend that opening scene. Is this in any way significant or just Fincher being fancy to be fancy? Considering that the tandem of the opening sequence and the first scene structurely suggests that this is all in Edward Norton's head, I'm tempted to argue the former. That said, the signal that weaves through the opening credits is an untranslated thought: it can be any neuronal transmission relevant to Norton's current predicament. The audience can only infer its content from its timing, which means it could be, to name but two examples, Norton's decision to stick the gun in his mouth or the fear of what he'll do with it once there. In short, Fincher's credit sequence undermines the logic of the very convention he employs to transition from the first scene to the flashback." />

<p>The opening credit sequence in <em>Fight Club </em>is a nifty little reverse-literalization of a common directorial device for representing thought on screen. The technique typically works in the manner it does at the end of the film&#39;s first scene. Start with a medium close-up of a face:</p>
<div class="photo-wrap photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffafd5c3970d" id="photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffafd5c3970d" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 500px;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffafd5c3970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Fight club2012-01-11-14h02m31s183" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffafd5c3970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffafd5c3970d-500wi" title="Fight club2012-01-11-14h02m31s183" /></a></div>
<p>Note that the narrator indicates that he&#39;s had a revelation. The camera supports his claim by zooming into a close-up:</p>
<div class="photo-wrap photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e5a585c6970c" id="photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e5a585c6970c" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 500px;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e5a585c6970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Fight club2012-01-11-14h02m34s212" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e5a585c6970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0168e5a585c6970c-500wi" title="Fight club2012-01-11-14h02m34s212" /></a></div>
<p>&#0160;Then into an extreme close-up:</p>

<p>By zooming in on his face, David Fincher indicates that the audience is about to enter his mind. It&#39;s as if the camera&#39;s going to continue through his eyes and into his memory, which is why—as is the case here—such zooms are so often followed by a flashback:</p>

<p>Call it&#0160;<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/fight-club.html" target="_self">an abuse of frontality</a>—that feature of a frame that allows the audience to drink deeply of a character&#39;s eyes and acquire sympathy with or knowledge of what lies behind them—but it&#39;s really just an arbitrary convention. There&#39;s no logical reason zooming in on a face should signal the beginning of a flashback. But it frequently does.

<p>Until it punctures the skin on Edward Norton&#39;s forehead:</p>
<div class="photo-wrap photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffb00bef970d" id="photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffb00bef970d" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 500px;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffb00bef970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Fight club2012-01-16-13h41m27s67" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffb00bef970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffb00bef970d-500wi" title="Fight club2012-01-16-13h41m27s67" /></a></div>
<p>And travels down the barrel of the gun Brad Pitt&#39;s holding in Norton&#39;s mouth before stopping at the sights:</p>
<div class="photo-wrap photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffb00e35970d" id="photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffb00e35970d" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 500px;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffb00e35970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Fight club2012-01-16-13h41m39s184" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffb00e35970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffb00e35970d-500wi" title="Fight club2012-01-16-13h41m39s184" /></a></div>
<p>At which point Fincher racks the focus and provides the audience with an extreme close-up of Norton&#39;s face:</p>
<div class="photo-wrap photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffb0107f970d" id="photo-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffb0107f970d" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 500px;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffb0107f970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Fight club2012-01-16-13h41m42s213" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffb0107f970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0162ffb0107f970d-500wi" title="Fight club2012-01-16-13h41m42s213" /></a></div>
<p>Instead of zooming into an extreme close-up to flash back to a memory, Fincher opens the film by following a thought from its origin to an extreme close-up. Meaning that the title sequence and first scene work in tandem—thought-goes-out-to-camera and thought-goes-in-from-camera—to bookend that opening scene.</p>
<p>Is this in any way significant or just Fincher being fancy to be fancy?&#0160;Considering that the tandem of the opening sequence and the first scene structurely suggests that <em>this is all in Edward Norton&#39;s head</em>, I&#39;m tempted to argue the former. That said, the signal that weaves through the opening credits is an untranslated thought: it can be any neuronal transmission relevant to Norton&#39;s current predicament. The audience can only infer its content from its timing, which means it could be, to name but two examples, Norton&#39;s decision to stick the gun in his mouth or the fear of what he&#39;ll do with it once there. In short, Fincher&#39;s credit sequence undermines the logic of the very convention he employs to transition from the first scene to the flashback.&#0160;</p>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/01/im-a-woman.html"><span><strong>I'm a woman?</strong> Caitlin Flanagan seems to think so: The second reason Metcalf was left flat by this line of reasoning is that he isn’t a woman, and to really love Joan Didion—to have been blown over by things like the smell of jasmine and the packing list she kept by her suitcase—you have to be female. Admittedly, I don’t find Didion’s discussions of jasmine and packing lists to be the strongest features of her work. Even if I did, I wouldn’t have to be a woman to do so. Flanagan should know better than to argue from a gender essentialist position so intellectually vapid it can be refuted by the existence of stereotypical gay males. She clearly doesn’t. Her failure to recognize that she’s diminishing Didion by praising her thus leads her to statements like: Didion’s genius is that she understands what it is to be a girl on the cusp of womanhood, in that fragile, fleeting, emotional time that she explored in a way no one else ever has. Didion is, depending on the reader’s point of view, either an extraordinarily introspective or an extraordinarily narcissistic writer. As such, she is very much like her readers themselves. Calling the woman who wrote “Slouching Towards Bethlehem” a “girl” does her disservice. Calling her a narcissist and suggesting that any females who read her are similarly narcissistic does them a disservice. That Flanagan does this in an attempt to praise Didion renders it all the more appalling because, in the end, Flanagan doesn’t believe that Didion’s actually a writer: I can tell you this for certain: anything you have ever read by Didion about the shyness that plagued her in her youth, and about her inarticulateness in those days, in the face of even the most banal questions, was not a writer’s exaggeration of a minor character trait for literary effect. The contemporary diagnosis for the young woman at our dinner table would be profound—crippling—social-anxiety disorder. Didion emoted her prose onto the page. She didn’t perform an excruciating self-analysis in the service of a journalistic ethos, she was shy so she wrote shyly. The dinner party Flanagan recounts in the article happened after the publication ofSlouching Towards Bethlehem, a collection whose titular essay is renowned for its shy lyric: We were seeing the desperate attempt of a handful of pathetically unequipped children to create a community in a social vaccum. Once we had seen these children, we could no longer overlook the vacuum, no longer pretend that society’s atomization could be reveresed …. As it happens I am still committed to the idea that the ability to think for one’s self depends upon one’s mastery of language, and I am not optimistic about children who will settle for saying, to indicate that their mother and father do not live together, that they come from “a broken home.” They are sixteen, fifteen, fourteen years old, younger all the time, an army of children waiting to be given the words. Except there’s nothing shy about...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/01/who-does-newt-want-to-kill.html"><span><strong>Who does Newt want to kill?</strong> Last night's debate provided yet another example of Gingrich's firm grasp of history: We’re in South Carolina. South Carolina in the Revolutionary War had a young 13-year-old named Andrew Jackson. He was sabred by a British officer and wore a scar his whole life. Andrew Jackson had a pretty clear-cut idea about America’s enemies: Kill them. He was in South Carolina and had just related an anecdote about Andrew Jackson, so I can see why he'd quote Andrew as the Jacksonian source of the &quot;Kill them!&quot; quotation. Only Andrew Jackson didn't say it—Stonewall Jackson did. Accounts as to who he said it to vary, but the circumstances in which he said it don't. Union forces greatly outnumbered Southern forces at theBattle of Fredericksburg, and shortly after the death of Brigadier General Maxcy Gregg, someone asked Jackson how the Confederate forces could win. He responded Kill them, sir! Kill every man! Which, of course, refers to the Union soldiers. So America's enemies are, by Gingrich's account, other Americans. (Most likely Democrats.) There's the possibility that his error represents an eleventh dimensional dog-whistle blown for the benefit of the strong neo-Confederate presence in South Carolina, but I somehow doubt it.</span></a></div>
