		<span id="comment-85071116-content"><p>Technically, if you are editing &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down,&quot; you should perhaps be shaking it &quot;around.&quot; (I learned it as &quot;in,&quot; &quot;out,&quot; and &quot;about,&quot; however.)</p>

<p>I suffer from a similar malady. When I was applying to graduate school, some schools wanted a 20-page writing sample and some schools wanted a 10-page one. So for the latter group, I painstakingly and awkwardly edited down my 20-page chapter to 10 pages. Do you know how many of those 10-page schools I got into? Zero. Zip. Goose egg.</p>

<p>(I&#39;ve got my quals in 2 weeks, so I won&#39;t be able to make it to your panel; I hope it goes well!)</p></span>

However, Kaufman hates writing short biographies, because every word he writes about himself seems to consist of 49 percent braggadocio, 49 percent false humility and 2 percent error. He believes the readers of his blog, Acephalous, could write him a biography which contains no braggadocio, actual humility and even more hilarious error. All are welcome to apply. If none of his readers take him up on his offer, he has pledged to embarrass them permanently when they least suspect it. Earlier victims rave about the quality embarrassment he provides: &quot;I didn't—I couldn't—leave the house for months,&quot; raved one visibly shaken woman. &quot;How am I ever going to look my wife in the eye again?&quot; raved a trampled man. &quot;I thought I'd recovered,&quot; raved an old-souled young man. &quot;But then I saw the fabric softener, and it all came rushing back.&quot; &quot;The nightmares—they never said, never told me,&quot; raved a drooling senex. &quot;I still see the looks on their, in my dreams—when I sleep, when I close my—I see their faces, and I—their faces, then I ...&quot;</span></a></div>

It's me, Scott. Well, are you? Because I don't know want to know. I have quite a load to accomplish today, so I can't spend all day talking to you. Therefore, I hereby declare 4 October 2007 the Great Mofo Delurk Day. Do you have something to say? Keep it to yourself. Because I'm not listening. Can't be be bothered. Too much to do, too little time. All you lurkers: keep on keeping on. The rest of you—you know who you are—need to put a lid on, stuff a sock in or zip the proverbial it. I'm trying to work here. (Getting a haircut qualifies as work, since it's a pre-presentation haircut and I need to look, you know, presentable.)</span></a></div>
