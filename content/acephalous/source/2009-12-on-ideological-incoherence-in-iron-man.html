        <meta name="description" content="I feel vindicated by the revelation that Iron Man went into production without a shooting script, if only because now I know the reason Robert Downey Jr. had so few quality lines is that he and director Jon Favreau were making up the dialogue as they went along. This approach works when you can endlessly re-shoot uninspired or botched takes on the cheap, i.e. when you're not filming a $200 million film on someone else's dime. Favreau delivered all that could be expected working under such constraints: a serviceable plot that relies heavily on the many charms of its actors and the explosiveness of its explosions. The lack of a shooting script accounts for the ideological incoherence of the film Spencer Ackerman noted shortly after its release. It is difficult for any film to have a singular vision in an age of studio-groomed auteurs and homogenizing test audiences, so one in which there is no script is bound to wander off the message it never had. No matter how much attention Downey Jr. and Favreau paid to the lines to be delivered on a given day, they had no written substrate on which to base their improvisations. There are no lines that resonate outside the immediate moment in the film because no one sat down and labored over the text in the manner required to create such resonance. In short, the ideological incoherence of Iron Man can be attributed to the material conditions of its production. The same cannot be said of The Dark Knight. Its ideological incoherence is a function of its script ... as I will discuss at some length in a forthcoming post in which I demonstrate that the film is all about dogs." />

<p>As a fellow <em>Iron Man</em> non-devotee, I can only say what I&#39;ve picked up from reading Favreau claim that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimates" rel="nofollow"><em>The Ultimates</em></a> version of Iron Man was the source material for the film ... in which case, you can catch up quickly and see that there is, in fact, a very clear ideological agenda behind this version of Stark.  The thing is, even if that is the version the character&#39;s based on, it&#39;s difficult to say anything definitive because of the amount of on-the-fly emendations they performed.  I&#39;ve actually got a much bigger argument to make here (as you can probably guess from the last few sentences of the first paragraph) concerning the consistency and texture of a work, but I want to hold out until I discuss <em>The Dark Knight</em>, which I believe was deliberately incoherent, because such incoherence befits a film in which the Alan Moore/Heath Ledger version of the Joker is its center of gravity.</p></span>

He says that it, too, was being written as it was shot, but he claims that some of its good features (or at least, the characteristics that make it what it is, and a potential cult film) arise from the resulting incoherence.  </p>

<p>(Sorry, not sure if Eco would be either someone you would obviously have read, or someone you wouldn&#39;t possibly have any interest in reading.)</p></span>

<p>And I can&#39;t take seriously the claim that the movie&#39;s Tony Stark was derived from Orson Scott Card&#39;s precocious (and cancerous) thrill-seeker.  He strikes me as being much more like the original character, and thank Ghu for that.</p>

<p>But what I really can&#39;t forgive the film for is that it didn&#39;t have a proper place for the classic rock song (which, not actually being about Tony Stark, would not have threatened the fourth wall), since it worked so well in the first movie trailer.</p></span>

<p>Absolutely, Hugh!  In point of fact, I teach <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/myth-of-superma.html" rel="nofollow">this essay every quarter</a>.  I&#39;m not sure about the <em>Casablanca</em> written-on-the-fly legend, though, because the problem wasn&#39;t that they had no script, but that they had the original play, <em>Everybody Comes to Ricks</em>, and two script treatments (the Epstein brothers and Koch) competing for supremacy.  They had two many scripts, which, you could say, is worse than having none at all.</p>

<p><em>I always thought that Iron Man was one of the more ideologically clear characters, at least as originally conceived: Howard Hughes in powered armor.</em></p>

<p>But &quot;Howard Hughes in powered armor&quot; itself a pretty ideologically loaded set-up?  Especially as concerns the relationship of the military to its industrial partners?  </p></span>

I say this not because Adam's a personal friend (although he is), and not because I've edited some of his other novels (although I have), but because it actually is the most intriguing novel I've read this year. Admittedly, I can't say whether it's the best novel published in 2009, because I only read three novels published this year (The City and the City, Inherent Vice, and Asterios Polyp), so I'm limited to saying that Yellow Blue Tibia merely outpaces the latest by Mieville and Pynchon, as well as David Mazzucchelli's decade-in-the-making masterpiece. A quick plot summary before moving on to what makes the book sing. In 1946, Josef Stalin ordered Konstantin Skvorecky, Ivan Frenkel, and a few other Russian science fiction writers to create a new threat against which the Soviet people could unite (as they had against Germany). They concoct a plot in which invisible radiation aliens invade the U.S.S.R., but it opens when &quot;The Americans launch a rocket to explore space [and the] aliens destroy it with a beam of focused destructive radiation ... Then the aliens blow up a portion of the Ukraine, and poison the ground with radiation&quot; (25). Before they can sketch the invasion out in greater detail, Stalin disbands the group. Years pass. Frenkel accidentally reconnects with Skvorecky shortly before the Challenger disaster. The plan they concocted for Stalin seems to be coming true. Skvorecky, a translator, meets two American scientologists and a Muscovite taxi driver named Ivan Saltykov. There is a murder. Someone or something threatens Chernobyl. Love happens. That is not, I grant, the most conventional summary of the novel—if they're more your bag you can try here, here or here, or if you're feeling more adventurous, here—but for me to say more would not despoil the novel so much as ruin the pleasure afforded by Adam's narrative gamesmanship. I'm more than happy to spoil a simple plot point, but I would prefer to avoid ruining the interpretive tension created by the contradictory accounts of those simple plot points. Were I to concretize any one of them, I would not only be usurping the role of a character within the novel, I would be reproducing the book's ingenious structural conceit. Unlike a A Scanner Darkly, in which conflicting realities are focalized through the muddle of drug-induced paranoia, the narrator of Yellow Blue Tibia is fully aware that he lives in a world structured by other people's understanding of reality. From the obsessive-compulsive taxi driver, Ivan Saltykov, who returns to the scene of the crime because he must retrace his path exactly, to the UFO enthusiasts who mistake Skvorecky's denial of the existence of extraterrestrials for an exercise in dialectical thinking, the characters in the novel influence the narrative less through their actions than their rationale for engaging in them. Dramatic irony is...</span></a></div>
