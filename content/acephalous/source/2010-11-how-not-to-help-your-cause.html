<p>Your eyes don&#39;t deceive you: the argument is, in fact, that <em>criticizing</em> Glenn Beck would &quot;collapse any credibility [I] may have among those whose good graces [I] desire to be in.&quot;&#0160; Because we all know left-leaning academics who criticize far-right lunatics are shunned by their colleagues.&#0160; Further depressing my credibility is my intellectual honesty, which here takes the form of my admission, up front, that I&#39;m not a regular viewer of the show.&#0160; Note, though, that the claim is that I admitted a &quot;profound ignorance on what Beck ever says,&quot; which is strange because I did no such thing.&#0160; I wrote:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">See, what Glenn has said in the past about the Chinese is that unlike  us, they plan waaaaay far ahead. They have contingency plans and stuff.  And they’re looking to achieve hegemony in Asia and maybe more. Glenn  has NEVER said that the Chinese plan to invade the U.S.</p>
<p>So his fear-mongering concerning the Chinese is related to their desire to &quot;achieve hegemony in Asia and maybe more.&quot;&#0160; That&#39;s some non-ominous &quot;maybe more&quot; there, and the fact that it didn&#39;t issue from his mouth only makes my point stronger: he&#39;s inculcated his Fear of a Yellow Planet in his audience so successfully that<em> even when they attempt to claim that his fears are fact-based and rational</em> the fruits of his irrational speculation appear.&#0160; To wit:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Glenn has expressed this fear for a long time. He posits that a lot of  powerful radicals, financed by Soros cash, are counting on Obama to  fulfill their political wish list, but that if he proves to be unable or  unwilling to do so, they’ll take him out.</p>
<p>Claiming that he&#39;s &quot;posit[ed]&quot; something sans evidence for &quot;a long time&quot; doesn&#39;t disprove my argument that he engages in irresponsible apocalyptic speculation, it merely extends its provenance.&#0160; Put differently: &quot;Glenn Beck can&#39;t be saying crazy things now because he&#39;s said these same crazy things before&quot; is a laughably weak defense <em>because it admits the very thing it wants to deny</em>. The rest of the &quot;refutation&quot; works according to similarly unsound logic.&#0160; For example, mind-reading:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Scott has never heard Glenn talk about “Dreams from My Father,”  wherein he shows how Obama’s father dreamed of establishing a Marxist  government in Kenya, among other far-left goals, and how Obama  identifies with those dreams and seeks to carry on his father’s project.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t?&#0160; Doesn&#39;t matter.&#0160; Why doesn&#39;t it matter?&#0160; Because Marxism isn&#39;t heritable and people who think otherwise think crazy-thoughts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nor did Scott see Glenn’s three-part series on George Soros:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">10 Nov 2010: <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,602142,00.html">The Puppet Master</a><br /> 11 Nov 2010: <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,602143,00.html">Five Step Plan</a><br /> 12 Nov 2010: <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,602163,00.html">Making of the Puppet Master</a></p>
<p>I didn&#39;t?&#0160; It doesn&#39;t matter.&#0160; Why doesn&#39;t it matter?&#0160; Because if you follow those links all you&#39;ll find is more madness couched in bed-wetting rhetoric.&#0160; For example, Soros</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">has focused his attention. This isn&#39;t a hypothesis. This has  been proven. This is what this man does. He has done it before and now,  he wants orderly decline of the dollar—his words, not mine.&#0160; If you thought $5 or $4 a gallon gas is painful, wait until  Soros devalues your dollar even more. Forget driving. How about eating?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We told you just recently, I told you this for, what, two years  now? That they would devalue the dollar and that inflation would come.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&quot;Financial Times&quot; reported it today. It&#39;s about to be added to  your grocery bill. And if you&#39;re the one in the household doing the  grocery shopping, you&#39;ve already seen it. But, oh, you haven&#39;t seen  nothing yet.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As they devalue the dollar, in orderly decline, you will start  to see prices like one group—inflation group predicted that it will  soon cost<br /> $11—$11.43 for an ear of corn. One ear.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How about going to the grocery store and seeing a price tag on loaf of wheat bread of $23.05?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This sugar, this size, 32 ounces of sugar—$62.21.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For the milk, good old soy milk—I mean, who doesn&#39;t—smooth and delicious, $24.31 for this size.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For a container of this coffee, Folgers, 11 1/2 ounces, $77.71.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For a container of orange juice, not this size but for 64  fluid ounces, Minute Maid orange juice, they are now saying it will be  $45.71.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And one thing I couldn&#39;t believe and we called the experts and  ask them, OK, please tell me that the institute on inflation is nuts.  No. No, no. They&#39;re not, unfortunately.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I couldn&#39;t believe that one candy bar, one Hersey&#39;s milk chocolate candy bar, 1 1/2 ounces, Hershey&#39;s milk chocolate, $15.50.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This, Mr. Soros, is not a game—at least not for the shlubs  outside of your world. I don&#39;t know anybody inside the world of George  Soros. Well, you&#39;ve got Timothy Geithner. You have Ben Bernanke. You  have most of the politicians in Washington.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We are the ones who are going to risk in this game. When he  manages the decline of our dollar, him and his minions in Washington,  who do think pays the price? Will it be him? Or will it be you?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You see, he knows what&#39;s coming. And because of that, he can  hedge. He knows exactly where to go. He knows where the exits are. And  he&#39;s done it over and over again.</p>
<p>How is that <em>not </em>fear-mongering?&#0160; Because if claiming that food will be too expensive to eat for everyone except millionaires and Washington power-brokers isn&#39;t<em> </em>fear-mongering, then I don&#39;t know what is.&#0160; The response will be that it&#39;s <em>informed </em>fear-mongering, which would be a valid defense except for the fact that it isn&#39;t informed.&#0160; For example:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And also why he cites the very similar dreams of Jay Rockefeller’s left-wing father.</p>
<p>David Rockefeller <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rockefeller" target="_self">isn&#39;t Jay&#39;s Rockefeller&#39;s father</a>, thereby undermining the &quot;logic&quot; of basing a conspiracy on the title of Obama&#39;s autobiography.&#0160; That said &quot;logic&quot; was there to be undermined in the first place points to the vapidity of Beck&#39;s associative argument style.&#0160; It <em>looks </em>like an argument even if it isn&#39;t informed like one:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Glenn peddles in THE UNKNOWN?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Are you HIGH?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What the hell do you think all that blackboard scrawling was about?</p>
<p>This is a perfect example of what I implied in the previous post: Beck&#39;s convinced his audience that lines on a chalkboard have the force of logic.&#0160; Those lines only indicate a nebulous (if even that) connection between the figures dotted on either end of them, but because they are <em>LINES </em>and there are <em>DOLLAR SIGNS </em>near them, his audience is convinced they must be meaningful.&#0160; That one of those dots is <a href="http://s3.mediamatters.org/static/video/2009/09/21/beck-20090921-consp.jpg" target="_self">invariably ACORN</a> escapes notice because he&#39;s convinced his audience that the reach of The Most Powerful Man In The World extends down to small-potato community organization groups <em>and </em>that believing that isn&#39;t a sign of conspiratorial thinking.&#0160;</p>
<p>Except that it is.&#0160; When such thinking is latched to devoting entire shows to canning your own food, you&#39;ve got apocalyptic rhetoric in full-effect.&#0160; That&#39;s why this is ridiculous:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Scott also doesn’t know that Glenn frequently telegraphs what he’ll be  doing in future shows, and so his stopping short was not to frighten us  through omission but to <em>save that stuff for later</em>.</p>
<p>I know what a &quot;tease&quot; is, and in the original post, I was noting the particular synergy at work with this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People fear what they don’t know,  especially when they’re being told,  in ominous tones, that the unknown  requires preparation and is  connected, somehow, to the “shadowy” or  “spooky” forces of the One  World Government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything after the word &quot;especially&quot; is, it goes without saying, especially important.&#0160; Then again, every word in this post should go without saying, and yet ...&#0160;</p>

But when an old friend, someone I genuinely respect, forwarded me a link to Beck’s archive and dared me to refute his logic, I decided it might be time to try. Bad decision. As someone who’s studied linguistics and taught journalism, I know that spoken language differs significantly from written and resist judging speakers for not speaking in complete sentences or organizing their thoughts into coherent paragraphs. That said, it should still possess some underlying logic, which is why this transcript from his November 19th program requires an airing out. It begins by preying on lunatic fears of a One World Government: I have a little bug inside of me, too, and it wants to stop control-hungry progressives from running our lives and pushing us into a giant global system of government. You know, the kind of global government that [Jay Rockefeller's] dad liked so much. [David Rockefeller] was a globalist and had a wonderful vision of the future of our world. Then, just in case his audience was insufficiently terrified: I feel a little uncomfortable. We’ll talk about preparing for—let’s just leave it at that, being prepared. Note how, in a classic bit of demagoguery, he stops himself just short the moment of revelation. People fear what they don’t know, especially when they’re being told, in ominous tones, that the unknown requires preparation and is connected, somehow, to the “shadowy” or “spooky” forces of the One World Government. Those adjectives don’t appear in that particular quotation, but they appear later, and frequently, especially with regards to: George Soros, [whose] daddy was a globalist as well. He believed in something called Esperanto. Esperanto is a made up language. It was designed for a one world government. It started in the 1890s, 1880s. And he was fluent in it. I mean, he wrote a book in Esperanto for one world government. Later, George Soros started his Open Society Institute. The main goal of the Open Society Institute was really that of his father’s: to create a world free of nationalities—one world government. I knew, in the vague way that everyone who follows politics knows, that Beck believes that lines on a chalkboard have the force of logic. I did not, however, appreciate that he was trafficking in full-throated conspiracy theories about the imminent invasion of the forces of the One World Government. Put differently, I expected to find moments, like the following, in which Beck discovered in the world connections that only exist in his head: Soros explains the anti-capitalist, pro-Marxist tactics he uses to fundamentally transform countries. They are the dreams of his father—which is weird because that’s almost the title of Barack Obama’s book, The Dreams From My Father. His daddy, by all accounts was a communist, at least an anti-colonialist, as was his grandfather. The apple doesn’t fall...</span></a></div>

Feel better? Me too. Next, pour a cup of water in the sauce-pan and bring it to a boil. Place the metal bowl on top of it and add 1) about half the chocolate, 3) the vanilla extract, and 3) enough of your favorite dessert liquor to cover it. Stir it and let your makeshift double-boiler melt the chocolate into the liquor. Take the melted chocolate mixture and add it to the fucking tofu. Add about half the honey and blend until it's thoroughly mixed. Use the rest of the honey to regulate the consistency. (Think pourable pudding.) Pour the mixture into the pie crust. If you'd like to make your own crust, you can. (I can't. I've ruined many a fine filling by pouring it into a tragedy of a from-scratch crust.) Place in the refrigerator for a few hours. Remove from the refrigerator and amaze everyone with the quality cheesecake you just made. They'll be genuinely impressed so long as you don't tell them what's in it. *I meant to make this a series, but then again, I've meant to write a lot of things I've never gotten around to writing, so there you go. **Myself included.</span></a></div>
