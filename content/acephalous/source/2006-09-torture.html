			<p>In his 1892 <em>American Anthropologist </em><a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-7294%28189207%291%3A5%3A3%3C193%3ATLOTAS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-L">article</a>, James Welling observes &quot;that the employment of torture as an engine of justice belongs to an advanced stage of mental evolution&quot; (194).&nbsp; &quot;Advanced,&quot; that is, when compared to judicial ordeal, such as</p><blockquote><p>a wager of battle between the litigant parties; trial as to which of two or more parties can longest hold the arms extended in the form of a cross; which can thrust the arm with impunity in water boiling hot; which shall sink and which shall float when cast into pool or stream with the hands and feet appropriately tied—the right hand to the left foot, the right foot to the left hand; which shall walk over burning ploughshares, laid at irregular intervals on the ground, and escape with the soles of the feet unscathed; which shall pass through fire and flame with limbs unscorched, &amp;c. (193)</p></blockquote><p>Compared to <em>that</em>, torture represents an advance.&nbsp; One from which we, as Americans, backslid.&nbsp; Over the past six years, we have come back to the fold.&nbsp; First, we re-familiarized ourselves with and re-desensitized ourselves to the trials <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FDE5TY/diesekoschmar-20">competitive humiliation</a>.&nbsp; The stakes may have been lower, but our hearts were pure and the ratings were fantastic.&nbsp; Slowly, however, it lost its appeal.&nbsp; Didn't matter how irregularly they laid the burning ploughshares on the ground.&nbsp; They could've tied one litigant's right foot to the other's left hand, set them on fire, threw them in a pool or stream, fished them out and saw whose <em>rigor </em>more closely resembles a crucified Christ <em>and we still would've flipped to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000B837XI/diesekoschmar-20">something else</a> </em>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>However loosely defined, judicial trial didn't cut it anymore.&nbsp; We knew we wanted something else.&nbsp; Something more <em>advanced</em>.&nbsp; So, in full compliance with the law of social evolution, we had no choice but to re-advance our backwards, backslid backsides. </p>

<p>Initially, and to the annoyance of many, we <a href="http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=286#comment-2073">niggled</a> like our more advanced forebears, drawing &quot;fine-spun distinctions&quot; left, right and Right:</p><blockquote><p>while the intervals between no proof at all and a proof half complete, or between a proof half complete and a proof complete, [distinctions] were graduated into still more spectral segments of proof, such as proof less than complete, but nearer complete than half complete; proof less than complete, but further from complete than half complete; <em>probatio</em> which might be rated with its evanescent values from <em>bona </em>to <em>optima</em>, from <em>evidens </em>to <em>evidentissima</em>, from <em>aperta </em>to <em>apertissima</em>, from <em>dubia </em>to <em>indubitata</em>, from <em>idonea</em>, <em>legitimata</em>, and <em>sufficiens </em>through all the ascending scales of the evidential gamut to <em>liquida</em>, <em>dilucida</em>, <em>perspicua</em>, <em>luce meridiana</em>, <em>clarior</em>, &amp;c., &amp;c. (196)</p></blockquote><p>Our ancestors probably didn't know how easy it would be for terrorists to stuff a dirty bomb in an <em>et cætera</em>.&nbsp; Had they, there wouldn't have been any trifling with &quot;proofs less than half complete, but to closer to half incomplete than half complete depending on the curve.&quot;&nbsp; They would have known that expediency demanded, and would settle for no less than, &quot;proof now.&quot;&nbsp; Who has time to fiddle with veracity when <em>there's a bomb in that kid!&nbsp; </em>(&quot;We're truth-seeking and he ain't truth-speaking,&quot; says the dashing hero, pointing an unsteady finger at the babbling infant.)&nbsp; Our decision to dispense with fussiness of Sebastian Guazzini's ponderous <em>Tractatus ad Defensam Inquisitorum, Carceratorum, Reorum et Condemnatorum super Quocunque Crimine </em>(1612) would be applauded.</p>

<p>They wouldn't have minded the elimination of unmanly &quot;legal prerequisites for torture&quot; restraining the when, where, why and how high we amp the 'trodes.&nbsp; Nor would they have cared that judges wouldn't face public reckoning when they couldn't demonstrate that all &quot;forty-three indications for torture&quot; have been met, appealed, re-presented, and re-appealed in a legally transparent manner.&nbsp; That's the kind of backward-thinking forethought you'd expect from some inquisitor in 1612, but you and I both know Guazzini'd race us to water-boarding chamber first chance he got.&nbsp; </p>

<p>After all, he's not <em>that </em>different from the guys who want to pick up his baton and beat the truth from someone with it:</p><blockquote><p>The seventh requisite is that inspection be made of the person of the accused, to ascertain whether he is privileged or not, because a privileged person cannot be tortured even with legitimate presumptions precedent.

I remember writing a failed pantoum a year or so ago that (annoyingly grating-righteous) used &quot;We burned the city on the hill&quot;, and no one in the group that I read it to recognized the reference -- at least, they asked which city I meant, and I had to explain the whole thing.</p>

<p>Well, now that I&#39;ve looked up the poem, I see that it fits your theme of ever-returning, Scott.  So here it is, a failed poem for a failed age:</p>

<p><br />
The Beacon</p>

<p>America calls to you<br />
Join in our common nightmare<br />
Old things again are new<br />
There are many good reasons for prayer</p>

<p>Join in our common nightmare<br />
It all comes around again<br />
There are many good reasons for prayer<br />
Our jails are examples to men</p>

<p>It all comes around again<br />
Through collateral damage still<br />
Our jails are examples to men<br />
We burned the city on the hill</p>

<p>Through collateral damage still<br />
The blood will wash away<br />
We burned the city on the hill<br />
We&#39;ll destroy evil someday</p>

<p>The blood will wash away<br />
Old things again are new<br />
We&#39;ll destroy evil someday<br />
America calls to you</p></span>

Dissertation Fear #2: What you're writing is stupid and someone else said it first. Dissertation Fear #3: What you're writing is stupid, someone else said it first and the both of you are wrong. Dissertation Fear #4: What you're writing is stupid, someone else said it first, the both of you are wrong and they're all laughing at you. Dissertation Fear #5: What you're writing is stupid, someone else said it first, the both of you are wrong and they'd all be laughing at you if they deigned to read your writing, or it ever crossed their radar, in the first place. Dissertation Fear #6: Everyone else already knows what you're writing about. Dissertation Fear #7: Everyone else thinks that what you're writing about is so obvious that they cannot even fathom how it possibly took you years to understand it. Dissertation fear #8: If you re-read your own work, you will discover you haven't been writing in complete sentences. Dissertation Fear #9: You know you're never going to make your deadline anyway, so why bother. Disseration Fear #10: Oh Jesus, you've even got writer's block trying to write about dissertation fears. Dissertation Fear #11: Your dissertation serves no useful social purpose. Dissertation Fear #12: When you look back at your dissertation later in life, you'll wonder why you spent the time of your (relative) youth doing that. Dissertation Fear #13: Since you've not really going to work in your field anyway, your dissertation will be the last thing you publish in that field. Which, face it, is pathetic. Dissertation Fear #14: Since you're not really going to work in your field anyway, your entire degree (as opposed to whatever you learned) is really of no more value than some business major's resume-stuffing MBA. However, yours is actually of less value, since a Ph.D. will *prevent* you from doing certain jobs. Dissertation Fear #15: This is not the end, but only the beginning. [context] Dissertation Fear #15.1: What you're writing is stupid; someone else said it first; and if you keep reading, you'll find out who. But if you keep reading, you'll never write. But if you write and someone's said it and you didn't know, you're an idiot. Because someone knows who said it, and if they haven't told you, it's because you've asked the question the wrong way. So you read. But you can't concentrate because you should be writing. Or submitting a proposal. Or finishing that cover letter so you can resubmit that paper. No, wait: if you just read this one last book, then you'll at least know that this author didn't say it. So you read. No, fuck it. You may as well write because then you can always revise out the idiotic part that someone (who?) already said. Unless someone already said it the same way you were gonna say it, in which case your whole project's worthless. Ergo, why write? So you read blogs. And...</span></a></div>

I'm not even sure how I'd turned it on, actually, but I'd noticed that whenever I added something to del.icio.us it ended up in my feed. So I figured out how to turn it off and did. Then—like Judd Nelson before the credits sapped the power from his fist of symbolic rebellion—Feedburner re-sent every del.icio.us link I'd ever saved. So, sorry for cluttering your RSS readers with junk you didn't want (and I didn't want to send) in the first place. Won't happen again. Also, what do you think of the &quot;preview&quot; function on Feedburner? It looks cleaner in my RSS reader, but if you prefer being able to read the entire post, I can switch back. After all, I don't need to read my feed ...</span></a></div>
