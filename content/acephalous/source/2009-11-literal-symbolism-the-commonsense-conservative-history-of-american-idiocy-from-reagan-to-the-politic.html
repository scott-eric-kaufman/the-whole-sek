        <meta name="description" content="The following exchange between Bill O'Reilly and Sarah Palin would, were we talking about any other politician, mark the end of a career. The emphasis is mine: PALIN: With Israel, we cannot get into Israel, for instance, and say we're going to tell you whether the Jewish community can expand or not expand within your borders. Instead, what we need to do is tell Israel that we will—we'll go to bat for them. O'REILLY: Well, what does that mean though? Look, say Israel, say Netanyahu says—calls you up and says, I'm bombing them, I'm bombing Iran, they're too close, I'm not going to let it happen. What do you say? You say go ahead, Netanyahu, go bomb them? What do you say? PALIN: Oh my gosh, any kind of war strike is the absolute last option. O'REILLY: All right, so you, you say no. PALIN: That anybody would … O'REILLY: But he's saying to you, you guys aren't going to be able to stop him. PALIN: That's why we cannot let the world get to the place that you're talking about right now. O'REILLY: Well, we're already there. PALIN: No, we're not. We're not quite there yet. There is still hope. But what we have to do is exert the pressure that America can put on our allies and on those who are not so friendly. O'REILLY: Obama says he's doing all that. PALIN: He's bowing to world leaders and I think any other president in our country … O'REILLY: Do you mean that literally, the Japanese emperor? PALIN: I mean that literally. O'REILLY: Do you think Obama's weak abroad? PALIN: I believe that his approach to diplomacy is not what history has shown us works. What works in my mind, reading the history book, is what Reagan did.As to the first embarrassment—her insistence that symbolic gestures are literal—all I can say is that I believe her. She honestly has no idea that she literalized a cliché and then condemned Obama on account of it. She honestly believes that Obama can no longer exert political pressure on reluctant allies because he bowed to the Japanese emperor. She sees not symbolism but causality there. That symbolic gesture is literal proof that Obama is not &quot;exert[ing] the pressure that America can put on our allies and on those who are not so friendly.&quot; The mind boggles.

embarrassment—her belief that there is one history book and it conforms

indicated an engagement with a scholarly community. It might be vague
(&quot;some have argued&quot;), or it might indicate ignorance of the larger
conversation (&quot;the only<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>book
I&#39;ve read on the subject&quot;), but it would acknowledge the existence of
competing ideas and conflicting opinions. Put differently: even <span style="font-style: italic;">Jonah Goldberg </span>talks this way. <br /><br />*That or no one told her Reagan isn&#39;t in the Bible.<br /><br />**The one exception would be Tom Tango, Mitchel Lichtman and Andrew Dolphin&#39;s <a href="http://www.insidethebook.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Book</span></a>
were the title itself not an arch reference to 1) conventional baseball
wisdom and 2) the decades the authors spent talking about their
unwritten book.

You guessed it! I spent the day marking papers, which, means I had, many reminders of why teaching Writingstudents, even at the Universitylevel, can make even the most mild-mannered academic want to JAB IN EYES JAB IN EYES. (Actual posts to recommence when the noises in my head resemble English more than English as she is spoke.) ALSO: Because it's always best to make this plain from the beginning [SEK says to the readers at LGM], on the issue of whether my students know what I'm writing: With the exception of the text adventure, [what I post is] written to be used in class, then repurposed for the blog. I show them videos of Shatner and ask them if that's what they want to sound like; I have them write blog posts (for their course blogs) in which they're required to substitute every noun and verb with suggestions from Microsoft Word's thesaurus, etc. Whenever I write about conversations in the classroom (for example), I ask the students if they're alright with that ... and as I'm typically the butt of those posts, they always are. In fact, by the end of the quarter, they're actually demanding I write up what happened in a given class (for example). Even the most notorious bit of student writing I've parodied was done with the student's consent. (It was years ago, and he wrote me out of the blue to apologize for writing it.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/11/you-dont-need-to-know-what-the-science-means-to-establish-what-the-words-means-to-scientists.html"><span><strong>You don't need to know what the science means to establish what the words mean to scientists.</strong> Global warming skeptics are attacking climate scientist Phil Jones for encouraging trickery in an email recently stolen off the webmail server at the University of East Anglia in which he wrote:I've just completed Mike's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) amd from 1961 for Keith's to hide the decline. Over at RealClimate, the skeptical response to the word &quot;trick&quot; is to treat it as a colloquial: Trick: “a cunning or deceitful action or device; “he played a trick on me”; “he pulled a fast one and got away with it” “Something designed to fool or swindle; ” “flim-flam: deceive somebody; “We tricked the teacher into thinking that class would be cancelled next week”To which one of the hosts, Gavin A. Schmidt, responds: Wrong. Wrong and wrong.The skeptics reply: [S]ince this happens “often”, it would be good to see a couple of examples of the word’s usage from other fields to understand why it is not problematic.Schmidt obliges: Sure. It's mostly used in mathematics, for instance in decomposing partial fractions, or deciding whether a number is divisible by 9 etc.etc.etc.The skeptics rejoinder: This is nonsense. Both are examples of teaching or explaining concepts to lay people. The first intentionally places “tricks” in quotations marks to emphasize its non-technical use.The problem with nonspecialists reading the private correspondence of experts is that their ignorance transforms all the technical points into nefarious inkblots. To continue with the example above, skeptical nonspecialists encounter the word &quot;trick&quot; and ask for clarification. Schmidt provides evidence that the word is innocuous, but because nonspecialists can interpret neither the context of the original nor that of the further examples, they redouble their efforts: now the rhetorical situation in which the word &quot;trick&quot; is uttered matters; now the appearance of quotation marks matters, etc. They are convincing themselves that those black blobs represent what they insist they represent, and when experts inform them that those are not Rorschach blots to be subjectively interpreted—that they are, in fact, statements written in a language that skeptics simply do not understand—the nonspecialists look over them again and declare that it could be a butterfly, or maybe a bat. To my mind, the only way to convince them that the word &quot;trick&quot; operates innocuously in the particular linguistic community of climate scientists would be to demonstrate that the word &quot;trick&quot; operates innocuously in the particular linguistic community of climate scientists. Show the skeptics that on 11 July 2001, Jean-Charles Hourcade wrote: This passes first through ... a macroeconomic framework insuring the consistency between prices and quantities at any point in time without necessarily resorting to the modeling tricks relying on the conventional neo-classical growth theory; these 'tricks' assume indeed perfect foresight, efficient markets and the absence of strategic or routine behaviours; new conceptual frameworks about endogenous growth theory allow for such a move, but there is a gap between advances in pure theory and empirical modeling[.]I don't know what that...</span></a></div>
