<p><strong>18 July 2005</strong></p>

<p>

A chunk of narration near the end of Wells' <em>War of the Worlds</em> has always bothered me.&nbsp; That same chunk of narration in Spielberg's <em><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/www.imdb.com/title/tt0407304">War of the Worlds</a></em> bothers me even more.&nbsp; 



</p>

<p>I haven't read Wells in years, but as I started working the
influence of evolutionary theory ca. 1890-1910, I realized I'd have to
account for <em>War of the Worlds</em>.&nbsp; After all, it's one of the few novels in which evolution <em>qua </em>evolution
wins.&nbsp; Pure and simple: the best laid plans of man and alien fall
before the unremitting logic of Darwinian adaptation.&nbsp; That's why the
inclusion of this passage--in the form of a voice-over by Morgan
Freeman--seems so, dare I say, conciliatory:</p><blockquote><p>And
scattered about it, some in their overturned war-machines, some in the
now rigid handling-machines, and a dozen of them stark and silent and
laid in a row, were the Martians--dead!--slain by the putrefactive and
disease bacteria against which their systems were unprepared; slain as
the red weed was being slain; slain, after all man's devices had
failed, by the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon
this earth.</p></blockquote><p>Spielberg, founding member of the Actual
Jewish Media Conspiracy (a.k.a. Dreamworks), kowtows to an increasingly
Christian marketplace of ideas by including that narration out of
context. </p>

<p>In the film, Tom Cruise and his daughter shack up wtih Tim Robbins,
a former ambulance driver.&nbsp; Robbins--like Cruise's son in the film--is
compelled by the need to do something to, well, do something.&nbsp; As the
aliens approach, Robbins becomes increasingly unstable, and so Cruise
must put him down.&nbsp; The scene works.&nbsp; The murder of Robbins the
ambulance driver--in addition to sounding like a Smiths'
B-side--expresses the limits to which Cruise will go to survive. 
However, Spielberg focuses entirely on the revelation of Cruise's
character--Robbins shuffles onstage, speaks bravely, cracks, and is
shuffled off--whereas Wells' focus is as much on the curate as the
unnamed (and decidedly less heroic) narrator.&nbsp; </p>

<p>That's right: I said <em>curate</em>.&nbsp; The criticism of the cloth in the novel is unmistakeable.&nbsp; To wit:</p><blockquote><p>At
Halliford I had already come to hate the curate's trick of helpless
exclamation, his stupid rigidity of mind. His endless muttering
monologue vitiated every effort I made to think out a line of action,
and drove me at times, thus pent up and intensified, almost to the
verge of craziness. He was as lacking in restraint as a silly woman. He
would weep for hours together, and I verily believe that to the very
end this spoiled child of life thought his weak tears in some way
efficacious. </p></blockquote><p>Once God abandons him, the curate's
&quot;stupid rigidity of mind&quot; becomes blinding, his lack of
restraint--appealing to the period's gender stereotypes--transforms him
into a little more than &quot;a silly woman.&quot;&nbsp; But here's the most damning
phrase, the one that puts the film's final theocentricism to lie: &quot;to
the very end this spoiled child of life thought his weak tears in some
way efficacious.&quot;&nbsp; Those &quot;weak tears&quot; poured forth from his eyes as the
words of the Lord, as supplications to God, poured forth from his
mouth.&nbsp; In the end, the narrator has to knock him unconscious lest he
witness Christ's love to the Martians:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I have been
still too long,&quot; he said, in a tone that must have reached the pit,
&quot;and now I must bear my witness. Woe unto this unfaithful city! Woe!
Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! To the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the
other voices of the trumpet----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shut up!&quot; I said, rising to my feet, and in a terror lest the Martians should hear us. &quot;For God's sake----&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nay,&quot; shouted the curate, at the top of his voice, standing
likewise and extending his arms. &quot;Speak! The word of the Lord is upon
me!&quot;</p>

<p>In three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen.</p>

<p>&quot;I must bear my witness! I go! It has already been too long delayed.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>By
the time the narrator utters that the Martians had been &quot;slain, after
all man's devices had failed, by the humblest things that God, in his
wisdom, put upon this earth,&quot; the efficacy of the appeal to God's love,
His wisdom, His Justice, &amp;c. have been undercut not only by the
ineffectiveness of the narrator's prayers--muttered as a dying
secularist hedging his bets--but also by the ineffectiveness of the
curate himself, his faith, his earnest prayer, not to mention his
eventual insanity.&nbsp; In Spielberg's film, the uncontextualized appeal to
God as Intelligent Designer undermines the importance of the
evolutionary narrative, of the (for its time) sophisticated
understanding of the relation of species to environs.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Furthermore, invest those final lines with theological relevance and
you create a conundrum: why did God, &quot;in his wisdom,&quot; create the
Martians who would put beneath this earth their tripodal molluscoid
human-evaporating machines?&nbsp; Why wouldn't he grant them immunity?&nbsp; And
really, have generations of humans suffered the common cold to protect
us from the possibility of God's great Martian experiment making its
way to Earth?&nbsp; In other words, a Christian walking away from the
Spielberg film finds his or her assumptions unchallenged.&nbsp; The same
cannot be said of a Christian who reads the novel.&nbsp; </p>

He breathes nuance into the word fug—Hey! Did you see that? I swear I saw him crack a smile. Look at him now! You can tell he wants to laugh. Why's he suppressing a smile? And—Wait! What's he looking at now? What's he spy over your right shoulder? Breathe deep and whatever you do don't turn around. Your ol' pal Nic' is winding you up is all. There's nothing there. Maybe you shouldn't have called him ugly. That was really uncalled for. Don't try to pin this on me! You earned your fate my friend. He didn't want this to happen to you. He thought you liked him. Thought the two of you could hang out and discover important stuff together. But you blew it. Talking about him behind his back. You should know better. Doesn't matter now though. Nothing you can do.

[UPDATED!] [AND AGAIN!]</strong> I normally avoid writing about such trivial stuff, but in addition to garden variety exhaustion I'm now running a fever. So the little things are getting to me. Like spam whose intention I can't fathom. I understand penis-enlargement spam. Plays off insecurities. Contains links to penis-enlargement pills. Makes sense. Weight-loss spam? Makes sense. Car insurance spam? Makes sense. &quot;Beaver in disloyalty kisses the drizzle's price&quot; spam? &quot;Beaver in disloyalty kisses the drizzle's price&quot; is all the email says. That's it. No link. Nothing. There's a point to the pointless of &quot;Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.&quot; Why would someone named &quot;point man&quot; want me to know what happens to those who are &quot;beaver&quot; in their disloyalty? Why would somone who is want to kiss &quot;the drizzle's price&quot;? Who is The Drizzle? What is his price? Do I only have to pay to kiss it if I'm beaver in disloyalty? Or is &quot;kissing the drizzle's price&quot; a euphemism for the dire fate of those who are beaver in their disloyalty? Maybe this is some sort of test. Maybe &quot;point man&quot; wants to know whether I'm beaver in disloyalty. Maybe this post proves that I am. Maybe it proves that I'm not. Hard to tell. [UPDATE: Since posting this I have received another email--this one from &quot;morgan bridges&quot; who wants me to know more about &quot;fanaticism dry cleaners.&quot; What more? &quot;Bash and nobody glimmers in the bridle of the creator.&quot;] [UPDATE II: Now &quot;harriot trent&quot; informs me of &quot;my raise.&quot; In the interest of fun I will render it in free verse form: shift. flap unwanted unmoved in the animated disruption. lip to! the quietness drifts heroic, too residual to adjourn, to subscribe to a lantern of estimation. the merry-go-round of influenza punctures all odd-jobs. catnap contentment, the soap opera errand. the sigh to commemorate what was Catholic, as the octopi gather verification to vandalize the &quot;v&quot; with illumination. I'm tempted to say that &quot;harriot trent&quot; is really Rich winding me up. Some of that's too evocative to be truly random.]</span></a></div>
