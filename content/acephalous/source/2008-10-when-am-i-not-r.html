<p>Really, you can pull stuff out of your ass and post it on your blog where your sycophants will believe anything, but you are full of shit claiming you read Paradise Lost in high school.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the rare high school that would have students read Paradise Lost in its entirety. If you read anything at all, you read maybe the first 100 lines or so of the first book, or maybe the entire first book if you were in an AP English class.</p>

<p>Stick to Pokemon and regurgitating GOP talking points, little man. In all other matters, you are way over your head. You&#39;re such a rube, you can&#39;t even lie credibly.</p></span>

(With luck it will be optioned.)</strong> Picture a boy playing with a toilet seat to no good end. His mother comes to rebuke him but his mother is not his mother! Remember Quantum Leap? This is exactly like that, except with a literary figure instead of Sam Beckett. (You know what I mean.) The literary figure inhabiting his mother's head? Edgar Allan Poe! Turns out that bloated fellow not wearing Poe's clothing wasn't Poe at all. Somehow or another, Poe had leapt forward in time into the boy's mother; and somehow or another, despite being all of two years old, he realizes this and screams, &quot;Mr. Poe! You are not my mother!&quot; Cut to the boy's 2nd grade play. His mother and father are in the crowd, and as he walks onstage dressed as Goofy, he spies his mother in the crowd only to find his mother is not his mother! She is Edgar Allan Poe! Again! The boy becomes flustered and nearly trips over his oversized shoes. His Poe-mother rushes the stage but the boy is already out the door and half-way down the hall. Years pass. His Poe-mother seems to have shook her Poe-self off. Until on the eve of his high school graduation, he looks across the kitchen table and realizes his mother is not his mother! She is Poe again! The boy darts from the table right into the sliding glass door. He regains consciousness sometime after midnight in the calm sterility of an American hospital. He finds this comforting until a figure emerges from a darkened corner. It's his Poe-mother! He tries to run but trips over the many wires glued and stuck into his parts. His Poe-mother approaches. He screams and— —and then I wake up. Why was Poe after me? Was he really after me? Or was it my mother he wanted all along? (Or a Freudian pun of such baleful provenance I deserve to be stabbed multiple times in painful places?)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/10/initial-debate.html"><span><strong>Initial debate impression</strong> Tonight the Republican Party outed itself as the proud parent of a C- student: Well, our founding fathers were very wise there in allowing through the Constitution much flexibility there in the office of the vice president. And we will do what is best for the American people in tapping into that position and ushering in an agenda that is supportive and cooperative with the president's agenda in that position. Yeah, so I do agree with him that we have a lot of flexibility in there, and we'll do what we have to do to administer very appropriately the plans that are needed for this nation. I admit: unedited transcripts make everyone sound like an idiot. However, so does sounding like an idiot. I'm with Burke and Bérubé on this one: she sounded like a student bluffing her way through an exam she crammed for three hours earlier. At times she was passable --- but only barely. She tacked back to her charted course five seconds into every answer, irrespective of the question, because she could only fit so much on those notecards the cameras didn't once catch her repeatedly shuffling through --- did I just call them notecards? I meant cheat sheets. Please, America, I beg of you: be as smart as the squiggly lines CNN had representing your core convictions are accurate. Live up to the ideals embodied by those squiggly lines our Founding Fathers.</span></a></div>
