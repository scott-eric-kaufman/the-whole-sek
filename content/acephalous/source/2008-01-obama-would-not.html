		<span id="comment-99510814-content"><p>To answer the Scrumptious question: yes.  From it&#39;s founding in 1847 until Samuel Doe took power in 1980, all of Liberia&#39;s president were Americo-Liberians.  Doe in turn was ousted by Charles Taylor, who was of mixed Gola and Americo-Liberian descent.  The country&#39;s current president, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, Africa&#39;s first elected female head of state, is not Americo-Liberian herself, but her family has been closely connected to the Americo-Liberian establishment and she earlier served in the administration of President William Tolbert, who Doe had killed.</p>

<p>So, really, elegant vagabonds aside, Sweden&#39;s got nothing.</p></span>

<p>Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, Harding, and Coolidge all arguably have &quot;one drop&quot; too.  (See J.A. Rogers, *Five Negro Presidents*, referenced comically in Reed&#39;s *Mumbo Jumbo*.)</p>

<p>And anyway, Bill Clinton is still the first black president.  So, if Sen. Clinton wins the election. he&#39;d more importantly become the first black First Lady.  </p></span>

So it should come as no surprise that when I started writing my Twain chapter, I sought out the two books Zwick had written on Clemens and anti-imperialism. He and I exchanged a few emails and he was aggressively generous, sending me copies of a numerous documents I was having trouble laying hands on. Tonight I read Shelley Fisher Fishkin's email to the Americanist listserv informing us that he had passed away. I never met him, and I only exchanged a handful of emails with him, but let me say this: He was generous when he didn't have to be. It may sound banal, but when you think about it, what better epitaph could a scholar wish for?</span></a></div>

Dearest Colleagues, Today on the Internet I found a very reputable site indicating that a medical procedure impossible to perform prior to the discovery of antibiotics in 1928 may have been widespread in Victorian England. I was wondering if members of the list could point me to scholarly books, articles, dissertations, abstracts, indexes, bibliographies, errata sheets or, alternatively, contemporary newspaper clippings, fictional accounts, poems, songs, tragedies, diaries, daydreams, larks or fancies in which this procedure plays a vital part? In my forthcoming manuscript, I demonstrate gross ignorance of basic medical fact and speculate that Victorians could have performed this procedure, so any mention of it will confirm to my satisfaction the validity of my speculation. (Or, if not confirm, it will prove the procedure haunted the Victorian imagination by means of its terrifying potential, which for scholars of my caliber amounts to the same thing.) I would be particularly interested in accounts demonstrating the procedure not only done to beast and man, but from beast to man. Warmest Regards, Dr. Elderly Jew Deserving of Scorn</span></a></div>
