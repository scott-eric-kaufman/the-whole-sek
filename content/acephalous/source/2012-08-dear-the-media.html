Consider the photograph of Page you're currently using: There are some subtle clues as to Page's ideology hidden in this image. First: That is a Nazi flag. You can tell because it contains a Swastika in a white circle surrounded by a red hem. It is highly unlikely that someone hung it because it means &quot;good luck&quot; in Sanskrit. Also: The repeating patten on that guitar strap is the Confederate Battle Flag. It reminds white people of those glorious antebellum days when blacks were in their place and no real American had even heard of Muslims. Also: That is a Celtic cross.

			<p>I understand why <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/07/glenn-reynolds-demonstrates-how-to-avoid-politicizing-a-tragedy">you&#39;re reluctant</a> to identify Wade Michael Page as a white supremacist, but I&#39;m an expert  in visual rhetoric and I&#39;m here to help you out. Consider the  photograph of Page you&#39;re currently using:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wade.jpg"><img alt="" height="300" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wade-199x300.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="wade" width="199" /></a></p>
<p>There are some subtle clues as to Page&#39;s ideology hidden in this image. First:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wade-01.jpg"><img alt="" height="300" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wade-01-199x300.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="wade 01" width="199" /></a></p>
<p>That is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika_flag">a Nazi flag</a>.  You can tell because it contains a Swastika in a white circle surrounded by a  red hem. It is highly unlikely that someone hung it because it means  &quot;good luck&quot; in Sanskrit. Also:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wade-02.jpg"><img alt="" height="300" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wade-02-199x300.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="wade 02" width="199" /></a></p>
<p>The repeating patten on that guitar strap is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America#Battle_flag">the Confederate Battle Flag</a>.  It reminds white people of those glorious antebellum days when blacks  were in their place and no real American had even heard of Muslims. Also:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wade-04.jpg"><img alt="" height="300" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wade-04-199x300.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="wade 04" width="199" /></a></p>
<p>That is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_cross#Modern_times">a Celtic cross</a>. It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stormfrontlogo.png">the most favorite symbol</a> of the good people at Stormfront.org. Also:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wade-03.jpg"><img alt="" height="300" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wade-03-199x300.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="wade 03" width="199" /></a></p>
<p>That is the number fourteen. It stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Words">the Fourteen Words</a> most dear to oppressed white men in America today. Those words are &quot;We  must secure the existence of our people and a future for White  Children.&quot;</p>
<p>So let me assure you: if you have correctly identified the man in the  photograph above, you don&#39;t need to &quot;speculate&quot; as to whether he was a  white supremacist. Because there&#39;s no room for speculation. That man in  that picture is a white supremacist. Whether his white supremacist  beliefs influenced his decision to murder peaceful Sikhs, that may well  be a matter for debate. But that man? The one in the picture? He&#39;s a  white supremacist.</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01676920b715970b-content"><p>Bang-on about the Gaels not being white to his ancestors, Mickmack. The Irish themselves are a mongrel mix of invasions, and up until the mid-19th century, many Irish along with Africans were taken and enslaved in Barbados (and for a while in Virginia). It was called being Bardados&#39;d, and Swift even mentions it in the beginning of A Modest Proposal. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s neither here nor there. One of the issues in this case is the misappropriation of external symbols when a group has no symbols of its own to convey their beliefs or positions. That in itself is telling, and in part betrays a lack of imagination and lazy thinking -- which may help explain why they&#39;re racist in the first place. </p>

<p>The swastika is the most famous of the misappropriated symbols, and that&#39;s from India. The Celtic cross is another misappropriated symbol (presumably because so many of us Micks are nearly transparent). It predates Christianity: There are standing stone Celtic cross arrangements in Scotland that were there eons before Christianity, and it was most likely was a sun symbol. Thor&#39;s hammer is yet another misappropriated symbol to represent whiteness; Snorri Sturlson, the chronicler of Scandinavian myth and history, even suggests in one of the Eddas (or maybe a Saga) that their people originally arrived from an area around Turkey -- the Lake Van region (hence your Vanir, AQ). How many white supremacists would accept an Anatolian origin? </p>

<p>FWIW: TG4 (Ireland) and BBC Scotland did a joint documentary on the Celtic descendants of Barbados slaves, called Redlegs (the Scottish one is called Barbadoe&#39;d). It&#39;s difficult to find, and much of the TG4 version is in Gaelic, but it&#39;s an excellent glimpse into the legacy of slavery (or continuous indentured servitude, which amounted to the same thing). When the British freed the Barbados slaves, they didn&#39;t give the Irish slaves the same rights as the African slaves, which resulted in a segregated culture much like the one that existed in the U.S. South for African descendants. Today, a lot of Barbados locals just see the descendants as &quot;poor whites&quot; with a strange accent and spooky folk traditions (imagine the X-Files episode &quot;Theef&quot; in an Irish-Caribbean accent).</p>

<p>The problem here is that this legacy has been misappropriated by many white supremacists in the U.S. as their own equal-but-opposite black experience, which they believe gives them the right to challenge African-Americans on civil rights (i.e. &#39;Where are my reparations?&#39;). Of course the scale and scope of African slavery eclipses the Celtic example, and nobody of Scots-Irish descent is being racially profiled today simply because they&#39;re of Scots-Irish descent. </p>

<p>The other thing such white supremacists wouldn&#39;t cotton to is the history of integration that African and Irish slave descendants shared. Jazz musician Willy Ruff found a great example of this when he was trying to rescue an old hymn form that was sung in southern black churches going back to the slave days. The hymn form was called &quot;lining out,&quot; and had almost disappeared. He scoured southern churches for pieces of sheet music, and found a lot of it was in Gaelic. Turned out it was an old form still used in the Gaeltacht regions of Ireland and Scotland, and was adopted into black churches way-back-when because Gaelic-speaking people were living among and worshiping with African slaves. </p></span>

It's a serialized novel that I'll be writing over the next few months.] He remembers the first time it happened. It is his earliest memory. A. had awoken eager to walk along the banks of one of the city's three rivers—he cannot remember which one—on that morning. He cherished these rare moments to himself, far from the wailing of E., his new brother. His mother insisted he not stray too far from home, but A. knew the area well and that E. would prevent her from following him, so he ranged rather further than he led her to believe. But on this particular morning, A. felt differently adventurous, so he followed his father to the small walled garden occupied by his family's honey bees. The bees frightened him, but he thought if he harvested a comb of honey he could prove to his father he was more worthy of attention than E. He hid behind the bushes lining the front wall and waited for his father to leave. It felt like hours before his father tired of his toil, but eventually he exited the small garden through the side gate and made for his favored tavern. A. allowed a few minutes to pass in case his father—who was always forgetting something—had forgotten something. He emerged from the bushes and approached the clay pots that housed the hives. When the first bee crawled from the nearest pot and took flight, A. felt a strong urge to follow suit. He closed his eyes. He heard the bee circle his head twice, then once more, before he felt it settle on his shoulder. He wondered whether the bee recognized that he was his father's son and pride shuddered through his young body. The bee had tested him and not found him wanting. His mettle steeled, he opened his eyes and glanced at his shoulder. The tiny bee made no effort to sting him, nor did it seem in any hurry to leave. A. took this as a good omen and stepped closer to the hive from which his new friend had departed. He reached the hive and peered down into it. His new friend had many old ones. They danced up and down the walls of the honey combs in what A. could discern to be a pattern. He admired the orderliness of their movement, though he could not discover its purpose. Suddenly, he heard a footfall from beyond the wall. It had the character of a sound made by someone trying not to make sound. A. knew it could not be his father, because when his father returned from the tavern his feet made no effort to hide their tread. He waited, as still and silent in the garden as his new friend was upon his shoulder. One minute passed. Two minutes. Three. He decided that he had imagined the sound and returned his...</span></a></div>
