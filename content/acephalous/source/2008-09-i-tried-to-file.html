He says he can't sign it until he arrives home at 4:00 p.m. Says I should drive up to his place and he'll sign it. I say I'll see him then. Third Reader's signatures are in the mail but didn't arrive with it. The department secretary immediately phones Third Reader. He assures her he'd sent it UPS. Not campus mail. Not FedEx.

The boxes say &quot;Copy Paper&quot; on them. The woman behind the counter rings me up. My total comes to $41.00.

<p>The department secretary immediately phones Third Reader.&#0160; He assures her he&#39;d sent it UPS.&#0160; Not campus mail.&#0160; Not FedEx.</p>
<p>The library archives—<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/cashier.html">housed in <em>that </em>library</a>—close at 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>It is now 12:00 p.m.</p>
<p>I walk back across the bridge to the printer.&#0160; They handed me two copies of my dissertation in boxes.&#0160; The boxes say &quot;Copy Paper&quot; on them.&#0160; The woman behind the counter rings me up.&#0160; My total comes to $41.00.</p>
<p>Or approximately nine fewer dollars than the cost of a box of the specified 20-lb 100 percent cotton bond.</p>

<p>It is now 1:00 p.m.</p>
<p>I return to the department and check the mail.&#0160; Nothing from Third Reader.&#0160; Department secretary says not to worry.&#0160; The UPS guy arrives late.&#0160; I don&#39;t worry much.&#0160; I still have four hours.&#0160; I double-check my paper-work.</p>
<p>I FORGOT TO PRINT OUT MY EXIT QUESTIONNAIRE!&#0160; IT IS ALL OVER!</p>
<p>Department secretary says not to worry.&#0160; Says I can walk to Graduate Studies and print it out.&#0160; I do.&#0160; I can.&#0160; I return to the department.&#0160; Still no mail.</p>
<p>Wait a minute—<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTWjPHfXnUE">we still may have mail</a>.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>It is now 2:00 p.m.&#0160; I return to the printer.&#0160; I am handed two boxes.&#0160; They say 20-lb 100 percent cotton bond on them.&#0160; I open one up.&#0160; It is my dissertation.&#0160; Yay!&#0160; Printed on the proper paper.&#0160; Yay!&#0160; With new margins.&#0160; Boo!&#0160; I mention the error.&#0160; The woman denies it.</p>
<p>I show her my table of contents.&#0160; Show her where it says CHAPTER TWO begins on page 81.&#0160; Pull out the first page of CHAPTER TWO.&#0160; Point to the page number at the bottom.&#0160; Ask her whether 76 and 81 are the same number.&#0160; She needs to talk to her manager.&#0160; He is exasperated.&#0160; She is exasperated.&#0160; She is told to be exasperated at home.&#0160; The manager apologizes.&#0160; Explains he charged her for the mistake.&#0160; That she must have widened the margins to keep down her costs.&#0160; Says I still need to pay for the paper.</p>
<p>I laugh at his hilarious joke.&#0160; He is exasperated.&#0160; Says I still need to pay for the paper.&#0160; I laugh again at his hilarious joke.&#0160; He is exasperated.&#0160; Says I must pay for the paper.&#0160; Says he would rather not call security.&#0160; Reminds me he has my home address.</p>
<p>I make eye contact with the other man behind the counter.&#0160; He looks at the manager then back at me.&#0160; His eyes say the manager is a prick who will do this.&#0160; His eyes express sympathy.&#0160; I look at the clock.</p>
<p>It is now 2:45 p.m.</p>
<p>I politely inform him where to insert his precious boxes of 20-lb 100 percent cotton bond with my dissertation in them.&#0160; He says he would rather not call security.&#0160; His eyes say he rather would.&#0160; I pay him $140.&#0160; I tell him I know lawyers.&#0160; He laughs.</p>
<p>It is now 2:50 p.m.</p>
<p>I walk back across the bridge to the department.&#0160; Still no mail.&#0160; Tell the department secretary what happened.&#0160; She offers to let me use her printer if I can find the appropriate paper.&#0160; I bolt across a different bridge to the campus bookstore.&#0160; I bolt back to the department.&#0160; I print my dissertation on the proper paper with the correct margins.&#0160; I look at the clock.</p>
<p>It is now 3:35 p.m.</p>
<p>I run back across the bridge.&#0160; I pass the printer and scowl at its tinted windows.&#0160; I jump in my car and head up to the house of my chair.&#0160; I am about to turn when I hear a sharp whoop.&#0160; I check my mirror and see that the whooper is a motorcycle police.&#0160; He asks me if I know why he pulled me over.&#0160; I say I do.&#0160; I show him the paperwork from the DMV indicating that I have paid my registration.&#0160; He walks back to his motorcycle and shoots shit with dispatch.</p>
<p>It is now 3:55 p.m.</p>
<p>He writes me a ticket to appear in court before December.&#0160; I say that is nice of him.&#0160; It is.&#0160; He says he hates the DMV.&#0160; Hates the lines.&#0160; Hates how they make his life hard for him.&#0160; How people like me who pay their registration spend weeks waiting to receive their stickers.&#0160; I agree.&#0160; He tells me to have a nice day.&#0160; I slam on the gas and arrive at the house of my chair.</p>
<p>It is now 4:05 p.m.</p>
<p>I hand him my Ph.D. II form.&#0160; He signs it.&#0160; I hand him one signature page.&#0160; He signs it.&#0160; I hand him my ticket.&#0160; He says there is nothing he can do about that.&#0160; I say <a href="http://www.moviesoundclips.net/movies1/batmanbegins/hard.wav">I wanted him to know how hard this was</a>.&#0160; No I don&#39;t.&#0160; I say my mistake and hand him my other signature page.&#0160; He says congratulations I think.</p>
<p>I was already sprinting back to my car.&#0160; I park near the library.&#0160; I run to the department.&#0160; There may be mail.</p>
<p>THERE IS MAIL!&#0160; Papers are signed.&#0160; I return to my Second Reader.&#0160; He is reluctant to sign it.&#0160; He says he never saw the final versions of my chapters.&#0160; I am confused.&#0160; I had been led to believe that Second and Third Readers read drafts and make suggestions.&#0160; Revisions are made and submitted to the chair.&#0160; He either approves or disapproves of them.&#0160; I say as much.</p>
<p>He says how does he know what he is signing off on.&#0160; Says I am very unprofessional.&#0160; I stare a stare of exhaustion and confusion.&#0160; I have run across bridges for hours.&#0160; I say I had revised my chapters in accordance with his criticisms and that my chair had read and approved the revisions.&#0160; I said I was revising until yesterday.&#0160; He says a professional would have submitted those revisions to his Second and Third Readers.&#0160; That a professional would have submitted the revisions I made yesterday to his entire committee.</p>
<p>I try to say but even if I had I would still have been revising until the last minute but he cuts me off and says I should stop digging.</p>
<p>He signs the paper.&#0160; He says good luck but his tone tells me not to submit any future revisions to him.&#0160; I try to explain but he turns back to his computer.</p>
<p>It is now 4:30 p.m.</p>
<p>I am escorted downstairs by the department secretary.&#0160; The Dean signs his name and congratulates me.&#0160; I say thank you.&#0160; He says something about the license plate of the truck that hit me and the department secretary visibly winces.&#0160; She tells me to run upstairs and I hear her <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/why_i_didnt_pos.html">explain her wincing</a>.</p>
<p>As I climb the stairs my right shoe almost slips off.&#0160; I look down.&#0160; I am <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/08/because-ive-bec.html">no longer Oedipus</a>.&#0160; I am dehydrated.&#0160; Dehydration does wonders for swelling.&#0160; I have no time to appreciate those wonders.&#0160; I flop flop flop up the stairs and grab my dissertation.&#0160; I flop flop flop across campus to the library.</p>
<p>It is now 4:45 p.m.</p>
<p>I see a <a href="http://www.mindonfire.com/">friend of mine</a> reading new fiction in front of the elevators.&#0160; I consider stopping to chat but dart into the elevator instead.&#0160; I enter a purgatory of sluggish ascension.&#0160; I am between the first and second floor.&#0160; Hours pass.&#0160; I am between the first and second floor.&#0160; I slump against the wall and pass out.&#0160; I wake to find <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jpd/misc/apecity.html">apes in charge</a>.&#0160; They throw me into an office in which <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my_morning.html">undergraduates once copulated</a>.&#0160; I begin to weep when I hear a shrill ding.&#0160; I am on the roof of the library.</p>
<p>It is now 4:50 p.m.</p>
<p>I sprint across the roof and into the archives.&#0160; I am met by a smiling man.&#0160; He says I just made it.&#0160; Tells me to sit down and take deep breaths.&#0160; Assures me we can finish this.&#0160; I hand him cash money for my fees.&#0160; He says the library likes cash money.&#0160; I say <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/unbelievable-up.html">I know</a>.&#0160; He looks at me and smiles.&#0160; Says it looks like you had a hard day doctor and offers me his hand.</p>
<p>This time the tears come.</p>

		<span id="comment-130096524-content"><p>No, you will never look back on the horrors of this day and laugh.  Not once.  But now you&#39;re in the club.  Congratulations!  </p>

<p>Just so you&#39;ll know you are not alone, let me tell you my dissertation printing horror story.  After I had hand delivered copies of my my diss to my committee, I walked across campus, climbed atop a bar stool at the local dive, and ordered a double Jack Daniels on the rocks.  I felt the need  to celebrate my awesomeness, I guess.  As I began to sip the cool brown liquid, I pulled out of the printer&#39;s box the copy I had made for myself -- you know, just to glance one more time at the manuscript that I had spent all those years writing.  I was feeling pretty damned good about getting it done and congratulating myself for having spent the extra bucks to have it printed out at Kinko&#39;s on a quality machine, using good paper.</p>

<p>That&#39;s when I saw it.  Every superscript of every endnote in the entire 350 page manuscript had been changed from the 1,2,3 sequence I had typed into Roman numerals.  I&#39;ll never forget the feeling of both horror and emptiness I felt at that moment.</p>

<p>The next day was a blur as I scrambled to get the whole thing redone.  But at least I ended that horrible day without getting a ticket and without having my foot swell up to twice its size.</p>

<p>I hope you still have the strength to celebrate.  You&#39;ve earned it.</p></span>

Me, I accidentally sent the wrong file to the printer - the pre-proofread one. So my thesis is just full of these lousy, nagging little mistakes, and at least one paragraph which just trails off into nothing mid-sentence. </p></span>

Irony is delicious. WLS is upset because one manufactured scandal drowned out the The New York Times’s coverage of the most important unreported story ever. If you’re of the opinion that the McCain campaign is overstuffed with tactical geniuses dedicated to sitting on the sordid tale of the Annenberg Challenge until closer to the election, listen up, because I’m about to tell a story. It begins, as Tom Maguire writes, “[a]t a White House event with Bill Clinton [where] philanthropist Walter Annenberg announced that he was making a $500 million grant to cities across the nation to put towards public school reform.” The intrigue and perfidy originate, as does everything currently wrong with the country, with Bill Clinton and a leftist billionaire cast in the Soros mold. Bill Ayers, former WU terrorist and Annenberg’s brother-in-ideology, requested and received $50 million for urban enrichment programs which would, in accordance with the core beliefs of all involved, function as leftist indoctrination camps. While much is known and reviled about Ayers and his personal choice to chair the Chicago Annenberg Challenge’s board, Barack Obama, relatively little attention has been paid to their benefactor—the man who personally approved Ayers’s $150 million plan to put the Che back in Chicago—Walter Annenberg. Annenberg arrived on the national scene when he and his father, Philadelphia publisher Moses “Moe” Annenberg, were charged with evading $3,258,809 in income taxes. Although based in Philadelphia, the Annenberg clan’s ties with the Chicago political machine were already well-established: his co-defendants included “James M. Ragen Sr., Chicago, former general manager of Nation-wide News Service, Inc.; James M. Ragen Jr., Chicago, son of the Nation-wide general manager; Charles W. Bidwill, Chicago, head of a printing company and owner of the Chicago Cardinals, professional football club; [and] Herbert S. Kamin, Chicago.”[1] His father was successfully prosecuted, but Walter avoided jail-time. He spent the better part of the next decade in a manner befitting a billionaire wastrel: rubbing shoulders with the Hollywood elite.[2] When he assumed control of his father’s publishing empire after Moses’s death in 1952, Annenberg used those Hollywood connections to start a little magazine called TV Guide. Under his stewardship, Triangle Publications waged war against conservative American values from the pages of Seventeen to the stages of American Bandstand. As the 1952 election neared, he hosted countless fundraisers for the first “eggheaded” political neophyte from Illinois whose Presidential aspirations were dashed by a humble war hero: Adlai Stevenson. At an exclusive Malibu Beach estate, the Los Angeles Times reported, Annenberg convened “[m]ore than 40 State and national Republican Party leaders [for] dinner with Sen. Nixon, who flew [there] from Denver to meet with them.”[3]. That doesn’t sound—never mind. Even hard-core communist sympathizers can have a day of clarity. Annenberg’s solstice of sanity ended with a winter chill. As the end of Eisenhower’s second term neared, the Kennedy clan courted the powerful publisher’s for support in the 1960 elections: “Vice-President and Mrs. Nixon were hosts at a small dinner party in their Forest...</span></a></div>
