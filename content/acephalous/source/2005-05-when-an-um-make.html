		<span id="comment-5566538-content"><p>Stephen,</p>

<p>Apparently he&#39;s not blind to irony and sarcasm, he sees it, recognizes it, but because it&#39;s inconvenient to his argument, he chooses to ignore it.  Today&#39;s example: &quot;There always seems to be an alternate reading, an escape clause. I have no idea if Jonathan had such a grant and actually lost it, or if he&#39;s making some kind of ironic comment here that he finds satisfying, but nevertheless doesn&#39;t mean what it appears to mean.&quot;  That&#39;s some mean strain of the stupids he&#39;s contracted.  I&#39;m also now a &quot;useful idiot,&quot; which is odd given how tiny and insignificant my contributions to society&#39;ll be <i>even if</i> I become the most important writer on turn-of-the-century American literature and culture the world has ever known.  </p>

<p>Adam,</p>

<p>The Bruce has spoken.  All you can do now, as the kids say, is &quot;deal.&quot;  </p></span>

Let there be commerce between us.&quot; But as soon as CO takes this as some kind of a conciliatory gesture, Holbo makes sure you can&#39;t assume that; &quot;By &#39;let there be commerce between us&#39; I just meant a caravan from one of my posts has reached your blog. Each post can have three. I want the gold and science bonus. I&#39;m trying to discover writing. Admittedly your blog is rather small, but commerce with blogs from different civilizations is worth more.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way he can be <i>that</i> stupid, what with the conversation having turned to Civilization III and all.  I&#39;d comment more about his stupendous stupidity, but I&#39;ve no more stupid-word with which to smart-, clever- or witty-comment about his stupid-post, stupid-comment, stupid-self.  </p></span>

<p>Call for articles about The Michael Jackson Trial<br />
For special issue of the international journal &#39;Social Semiotics&#39;</p>

<p>*    How does Michael Jackson&#39;s trial, and the associated media spectacle,<br />
mobilises ideas about gender, race, class, the body, queer, sexuality,<br />
power, childhood/adulthood, fandom and celebrity?<br />
*    What does the reporting tell us about phenomena such as the U.S.<br />
televised trial, the media event, the use of chat shows and the role of<br />
personal testimony?<br />
*    What are the socio-political contexts and implications of this major<br />
media spectacle?</p>

<p>The Michael Jackson ³pedophilia² trial has become a staple of global media.<br />
This new phase of the pop superstar/icon&#39;s biography draws attention to the<br />
volatile mix of race, sexuality, gender and celebrity status that has marked<br />
media coverage of a range of late-twentieth century &quot;scandals&quot;, such as the<br />
OJ Simpson Trial, Princess Diana, Monica Lewinsky, Mike Tyson, etc.  We are<br />
interested in using the Michael Jackson trial to investigate the particular<br />
ways in which his star persona has become the site where a number of<br />
cultural anxieties about power, childhood, racialized sexuality, and<br />
masculinity. We are also interested in drawing parallels between this trial<br />
and other media spectacles, as Marjorie Garber and other scholars have<br />
termed these phenomena.  We are interested in exploring the reasons the<br />
Michael Jackson media spectacle has resonated across cultural and national<br />
borders, the forms of media practices it has enabled and also the particular<br />
ways in which coverage of this celebrity scandal provides insight to<br />
contemporary cultural formations.</p>

<p>Jenny Kitzinger is editing a special issue of the journal &#39;Social Semiotics&#39;<br />
and is inviting contributions around these and other questions. (Further<br />
details about the journal are below)</p>

<p>If you are interested please send us a brief outline (no more than one page<br />
by 20th May. We will then select from these abstracts to invite submission<br />
of full articles. Articles should be between 4,000 and 8,000 words.</p>

<p>All articles will be subject to peer review. </p></span>

I spent several uncoordinated minutes staring at X after X after X after X only to learn that my incompetence suggested a slight automatic preference for White relative to Black. The next test I took suggested a strong automatic preference for African American relative to White American. The only conclusion I can draw is that I have a slight disinclination to converse with a Black person until I'm 100% certain he or she is an American, at which point the bonds of national identity shove aside whatever minute, unconscious reservations I had had. Which means I'm not a racist... ...I'm a xenophobe. All things considered, is there a better -ist to be in Southern California?</span></a></div>

(So the metaphor breaks down. They all do.) However confused Seltzer is, Mr. Pease pays him one form of respect: the always popular intricate rebuttal of metatheoretical minutiae. Seltzer's thesis--also interesting, also too-clever-by-half-to-be-entirely-believable--argues that London's writing was governed by the logic of a &quot;body-machine complex&quot; in which bodies regulated by a Foucauldian disciplinary apparatus became awful machine-like. That makes people (and dogs) unhappy. Or, technically speaking, &quot;anxious,&quot; as in The anxiety which emanated from this scenario resides in the fear that individuals might lose the ability to distinguish between &quot;natural&quot; (sexual reproduction) and &quot;unnatural&quot; (machine reproduction). But since in Seltzer's account, the &quot;natural&quot; refers to the strategies whereby social norms are psychologically legitimized and delegitimated, the &quot;natural&quot; cannot be understood except as an effect of these processes of naturalization. The imagined threat through which the anxiety is communicated has deployed pre-existing psychic norms to police the boundary between bodies and machines. While this fantasy may have produced the competition between the &quot;natural&quot; body and the &quot;unnatural&quot; machine, it was the discourse of psychoanalysis that supplied the normative categories of the &quot;natural&quot; and the &quot;unnatural&quot; through which the body machine complex regulated Seltzer's disciplinary society. In the discourse of psychoanalysis, Seltzer finds the pre-existing meta-conceptual criteria enabling the distinction between the natural and the unnatural. All clear? No? The discourse of psychoanalysis instituted and thereafter enforced the normative distinctions--between &quot;natural&quot; and deviant disciplinary practices, between &quot;natural&quot; and pathological modes of reproduction--which at once precipitated and managed the anxieties through which the body-machine...</span></a></div>
