In the final scene of &quot;The Rejected,&quot; John Slattery provides a clue as to why when he transports the viewer into the hallway outside Draper&#39;s apartment.&#0160; He begins behind the head of an old woman whose husband has stepped in the hall and asks &quot;Did you get pears?&quot;
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0134865030fb970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-avatar00016" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0134865030fb970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0134865030fb970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Vlcsnap-avatar00016" /></a> <br />Whether or not she bought pears is a private matter.&#0160; The whole hall neither cares nor needs to know the answer to that question and so she refuses to answer it.&#0160; His wife seems more concerned with what her husband is unwittingly communicating: not that he needs to know whether she purchased pears, but 1) that he is so obsessed with trivial matters that he will wait by the door until he hears footsteps and accost his wife about pears, or 2) that he doesn&#39;t trust his wife to remember to purchase the object of his obsession because she cares neither about it nor him, or 3) that he believes she will remember, but deliberately refuse, his beloved pears out of spite, or 4) all of the above (or something equally private).&#0160; In short, his wife wants their private life to be transacted in the privacy of their own apartment, as is evident when Slattery <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#51531" target="_self">reverses</a> to guage her reaction:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef013486503ded970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-avatar00017" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef013486503ded970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef013486503ded970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Vlcsnap-avatar00017" /></a> <br />In addition to her stoic expression — eruptions of the private in public seem to have long been a feature of her marriage — Slattery allows the viewer to see Draper&#39;s reaction to this particular display.&#0160; The man whose public has become his only self is forced to witness an old woman enforce the distinction between private and public better than he had.&#0160; He would not be in that hallway had he only had her ability to manage his public and private selves.&#0160; As she walks toward her apartment her husband continues to hector her, but she betrays no emotion until she is entering her apartment, at which point she informs him that &quot;We&#39;ll discuss it inside.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f32cd178970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-avatar00035" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f32cd178970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f32cd178970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Vlcsnap-avatar00035" /></a> <br />That she tells him this<em> when she is already inside </em>indicates who won this particular power struggle.&#0160; No doubt she will answer his question once in the apartment, but the significance of her maintaining her public face in public is not lost on the man across the hall:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f32cd6d2970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-avatar00036" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f32cd6d2970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f32cd6d2970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Vlcsnap-avatar00036" /></a></p>
<p>Whereas she has a private face to complement her public one, Draper is about to enter his apartment wearing his public face because now he has no other.&#0160; There is no &quot;private&quot; behind his &quot;public&quot; face.&#0160; &quot;Don Draper&quot; has finally fulfilled his destiny: he is an ad for a product that no longer exists.&#0160; (I wonder what <a href="http://adswithoutproducts.com/" target="_self">someone</a> might think of this.)</p>

<p>Not quite--Pete Campbell and Bert Cooper also know.  But this doesn&#39;t work out much better for Don, since their knowledge of his past just becomes blackmail material to tie him more closely to the firm.  Instead of an escape valve for him, its just another reminder for him of how vulnerable the life he&#39;s built still is.  It&#39;s significant that neither of them is really friendly with Don, in the way that Roger Sterling or Lane Pryce are--and that the latter two have also gone through divorce.  </p></span>

Books should be rereadable, but Fantagraphics' editions of Jason's work explode upon reading. If you pick one up after having read it, the binding will release the pages from their commitment to the book and allow them to form a new one with a pile on the floor. Scattered thus, they make for a far less compelling narrative ... but they are much easier to scan. Might this analog bug be a digital feature? (Most likely not.) UPDATE: Talk about service. There's a reason I love this press.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/08/this-is-nothing-like-it-was-in-my-room.html"><span><strong>&quot;This is nothing like it was in my room.&quot;</strong> That I love The National should surprise no one, but that's not why I'm being frivolous on a Friday night and linking to their recent performance of &quot;Mr. November&quot; at Lollapalooza. I link because of the incidental jollity contained within and created by this unspectacular performance of a weaker track off their last album. The performance is captured from the crowd by R. Todd Morason: The first memorable moment occurs at the 1:29 mark, when lead singer Matt Berninger drunkenly staggers over and begins to serenade a young girl seated on the left stage terrace. As soon as he notices her, he cleans up the lyric &quot;I won't fuck you over, I'm Mr. November&quot; for her delicate ears. Her mother snaps a picture and writes up the experience. Having two bits of demonstrable proof of so unlikely event means we are living in the future. Berninger then ambles off the stage entirely and into the crowd (2:10), at which point Morason loses him. He turns his phone to the large screens flanking the stage in an attempt to find him but fails (2:25), then pans right to survey the crowd again only to discover Berninger's about to run into him (2:33). The whole scene seems choreographed, right down to the crowd becoming a communal road crew and passing Berninger's wire above their heads.* What began as a slightly off-key performance of a mediocre song becomes the sort of spectacle we all wish every concert will be as the lights dim and the first note sounds. *Videos like this make me think the shaky cam's days as a hallmark of televisual realism are numbered. The autocorrection function in cheap new cameras steadies all hands to the point where, in ten years, people will wonder why they let cinematographers continue rolling while in the midst of epileptic fits.</span></a></div>
