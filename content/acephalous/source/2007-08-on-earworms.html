<p>And when I said &quot;shooting lasers from his eyes&quot; I meant something like <a href="http://academiccog.blogspot.com/2007/08/deconstructionist-superheroes.html" rel="nofollow">this,</a> but couldn&#39;t find my copy the other night. </p>

<p>Incidentally, the sports-related earworm I always get is the chant of &quot;AIR-ball! AIR-ball!&quot; which Dave Barry, in one of his columns, proved is always sung on the notes of A and F. </p>

<p>You know, you could probably make a two-part harmony of that and the &quot;hole/ in the sky&quot; chant and create the Ultimate Earworm.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-78316382-content"><p>The there-is-a-hole-in-the-sky fan at Miller Park sounds a lot like Wrigley Field&#39;s infamous Ronnie &quot;Woo Woo&quot; Wickers.  When listening to a Cubs game, one used to be able to hear Wickers in the background chanting his melodic-but-mind-numbing &quot;Woo Woo&quot; all throughout.  His chant transformed the &quot;earworm&quot; phenomena into an ear-tapeworm one. I think Ronnie&#39;s been banned from the park this year.  Hopefully that won&#39;t result in another silly curse. - TL</p></span>

Then Adam came around, and started writing for The Valve, but what most people don't realize is that I'm the most important person in this story ... at least so long as I'm the one who tells it. The way I tell it, Adam was scouring the internet doing research. One day, long after he had finished thinking through the premise of his novel, he came across Acephalous. After observing my radiant resplendence waxing effulgent, he contacted me, and so began the chain of events which would lead to him being the much better contributor to The Valve ... by which I mean, only after basking in the intense brilliant glowing of my intensely glowing brilliance did he become the shining star he is. Without me, he'd be nothing more than a tenured professor who writes award-winning science fiction in his spare time. So when I trudged down to campus today, checked my box and found a copy of his new novel, Land of the Headless, I couldn't wait to read it. Sure, the idea was his, as was its successful execution ... but without my keen editorial advice, the acknowledgments page never would've read: Thanks to Rachel, my sisters, my parents, and to Simon, my editor. Scott Eric Kaufman read the whole manuscript and made many helpful suggestions. His headless realm is at http://acephalous.typepad.com. You see? Without my input, the most important part of that acknowledgment would've been lost to history. To history! Mark my words: one day when I'm less than half as successful as him, Adam will thank me for deigning to appear in his acknowledgments.* *All of which is only to say, I feel privileged to have read this fine work of speculative fiction prepublication, and can't wait to reread it, so that I might annoy my wife with every minuscule trace of my possible influence on the finished product. (I could go all languagehat on her and read a chapter aloud every night before I tuck us in ... but that'd be creepy. Why isn't it creepy when he does it?)</span></a></div>

Autistic-like responses will show poor social skill, attention switching, communication and imagination, and an exaggerated attention to detail. In other words, geekiness. You scored 35. Scores over 32 are generally taken to indicate Asperger's Syndrome or high-functioning autism, with more than 34 an &quot;extreme&quot; score. I don't have poor social skills—I'm a charmer! I'm exquisitely communicative and quite imaginative—look at all the great stories I invented whole-cloth for your amusement! But I'll cop to an exaggerated attention to detail. I do pay too much attention to things that don't matter. But this talent allows me to discover tiny things liable to escape the notice of people with perspective. Were I less detail-oriented, I may have finished the dissertation already ... but it wouldn't have nearly as many footnotes. And footnotes—especially when of dubious relevance—are what really makes a monograph look scholarly. On an unrelated note, I found this post and the comments it generated so interesting I kept the tab open for three or four days.</span></a></div>
