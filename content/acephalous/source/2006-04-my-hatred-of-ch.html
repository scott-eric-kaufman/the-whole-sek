</p>

<p>That's a classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiasmus">chiasmus</a> . . . even if it lacks the poetry of Yeats' &quot;<a href="http://www.poemtree.com/poems/IrishAirmanForsees.htm">An Irish Airman Foresees His Death</a>.&quot;&nbsp; Yeats plays with the tension produced by chiasmus in &quot;An Irish Airman.&quot;&nbsp; Observe the final four lines:</p>

<p>A certain breed of literary scholars failed to learn from this.&nbsp; I admit that my initial infatuation with Deleuzian philosophy stemmed from its opposition to all things hierarchical.&nbsp; Its rhizomes embraced the messiness of the world and I liked that.&nbsp; You know: &quot;To every chiasmus inheres a line-of-flight.&quot;&nbsp; But then there's the other trend in literary scholarship: that of the unacknowledged or crypto-hierarchy which often sails under the flag of Theory.&nbsp; Certainly the perfectly chiasmatic and orderly theoretical works of literature should not condemn the entire enterprise . . . but in panel and session titles like the ones above I see the creep of the worst infecting the best.&nbsp; Fraser's chiasmus is a clever implement designed to channel the conversation in a sorely limited direction.&nbsp; As <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0691015074">Brook Thomas</a> explains of another such chiasmus:</p><blockquote><p>There is a tendency to transform the chiasmatic relationship from one of difference into one of identity.&nbsp; This tendency is neatly illustrated in Warner's transformation of Montrose's formulation, &quot;the historicity of texts and the textuality of history,&quot; into the assertion that &quot;the text is historical; and history is textual.&quot;&nbsp; This replacement of difference by identity leads to another tendency—that of disciplinary imperialism, masquerading as interdisciplinary work.&nbsp; The chiasmatic coupling of two disciplines has the appearance of interdisciplinarity.&nbsp; But, if, as in the case of Warner, the other discipline can be reduced to textuality, the most perceptive cultural critics turn out to be—lo and behold—readers of texts.&nbsp; Since everything is a text and since literary critics are trained to read texts, some feel quite comfortable moving to texts produced in disciplines outside their field and telling the naive (but professionally trained) practioners of those fields how those texts should be read. (10)</p></blockquote><p>Thomas refers to this tendency as &quot;disciplinary arrogance.&quot;&nbsp; I'd stress that it's abetted by the convenience of a philosophical position which reduces everything to &quot;the text&quot; via declarations that <a href="http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2006/02/prof_johnson_on.html"><em>il n'y a pas de hors-text</em></a>.&nbsp; If one assumes Derrida's correct isn't what necessarily follows from it a kind of disciplinary imperialism?&nbsp; (This obviously wouldn't stem from Derrida's work so much as chiasmatic appropriations and elaborations of his thought.)</p>

<p>All of which is only to implore you to distrust unmessy chiasmus.&nbsp; I think.&nbsp; But it's been a &quot;the option&quot; day today . . . which means I may only be cranky.</p>

<p>And Scott, I was simply thrilled to see a post on chiasmus!  I love a fun rhetorical trope on a sunny Saturday morning, even a frequently misused and abused one.  And nice analysis of Yeats&#39; brilliant use of it.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-15973844-content"><p>Jon, that rung a bell, so <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=jameson+chiasmus+marxist" rel="nofollow">I googled it</a>.  My first reaction upon seeing that was horror; my second, curiousity; my third, relief.  Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t find the reference you and I are both thinking of.</p>

<p>Dr. V., she is a political scientist, and that does invalidate my specific point (and substantiate my claims of grumpiness); but I think the general point still holds, no?  (That chiasmus is often deployed in such disciplinarily imperialistic manners.)</p>

<p>Kevin and Jim, I think you&#39;ve nailed one aspect of my complaint: had it been a clever chiasmus instead of one whose cleverness I noted dismissively, I wouldn&#39;t have minded (hence the comparison to Yeats). </p>

<p>Chance, damn fine point, that is.  Connects with something Amardeep <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/sat_analogy_.html#comment-15756338" rel="nofollow">mentioned</a> the other day.  It <i>invites</i> violation of logic, and thus if it ain&#39;t used perfectly or willfully imperfectly, it fails.</p>

<p>Jonathan, it was.  Now it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Tim, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s surprising that people with a penchant for systemization love overly structured literary tropes.  As a friend of mine once said, &quot;weak minds love systems,&quot; to which I&#39;ll add, &quot;as do strong ones when tired or annoyed.&quot;  (And I&#39;m still working on getting John to cough up that analytic list.  So far the best I&#39;ve gotten from him is the new two volume Soames tome.)</p></span>

<p>Adam, I think I&#39;ll leave that one to you.  I&#39;ve never been quite able to understand what it&#39;s supposed to mean.

<p>Oh, totally.  But my love and affection for a particular political theorist (who wouldn&#39;t, btw, write such a terribly banal chiasmus!) made me want to defend political theorists in general.  They&#39;re very put upon in their own fields -- no wonder they (or at least my boyfriend) hang out with us lit. folks.</p>

<p>And I totally think you should do a post on &quot;of.&quot;  I love of.  To wit, The Book of Margery Kempe is: about Kempe, belonging to Kempe, by Kempe, constituting Kempe, divisible into the many parts of Kempe, and so on and so on.  I actually like teaching the partitive genitive in Old English.  And when I wrote my diss and it had an &quot;of&quot; in its title that signified twenty ways &#39;til sundown I couldn&#39;t be more pleased with myself.  Now that&#39;s it&#39;s a book it still has an &quot;of&quot; in it, but it&#39;s not nearly as colorful, alas.  Publishers are starting to crack down on our abuses in titles.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-16001460-content"><p>There are even more senses of the genitive than that, too.  For instance, valuation (as in the infamous &quot;flocci non facio&quot;).  And I think Greek has a genitive absolute that&#39;s analogous to Latin&#39;s ablative absolute?  Fortunately we have a <a href="http://omega.cohums.ohio-state.edu/latin/grammar/genitive_case.htm" rel="nofollow">list</a>!</p>

<p>I just encountered a &quot;both senses of the genitive&quot; use in a class on the first critique, with reference to its title.</p></span>

So does every successful writer. In my class today—the second of the quarter—my students were treated to guest appearances by New York Times best-selling author Joshua Wolf Shenk and Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Barry Siegel. (And damn did they ever handle it with aplomb.) Joshua talked to them about his writing routine—a mandatory three hours slaving and flailing daily—and as he did the contours of my own routine became more apparent. (What can I say? Contrast has a way of creating reliefs.) My routine is more ambitious than his by the very degree to which I'm a lesser writer. I don't tie myself to the chair for three hours daily but six. Had I Shenk's skills I wouldn't need to. (Only I don't. So I do.) Over the course of the conversation I inadvertantly revealed to my students the existence of &quot;'The Option' Days.&quot; What are &quot;'The Option' Days&quot;? Besides an excuse to indulge my love of awkward quotational apparatuses, &quot;'The Option' Days&quot; are those entirely comprised of six or more hours staring at a Word document which contains only the words &quot;the&quot; and &quot;option&quot; (in that order) and being dunderstruck trying to complete the sentence. Do I want a verb? &quot;The option considered by . . .&quot; would make for a fine sentence. As would one in which &quot;the option&quot; introduces a prepositional phrase: &quot;The option before the . . .&quot; That would also work. Whichever one I choose will determine the argument and tone and structure of all that comes after it. So I sit there. Paralyzed by &quot;the option.&quot; Haunted by &quot;the option.&quot; Aware of the irony inherent in feeling paralyzed and haunted by all the options &quot;the option&quot; provides but unable to appreciate its ironical exquisiteness for the foul mood into which I've descended. So I sit. Frustrated. I stare dumbly. And brood. Over the dead end that is &quot;the option.&quot;</span></a></div>

Silent while he drank it. Feebleminded before the caffeine kicked. A dullard once it did. Lethargic as he watered plants. Thick when he watered pots. Thicker when they contained no plants. Thickest when they were empty. Aghast at the mess he'd made. Overwhelmed by the clean-up it entailed. Speechless to explain it. Simple-minded when he started writing. Simpler-minded minutes later. Confounded by the simplest thing. Bewildered by the simpler. So he stood up and paced per doctorate's orders and was: Winded by exertion. Shocked awake by the pain. Almost comatose with effort. Struck by unathleticism. Saddened by his state. Determined to exercise. Drained at the very thought. Resigned to sedentary life. And sedentary thrills. And sedentary ass. He picked himself from the floor and sat at his desk and for the next four hours wrote: Fluff. Howlers. Screamers. Fallacies. Errors. Missteps. Stupidities. Clinkers. Clunkers. Gaffes. Inaccuracies. Idiocies. Blunders. Falsehoods. One blog post.</span></a></div>
