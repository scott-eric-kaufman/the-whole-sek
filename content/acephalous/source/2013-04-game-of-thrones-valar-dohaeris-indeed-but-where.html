The reverse to the long shot—which is even more unbalanced than the one from which it reverses—heightens Sam's humiliation by including the presence of everyone he failed to serve: Point being, the opening sequence strongly suggests that service (and its terms) will be a thematic element of this episode in a way that death (in its finality) was not in &quot;Valar Morghulis.&quot; In truth, saying that..." />

<p>Sam Tarly&#39;s service is twofold here: first, his general service as a man of the Night&#39;s Watch; second, his particular service as a member of a scouting party, which was to tend to and dispatch distress-ravens. That he failed to do so during his epic flight from the White Walker only indicates that he failed to meet the terms of his service, not that he escaped the responsibility of serving altogether. The episode&#39;s director, Daniel Minahan, could have foregrounded the humiliation written on Sam&#39;s face when his Lord Commander upbraids him by using a close-up, which would&#39;ve captured every mortified muscle trying not to twitch with shame; instead, Minahan decided to shoot Sam in a medium close-up <em>with </em>his Lord Commander in an off-center two-shot that suggests both the bonds these two share <em>and</em> the precariousness of their situation:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3844a64f970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Skyfall00228" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3844a64f970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3844a64f970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Skyfall00228" /></a><br />But it is not just these two, bound by service though they may be, who are <a href="http://youtu.be/9Dg6DpEAscU" target="_self">in a tight spot</a>. The reverse to the long shot—which is even more unbalanced than the one from which it reverses—heightens Sam&#39;s humiliation by including the presence of everyone he failed to serve:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d4273e599970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="SAM04" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d4273e599970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d4273e599970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="SAM04" /></a><br />
Point being, the opening sequence strongly suggests that service (and its terms) will be a thematic element of this episode in a way that death (in its finality) was not in &quot;Valar Morghulis.&quot; In truth, saying that service &quot;strongly suggests&quot; itself as a theme is an understatement so grave as to almost be a lie: from Jon Snow and Ser Barristan pledging their respective fealty to Mance Rayder and Daenerys, to Tyrion and Davos bemoaning their father and father-figure&#39;s reluctance to recognize their commitment to the cause, and did I mention the Unsullied? The elite band of warrior-eunuchs who have been on their feet for nearly two days just waiting for someone to slice off their nipples? These are examples of the meaning of &quot;service&quot; to which the phrase &quot;Valar Dohaeris&quot; conventionally applies, so connecting the visual rhetoric to iterations of this theme would be a bore. </p>
<p>More interesting is the visual pun on another meaning of the word &quot;serve&quot; that worms its way into the episode. Consider the scene in which Cersei comes to talk to Tyrion, who is still convalescing in his new quarters. Tyrion hears her knock, pulls a stool to the door and greets his sister <em>through the bars</em>:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3844da92970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Skyfall00089" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3844da92970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3844da92970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Skyfall00089" /></a><br /><em></em>He is not a prisoner in King&#39;s Landing any more than his sister is:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3844dbfe970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Skyfall00088" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3844dbfe970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3844dbfe970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Skyfall00088" /></a><br />And yet Minahan chooses to shot both through the bars. The tightness of the framing on Tyrion makes him seem the more imprisoned one, because this shot is, debatably, from Cersei&#39;s point-of-view. Despite having an entire door to look at, she focuses her attention (via the camera&#39;s close-up) on the one section of the door that emphasizes the bars between her and her brother. (She could just look at the door, after all.) The reverse shot from Cersei, however, isn&#39;t even debatable: it&#39;s clearly a point-of-view shot from Tyrion&#39;s perspective. He&#39;s looking at his sister <em>as if</em> he is serving time, and and for what? For successfully defending King&#39;s Landing at Blackwater? Tywin will answer those questions later, but for the moment I want to focus on Minahan&#39;s decision to imprison, visually at the very least, members of the Lannister family. Because they aren&#39;t serving—<em>they&#39;re serving time</em>. </p>
<p>It&#39;s not just Cersei and Tyrion who find themselves behind or speaking between bars. When Joffrey and his newly betrothed, Margaery Tyrell, venture into the city, here is the perspective the young king has of his subjects:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3844ed20970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Skyfall00193" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3844ed20970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c3844ed20970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Skyfall00193" /></a><br />Those bars framing the shot? They&#39;re bars:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d427418e2970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Skyfall00194" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d427418e2970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d427418e2970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Skyfall00194" /></a><br />This medium shot is almost too precious. Look at little King Joffrey peeping at his bride-to-be through the bars of his processional. He doesn&#39;t occupy the center of the shot, nor does his tiny blue carriage, the size of which suggests that peeking out requires he kneel before his subjects. The bars quadrisect his face into a giant ear, an eyeball, another eyeball, and another giant ear.:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee9e853e0970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Skyfall00198" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee9e853e0970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee9e853e0970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Skyfall00198" /></a><br />He&#39;s less of a person than an assemblage of odd-looking sense-organs 
seemingly on display for all and sundry. He may think he looks regal as 
he jealously peers out the rear of his cage, but Minahan&#39;s framing 
suggests that Joffrey misunderstands what&#39;s meant by &quot;the trappings&quot; of royalty here. 
Who is free to move as they please and who is serving time in a gilded 
hot box? </p>
<p>Which brings me to my point: what do all of these characters have in common? They&#39;re all serving time in Tywin Lannister&#39;s royal scheme. Much as you admire Tyrion or detest Cersei and Joffrey, this episode erases all doubts about who has agency in the House Lannister: it&#39;s Tywin and Tywin alone. His children and grandchildren are pawns imprisoned by the moves Tywin plays. <em>Just look at the poor bastards</em>. </p>
<p>But maybe it&#39;s a coincidence that the Lannister brood is shot in a manner suggestive of imprisonment, and maybe other characters with claims to the throne are also shot in a similar fashion. It would be nice if Minahan provided some sort of direct reference for the sake of comparison. Maybe something like this?</p>

By structuring the shots the same, Minahan invites the audience to pay attention to the differences: Joffrey&#39;s vertical elements terminate at hard wooden walls and ceiling, creating a claustrophobic effect amplified by his retracted posturing, as if he wished there were more wall for him to cower before; Dany&#39;s vertical elements extend into open sky, and she stands with her dragon before her and her friends beside her, resulting in a shot as expansive as Joffrey&#39;s is confining. Same structure, similarly stationed subjects, but these shots convey vastly different messages about the &quot;service&quot; required by the throne.</p>

We normally think of a bakery as a business, for example, but isn’t it actually a place where people bake things? One can imagine a bakery operating under many different economic systems. The examples multiply. A clothing retailer is a place where people come to get their clothes. A convenience store exists to provide people with easy access to frequently used items. A car factory exists to make cars. Even a bank exists primarily to intermediate between people’s different financial priorities (e.g., saving vs. spending), rather than to make money as such. All of those things are typically “run like a business” in Western countries, but that doesn’t mean that they directly “are” businesses. Only one type of pursuit is inherently a business: hedge funds. Hedge funds avowedly exist for no other purpose than to turn money into more money. They are indifferent to the means by which that is accomplished — they will buy and sell anything, from an oil drum to a government bond to a complex bet to pay out if a certain asset reaches a certain price. For all the advanced math and physics deployed, the basic logic is simple. Buy low, sell high — minimize your costs while maximizing your revenue. That’s what it means to run something “like a business.” John Holbo appreciates the overkill: Defenders of ‘traditional marriage’ insist 1) that their position is, well … traditional; wisdom of the Judeo-Christian tradition, the history of Western Civilization, etc. etc.; 2) they are not bigots. They are tolerant of homosexuality, and the rights of homosexuals, etc. etc. Maybe they watch the occasional episode of “Will and Grace”, in syndication (even if they didn’t watch it back when it started.) They are careful to distance themselves from those Westboro Baptist Church lunatics, for example. It’s gotten to the point where one of the main, mainstream arguments against same-sex marriage is that legalizing it would amount to implying that those opposing it are bigots. Since they are not just bigots (see above), anything that would make them seem like bigots must be wrong. Ergo, approving same-sex marriage would be a mistake. Certainly striking down opposition to it as ‘lacking a rational basis’ would be a gross moral insult to non-bigoted opponents of same-same marriage. This ‘anything that implies we are bigots must be wrong’ argument has problems. But that’s old news. Here’s the new argument. Grant, for argument’s sake, that contemporary arguments against same-sex marriage have been scrubbed free of bigotry. Doesn’t it follow that these arguments must not be traditional but, somehow, quite new? Some days I'm reminded of why I started blogging by the very people who encouraged me to do so. This is one of those days.</span></a></div>
