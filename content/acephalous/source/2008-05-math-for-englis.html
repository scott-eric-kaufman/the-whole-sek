<p>Just FYI, as many of our undergrads know, &quot;walking in graduation&quot; and &quot;finishing the degree&quot; are two very separate entities... and one of my friends walked last spring with a completely finished dissertation; when she didn&#39;t make finalist for any of her VAP positions and was offered some TAships in the writing program, she sat on the revisions and just didn&#39;t file that year. Nobody official said anything about it or anything. She was all done with everything and had a final printed-out version and everything, she just didn&#39;t walk it over to the library yet. </p>

<p>So I would vote for #2, unless the plan of hanging on the Little Womedievalist&#39;s coattails works out. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the longer you wait, the longer the malevolent forces of the universe could send you another situation with THE LIBRARY or other bureaucratic snafu.</p></span>

<p><em>will you be charged tuition for the semester in which you file?</em></p>

<p>I will ... but since they don&#39;t charge grad students for Summer work, I&#39;ve already paid it.</p>

<p><em>if you *actually* finish in June, you should spent the Summer doing other things</em></p>

<p>Yes, like revising my slop into something publishable ... which, given recent events, is much more pressing than I thought.  I mean, really, as I told Sisyphus, my dissertation&#39;s &quot;there&quot; in a &quot;done dissertation&quot; sense, but it&#39;s not &quot;<em>there</em>&quot; yet.</p>

<p><em>if #2, when will the degree be conferred? this might affect getting a job stuff</em></p>

<p>The position I&#39;ve lined up only requires I be done before the Fall quarter begins, which I will be if I file in the Summer. </p>

<p><em>do you do a defense?</em></p>

<p>NO!  But I wish I did, since there&#39;s nothing ever in the entirety of my existence I&#39;m more prepared to defend.  Seriously, at this point, I <em>want</em> to defend it, because I&#39;ll probably never be more qualified to defend anything else in my entire life.</p>

<p>Morfydd:</p>

<p><em>What&#39;s the downside?</em></p>

<p>Actually, that&#39;s why I posted this so open-endedly.  I can&#39;t see any, and just wanted to make sure I wasn&#39;t overlooking something obvious.</p>

<p><em>If there is a down side, would you qualify for COBRA? It would be expensive, but less so than self-insurance.</em></p>

<p>COBRA&#39;s an option, yes, but it&#39;s an expensive one.  Basically, I&#39;d be working to pay for coverage, whereas in an ideal world I&#39;d do more than break even.  </p>

<p><em>Also, what about the Little Womedievalist? Could you be covered under her insurance?</em></p>

<p>Sadly, I wouldn&#39;t qualify.  The UAW&#39;s made strides since I&#39;ve been here, but spousal coverage still ain&#39;t included in the package.  (I spent a few years on the other side of this, trying to get her insured, but to no avail.  Given the budget cuts the past few years, and well, there&#39;s no shot of pushing it through.)</p>

<p>Sisyphus:</p>

<p><em>Hey, I was just going to ask you all about your graduation plans ... are you walking in the ceremony? When&#39;s the big party? And can you really photoshop a mortarboard onto the headless Lenin statue?</em></p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t planning on walking until my mother informed me of THE GREAT FINANCIAL WINDFALL* it&#39;d entail.  So now I think I&#39;ll walk.  As for what I&#39;ll wear ... I&#39;m going out as I came in, <em>i.e.</em> headless and stupid, so yes, I&#39;ll Lenin up the place.</p>

<p><em>So I would vote for #2, unless the plan of hanging on the Little Womedievalist&#39;s coattails works out.</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m actually going for both, I think.  Keeping the insurance, heading on the market this year, but having SECRET FAITH that the wife with her SUPERIOR SKILLS and EXPERT KNOWLEDGE will provide me coattails enough to ride on.</p>

<p>*Jews.  They value education.  Who knew?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-114929812-content"><p>I defended at the end of last summer, and that worked out for me.  I probably could have gotten done by the end of spring quarter if I had to, but with no job as of April, I decided hiding out in school for the summer was not such a bad option.  There were no consequences for me to finishing in September rather than June, since the position I did end up with started in October.  Insurance-wise, I got GradMed for the month or so inbetween.</p>

<p>Another issue that is perhaps important: Does the university consider you to be the resident of your apartment, or is The Little Womedievalist included?  In other words, if you&#39;re no longer a student, will you both get booted out?</p></span>

<p>You neglected the most compelling advantage of #1, though, that being that whatever malevolent force that haunts your life in an evident attempt to keep you from ever finishing your diss will have less time to work.  I can hardly wait to see what will happen to the &quot;all done&quot; dissertation.  Something like the global paper-eating microbe in Lem&#39;s <i>Memoirs Found in a Bathtub</i> perhaps.</p></span>

<p><em>You don&#39;t even have to defend your dissertation? Why oh why have you been writing / revising it all this time?</em></p>

<p>You know, after I lost the revised version of my first chapter, I did something very much like this.

<p>Unless you&#39;re an incompetent, or one of your committee members has an ax to grind, a thesis defense should be a cakewalk: at that point, you are the world expert on your topic and the only way they should be able to trip you up is by asking you about things -- theories, implications, topics -- that aren&#39;t actually part of the dissertation. I have heard horror stories of both incompetence and grinding axes, though.</p>

<p>In my case I got out without one because the requirement was added on after I came into the department, so I was grandfathered out of it. Plus I was already working full-time, fifteen hundred miles from campus.</p></span>

<p>My oral qualifying examination would be a case in point.  I did horribly.  One day I&#39;ll tell that story.  (If I haven&#39;t already.  I don&#39;t think I have.)  But the dissertation defense would be different, I think, because I know my material.  I think the only thing likely to trip me up would be the broad questions about other criticism of the novels and stories I&#39;m working on.  I&#39;ve a terrible memory for names, and in most cases, it&#39;s been so long since I did the &quot;deep background&quot; that I&#39;ve dust-binned everyone who didn&#39;t make it into the dissertation itself.</p>

<p>Or, with all the revisions, not remembering what is and isn&#39;t in the current versions -- but I could speak intelligently about all parties involved, so that wouldn&#39;t be an issue.  </p>

<p><em>I am willing to attack your dissertation so that you can defend it.</em></p>

<p>I might take you up on that offer.  Sort of like a public stoning, only in slow-motion, and captured forever ...</p></span>

<p>Me, too. It&#39;s the one time in my graduate career that I&#39;m absolutely sure my advisor went to the wall for me. (though I was, without a doubt, one of the most marginal students ever to finish; I suspect I set a new standard for &quot;adequate&quot; which stands to this day.) But the dissertation was another matter entirely: not as interesting or as thoughtful as yours, by a long shot, but I was going places none of my advisors ever had and I knew my stuff.</p></span>

<p>Four? Just four? No wonder you had trouble with the defense. I didn&#39;t feel ready until I&#39;d been working on it for at least six, and didn&#39;t actually finish until I had nine years of dissertating under my belt.</p></span>

<p>On the insurance/summer question, don&#39;t be stupid.  Get your entire committee to sign off on the thing as soon as you&#39;re done in June, then just don&#39;t submit the paperwork to the grad school office (or wherever) until the end of August.

<p>Same here.  In the end, I couldn&#39;t even remember the author of a book I&#39;d written a tome on not two quarters previous, so I think they could tell my brain was shot.</p>

<p><em>But the dissertation was another matter entirely: not as interesting or as thoughtful as yours, by a long shot, but I was going places none of my advisors ever had and I knew my stuff.</em></p>

<p>I don&#39;t think my dissertation&#39;s going to be that interesting; or, at the very least, the introduction&#39;s going to more interesting than the chapters, for reasons I&#39;ll explain at some future date.  (Some connections are sounder the bigger they are, so the close-readings in the chapters sort of work against me, I think.)</p>

<p>But yes, I certainly know my material better than, well, maybe two or three other people on the planet?  </p>

<p><em>Will I have to read it, or can I just say that it sucks like analytic philosophy and neoclassical economics?</em></p>

<p>I&#39;d <em>prefer</em> you read it, but I won&#39;t insist.  </p>

<p><em>you&#39;d better walk or I will think less of you. Don&#39;t pull this &quot;oh, I&#39;m too cool and take my education too for granted to actually go through the ceremonial recognition of my completing my doctorate&quot; nonsense.</em></p>

<p>Scott&#39;s Mom hearts Dr. B.  The only sound argument is that it&#39;s not for me, it&#39;s for everybody else, and I appreciate that.  I <em>still</em> don&#39;t want to have to sit around hearing someone read the phone-book -- the analogy verges on the literal here -- but I&#39;ll do it.</p></span>

<p>Don&#39;t forget the wonders of modern technology: bring a camera and take silly pictures of each other while waiting for your name to be called, text each other on your phone ... or live blog it for the website! Forget the stupid beach ball everyone confiscates; bring a Gameboy or whatever the latest minigamer thing is. </p>

<p>Or, go old school and just bring a flask. Time is what you make of it, and if after all that education you can&#39;t even cause trouble and amuse yourself, then you have no Inner Resources. Heh.</p></span>

When something terrible happens, a small part of me—both in the mental age it represents and its proportion relative to my overall response—wishes Superman were real. Ongoing humanitarian crises in Myanmar? Load Kent like a pack mule and send him in. Thousands of Chinese slowly suffocating in rubble? Have the Man of Steel put his X-ray vision to good use. Who doesn't harbor the childish desire to live in a world where the laws of physics can be violated in the interests of justice? Especially when you read an article like this: According to Zeke Poutine, officer in the &quot;Not on Our Watch&quot; Darfur activist group, [a vandal] shouted racial slurs while he trashed [Camp Darfur]. The Camp was rebuilt, but copycat attacks by others followed. But if Camp Darfur has its janjaweed, it has its guardians, too. For shortly after the raids began, a Better World visitor who’d learned a lot about Sudan’s genocide from the Camp called a group of his to the island, to offer their protection. Because the Camp exists not in our world, but in Second Life, the group that came to the aid of the refugees looks like this: Seriously: And that’s why Camp Darfur is now under the vigilant eye of the Green Lantern Core, a band of superheroes who patrol Second Life with masks, tights, and magic lamps. So I suppose I do understand Second Life. The allure of agency is difficult to ignore. What can we do about Darfur? Volunteer time. Donate money. What can they do about virtual Darfur? Defend it with alien technology. Why be Jon Stewart when you could be John Stewart? The unintended consequence of unleashing the Green Lantern Core in Second Life is how revealing it is of a particular kind of political agency. The power rings from which the members of the Core draw their strength are fueled by willpower. The more the wearer possesses, the greater the power of the ring. If he wishes really hard, he might just be able to change the world. If I do, reports of a blue and red blur delivering food in Myanmar will surface on the evening news. But I wouldn't hold my breath.</span></a></div>
