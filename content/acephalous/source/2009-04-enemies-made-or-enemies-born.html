Often cited as the founder of Western (or philosophical) Marxism, Lukács can be considered the grandfather of the armchair academic activists who fought the radical fight from tenured positions at illustrious institutions. I only half-kid here: his claim in The Historical Novel (1937) that the role of the literary critic was to examine “the relation between ideology (in the sense of Weltanschauung) and artistic creation” (147) allowed otherwise sedentary scholars to label as revolutionary action an exegesis on Dickensian realism. Anyone whose work analyzed critical or socialist realism, i.e. literature which displayed “the contradictions within society and within the individual context of a dialectical unity,” could consider him or herself a soldier in the Great Class War Against Mystification. Like Susan Sontag, I find his definition of realism—socialist, critical or otherwise—unnecessarily reductive and his dismissiveness of non-realist works short-sighted (if not out-right anti-intellectual). In 1906, the same year Lukács received his Ph.D., was born the man whose work depicted “an idiot’s vegetative existence.” That Samuel Beckett’s novels, plays and poetry trafficked in “human degradation” was reason enough for condemnation: unlike realists novels, which were capable of creating dialectical conversations between singular narratives and the social totality of history, modernist novels wallowed in the singularity of their narrators: Lack of objectivity in the description of the outer world finds its complement in the reduction of reality to a nightmare. Beckett’s Molloy is perhaps the ne plus ultra of this development. (152) If an author grounds that nightmare in “the Aristotelian concept of man as zoon politikon” (151); that is, if an author provides a reference against which the consequences of the actions of social animals can be judged: only then can reader or critic differentiate between the concrete potentialities (what happens) and the abstract potentialities (what the character thought could have happened). Authors who refuse to declare what happened—who mess in the pseudo-realization of abstract potentiality—create readers who will never know from dialectical. They will not be social animals critically examining the societal structuring of their lives through the power of realist narratives; they will be unwitting dupes forever mired in the pathological subjectivity of Molloy, forever sucking pebbles. Their lives, such that they are, will be spent in the Grand Hotel Abyss, which Lukács describes as a beautiful hotel, equipped with every comfort, on the edge of an abyss, of nothingness, of absurdity.

in history, two men—one of whom would say that the other’s life work
represented “the utmost human degradation[:] an idiot’s vegetative
existence”—were born. In 1885, the author of that statement, Marxist
literary critic Georg Lukács, dewombed in Budapest. Often cited as the
founder of Western (or philosophical) Marxism, Lukács can be considered
the grandfather of the armchair academic activists who fought the
radical fight from tenured positions at illustrious institutions. I
only half-kid here: his claim in <em>The Historical Novel</em> (1937) that the role of the literary critic was to examine “the relation between ideology (in the sense of <em>Weltanschauung</em>) and artistic creation” (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-_DoAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=">147</a>)
allowed otherwise sedentary scholars to label as revolutionary action
an exegesis on Dickensian realism.&#0160; Anyone whose work analyzed critical
or socialist realism, <em>i.e.</em> literature which displayed “the
contradictions within society and within the individual context of a
dialectical unity,” could consider him or herself a soldier in the
Great Class War Against Mystification. Like <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=e3qgRrVlEH4C&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=#PPA88,M1">Susan Sontag</a>,
I find his definition of realism—socialist, critical or
otherwise—unnecessarily reductive and his dismissiveness of non-realist
works short-sighted (if not out-right anti-intellectual).</p>
<p>In 1906, the same year Lukács received his Ph.D., was born the man
whose work depicted “an idiot’s vegetative existence.” That Samuel
Beckett’s novels, plays and poetry trafficked in “human degradation”
was reason enough for condemnation: unlike realists novels, which were
capable of creating dialectical conversations between singular
narratives and the social totality of history, modernist novels
wallowed in the singularity of their narrators:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lack of objectivity in the description of the outer

Beckett’s <em>Molloy</em> is perhaps the <em>ne plus ultra</em> of this development. (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=UrCln8TYJMEC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=">152</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>If an author grounds that nightmare in “the Aristotelian concept of man as <em>zoon politikon</em>” (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=UrCln8TYJMEC&amp;pg=PA151">151</a>);
that is, if an author provides a reference against which the
consequences of the actions of social animals can be judged: only then
can reader or critic differentiate between the concrete potentialities
(what happens) and the abstract potentialities (what the character
thought could have happened). Authors who refuse to declare what
happened—who mess in the pseudo-realization of abstract
potentiality—create readers who will never know from dialectical. They
will not be social animals critically examining the societal
structuring of their lives through the power of realist narratives;
they will be unwitting dupes forever mired in the pathological
subjectivity of Molloy, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=sglVtT7_nH4C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=molloy&amp;ei=f9bjScibOIGUkASSucWcDQ&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA93,M1">forever sucking pebbles</a>. Their lives, such that they are, will be spent in the Grand Hotel Abyss, which Lukács describes as</p>

<p>Needless to say, I disagree.</p>
<p>I’ll close on an historical odditiy: not only was Lukács born on
April 13th, so too was the French psychoanalyst and psychoanalytic
theorist, Jacques Lacan. It’s as if the day conspired to give birth to
the thought of Louis Althusser (which, as you can probably guess, is
one part Lukácian, one part Lacanian and three cans of crazy).</p><p>(<em>x-posted</em>.)</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_Roses" rel="nofollow">Bread and Roses</a>, you know.  Although the advance of the anti-work anarcho-socialists has been to eliminate that line &quot;No more the drudge and idler, ten that toil where one reposes&quot;, which annoyed me from the first time I heard it.  The point is not to put the one idler while nine other people are working to work.  Distributional issues aside, that only gets you 1/10 better production, and really, why bother.  The point is to make it so that nine people can be idle while the one person who really wants to work for some reason can work so productively that he or she can support all of them.<br />

At least I assume it must be terrible, because sometime last quarter they painted that step bright yellow, like so: Though drastic, this measure failed to alert these budding titans of finance to the existence of the step. One can imagine them tumbling like Wojnarowiczian buffalo off that 12-inch cliff into a valley strewn with the detritus of the upwardly mobile (a cracked iPhone here, a smashed PDA there). So in order to save the MBA from extinction, someone did some anti-Magrittian sloganeering at the walkway's end: Alas! Still the former Future Business Leaders of America tumbled to their twisted ankles! How do I know? Because of what I saw when I walked by there today: Every few feet the entire length of the building this step announces its existence. Perhaps now these geniuses can stop worrying about their walking and get back to saving our economy from themselves.</span></a></div>
