<p>Weekdays I'm modest to boot.&nbsp; </p>

<p>So I'll spend Saturday &quot;sharing.&quot;&nbsp; The first thing I'll share is that today's my brother's birthday.&nbsp; He won't answer my phone calls or reply to emails or even respond to <a href="http://theinnersanctum.typepad.com/the_inner_sanctum/2006/02/beware_the_new_.html#comment-14369113">my</a> <a href="http://theinnersanctum.typepad.com/the_inner_sanctum/2006/02/beware_the_new_.html#comment-14372674">comments</a> on <a href="http://theinnersanctum.typepad.com/the_inner_sanctum/">his blog</a> . . . but I wish him a happy birthday nonetheless.&nbsp; What can I say?&nbsp; I put the &quot;big&quot; in &quot;big brother.&quot;</p>

<p>I've been listening to the newish <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB000B0WOEO">Fiona Apple</a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" /> album.&nbsp; The cover disgusts me in ways I can't explain.&nbsp; They have to do with this photoshopped image of a human and a lotus plant which was ostensibly a woman who'd been infected by some parasite . . . and I'd link to it but I don't want that image back in my head.&nbsp; If I said that that image stole countless sleeping hours from me I wouldn't be exaggerating.&nbsp; Sometimes images lodge in my head and I can't fight them out for the life of me.&nbsp; Even my patented sleep technology* can't defeat it.&nbsp; So no link.&nbsp; But you can see an unhealthy approximation on the Fiona Apple album.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Kevin's nominated me for &quot;<a href="http://www.slanttruth.kaelliott.com/2006/02/worst_soon_to_b.html">Worst Soon to be Professor</a>.&quot;&nbsp; That's only fair.&nbsp; I'm the force responsible for <a href="http://www.michaelberube.com/">Michael</a>'s dangerous terribility.&nbsp; Without me people'd think Chomsky <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/survey/vote.asp">a greater danger</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Two of my three Honors Dissertation advisors have emailed drafts of their current work this week.&nbsp; Sadly this makes me feel like an adult.&nbsp; But it also makes me feel like an undergraduate again.&nbsp; I've commented on both Pat McGee and John Protevi's latest work . . . but I can't send them my comments until I'm absolutely positively convinced that what I've written isn't complete crap.&nbsp; I'm sure this is something I'll overcome someday.&nbsp; But for now I still idolize those two and can't bring myself to send my impressions.&nbsp; Soon though.&nbsp; (I'm fairly certain both read me regularly.&nbsp; I hope they get this far and understand why I haven't responded yet.)</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://lawandletters.blogspot.com/">Belle</a> took the bar exam this week and thinks she passed.&nbsp; Congratulations are in order!&nbsp; So cough 'em up!&nbsp; (What can I say?&nbsp; I'm a believer.&nbsp; If people as intelligent as she manifestly is think they passed then they passed.&nbsp; The exceptions to this rule are so rare they only prove it.)</p>

<p>*One<span class="postbody"> time at baseball camp they brought in an instructor to help us &quot;visualize&quot; our swing.&nbsp; They'd
taped us swinging from three angles, stuck us in front of a VCR and
told us to memorize what we were doing and the order in which we were
doing it.&nbsp; &quot;Lift front foot and begin to slide it slowly&quot; &amp;c.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Then</span>
a hitting instructor finds the flaws in it, tells us how to fix them,
and informs us that we're to &quot;visualize&quot; our &quot;perfect&quot; swing over and
over and over again.&nbsp; To this day it knocks me out after about four iterations.&nbsp; Sometimes I
vary it by thinking about my jump shot, but really, the swing is solid gold. 
I'm like Wolverine: thirty seconds (alright, more like three minutes)
and I'm out like a light.&nbsp; 
But only if I can concentrate. If I'm sick and/or drunk, I'm
lifting my right foot, releasing my left hand, launching the bat
instead of the ball . . .

		<span id="comment-14374764-content"><p>I love your faith in me. For the record though, for aspiring lawyers everywhere, (and since lawyers always give qualified, non-committal statements) I will say I think I did comparatively okay in the sense that I 1) didn&#39;t puke, 2) didn&#39;t pass out, and 3) didn&#39;t completely break down, and that typically, attitude is better than anything else on the bar. But I&#39;ll take the &quot;I think I passed!&quot; Just don&#39;t hold me to it when the results come in (which I will freaking not care about, since I&#39;m going to grad school!) </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad to be back, and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re done with grading, and yes, glad you&#39;re being self-indulgent and writing whatever comes to mind (better you than The Troll of Sorrow). The exercise of writing is important--and your faithful readers will get you and stick with you. Hell, not like I always understand your posts filed under the categories &quot;Academia, Dissertation, Evolution, Literary Theory&quot;--but by gum, I read and I try.  Though I dug last night&#39;s. Knowing that you&#39;re Jewish, I understood who you were mocking. Not like Prince Harry with the Swastika. (what was up with that? And why do the British have &quot;Imperialist and Colonialist&quot; theme parties? Can&#39;t they just show up in tees and jeans as themselves then?)<br />

		<span id="comment-14375634-content"><p>There are people like me who do in fact read you on the weekend (hi, have you checked your viewership count?) and who actually appreciate these sorts of posts because of their non-academic nature (hey, i don&#39;t know a lot of stuff and you&#39;re kind of over my head sometimes), and, at the same time, there are people who know you to be overtly anti-discriminative on every level so...</p>

<p>Why apologize?</p>

<p>Academically, you&#39;re what some of us aspire to.  Could we sit in a room as a mostly muted TA yet still maintain such an underlying pedagogical presence?  Unlikely.   </p>

<p>Personally, could we (I) have any more momentary camraderie with you in light of the fact that you&#39;re listening to the album that pretty much defined our (my) past six months?  </p>

<p>I should go to bed.  But listen and re-listen and love track #4...&#39;i am likely to miss the main event...if i stop to cry and complain again...&quot;</p></span>

		<span id="comment-14385406-content"><p>So sorry Adam--an unfunny remark that came off terribly. I should have limited the snarky commentary to the British monarchy or Prince Harry, and even then the monarchy and Harry aren&#39;t responsible for the actions of King James I or Sir Robert Clive.  Nor did I mean to imply that there is a monolithic British culture/people to which all actions, historical, present and future can be attributed--any more than there is a monolithic &quot;American&quot; people (despite what the melting pot theory says). Again, many apologies for an ill-considered late night flippant remark.</p></span>

Failing to be funny on the other hand...  Well, suffice it to say that too few of us have any childhood memories of immigrant Jews to provide context!  Still, better to make a bad joke than no joke at all.</p></span>

I knew there was a reason I never posted it those many moons ago. So I've banished it below the fold. Too many layers of irony confuse the casual reader. Plus I've gotten some hits I'm not altogether comfortable with from some sites whose readers lack critical acumen. Or basic reading skills. So begone! However, this raises an interesting issue, one which I'll tackle tonight if I have energy enough after yet another marathon grading session. With this many essays, the pile never seems to shrink . . . UPDATE: As I wrote Rebecca, the more interesting issue [alluded to above] is how to turn racism against racists without seeming like you're making fun of the racist's target. I can't bend it back without seeming, to the casual reader, racist myself. How are we supposed to mock absurd views? I kind of think we can't. I'd say that's the last time I'm going to openly mock neo-Nazis, but I doubt it will be. What I need to figure out is how to do so properly. Here you find many truth Jews kill to hide. Page work like I ask you Jew question and you don't know so I give Jew answer. You will like so much as Jew hates. First question is &quot;Why do Jew pick nose?&quot; Concede! First answer is &quot;Cheaper than tissue.&quot; Second question is &quot;Why Jew nose so big?&quot; Stop! Second answer is &quot;Because air free.&quot; Third question is &quot;What do Jew do when Jew friend leaves?&quot; Shut it! Answer is &quot;Check couch.&quot; Fourth question is &quot;What most disgusting about Jew clothes?&quot; This my boot! Answer is &quot;Jew occupant.&quot; Final question is &quot;Why no Jew eat pork?&quot; I will shoot! Answer is &quot;Torah prohibits cannibalism.&quot; Now you know Jew truth. Please no share with Jew friends. Please not have Jew friends first. You kick them hard they cry Jew tears. They not mind they sell for maximum profit to Jews who not can cry! [Addendum #1: Hate Speech Theater will focus exclusively on anti-semitic &quot;humor.&quot; I'm reproducing (with minor and I hope amusing variations) the stupidities I stumble across when I channel Deborah E. Lipstadt . I would link to the pages I mock . . . but I don't feel like contributing to their hit count.] [Addendum #2: Since I fear that sarcasm and tone and intent are often lost on the Internets, let me add that the joke here is that I've transmogrified the speech of Neo-Nazis into what I've heard from the mouths of elderly Yinglish-speakers. 'Cause what would infuriate a Neo-Nazi more than being jewified by a secular Jew? Damn it. The possibility of misunderstanding has completely ruined the joke. I suppose anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-racism can't be subtle.]</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/all_scribes_uti.html"><span><strong>A Lexigraphical Lament about Probationer Prosody</strong> All scribes utilize lexicons. Roget's regnant tome monopolizes the matriculant market. Neophytes congregate in monograph outlets to procure a reprint. They disembark at their domicile and allocate Peter Roget's linguistical treatise a bearing on a transversal above their desktop computer. There it hunkers until a pedagogue implores them to formulate a polemic. Then the prentice wordsmith extracts it. The pupil employs it to ameliorate his pedestrian prose. With hubris he asseverates the eminence of his phraseological aptitude: &quot;My profiency with palaver is unparalleled. Scrutinize my incomparable prose if you don't accredit me!&quot; The ensuing evening his educator ensconces himself at his trestle to assess his august pupil's critique. After he appraises it he thrusts his extremities on his coutenance. He again cognizes that graduands should not be sanctioned to retain Roget's opus because proprietorship of aforementioned reprehensible receptacle of lexical surrogates elicits maximal keening from all preceptors. &quot;Why!&quot; the mentor declaims at his articulatory apex. &quot;Why must charges importune their prose with exorbitant diction?&quot;</span></a></div>
