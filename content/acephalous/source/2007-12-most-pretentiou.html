<p>You have been nominated mostly for your association with the Neoromantic Oxford club (dr. Josephina Kugelmass, the Zizek fans and Roman Polanski)combined with a rather confused, cryptic and elitist style that we noticed in several texts.</p></span>

<p>Look that may be correct, but the presence of An Und Fur Sich, the Valve, Kugelmass and Long Sunday on his blogroll indicates that he didn&#39;t manage to overcome classic pretension, and in this sense he deserves the nomination.<br />

All we can do now is hope Dejan and company <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/03/grading.html" rel="nofollow">learn what words mean</a>.  Anything is possible, but I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath.</p>

<p>J.S. Nelson, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve always aimed for.  Half the posts up here are classic self-deflations.  I&#39;m always surprised when people think I have airs.  Do they not read my words?  (Or do they, too, not know what words mean?)</p>

<p>ben, I&#39;m fairly certain no one will mistake me for the father.  I lack both motive and opportunity, what with not having left the house in over eleven months.  (I&#39;m slowly being replaced by Asian versions of myself, according to some of the other folk at the shower.)</p>

<p>John, I&#39;ve come to believe there&#39;s a direct correlation between how funny someone thinks they are and the sound opinions of rational minds.  This would be a case in point.</p>

<p>Ahistoricality, I would, like one of David Foster Wallace&#39;s <em>Horrible Men</em>, run from the bedroom declaring Victory for the Forces of Democracy and Freedom!</p></span>

(Need I remind you of my disgraceful Honors Thesis?) This was about the same time music meant something to me—surely you remember? Before you bored of life and its trappings? Back when everything radiated raw, brittle vitality? (Of course you remember. You were young once too.) So you can imagine my elation when I discovered Pynchon had penned liner notes for some band I'd never heard of. Music and Pynchon? What could be better? Nothing. Nothing could have been better. So I spent the better part of two months tracking down Lotion's Nobody's Cool. (This was before the Internet was the Internet we know and love. The only available options were CDNOW and a plane ticket to someplace with a decent record store.) I finally landed a copy through a book distributor I'd befriended who lived in New York but was passing through Baton Rouge on his way to a family wedding in Bunkie. This septuagenarian ventured into some independent shop in the Village for me. Only now do I understand his sacrifice. Point being, eventually I landed a copy of Nobody's Cool and, in my unbiased view, it was the best album ever. I listened to nothing but it for months and months and then I fell for this girl hard. You know the rest of the story. I lent her the album in a sad attempt to impress. She declined my bait. I never saw the album again. In the years since, I've longed to hear it again. Was it everything I remember it to be? (Surely not.) Was I suckered into love by Pynchon's imprimatur? (Most certainly.) Is the thing any good? I didn't know ... until my best friend from high school visited a few weeks back. Said he had a surprise for me. Can you guess what it was? Of course you can. (My readers are no fools.) (Although they waste too much time here to be taken too seriously.) What does it sound like? Judge for yourself.

(He wanted to be sure he could spot me in the crowd.) Intrigued, I took him up on his offer. The results are ... interesting. A search for my full name, bookended by quotation marks, returns: a photo of Eric Lott on the beach Scott McLemee's Simpson's self some books McLemee bought for Kotsko in Canada a few years in the header of the Iranian Supreme Leader's blog Kugelmass' head And that's on the first page. Keep flipping and you'll find: Clancy Ratliff a woman in a vagina costume Chad Orzel [Thanks, Brad] Salma Hayek an angry duck Salma Hayek Brad DeLong Salma Hayek a woman in a vagina costume ben wolfson Salma Hayek ben wolfson with an inflatable shield Anthony Paul Smith Butters Salma Hayek Something must've gone horribly wrong with Google. I don't even like Salma Hayek, much less—what do you mean &quot;Page Rank&quot;? This post will do what? Seriously? Crap.</span></a></div>
