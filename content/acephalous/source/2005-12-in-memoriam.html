At first we thought you were a racist because you attacked the black architect who was working on our house. Later we learned that you hated men with mustaches regardless of race.

We would run after you. You would stop to make sure we were chasing you and then when we were three feet away you would dart another half mile. You would always wait for us to catch up before you would bolt again. You didn't want to leave us. You only wanted to be chased. Once you ran into a stable and scared some horses and that was awesome. Eventually we decided to put a long leash around your neck so you could not dash so far so fast. We knew you loved the game but we did not want you to die playing it. You hated cats but you loved Tigger. There you are barking at a cat outside with Tigger riding shotgun. You did not know Tigger was a cat. We would think you were asleep and then all of the sudden we would be hit by the slobbery Tigger you had flung at us. We knew you wanted us to take him from you so you could growl and wrestle with him. We knew you loved Tigger so we decided not to tell you he was a cat. You were an awesome dog. When you developed canine epilepsy we discovered you loved cheese. You would only take your phenobarbital if we wrapped it in cheese and so we did. Then the seizures stopped and we were happy. Mom wanted to keep you alive so I could say goodbye this Christmas but you could not stop throwing up the cheese with your phenobarbital in it and started having seizures again. I know how selfish it sounds but I wanted to say goodbye and I wish you could have held out a little longer. I know you wanted to see me again and were sorry you could not. I know I wanted to see you again and am devestated I cannot. Mom and Dad were with you at the end so I know you felt safe and comfortable when you left us. I wish I had had a chance to say goodbye but I am glad you do not suffer anymore. You were the best dog ever." />

Anyway, this is the first time I&#39;ve commented and it&#39;s because you made me CRY.</p>

<p>That was a lovely tribute to an awesome dog.  I hope Pokey is playing the &quot;almost got me&quot; game in eternity.</p></span>

<p>I&#39;m at a loss for words right now. I had to put my dog of ten years (a stray that I found on the side of the road in Indiana) to sleep the day after my birthday this year. I don&#39;t mean to try to undermine your loss and your pain. I just want you to know that I understand how you must feel right now. I&#39;m crying as I write this. Your memoriam to Pokey brings up too many memories for me. But I&#39;m also crying because I can tell when a dog really means something to someone. </p>

<p>Best wishes to you and your family.</p></span>

But again I must say my dog was amazing and if I have anything to do with it, he will never be forgotten. He came into our lives by chance and he left us with our hearts filled and our minds stuffed with memories. He is forever loved!</p></span>

I don&#39;t believe in heaven for humans -- we&#39;ve done so little to deserve it -- but I believe our dearly departed dogs and cats and birds and lizards and fish and assorted rodents are all enjoying each other&#39;s company on a far, far better plane of existence than this....

It was then forwarded to UCI's Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity which—you guessed it—is &quot;responsible for the University's compliance with federal and state laws and University policies and procedures regarding discrimination, retaliation and sexual harassment.&quot; I'm interested in hearing from the person who forwarded this to the Office of the President. Did he or she think I handled the situation inappropriately? Can he or she suggest how I could have handled it better? All recommendations must be filed in the comments section before 10:00 A.M. Friday morning, as that's when I have to meet with an OEOD investigator.</span></a></div>

The place is Louisiana State University. The dippy fellow with the faded Mets cap and frazzled look following Pat McGee to his office is Yours Truly. I wanted to talk to him about why I'd received a B on a paper I'd written about Irish nationalism in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man . As we walked down the hall, he asked &quot;What criticism have you read?&quot; I mumbled my appreciation for William Gass (whose work I had learned of via the most confusing editorial assignment in the history of American literature ) and Camille Paglia (whose work I did not learn about while reading Playboy for the articles). To which he responded: &quot;I meant criticism about Joyce's novel.&quot; Now you see why I earned a B on that particular essay. The point of encumbering you with this trivia?[1] Today I learned that the Queen of Off the Cuff Cultural Studies has resumed writing her column for Salon with (predictably) a review of Madonna's latest album. The atrophy of her once prodigious talent saddens me. The article actually contains the following sentences: That's not what we got—though you'd never know it from the gushing reviews, which applauded the CD for achieving Madonna's purported aim of making people dance. My blood boiled at this insulting reduction of dance music to gymnastics—mere recreational aerobics. I for one do not dance to dance music; disco for me is a lofty metaphysical mode that induces contemplation. The woman I once thought one of the best minds of my time said &quot;disco for me is a lofty metaphysical mode that induces contemplation.&quot; What? I can barely parse that sentence, much less make sense of its absurd implications. How can something which is external to you be a mode you experience internally? Maybe something can inspire contemplation of matters metaphysical, but I'm unable to see how something can be a metaphysical mode. By definition, metaphysical modes have a difficult time being. Part and parcel of the whole metaphysical gig, I thought. Paglia apparently disagrees . . . and chose to voice her disagreement in one of the worst sentences ever written. But not the worst. One commenter topped her in a lucid reply entitled &quot;Camille Paglia is a tight ass&quot;: This lady should loosen her sphincter and shake her ass . . . . . . but preferably not in that order. [1] According to the OED, &quot;encumber&quot; means &quot;to hamper, embarrass with a clog or burden.&quot; I'm not sure whether it's the emphasis on the word &quot;with,&quot; the incongruous nature of clogs and burdens or the idea of someone embarrassing me with a clog or a burden, but I haven't spit on my keyboard in quite some time, so I thought I'd share.</span></a></div>
