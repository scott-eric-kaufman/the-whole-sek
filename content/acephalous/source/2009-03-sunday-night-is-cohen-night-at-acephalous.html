	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
			<p>There are two kinds of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohen" title="Because all fanbases should be named after Hebrew puns.">Cohenim</a>: those who like
everything up to and including <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002AZY/diesekoschmar-20">Songs of Love and Hate</a></em> and those who prefer
everything from <em>Songs of Love and Hate</em> onwards. That particular
album divides fans because it&#39;s the last one with real instruments; it&#39;s the last
one with backup singers who complement the song from the background; it&#39;s
the first one in which the now-patented Cohen-growl appeared. It&#39;s actually my favorite
album for the last reason—the voice matches the songs and the
instrumentation matches the voice. For example:</p>

<center><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9aRKZFR5imM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9aRKZFR5imM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" /></object></center>

<p>But as his voice grizzled, his production values soared: shiny synthesizers
and slick studio singers who were mixed as loudly (if not louder) than Cohen
himself. It was almost as if he were trying to compensate for the rasp with
the musical equivalent of a sickeningly sweet cough syrup. I like the
songwriting on the later albums, but the songs are better when performed by
other people. To the extent that the dead can own things, Jeff Buckley owns
&quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AratTMGrHaQ">Hallelujah</a>.&quot;&#0160; (Do yourself a favor and <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/on-flatching-cack.html">lick on that clink</a>.)</p><p></p><p>

Recent Cohen concerts are dangerous affairs: they could be like that <em>Austin City Limits</em> appearance from a few years (decades?) back, when he sat there with a guitar and a Lyle Lovett and sang

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0112796dd4c828a4-content"><p>Thanks for hipping me to some of Cohen&#39;s music, SEK -- I&#39;ve got to say I don&#39;t fit into either of your categories. (Though as a brand-new listener to Cohen I guess &quot;Cohenim&quot; is not a category that includes me anyways.) Of the three albums I&#39;ve been listening to I like &quot;Songs of LC&quot; (pre-L&amp;H) and &quot;New Skins&quot; (post-L&amp;H) both pretty equally, and both a whole lot more than I like Love and Hate. Listening to both of those records I feel like Cohen&#39;s persona comes through the speakers pretty fully formed -- Love and Hate is comparatively cryptic -- it&#39;s like I&#39;m listening to a cipher with a golden voice.</p></span>

<p>Regarding &quot;Hallelujah,&quot; it&#39;s an OK Cohen song, to be sure (though I&#39;m partial to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czQoGSYBeHU" rel="nofollow">Suzanne</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhfSdq2R9IA&feature=related" rel="nofollow">That&#39;s no way to say goodbye</a>), and I&#39;m sure there aren&#39;t too many other ways to make it work besides Buckley&#39;s (I&#39;m also sure that, having heard it, I don&#39;t need to hear it again for a long time). </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t understand how some things become classics and others don&#39;t. I don&#39;t know why &quot;Last thing on my mind&quot; is Tom Paxton&#39;s greatest hit, when &quot;Outward Bound&quot; is one of the greatest love songs in the English language (I do understand why &quot;Marvelous Toy&quot; was his second most popular song, though), or why Garnet Rogers isn&#39;t played on every country station on the continent, why Ellis Paul doesn&#39;t have the cachet that Cohen does. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t decide if that makes me old and sad, or young and callow.</p></span>

It&#39;s an interesting contrast to Marianne Faithful whose heroin-ravaged voice was ill served by synth-pop and faux-reggae arrangements for years (though certain songs like &quot;The Ballad of Lucy Jordan&quot; work well with their Eno-synthy music), but in more recent albums (<i>Before the Poison</i> and <i>20th Century Blues</i>) has achieved true brilliance with more spare, acoustic music.</p>

<p>On concerts, have you listened to the <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101034642" rel="nofollow">recent Cohen concert</a> that NPR podcast and that Bob Boilen raved about?  I haven&#39;t had a chance to yet, but it sounds promising.  On &quot;Hallelujah,&quot; Buckley&#39;s great, but I do honestly prefer both <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEOZLQ3d1FI" rel="nofollow">John Cale&#39;s</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmbQEQltOwM" rel="nofollow">Rufus Wainwright&#39;s</a> versions.</p>

<p>Finally, I&#39;m not entirely sure what Adam&#39;s talking about, but I hope that everyone will come out to see my forthcoming alt-country Cohen cover band, Children of the Cohen.</p></span>

<p>Well, that depends... is it a &quot;known fact&quot; that the Tolkein pronunciation is &quot;Ro-Han&quot;? (I have a vested interest, obviously. My name is pronounced to rhyme with &quot;Cohen.&quot; One of my life&#39;s FAQ is &quot;Oh, were you named for those riders in Tolkein?&quot;)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0112796f0db228a4-content"><p>The first assignment I give students in my songwriting class is find a song that has an especially strong synergy between words and music. About half the time, it seems, someone picks &quot;Hallelujah.&quot; They bring in either the Buckley or Cale versions--it&#39;s a pretty even split. A year or so ago someone in class had Cohen&#39;s version on her iPod, and for some reason we played that one as well (I think she was claiming that Buckley had done it wrong). Most everyone who was used to the other versions was shocked if not mortified, including me. My first reaction was that it sounded positively sleezy.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve adjusted, I&#39;d say that it&#39;s really a matter of sincerity. Cohen&#39;s is on the line between ironic and insincere, especially for the first couple of verses--it&#39;s not music for Shrek and Fiona to moon around to (I see it&#39;s on the Watchmen soundtrack, which seems like a better fit, though I haven&#39;t seen the movie). Everyone else approaches it with a superabundance of sincerity. They also approach it with the chops to really milk the second half of the verse--it&#39;s a sustained arc that takes more vocal fortitude than your average pop song. So maybe it&#39;s just that Cohen wrote a great song that he&#39;s not well suited to sing, which speaks well of his commitment to songwriting.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how that idea sits with the Cohenim, but it&#39;s a theory.<br />

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0112796f449e28a4-content"><p>Seems most of the Cohen community at the top site for his music, The Leonard Cohen Files, don&#39;t think much of the Jeff Buckley cover of &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. I personally don&#39;t enjoy the Buckley version but it has, clearly, its devotees. It&#39;s been over-marketed and, now, more versions are being heard. </p>

<p>I believe the comment that Cohen&#39;s written a great song for singers is true. </p>

<p>Haven&#39;t yet seen The Watchmen, but I believe it&#39;s the live Cohen recording used for that scene aboard the Owl Ship. Director Zack Snyder had the Allison Crowe version in the movie but found it too sexy and beautiful so switched to Cohen for a more twisted experience.</p>

<p>Whatever unpredictability there was to Leonard Cohen concerts in years past, since he resumed touring last year his performances are consistently wonderful. Great band, and choice song sets. NPR has online a sampling from a recent NYC date.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef011168fc245b970c-content"><p>Wait, SEK, we&#39;re only allowed to like the first three albums (four, including <i>Live Songs</i>) or the last ten?  Huh? And does <i>Blue Alert</i> count as a Leonard Cohen album?  I&#39;m with JPool:  it&#39;s easier to make distinctions by song than by album.  But I don&#39;t see a reason to prefer the folky mode to the campy lounge singer mode or vice versa --it&#39;s all good by me, except maybe <i>Dear Heather</i> and <i>Cohen Live</i>.  Best covers?  Probably Fairport Convention, Jennifer Warnes, Johnny Cash, Rufus Wainwright, and a number of the artists on the <i>I&#39;m Your Fan</i> album.  Weakest covers have got to include Emmylou Harris&#39;s version of &quot;Ballad of the Absent Mare&quot; and some artists on the <i>Tower of Song</i> album.</p>

<p><i>Watchmen</i>, IIRC, uses the original album version.</p></span>

I’m more curious about this: I was fortunate to be mentored by Corrine Glesne, an absolutely wonderful ethnographer (Busier et al., 1997; Glesne, 1989, 1998, 2003; Martin &amp; Glesne, 2002). Do my eyes deceive me, or are those citations meant to substantiate the absolute wonderfulness of Corrine Glesne? Is this a cheap scheme to up the number of times people are cited in professional indexes? If so, how is it nobody’s—wait a minute. I just had an idea. Have I ever told you how awesome you are? I haven’t? Well then, it’s about time that I did. It is my professional opinion that you are awesome. By the authority invested in me by the University of California, I hereby declare that each and every one of you possess more awesomeness than anyone has any right to. You can quote me on that. In fact, I insist that you do. Every time you appeal to your academic ethos, I’d like to see some variation of “Lest you doubt my authority, remember that reputable scholars have attested to my awesomeness (Kaufman 2009).” Feel free to practice in the comments. For obvious reasons, I will x-post this everywhere. The more citations I score, the more reputable I become; and the more reputable I become, the more my stamp of approval’s worth. I think we have ourselves a win-win scenario here. So what are you waiting for? Start practicing already!</span></a></div>
