			<p>Welcome to Part III of my continuing attempt to understand Steven Knapp’s <em>Literary Interest</em>
and come to terms with its implications.&nbsp; (In what follows it’s
possible that I demonstrate a constitutional inability to do either.

<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/08/all_my_vintage_.html#comment-8838125">Commenting</a> on my <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/08/all_my_vintage_.html">second (still muddled) attempt</a> to pin down Knapp’s argument, <a href="http://completelyfutile.blogspot.com/">Adam Stephanides</a> argues
</p>
<blockquote><p>The primary question Knapp is asking in this chapter is

<p>
I read that section under the same assumption and came to the same
conclusion (though I neglected to mention it in that post).&nbsp; My entire
discussion assumed that the point toward which Knapp marched would
marshal against all arguments resembling “the Romantic Argument,” <em>i.e.</em> ones in which the critic rescues the coherence of the intended world at the expense of the author’s intentions.&nbsp; On <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/how_the_marx_brothers_embark_or_steven_knapps_literary_interest_and_its_imp/">The Valve</a>, <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/how_the_marx_brothers_embark_or_steven_knapps_literary_interest_and_its_imp/#3701">HZ</a> forwards a different but not necessarily contradictory interpretation:

they had a a “special kind of representational structure, each of whose
elements acquires, by virtue of its connection with other elements, a

What are we interested in when we are interested in <em>THAT</em>?</p></blockquote>

<p>HZ’s account diminishes the importance of the prescriptive angle
Adam and I believe to be entailed by his local statements.&nbsp; Granted,
assessing these statements outside the global context of <em>Literary Interest</em>
encouraged the speculation that led to my misrepresentating Knapp’s

HZ almost convinces me that Knapp’s interest in “literary interest” is
disinterested, my experience reading Walter Benn Michaels suggests
otherwise.&nbsp; (Not that I think there’s a one-to-one correspondence

Otherwise the entire book would be nothing more than a sophisticated
account of the solipsism any engagement with literature entails:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Literary interest offers an unusually precise and
concentrated analogue of what it is like to be an agent in general. 
For part of what being an agent is (always) like, apparently, is being
caught up in an irreducible oscillation between typicality and
particularity: between (on one side) the forms of action that an agent
must understand in order to make sense of herself as the possible
performer of certain actions, and (on the other side) the concrete
history without which the agent could not distinguish herself from
those who might, otherwise, just as well replace her.&nbsp; And this, once
again, resembles the structure of mutual implication that characterizes
the relation between the typicality of literary object-types and the
particularity of the complex scenarios in which the literary work
inserts them. (139)</p></blockquote>
<p>
The reason that our interest in literature takes the historical form
Knapp calls “literary interest” is that the encounter with literature
replicates the dynamics of human agency.&nbsp; We relate to the text in the
same manner we relate to our <em>selves</em>. 
Since literature isn’t valuable so much as interesting, the only
defense available to Knapp would be to tie its value to its interest. 
(If gardening could be proven to entail the same interesting relation
to human agency, this argument suggests, then gardening would be as
valuable as literature.) His defense of the literary amounts then to a
defense of all engagements <em>like the literary</em>, in which the
oscillation between type and particularity mirror (or poorly parrot)
the oscillation endemic to the experience of human agency.&nbsp; Stephen
King’s latest tome may be unliterary because its characters are too
typical, never approaching the particular, never starting the swinging
characteristic of literature.&nbsp; <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, however, easily qualifies as literary.&nbsp; (Not a <em>bad</em> thing, mind you, only a conventionally <em>unliterary</em>
one.) I (admittedly) fudge Knapp’s argument here, attributing to the
object the experience it excites in the reader (or viewer), but I fudge
because I believe I can: </p>
<p>
Knapp’s argument demands that the reader have a knowledge of types. 
How else would a reader know whether what they encounter in Situation A
is a particular instantiation of a more general type?&nbsp; Were one to
compile a complete catalog of types, distinguishing works which inspire
literary interest from ones which don’t becomes a simple matter of
correspondence.&nbsp; Then the Canon--or, more precisely, <em>some</em>
canon--slips in the back door.&nbsp; Given the works of literature whose
engagement served as the foundation of his argument, this canon would
largely resemble the Canon, only with the addition of the <a href="http://cfp.english.upenn.edu/archive/2005-07/0025.html">Whedonverse</a>.&nbsp; (I must admit that I fancy this notion both generally and to the degree it would depoliticize the continuing <a href="http://vos.ucsb.edu/browse.asp?id=680">Canon Wars</a>.)&nbsp; All of which brings me to this:
</p>
<p>
<em>What does this mean for people who interpret literature for a living?</em>
</p>
<p>
I won’t answer yet because I don’t feel I can answer yet.&nbsp; Suggestions will be welcomed and appreciated.

But one sign out-signifies all the rest. I speak, of course, of having a favorite index. You know you do. There's that one index out there that you read like a novel and cherish like a dead parent. Don't deny it. So today I step out onto this ledge of a limb and introduce you to my favorite index: The &quot;Index of Topics&quot; in Kenneth Burke's The Philosophy of Literary Form. If you want to know where Burke discusses &quot;Accepting (by one name), Rejecting (by another),&quot; all you need do is consult the index. If you were more interested in &quot;'Beauty,' via tonal disguise of the repellent,&quot; &quot;Catharsis by 'electoral obscenity,'&quot; or &quot;Destruction (of natural resources) poetically interpreted as 'advance,'&quot; consult the index. If you want to anticipate John Guillory's argument in Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Creation by a robust 57 years, consult the index then read about &quot;Education, as working capital of Intelligensia.&quot; The depressed can take comfort in his account of the &quot;Emptiness (of failure, of success),&quot; &quot;Expectancy, the 'arrows' of,&quot; &quot;'Medicine,' Hitler's&quot; or &quot;Humanitarianism, and Debunking.&quot; The aesthete can bask in the &quot;'Aesthetic Sense,' Special&quot; or ponder the conflict of &quot;Aesthetic, vs. Anesthetic.&quot; The blunt can read of &quot;Frankness, not 'distinterested curiosity'&quot; and complain of it with &quot;'Four-letter Words,' transformed.&quot; The socialist can learn where to find &quot;Laughter, 'Capitalist,'&quot; but lest he dive into his doldrums, he can also discover the &quot;Mythic Hero, recipe for&quot; and the &quot;Magic Formulae, 'outraged'&quot; required to cook Him or Her up. (Then he can discover arguments about &quot;'Prolitarian Literature as 'Pastoral'&quot; and put his outraged Magic Formulae to good use.) The overconfident can undermine their own arguments by reading &quot;Opponent, Unanswerable,&quot; &quot;Perspectives, Theory of (to transcend rival perspectives.&quot; The strict formalist can try (and fail) to verify his intuitions by turning to Burke's discussion of the &quot;Poem, not identical for writer and reader,&quot; but if his delusions get the best of him, he can &quot;succeed&quot; by &quot;Summarizing Term, as 'god-function.'&quot; Freudians can avoid the ubiquitous &quot;Unanswerable Opponent&quot; by asserting that the &quot;Universe, becomes 'guilt-laden'&quot; and denying that the &quot;Symbolic Act, in neurosis as distinct from art.&quot; (If that fails, they can commit &quot;Symbolic Suicide, as assertion.&quot;) [Note: The rest of the index is available below the fold.] Page 6: Page 7: Page 8:</span></a></div>
