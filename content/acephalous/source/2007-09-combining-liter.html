		<span id="comment-82000743-content"><p>Ah, <i>Robotech</i>.  Did you know that Minmay&#39;s song is actually bearable in the Japanese-language version?  </p>

<p>But somehow, even as a youth (or however old I was, cough), I could tell that this was a pastiche, and it became for me the ur-Postmodern text.  Later on, reading <i>Gravity&#39;s Rainbow</i>, I&#39;d be thinking &quot;Wait, this isn&#39;t trashy enough.  Where is the moronic pop culture?  The incoherence?  The mixed-up genres?&quot;</p>

<p>Which may be one of the reasons why I think that <a href="http://imago.hitherby.com/" rel="nofollow">Hitherby Dragons</a> is, seriously, a work of postmodern genius.  There, in <a href="http://imago.hitherby.com/archives/000093.php" rel="nofollow">Rainbow Noir</a>,  &quot;the padlock of alienation, the lipstick of transgression, the hourglass of fatalism, and the broken heart of the femme fatale&quot; spring from the magical symbols of bears, but Nihilism Bear is not defeated, and <a href="http://imago.hitherby.com/?p=553" rel="nofollow">My Little Wolves</a> eat each other when they are hurt.  Seriously, I have no idea why this hasn&#39;t been hailed as a masterpiece and Rebecca convinced to finish it somehow.  Aren&#39;t you literary critic types supposed to be good for something?</p></span>

<p>I will note that I am convinced Salman Rushdie tipped his hat to Douglas Adams in <i>Satanic Verses</i> with the falling-from-the-sky internal monologue early on that reminds me at least of that guy Arthur Dent was always accidentally killing&#39;s one as a whale falling to his death....</p></span>

But that doesn&#39;t match the existential brilliance of _The Sun Also Rises As I Lay Dying,_ in which Darl, the tragically wounded and impotent soldier returning from WWI is kept apart from Lady Brett because he has to help his family cart the decaying dead body of his mother to the great running of the bulls.

<p>I especially like how after getting sucker punched by Robert Cohn, Jake &quot;sat down on the pavement.&quot; I&#39;m sure Hemingway wanted to end that marvelous sentence with &#39;gracefully&#39; but it was a silly adverb, and silly adverbs are for weaklings. </p>

<p>Did you know Hollywood is considering a Robotech film adaptation? I know that&#39;ll awaken everyone&#39;s childhood dreams of magic movie wonder.</p></span>

<p>Robotech actually more or less made sense if you watched the episodes in their correct order, which of course the end-of-dial UHF stations that broadcast it in the 80s couldn&#39;t be bothered to do.  They did do some slight violence to the storylines of all three series to merge them into a single universe, but mostly to &quot;Southern Cross&quot; -- Macross was translated more-or-less accurately, and Mospeada had only cosmetic alterations.  But the three series were supposed to be aired end-to-end, not intermingled.</p></span>

My dissertation was birthed by a single sentence from Stephen Jay Gould's The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002): As the Darwinian centennial of 1909 neared, [Vernon] Kellogg decided to write a volume providing a fair hearing for all varieties of Darwinism, and all alternative views in a decade of maximal agnosticism and diversity in evolutionary theories. (163) That sentence stuck with me. When I started reading literary criticism on the period, I noticed that much of it assumed Darwinian theory had been applied globally. So I went to the library, checked out Kellogg's book, Darwinism Today (1907), and here I am ... the proud owner of a dissertation with the word &quot;diversity&quot; in the title. I'm shocked I haven't been hired already.</span></a></div>

VT quarterback Sean Glennon is having problems concentrating in the huddle ... not because of the 90,000 rabid LSU fans screaming at him, and not because he's facing the best defense in the nation, but because he can never rid himself of the memories of that tragic day. He prays to God someday he will, but that day is not today, as he looks completely out-thought and over-matched by this LSU defense. Meanwhile, God—paying very close attention to this game—has decided that the 1,800 people killed by his hurricane need mourning far more than the mere thirty-two people Seung-Hui Cho murdered before taking his own life. Of course, it's only the end of the first quarter, and He may change His mind. UPDATE: The Lord can count, apparently, and He feels worse about Katrina. LSU up twenty-four to nothing. Geaux Tigers. UPDATE II: Three LSU linemen weighing a collective 900 lbs. stitched the Virginia Tech players a memorial quilt. We all know how God feels about blankets. Geaux Tigers. *Lest the hate-mail stream in: I'm not mocking anyone except the announcers here. They've obviously been told to be &quot;reverent&quot; and are trying their best ... but their best entails turning a football game into a theological disquisition on the God's will delivered with all the complexity of freshmen who've hit more bongs than books.</span></a></div>
