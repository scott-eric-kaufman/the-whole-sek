		<span id="comment-15522761-content"><p>This is just an idea I&#39;ve been tossing around.</p>

<p>If we refused to accept explanations that refer to some kind of unconscious then Nietzsche, Freud and    ( in my ill informed opinion) perhaps even Marx would take a severe battering. In fact if there is no unconscious Theory takes an enormous hit because Theory explanations often work by attributing motives to persons who were certainly not aware of them in a way that wouldn&#39;t be plausible without an unconscious. Hence your rejection of the unconscious has implications that make the rejection of Freud look tame in comparision. I&#39;m not judging your rejection either way, just pointing out what I think are it&#39;s implications. </p></span>

Proof positive that the Internet works. That should silence all you doubters. This snark-inspired conversation only improves with age . . . even if it is the source of the &quot;Scott's not funny&quot; meme responsible for torpedoing my Koufax campaign. Ken's post deserves 1) more attention and 2) a response. Now that I'm finished with this quarter and have a whopping four days off I intend on writing one. It's not like I didn't already like Michael. Only now I like him that much more. If only there were some way I could take advantage of his celebrity . . .</span></a></div>

He breathes nuance into the word fug—Hey! Did you see that? I swear I saw him crack a smile. Look at him now! You can tell he wants to laugh. Why's he suppressing a smile? And—Wait! What's he looking at now? What's he spy over your right shoulder? Breathe deep and whatever you do don't turn around. Your ol' pal Nic' is winding you up is all. There's nothing there. Maybe you shouldn't have called him ugly. That was really uncalled for. Don't try to pin this on me! You earned your fate my friend. He didn't want this to happen to you. He thought you liked him. Thought the two of you could hang out and discover important stuff together. But you blew it. Talking about him behind his back. You should know better. Doesn't matter now though. Nothing you can do. Now you're the one with the behind-his-back problems. Ironic isn't it?</span></a></div>
