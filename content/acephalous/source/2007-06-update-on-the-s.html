<p>&quot;John Casper&quot; still refuses to answer any questions I have about his
identity.&nbsp; All I know is that I am being harassed by someone named
&quot;John Casper.&quot;&nbsp; My attempts to discover his identity have been limited
to determining whether he is the same &quot;John Casper&quot; who posts on
FireDogLake.&nbsp; I have made these attempts because, should it come to
that, I do not want to accuse the wrong person of harassment.&nbsp; What do
I mean by harassment?&nbsp; Since he sent the first email to the UCI
community, he has sent <em>five</em> more.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The second concerned my apparent disregard for UCI disciplinary
policy, and included material from a private email I had sent &quot;General
JC Christian, Patriot,&quot; which the General shared with &quot;John Casper.&quot;&nbsp; I
wrote:</p><blockquote><p>He's decided to contact my employer because of
some civil debate on the Gilbert thread.&nbsp; I'm not likely to get in
trouble for this, but it will annoy people (myself included), through
the creation of unnecessary meetings/conference calls/&amp;c.&nbsp; As he's
your commenter, his actions will reflect on you, so I thought I'd give
you the heads up.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>To &quot;John Casper,&quot; the act of wanting to
avoid entangling my university in an online disagreement constitutes my
&quot;assessment of UCI's disciplinary policy.&quot;&nbsp; When I informed him that I
had written this:</p><blockquote><p>Although it will cause me personal inconvenience, I do hope the people
who received this email take it seriously.&nbsp; Accusations of hate-speech
and race-based discrimination should be investigated, so that when the
complaints are <em>legitimate </em>they can be dealt with accordingly.</p></blockquote><p>He then forward <em>that </em>to
half the UCI community.&nbsp; By this point, I had sent him three emails. 
 He has responded to none.&nbsp; Now he believes I have committed a crime
against him.&nbsp; He learned of my desire to discover his identity from the
General.&nbsp; Here is my email (to which the General never responded):</p>

<blockquote><p>Would it be possible 
to get the IP information for the Ghost of Adolph Rupp? He's stepped up his 
behavior and is now bordering on harassment. I have his name, but I need to know 
which &quot;John Casper&quot; he is.</p></blockquote>
<p>When &quot;John Casper&quot; asked whether the General would share that information, the General responded:</p><blockquote><p>not going to do it. stay off the comments for awhile so 
i can say there's no way to find your ip.</p></blockquote><p>I'm considering revoking my opinion of the General.&nbsp; I no longer think he's a classy guy.&nbsp; So at this point I <em>still </em>do not know the identity of the man who is threatening my career.&nbsp; Moreover, he is conspiring with others to <em>hide </em>his
identity from me.&nbsp; You can read the complete text of his letter below
the fold.&nbsp; As to why I am publishing this information, the first reason
is because I have absolutely nothing to hide.&nbsp; The second is that he is
copying his emails to news outlets, and in so doing indicates that he
wants people to read them.&nbsp; (He includes the General's email in an
attachment, and I assume &quot;John Casper&quot; sought the General's permission
to do so.&nbsp; If he did not, I will remove the General's words from this
site.)</p>

<p>What does &quot;John Casper&quot; want?&nbsp; According to the first email, he wants me &quot;<span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">to make 
<strong>substantial restitution </strong>to people who have been injured by the 
kind of of refined white supremacist language that he wants posted on an 
<strong>ABC affiliate</strong>.&quot;&nbsp; (That I do not, in fact, want such language
posted on an ABC affiliate is apparently immaterial.)&nbsp; According to his
latest letter, he thinks that my requests to discover his identity are
&quot;compelling evidence of a crime&quot; which he believes &quot;grounds for
discipline up to and including termination.&quot;&nbsp; I'm not sure how my
knowing the identity of my harasser is a crime, maybe you can enlighten
me? </span></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">Any way you cut it, it
seems like a large portion of the liberal blogosphere is conspiring to
get me fired.&nbsp; As a liberal, I find this all quite baffling.&nbsp; And
distressing.&nbsp; Every time an email message arrives, I feel physically
ill.&nbsp; Will it be <em>another </em>email to my superiors from an anonymous person demanding I be fired?&nbsp; </span><br /><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">The forwarded email below 
confirms that Mr. Kaufman just emailed this to patriot boy: </span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><em>&quot;Would it be possible 
to get the IP information for the Ghost of Adolph Rupp? He's stepped up his 
behavior and is now bordering on harassment. I have his name, but I need to know 
which &quot;John Casper&quot; he is.&quot;</em></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">I am pretty sure that Mr. 
Kaufman’s request of patriotboy is excellent evidence of a crime. My guess is 
that it’s grounds for discipline up to and including termination. </span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">Dr. Quanbech, Mr. Kaufman 
has received <strong>no emails</strong> from me that have <strong>not</strong> been copied to you, 
Congressman Waters and the NAACP. </span></p>
<p>Since Mr. Kaufman 
has accused me of &quot;<em>behavior</em>&quot; that <em>&quot;borders on harassment,&quot;</em> I 
have no choice but to forward you his second email. This is it in its 
<strong>entirety</strong>: </p>
<p><em>“Never heard back 
from you, just wanted to make sure you got the General's email.&nbsp; </em>[The
email in question is the one the General sent to me, in which he claims
to have sent &quot;John Casper&quot; a note encouraging him not to contact UCI. 
Given that &quot;John Casper&quot; never received that note, I can only assume it
was never sent.]&nbsp; <em>Hope it 
clarified the matter. You may be hearing again from me soon, just so you 
know.”</em></p>
<p>I will also forward 
you Mr. Kaufman’s third email. This is it in its <strong>entirety</strong>: 
</p>
<p><em>“I am still 
waiting to hear back from you. If I don't hear from you soon, you'll certainly 
be contacted again in the near future. Just so you know.”</em></p>
<p>These both completely 
contradict the calumny that Mr. Kaufman so casually wrote to 
patriotboy.<em>&nbsp;</em>[<em>They in no way contradict what I wrote &quot;patriotboy.&quot;&nbsp; They indicate that I am considering my legal options.</em>]</p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">After, receiving Mr. 
Kaufman’s third email, I forwarded his <strong>first </strong>email to everyone under the 
subject line<strong>: <em>“</em></strong><em>Mr. Kaufman's assessment of UCI disciplinary 
processes.” </em></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">As everyone already 
knows,&nbsp; Mr. Kaufman then emailed me:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><em>“You really are an 
amoral liar, aren't you? Why not send this instead: […]”&nbsp; </em>[<em>The information he so carefully redacted is my statement that I hope UCI takes all allegations of hateful language seriously.</em>] </span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">As the time stamps confirm, 
after I followed Mr. Kaufman's suggestion, he then became very interested in my 
IP address and &quot;<em>which John Casper,&quot;</em>&nbsp; I am.&nbsp; [<em>Because
he has now sent five emails to random members of the UCI community

supremacist or that I support the dissemination of white supremacist
speech.&nbsp; I believe I am being harassed, and would like to know the
identity of the person harassing me.</em>]<br /> </span></p>
<p>I have <strong>a lot 
</strong>of <strong>very serious</strong> questions for Mr. Kaufman. The 
first question is, where’s the evidence?<em>&nbsp;</em>I would ask that someone you 
designate, Dr. Quanbech, email me about how best to obtain answers from Mr. 
Kaufman. I'll be happy to submit them in writing if that 
helps. [<em>Perhaps he can try answering any of the emails he quotes in this very letter.</em>]<br /> </p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif">Careful readers I am sure 
have already noticed that Mr. Kaufman’s first emails to patriotboy and me 
contained his English Department <strong>signature </strong>from the University 
of California at Irvine. Mr. Kaufman deleted that signature in his last emails 
to patriotboy and me. [<em>I
did not delete the signatures.&nbsp; I sent those emails through Gmail on my
wife's computer, and I only have my signature set up in Outlook.</em>]<br /> </span></p></blockquote>

		<span id="comment-72302752-content"><p>I also ran across the &quot;John Casper&quot; / &quot;Ghost of Adolph Rupp&quot; connection, googling the same comments that Anonymous turned up.  That gives essentially no new hard information.  The guy could simply have a second pseudonym that sounds more like a real name -- both have a ghost theme -- or it could be a real name.  There&#39;s a John Casper who&#39;s a sportswriter, so if it&#39;s a pseudonym it could be a sports fan.</p>

<p>In any case, a fairly common name plus a hotmail Email address, with no other contact information, is a reasonably good pseudonym even if it&#39;s a real name.  </p>

<p>This also doesn&#39;t really answer the question of what kind of person it is.  Their behavior puts you on a predictable collision course with JD and FDL.  That could be more of the same weird acting-out that is there on the surface, or it could be provocation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry that this is going on, Scott.  I&#39;m not sure what to advise.  If it&#39;s a disturbed and dysfunctional person, you have nothing to gain from it, not even that they&#39;ll leave you alone.  You&#39;re actually better off if it&#39;s a cruel person who is still functional enough to have something to lose.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-72305862-content"><p>I guess that my best advice (given via comment box, not Email, because I don&#39;t want to contribute to making you ill) depends on what your greatest need is at this time.  If you decide that this is serious / legal, then probably the first thing I&#39;d guess that your lawyer is going to tell you is to stop making public statements about it -- including publishing Emails, characterizing what he&#39;s doing, etc.  (Note: I am not a lawyer of any kind.)  If you decide that it is not serious to the point of involving the legal system, then you have to decide what your purpose is.  It may not actually help, directly, to find out who &quot;John Casper&quot; is, for most of the nonlegal goals that I can imagine.  If the guy is a stalker, then continuing to post about it provides needed feedback -- I note that his new Emails seem to start with your new posts.  There&#39;s always the chance that if you don&#39;t mention it, he&#39;ll get bored and do something else.  On the other hand, not posting about it means that you don&#39;t get expressions of sympathy, which can be very cheering to someone caught in this kind of thing.</p>

<p>Sorry that I don&#39;t have anything better to offer.</p></span>

<p>I could continue, but you see my point.  Was <em>he</em> commenting on blogs on company time?  (For the record, I wasn&#39;t.  I work at home, and am currently on leave.)  Would he like to have <em>his</em> superiors alerted as to what he does on their time?  </p>

Granted, he sent me an email saying that if I contacted again he would consider it harassment.  This in response to a polite, civil request for information about &quot;John Casper.&quot;  He also forwarded the message to &quot;abuse@gmail.com,&quot; because <em>I</em> am the one abusing matters here.  </p>

<p>I hate to say it, but this says a lot about the General, none of it good.  If I had more clout, I&#39;d say we press him to explain why he&#39;s protecting someone clearly harassing a fellow liberal, but I doubt it would do much good.  After all, despite the parody, he seems to believe that no man -- no matter how despicable his lies -- should be &quot;left behind.&quot;  </p></span>

<p>I think Rich P. is giving you excellent advice. </p>

<p>I have real concerns about anyone giving IP information to anyone. If the need arises a subpena  is the only reasonable course and then the data should only be given to law enforcement authorities investigating what they consider a valid complaint.  However nothing would prevent you from posting the long header to one the offending emails here. Then a lot of folks with decoding knowledge could confirm your work.</p>

<p>I suspect that you have far moe support in the liberal blogging community than you think have in regard to this matter, even on JG. I do know that a bunch of truly odd messages appeared over there recently and have caused the shutdown of the commenting system there.</p></span>

This really does feel like a good old fashioned DHo stomping party. Except these guys are the good guys, right? Someone dares to argue with you, and you notify the media, deploying all the right keywords and talking points. Combine a slow news day in Southern California and the words &quot;white supremacist academic,&quot; and we&#39;ll go quickly from the news at 11 to SEK&#39;s career dangling from the flagpole. </p>

<p>And the more we see, the less it looks like the fact that this is simply the work of a single deranged individual. Notice the way the same language echoes from Casper to JG himself...</p>

<p>This is insane, and really one of the darker moments I&#39;ve seen in my blog time. Worse even than Bitch&#39;s - at least that guy was &quot;on the other side.&quot; This is even more frightening...</p></span>

Well, that&#39;s cause for celebration, if its true.  As sickening as the first wave of nonsense was, it was understandable.  What&#39;s happened since has been purely nauseating, beginning with his self-defense and lauding of Brittney&#39;s apology, and the refusal to call the attack morons off here.<br />
Disgusting.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-72338530-content"><p>Having watched all this unfold from the comfort of my Nashville home (I connect via my employer&#39;s firewall, so disregard the IP address info and oops, it&#39;s now 8:01am), I have to say that at first, I thought it was all a joke. There&#39;s a lot of contention between those of us who are liberals and those who are not here in Nashville, so it was par for the course. But when the whole situation blew up, I was taken by complete surprise. I&#39;m still not certain how it all happened.</p>

<p>But now that I read stories like this (and some others), I&#39;m starting to wonder if &quot;liberals&quot; are really this nasty or if, perhaps there&#39;s some right-wing conspiracy to create a divide in our little online community. Call me crazy, but those right-wingnuts are some crafty people. Is John Casper a plant? I think it&#39;s a possibility. As for patriotboy, that&#39;s just sad.</p></span>

Not about me, but I nearly choked when I saw it go over the departmental listserv. The money quote: &quot;A lot of the blogs distort facts and take things out of context,&quot; said Alex Chazen, president of Hillel. Just like Jews, isn't it, to look out for their own. Wait, is that anti-Semitic? Can I even be anti-Semitic?</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/generals_gone_r.html"><span><strong>Generals Gone Rethuglican; or, Shattered Faith &amp; Pressing Deadlines</strong> UPDATE #4 The General has requested that I not contact him through email again. You read the email I sent him below, so it must be obvious to you why he reported my address to abuse@gmail.com. Clearly, he is the one being abused. He is the one whose career is being threatened by the actions of one of his commenters ... wait, that's me. I will honor his request—and would have, even if I had not independently discovered the IP address of the man stalking me—and would inform him of such, but doing so would constitute harassment. The strange thing is, by virtue of being harassed by one of his commenters, I have been summarily banned from commenting on Jesus' General. I think this speaks volumes about the General's priorities, but I don't want to speculate. Maybe he is not trying to defend the person whose identity he conspired to hide from me. Two days ago, I would have given him the benefit of the doubt. Today? Not so much. My fear is that they will begin slandering me over there again, and I will have no recourse to respond. (I will not stoop to using proxies. What I write online I write under my own name. This is a matter of principle.) If my fellow liberals should choose to slander me again, I would not be upset if one of you voiced your dissent. On another note, in the comments I see two trends emerging. The first is that I'm experiencing my first taste of how liberals behave. I don't buy it. Many of the General's commenters have expressed their outrage both in the comments and via email. I do not believe the actions of &quot;John Casper&quot; or the General reflect upon liberals at large. A certain type of liberal whose life plays out online, maybe, but these clowns do not represent the left. The second trend is that I should remove the gloves, pick up a roll of quarters and give as good as I'm getting. I can't stomach that. I'm not some common internet thug. I know who &quot;John Casper&quot; is. I know where he works. I even know his home phone number. I may be a brawler, but I am no tattler. I will not tell his employers what he does on company time. I will not stoop to his level. I believe in the medium, no matter how much &quot;John Casper&quot; and the General shake my faith. The irony in all this is that I need to put the finishing touches on an article espousing the virtues of blogging sometime tomorrow. You may be surprised to learn that I'm not as sanguine on the idea of online communication as I once was. I hope that this all passes over, and that my optimism returns shortly, so that my praise for the possibility of online criticism might not ring hollow ... but who knows. Maybe tomorrow I'll toss my hands in the air and declare that...</span></a></div>
