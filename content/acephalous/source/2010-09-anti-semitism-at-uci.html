        <meta name="description" content="A commenter emailed and requested I write something about Kenneth Marcus's article on anti-Semitism at UCI. It opens: During the first years of the 21st century, the virus of anti-Semitism was unleashed with a vengeance in Irvine, California. There, on the campus of the University of California at Irvine, Jewish students were physically and verbally harassed, threatened, shoved, stalked, and targeted by rock-throwing groups and individuals. Jewish property was defaced with swastikas, and a Holocaust memorial was vandalized. Signs were posted on campus showing a Star of David dripping with blood. Jews were chastised for arrogance by public speakers whose appearance at the institution was subsidized by the university. They were called “dirty Jew” and “fucking Jew,” told to “go back to Russia” and “burn in hell,” and heard other students and visitors to the campus urge one another to “slaughter the Jews.” One Jewish student who wore a pin bearing the flags of the United States and Israel was told to “take off that pin or we’ll beat your ass.” Another was told, “Jewish students are the plague of mankind” and “Jews should be finished off in the ovens.” As someone who lived and worked on campus during &quot;the first years of the 21st century,&quot; I find it strange that I don't remember being &quot;physically and verbally harassed, threatened, shoved, stalked, [or] targeted by rock-throwing groups.&quot; I must have taken a blow to the head—that, or the &quot;virus of anti-Semitism [that] was unleashed with a vengeance&quot; wasn't quite as virulent or vengeful as Marcus claims. Admittedly, I'm generally of the opinion that Orange County Jews aren't good for the Jews, but I'm particularly irked by Hillel and Anteaters for Israel for the simple reason that they're the Rex Kramer of student organizations: That's not to say the Muslim Student Union owns the moral high ground, as all involved have been hurling chum at each other for as long as I've been at Irvine. The key words here are &quot;all involved,&quot; because contrary to Marcus's article, &quot;all involved&quot; refers not to &quot;Jewish students,&quot; but vocal members of Hillel and Anteaters for Israel who either deliberately provoke or are deliberately provoked by members of the Muslim Student Union. Of course, Marcus declines to state that the obverse is also true: &quot;all involved&quot; refers not to &quot;Muslim students,&quot; but vocal members of the Muslim Student Union who either deliberately provoke or are deliberately provoked by members of Hillel and Anteaters for Israel. The university does not &quot;foster a hostile environment for Jewish students,&quot; but it does allow Jewish students to stand in front of the library and create a hostile environment all on their lonesome. For example, when I sported a beard last winter, a member of Hillel in the middle of an argument with a Muslim student pointed at me and asked if I supported the &quot;racist statement&quot; my &quot;Muslim brother&quot; had made.

			<p>A commenter emailed and requested I write something about Kenneth Marcus&#39;s <a href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/a-blind-eye-to-campus-anti-semitism--15510?page=all">article on anti-Semitism at UCI</a>.  It opens:</p>
<blockquote>During the first years of the 21st century, the virus of anti-Semitism was unleashed with a vengeance in Irvine, California. There, on the campus of the University of California at Irvine, Jewish students were physically and verbally harassed, threatened, shoved, stalked, and targeted by rock-throwing groups and individuals. Jewish property was defaced with swastikas, and a Holocaust memorial was vandalized. Signs were posted on campus showing a Star of David dripping with blood. Jews were chastised for arrogance by public speakers whose appearance at the institution was subsidized by the university. They were called “dirty Jew” and “fucking Jew,” told to “go back to Russia” and “burn in hell,” and heard other students and visitors to the campus urge one another to “slaughter the Jews.” One Jewish student who wore a pin bearing the flags of the United States and Israel was told to “take off that pin or we’ll beat your ass.” Another was told, “Jewish students are the plague of mankind” and “Jews should be finished off in the ovens.”</blockquote>
<p>As someone who lived and worked on campus during &quot;the first years of the 21st century,&quot; I find it strange that I don&#39;t remember being &quot;physically and verbally harassed, threatened, shoved, stalked, [or] targeted by rock-throwing groups.&quot;  I must have taken a blow to the head—that, or the &quot;virus of anti-Semitism [that] was unleashed with a vengeance&quot; wasn&#39;t quite as virulent or vengeful as Marcus claims.  Admittedly, I&#39;m generally of the <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/01/time-to-mock-el.html">opinion that Orange County Jews aren&#39;t good for the Jews</a>, but I&#39;m particularly irked by <a href="not"></a><a href="http://www.ochillel.org/">Hillel</a> and <a href="http://www.afiuci.org/">Anteaters for Israel</a> for the simple reason that they&#39;re the Rex Kramer of student organizations:</p>

</object>
</p>
<p>That&#39;s not to say the <a href="http://www.msu-uci.com/">Muslim Student Union</a> owns the moral high ground, as all involved have been hurling chum at each other for as long as I&#39;ve been at Irvine.  The key words here are &quot;all involved,&quot; because contrary to Marcus&#39;s article, &quot;all involved&quot; refers not to &quot;Jewish students,&quot; but vocal members of Hillel and Anteaters for Israel who either deliberately provoke or are deliberately provoked by members of the Muslim Student Union.  Of course, Marcus declines to state that the obverse is also true: &quot;all involved&quot; refers not to &quot;Muslim students,&quot; but vocal members of the Muslim Student Union who either deliberately provoke or are deliberately provoked by members of Hillel and Anteaters for Israel.  The university does not &quot;foster a hostile environment for Jewish students,&quot; but it does allow Jewish students to stand in front of the library and create a hostile environment all on their lonesome.</p>
<p>For example, when I sported a beard last winter, a member of Hillel in the middle of an argument with a Muslim student pointed at me and asked if I supported the &quot;racist statement&quot; my &quot;Muslim brother&quot; had made.  As I had no idea what my &quot;Muslim brother&quot; had said—my deafness when walking on campus is <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/two_posts_writt.html">the stuff of legend</a>—I politely informed her that I was Jewish, which prompted her to swing a finger at the Muslim student and demand I partake of her outrage.  The Muslim student looked unfazed, which is when it dawned on me that these two had probably been doing this dance all day, all quarter, all academic year. The same &quot;student mentors&quot; bring the same Holocaust and counter-Holocaust walls to campus every year, meaning these professional provocateurs have to <em>coordinate </em>their plans to foment discord among an otherwise apathetic student body. I imagine it starts something like this:</p>
<blockquote><strong>ABBAS: </strong>I want to hate the last week of November. &#0160;Are you free then?</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>FYVUSH: </strong>Let me check calendar. (<em>leans back in his chair</em>) ESTHER! ESTHER! CAN WE MAKE TO HATE IN NOVEMBER?</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>ESTHER: </strong>(<em>offstage left</em>) NOVEMBER WHEN!</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>FYVUSH: </strong>ABBAS PREFERS THE LAST WEEK!</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>ESTHER: </strong>TELL ABBAS I SAY HELLO!</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>FYVUSH: </strong>ESTHER SAYS HELLO!</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>ESTHER: </strong>DID YOU TELL HIM I SAID HELLO!</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>FYVUSH: </strong>I DID!</blockquote>
<p>Something like that.</p>

<p>Quite. Not sure what to do about it. As an ethnic Muslim / religious atheist, I still identify with the Palestinian cause, and wouldn&#39;t want the issue to disappear completely from campuses. I just don&#39;t want to be forced to make a choice between supporting the Gaza blockade in the name of Israeli security (or becoming an anti-Semite), and supporting Hamas in the name of anti-colonialism (or becoming an Islamophobe). But, that&#39;s the options I&#39;m given.*</p>

<p>Still, I blame the political parties (or factions therein) for using I/P as a polarising wedge issue more than I blame the extremists on either side for this sorry situation.</p>

<p>* Guess that makes me an Islamophobic anti-Semite. Which would mean I&#39;m a liberal fascist...</p></span>

<p>As an agnostic liberal Jew, I still identify with the Palestinian cause, as well as <i>some</i> Israeli security concerns, and I wouldn&#39;t want either issue to disappear from our attention until they are no longer problems.

A couple of months ago, I was on the campus of the school where I&#39;d done my undergrad.  I briefly walked through the &quot;free speech area&quot; and all of the same groups were there just the same as eight years ago, the same informational handouts, the same signs, the same shouting.  It actually made me profoundly nostalgic.  (Actually, it wasn&#39;t entirely the same.  I think that the Muslim Student Association wasn&#39;t so excised about Chechnya anymore).</p></span>

I was driving into our development the morning after  the Jewish New Year service and on the NEW welcome signs were symbols of Nazi hate toward Jews. So, in an upper-middle-class area hate can still be found.  Whatever they used to paint the symbols has now taken several days to remove and some of the brick work will need to be replaced.  The police and Homeowners Association had houndreds of messages from people upset(including mine) and I am not Jewish as you well know.  It can be everywhere and it needs to be addressed and solved.  I hope your generation is the one to make the changes needed. </p></span>

I’m with Slagle on the condemnation, though I’m not as surprised as he seems to be that Morrissey would say or write something controversial. It’s not like he’s written a song from the perspective of a young man flirting with organized racism or another in which he imagined putting Thatcher to the guillotine or anything. In short, color me unsurprised that Morrissey’s courting controversy as a means of bringing attention to a cause—the unethical treatment of animals in China—he’s only supported since he was eleven. Is his remark vile? Of course it is. That’s not the point. The point is that Slagle, is a terrible writer, and also that, his particular form of cultural illiteracy is, a sign of things to come. I’m not bagging on the man because he clearly knows nothing about Morrissey, or because he thinks being a woman is an insult (“his current diet … is obviously too high in soy-estrogen”), or even because of his aforementioned problem with, the written word. His brand of cultural ignorance bothers me because Wikipedia exists. Claiming that a band that broke up in 1987 “put out several gloomy pop albums in the late eighties and early nineties” is not only factually incorrect, it suggests a mind as incurious as it is lazy and ignorant. Simply put, cultural critics should know something about the culture they criticize, as well as a little something about the ones they find it politically convenient to defend. For example: Buddhism did not originate in China and is not a “cult.” That Slagle defends the Chinese against Morrissey’s racist remarks with a demonstration of his ignorance about all things Chinese would be amusing were “the reverse tu quoque” a little less common. As you know, the classic tu quoque works like this: Person X: It should be illegal to put babies on spikes. Person Y: But I just saw you put a baby on a spike! In this example, Person Y tries to undermine the argument of Person X by calling him a hypocrite. This is, obviously, a fallacy. But in a world in which people stand by SASQUATCH ISRAEL, the only way to improve a fallacious argument is, it seems, to double down on it. The reverse tu quoque, then, goes something like this: Person X: It should be illegal to put babies on spikes. Person Y: (putting a baby on a spike) But I just saw you put a baby on a spike! In this example, Person Y tries to undermine the argument of Person X by calling him a hypocrite while doing the very thing he claims to want undermined. Because it requires a demonstrable act of self-refutation, the reverse tu quoque should only be attempted by the brave, and even then only when speaking to the stupid. Because the rest of us? We see through it. Not that that will stop people...</span></a></div>
