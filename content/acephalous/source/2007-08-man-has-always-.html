I&#39;ve been looking at the alternative venues for scholarly publication -- trying to find the bottom of the bottom of the barrel -- and came across it earlier.  I&#39;m not speaking to the quality of the publication so much as its means of publication.  Granted, I don&#39;t think much of that particular publication, but it&#39;s not bat-shit insane, merely formulaic.  Sadly, there&#39;s something to be said for that.</p></span>

The article and the work it describes dutifully scream the strained lyric required of all academic appropriations of popular culture: SCIENCE FICTION MAY BE SCIENCE FACT! Don't get me wrong. In all probability, we do exist only in the damp basement of some posthuman slob's parent's housicle, orbiting a dilapidated artificial planetoid in a once posh sector of subspace.* And in all probability, the housicle dangles from an asteroid which only exists on the backup server of a quantum computer floating in the depths of a gas giant orbiting a dying sun, under the care of a shiftless cloud of sentient ambiplasma.** This is a given. Much more interesting are the comments of Jonathon Von Post, which appear on all the blogs which link to the Tierney. Von Post complains that the article's subject, Nick Bostrom, fails to note that he, Von Post, beat him, Bostrom, to the we-are-simulated-by-positron-electron-entities a-googol-years-in-the-future punch. I'm not able to evalute his claim, since the article in question, &quot;&quot;Human Destiny and the End of Time,&quot; published in Quantum Science Fiction in 1991, isn't available online. But Von Post's crusade for acknowledgment, however superficially narcissistic it may seem, is a compelling reminder of a couple of things: In academia, precedence matters. There's no official means of establishing it. Given that this is the case, I'm led to these thoughts: If Quantum Science Fiction was online and linkable, Von Post's claims could easily be verified. If all scholarship was available online, our judgments wouldn't be influenced by who turned out to be the better popularizer. I admit that Von Post sounds like a crank and behaves like a troll. Still, there's a chance his embitterment is justified, that he was steamrolled by a duplicitous colleague or ignored by an unethical careerist. A freely available, easily searchable scholarly database could put such issues to rest. If establishing precedence were but a Google Toolbar away, how much festering animus could be lanced clean? I don't know, but I'd love to. *When s/he thinks about us on hir thog, hir co-thogger rolls eleven eyes and wonders, not for the first time, whether he should do hir a favor and unplug us already: &quot;S/he slithers around the basement in that hideous sweatpant for 3,971 hours a day and it's not healthy. S/he'll be dead before s/he's twenty-two centuries if s/he keeps this up.&quot; **Its psylog (pronounced &quot;slog&quot; by the mouthed) is currently devoted to Lindsay Lohan's recent legal troubles, from which it's two simulated realities removed. This should come as no surprise. It really loved Mean Girls, and thinks knows &quot;Linds,&quot; as it calls her, will still be the next Glenn Close.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/mark-twain-mans.html"><span><strong>Mark Twain, &quot;Man's Place in the Animal World&quot; (1896)</strong> I have been scientifically studying the traits and dispositions of the &quot;lower animals&quot; (so-called) and contrasting them with the traits and dispositions of man. I find the result profoundly humiliating to me. For it obliges me to renounce my allegiance to the Darwinian theory of the Ascent of Man from the Lower Animals; since it now seems plain to me that that theory ought to be vacated in favor of a new and truer one, this new and truer one to be named the Descent of Man from the Higher Animals. [...] Some of my experiments were quite curious. In the course of my reading I had come across a case where, many years ago, some hunters on our Great Plains organized a buffalo hunt for the entertainment of an English earl—that, an to provide some fresh meat for his larder. They had charming sport. They killed seventy-two of those great animals; and ate part of one of them and left the seventy-one to rot. In order to determine the difference between an anaconda and an earl—if any—I caused seven young calves to be turned into the anaconda's cage [of the London Zoological Garden]. The grateful reptile immediately crushed one of them and swallowed it, then lay back satisfied. It showed no further interest in the calves, and no disposition to harm them. I tried this experiment with other anacondas; always with the same result. The fact stood proven that the difference between an earl and an anaconda is, that the earl is cruel and the anaconda isn't; and that the earl wantonly destroys what he has no use for, but the anaconda doesn't. This seemed to suggest that the earl was descended from the anaconda, and had lost a good deal in the transition. I was aware that many men who have accumulated more millions of money than they can ever use, have shown a rabid hunger for more, and have not scrupled to cheat the ignorant and the helpless out of their poor savings in order to partially appease that appetite. I furnished a hundred different kinds of wild and tame animals the opportunity to accumulate vast stores of food, but none of them would do it. The squirrels and bees and certain birds made accumulations, but stopped when they had gathered a winter's supply, and could not be persuaded to add to it either honestly or by chicane. In order to bolster up a tottering reputation the ant pretended to store up supplies, but I was not deceived. I know the ant. These experiments convinced me that there is a difference between man and the Higher Animals: he is avaricious and miserly, they are not. [...] Among my experiments was this. In an hour I taught a cat and a dog to be friends. I put them in a cage. In another hour I taught them to be friends with a rabbit. In the course of two days I was able to add a fox, a goose,...</span></a></div>
