<p><strong>
Abstract:</strong></p>

<p>Under labratory conditions three groups of infinite numbers of
monkeys (hereafter, INM) were given a corresponding infinite number of
word processors (Hamilton, et al., 2003, having shown definitively that
no overall difference in results obtained from the use of word

<p>Group A were raised in a physical environment consisting of nothing
but Elizabethan architecture. Group B were raised under normal monkey
conditions, but then given intensive exposure to and instruction in the
field of Elizabethan architecture. Group C, the control group, were
allowed no exposure to Elizabethan or neo-Elizabethan architecture.</p>

<p>The three INM groups were monitored in real time, and their literary
output, including fragments and drafts, were compared to all of
Shakespeare's plays. At the end of ST, no disceranble difference was
present in the literary output of each INM grouping. The three grops
did produce variations on the plays' known plots and characters. For
example, Group A produced a variation on &quot;Othello&quot; in which Desdemona,
not actually dead, but only winded and contused, arose at the end of
the play, only to kill herself again. Group C, produced a number of
versions of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; in which Shylock is indeed awarded

limp for the remainder of the play. In each case, however, the INM
grouping also eventually produced the more tradtional versions of the
plays and the variations that they produced were not found to correlate
meanigfully with their exposure to Elizabethan architecture.</p>

<p>Based on INM Simian Modeling Theory, then, no correlation has been
found between Elizabethan architecture and Shakespeare's plays.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="comment-content">&nbsp;</div></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the issue is that scholars in the humanities aim (or need) not to be &quot;right&quot; but to be interesting? A while back Amardeep Singh had an interesting post about &quot;smart&quot; vs. &quot;sound&quot; scholarship: &quot;Rigor takes the frame of scientific proof; smart the frame of the market, which mandates interest amid a crowd of competitors. Deeming something smart, to use Kant&#39;s framework, is a judgment of taste rather than a judgment of reason. Like most judgments of taste, it is finally a measure of the people who hold it or lack it.&quot; (<a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/~amsp/2004/12/smart-criticism-vs-gooduseful-academic.html" rel="nofollow">The rest of his post is here.</a>)<br />

		<span id="comment-106740626-content"><p>It all depends on the type and level of claims made in the scholarship.  If I want to show the influence of Constance Rourke&#39;s ideas about American humor on Ishmael Reed, I can begin with Reed&#39;s bibliography to *Mumbo Jumbo*, where he cites Rourke&#39;s work as a source.  That gives me some pretty solid evidence.  I can certainly go wrong in assessing the extent of that influence, but the evidence and proof will be pretty clear-cut.</p>

<p>A close reading also has a fairly clear-cut evidence and proof situation.  If I find a pattern, I had better had proof of that pattern, etc.</p>

<p>Higher level humanities claims are harder to prove and impossible to disprove, once they get a grip on the field.  There are two reasons for this: first of all, no single atoms of evidence can individually disprove large-scale claims.  It&#39;s a geological process, a slow accretion of problems with the paradigm, as Kuhn might say.  Second, influential large-scale claims become part of a canon of ideas that, even when no longer seen as accurate, are seen as necessary background on an intellectual field.  (Freud&#39;s work is a great example here: it&#39;s simply necessary to read him, even if tomorrow, a neurobiologist could with complete certainty prove how the mind/brain works.)</p>

<p>So one question might be: should a field limit itself to those smaller-order claims?  Would that be more intellectually responsible?  What would be lost?  Should art criticism be completely inductive?  Is such induction itself an illusion?  (As William James writes of all experience, the connections are all we experience, while the Lockean bits and atoms are conceptual fictions.)  New Criticism tried to ground itself in those smaller scale readings of individual, relatively brief art works.  But is the field of poetry, say, merely a collection of bits, or rather an immense network of relationships from the start?</p>

<p>Which is to say: if the higher order claims are necessary but necessarily unprovable and at times unfalsifiable, might not the model of hard sciences simply not be an accurate model for the human sciences?  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-106765226-content"><p><i>Perhaps the issue is that scholars in the humanities aim (or need) not to be &quot;right&quot; but to be interesting?</i></p>

<p>See, I guess I don&#39;t understand why these should be opposed rather than separate categories.</p>

<p>We all need to produce work that is interesting if we want others to read it.  This is partly a question of existing academic tastes, but interesting works can also shift the market, convincing us to take seriously questions and subjects that previously held little interest (indeed, especially for junior scholars, like me, the trick seems to be balancing novelty and familiarity).  On the other hand, while one can build a certain kind of career around a reputation as a serious but over-reaching provocateur, for one&#39;s scholarship to gain respect and influence it has to be persuasive, rather than simply interesting.</p>

<p>It seems to me that we have plenty of tools for evaluating whether an argument is a reasonable one, even if it can&#39;t be definitively proven or disproven.  To take Scott&#39;s original satire, faced with the argument that <i>The Clansman</i> is an exercise in eroticized negrophillia, one isn’t simply reduced to declaring, “That’s preposterous.”  One could argue structurally that these examples are tenuous and cherry-picked, and that, even if accepted, they are more than counter-balanced by the rest of the book.  One could present evidence for a different kind of authorial intent, or show that contemporaneous readers did not in fact experience the novel in this way.  Finally, one could point out that a claim based on the principle that the world is exactly what I say that it is, is a very weak kind of knowledge claim, and one that is subject to immediate displacement.  None of these would disprove the original argument as such, but they would demonstrate why it’s not persuasive. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-106766120-content"><p>I&#39;m reminded of the ongoing debate over Said&#39;s <i>Orientalism</i>, and Foucault&#39;s <i>Discipline and Punish</i>, two works which were immensely influential but whose factual basis and interpretive methods have been criticized in recent years, to the point of calling the value of their methods into question. At this point it would be irresponsible for an historian to use either of them in a teaching situation without also offering caveats or counter-readings and I doubt they should be cited without the footnote also hedging a bit.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s work like Chang&amp;Halliday&#39;s <i>Mao: The Untold Story</i> which is: a) a masterwork of new archival research; b) a hit-piece fueled by personal and ideological animosity; c) both of the above..... The reviews that I&#39;ve seen have been either strongly positive (mostly from known conservative writers and non-historians) or strongly negative (mostly from actual historians of China). It contains claims which are crying out for independent evaluation and confirmation, and final judgement on the book is going to have to wait until that happens, which is not a position most reviewers are willing to take.</p></span>

Really?</strong> [I meant to post this on Edge of the American West, but Eric and Ari neglected to give me the admin privileges I so richly deserve, so I'm stuck posting it here.] According to the Wall Street Journal, Governor Spitzer will be charged with violating what is popularly called the Mann Act, but which Congress passed as the White Slave Traffic Act. It was designed to &quot;regulate interstate commerce and foreign commerce by prohibiting the transportation therein for immoral purposes of women and girls, and for other purposes.&quot; That the bill prohibits transportation for &quot;immoral purposes&quot; and &quot;other purposes&quot; is as problematically vague as you suppose. Shortly after its passage, the Virginia Law Review voiced its concern that those phrases grant: the statute such sweeping comprehensiveness as to include every form of conduct contrary to good order. Or as the New York Times put it: GIVES WIDE SCOPE TO WHITE SLAVE LAW _____ Supreme Court Holds That the Act is Not Limited to Com- mercialized Vice. ________ INCLUDES ESCAPADES ALSO The Act not only included escapades, it threatened to criminalize all larks, shenanigans, antics, frolics, capers, flings, and high jinks—at least as practiced by the citizenry. Because the very same ambiguity allowed ideologues in police departments and district attorney offices to prosecute anyone and everyone for anything and everything. The first person arrested under the act, heavy-weight champion Jack Johnson, was charged with consorting with his white wife shortly after defeating &quot;The Great White Hope&quot; in &quot;The Fight of the Century&quot; in what is most certainly a coincidence. (Also coincidental: the judge who presided over Johnson's case was none other than Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who while serving as the commissioner of Major League Baseball, blocked the sale of teams to owners who would integrate their roster.) As H.L. Mencken noted, this expansiveness was a feature, not a bug: It was carried through Congress, over the veto of President Taft, who discerned its extravagance, on the plea that it was needed to put down the traffic in prostitutes; it is enforced today against men who are no more engaged in the traffic in prostitutes than you or I. Naturally enough, the effect of this extension of its purposes, against which its author has publicly protested, has been to make it a truly deadly weapon in the hands of professional Puritans and of denouncers of delinquency even less honest. &quot;Blackmailers of both sexes have arisen,&quot; says Mr. Justice McKenna, &quot;using the terrors of the construction now sanctioned by the [Supreme] Court as a help—indeed, the means—for their brigandage. The result is grave and should give us pause.&quot; Lest you think Mencken's merely grinding another of his innumerable axes, in 1936 the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology comforts its readers with this balm salve: Although many believe the &quot;Mann Act&quot; has become a dead letter through the policy of non-enforcement, a recent statement by J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations, shows that this is not true. He said:...</span></a></div>

PART THE SECOND: Acephalous still has a Facebook group. You're more than welcome to become a charter member. (One day that might even mean something. Something inexpensive, sure, but something nonetheless.) PART THE THIRD: If you've linked to something I've written, don't expect me to respond. It's not that I don't want to, it's just highly unlikely I know you've written it. Once upon a time, before &quot;My Morning&quot; had been re-re-re-re-reposted to a million spam-blogs, I had a Google Alert to inform me when someone linked to Acephalous. But I couldn't handle the hundreds of legitimate emails the spam-blogs prompted, so I turned the Alert off. Now when you link to me, I have no way of knowing. (Unless I subscribe to your RSS feed, in which case I'll discover the link about five days later when I catch up on my blog reading ... and feel like a cad for not having responded sooner.) If you respond to something I write and want me to read it, send me an email saying as much. Otherwise, you'll have to rely on your site popping up on the rare occasions I check my stats. (Which ain't too often.)</span></a></div>
