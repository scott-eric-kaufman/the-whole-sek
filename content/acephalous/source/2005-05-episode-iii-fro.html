		<span id="comment-5851185-content"><p>Even the special effects looked worse, in my opinion, because of the CGI.  Those original puppets and mechanical gizmos were amazing.  They were expensive, which meant that they had to be used frugally, which meant that you had maybe just three or four robots or space ships on the screen at any given time, used to maximum effect, rather than 1,000 pointless doodads puttering about and making stupid squeaking sounds in every scene.  Even puppet Yoda looked kind of cool - way cooler than CGI Kung-Fu flying super Yoda.</p></span>

The most difficult class I teach as Senior Instructor of Literary Journalism--and yes, those are airs--is the one in which I foolishly attempt to convince students who don't know from irony what on God's Green Earth is happening in a Joan Didion article. I decided to lighten the ironical load this quarter, eschewing the subtle irony of &quot;Some Dreamers of the Golden Dream&quot; in favor of the hammer of &quot;Comrade Laski, C.P.U.S.A. (M.-L.).&quot; Here's how the conversation typically progresses: Me: So, class, what's irony? Class: (in unison) I-ron-y is when Chand-ler from Friends says &quot;Could you be any more in-tell-i-gent.&quot; Me: Alright, that's sarcasm, but let's build on that... So, as I was saying, the hammer: The world Michael Laski had constructed for himself was one of labyrinthine intricacy and immaculate clarity, a world made meaningful not only by high purpose but by external and internal threats, intrigues and apparatus, an immutably ordered world in which things mattered. (65) Actually, that's not the hammer. This is the hammer: He was born twenty-six years ago in Brooklyn, moved as a child to Los Angeles, dropped out of U.C.L.A. his sophomore year to organize for the Retail Clerks, and now, as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party U.S.A. (Marxist-Leninist), a splinter group of Stalinist-Maoists who divide their energies between Watts and Harlem, he is rigidly committed to an immutable complex of doctrine, including the notion thats that the traditional American Communist Party is a &quot;revisionist bourgeois clique,&quot; that the Progressive Labor Party, the Trotskyites, and the &quot;revisionist clique headed by Gus Hall&quot; prove themselves opportunistic bourgeois lackeys by making their peace appeal not to the &quot;workers&quot; but to the liberal imperialists; and that H. Rap Brown is the tool, if not the conscious agent, of the ruling imperialist class. (61-62) Typing that out...imagining for a second that those might be my words...makes me aware of how my pretensions to writing are only a vacuous but succoring fiction...something I tell myself to justify my existence. Didion simply diminishes, demolishes Comrade Laski clause by clause by clause...as these ellipses indicate, there's a way in which I can analyze it or appreciate it...and I'm inclined, as always, to appreciation. I'm this close to whipping out Slouching Toward Bethlehem, so that I might share the highlights of the titular essay, but I'll refrain. Because I want to save it. Sometimes pure, unadulterated admiration of another's prose is the healthiest thing imaginable for a struggling writer...and sometimes it isn't. But it's far more satisfying that re-re-re-reading the intellectual excrement I've managed to dissertate today.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/now_for_somethi.html"><span><strong>Now For Something Completely Different: Lessig vs. The American BoyChoir</strong> Quickly: Everyone who knows me knows my love for Lessig. Check out this article. I'll leave the legal analysis up to the experts, so this'll be short. Imagine you're a lawyer defending someone against charges of sexual molestation. Imagine you arrive in court to find that the person accusing your client has hired a new attorney. The plaintiff isn't wealthy. You're not worried. Then: In. Walks. Lawrence. Lessig. Imagine you shit your shorts. Imagine you look for somewhere to hide. Imagine you shit your shorts again when it's revealed that the plaintiff wasn't the only one molelsted by your client: So. Was. Lawrence. Lessig. Give 'em every last bit of what they deserve, Lawrence: Every. Last. Bit. EDIT: To those who emailed me saying this post was inappropriately glib, I want to say that 1) I understand where you're coming from, 2) I appreciate that you maintained a civil tone in your responses, but 3) my admiration for Lessig and his work compels me to think in these terms. I'm not making light of what he's had to suffer through; I'm expressing a grander social gratification that he's not only managed to survive it but is in a position to do something about it. Many people don't and aren't.</span></a></div>
