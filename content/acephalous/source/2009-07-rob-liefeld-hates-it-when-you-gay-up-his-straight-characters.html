The evidence that the actual Spartans were homosexual [thanks James] is scant and somewhat contradictory. In the most frequently cited classical source, &quot;The Polity of the Lacedaemons,&quot; Xenephon insists that the Spartans were not homosexual in the manner of the Boetians and Eleians: I ought, as it seems to me, not to omit some remark on the subject of boy attachments, it being a topic in close connection with that of boyhood and the training of boys. We know that the rest of the Hellenes deal with this relationship in different ways, either after the manner of the Boeotians, where man and boy are intimately united by a bond like that of wedlock, or after the manner of the Eleians, where the fruition of beauty is an act of grace; whilst there are others who would absolutely debar the lover from all conversation and discourse with the beloved. Lycurgus adopted a system opposed to all of these alike. Given that some one, himself being all that a man ought to be, should in admiration of a boy's soul endeavour to discover in him a true friend without reproach, and to consort with him—this was a relationship which Lycurgus commended, and indeed regarded as the noblest type of bringing up. But if, as was evident, it was not an attachment to the soul, but a yearning merely towards the body, he stamped this thing as foul and horrible; and with this result, to the credit of Lycurgus be it said, that in Lacedaemon the relationship of lover and beloved is like that of parent and child or brother and brother where carnal appetite is in abeyance. (301, emphasis mine) Note that while there are no carnal relations allowed in Sparta, the male-male couple is still referred to as &quot;lover and beloved,&quot; which leads me to believe this could be a rough Spartan equivalent of the Sacred Band of Thebes. The other most frequently cited ancient source cited on homosexuality in Sparta is Plutarch's &quot;Life of Lycurgus,&quot; in which he describes the wedding night and connubial bliss of the married Spartan couple thus: Then the woman that had the direction of the wedding, cut the bride's hair close to the skin, dressed her in man's clothes, laid her upon a mattress, and left her in the dark. The bridegroom, neither oppressed with wine, nor enervated with luxury, but perfectly sober, as having always supped at the common table, went in privately, untied her girdle, and carried her to another bed. Having stayed there a short time, he modestly retired to his usual apartment, to sleep with the other young men; and he observed the same conduct afterwards, spending the day with his companions, and reposing himself with them in the night, nor even visiting his bride, but with great caution and apprehensions of being discovered by the..." />

<p>Sorry about that Anthony, I meant to answer it before: the Foucauldian notion still holds sway in the humanities, but I can&#39;t speak for the social sciences.  However, it&#39;s not as over-arching as it once was, thanks to the work of a lot of (largely) scholars of Irish Modernist literature (or scholars who happen to be dipping into Irish Modernist literature) like Neil Bartlettt, whose <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852421231/diesekoschmar-20" rel="nofollow"><em>Who Was That Man?</em></a> (about Oscar Wilde) actually delves into the minutiae of social and legal history in an effort to put some flesh to those Foucauldian bones.  That said, in any but the loosest sense I don&#39;t buy the Foucault, because while it may be true that they didn&#39;t define it like us, that doesn&#39;t mean that the category itself is somehow invalid . . . just like, to draw from my own work, just because someone isn&#39;t talking about Darwinian evolution doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re not talking about the development of species over time.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef011570e271b2970c-content"><p>Anthony, I&#39;m not sure what Scott was going for, but I&#39;d say that in the years since Foucault was writing <i>History of Sexuality</i> and the like that &quot;homosexual&quot; has fallen far enough out of common usage that it seems less presentist than &quot;gay&quot;, but not so far out that it seems like a historically specific formulation, like &quot;invert&quot; or &quot;Urning.&quot;  Of course, Foucault&#39;s point was that everything is epistemeic (I know that&#39;s probably not an acceptable adjectival mash-up), so there is no acceptable trans-historical terminology.  Even abstracted alienated terms like &quot;same-sex erotic relations&quot; take on a specific historical value the moment they&#39;re popularized, even if they might be more useful in the moment for remind us that we shouldn&#39;t assume that men having sex with men in earlier and/or non-Western societies are necessarily homosexuals or gay men as we understand them.</p>

<p>At which poin I will presume to spek for what Scott was doing, because it seems to me that what he was trying to do was in fact to point out, ala Foucault vol. II,  that Spartan same-sex relations, such as we are able to know them, don&#39;t reduce to gay/not gay in the way that Liefeld quote would presume they could. (One presumes that Liefeld would respond &quot;I wasn&#39;t talking about <i>Sparta</i> Sparta. I just meant all serious warrior badmotherfucker-like.&quot; Or something.  I don&#39;t really know who these comic book people are.) In doing so, SEK used some of that same vernacular language in a trans-historical way.  This may have udercut or made his point more persuasive, depending on the sort of driving that you do, the quality of your tires, and other mileage varying things.</p>

<p>At the same time, this<br />
<i>behaviors that range from &quot;overtly homosexual&quot; to &quot;extremely homosocial,&quot;</i><br />
I don&#39;t like.  If &quot;homosocial&quot; means anything useful it has to be seperable -- not opposed, but seperable, and therefor not meaningfully part of a spectrum -- from sexual relations. Otherwise you&#39;re essentially saying &quot;Dude, they were so bromantic, they were totally gay for each other.&quot;  Michel would indeed tsk.</p></span>

Here&#39;s the opening to the essay:<blockquote>Medievalists know that if they claim to have found &quot;homosexuals&quot; in the Middle Ages they will provoke cries of outrage, and nothing else they say will be heard. So they avoid the term. Thus Allen Frantzen, on the very first page of Before the Closet: Same-Sex Love from &quot;Beowulf&quot; to &quot;Angels in America,&quot; declares categorically: &quot;I call this a book about &#39;same-sex love&#39; because the obvious choice, &#39;homosexuality,&#39; is, for periods before the modern era, inaccurate. &#39;Homosexuality&#39; and &#39;homosexuals&#39; were not recognized concepts in the Middle Ages.&quot; Apparently, the same is not true of &quot;heterosexuality&quot; and &quot;heterosexuals.&quot; Frantzen does not hesitate, throughout his volume, to oppose &quot;same-sex relations&quot; to &quot;heterosexual relations.&quot; 1 The result is a Middle Ages that would make Pat Buchanan jump for joy, one from which all the homosexuals have been banished and only heterosexuals remain.</p>

<p>This should give one pause. If homosexuality was not a &quot;recognized concept&quot; in the Middle Ages, then heterosexuality wasn&#39;t either. This in itself is not a reason to argue against its use: much of the best work in medieval studies relies on concepts that were not recognized in the Middle Ages. And, in any case, to insist that medieval scholarship limit itself to medieval concepts in their medieval meanings is to insist on an impossibility. I want to argue against the use of heterosexuality in medieval studies not as a matter of high principle but as a practical matter because of the damage it does.</p>

<p>To be sure, other scholars have questioned the wisdom of imposing the heterosexual norm on the Middle Ages. 2 Karma Lochrie makes the point [End Page 14] with exemplary clarity: &quot;Heterosexuality as a normative principle simply did not exist&quot; in the Middle Ages. 3 But Lochrie, like others, voices her objections as part of a larger argument on a different topic. Perhaps it is for this reason that the case against heterosexuality has not carried the day. In what follows I propose to isolate the issue and illustrate the consequences, both historiographical and political, of reading heterosexuality backward into the Middle Ages. </blockquote></p></span>

In October 2008, Andrew McCarthy complained that it was impossible to learn anything about Obama’s heady days of Ayers-inspired radicalism at Columbia: As [Ayers] so delicately told the Times, America makes him “want to puke” . . . Such statements should make Obama unelectable. Time and again, conservatives have proven that Obama is Ayers is Alinsky is Annenberg is Hitler—all they were lacking was the actual proof. No more. Thanks to the Times, they now have the evidence they were always pretty sure existed. How did the Times get their hands on these hot documents? What did it do that McCarthy—a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York—could not? It asked politely. Question: May I use Columbia’s libraries if I am not a student, professor, or staff member at another academic institution? Answer: If your public library does not have the specific title or material you need for your research, obtain a referral card from your public library. This card will give you a one-day pass to Columbia University Libraries. All McCarthy had to do to stop a man he considered a monster from winning the White House was return to his old stomping grounds and ask a librarian for a day-pass to Columbia. All any conservative who wanted to stop a man they believed would destroy America had to do was to obtain a referral card from a public library. Instead, these intrepid citizen-journalists prattled on endlessly about the research other people declined to do; and now that someone did it, they are incorporating their lazy reliance on the mainstream media into another iteration of their tired jeremiad against it: “If only you had told me what I couldn’t have been bothered to discover myself last year,” they cry, “Obama might not be in Russia today sowing the seeds of our inevitable destruction.” If you believed that a trip into the city and an afternoon in an archive would spare America four years of tyranny, would you do it? Would you fly into the city, rent a room, borrow a library card, request a day-pass under false pretenses, and spend an afternoon in an archive if you believed that doing so might save the world from nuclear destruction? Or would you whine because no one will silver-platter you a smoking gun? We know what route the conservative punditry took, but who are we to begrudge them their moment of vindication? The Times finally got around to finding their smoking gun for them. They now have incontrovertible proof that Obama held, holds, and will forever harbor deeply radical thoughts; that he held, holds, and will forever adhere to an ideology hostile to American ideals and interests; that he held, holds, and will forever—but we should allow him the courtesy of hanging by his own rope: The more sensitive among us...</span></a></div>
