<blockquote>I don&#39;t think for reals that the Kitely person was actually associated with any of Mr. Jeff&#39;s political views...</blockquote>

<p>Neither do I, but he was listed as someone who helped Jeff become the man he&#39;s become despite not having spoken to him in years.  I can understand why he&#39;d want to distance himself from someone whose website he finds odious.  </p>

<blockquote>the Kitely person took it upon himself to proactively assert that he was somehow getting besmirched by an association with unfashionable views, which I think was a bit precious of him, really.</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any claim of preemptive besmirching: it&#39;s simply a case of, how to put this: Jeff claims that his training in literary theory led him to believe X; he also claims that the person he studied under was Kitely, who happens to find X reprehensible; because Kitely doesn&#39;t believe that literary theory leads to X, he would rather not have a vocal proponent of X claiming, however implicitly, that Kitely thinks it does.  Does that make sense?  </p>

<p>JLR:</p>

<blockquote>Do you really have a lisp? Either way, please start spelling as if you do.</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t.  Jeff&#39;s referring to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJk9bM-3qw" rel="nofollow">this video</a> in which, you know, I don&#39;t have a lisp.  Not only do I not have a lisp, but I did a decade of speech therapy in order to not sound like a deaf person—the result of which is, of course, that despite being a Jew from New York, I sound nothing like a New York Jew; and that despite having lived in the South most of my life, outside of saying &quot;y&#39;all&quot; because I prefer my languages have second-person plurals, I don&#39;t sound like I&#39;m from the South.  So I&#39;m not sure where they&#39;re getting the lisp comment from, outside of the obvious, you know: they think I&#39;ll be wounded if they claim I sound &quot;gay,&quot; because for them, sounding &quot;gay&quot; would be the worst possible thing in the world ever.</p></span>

<p>Only slightly: Jeff and JD throw a fit every time the WordPress platform sends <em>an automatic</em> trackback to his place on account of (previously) <em>Edge of the American West</em> and (now) <em>LGM</em> both running on WordPress.  You see, that sort of automatic process is high calumny, right up there with sending a diplomatic email.</p>

<p>Jake:</p>

<p><em>Where did all this rancor against Protein Wisdom originate? </em></p>

<p>It didn&#39;t start with rancor, but with common cause: we both worked with (in the loosest sense of the phrase) Walter Benn Michaels and share (again, loosely) Michaels&#39; notion of how identity politics work; we&#39;ve always, however, differed on the question of whether they&#39;re necessarily pernicious—Goldstein and Michaels think they are, I don&#39;t, but am frequently annoyed when issues of class are subsumed into race-cum-culture, as Michaels describes.  So, initially I was the sort of liberal academic Jeff liked, which is why, completely unaware of how his current treatment of me undermines the very point he&#39;s trying to make, he&#39;ll write stuff <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=17489" rel="nofollow">like this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>When I noted that people were free to comment on the site and voice their opposition, Kiteley told me of my propensity for stifling opposition — which would come as a surprise to the commenters who visited to call Darleen a racist, etc. Or to the number of people on the left — from Nishi, to SEK, to Jeralyn Merritt — I’ve invited to guest post here over the years.</blockquote>

<p>Which, of course, would be a valid point were it not for the fact that since I had the gall to take a position that was later proven to be, <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/07/newsflash-ordin.html" rel="nofollow">if not true, believable in light of subsequent events</a>, they&#39;ve decided not only that I&#39;m the enemy, but that I&#39;m embodiment of all that is ruinous about academia, about which I have two points to make:</p>

<p>First, all the ink they spilled over how Scott Beauchamp was a liar and a fraud; how soldiers would never behave like shell-shocked 20-year-olds in a combat zone; how Beauchamp doesn&#39;t care about his country, but was only in Iraq to discredit the military—basically, every position they held in that debate was shot to shit when <a href="http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=60885" rel="nofollow">the actual state of discipline</a> in Beauchamp&#39;s unit was revealed.  After all, their contention was that the mere suggestion that soldiers would mock a burn victim or play with a skull fragment is treasonous propaganda, because American G.I.s would never do anything of the sort, etc.</p>

<p>Second, in the years since then, Jeff constantly uses me as a symbol of academic brain-rot, and his commenters act as if I&#39;m at the pinnacle of the academic pyramid so that my fall, or whatever, will be from far greater heights.  You can point out to them that I&#39;m a lecturer at a the institution that granted me my doctorate, have one publication to my name and only two others in the pipes, and that I live in the poorer section of Riverside County; but in their mind, and I use the singular emphatically here, I&#39;m a tenured professor of high repute who lives in a mansion up on University Hills.  It&#39;s really rather sad, when you think about it—which they do, all the time, and people who read over there shoot me emails because my ears never burn on cue.</p></span>

<p>&quot;If you are employed in certain professional fields, like academia, you no longer have freedom of speech, only the freedom to parrot what your leftist colleagues say lest your career be put in jeopardy.  That is no way to live, and it is why any love or respect I ever had for academia died long ago.&quot;</p>

I have a confession: I have never watched or listened to Glenn Beck for any sustained period of time. I’d read transcriptions of his rambling monologues and seen parodies of his lunatic shtick, but until today, I’d avoided prolonged exposure to the Glenn Beck Experience. Would that I could still say the same. As a public service to anyone else out there who might be tempted to try and understand his appeal, I offer the following transcript of the horrors I witnessed condensed down to their rhetorical appeals: Good evening, America, I am you. Do you know what you hate? Let me tell you: You hate it when people tell you what to think. Do you want to be told what to think? Let me tell you: You don’t. You hate it when people tell you what to think. You’re an independent thinker, and what do all independent thinkers hate? Let me tell you: You hate to be told what to think, because you're an independent thinker. How should you feel about being told what to think? Let me tell you: You should feel insulted by these people who are telling you what to think. What does being talked down to by Washington elites make you feel like? Let me tell you: Being talked down to by Washington elites makes you feel like a child. How should you feel when Washington elites treat you like a child? Let me tell you: You should be outraged that Washington elites are trying to tell you how to live your life. How should you live your life? Let me tell you: You should live your life with freedom, because you're an independent thinker. What should you do when condescending Washington elites treat you and other independents just like you like children? Let me tell you: You should buy my book, because you're an independent thinker, and my book tells independent thinkers what they think. To be honest, I expected something more. I assumed Jon Stewart’s parody of Beck was a parody, but I was wrong—the Glenn Beck shows demonstrates that a significant number of American adults have the intellectual maturity of a punk apologist insisting that until you listen their favorite band, you’ll never learn to think for yourself. I honestly expected Beck to possess more rhetorical savvy than a teenage version of myself, but if you replace “America” with “the Replacements,” the resemblance is uncanny. (Before you say anything: I understand that I’m so late to the party that I shouldn’t even bother posting this, but I’ll risk inevitable redundancy in order to register the magnitude of my shock.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/03/on-the-moral-universe-of-mark-millar-which-makes-little-sense-but-frequently-explodes.html"><span><strong>On the moral universe of Mark Millar (which is incoherent, but frequently explodes)</strong> By now, you know how I feel about Mark Millar; but until I read Nemesis, I couldn't have accounted for why my dislike has always been so visceral. Turns out, all I needed was to witness his treatment of a character I have more than a fleeting investment in to figure it out. For those unfamiliar with it, the premise of the book is, according to Millar: What if Batman was a total cunt? Mystery solved! I react poorly to Millar's work because despite its adult themes, adult language, and adult visuals, it is written by a child and intended to appeal to readers who live in a world devoid of moral complexity.* It's no accident that The Ultimates opens with Captain America fighting Nazis: Millar's attracted to the cleanliness of the period, i.e. to wars whose necessity is self-evident, because that allows him to focus on action-packed-violence as an end in itself. Moreover, when the body of Steve Rogers is discovered in the second issue, it provides Millar an opportunity to import what he considers a laudable moral simplicity into our decidedly complex historical moment. What began bad quickly turns awful, as Millar decides to follow in the footsteps of Adrian Veidt and unite the world by means of an invasion of aliens who are also Nazis; but the worst part about his game of perpetual one-upmanship is that, unlike Veidt, there is precious little evidence that Millar even momentarily weighs the moral consequences of his fictional narrative. He enlists the aid of intergalactic Nazi financiers because both can be slaughtered with impunity, and for pages and pages, the reader is treated to exactly that: violence unburdened of the need to justify its existence because these Nazis aren't even people, so why should there be a check as to the degree or kind of violence acts perpetrated against them? The problem with Millar's role-reversal should be obvious: The Ultimates is a What If...? title that explores what would happen if the Nazis were considered less than human instead of the Jews. Millar loves &quot;the flip&quot; more than any other narrative device, but in The Ultimates (as in Red Son), he is incapable of thinking through the consequences his counterfactuals have for his characters. In The Ultimates, for example, he failed to notice that he transformed Captain America into jingoistic ass presiding over an abattoir, meaning his reversion to the uncomplicated and sympathetic character he had been reads false. You would think—you would hope—that Millar would notice that there's something disturbing about slotting Captain America into the spot reserved for Nazis in that analogy, but he doesn't. His characters are who they are and they can be no one else, which means the possibility for character development is limited to the teleological process of becoming who you were destined to be, e.g. Superman and Batman in Red Son, both of whom embody the essence of their characters in their purest form despite having been born and raised in the Soviet...</span></a></div>
