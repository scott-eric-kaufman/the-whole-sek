Although this comment belongs to the tedious category of &quot;complaints about bloggers having blogs and writing about stuff on them,&quot; it nevertheless struck a chord: first, because the size of the community grieving for Alex Chilton surprised me; and second, it seems to be a dangerous time to be a living artist or academic who changed my life. That said, this annoying anonymous person is reading in bad faith: not everyone who influenced me did so greatly or uniquely, which is why I noted Kurt Vonnegut's passing in passing, as a &quot;Vonnegut phase&quot; is required to join the community of readers. The same cannot be said of those academics and artists with whom I shared an intimate relationship over many years, which is why I wrote individual remembrances of Octavia Butler, David Foster Wallace, Howard Zinn, or Alex Chilton. If I seem to be too familiar a type, blame central casting: academics play the part because that's the part they've been asked to play.

Let me add: I stopped adding items to the list when I started having to think about what belonged on it.&#0160; The only criterion for inclusion was that, at some point in my life, the publication or release of their newest thing felt like An Event.&#0160; (I never said it would be scientific.)&#0160; I can&#39;t account for how white and male it is, only apologize for being such a solipsist in my youth that I had a difficult time identifying with people who were not me.&#0160; (I might not have been treated like I was white, but as this list amply demonstrates, I certainly self-identify as such.)<br />
<p>I&#39;ve also most likely forgot a lot of things I used to love, and as such reserve the right to add items to any of the above lists should the death of someone not currently on them result in an unexpected gut-check.&#0160; </p>

<p>I was surprised by the number of bloggers I read who noted Chilton&#39;s death. I&#39;d never heard of him, and very little of what I read (noting, of course, that writing about music, especially music you love, rarely conveys the actual experience) suggested that I&#39;d really enjoy his stuff. But at some point I&#39;ll have to check out a few of the linked tracks and see, at least for some basic cultural literacy. </p></span>

<p>That&#39;s kind of a jerky thing to say. I&#39;ve read what I think is a healthy dose of long-ass Russian novels (Anna Karenina, Crime &amp; Punishment, Brothers Karamazov, War &amp; Peace, etc.) but a lot of reasonably literate people haven&#39;t heard of Lermontov so I like to take opportunities to talk him up. </p></span>

<p>Still only 80 pages, but point taken.</p>

<p><em>Not one  professional cricketer? For shame, Kaufman, for shame.</em></p>

<p>See, that&#39;s what I mean: I didn&#39;t even have any baseball players on the list.  Exceptions are already abounding, but basically, whenever an &#39;86 Met dies, I&#39;m going to be heartbroken.</p>

<p><em>I&#39;d never heard of him, and very little of what I read (noting, of course, that writing about music, especially music you love, rarely conveys the actual experience) suggested that I&#39;d really enjoy his stuff.</em></p>

<p>Ahistoricality: most of the posts I&#39;ve read have focused on the first two albums, but it&#39;s really <em>Third/Sister Lovers</em> that&#39;s influential.  Check out his haunting, drugged vocals on &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsQ977u8Wuk" rel="nofollow">Holocaust</a>,&quot; or the odd instrumentation on &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6a9yxUyOOI" rel="nofollow">Kangaroo</a>,&quot; or how Chilton lurched through pop on &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkeOnZiopo0" rel="nofollow">O Dana</a>&quot; or &quot;Stroke it Noel.&quot;  The songs are falling apart as they&#39;re being played, but they&#39;re breaking compellingly, with a conviction that authentically sound like compositions written by a broken man with impeccable pop sensibilities.  </p>

<p><em>Just pre-produce your obits like the newspapers do. That way you will only have to update the particulars of time and place but you&#39;ll have covered the bulk of their bodies of work. Maybe even guess their date of demise and post-mark your blog entries accordingly. Sure its a little macabre undertaking but a great writing exercise.</em></p>

<p>Jason, I need to dig up that old New Yorker article on the <em>Times</em>&#39; curator of obits, because it&#39;s 1) awesome, and 2) the description of what is and isn&#39;t notable pre-dates Wikipedia and its standards, but I don&#39;t remember how and want to.</p></span>

<p>Not so much, Jake.  I can&#39;t deny how powerful <em>Manufacturing Consent</em> was to me as a media-critical youth, but it was forever bumped from its pedestal by Robert McChesney&#39;s <em>Rich Media, Poor Democracy</em>, and the same can be said for most of Chomsky&#39;s political work.  As an undergraduate linguistics major, I&#39;m one of the few people who&#39;s read his political work and thinks <em>Syntactic Structure</em> and <em>Cartesian Linguistics</em> are crucial elements of any intellectual history of the 20th century.  I&#39;m less sanguine, though, about his attacks on what he considers postmodernism, for the obvious reasons.  (Which reminds me: I need to add Jameson to that list above, as he was the first living theorist whose works I barreled through.)<br />

<p>In all honesty, most of my political reading isn&#39;t in books these days, but long-form journalism and academic articles, so it&#39;s a toss up between <em>The Nation</em>, <em>The Economist</em>, <em>New Left Review</em>, etc.  My &quot;serious non-fiction book&quot; reading either concerns 1) academic works on comics or 2) secondary literature about late-19th Century American fiction, so I don&#39;t forget what I&#39;ll need should I ever go on the market as the Americanist I am (instead of the visual rhetoric scholar I&#39;m becoming).</p>

<p>Sean and Nick: </p>

<p>I mean the early, bouncy stuff.  Seriously, <em>Snow Crash</em> and <em>The Diamond Age</em> were heady, inventive literary thrillers that changed how I thought about our relation to technology; <em>Cryptonomicon</em> made me realize that it&#39;s possible for infodumps to be elegant, a realization I&#39;d later regret once I determined that Stephenson hadn&#39;t shared it, just lucked out.  (I&#39;m not sure about <em>Anathem</em>, which I started but had to put down shortly after it was published.)</p></span>

I've never tried to verify those rumors, though, because it was their believability that mattered more than their truth. For example, Alex Chilton indirectly named one of the most important albums of the 1990s via the resilience of a particular lyrical gesture: the sincerely feigned grand statement. On &quot;September Gurls,&quot; he sings: I loved you, well, never mind. I've been crying, all the time. That &quot;never mind&quot; alerts us to the fact that the narrator is a liar, albeit a sympathetic one, because if he were actually that nonchalant he wouldn't be &quot;crying all the time.&quot; Paul Westerberg picks up on the gesture on the aptly titled &quot;Never mind,&quot; in which he sings: It makes no sense, to apologize. The words, I thought, I brought, I left behind, So, never mind. All over but the shouting, just a waste of time. Never mind. Westerberg's delivery on the second line is ambiguously clipped: he sounds like someone on the verge of tears, but the reason for them could be that he has no idea what to say; that he knows that no matter what he says, it won't be enough; that he knew what to say, that he had the right words, but that he's forgotten them; or many an other et cetera. More important for our purposes is what Westerberg learned from Chilton, i.e. how to turn an explicit denial of any significance into an implicit statement of maximal importance. What looks like boilerplate passive-aggression on paper is, in &quot;Never mind,&quot; nothing of the sort: Westerberg shouts &quot;never mind&quot; like an interrupted stutterer, out of sheer frustration over his inability to articulate what he means. The result is that, as in &quot;September Gurls,&quot; the words intended to divest a situation of emotional import acquire the very significance their existence is intended to diminish. Which, of course, is why Kurt Cobain named Nirvana's second album after that Mats track and penned this: I found it hard, it's hard to find. Oh well, whatever, never mind. That lyric reads like a canned slacker response to adversity, and maybe it is; but in &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; the phrase appears a powerful song, so even absent any solid evidence that Cobain's citing Westerberg citing Chilton, I could believe he was. Such was the legend of Alex Chilton in 1991—a full year before Fantasy Records reissued #1 Record and Radio City, meaning that this is what I thought on the strength of the lyrics on the Bangles' cover of &quot;September Gurls&quot; and his work with the Box Tops. I had absolutely no idea what Big Star would sound like, only that Chilton was a force worth reckoning with. And so he was. I'd link to some of his catalog, but I'm still having problems listening to Big...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/03/andy-mccarthy-on-the-moral-superiority-of-cheaters.html"><span><strong>Andy McCarthy on the moral superiority of cheaters.</strong> Over on The Corner, Andy McCarthy unwittingly claims that Democrats are morally superior to Republicans: I know we tire of the hypocrisy, but I really think this is remarkable. We spent the eight years through January 19, 2009, listening to Democrats complain that President Bush had purportedly caused a constitutional crisis by issuing signing statements when he signed bills into law. Democrats and Arlen Specter (now a Democrat) complained that these unenforceable, non-binding expressions of the executive’s interpretation of the laws Bush was signing were a usurpation Congress’s power to enact legislation. But now Democrats are going to abide not a mere signing statement but an executive order that purports to have the effect of legislation—in fact, has the effect of nullifying legislation that Congress is simultaneously enacting? Democrats, he argues, were correct when they complained that signing statements were “unenforceable, non-binding expressions of the executive’s interpretation of the laws [and] a usurpation Congress’s power to enact legislation.” They were right to complain when the Bush administration appended them to legislation, but now they must defend the very principles conservatives have never had and stop President Obama from appending anything to H.R. 3590 when he signs it into law or be branded rank hypocrites. Consider this in baseball terms: It’s the top of the first, and McCarthy and likeminded conservatives—we’ll call them the Yankees—stride to the plate with a Reebok Vector O. When the liberal pitcher complains, the umpire merely shrugs his shoulders and shouts, “Play ball!” The pitcher opens with a wicked 12 to 6 curve over the heart of the plate. McCarthy stares at the mound in disbelief, then turns and says something to the umpire, who walks to the mound and informs the pitcher that there will be no more quote, bendy pitches, unquote. “What?” “You heard me,” the umpire replies. “McCarthy can’t hit anything but four-seamers, so that’s what you need to throw.” Dumbfounded, the pitcher steps on the rubber and launches a 95 m.p.h. four-seamer down the chute. McCarthy throws his hands in the air and again complains to the umpire, who again approaches the mound. “How is he supposed to hit a 95 m.p.h. fastball?” “Not very well, actually, is the idea” the pitcher replies. “I don’t want to see the gun touch anything over 80 from now on, we clear?” “You want me to throw batting practice fastballs?” “I don’t want you to, I’m telling you to,” the umpire says as he makes his way back to the plate. Needless to say, by the time the liberals record three outs, the Yankees are up by twenty-seven. In the dugout, the liberals notice that the grounds crew is not only relocating the mound 50 ft. from home plate, but raising it five inches; moreover, the Yankees’s starting pitcher is heading to the mound with a jar of Vaseline and an industrial sander. When they complain, the Yankees insist that this this non-regulation mound is actually regulation, and that they’re not doctoring balls so much...</span></a></div>
