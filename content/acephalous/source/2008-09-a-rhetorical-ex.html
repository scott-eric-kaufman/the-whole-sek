<p>I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;m willing to let go of that just yet, nor am I sure that it obviates your point to be aware of it. The first version is a screechy self-parody (of good music, anyway; I don&#39;t know from Smashing Pumpkins, myself) rhetorically (in a broad sense of rhetoric) appropriate to the movie; the second version is a self-important drama-fest, also very appropriate to the movie (as I understand it: Watchmen is one of the 80s classics I still haven&#39;t read*). </p>

<p>Also, I think the fact that the lyrics are plural just makes it that much more appropriate for the second movie.</p>

<p><br />
* I have <i>got</i> to figure out some way to get more interesting readings into my courses. History and influence of <i>manga</i>, maybe. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-131813776-content"><p>The lyrics are typically terrible --- if anyone&#39;s responsible for how awful emo became, it&#39;s Corgan.  The music?  Sonically wonderful, noisy-beautiful, whatever.  And Corgan&#39;s voice, bad as it is, was good-bad.  But Lord Almighty, if you paid attention the lyrics, you learned more about Cupids and vampires than you ever wanted to.  Not Led Zeppelin laughable, but pretty damn close.  </p>

<p>That said, you really ought to read <em>Watchmen</em>.  In fact . . . check your email.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-131816268-content"><p>ASK, I&#39;m conflicted as to how I feel about augurs of <em>Watchmen</em>.  On the one hand, Alan Moore distancing himself from it is <em>pro forma</em> at this point; on the other, Zack Snyder&#39;s a visual literalist, and the interview I read with Dave Gibbons indicated that the film is, in fact, slavish in its devotion to his panels.  But I don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s a good thing --- it&#39;s a better thing than what happened with <em>300</em>, but that&#39;s mostly because Miller&#39;s book was crap before he got his hands on it.  I was talking to [<em>a recent UCI Ph.D.</em>] who said his only problem with the trailer was that it indicated Snyder wouldn&#39;t take characterization too seriously . . . but he did cast Billy Crudup, who I really like, and who (outside of Night Owl) is the only character whose depth has any, um, <em>depth</em> to it, so I&#39;m not sure about that.</p>

<p>Put another way, this is a rare instance in which I think ignoring medium and being slavish devoted to source material might work out well.  This is only because Gibbons&#39; contributions to the book were so vital, so a lot of the storytelling load we&#39;d expect in exposition is handled by the staging of scenes --- the placement of a particular photograph, the out-of-focus reaction shot, &amp;c. --- all of which should translate well on film.  But this is (maybe) just wishful thinking on my part, really.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-131887052-content"><p>Well, the use of the song is ironic. I <i>really</i> don&#39;t care for the song at all, and using it to advertise <i>Watchmen</i> was like slathering on more sauce than necessary. When I heard it in the trailer, I was waiting for Don LaFontaine to announce &quot;In a world filled with <i>darkness</i> and <i>chaos</i>...&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather read the book than watch the movie. If all Zack Snyder is going to do is animate the panels of the book with his signature <i>slow</i>-fast-<i>slow</i> motion style and green screen effects, why watch the movie? How is seeing it on the big screen going to be different than (or supplementary to?) reading it? It looks like another attempt by studios to cash in on a comic book with a fan base guaranteed to purchase tickets. </p>

<p>I&#39;d have to see more footage, but more importantly I have to read the damn book.  </p></span>

Enjoy!) Had terrible insomnia last night. About 4 a.m. the cats triple-teamed the litter box. Cleaned it. Ran out of litter. Remembered I had more litter in the car. Walked down three flights of stairs and approached my car. WHOOP WHOOP! Cars only talk to other cars, I think, and continue to walk toward my car. WHOOP WHOOP! I look at the cruiser. A hand appears from the window and waves. Exhausted and somewhat confused, I waved back. WHOOP WHOOP! Now the hand points to the ground immediately next to the cruiser. I walk over. What is your business here? Cat litter, I reply. A little late to be buying cat litter, isn't it? I already bought it, I say, and point at the trunk my car. So if I open up your trunk there, all I'm going to find is cat litter, then? And a case of Dr. Pepper. I wanted that too. You live around here? I point to my building. There's been a report of a burglary and suspicious persons near here. I'll need to see some ID. I don't have any. You normally come down at 4 a.m. to fetch litter without ID? Normally I'm not awake. I have insomnia. I'm going to need you to put your hands behind your back and spread your legs. I comply, and for the first time in my adult life have my face pressed on the hood of a police cruiser. You're fine. Before you pop the trunk for me, you're sure I'm not going to find any surprises? I may have left a winter coat in there. No dope, no open containers, just Pepsi, litter, and maybe a jacket? I decide finding Dr. Pepper instead of Pepsi isn't the kind of surprise he means and bite my lip while he roots around. What's in this then? I crane my head backwards to look at the nondescript box in his hand and decide honesty is the best policy, so I tell him I have no idea what is in that then. So you can't say that it's not dope? I say I can certainly say that. The litter and Pepsi checks out. I'm not sure whether he says that to me or the squawker on his neck, so I say Mm-Hm. He puts the litter, the Dr. Pepper and the mysterious box on the hood of my car and waves me to him. You need to know what's in your boxes, you know? I tell him I know. How am I supposed to know this isn't stolen property if you don't know what's in it? I nod my head and tell him I should know what's in my boxes and that I'm not sure why I don't know what's in that one. So how can you be sure it's not dope? I say I'm not the sort of person...</span></a></div>
