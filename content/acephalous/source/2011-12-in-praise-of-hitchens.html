<p>Personally, though, my priorities are different. Whenever I read about somebody being sad that Hitchens is dead, my mind leaps to a picture of somebody else who is sad about his passing:</p>

And as someone opposed to the war, I&#39;m not going to defend his position on it, only say that he was at least thoughtfully wrong -- keep in mind he condemned the US for not going after Saddam during the first Gulf War, and reported on the plight of the Kurds in the aftermath of it when everyone else was slapping themselves on the back for a war well-done.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01543865e507970c-content"><p>To elaborate less bitchily:</p>

<p>Hitchens&#39;s support of the Iraq War was always, from the beginning, understood as defense of liberal democracy and secularism (<em>not</em> goddamn imperialism) against theocracy -- and it can&#39;t be separated from his own involvement in the disgraceful waffling that followed the <em>fatwa</em> against his friend Rushdie. He was right to see that situation as a matter, not of religious &#39;tolerance,&#39; but of resistance to clerical-governmental authority, and quite right to see continuity between various cynical appropriations of Islam for political purposes...just as he called out (for decades) the dangerous politicization of Christianity, even in the case of George W. Bush, whose wars he supported but about whom he also said this (from the recent New Yorker profile):</p>

<blockquote>Hitchens asks his opponents this: “We should have left Iraq the way it was? However I replay the tape, however much I wish things had been done differently, I can’t get to that position.” He acknowledged that his support of the war had caused him some intellectual discomfort. “The most difficult thing is having to defend an Administration that isn’t defensible,” he said. On television and radio, he explained, “you’re invited on to defend the Administration’s view on something and then someone’s invited on to attack it. You don’t want to begin by putting distance, because then it looks like you’re covering your ass. You take the confrontation as it actually is. I’m not going to spend a few silky minutes saying, ‘You know, I don’t really like Bush and his attitude toward stem cells.’ No. Wait. The motion before the house is this: Is this a just and necessary war or is it not?”

<p>He went on, “I’m open to the prosecution of the Administration, even the impeachment of some members, for the way they’ve fucked up the war, and also the way they exploit it domestically. But do not run away with the idea that my telling you this would satisfy any of my critics...&quot;</blockquote></p>

<p>Part of why &#39;wrong about it all&#39; pisses me off is that if anything he was fanatical about being right about it all <em>regardless of whether that made him the &#39;wrong&#39; kind of person, or yielded the wrong kind of &#39;friends.&#39;</em></p>

<p>He made the same basic point about 9/11 -- that Al Qaeda et al.&#39;s beef with the US is with its coastal cosmopolitan secularist modern society, not with its more Bush-supportive demographics -- that DFW made in &#39;The View from [whoever&#39;s house].&#39; But Hitchens wasn&#39;t pathologically (and <em>performatively</em>) self-doubting like DFW, and was a hell of a lot more obsessed with masculinity and destiny and all that other shit I can&#39;t get behind even though I can&#39;t quite escape its shadow either. So he was able to follow a <em>principled</em> throughline: the fastest way to end a war is to win it, and if war exists between openly state-supported would-be theocrats and the very idea of secular liberal democracy, then it&#39;s time to break out the Theocratic Enemies List and try to minimize civilian casualties.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the man insisted upon his own accountability and took solidarity goddamn seriously -- and he was able to see warmaking as a way of acting in solidarity, even when those wars were ordered by vile bastards whom Hitchens had previously attacked.</p>

<p>Well: if that means being wrong about policy/implementation and right about principle, I suppose there are worse things. And he tried to be right about both -- which led him to break his association with former friends and collaborators on the Left who go so hung up on the former than the latter became muddled.</p>

<p>He was right about the threat that theocracy poses to modernity, and the damage that modern living does as well. That seems like not so small a thing.</p></span>

<p>And you are right that he viewed himself as always adhering to a rigorously singular line of reasoning; this was the most odious part of his schtick. The man couldn&#39;t admit that in four decades of political awareness, some of his ideas had changed.</p>

<p>I also think it&#39;s weird to call an essayist and <i>bon vivant</i> an activist.</p></span>

<p>I wasn&#39;t just talking about his Iraq War support, though Hitchens&#39; fans need to either explain how it&#39;s consistent with his being a decent person, how most people have inconsistent views, or how he was somehow deranged and different at that point (and for the subsequent decade, which is a long time to plead temporary insanity) than during the rest of his career. I haven&#39;t seen any of those cases made convincingly. </p>

<p>He was an eloquent voice. Except when he was an unfair, vicious character assassin. He was a writer with a drinking problem, or a drunk with a writing habit, not an activist in any meaningful way. </p></span>

<p>Yes. This has nothing whatsoever to do with my comment, as I don&#39;t have any great interest in his atheist polemics. I do, on the other hand, have great interest in the twinned facts that (1) his atheism and his anticlerical/antitheocratic fury draw from the same well, yet (2) liberals very happy to split hairs about the difference in tolerability between cynical cod-Islamisms in order to justify their <em>a priori</em> antiwar stance are happy as clams waving Hitchens&#39;s sometimes broad-brush antireligious tracts about.</p>

<p>My point is that Hitchens&#39;s post-9/11 Middle East political views took shape within a decades-long debate within the Left about the possibility of secular liberal democratic modernity coexisting with fundamentalist antimodern theocracy (and gangsters like Saddam Hussein, who -- it should be noted -- happily sorted his subjects for butchery/patronage according to too-familiar tribal/religious criteria). Reading his older articles and columns is swell.</p>

<p>The last line of (if memory serves) Hitchens&#39;s first big post-Iraq-invasion article was &#39;What if it works?&#39; I don&#39;t think his thinking on the war and the Left can be understood without asking why so few of his supposedly in-solidarity-with-the-downtrodden comrades and friends were willing to ask the same question.</p>

<p>@Martin Wisse --</p>

<p><em>What good work? He slagged off Mother Theresa, but what did he do for the poor in India?</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you <em>have</em> to read/review even just selections from 40 years of justly-famous journalistic work and political activism before saying shit like that, but...</p></span>

Those who are familiar with [Stephen Hunter] will understand, and those who are not–well, what are you doing reading a book review by me when there is writing out there carved by a master? The man carves his books? A little Old Testament for my taste, but to each his own. “Soft Target” is the new Hunter thriller that takes place in a thriller writer’s fantasy land: America, the Mall. Appropriately, it combines the two things America loves the most: shopping and violence. If I wrote that the author of this review would number me among the terrorists. That said, the fact that he puts quotation marks around the title can only mean he aspires to write for the New Yorker, which is fortuitous given his obvious hatred of America. (He doesn't even mention Jesus among America's favorite things, which means he's obviously at war with Christmas.) Ray Cruz is Hunter’s new John Wayne ... The novel fleshes out so many characters and tells the story in such a thorough way that Tarantino would be jealous. The best advice about what books to read comes from people who only watch movies. Hunter’s greatest gift is his style, his prose. He’s been called the “populist Faulkner” and for good reason. I have no idea what that means. Perhaps the sentences that follow that one will illuminate. He’s no Vince Flynn and he’s no Tom Clancy. His characters inhabit a harsh world that is unforgiving and follows no set code of good wins over evil. His characters inhabit a place called reality where Hunter’s simple yet delicate and violent prose comes alive. His heroes are not perfect and his villains are never black and white. Nothing about prose there. Maybe further on in the review? Hunter’s novels also appeal because of their visual style, and this one is no different ... He feeds us the exact images and verbs our inner beasts need to gobble up in order to be completely consumed by the story. Hunter has perfected the craft of the thriller by keeping his prose simple a la Hemingway and giving us the details other writers shy away from, all while providing these in the context of a visually striking world only a man who reviewed films for decades could give us. This book is like a movie! You should watch it in your brain! It's like Hemingway only also Faulknerian! They were both writers I am name-dropping!</span></a></div>

Point being, a number of you have written asking why I haven't been blogging more frequently, and the short answer is that I haven't really had a computer for the past two months. I've got a laptop that can't open documents and was birthday gifted a Kindle which, also, can't open documents (much less display the visuals I need to do my work on, you know, visual rhetoric). So I'm going to take the patented Goldstein route of utter classnesses and ask for some help. If the university un-pays me as planned, I won't be able to afford a new computer for at least another few months. So if you'd like to see me back blogging sooner — that is, if you value what I write and want to read more of it — chip in and help my legs find some feet to stand on. I'm already headless, after all.
