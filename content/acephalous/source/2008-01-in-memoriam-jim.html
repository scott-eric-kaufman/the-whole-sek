		<span id="comment-99575226-content"><p>Jim Zwick was a scholar of the early years of the US Empire.  He researched the efforts of the great Mark Twain in promoting the mass-based American Anti-Imperialist League.  He was a good friend to my family and a friend of the Philippines.  Three things we surely miss in the US: Jim Zwick, Mark Twain and a popular anti-imperialist movement. Jim&#39;s example of combining scholarship with anti-imperialism should motivate us all.

As a World War 2 veteran and now an anti-war activist I appreciate his articles depicting the days when U.S. imperialism took root after defeating Spain and taking over their colonies. Needless to say, we have been at war ever since somewhere in Asia.</p></span>

<p>I was hoping someone might direct me to where I could access his many 3D pictures.  I use to peruse them for many hours at a time.  I hope his work has been carried on by someone somewhere.  My email is twobytwoarts@gmail.com if anyone has any information.</p>

Evolution and domestic policy and foreign affairs and hyper-masculinity and race-pride and refined blood and imperialism and American exceptionalism all colliding in one impenetrable interrogative! If I could unpack it succinctly with conviction I'd be long done.</span></a></div>

Were Obama elected President, he would the second person of African-American descent to occupy the highest office of a land.* The first would be this guy: Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt's great-grandfather was John Hood, &quot;an elegant vagabond with fine manners, a real dandy with a golden bracelet and a distinguished, stately appearance&quot; ... and an African-American. Seems Obama's &quot;historic&quot; campaign is not as historic as we were led to believe. Were he elected President, he would not be the first African-American Head of State, merely the first American African-American Head of State. (The first African-American American Head of State? Doesn't matter, Obama's still not special.) *Or the seventh, depending on who you ask.</span></a></div>
