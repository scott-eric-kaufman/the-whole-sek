			<p>As a science, psychoanalysis is dead.&nbsp; It does not model cognition, nor does it account for individual or group behaviors it has no hand in creating.&nbsp; (About&nbsp; which, more tomorrow.)&nbsp; You can't read Timothy D. Wilson's egregiously judicious <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674013824/diesekoschmar-20">Strangers to Ourselves</a> </em>and come to any other conclusion.&nbsp; All the bulwarks Norman Holland built to prevent its obsolescence have failed.&nbsp; <em>Spectacularly</em>.&nbsp; Unlike <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1593761015/diesekoschmar-20">Frederick Crews</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0631234136/diesekoschmar-20">Ernest Gellner</a>, Wilson &quot;attacks&quot; psychoanalysis by recognizing its importance to the field of psychology and citing it accordingly.&nbsp; (<em>Vicious</em>, he is.)&nbsp; While that move may not appear spectacular on its face, it's crucial to undermining the special disciplinary status psychoanalysis acquired by evolving <em>alongside</em> psychology.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Fancying themselves scientists, psychologists distanced themselves from psychoanalysis, which they considered <em>Homo neanderthalensis</em> to their <em>Homo sapiens</em>.&nbsp; With <em>H. neanderthalensis </em>evolving alongside them, they could point and laugh at its crudities but they couldn't deny its existence.&nbsp; There it was, matching their pace, refusing to wither under the derisive hail of <em>H. sapiens</em>.&nbsp; Because Wilson apportions psychoanalysis its proper place in the history of psychology—accepting his discipline's unscientific origins instead of shying away—he can christen psychoanalysis <em>Homo habilis </em>and be done with it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>He can afford it the same respect granted all other progenitors: a necessary, but from the present perspective, unsophisticated version of the current model.&nbsp; Just as we outstrip our &quot;handy&quot; forefathers, so too does contemporary psychology outstrip psychoanalysis.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I realize how strange that argument sounds, what with evolutionary psychology and its reductive models garnering more attention than their cognitive counterparts.&nbsp; That impression owes more to the inflated rhetoric <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/blink.html">I discussed yesterday</a> than the current state of the field.&nbsp; Given the evidence Wilson marshals, the discipline cares more about how the brain <em>works</em> than how it <em>evolved</em>, thus relegating those objectionable just-so stories to the status of window-dressing on the mansion currently under construction.&nbsp; &nbsp;(While it may be <em>best-selling</em> window-dressing, no one in the profession mistakes it for it a structural element.) </p>

<p>The genius of Wilson's decision becomes obvious when defenders of psychoanalysis argue for its contemporary currency.&nbsp; Like Norman Holland.&nbsp; Holland, in <a href="http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/journal/2004_holland08.shtml">an essay</a> someone assured would accurately present &quot;<a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/same_senseless_ramblings_slightly_bigger_stage_or_intellectual_investments/#1515">the actual scientific status of psychoanalysis</a>,&quot; moves through a series of arguments which Wilson's method renders moot.&nbsp; (Although, in citing patient responses to Rorschach blots, it teeters on the verge of being <em>hilariously </em>moot.)&nbsp; Why?</p>

<p>Because all of the psychoanalytic categories which still have purchase do so at the expense of their interpretive uniqueness.&nbsp; Contemporary cognitive science still believes that &quot;much mental life, including thoughts, feelings, and motives is unconscious,&quot; but they now have empirical evidence for doing so.&nbsp; Moreover, the evidence gathered shares neither characteristics nor origins with its psychoanalytic correlate—unless by &quot;origins&quot; you mean the equally generic &quot;stable personality patterns form in childhood and shape later relationships.&quot;&nbsp; By acknowledging its place in the genealogy of cognitive science, Wilson diffuses debate over whether it constitutes a viable alternative to it.&nbsp; It does ... to the same extent alchemy constitutes a viable alternative to chemistry.&nbsp; Its assumptions have not been <em>invalidated</em>, however, merely <em>refined.</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;In light of <em>evidence</em>.&nbsp; (Just as Freud imagined it would be.)<br /> </p>

<p>I could detail the paucity of that &quot;equivalent&quot; position, demonstrate how the antagonistic, interdependent elements of the psychoanalytic unconscious bear little resemblance to the oblivious, independent elements of the &quot;adaptive&quot; or &quot;cognitive&quot; unconscious.&nbsp; I could point out how ludicrous is the idea that <em>the </em>unconscious is structured like a language, or how that particular Lacanian notion relies on a naïve overestimation of the importance of language and narrative to the unconscious <em>and </em>conscious mind.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But then what would I write about tomorrow?&nbsp; </p>

<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; I know the promised &quot;fascinating studies&quot; have failed to materialize for the second night running.&nbsp; Consider these last two posts the groundwork for the critique to come.&nbsp; I need to demonstrate how Wilson's critique of psychoanalysis avoids the traps Crews and Gellner's charge headlong into, if only to diffuse the &quot;If not psychoanalysis, then what?&quot; responses which follow in any criticism's wake.</p>

		<span id="comment-19801050-content"><p>See this I don&#39;t mind.  Prove away -- shoot Freudian psychology dead.  Just make sure you aim for the heart and not the extremities: it&#39;s disgusting to leave it their whimpering.  That&#39;s what I dislike about Crews (from what I&#39;ve read): he shows so much contempt for the edifice he&#39;s debunking (be it Theory or Psychoanalysis or the Theory of Psychoanalysis) that one can&#39;t help but think he has a personal interest in doing so.  I don&#39;t like the self-righteousness and anger surrounding contemporary debates, because it makes me angry, and when I get angry, I don&#39;t think clearly.  But if you want to go ahead like Wittgenstein and give a point by sub-point by sub-sub-point analysis that thoroughly destroys Freud or who have you, do it!  Only then I&#39;ll know what each of Freud&#39;s premises are and why they&#39;re wrong!  Then the only matter left is to see whether we&#39;ve generated a thorough list of refuted premises or whether some have gone missing -- and to find the remainder, that&#39;s a philosophical task.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-19804586-content"><p>Since these posts are thematically connected by their consideration of psychoanalysis, I&#39;ll respond to the different posts and comments here, as best I can. </p>

<p>Scott, I was startled to read that Gladwell&#39;s model is agreeable to you, despite its lack of documentation and complexity. In a sense, this answers my earlier question about your theory of mind: you are following the cognitive debates, and are impressed with descriptions of an &quot;adaptive&quot; unconscious.</p>

<p>I consider the &quot;adaptive&quot; unconscious to be an extremely productive revision of Freud, and, for the most part, I am not tempted to re-assert Freud against these more recent findings. </p>

<p>I think the most productive statements we can make about Freud&#39;s scientific work read something like this: &quot;We now know that some of Freud&#39;s narratives about infantile experience posit impossible acts of remembering on the part of an immature infant brain. Freud may have been applying useful insights about adult traumatic experiences inappropriately; we also know that extremely significant moments in a person&#39;s life are more deeply integrated into their perceptual systems thanks to the greater-than-usual release of specific memory-related neurotransmitters. (This is why people who smoke pot suffer short-term memory loss; pot triggers an overload of these &quot;marker&quot; chemicals in the brain.) Thus one traumatic moment <i>can</i> have greater impact than two months of relative calm.&quot;</p>

<p>This also applies to the idea that the unconscious is structured like a language. We now know that sensory information is not processed exclusively &quot;bottom-up,&quot; meaning empirically according to the raw data received. It is also processed &quot;top-down,&quot; such that our preconceived ideas actually <i>change what we see</i>. Propositions about the world which have proven adaptive (or which are introduced under hypnosis, as in a recent study) are used to filter experience before it is consciously processed. This is not the same as an entire unconscious &quot;language,&quot; but it does explain where that psychoanalytic exaggeration might have started.</p>

<p> Gladwell&#39;s book retains the sort of psychological apparatus necessary to justify interpreting works of fiction in detail, because it describes associations as propositions. Thus, the combination of African-American man, dark street, and &quot;reaching inside the jacket&quot; produced, in the Diallo case, the misleadingly simple proposition &quot;armed and dangerous.&quot; We are therefore correct in our intuition that for Zola, all the parts of Nana&#39;s person, including details like her clothing, are a coordinated set of associations that mean &quot;courtesan.&quot; </p>

<p>Gladwell&#39;s book succeeds at presenting new cognitive insights; however, it is also an unscrupulous book. I don&#39;t mean that it is unscrupulous because Gladwell is lazy about citing sources; I mean that it is unscrupulous because it seduces readers with a vision of decisiveness. Gladwell&#39;s subjects are always experts with a 2% failure rate, instead of obsessives who wash their hands 50 times daily. His fundamental point is that, in situations with which we have sufficient past experience,  we should rely on our &quot;adaptive unconscious&quot; rather than succumbing to wasteful and harmful deliberation. </p>

<p>Had Freud studied relationship therapists, instead of Dr. Schreiber, I think he might have come to a similar conclusion. He might have announced that the unconscious was &quot;adaptive&quot; rather than a cesspool of drives. I deliberately referenced the study on marijuana and memory to set up the point that our brains are not as empirical as we might like, precisely because they have to filter and rank experience; thus obsession and post-traumatic stress syndrome. The question &quot;are you too nervous to thin-slice?&quot; should also entail the question &quot;are you consistently selecting the <i>wrong</i> salient details because of the way you have filtered and hierarchized past experiences?&quot;</p>

<p>This raises a larger problem: most of Gladwell&#39;s examples concern people who are <i>good at their jobs.</i> Thus the tennis coach, the counselor, the teacher, the art appraiser, etc. Not surprisingly, Gladwell shares with Levitt and Dubner a capitalistic love of intelligence and expertise, the prerequisites of success.</p>

<p>The kind of ethical work I&#39;ve been getting at in my posts is not related to efficiency on the job. Instead, it concerns the extremely inefficient task of overcoming the countless forms of madness which may never even interfere with a comfortable life: things like egotism, cognitive dissonance, ennui, compulsion, paranoia, and so on. This is madness as it appears in &quot;The Rape of the Lock,&quot; not the madness of a person having uncontrollable seizures. I&#39;m talking about the kind of analysis that produces a figure like Socrates, not the kind that accurately predicts the viability of a tennis serve.</p>

<p>I agree that very few works of criticism work through the disorders they identify. I also agree that literary critics are not in a position to run prisons and asylums simply because they&#39;ve read &quot;Dora: A Case History.&quot; However, I do believe that a democratic society ought to foster the belief that each individual can attain the highest degree of ethical responsibility and understanding. Gladwell&#39;s meritocracy of &quot;experts&quot; refers his readers to their own differentiated areas of expertise, while I hear Jacob Marley in the back of my mind, exclaiming to Scrooge that <i>mankind</i> was his business. I feel the same recoil that you felt when the Lacanians listed everything you&#39;d have to read before you would have the right to open <i>Ecrits</i>.</p>

<p>The pluralistic kind of &quot;therapy&quot; I proposed in my last comment would be highly sympathetic to William James. I say this because in the <i>Varieties of Religious Experience</i> James argues that different sorts of religious systems produce the same results when taken up by people of different temperaments. The same probity, for a cheerful person, is nourished by an Emersonian worldview, that for another (one of the born-agains he calls &quot;twice-born&quot;) is a Lutheran struggle against darkness. (Note: It happens that James also gives an account of religious conversion which overlaps with the Freudian unconscious.)</p>

<p>This, finally, raises the issue of the historical context of works of literature and scientific inquiry. I very much like the idea of contextualizing James and Freud; I also like the idea of contextualizing Gladwell and cognitive science. I can picture Marilyn Monroe&#39;s face. But it&#39;s like Andy Warhol tried to show us: what if that&#39;s all I can picture? </p></span>

		<span id="comment-19814342-content"><p>Alex, <i>there will be no remainders</i>.  (Outside of what I leave behind.)</p>

<p>Certainly, Adam, but I&#39;m increasingly convinced the problem with psychoanalysis isn&#39;t inherent, at least not philosophically, but in the purview of the claims made.  That should become more clear in the next couple of days, as I move away from Crews.</p>

<p>Go <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/on_the_power_of.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> to read what was below.</p>

<p><strike>forgottenboy, your version of my opinion of Gladwell sounds too sanguine.  The man is a phenomenal writer—his keen narrative instincts are the reason his work is as widely considered as it is—but he do little more than point an academic to certain, hotly contested debates.  The Wilson is a narratively inferior book, but because his narratives moves through disciplinary history case-study-by-case-study, it&#39;s easy to find the articles he cites and evaluate his assessment of them <i>and</i> the debates in which they intervene.  (In <i>Blink</i>, those debates are obscured by the litany of experts he interviews, none of whom think it&#39;s a bad idea to present radical positions as if they were the disciplinary norm.)  So far, I&#39;ve found Wilson to be a serial under-exaggerator (even in reference to his own work), so delicate not to trip any bullshit detectors that he compels readers to connect the dots he lines up.  The most salient of which—to show my hand, since I may post pure silliness later—is the possibility that a person can acquire a Freudian or Lacanian unconscious by sheer force of belief.  Not an actual one, mind you, since it would still reside &quot;above&quot; the adaptive unconscious; and not a truly &quot;unconscious&quot; unconscious, since it would be the product of conscious deliberation; but it could be there.  </p>

<p>In chapter four, he delves into the research into constitution of &quot;personality,&quot; and presents the consensus opinion that people&#39;s conscious beliefs and unconscious behavior are at odds.  He cites numerous studies which demonstrate, for example, that when a person and all her friends are asked to rate her on character traits like &quot;conscientiousness&quot; and &quot;temper,&quot; there is almost <i>no</i> correlation between the person&#39;s self-evaluation and her friends&#39; evaluations; however, there&#39;s a significant correlation, damn near a consensus, among her friends.  What this speaks to, Wilson argues, is the fact that the adaptive unconscious manifests its &quot;personality&quot; more forcefully in social situations, in moments when reactions are instant, or almost so, and thus rely not on conscious deliberation but on the unconscious modules.  Their contours are clearly visible to everyone <i>except</i> the person who must infer the disposition of implicit processes they can only access indirectly.  We can&#39;t control those processes despite the fact that they constitute the bulk of our personality.  We are what we do, not how we rationalize it.  (On its face, this is a familiar model.  Keep in mind, however, that the processes involved work in no way like their psychoanalytic counterparts.  No family romance and all it entails.)</p>

<p>How does Wilson know this?  Like anyone interested in human cognition, he studies people with unique and/or extensive brain damage.  He cites the Gazzaniga and LeDoux&#39;s famous study of the lobotomized patient whose right hemisphere (controlling the left side of his body) is flashed a picture of a snow scene on it and asked to pick the card which corresponds to it: a shovel, a can opener, a screwdriver and a saw.  With his left hand he picks the shovel every time; with his left-hemisphere controlled right hand, he did no better than chance.  Then they flashed different pictures at the same time:</p>

<blockquote>[I]n one trial they flashed the snow scene to [the patient&#39;s] right hemisphere and a picture of a chicken claw to his left hemisphere.  Hepicked the card with a shovel with his left hand (because that was the one most related to the snow scene seen by his right hemisphere) and a card with a chicken with his right hand (because that was most related to the chicken claw seen by his left hemisphere.

<p>The researchers then asked [the patient] why had picked the cards he did.  Like most people, [the patient&#39;s] speech center was n his left hemisphere, which knew why he had picked the chicken with his right hand (because he had seen the chicken claw) but had no idea why he had picked the shovel with his left hand (because the snow scene was viewed only by the right hemisphere).  No problem; the left hemipshere quickly made up an answer: &quot;I saw a claw and picked a chicken, and you have to clean out the chicken shed with a shovel. (96)</blockquote></p>

<p>A basic example of &quot;mind-blindness,&quot; I know, but a powerful indication of what the deliberative consciousness constantly does; namely, it confabulates rational—typically <i>narrative</i>—explanations when confronted with <i>any</i> situation.  It acts <i>as if</i> it possesses all the facts, understands all the motives, and produces an plausible explanation.  The superficial resemblance to psychoanalytic theory reappears, but in this case, the distinction is definitive: there is no repression involved, no psychic defense mechanism at work here; the conscious mind is merely as ignorant of these unconscious modules as the distribution of liver enzymes.  Our tiny, perhaps even epiphenomenal, conscious mind lies because that is all it knows how to do.  </p>

<p>I prefer the modified &quot;executive model&quot; of consciousness.  In the unmodified version, the legislative and judicial branches and the executive staffers work for—albeit not at the behest of—the President.  He issues directives, sets &quot;the course&quot; which everyone else follows.  Wilson, himself following Owen Flanagan, thinks the consciousness-as-President model grants it too much power; he prefers what Flanagan calls the consciousness-as-Reagan model, because</p>

<blockquote>Reagan was the entertaining and eloquent spokesperson for a cadre of smart and hardworking powers (actually layers of power), some known to outsiders, and some unknown.  This is not to deny that Reagan <i>felt</i> as if he were in charge in his role as &quot;The Great Communicator&quot; ... The point is that one can feel presidential, and indeed <i>be</i> presidential, but still be less in control than it seems from either the inside or outside. (7)</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, the narratives we use to rationalize our behavior are interdependent with the processes they obscure.  The stories we tell ourselves about ourselves can alter our disposition to our environment <i>and our reactions to it</i>.  Short of a neurological event, we are more plastic than the interminable cure would have us believe; we are so plastic, in fact, that we can create a working model a Freudian, Jungian, Kleinian, Lacanian, Zizekian &amp;c. &quot;unconscious&quot; where none previously existed.  We can alter our social situation such that we relate to people as our preferred psychoanalytic model predicts, which forces the adaptive unconscious to behave in accordance with the altered social environment.  We can slip a conscious psychoanalytic &quot;unconscious&quot; between our Inner Reagan and actual unconscious.  </p>

<p>What this means for the study of literature is that the <i>already</i> strong argument in favor of teasing psychoanalytic models from works authored by writers of the psychoanalytic persuasion contains <i>more explanatory power</i> than I initially apportioned it.  Even better—or worse, if you&#39;ve taken a hardline anti-psychoanalytic stance like <i>some people</i> I am—to the extent that psychoanalysis <i>is</i> literary theory, the superstructural relations it identifies are, if they appear with the frequency with which scholars claim, of extreme, perhaps central, importance.  There&#39;s a catch:</p>

<p>Advocacy criticism is fundamentally, perhaps fatally, flawed.  Any theory which considers fundamental a psychoanalytic account of human cognition finds itself with a literary trope in the place their theory of mind resided.  They have unwittingly confused a highly sophisticated, <i>literary</i> manifestation of deliberate thought for the basic workings of the human mind.  The mind is not a work of art, and cannot be treated as such.  I will track this line of thought further tomorrow, but I think you can see the general direction I&#39;m headed.</strike></p></span>

		<span id="comment-19815650-content"><p>Scott - It&#39;s early here, and I have a toddler and a Staffordshire competing for position on my lap, so this may not be the clearest question, but:  I am broadly sympathetic to many of the critical points you outline, but am concerned that, thus far in your critique, the knife doesn&#39;t seem to cut both ways - that you may not be  applying a similarly intense critical gaze to contemporary cognitive science.</p>

<p>To me, large-scale shifts in disposition - such as manifested in the current excitement about cognitive science - beg for historical explanations:  why is this happening *now*?  Why does it appeal so widely?  This is particularly the case for me when I feel the appeal personally - as I do, with cognitive science.</p>

<p>I am sure that something - probably many things - true are coming out of contemporary experiment and theory-formation in cognitive science.  But when we historicise other forms of thought such as psychoanalysis - trying to understand why psychoanalysis resonated with many people, even though we cannot now attribute that resonance to the &quot;truth&quot; of psychoanalytic theory -  this brings with a recognition that many of the forms of science that currently appeal to us may be similarly appealing-but-untrue - or appealing for reasons that are not related to truth-value.</p>

<p>I&#39;d feel more comfortable criticising psychoanalysis in the name of cognitive science if I felt I had a more solid historical grasp on the basis for cognitive science&#39;s own appeal.  Marx talks somewhere (can anyone remember where? I remember, but can never seem to find, this comment - perhaps it&#39;s a false memory...) about critiques that act as though &quot;there used to be history, but now there is none&quot; - critiques that speak as though we can look back and see all the superstitions of our ancestors, because we now know what is truly real.  </p>

<p>A more thorough-going historical critique would try to recognise at least some of the historical reasons we simply care about different truths now, or prioritise different concepts or forms of perception, and therefore find it considerably easier to find errors in earlier theories to which, for many historical reasons, we are now less committed...</p>

<p>If we don&#39;t do this, it&#39;s very easy to lose track of how underdetermined by the experimental evidence many contemporary approaches also are - and to lose sight of the torrent of historical sensibilities that drain into that gap between evidence and theory...  As you note, we&#39;re proven confabulators, capable of spinning a fine yarn only loosely anchored to experience, always wanting to find meaningful patterns and only occasionally stubling across an enduring one, etc.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean that the contemporary critique of psychoanalytic theory is incorrect - only that we should at least try to apply the same critical gaze to the current fetish...</p></span>

I have so much on my plate—so much which seems urgent—that I hardly know where to focus my attention. So I'll let someone else decide: Following Ray's links, I stumbled on Jonah Lehrer's lukewarm defense of Malcolm Gladwell's Blink. Unbeknownst to you, dear readers, I wrote a very similar account not only of Gladwell's book, but of all popular neuroscience, in which I declared sublime those &quot;meta-&quot; moments that only books about human consciousness provide. For example: Picture in your mind the face of Marilyn Monroe. Ready? You just used your fusiform gyrus. (219) Blows my mind every time. I love books that produce the physiological effects they describe in the act of describing them. Steven Pinker's explanations may be just-so stories, but the processes for which they account are solid science. When he says &quot;when Y, then X,&quot; you can be certain that when a guy confronts Y, his brain explodes with X—even if X didn't develop because a greater percentage of monkeys who could scuttle up trees one-handed in the rain survived than didn't. Now, thanks to Lehrer, I can trumpet Timothy D. Wilson's Strangers to Ourselves too, only without all the caveats Gladwell inspired. For one, the complaint about the dearth of footnotes evaporates. Wilson documents the studies he cites, and I've spent the past couple of hours browsing through those articles. I'm surprised by what I've found. More often than not, the claims the authors propound are far more radical than those Wilson attributes to them. He tones them down, renders them more palatable to the regnant orthodoxy. Which is odd. Most popular science writers inflate the importance of the research they cite in order to grab the reader's attention. (Norman Holland and Steven Pinker spring to mind.) Why does Wilson take the opposite tack? I'm not sure. It may be constitutional. Anyone who can &quot;teach the conflicts&quot;—that is the first non-paywalled link I could find—the way Wilson can possesses the rare talent for fairness in the face of vicious intellectual bluster. He presents all arguments—the psychoanalytic included—in their strongest forms and that, apparently, entails deflating the work of contemporary cognitive science while inflating the importance of psychoanalytic &quot;findings.&quot; With the exception of Occam's Razor's appearance on page 79 —there is &quot;no need to introduce additional theoretical constructs&quot;—psychoanalysis seems a viable, if frequently problematic, alternative to contemporary cognitive theory. (Which, of course, merely validates the &quot;scientific&quot; quality of Freud's intuitions. Not that Wilson...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/untitled_thomas.html"><span><strong>Untitled Thomas Pynchon</strong> This information shot across my radar a few weeks back, but I didn’t believe it until today.* You can now pre-order your very own Untitled Thomas Pynchon (Hardback). I’m not sure what to make of Amazon’s description (or its purported source): Spanning the period between the Chicago World’s Fair of 1893 and the years just after World War I, this novel moves from the labor troubles in Colorado to turn-of-the-century New York, to London and Gottingen, Venice and Vienna, the Balkans, Central Asia, Siberia at the time of the mysterious Tunguska Event, Mexico during the Revolution, postwar Paris, silent-era Hollywood, and one or two places not strictly speaking on the map at all. With a worldwide disaster looming just a few years ahead, it is a time of unrestrained corporate greed, false religiosity, moronic fecklessness, and evil intent in high places. No reference to the present day is intended or should be inferred. The sizable cast of characters includes anarchists, balloonists, gamblers, corporate tycoons, drug enthusiasts, innocents and decadents, mathematicians, mad scientists, shamans, psychics, and stage magicians, spies, detectives, adventuresses, and hired guns. There are cameo appearances by Nikola Tesla, Bela Lugosi, and Groucho Marx. As an era of certainty comes crashing down around their ears and an unpredictable future commences, these folks are mostly just trying to pursue their lives. Sometimes they manage to catch up; sometimes it’s their lives that pursue them. Meanwhile, the author is up to his usual business. Characters stop what they’re doing to sing what are for the most part stupid songs. Strange sexual practices take place. Obscure languages are spoken, not always idiomatically. Contrary-to-the-fact occurrences occur. If it is not the world, it is what the world might be with a minor adjustment or two. According to some, this is one of the main purposes of fiction. Let the reader decide, let the reader beware. Good luck. *I was burned by Time in 1997. Some fool wrote a feature about the publication of Mason &amp; Dixon, The Gospel According to the Son, and the “forthcoming” Salinger novel.</span></a></div>
