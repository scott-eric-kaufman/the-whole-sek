			<p>Although linked to <a href="http://pasaudela.blogspot.com/2005/10/asses-are-made-to-bear-and-so-are-you.html">elsewhere</a>, I think the wife would be proud to see it here.&nbsp; Thus, I present to you <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/lmergner/112821224316388749/#57851">my moment in DaDa's sun</a>:</p><blockquote><p>
	no No NO, I was talking about Gangesa, the 14th century Sanskrit philosopher of logic, not Shree <em>Ganesha</em>,
elephant-headed son of Shiva and Parvati. However, given Ganesha's
association with intellect and wit and the erudite howlers Gangesa

<em>right there!</em>&nbsp; On <em>that table!</em>&nbsp; Shree-tapping-dancing-Ganesha!</p></blockquote>
		</div>
					<a id="more"></a>
			<div class="entry-more">
				<p>At this point, a complaint about the quality of conversation at <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/">The Valve</a> arose.&nbsp; I defended my adopted child as best I could:</p>
<blockquote><p>As for the Valve, being that I'm a contributer there, I must say that I
disagree completely with Matt's assessment of it being a &quot;bad blog.&quot;
It's no worse than <a href="http://www.long-sunday.net/">Long Sunday</a>, only ideologically different. For some
reason I seem to be the only one who genuinely likes people who
contribute to both...except for that [PR], about whom my
feelings are well-document (in <a href="http://lmergner.blogspot.com/2005/10/full-disclosure.html">this very post</a>, no less). I can't see
why everyone can't get along, outside of the fact that <em>everyone seems to argue in bad faith</em>.&nbsp; I don't know why they do this, but they do.</p>

<p>
On
the other hand (and this comment's getting damn long, as have a lot of
mine lately), there's also the eternal divide between the scholar and
the critic, with the Valve people falling on the scholarly side and
Long Sunday on the critical...but that's not really accurate, what with
Holbo being an analytic philosopher by training; and we all appreciate
the same music; seem to like the same books (non-theory division);
watch the same movies. We'd be drinking buddies in an off-line
life...and yet look at us.</p></blockquote><p>
But <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/unpave_parking_lot_put_up_a_paradise/#4360">The Mad Thinker</a> foiled my plans:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ah. Scott I see wastes no time in twisting my words. When I said &quot;bad
blog&quot; I was speaking in the sort of stern voice one uses when
addressing a dog who has just inhaled one's fillet mignon, after you
have spent a lifetime researching and cooking it to perfection. In fact
I have actually seen this happen once, in a kitchen of a fancy
restuarant in which I labored, late at night, and let me tell you the
cold hard truth of the matter is: They do no appreciate an $18 piece of
meat. Not on the way down, at least. For a good hour afterwards,
however, this particular dog did indeed seem quite content with
himself. But it was the kind of contentment that comes half from
shit-eating grin and half from dread, at perhaps anticipating the
largest, most difficult and yet most satisfying shit of your entire
life. After which, of course, walking around and interacting with
people became once again the joy it always was. </p>

<p>
You'll
notice, Scott, that then by implication all blogs (and let's include
blog comments) are in some sense being scolded for being &quot;bad,&quot;
including my own. </p>

<p>
I must conclude that your failure to detect
this tone of voice immediately is yet again more evidence of your utter
theoretical incoherence. By &quot;theory,&quot; needless to say, I mean
everything that is derived neither from philosophical Europe nor those
misguided Americans who write about Europeans, nor from anything in
literary or cultural theory after 1960.*</p>

<p>
That said, The Valve is
a very bad Value erm, Valve, creaky and trill and smug and probably to
be avoided like the great plague of 1776. Long Sunday, meanwhile, is
&quot;ideologically&quot; different insofar as it chooses not to make its living
by pissing on people, but rather by attempting to extend to them the
maximum charity possible, in order to learn what may be learned and
only then &quot;move on.&quot; Long Sunday is the bucket, dipped into the well.
Indeed, one wonders if the Valve were to its druthers, the well
wouldn't promptly be drained dry and some corporation given a lucrative
contract to rebuild it &quot;a bit closer&quot; to the ivory tower.</p>

<p>
Except
for Scott, of course. He is the mighty exception that has yet to prove
the rule. But he cross-posts everything anyway, as does Daniel Green.
Furthermore, if their inqueditor in chief decides to begin blogrolling
pas au-delà, then dogs, let it be said, shall n'er again do wrong. I
have named my price, and it hath no concern for dignity. Bob Dylan's a
hypocrit with that song, after all.</p>
</blockquote><p>
I responded with powerful nonsense!</p>
<blockquote><p>Matt, I did no such thing! With your typical theoretical sophistry you
claim that &quot;bad blog&quot; encompasses to all blogs, yet the referent for
&quot;blog&quot; in your statement is obviously the Valve, given that it was the
only blog referenced in the previous sentence. This is the sort of bad
faith argument I've come to expect from you, Mark, er, Matt, er, <em>whichever idiot you are</em>.&nbsp; You people with your theories and your propensity for backing, no, wiggling, <em>NAY!</em>
chickening out of every debate with a &quot;You haven't read everything he's
written&quot;-here and a &quot;He's not nearly so stupid in the books he isn't a
total fuckin' idiot in like the one you 'happened' accidentally to
read&quot;-there. Oh, I'm on to your games, Mart, er, Mack, whatever your
friggin' name is. You can try to distract me with talk of steaks, but
HA! you didn't know I was a vegetarian! Or at least that I was until
very recently, when, having beaten [a small case of sniffles], I
reevaluated my lifestyle and decided to reincorporate fish and fowl
into it. HA! You didn't know that. And I had a point here, but you and
your stupid stupidity ruined it. On another note entirely, you should
read this:&nbsp; </p>

&nbsp; </a></p>

<p>
That's my first-of-a-two-part-series of responses to Mark's
question about my take on Foucault. As I mention, I think it'd be
hilarious to post it on the Valve and Long Sunday. Because I'm one of
you guys, now. Just ask CR:</p>

[<em>This comment brought to you by the letters E, X, H, A, U, S, T, I, S, S, T, I, O, N.</em>]</p>
</blockquote><p>
But my efforts were in vain!</p><blockquote><p>
	Well done, Scott, and I do mean all the Scotts.</p>

<p>I might also
note that when you state, &quot;This comment brought to you by the letters
E,X,H,A,U,S,T,I,S,S,T,I,O,N you speled exhausticism wrong (or is it
wong? I always did have trouble with that one). Anyway, insofar as I
read one article precisely because I was attracted to its badness after
hearing from people who know that it was bad, in order that I might
later claim it to be &quot;symptomatic&quot; of an entire taste culture
(something about which I know somethings or three, I'll have you know),
and yet you only read ten books (and ten other books by each of the
thinkers whose arguments the thinker in question is undoubtedly
thinking *with*) and yet I AM AN INTERNETS CELEBRITY and ACADEMIC
PULLER OF WEIGHT so I could really just, you know, care less.</p>

<p>Carry on!&nbsp; Oh when I was seven, I skinned my knee.&nbsp; Take that!</p>

<p>Which
is all just to say, quite simply, that if you email me your post I'll
be happy to &quot;cross-post&quot; it, as they say, and we'll see whose rightness
is the greatest rightness of which no greater rightness can be thunk.
(Do bear in mind, however, the many expressions that the gesture of
complete and utter silence may or may not! contain, but that only we
apostles shall ever know.) Enuph!</p></blockquote><p>I tried to respond, but</p><blockquote><p><em>The Decline</em> officially sucks. I wrote like, um, 59,389 words
after that, and how many show up? Do you expect me to repeat it all?
Anyway, all I said (in condensed form) was 1) Luke, I'll respond to
your comments on my blog a.s.a.p., i.e. whenever I'm finished with
Foucault, and Matt, well, you know you got yours comin' to you. So, um,
expect it!</p></blockquote><p>I should have known that</p><blockquote><p>It's hopeless Kaufman, they're on my side.</p></blockquote><p>This is not ... the greatest thread in the world, no ... <a href="http://www.rhetbear.com/MUSIC/tenaciousd.htm">this is just a tribute</a>.</p>

That means the same post now appears below, on the Valve and on Londay Sunday. (Well, almost the same post, since I tweaked it between the time I posted it here and sent it to Matt, and have tweaked the version on the Valve a few times since.) This is no Brucian scheme to drive more traffic my way, however. (What do I care for anonymous traffic when all you lovely people are already here?) I'm interested in watching how the same ideas are considered in two different forums. (I resisted the urge to pluralize fancifully.) And in creating peace between our two peoples. As CR noted in the amusing comic-book-cum-indie-rock thread last Monday: I appreciated yr initial comment, Scott. And I’ll take it further in the hokeyness line… There’s actually a bond between those that blog… Those that take this seriously… A bond deeper than the differences that divide us on the “matters fundamental.” I think, anyway. The very fact that we’re here. That we care to discuss or even have it out. It’s the others, off-line, that are going through the motions… Ever talk blog to outsiders? Meet with that blank stare? “But why? Why do you feel the need to do that?” And it seems so obvious to those of us in this bidness of torching each other, daily… Like a restoration of something that should’ve been going on all along... His account jives with my experience: blank stares or unsubtle hints of time wasted. I've also received a fair amount of genuine inquiry. One of my dissertation advisors, for example, pulled me aside after a lecture series he'd organized to ask me about both Acephalous and the Valve. He had read over them and was intrigued by their potential as a scholarly venue. Another faculty member (contra Bruce and Tribble) said that in his discussions about my blog with other faculty members, they had all noted that if they knew a candidate had a blog on which he or she discussed matters academic, the first two things they would think are: 1) this candidate is a committed writer, which bodes well for his or her academic career, and 2) this writer thinks about academia when he or she isn't required to, and would therefore be far less likely to coast once he or she acquired tenure. Dangers certainly abound. (Some have already been hysterically catalogued by people with no insight into the hiring process.) But many of them can be avoided if only we could stop behaving like we're on the internet and start acting more like Adam Roberts. (Yes, this post received vital compositional assistance from an over-the-counter cold remedy. Can't you tell? Look at all the parentheses.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/who_can_write_i.html"><span><strong>Who Can Write in Your Books? Anyone Important Enough To</strong> [Warning: This post may seem livejournalistic. But entertainingly so. You know me better than to think my tales of life at UCI merely personal. They all resonate. Resonate, I say, RESONATE! That, and there's some implicit lessons to be learned on the importance of bibliophile etiquette buried deep beneath the surface of this entry.] Before I begin working through Foucault to the New Historicists, I have some trivia to share. The copy of Hardt and Negri's Empire from which I'll be quoting has an interesting history. It begins in 2000, the year of its initial publication, when Jim Ziegler (since tenure-tracked somewhere) and I were discussing it in the &quot;TA lounge,&quot; a.k.a. the round table in front of the graduate student mailboxes ... which the faculty use as a short-cut between the main English department office and the primary graduate seminar room. (And why shouldn't they? It's their department.) So Jim and I are idly chatting about Empire when Julia Lupton walks up, pauses, greets us, says something to Jim (I'm deaf, remember?) and then hurries off. (Julia's an important person around UCI—a model academic whose standards I fail daily to live up to—she's always hurrying somewhere, and with good reason.) Point being: Julia and Jim exchange words both assumed I could hear. I couldn't, but as I often do in such situations, I nodded my head and pretended to hear all. So when Jim's email arrived later that afternoon asking me what times worked best for me, I had no clue what he was talking about. I related my schedule. &quot;Perfect,&quot; he responded. &quot;I'll get right on it.&quot; &quot;Get right on it?&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;Get right on what?&quot; Turns out everyone rightly pegged Jim as (but mistook me for) the resident Hardt &amp; Negri expert, and that I was now the co-coordinator of the faculty-dominated Empire reading group. You heard me correctly: a first year, in his second quarter, was assumed expert enough in the Hardt &amp; Negri corpus to lead a faculty-dominated reading group. (In retrospect I realize the faith Julia placed in Jim was well-founded, and her willingness to defer to a graduate student on the topic a sign that she practiced the egalitarianism she preached. But I digress.) So I participated in this reading group with Jim, Julia and a host of imposing faculty members like Mark Poster and Andrzej Warminski. One of the highlights of my first year, I tell you. Time passes. The year is 2005. It is Spring Quarter. I haven't thought about Empire or been all that theoretically inclined for years. I still own the book, mind you, and it still overbrims with my original marginalia. I'm invested in every page. Manic glossing. Attack this point here, cheer-lead that point there. The phone rings. &quot;Hello?&quot; I say, assuming the voice at the other end belongs to a machine which desires nothing more than to clean my carpet, lower my mortgage rates or help me refinance my loans. &quot;Yes, I'm told...</span></a></div>
