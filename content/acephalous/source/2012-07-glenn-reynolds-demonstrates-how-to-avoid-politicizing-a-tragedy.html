        <meta name="description" content="As everyone who pays attention to political blogging knows, tragedies are too tragic to politicize. Discussing gun control in the wake of a tragic shooting is despicable political opportunism. Discussing the discussion of gun control in the wake of a tragic shooting, however, isn’t politically opportunistic because it’s a morally neutral, second-order discussion about a discussion. It’s a meta-discussion about the propriety of having a political discussion in the wake of a tragic shooting, meaning it’s an apolitical discussion whose participants are immune to the charge that they’re violating decorum by politicizing a tragedy. For example, here’s Glenn Reynolds’s first post about Aurora: A TRULY AWFUL mass shooting in Denver. At the Batman premiere. UPDATE: More here. It doesn’t exploit the tragedy by using it to score cheap political points, so no one could accuse him of political opportunism. But here’s his second post on the tragic shooting: POLITICAL OPPORTUNISM: CNN’s Piers Morgan, First to Use Colorado Tragedy to Assault Second Amendment Rights. I’m sure he won’t be the last. Others may blame Hollywood. In both cases, it’s a mix of opportunism and a desire not to confront the existence of evil. Well, okay, in Piers Morgan’s case, it’s not much of a mix, really. UPDATE: Left Blames Aurora Shooting On Rush Limbaugh. Of course they do. Hey, never let a tragedy go to waste, when you might use it to smear an opponent. Every time something like this happens, they roll out the blood libels. Because conservative bloggers have established that it’s not political opportunism to discuss political opportunism, this technically doesn’t qualify as an exploitation of the tragic shooting, because pointing out other people’s political opportunism isn’t politically opportunistic—even though the people doing the pointing are ideologically opposed to the people they’re pointing at. Every conservative blogger knows that. Reynold’s next post qualifies as non-opportunistic for the same reason: FIRST, ABC NEWS CONNECTS THE COLORADO SHOOTING WITH THE TEA PARTY, now Brian Ross says oops, sorry about that. Reaction: “Brian Ross must be fired by the end of the day.” What’s pathetic is that every time, they so clearly want to blame tragedies like this on the Tea Party. I don’t generally like these calls for firings, and Ross was no doubt just reading what a producer sent him, but . . . They know how to be exquisitely sensitive and non-prejudgey when it might be a Muslim or some other protected minority, so maybe the only way to encourage them to show better judgment the rest of the time is to cost some people their jobs. Who was the producer? Meanwhile, I look forward to the libel suit. . . . UPDATE: ABC News goes into “Damage Control Mode.” ANOTHER UPDATE: Jim Treacher on Twitter: “It’s not even about @BrianRoss. It’s about a subculture with a view of the world in which @BrianRoss’s assumption there is only natural.” MORE: Here’s an interview with the man ABC News libeled.

<p>STILL MORE:  Prof. Stephen Clark writes:  “Yes, but ‘subculture’    suggests a smaller group than it actually is.   The condescension   implicit in these repeated attempts by the likes of Ross is widely   shared.  And though observed frequently, these acts highlight one of the   great cultural divides yet to be fully examined.  Academics like Haidt   have only scratched the surface by shining a light on the divide.”</p>

My   terms:  Groveling apology to be repeated on at least two national   newscasts, plus <em>This Week</em> and all Colorado affiliates.  Plus   $250K in damages.  No apology by tonight, and the demand goes to $5   million.  Oh, and guys, be sure to preserve all records, browser   histories, etc. for litigation. . . .</p>
<p>And <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/07/20/brian-ross-standards/">Brian Ross’s track record</a> might support an argument that it’s reckless to have him on the air at all . . .</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brian Ross’ appalling error linking the Tea Party  movement to the  suspected Batman-movie shooter in Colorado demonstrates  anew how slow  journalists can be in grasping an elementary lesson of  disaster  coverage: Resist temptation to report more than you can  immediately  verify.</p>
<p>In the hours just after a disaster, journalists tend to be especially   prone to error and imprecision, as Ross, the chief investigative   correspondents for ABC News, amply demonstrated in declaring today on   Good Morning America:</p>
<p>“There is a Jim Holmes of Aurora, Colorado, page on the Tea Party   site as well, talking about him joining the Tea Party last year.</p>
<p>“Now, we don’t know if this is the same Jim Holmes,” Ross added, “but it is a Jim Holmes of Aurora, Colo.”</p>
<p>The suspect arrested in the shootings early today at a movie theater   in Aurora, Colorado, is named James Holmes. But he is not the “Jim   Holmes” to whom Ross referred, and the suspected killer has no known   connections to the grassroots Tea Party movement, which advocates   restraints in government spending. . . .  Whatever the reason, his error   on a television program that attracts 4.5 million viewers was   inexcusable — and eminently preventable.</p>
<p>In the swirling uncertainty that invariably marks the hours after a   disaster, journalists are well-served to show deliberation and   restraint, to be mindful that error and distortion often blight the   first reports of dramatic events.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus, the emptiness of ABC’s apology.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>At this point it’s been twenty four hours since Glenn Reynolds  learned about the tragic shooting. During those twenty four hours, he  wrote fourteen posts and thirteen updates about the tragic shooting.  Despite the fact that thirteen of the posts and twelve of the updates  concern Brian Ross’s remarks about the Tea Party, Glenn Reynolds  believes that none of those thirteen posts or twelve updates exploit the  tragic shooting because he’s only discussing the discussion, not the  tragedy itself. That warrants repeating:</p>
<p>Even though Glenn Reynolds writes <em>thirteen posts</em> and <em>twelve updates </em>about  Brian Ross in the twenty four hours following the tragic shooting, he  believes he is not being politically opportunistic because he’s  discussing the discussion, not the tragedy itself. This is because Glenn  Reynolds is using Brian Ross’s remarks about the Tea Party, not the  tragic shooting itself, to further a campaign to have Brian Ross fired  for his remarks about the Tea Party. This is <em>not</em> political  opportunism, even if it’s meant to prevent political opponents of the  Tea Party from saying anything about guns or gun control in the hours  after a tragic shooting, because Glenn Reynolds is discussing the  discussion, not the tragedy itself.</p>
<p>Only—<em>no</em>. The evidence above speaks for itself. Glenn  Reynolds clearly exploited Brian Ross’s remarks about the Tea Party as a  means of forwarding his anti-gun control position. His belief—shared by  many conservative bloggers—that second-order  exploitations of a tragedy don’t qualify as exploitative is simply  wrong. So too is his belief—again shared by many conservative  bloggers—that one oppositional political remark about a tragedy grants  them license to write endlessly about that remark without having to  worry about appearing politically opportunistic. Any statement made in  the furtherance of a political agenda qualifies as a a political  statement, and given both the content and volume of Reynolds’ posts and  updates in the wake of the tragic shooting, it’s fair to say that not  only has Reynolds politicized this tragedy, he’s done so in a manner  that deserves scorn.</p>
<p>He should be embarrassed by his response to this tragedy, not because  it’s political—politicizing a tragedy isn’t inherently despicable—but  because of the breathlessness of the exploitation. He clearly <em>enjoys</em> having the opportunity to exploit a tragedy to further his political  agenda, because he believes himself shielded against moral scolds by his  sophistic insistence that discussing a discussion isn’t political. It  is. What makes him despicable isn’t his incorrect belief that he’s  operating apolitically so much as the self-satisfied smirk on his face  when he claims he is.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Has any man ever been so <a href="http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/147156/">doggedly commited</a> to the cause of self-satire?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS OF <a href="http://legalinsurrection.com/2012/07/remembering-chicagos-victims/">this month’s massacre in Chicago.</a> “A mass murder like Aurora, Colorado, naturally grabs the headlines   and attention, as it should.  A presidential recognition of the murders   is appropriate.  Yet more than twice as many people have been murdered   this month in the president’s hometown of Chicago than were killed in   the Aurora shooting.  They are just statistics for whom there will be no   presidential visits or flags flown at half staff.”</p>
<p>Well, since Chicago already has very strict gun control, these deaths can’t be turned to political use.</p>

<p>No, I think not.</p>

Work for you? Of course not. As to Obama: If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business, you didn’t build that. Antecedents can co-refer across sentence boundaries in English. They just can. (See what I did there?) Moreover, the nearest potential antecedent to a pronoun isn't necessarily the actual antecedent. Consider: The monkey took the banana and ate it. The monkey became sick after it ate the banana. In both cases &quot;the banana&quot; is closer to &quot;it&quot; than &quot;the monkey&quot; is, but in the first sentence &quot;it&quot; refers to &quot;the banana,&quot; whereas in the second sentence &quot;it&quot; refers to &quot;the monkey.&quot; This isn't that difficult people. The &quot;this&quot; in the previous sentence? It doesn't even have a referent. It refers back to the situation of entire text. Now it's doing so over three sentence. It can do it over four. It can do so to infinity if I so choose. That's just how it works. In short: Neither inclusion in the same sentence nor proximity to a pronoun is definitive proof that Obama's &quot;that&quot; refers to &quot;business,&quot; and context makes a strong case that Obama's &quot;that&quot; referred across more than one sentence to a catalog of antecedents including &quot;somebody,&quot; &quot;a great teacher,&quot; another &quot;somebody,&quot; the &quot;American system,&quot; yet another &quot;somebody,&quot; and &quot;roads and bridges.&quot; &quot;That&quot; refers to all that in the same way the second &quot;that&quot; in this sentence does. Simple as that. As to Ann Romney: the phrase &quot;you people&quot; only works as an epithet when it's directed at someone. If I write that I'm going to tell you people about &quot;you people,&quot; none of you people will be offended because I wasn't trying to diminish you people by calling you &quot;you people.&quot; If Mitt Romney had said &quot;you people&quot; during his speech to the NAACP, that'd be a different story. But Ann Romney was being interviewed on ABC News, meaning &quot;you people&quot; clearly refers to the mainstream media so beloved by conservatives everywhere. Which means she might have been using it as an epithet targeted at the mainstream media establishment. All of which is only to say: I've now devoted the last half hour of my life to writing about &quot;that&quot; and &quot;you people,&quot; and I hope that you people enjoy it, because I never want to do so again.</span></a></div>
