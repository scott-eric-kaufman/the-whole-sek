Vance and I have been back-channeling about Watchmen this past week. It occurs to me that there's no sense in wasting my brilliant thoughts on an audience of one (!?!) when I could be sharing them with all the world. Vance agreed. Our first quibble concerns the look of Dave Gibbon's panels. Vance insists the panels looked dated. He's not wrong. But before we discuss some of his limitations, we should attend to Gibbons' strength: layout. Consider these panels again: Gibbons purposely centers the first panel on nothing in order to force the reader to search for the photograph. Your eyes gravitate to the center. Nothing there. So you move them to the portion of the panel which contains actual information: up and to the right. Gibbons draws your attention into the center panel. The strong version of this argument would be that he accomplishes this by aligning the photograph such that your eye is drawn from the center of the panel, through the photograph, then to the text at the top of the center panel like so: The weak version would claim that Gibbons does this through color. The display itself almost functions like a purple arrow (minus the stalk) pointing at the predominantly purple center panel. The blue of Manhattan's jacket would then perform a similar bridging function from the second panel to the third. Note that he also disconnects Manhattan from himself. By centering the center panel on her and the right panel on him, Gibbons puts space (literally) between the man in the picture and the god on Mars. The repetition of the smooth line of Manhattan's right shoulder in both panels makes it seem as if the image skips because someone removed a few frames from the reel. In an issue in which nostalgia is achieved by moving through time and re- or pre-living an event (from the perspective of the narrative present), this slight technical success unobtrusively reinforces the larger theme. You likely noticed the weak and strong versions of my argument can (and do) coexist. Each of the three elements of the text (script, composition, color) augment the other two. Such synergy is rare (and likely a function of Moore's notoriously precise scripts), and in terms of the visual style of the book, sets Watchmen far above its peers. Put differently: Watchmen looks dated in the same way (and for the same reason) a Caravaggio like this one does: it fails to meet the photorealistic standards of a future era. We praise Caravaggio for his sense of composition and use of color. We should extend the same sympathy to Gibbons.

(171)<br /></div><br />Considering how unique the palatte of <em>Watchmen </em>is—the creative team deliberately shunned the bold color combinations the hand separators were accustomed to creating—that the book contains as much synergistic detail as it does represents quite the technical achievement.&#0160; This feels like the natural place to end this post.&#0160; So I will.&#0160; <br /><br />My next post will cover particular matters of style in the sixth issue.&#0160; <br /></div></div>

		<span id="comment-148929447-content"><p>Hmm, interesting. I think we&#39;re pretty far apart on this. Photorealism, for instance, is IMO a red herring: as you know (Bob), the degree of realism has not simply increased monotonically over the history of art. (And an Ingres is highly realistic in one sense, but not another; and a Sargent is realistic in a third sense, but not in a fourth. Etc.) Similarly, I&#39;m unsympathetic to the argument from technical limitation. I don&#39;t think Krazy Kat used fancier means.</p>

<p>With &quot;dated&quot;, I didn&#39;t just mean that the images are recognizably of a particular era. In that sense, all art is dated: when we say something is timeless, ahead of its time, etc., we&#39;re speaking figuratively. The particular knock I&#39;m trying to make on Gibbons&#39; work here is that it seems <i>constrained</i> by a too-familiar technical repertoire. Here, look at the woman&#39;s face in the second panel -- the hair, the eyes, the lips. This is all by the book, literally: when I was a boy, I checked out books from the library that promised to teach you these tricks. Gibbons is proficient, no question, but to scan these lines is not to see freshly.</p>

<p>Moore&#39;s text, by comparison, works with conventions, some very hokey, and has fun with them -- puts them in perspective, ironizes them (to effect, not just reflexively). I&#39;m sure there are good examples of this in comic-book art; the easiest existence proof from my highbrow perspective is Lichtenstein. (Or Guston.)</p>

<p>More, no doubt, on further digestion.</p></span>

<p>Tangentially -- with Caravaggio, more even than composition and color, I think we admire the use of light and shadow, and the theatrical effect of space.

I&#39;ve never read such in-depth writing on the subject, and I imagine Sim is the only person who cares about it as much as Sim does. Not the only topic of which that could be said. Still: extraordinary.</p></span>

Read something like this: You only post about comic books and films because you're incapable of writing about Real Literature. That you post obsessively about cultural detritus is proof that you're unconsciously aware of your inadequacy and are compensating. But no number of close-readings of mediocre popular fare will convince you or prove to anyone else that you have the chops to analyze Real Literature. You would never slather such attention on a poem because it is beyond your meager skill. I wouldn't? Pwned. Double-pwned. Triple-pwned. Quadruple-pwned. WORD-FOR-FIVE-pwned. I feel better now.</span></a></div>

Then Shahar excerpted a different part of the article and I changed my mind: A recent study by researchers at the University of California, Irvine, found that a third of students surveyed said that they expected B’s just for attending lectures, and 40 percent said they deserved a B for completing the required reading. Did that prepositional phrase modify the researchers (they are at UCI) or where they did their study (at UCI)? I couldn’t tell from the excerpt. So I read the article. It didn’t say. So I read the study it cited. It didn’t say outright—but it hinted. The ethnic diversity of its sample breaks down like this: 51.2% East or Southeast Asian 18.9% Caucasian 10.7% Latino 1.1% African American The ethnic diversity of a closely related fine public university in a similar location breaks down like this: 51% Asian / Pacific Islander 24% White 12% Latino 2% African American Participants in the study were recruited through handbills “posted at the Social Sciences Human Subjects Laboratory.” Where do I teach? This means that while everyone else can speak hypothetically about whether their students resemble those in the study, I must come to terms with the fact that sixty-percent of actual students actually sitting in my actual classes believe that if they “explain to [me] that [they are] trying hard, [they] think [I] should give [them] some consideration with respect to [their] course grade.” I must accept that fifty-percent of them believe that they deserve a B if they “have completed most [of the mandatory] reading for [my] class” or “have attended most [of the mandatory] classes for [my] course.” I must deal with the fact that twenty-five percent of them “would think poorly of [me if I] didn’t respond the same day to an e-mail [they] sent.” I could learn to deal with that. But I’m not sure I can live in a world in which sixteen-percent of my students think that I “should not be annoyed with [them] if [they] receive an important call during class.” (x-posted.)</span></a></div>
