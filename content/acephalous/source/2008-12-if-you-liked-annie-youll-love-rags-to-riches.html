There are, of course, novels written by Horatio Alger, but even they only qualify on a technicality. (Plus, not all of Alger's novels rely on pluck and luck to drive the narrative.) Not that his novels weren't enormously popular, as over 17,000,000 million copies were sold in the 1860s through 1880s. Nor was their uplifting ideology incidental, as the popularity of C. B. Seymour's Self-Made Man (1858) and Freeman Hunt's Lives of American Merchants (1858) attest.

Maybe there are, but most encounters with the phrase &quot;Horatio Alger novels&quot; are purely contrary. We have the first fifteen chapters of every Jack London novel. We have Robert Penn Warren calling Theodore Dreiser's The Financier an attempt to modernize the Horatio Alger myth (Homage 56). We have Richard Wright identifying it as the locus classicus of capitalist mystification in Black Boy: I dreamed of going north and writing books, novels. The North symbolized to me all that I had not felt and seen; it had no relation whatever to what actually existed. Yet, by imagining a place where everything was possible, I kept hope alive in me. But where had I got this notion of doing something in the future, of going away from home and accomplishing something that would be recognized by others?

Whither the tradition they counter? Wright's autobiography and Bellow's autobiographical novel clearly respond to the narrative form of Alger's novels, but that brings us back to Alger as the only author proper to his category. I'm tempted to say that this is yet another case of savvy critics trying to account for the popularity of atrocious novels by appealing to a grand ideology that predisposed a given audience to swallow shallow tripe—but then my student, the one who humbled me this afternoon, wouldn't know the names of any earnest iterations of the Horatio Alger narrative.

		<span id="comment-142165310-content"><p>I always thought that &quot;Horatio Alger story&quot; referred mainly to real-life tales spun in the Alger vein.  I never thought there was a long tradition of writers who followed in footsteps of Alger, in part because it&#39;s so obvious that the backlash followed close upon the heels of Alger&#39;s popularity.</p>

<p>Still, the rags to riches narrative predates Alger by, uh, 1000s of years.  &quot;Cinderella&quot; is among the most popular, *Les Miserables* among the most interesting, Moses the most Jewish (&quot;My son, he&#39;s a prophet.  How&#39;s yours?&quot;), Sir Gareth and Robin Hood the most medieval, Ben Franklin&#39;s autobiography the most autobiographical, Abe Lincoln&#39;s biography the most biographical (and one written by Alger himself).  Jesus&#39;s story isn&#39;t bad either.</p>

<p>And then there are the neo-Alger novels, which aren&#39;t quite backlashes but rather more like meditations and complications of: *Gatsby*, or Doctorow&#39;s *Billy Bathgate*, or *The Godfather*.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to me how the ideology shifts, though.  The &quot;self-made man&quot; trope might be more modern, more an effect of Romanticism.  Jean Valjean recreates himself, but he can never leave the taint of his crime behind him.  Frankenstein cannot make a man without reintroducing sin into his world.  It&#39;s a sort of post-Romantic, progressive optimism that allows for self-fashioning without the classical opposition between reality and artifice, or the Christian idea of original sin or marks of Cain, or even the Romantic terrible sublimity of human creation.  The Alger ideology is one in which you leave the past behind for good when you become good.  Protestantism without anything dangerous.</p>

<p>But overall, the idea here is metalepsis: after Alger, they are all called &quot;Alger stories,&quot; even if they predate Alger.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-142206778-content"><p>I feel uncomfortable following Luther here, what with my general lack of literary or Americanist knowledge, but I stumble blindy forward!</p>

<p>I would think that you&#39;re looking in the wrong areas on two fronts.  First, wasn&#39;t most of Alger&#39;s literary production in the last four decades of the 19th century?  As Luther notes, both ascent and descent stories predate Alger (and I would think Melville&#39;s &quot;Bartleby&quot; would be an anti-Alger narrative from the 1850s), but if there were other writers working the Alger narrative market I would look for them contemporaneously.  Second, Alger was working in the field of juvenile literature.  So I would think that &quot;novels&quot; would be the wrong place to look for such similarly straightforward narratives of uplift.</p>

<p>My former colleague <a href="http://www.unco.edu/history/bl.html" rel="nofollow">Brian Luskey</a> would probably know the answer, as he&#39;s working on a social and cultural history of clerks in 19th century northeastern US cities and, though a historian, looks at literary and other cultural representations.</p></span>

<p>Benjamin Franklin<br />
Frederick Douglass<br />
Booker T. Washington</p>

<p>If there aren&#39;t many &quot;Horatio Alger novels&quot; in American lit., the story of an individual&#39;s success through hard work is the basic template for most classic autobiographical narratives.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-143064162-content"><p>There&#39;s a good number of &quot;self-made men&quot; in SF, of course... I was kind of thinking that might be the last stronghold of that character archetype, actually, outside of biographies and autobiographies. Rand, Heinlein, but also Stephen Baxter&#39;s Manifold series and other more recent books/series feature a &quot;self-made man.&quot; (And then this dovetails with biomodification and you get literally self-made men (or, er, &quot;people&quot;) like the asexes and the guy with the artificial DNA in Greg Egan&#39;s <i>Distress</i>. </p>

<p>Not so much, the rags-to-riches, though I have seen it from time to time in short stories... especially unpublished ones. (Maybe that&#39;s saying something.) </p></span>
