Its author, the self-styled &quot;Cowboy,&quot; claims &quot;absolute moral authority,&quot; because he's an English professor. I have my doubts, as might you after you read his riff on Jeff Foxworthy's &quot;You might be a redneck if...&quot; routine: You might be an English Department professor if... Before I get started, who says &quot;English Department professor&quot;? None of the &quot;English Department professors&quot; I know would call themselves or their fellows that. It's the equivalent of a &quot;knowledgeable&quot; baseball fan complaining about opposing teams &quot;sacrifice walking&quot; Barry Bonds. Cowboy's unfamiliarity with the lingo gives up the game from the start. But humor him, as he's about to humor us: You might be an English Department professor if... You think Marx was reasonable— Your last article was on the literary value of a grocery list— You believe Moby Dick isn't worth reading— But that the Porky's movies are culturally revealing— Your superpower is the ability to make students hate great literature— You think Sylvia Plath is anything other than just sad— You hate, and I mean really hate, Ted Hughes but can't name one of his poems. You think the culture wars are over ... and you won. You think a rifle is the same as a shotgun. You can look in the mirror and say any of these without cracking up: &quot;Visual rhetoric.&quot; &quot;Cultural studies.&quot; &quot;Technological literacy.&quot; &quot;Gender studies.&quot; &quot;Queer studies.&quot; &quot;I am a specialist in post-Imperialist Jamaican Feminist and Transgendered Literature.&quot; &quot;I am qualified to teach undergraduate survey course to your undergraduate English Majors.&quot; I'm hard pressed to find a decent entry into this mess of stupidity, so I'll start with the obvious: the Porky's movies are culturally revealing, in that they reveal something about the culture which produced them. A work need not be artistic to be culturally revealing. Consider the popularity of the equally (if differently) odious Left Behind series. It's no more literary than Porky's, but it's certainly culturally revealing, given that its popularity accompanied (or pushed, or was driven by) a swell of evangelicalism.

Like &quot;but shrug ant farm,&quot; the phrase is inherently funny. Only, what's so funny about that? Granted, Foxworthy's shtick is inherently unfunny. I only think this because I'm an elitist, obviously. I don't know from low humor. I'm all like &quot;if it lacks the pathos of the Sad Clown, it will win no chuckles from me.&quot; Still, assuming there's a universe in which the likes of Jay Leno are funny, &quot;cultural studies&quot; isn't a funny punchline. I spent ten minutes looking in the mirror saying it, and not only was it not funny, it got progressively unfunnier before teetering into absurdity as I stood there saying &quot;Chet.
