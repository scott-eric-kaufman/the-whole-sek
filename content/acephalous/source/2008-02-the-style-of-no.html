<p>That said, you&#39;re right about one thing: this post assumes a much greater familiarity with Dick than I originally thought.  Thing is, I laughed out loud when I read that, because it seemed so perfectly paced, its comma splice so delectably disjunctive (or something, <em>yadda yadda yadda</em>, as I&#39;m not good with descriptive prose).</p></span>

<p>&quot;Barefoot conducts his seminars on his houseboat in Sausalito. It costs a hundred dollars to find out why we are on this Earth. You also get a sandwich, but I wasn&#39;t hungry that day. John Lennon had just been killed and I think I know why we are on this Earth; it&#39;s to find out that what you love the most will be taken away from you, probably due to an error in high places rather than by design.&quot;</p>

		<span id="comment-105339856-content"><p>Arguing over the quality of PKD&#39;s sentences has become the &quot;Is Heinlein&#39;s <i>Starship Troopers</i> fascist&quot; for the literary SF set.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really think that I&#39;ve read enough Delany to engage him -- he&#39;s the most well-known SF critic of PKD&#39;s sentences.  I can suspect that Delany&#39;s desire for a literary gloss is why those SF books of his that I&#39;ve read are more boring than they need to be, but I haven&#39;t really read Delany&#39;s critical work in detail.  </p>

<p>But compare, say, a typical PKD work and Delany&#39;s <i>Dhalgren</i>.  It isn&#39;t simply that PKD is trying for a pulp rush with his sentences.  It&#39;s that PKD has lower-to-middle-class characters groping their way through a fractured world in fractured prose.  In <i>Dhalgren</i>, the world is incomprehensible, and the derelict city is composed mostly of thrill-seekers, but you constantly have to struggle past the level of the writing to assimilate that.  As a result, the strongest images in <i>Dhalgren</i> are essentially static set-pieces -- I&#39;ll think of three at random: the Kid looks down at the commune leader&#39;s girlfriend and sees that he&#39;s scratched her leg in the same way as the woman&#39;s leg was scratched who turned into a tree; the Kid is running along thinking Dhalgren over and over and as the repetitions run together you realize it&#39;s Grendel; the Kid is looking at the body at the bottom of the elevator shaft and wondering how to get it out.  Those are strong images, sure, or I wouldn&#39;t remember them years after reading the book.  But if PKD had written like that, he wouldn&#39;t be remembered.  There&#39;s a huge mass of Dhalgren about violence and group sex and the use of poetry for status that should be interesting, but when you layer a sort of mannered smoothness over it at the writing level, it&#39;s dull.<br />

<p>Nah. The only Dick I&#39;ve read is the Dick quoted here and in other places by the sorts of people who quote Dick (e.g., Lethem), and I guessed Dick as soon as I read &quot;I&#39;m currently re-reading one of this author&#39;s later novels and am inclined to agree.  There&#39;s a lurching quality to his mostly competent, sometimes execrable, occasionally brilliant prose.&quot; Okay, first I thought, &quot;Joyce,&quot; and then I thought, SEK wouldn&#39;t be talking about Joyce in this way.</p>

<p>Basically, it&#39;s just a matter of being familiar with the favored writers of a particular reader community.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-105406942-content"><p>That paradigmatic shift, as Barthes would call it, is exactly how Delany illuminates the differences in form, as opposed to content, that define science fiction as a genre.  The problem is that these effects are too easy: &quot;The cat roamed the nighttime street, turning its third head into the streetlamp&#39;s shadow.&quot;  That Delany himself is not a very good writer should not afford us the freedom to elevate PKD much higher.  I stand by the old chestnut that PKD (and Delany) are better at invention than execution.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been thinking that the true sign of great literature is power of imagination.  By that, I mean not that a great artist imagines brave, new worlds filled with lygers and tigons; rather, that the artist has fully imagined the world, has thrown us into it, such that what is on the page is the fullest, most rhythmic and forceful vision of that world.  Kerouac once wrote a set of rules for improvised writing.  The best rule was to keep a complete image of the object of one&#39;s improvisation in one&#39;s mind at all times.  The great jazz artist, no matter how out, knows the melody frontwards and backwards, has it on his mind always, so that every deviation is a suggestion.  Joyce&#39;s Dublin is such a case, as even the characters&#39; footsteps echo  forth the shape of a city, as is the Rome of Shakespeare&#39;s *Julius Caesar* or the feudal Scotland of *MacBeth*.  The Porter at Hell&#39;s Gate tells us all we need to know about Shakespeare&#39;s world.  </p>

<p>PKD and Delany give me that sense of thrown-ness, but while Delany gets too caught up in tone-deaf pseudo-theorizing, PKD too often sounds like he&#39;s making it up as he goes along.  The initial conceits are gripping, the characters are, as Rich points out, brilliant fumblers, but PKD doesn&#39;t seem to have fully imagined the worlds he constructs.  Kafka is the opposite.  He has so completely understood the ramifications of his image of the world that he realized that it must change the very shape of art: unfinishable, unrealizable, analysis interminable.  (As opposed to Beckett, who thematized this asymptotic nightmare of art but expressed it in a rather tight, formal structure.)</p></span>

<p>[CONTEXT: A space traveler with a TV screen implanted on her wrist fascinates the villagers on a backward planet] </p>

<p>&quot;The villagers were absolutely hypnotised by all these wonderful magic images flashing over her wrist.

		<span id="comment-105472164-content"><p><em>It&#39;s that PKD has lower-to-middle-class characters groping their way through a fractured world in fractured prose. In Dhalgren, the world is incomprehensible, and the derelict city is composed mostly of thrill-seekers, but you constantly have to struggle past the level of the writing to assimilate that.</em></p>

<p>In all honesty, I&#39;ve never finished a Delany book.  I tried to read <em>Dhalgren</em> eight or nine times -- <em>Dhalgren</em>&#39;s <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BkuovT0r7h4C&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=dhalgren+%22gravity's+rainbow%22&source=web&ots=E2G2nS2r_f&sig=qUjmSJXqeRootaNuyPt82NXcwzc&hl=en#PPA85,M1" rel="nofollow">better than <em>Gravity&#39;s Rainbow</em></a>, you know, because of sales -- but never got past the self-consciously literary language that, in the end, wasn&#39;t all that literary.  I applaud the effort, but wonder whether it isn&#39;t better <em>not</em> to aim high when you&#39;re bound to miss the mark. </p>

<p>One problem, I think, is that Delany&#39;s so damn knowledgeable about SF specifically and so damn articulate about literature generally that people cut him slack: &quot;I may not understand this book, but it <em>must</em> be brilliant.&quot;  Same with William Gass: y&#39;all know I love his essays, but <em>The Tunnel</em> was well-nigh unreadable.</p>

<p><em>It&#39;s that PKD has lower-to-middle-class characters groping their way through a fractured world in fractured prose.</em></p>

<p>That artistifyin&#39; his failures though, isn&#39;t?  That&#39;s what I aimed at with the Joyce comparison: PKD&#39;s no Joyce, in that his groping wasn&#39;t intentional, just gropey; but since most of PKD&#39;s readers have also read Joyce, they see in the deficit of technique echoes of modernist experimentation, which makes it seem all the more literary.</p>

<p><em>By that, I mean not that a great artist imagines brave, new worlds filled with lygers and tigons; rather, that the artist has fully imagined the world, has thrown us into it, such that what is on the page is the fullest, most rhythmic and forceful vision of that world.</em></p>

<p>If that world&#39;s fully realized, though, it&#39;ll be disjointed in its realization.  (Short of hundreds of pages of exposition, at least.)  Another way to put this: I love world-building novels, but I hate the majority of contemporary ones because every damn thing&#39;s explained.  At a certain level of detail, the realist impulse reveals the utter artifice of the world.  </p>

<p>To make this not about SF, we could look at Dreiser&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_Tragedy" rel="nofollow"><em>An American Tragedy</em></a>, whose walls lose solidity the more detail he invests in them.  I don&#39;t have my copy handy, but I remember long passages about peeling corners, an exhaustiveness that, instead of sharpening the image, flattened all the details.  When each detail is given the same weight -- when the narrative pays as much attention to the thin crack above the floorboard as it does the door, the jamb, and the wainscot -- the result is less photorealistic than surrealistic, like a Picasso with eyes the size of noses the size of hands.  </p>

<p>In terms of actual novels, compare Kim Stanley Robinson&#39;s <em>Gold Coast</em> series with any PKD books about OC/LA counties.  PKD&#39;s books contain all the absences we associate with contemporary literary realism -- we have no idea how this social order came to be, or why this corporation has monopolized this market, or why the streets are paved in this particular way.  In KSR&#39;s books, we have all that and it only makes them feel less realistic.</p></span>

The characters move through a space that comes to life as they move through it.  The world is in their thoughts, their demeanors, their clothes, and their smells.</p>

<p>The world building must be left inside the author&#39;s head, so that the action can begin in media res.  The reader must be thrown in, scrabbling to find a place from which to see the action.</p>

<p>This is the power of Shakespearean drama: complete worlds brought to live in the movement, gestures, and speech of the actors.</p></span>

<p>Does authorial intention really matter, as long as the effect works?</p>

<p>But if we&#39;re getting into intention, it&#39;s never been clear to me just how naive PKD was.  Yes, he wrote in a pulp genre, churning out poorly edited novels as fast as possible, while taking speed.  That can&#39;t help but affect the writing.  But it wasn&#39;t like he was devoid of literary thought about what he was trying to do.  For instance, his use of multiple narrative characters, he says somewhere, was a technique that he was adapting from one used in (Japanese?) novels (not sure if I remember that rightly, but Google is silent on it).  Since he started out writing realistic fiction, it&#39;s not like he was unfamiliar with modernist experimentation himself.</p>

<p>The &quot;PKD as naive artisan&quot; theory is best developed by a couple of short critical pieces by Stanislaw Lem, btw.</p></span>
