It took me a while: The resulting note wheel is as lovely as it is meaningless, because I remember absolutely nothing about The Damnation of Theron Ware. From my notes, I can almost reconstruct why I read it: Theron enjoys the &quot;primitive&quot; pleasures of Catholic picnics; contrast to earlier (235-6) image of it as orderly machine; no, from sociological &amp; intellectual perspective it's orderly, from internal is primitive If only I knew the antecedent of &quot;it&quot; I might be able to reconstruct my reason for reading the book. Am I the only one for whom the Five Year Rule applies? (And do I really want that question answered?) (x-posted.) *Notation borrowed from a letter Joyce wrote to his mother after arriving in Paris: &quot;Your order for 3s 4d of Tuesday last was very welcome as I had been without food for 42 hours (forty-two).&quot; How's that for passive-aggression?</span></a></div>

To wit: It follows, implausibly, that nobody (else) prior to SEK had any justified beliefs! Why would they have? In addition to previously mentioned qualms, I find three additional problems for SEK's position. You would. First, there is a striking disunity in the treatment of a priori and a posteriori justifiedness. Only the latter is coherentist in contour, and only the latter features a metajustification requirement. Keep telling yourself that. Second, SEK assumes that justifiedness arises purely from logical and probabilistic relations between propositions, ignoring the causal process of belief production. Whatever gets you through the day. Third, SEK is insensitive to issues of psychological realism. Am not! SEK fails to address the significant category of stored beliefs, or the extent to which stored belief contents are accessible. Did not! I totally addressed the extent to which stored belief contents were, you know, accessed by significant categories of themselves . . . and do you need me to tell you I don't actually take Ambien® and am not sure how I accomplished this impressive feat of publication when I was nine years old?</span></a></div>
