All this bubbling of sap and slipping of sheaths and bursting of calyxes was carried to her on mingled currents of fragrance.

On such an afternoon Charity Royall lay on a ridge above a sunlit
hollow, her face pressed to the earth and the warm currents of the grass
running through her. Directly in her line of vision a blackberry branch
laid its frail white flowers and blue-green leaves against the sky. Just
beyond, a tuft of sweet-fern uncurled between the beaded shoots of the
grass, and a small yellow butterfly vibrated over them like a fleck of
sunshine. This was all she saw; but she felt, above her and about her,
the strong growth of the beeches clothing the ridge, the rounding of
pale green cones on countless spruce-branches, the push of myriads of
sweet-fern fronds in the cracks of the stony slope below the wood,
and the crowding shoots of meadowsweet and yellow flags in the pasture
beyond. All this bubbling of sap and slipping of sheaths and bursting of
calyxes was carried to her on mingled currents of fragrance. Every leaf
and bud and blade seemed to contribute its exhalation to the pervading
sweetness in which the pungency of pine-sap prevailed over the spice
of thyme and the subtle perfume of fern, and all were merged in a moist
earth-smell that was like the breath of some huge sun-warmed animal.</p></blockquote><p>The whole paragraph turns on a semicolon: &quot;This was what she saw; but she felt ...&quot;&nbsp; The description of what she felt dramatizes the dilemma described above.&nbsp; Sight connects things gently, such as the &quot;blackberry branch&quot; and &quot;frail white flowers.&quot;&nbsp; When Wharton wants to emphasize the emotional interconnection Royall feels, she turns to heavy alliteration: &quot;this bubbling of sap and slipping of sheaths,&quot; &quot;the pungency of pine-sap prevailed,&quot; &amp;c.&nbsp; The assonance is usually accompanied by internal alliteration, as in &quot;the subtle perfume of fern&quot; and &quot;all were merged in a moist earth-smell.&quot;&nbsp; Is the effect of reading what Royall felt not stunningly seductive?&nbsp; Now imagine if it were pressed into argumentative service.&nbsp; Would it not be equally compelling if it could be controlled, deployed not dangerously often but rather for effect?*</p>

<p>*Please answer in the affirmative.&nbsp; Otherwise I might cry.</p>

<blockquote><br />
Studying the speech of hypomanic patients has revealed that they tend to rhyme and use other sound associations, such as alliteration, far more often than do unaffected individuals. They also use idiosyncratic words nearly three times as often as do control subjects. Moreover, in specific drills, they can list synonyms or form other word associations much more rapidly than is considered normal. It seems, then, that both the quantity and quality of thoughts build during hypomania. This speed increase may range from a very mild quickening to complete psychotic incoherence. It is not yet clear what causes this qualitative change in mental processing. Nevertheless, this altered cognitive state may well facilitate the formation of unique ideas and associations.</blockquote><br />

<p>If the alliteration is a useful tool for getting thoughts down on the page, use it.  You will edit it later anyway: will it slow you down more or less to deal with the alliteration in the iteration instead of up-front?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-74112552-content"><p>Prof. Dresner of course has it right, and anything I would add along those lines would another variation of the good advice our advisors give us, that we then struggle to take.  Instead I&#39;ll add a different, if perhaps overly obvious, observation: if alliteration works, you aren&#39;t going to notice it as such.  The alliteration in the Wharton piece is successful because it carries the reader along an imagistic stream.  One can go back and admire such use of language, but if it calls attention to itself, if you&#39;re busy noticing the prevailing pugency of the pine sap, then you&#39;re not really reading the next bit, and the power and effectiveness of such language is lost.  I don&#39;t think that this is substantially different in analytic or persuasive writing, though, given the more abstracted kind of signifiers likely to be used, there is perhaps more of a chance for the aesthetic qualities of writing to distracting rather than compelling.</p></span>

They'd be wrong.

It records a brilliant display of nonacademic muddling through narrative complexities. Granted, given that Milch was once a Milton scholar, you'd think him better able to articulate his way through these knots; but if you forgive him those peccadillos, you snob, you'll see his talent for narrative was abundantly evident way back in the dark days of 2001.) When David Milch announced the death of Deadwood, like most fans of the show, I took consolation in the fact that HBO had already greenlit another Milch production, John From Cincinnati. (As to the two Deadwood films purported to be in preproduction, I hold my breath.) Given that it would be on HBO, I knew I needn't fear any diminishment of Milch's signature style: HBO would allow him to let rain spectacular profanity. (The suits might even encourage it.) Understand, then, that I watched the first episode of John From Cincinnati in mild disbelief: not only do the characters not speak like foul-mouthed miners, one of them begins the episode unable to say anything except &quot;the end is near&quot; and &quot;some things I know and some things I don't.&quot; More on that in a moment. The most memorable dialogue emerges from the interaction of Luis Guzman's &quot;Ramon Gaviota,&quot; Willie Garson's &quot;Meyer Dickstein,&quot; and Matt Winston's &quot;Barry Cunningham.&quot; Their connection to the overall story is (currently) tenuous: they are the lottery-winner (Cunningham) who purchases a motel in which one of the main characters lives; the motel's former owner (Dickstein); and its once and future manager (Gaviota). Cunningham is convinced that something is amiss in Room 24. When he first arrives, he explains to Dickstein why he's packing heat: Cunningham: I am armed in accordance with the State Lottery Commission's pamphlet The Challenge of Sudden Wealth, which urges that winners be cautious in the conduct of their business affairs. Dickstein: Do you have another gun? Cunningham: I did not buy a backup, against the advice of Pete's Pistol Hut. I didn't contract Cunningham's words because the defining characteristic of his speak is a stiltedness meant to betray a deeper reserve of awkwardness. After the main characters suffer (and recover from) an accident, this trio decides to do something nice for his family. Cunningham insists that they close the door to Room 24 (which he had left open when he sprinted from it earlier). Bumping into each other as they approach the door: Cunningham: Do you hear the dead man singing within, gentlemen? Gaviota: I'm half deaf from the leaf blower. Cunningham: Attorney Dickstein? Dickstein: Surfer's ear. Exostosis of the ear canal. Cunningham: I alone, then, am favored by that jovially croaking, post-coital falsetto winsomely caricaturing Debby Boone? Who but Milch would think to pen such a line? Unlike Deadwood, the people who speak like this on John From Cincinnati are clearly unbalanced. There is, for example, Ed O'Neill's &quot;Bill Jacks,&quot; who at one point warns the room...</span></a></div>
