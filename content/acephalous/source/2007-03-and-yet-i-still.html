For example, you say you will talk to us about our grades but you really will not because of how uncomfortable you make me feel with your words and what you say.

I am a very religious man and you are not a bad person but you do not choose your words with enough care like a teacher should.

You criticize our writings because we are college students and young but do not realize that you offend most of us when you do this. I am always offended when I go to your class and have been on many occasions but I never tell you of my offense because you make me completely uncomfortable so I never say a word. You like to lead discussions and that is bad because it is the entire means by which we learn but we do not know what you want from us on our papers. I have honestly no idea what I learned from you in this class because so much time was spent discussing the tiny details in the passages in the book and so if I learned anything it is how to read things in too much detail. I could have read books in too much detail on my own but that is not what I came to college to do because I already know how to read and I would have told you this but you make me completely uncomfortable with your words so I never said a word.

			<p>A <em>slightly</em> redacted version of my favorite student complaint ever:</p><blockquote><p>My Teacher,</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I appreciate you taking your inconvenience to instruct us but I really had some problems in your class and I would like to explain them to you now.&nbsp; Every day I wanted to discuss with you about the way you grade my papers and the way you teach the class, but I could not because the things you say in class and your words disturb me so much I can not.&nbsp; You make me completely uncomfortable with the little things you say in the class like how you talk about television or how you talk about when you are grading our papers and trying to be fair.&nbsp; You do not seem to care about our grades only that they are up to your too high standards and I can not talk to you because you make me completely uncomfortable.&nbsp; For example, you say you will talk to us about our grades but you really will not because of how uncomfortable you make me feel with your words and what you say.</p>

<p>I will plan to contest the grade you have given me in this class when I get it because I know it will be much higher with any other teacher.&nbsp; I am a very religious man and you are not a bad person but you do not choose your words with enough care like a teacher should.&nbsp; You try to be objective and the very attempt becomes your flaw because you try so hard to grade fairly and comment wisely that you become biased to your own ideas.&nbsp; You criticize our writings because we are college students and young but do not realize that you offend most of us when you do this.&nbsp; I am always offended when I go to your class and have been on many occasions but I never tell you of my offense because you make me completely uncomfortable so I never say a word.</p>

<p>You like to lead discussions and that is bad because it is the entire means by which we learn but we do not know what you want from us on our papers.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have honestly no idea what I learned from you in this class because so much time was spent discussing the tiny details in the passages in the book and so if I learned anything it is how to read things in too much detail.&nbsp; I could have read books in too much detail on my own but that is not what I came to college to do because I already know how to read and I would have told you this but you make me completely uncomfortable with your words so I never said a word.</p>

<p>By doing this you give us no guidance on our papers.&nbsp; I thought it was lame that you decided to show a movie and a cop out because you chose not to give us any instruction.&nbsp; I know that it was a movie based on the story in the play we read but it was not teaching to show it to us when you could have been teaching us to write what you wanted us to write on our papers instead.&nbsp; The movie was completely racist and very offensive because it contained cultural stereotypes that are often used in disrespectful jokes about people who have their feelings hurt all the time.&nbsp; I was offended by this racism and in the movie and had my feelings hurt by it.&nbsp; If that was supposed to teach me something about the class I completely do not understand.</p>

<p>After this quarter I am hurt and tired and feel like talking to you now will do me no good.&nbsp; I wanted to go to your office hours but I could not find the time or make myself because of your words.&nbsp; I feel like my paper was written to the best of my ability in reference to your teaching skills in the discussions.&nbsp; You grade my papers poorly but do not realize that you do so because they reflect your teaching skills.&nbsp; Other people may have done well with your skills but I did not and would have talked to you but what you said about grading fairly made me uncomfortable.&nbsp; I take my responsibilities as a man and I have never complained about my grades but this one I will because I did not need you to teach me how to read or to write.&nbsp; I have made very high grades in all my other writing classes and even though I had many disputes with those instructors we always settled them to my happiness.&nbsp; Now for the first time I can not talk to you to settle my grades because I am uncomfortable to talk or even write to you.&nbsp; I should have stayed strong and like a man no matter how much your words and what you said offended me.&nbsp; I do not blame you because when there is error there are two to blame, the perceiver and the target.&nbsp; I do not know what this email does but I have to get my feelings off of my chest.&nbsp; Thank you for reading this and I am sorry if what I feel has shown you disrespect but these are my feelings and I feel by your words you did not respect them.&nbsp; I love everyone and believe you to possibly be a great person but with your words you have treated me completely unfairly.</p>

<p>I am a very religious man and I love every one but I will forward this letter to the head of your department so he can see that I am a serious student who does not deserve the grade you will give him because I write so very well.</p></blockquote><p><em><strong>First, a <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/i_am_making_peo.html">Reply to Some Criticisms</a>.<br /></strong></em></p>

<p>Whenever I get emails with prose like this in them (USUALLY IN ALL CAPS!!!!! WITH EXCLAMATION POINTS!!! AND SMILEYS :-D!!!), I get a little voice for that student in my head that aligns with his prose style. Then, unfortunately, my brain overlays that voice on top of everything they say out loud. So for the rest of the semester, all I hear from them is TEACHER THIS IS YOUR STUDENT FROM YOUR SURVEY CLASS I DONT KNOW WHATS GOING ON BECAUSE YOU DIDNT EXPLAIN IT TO ME I CANT DO THE READING!!!!! :-D</p></span>

		<span id="comment-63998736-content"><p>It&#39;s almost poetic.  Maybe a villanelle, with the repetition, or a Shakespearean sonnet, with slightly varied repetitions and the last two lines veering off.  Perhaps a sestina, though there&#39;d need to be six things to repeat, and so far I&#39;ve only got &quot;words.&quot; </p>

<p>This might be how you know you&#39;ve been in grad school too long -- this, and the fact that I really latched onto &quot;so if I learned anything it is how to read things in too much detail&quot; and thought -- yes! He learned how to close read!</p>

<p>I&#39;m seriously thinking of trying to turn this into a poem, if that wouldn&#39;t hurt your feelings or your religious sensibility.  It will probably languish in the back of my mind, along with &quot;Having a Cold with You&quot; And other poems I&#39;ve meant to write but haven&#39;t.</p></span>

Straight in my heart discomfort rose,<br />
Shaking that pen that ever strong<br />
Was used in writing graceful prose,<br />
And taught it things it knew all wrong.<br />

And fouled it as rotting pomes<br />
Doth foul a bunch, which, like old grease<br />
From kitchen to dump is cast from homes.<br />

		<span id="comment-64020652-content"><p>Very good, eb.  But it needs less elegance.</p>

<p>Once within a classroom dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,<br />
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br />
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br />
As of a voice gently rapping, rapping about some writing chore.<br />
`&#39;Tis the TA,&#39; I muttered, `rapping about some writing chore -<br />
Only this, and nothing more.&#39;</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br />
`Sir,&#39; said I, `by Email, truly your instruction I deplore;<br />
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently your voice flapping,<br />
And incessant mapping, mapping of your lesson plans galore<br />
That you make me quite uncomfortable  - here I opened wide the door; -<br />
For complaints and nothing more.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>In your class I have been guessing, but no syllable expressing<br />
To the incessent voice now burned into my brainstem&#39;s core;<br />
More and more I sat divining, with my head slackly reclining<br />
On how to get the grade that I could have gloated o&#39;er<br />
That GPA-gainful grade that I could be gloating o&#39;er<br />
But my marks, they are poor.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>`Instructor!&#39; said I, `thing of evil! - grader still, though but a devil!<br />
By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God that I adore -<br />
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the final grading,<br />
I shall clasp a higher rating then the one I had before -<br />
Or the head of your department shall hear of it galore -<br />
Quoth the TA, `Nevermore.&#39;</p>

<p><br />
(Are English department teaching grad students called TAs, as those in the sciences are?  Oh well.)</p></span>

<p>To quote one of my favorite TV shows: &quot;The goggles. They do nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>How dare you speak words to him Scott and not asking him what grade he wanted. Can&#39;t you see he write so very well?</p>

<p>On the serious side, I&#39;ve run across this attitude in my fellow undergrads. The more I like the Professor, the more chance it seems one of these will be in the class. This gentleman seems to be a non-native speaker (oh god please be a non-native speaker) but usually they seem to be entitled brat. They go on to their fellow students before class about how they&#39;ve never receive anything lower than an A on a paper in High school and how their teachers told them they wrote on a college level. </p>

<p>Annoying enough in a survey class, but in upper level classes I start thinking of places to hide their body. </p>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/what_wait_when.html"><span><strong>What, Wait, When?</strong> As mentioned elsewhere yesterday, I'm reading Allegra Goodman's Intuition on the advice of a friend in the hard sciences who claims it the most accurate (sociologically speaking) account of interlab dynamics. &quot;Goodman captures,&quot; she said, &quot;what happens when scientists stop being polite and start being real.&quot; (She reddened before the last word left her mouth.) I'm not sure she meant the entire novel—near the end, a lapsed Jew saves his lab's reputation in a House subcommittee by invoking Godwin's Law—but the routine indignance and perfunctory jealousy outlined in the first half of the novel ring true enough. What makes this novel unique, possibly even brilliant, is the sly turn Goodman pulls more than halfway through it. To this humanist, the descriptions of research sound bleeding edge. Isolating strains of a virus and militating them against cancer cells? Sounds plenty contemporary to me. Then I stumble across this passage on page 165: Larry and Wendy militated to keep software in the public domain and away from greedy profiteers like Lotus and Wordperfect, and their upstart rival, Microsoft. While other people wore FREE MANDELA T-shirts, Larry and Wendy donned shirts emblazoned FREE SOFTWARE. Microsoft an upstart? Mandela still imprisoned? This novel takes place in the '80s. Skimming through the first 164 pages, I find one passage about a backwards character eager to discuss Reagan's Star Wars initiative; but because this character prides himself on possessing the mindset of an earlier era, I took that reference as one more indication of his obsolescence. Sprung as it is, the Microsoft reference must be intentional. There's no other reason to, pause the sentence, and highlight, that Microsoft is, an upstart rival. Goodman wanted the reader to be shocked out of his or her moment, to feel their woeful ignorance of all this scientific. The ploy is well-played. Only now I feel like a ham.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/i_am_making_peo.html"><span><strong>I Am Making People Uncomfortable with My Words and What I Say</strong> Someone sent me a link to this page, in which the content of my previous post is discussed. I'm not familiar enough with the conventions of livejournal to decipher who says what, but I want to address some of the issues raised there. First, in regards to this post, I considered everyone would know of my love for Philip K. Dick and understand that I was having a thoroughly modernist laugh at haughty types who would exclude him from any future canon. Second, I'm not laughing (or asking others to laugh) at anything other than an outrageous display of entitlement. What I mocked in the post was not a particular student so much as a type of student. Someone suggested this speaks poorly of me personally and as emissary for the profession. Perhaps. But only the outrageously entitled will think poorly of me for mocking outrageous entitlement ... and I'm not interested in pandering to that particular demographic. (White patriarchal privilege being something I demystify in my class, not encourage.) Third, the person who compared me to a character in a David Lodge novel (not in a complimentary sense) is onto something: I may not be as much of character as Dr. B., but my persona here is tailored. (As noted previously, people who meet me off-line often describe me as &quot;nice.&quot;) I've been meaning to write more about this for some time now, but lack the sense of self-importance required to write introspectively for long periods of time. Maybe someday. Fourth, to the person who said &quot;composing it as real seems precisely Kaufman's style,&quot; what can I do but confess? (Again, that is.) The letter is written in the style of the student's complaint, but I had a little fun with it. The student may find some of the phrasing familiar, but I freely admit to doctoring the original email. Granted, I parroted the style and diction as best I could. (As the resident poets have noticed, there may be a little more lyricism in my version than there was in the original.) Thing is, writing in someone else's style is something I do rather regularly (if rarely so explicitly). I'm a firm believer in the apprenticeship model of developing prose and frequently inhabit other writer's voices for dramatic effect. Fifth, the complaint is neither recent nor accurate: I'm on a leave of absence this year; and as my former students who piped up in the comments will attest, I'm eminently approachable. (I could trace the origins of my decidedly feminist pedagogy here, but as I spent last week detailing my &quot;teaching philosophy&quot; for job applications, the thought of that discussion turns my stomach.) On an unrelated note, I'm not sure what to make of the fact that every six months or so I write something that people genuinely want to share with others. (Jealous complaints about my over-exposure notwithstanding.) Building off my recent defense of n+1, I'm tempted to think that were I writing in a more traditional...</span></a></div>
