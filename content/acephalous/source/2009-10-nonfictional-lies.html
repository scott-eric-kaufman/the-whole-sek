<p>Memory is a funny thing. One Saturday morning, as a child, I was telling my parents about the Coyote v. Roadrunner cartoon I&#39;d just watched. One episode involved a present-wrapping maching: obviously, instead of the Roadrunner, it was Coyote who got caught in it, and ended up as a small white package with a pink ribbon and coyote feet.... hilarious. But my mother pointed out that we had a black and white TV, so how did I know the bow was pink? I still don&#39;t understand, and my memory of that pink bow is almost as strong today as it was then. </p>

<p>I have to admit, my view of what matters in terms of post editing is more pragmatic than orthodox: if you notice an error before anyone else comments on it, or quotes it, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re doing any substantive harm to the fabric of the Web by making minor corrections. (In this case, since you&#39;ve publicly admitted to your otherwise unnoticeable correction, you&#39;re doubly covered, ethically speaking.)</p>

<p>All the best, Scott. If there&#39;s anything we at a distance can do, do not hesitate to let us know, publicly or privately.</p></span>

<p>On the subject of memory filling-in things, what you call &#39;nonfictional lies&#39; are known to psychologists as &#39;confabulations&#39; and increasingly it&#39;s being recognised just how much of all our memories are composed of and pieced-together by them.  Usually it doesn&#39;t matter and we don&#39;t notice.  It&#39;s only in cases like yours when we feel the need to check over and compare with other sources of information that they even come to light.</p></span>

You said at that time that the hand of God pushed the car at the last second and you missed a dead on hit with a tree.  It seems that someone may indeed be watching out for you.  One accident with minor injuries at 16; one hit by a car on campus that should have killed you , but just gave you a great deal of pain and now, another accident that could have killed you or seriously injured you.  I believe someone is trying to send you a message.  Think about it!</p></span>

Traffic crawled, then halted. I idled in the middle lane, flanked on the right by a semi-trailer. We breached the fog at about the same time, but the truck slipped a few car-lengths farther forward. On NPR someone said something about some pressing issue, but I couldn't pay attention because in my rear-view mirror a luxury sedan was barreling into the fog-bank at a speed I can't estimate but knew was inadvisable. I made every effort to become visible despite the fog. I laid into the horn, turned on the hazards, and at the last moment, as I readied for impact, I was seen. The sedan switched lanes, slammed into the semi, spun some and, irrevocably crushed, fell from the road. I pulled over and jumped from the car, ran to help, as did someone else, maybe the driver of the semi, but someone from that direction. We reached the sedan at about the same time, him dialing 911, me pointing at the car, us running toward it together to help, but there was no one to help. What was there, in the car, was beyond help. I must've stumbled, or leaned forward, because the vomit was over my right arm, as if I'd braced myself beforehand. I took off my shirt, looked at the other man, who either puked first or reacted to me, and we stared, not at each other so much, but still, we stared and I felt that he felt the act was mutual. Was a recognition. I made my way to my car. I drove to campus. Bought a sweatshirt from the bookstore and ran into a friend on the way to class. His &quot;How are you?&quot; loosed a torrent of unprocessed words punctuated by profanity, words that made what happened mean, in the basest sense. I went to class, set the kids to writing, walked out of the class. Called the wife, who talked me into telling them what happened. I did. Said they could peer review what they'd written and I'd let them go. Then I didn't. Said instead that I would teach the class, that it was better than the meaningless pacing, the nothing I could do to erase what I'd seen, the nothing I could've done to have done something. I fell into the rhythm of the class, lectured more than I usually do, but forgot, for those minutes, what I'd seen, what I'd done but couldn't do. Now I'm in the library writing this. Writing helps. It's the process. It's what makes the word mean what they mean. I still have another hour and fifteen minutes until my next class, and now that I've written this, I'm not sure what to do. I think I might describe a circle around the campus, sate hunger with weary, because food is not a viable option at the moment.</span></a></div>
