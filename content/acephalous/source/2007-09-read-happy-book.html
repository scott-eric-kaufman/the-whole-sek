			<p>The folks at <em><a href="http://phibetacons.nationalreview.com/">Phi Beta Cons</a> </em>are waxing anti-intellectual about Mary Collins' <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0914/p09s02-coop.html">complaint</a> in <em>The Christian Science Monitor</em>.&nbsp; According to Collins, her daughter has stopped reading because her school requires her to read novels with &quot;distressing plots [and] sad, even sinister, story lines.&quot;&nbsp; <a href="http://phibetacons.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTA0ODU5Y2E2NjYzNjNjNTg4YWVjZDljNjRkOTVjZmU=">Most interesting</a> to Carol Iannone, however, is Collins' account of a conversation she had with some of her daughter's classmates:</p><blockquote><p>The string of searing plot patterns has resulted in some very
peculiar unintended consequences. Most of the students I spoke with
from my daughter's middle school claimed that the readings made them
feel inadequate because they never &quot;experienced these horrible things.&quot;
</p>

<p>&quot;It becomes awkward,&quot; one student said, &quot;because you're constantly made to feel spoiled or privileged.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Her co-blogger, David French, <a href="http://phibetacons.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZDgxYmQyZTY0NGNjNDBjM2MzMmM3YTRkOTc1MWQ5YTc=">picks up the baton</a> and—in a move calculated to prove, definitively, his nub-mindedness—promptly thwacks the first professor he sees:</p><blockquote><p>I enjoyed Carol’s post highlighting how the typical college reading
assignment seems designed to make students feel “spoiled or
privileged.”&nbsp; In fact, professorial contempt for “spoiled or
privileged” students is nauseatingly common.&nbsp; Yet this is yet another
example of academic blindness.&nbsp; It is tough to imagine a more
“privileged” person than a tenured faculty member at a major
university.&nbsp; Six figure income.&nbsp; Ten month work year.&nbsp; Absolute job

<p>French forgot to apply it.&nbsp; He speaks here, openly, for the downtrodden, <em>i.e.</em> the spoiled, privileged children of wealth.&nbsp; He is nauseated by the contempt in which these spoiled, privileged children are held.&nbsp; That they behave in spoiled, privileged ways is irrelevant.&nbsp; That is their culture, see, and these postmodern multiculturalists are hypocrites for shitting on these children's unearned pretensions.&nbsp; </p>

<p>To return to my original point—which, to be honest, I've yet to even hint at—Collins suggests that these children can be cheered up by reading something chipper like <em>Huck Finn</em>.&nbsp; Because once Huck and Tom fool Jim into thinking he's still enslaved, then torture him for a little while in order to satisfy Tom's love of historical romance—well, those are an absolute hoot.&nbsp; Guaranteed to cheer up a sallow youth any day.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For that matter, why not have them read <em>Connecticut Yankee</em>?&nbsp; It's finale is clean, wholesome fun for children of all ages.&nbsp; &nbsp;I mean, The Boss insists that the electrocuted knights be delivered a <em>coup de grace</em>, when he <em>could </em>have left them on the field to die horribly and alone, save for the screams and rattles of their compatriots.</p>

<p>My point, then, is that the canon debate factors into these issues in ways we shouldn't, but do, ignore.&nbsp; If Twain wrote <em>Huck Finn </em>today, I guarantee Collins and her ilk would complain about it being taught to their children.&nbsp; (They do, of course, but for different reasons.)</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t actually matter whether someone has rewritten Jackson&#39;s &quot;The Lottery&quot; or the child is reading the original like countless middleschoolers before her, since Collins brief mention of it suggests that she thinks it&#39;s plot is some shocking new betrayal of innocence to inflict on children, rather than a public school institution.</p></span>

<p>&quot;I have never been called to the principal&#39;s office for pushing my (honors) students to read and write above grade level...until today.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t technically reprimanded, but I was asked to engage in a &quot;self-critique&quot; of my expectations for my students, which I did for all of two seconds.</p>

<p>After school, I received a call from a parent--presumably one of the parents who had earlier contacted the school administration about my draconian methods and pie-in-the-sky expectations--who wanted to pull her kid from my class. &quot;It seems like there&#39;s just too much reading in your class.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;m the asshole.&quot;</p>

And are they comparing, oh, Steven Greenblatt&#39;s salary (which I have to assume is considerable, but I imagine--here me McArdling--not in the mid 6&#39;s) to a newly minded Associate Prof at, say, Brooklyn College (where, so far as I know, it&#39;s more like 65K and then into the high 80s with full prof). Certainly comp sci or law profs can be paid more; but they&#39;re talking about the humanities, I presume.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ve seen several asst prof jobs that pay 40K.</p>

A few years ago, an undergrad suggested that we get rid of the six-figure types and use their salaries for something, you know, useful.  At the time, about six people on the faculty were earning in the six figures (low 100s)--I think there are more now--and, amazingly, they fell into one of three categories: business department; administrators; faculty at special ranks (e.g., University Professor) and/or ex-administrators who had been around for three decades or more.

<p>Collins and Iannone, however, get to something more interesting.  What about the Bible and Christianity&#39;s ability to distress a young reader?  Does Christ&#39;s sacrifice make Collins&#39; cohort of little girls feel inadequate?  Does not the Sermon on the Mount make them feel spoiled and privileged? What of the biblical passage about rich people, the eye of a needle, and the difficulty of reaching heaven? I guess those little middle school girls are numb to, or unaware of, those distressing stories that justify the existence of the forum in which Collins complained.  What does that say about what Collins and her fellow mothers are teaching their children? - TL</p></span>

The other reason I held back was, well, because the mother took the story so literally, whereas it&#39;s really difficult to do that with the Jackson.  In retrospect, I&#39;m not sure Collins deserved the benefit of my doubt.</p>

<p>DM, it&#39;s not the parents fault, or, at least not entirely.  After all, college students air the same complaints, despite being out of their parents&#39; homes.  Quite simply: they don&#39;t want to read, and they&#39;ll complain to anyone who will listen: parents, principals, course coordinators, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Miriam, it doesn&#39;t surprise me that French and his ilk are pinning these salaries on humanities types: we&#39;re the useless ones, after all, whereas the business folk, well, they make money.</p>

<p>Tim, quit your logical and rational whining.  Don&#39;t you see how oppressed the wealthy are?  Have a little heart, won&#39;t you?</p></span>

<p>and btw, my students all seem to be a helluva lot more privileged than me at the moment...better dressed, nicer cars, faster internet.  so i&#39;ma find some readings to make them feel like shit!</p></span>

As my attempts barely rate pathetic, you should risk a shot. (I see JPool already has.) I care not what Mr. Bear's crying about—could be global warming destroying his habitat, or it could be having to read Lacan—so long as it's funny, I'm happy. The winner, well, the winner will have me add the winning caption to the photograph. (How's that for incentive?) UPDATE: The photograph originates here.

Upon reading Miriam's response to yesterday's post, it occurs to me that Collins proposes a novel standard of literary value. Convene the PTA on the docks.
