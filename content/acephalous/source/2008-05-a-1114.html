<hr />

<p>I grouse because I care.&nbsp; I intended this post to be about the remarkable act of compression in the first paragraph.&nbsp; It's a thing of wonder, if you wonder about things like &quot;How can I lucidly jam the History of Everything into a single paragraph?&quot;&nbsp; Eagleton's answer:</p>

<blockquote><p>All literary works are anonymous, but some are more anonymous than
others. It is in the nature of a piece of writing that it is able to
stand free of its begetter, and can dispense with his or her physical
presence. In this sense, writing is more like an adolescent than a
toddler. I might pass you a note at a meeting, but a note is only a
note if it can function in my absence. Writing, unlike speech, is
meaning that has come adrift from its source. Some bits of writing—theatre tickets or notes to the milkman, for example—are more closely
tied to their original contexts than <em>Paradise Lost</em> or <em>War and Peace</em>.
Fiction (since it is imaginary) has no real-life original context at
all, and hermeneutically speaking can therefore circulate a lot more
freely than a shopping list or a bus ticket. Literary works are
peculiarly portable. They can be lifted from one interpretative
situation to another, and may change their meaning in the course of
this migration. <em>Waiting for Godot</em> as performed in San Quentin
prison is not quite the same play as Peter Hall’s first London
production. We cannot simply put Auschwitz out of our minds while
watching <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>. Writerly meaning does not
always trump readerly meaning. Walter Benjamin believed that works of
literature secreted certain meanings which might be released only in
their afterlife, as they came to be read in as yet unforeseeable
situations. He thought much the same about history in general. The past
itself is alterable, since the future casts it in a new light. Whether
John Milton belonged to a species which ended up destroying itself is
up to us and our progeny. The future possibilities of <em>Hamlet</em>
are part of the play’s meaning, even though they may never be realised.
One of the finest English novels, Samuel Richardson’s 18th-century
masterpiece <em>Clarissa</em>, became newly readable in the light of the 20th-century women’s movement.</p></blockquote><p>

Surely literary critics have developed more effective language for conveying the (not terribly complicated) concepts of context, authorship and reception, than the Saying a Bunch of Stuff approach that Eagleton employs here.  You can try and pass this off as erudition (boy he sure know a lot of things!), but that doesn&#39;t make it good writing.</p></span>

I was recommended his introductory book, <i>Literary Theory</i>, as the first book of literary theory that I read.  I could tell that he was writing through his hat as he proceeded to confidently write a whole lot of stuff that I&#39;d guess that he&#39;d disavow now.  You really shouldn&#39;t write an introductory book that you&#39;d have to disavow a couple of decades later.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-116584442-content"><p><em>God, that was awful prose.</em></p>

<p>Really?  It was jaunty, certainly, but given the amount of ground he had to cover, it was impressively disconnected.  Or its disconnections were impressive.  What I mean is, when you&#39;re trying to cover that much material in that short a space, you&#39;re likely to fail miserably.  If you get any kind of rhythm going -- and I&#39;d argue Eagleton does -- you have to consider it a success.</p>

<p><em>Surely literary critics have developed more effective language for conveying the (not terribly complicated) concepts of context, authorship and reception, than the Saying a Bunch of Stuff approach that Eagleton employs here.</em></p>

<p>Curious.  I think you and I are coming at this from different disciplinary perspectives, because the question he&#39;s addressing is, in literary studies, terribly complicated, and I&#39;m impressed by Eagleton&#39;s ability to boil it down here in a way that doesn&#39;t strip it of its complexity.  The fact that he makes it seem uncomplicated is, to my mind, what makes this graph work so well.</p>

<p><em>What actually strikes me about that passage is how tentative it is.</em></p>

<p>As it should be, I think, because it&#39;s an issue that&#39;s difficult to address generally.  Later in the review he actually addresses some specifics, but at this point, I think he&#39;s trying to defamiliarize the concept of authorship while presenting a capsule of its history.  In that regard, I think he does a remarkable job of presenting the debates in arguments he can expect a reasonably intelligent audience to understand.</p>

<p><em>I was recommended his introductory book, Literary Theory, as the first book of literary theory that I read. I could tell that he was writing through his hat as he proceeded to confidently write a whole lot of stuff that I&#39;d guess that he&#39;d disavow now.</em></p>

<p></em>Literary Theory</em> is schizophrenic, yes, but productively so.  The fact that he presents everything through a forthrightly Marxist lens makes it easier to teach than so-called &quot;objective&quot; disciplinary histories, since I can just tell my kids to ignore everything about class and concentrate on the rest.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-116633516-content"><p>I think the difference in our reactions here is less disciplinary than aesthetic.  I just find Eagleton&#39;s &quot;all declarative statements all the time&quot; approach here off-putting.  He&#39;s not giving the history of anything, so far as I can tell, but is giving examples of works doing something or other outside of the context of their original production.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to say that the concepts themselves don&#39;t open up complicated questions, I&#39;m saying that the basic concepts, that authors can intend all sorts of things, but we don&#39;t read their works with them in the room, shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to put across, even to the &quot;punters&quot; in slightly more interesting sentences.  I agree that he builds up a rhythm, it&#39;s just not one that I enjoy.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/05/no-actual-stude.html"><span><strong>No Actual Students were Harmed in the Composition of this Post</strong> The plot of this blog post is about why I have not been posting and I am writing it like this because my wife, to whom I am married, is currently grading papers. She uses the adjective &quot;excellent&quot; to describe the papers to me. It is a descriptive word. Its description is emotional and resonates to people who have emotions. The reason I have not been blogging, which I mentioned earlier is crucial to the plot of this blog post, is for many reasons. The first reason is that I have been watching my iRobot Roomba vacuum the apartment. Although it is supposed to be a time-saving device, many experts believe that the time people waste watching an iRobot Roomba vacuum an apartment eliminates the function of its time-saving. The second reason I have not been blogging is because I have been exercising. According to the government agency called the National Institute of Health in a book with the title Energize Yourself! Stay Physically Active, it is important to stay physically active because physical activity: can make you feel more energetic can help you lose weight and control your appetite help you sleep better Other benefits include: lower your chance for diabetes lower your chance for a stroke lower your blood pressure The National Institute of Health is from the government and a reliable source. Therefore I believe and trust them because they are trustworthy. Exercise and physical activity are a good thing and I am doing them instead of blogging. The third and final reason that I am not blogging is because I hate Mark Twain. Mark Twain was an American writer in the last century. His many books, which include masterpieces like Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, are called masterpieces by the experts in literature who read them. Mark Twain is also a rat-bastard who spins gleefully in his grave every time a scholar tries to figure out the racial politics of Pudd'nhead Wilson. This is the third and last of the three reasons I have not been blogging.</span></a></div>
