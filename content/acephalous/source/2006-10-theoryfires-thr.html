        <meta name="description" content="The five theoryfires that broke out this week serve as a blunt reminder that cooler heads and recent comity have not eliminated the theory hazard from the forest.

Despite the lack of heat, the 2005 theoryfires unconcealed nearly 165,293 acres. Drought conditions in the months since have created a heavy fuel load. “You know have fast dead grass grows when it doesn’t rain,” said U.S. Philosophy Service spokeswoman Lisa Comerford. “But so long as there are no gusty windbags, our crews can build lines to prevent the theoryfires from jumping and causing too much damage,” she added.

			<p>The five theoryfires that broke out this week serve as a blunt
reminder that cooler heads and recent comity have not eliminated the
theory hazard from the forest.&nbsp; Authorities are reluctant to speculate,
but most believe the recent spate theoryfires were <a href="http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2006/10/absent_guilt.html#c24009728">deliberately lit</a>.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/theoryfires1.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/theoryfires1.jpg" title="Theoryfires1" alt="Theoryfires1" class="image-full" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left; width: 400px; height: 380px;" /></a>

2005 had been the worst year on record for theoryfires, but this week’s
blazes have experts fearing that 2006 may be even worse.&nbsp; The <a href="http://thevalve.org/valve/%E2%80%9D%3Ca">problem</a> is especially severe in locations <a href="http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2006/10/absent_guilt.html">ravaged by drought</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
“The problem is we have extremely dry fuels,” said Capt. Dennis
Whaling, head of the local Theoryfire Prevention Service (TPS).&nbsp; “Some
wind and a few sparks and these tumbleweeds become bouncing molotov
cocktails.&nbsp; We sent a TPS Report to everyone in Aletheia county urging
people to dispose of stray tumbleweed properly, but it looks like no
one got the memo.”
</p>
<p>Whaling and his staff scoff at the notions that 2005 theoryfires
unconcealed enough brush to prevent another series of costly
conflagrations.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
“<a href="http://pasaudela.blogspot.com/2006/01/light-not-heat.html">All light, no heat</a>,” Whaling said.
</p>
<p>
Despite the lack of heat, the 2005 theoryfires unconcealed nearly
165,293 acres.&nbsp; Drought conditions in the months since have created a
heavy fuel load.
</p>
<p>“You know have fast dead grass grows when it doesn’t rain,” said
U.S. Philosophy Service spokeswoman Lisa Comerford.&nbsp; “But so long as
there are no gusty windbags, our crews can <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/10/blogfight_an_ou.html">build lines</a> to prevent the theoryfires from jumping and causing too much damage,” she added.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after midnight, Whaling’s team received a frantic call from
Heath Campiglio, an amateur thinker who lives in a small community
outside of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zzyzx,_California">Zzyzx, CA</a>.&nbsp; “I was Being-in-the-Woods, minding my own business, when I saw something across Interstate 15,” Campiglio said.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/irvinelake.jpg"><img border="0" class="image-full" alt="Irvinelake" title="Irvinelake" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/irvinelake.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right; width: 400px; height: 360px;" /></a>
Aletheia County Theoryfirefighters responded immediately, but by the time they reached Zzyzx, the theoryfire had <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/terry_eagletons_traditional_theology_and_a_new_version_of_pascals_wager/">tripled in size</a>. 
Around 7 a.m., Whaling redirected personnel to the theoryfire’s western
boundary. Crews marched up a hillside and hiked a few miles inward,
where they would use ready-to-hand tools to cut theoryfire lines.
</p>
<p> “We set up an antithesis here to keep this thing from spreading,” said
 Chandler Huxman, a volunteer <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/people/smokejumpers/redding/fire_call.html">theoryjumper</a>
from Bunkie, Louisiana.&nbsp; “If the theoryfire on the other side of the
line crests this hill, it’s liable to synthesize the whole <strong>[expletive]</strong> county.”
</p>
<p>
Local theoryfire experts like Martin Tillich believe that if Huxman and
his theoryjumpers are unable to contain the Zzyzx blaze, it may consume
the county’s only tourist attraction.&nbsp; “I don’t think the economy can
handle the loss of our historic softwood forests,” said Tillich. 
“These Giant Sequoias were here before Plato, before Socrates.&nbsp; It
would be a tragedy to lose them.”
</p>
<p>
Tuesday’s <a href="http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2006/10/absent_guilt.html#c24009728">gusty windbags</a> have put them directly in harm’s way, Whaling said.
</p>
<p>
By next Tuesday, a somber Tillich replied, “all that’s left of these sublime giants could be a burnt-out clearing.”

They should have done -- hmm -- something about the friend/enemy distinction as it applies to the &quot;low Leiters&quot; vs &quot;high Leiters&quot;, with a sideline on how evolutionary, neurological, and indeed all vaguely scientistic examination of culture can not work because &quot;the Artist is he who decides on the exception&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;tripled in size&quot; link doesn&#39;t even lead to anything about theory, though.</p></span>

<p>I did notice one of the hands-down funniest sentences, when taken out of context, that I&#39;ve seen on a blog in some time:</p>

<p>&quot;Warszawa was temporarily dismissed from Lenin’s Tomb, for an unspecified time, as per this post and the specific order from Lenin reprinted below.&quot;</p>

<p>You can feel the yearning in that sentence.  There should be advertisements, like the U.S. Army has, for A Vanguard Of One.</p>

<p>Oh, and in case someone bothers to copy over this comment as well, I basically agree with CR about the whole niqab thing.</p></span>

An Outsider's Perspective on The God Delusion Wars</strong> Because this couldn't be more ridiculous:</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/10/spam_poetry_par.html"><span><strong>Spam Poetry, Part II</strong> Unlike the previous installment—in which I transformed an entire &quot;work&quot; of spam into a single poem—this time I've culled single lines from a multitude of spam in an attempt to create eerily impersonal poetry. I've a file in which I store spam-text, so creating these poems consisted of finding just the right line to develop each to what I, in the spirit of the originals, will call its &quot;most maximal potential.&quot; I played by the rules this time—each line is rendered as it arrived in my inbox, with no change in tense or pronomial shifts—but in the future I may fiddle with the formula until &quot;I can deliver it superbly every time the way she likes it.&quot; For now, the rules are the rules &quot;even though most people don't know they exist yet.&quot; I think most of the lines will be recognized &quot;easily and instantly, without you having to do anything.&quot; I that think contributes to a charm &quot;which will certainly be increasing over time, especially in the next year.&quot; So yes, the &quot;poems&quot;: Mostly Urgent* The great prognosis is drawn up. The achievements of our highly capable partnership will exceed all expectations. The key is getting in early. We have a place for you. Can you confirm your interest in our mutual respect? We will remember your notification number. The transaction is without risk. You should not entertain any fear at all. There will be no stopping this one. Right now we wait for it triple. Increases are not down lately. We advise you to buy today. *Our target is a modular fish system. Race War The race war will come. You will likely be a winner. Chief John's Plan My name is Chief John. I have a very sensitive Plan which may interest you if You are not the man you once were. If you have ever wanted To reclaim the virile potency of your youth, Give my plan a thought and get back to me soon, As a demonstration of your interest In recapturing your masculinty With rapid short term growth. Bad Timing You can live a longer and fuller life unless The cause of death is suspicious. (By then it will be too late.) Real Men Hear Voices Imagine being able to have: Died in a boat accident when returning from a business trip— With your entire family in a tragic plane crash— From an unexpected cancer of the breast— At the hands of unpatriotic rebels— Or suddenly. You would surely take advantage of the opportunity To see your loved ones taken care of. But do not tell them them when you start communicating with them. (Except for the brother of the President: No one can scare a real alpha male.) We Aim to Articulate We seek history. We are casting our net widely. Spectacles and speculations frame us. They are made of history. Guaranteed. Unnecessary Risk We will reclaim necessity. It will help us navigate The many dangers out there For people just like you....</span></a></div>
