<p>&quot;I have read <em>too closely</em>,&quot; he should admit.&nbsp; &quot;I sound like a belligerent wino.&quot;</p>

<p>Under <em>no</em> circumstances should he declare his professional credentials authorize the paranoid ravings of a belligerent wino.&nbsp; Which brings us to the case of Priya Venkatesan.&nbsp; Those who seek <a href="http://www.dartmouthindependent.com/archives/2008/05/post-9.html">background</a> or a serious discussion of Venkatesan should consult <a href="http://www.margaretsoltan.com/?p=3892">Margaret</a> <a href="http://www.margaretsoltan.com/?p=3901">Soltan</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=563">Timothy Burke</a>.&nbsp; I simply want to register my disgust with her pedagogical and interpretive skills.&nbsp; From her interview with <em>The Dartmouth Review</em>:</p><blockquote><p><span class="fullpost"><span style="font-weight: bold;">TDR</span>:
There is one specific incident where I heard from one of the girls in
your class who was pretty outspoken, and one day she hadn’t spoken for
a while and you said, “Could we have a round of applause for this girl,
she hasn’t spoken in ten minutes?”<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">PV</span>:
She was probably the most abrasive, the most offensive, the most
disruptive student. She ruined that class. She ruined it. She ruined
it. That class actually had a lot of potential, there were some really
bright kids there, but every time she would do a number of things that
were very inappropriate.&nbsp; [...]&nbsp; Then what happened was, I was lecturing on
morals and ethics and she just gave me this horrible look, and I was
pretty disturbed. I just said what is going on here? The problem with
[girl x] is that she can’t take criticism. She can’t take the fact that
there is something wrong with her work. Now, some people are like that,
a lot of people are like that, unable to take criticism, but the fact
of the matter is that I have the PhD in literature, I make the
assessment if someone has talent for philosophy, literary theory, and
literary criticism. A student might say, well, the hell with you I’m
still going to become a literary critic, I had to do that, there were
people who criticized me while I was a student, you’re not a good
writer or whatever, but I said well I’m still going to go ahead with my
goals, but I never made any personal attacks on them or made life
difficult for them or was rude to them. I just did the socially
acceptable way of dealing with criticism, and [girl x] is the kind of
student who does not know the socially acceptable way of dealing with
criticism. She thinks the way to go about doing it is to go to my
superior or to try to undermine my ability to teach the class. One of
the things that she did, this is also really interesting, was that she
would always ask me how to spell things. That was her thing. She would
say how to do you spell this? How to you spell that? I mean—what am I
supposed to do?—so I would tell her. One time Tom Cormen </span>[Chairman of Dartmouth's Writing Program] <span class="fullpost">was sitting in
the class, and she asked me, how many T’s are in <em>Gattaca</em>. This was the
kind of question she was asking, “how many T’s are in <em>Gattaca</em>?,” and I
was about to answer her and Tom Cormen pre-empted me, “two t’s.” I’ll
leave you to interpret it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">TDR</span>: No.&nbsp; No, I don’t understand that.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">PV</span>: I have to tell you: it means tenure track.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">TDR</span>: Oh, okay.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">PV:</span> Because I wasn’t tenured track.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">TDR</span>: Oh, okay, yes.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">PV</span>: They were trying to intimate that I wasn’t ready for tenure track.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">TDR:</span> Yes, okay, I didn’t realize that’s what that meant.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">PV</span>:
I’m kind of making this leap because this is the kind of subversiveness
that was going on in that environment. That [girl x] would ask how many
t’s are in <em>Gattaca</em> and that Tom Cormen would respond, “two T’s” as if I
had no grasp on tenure track.&nbsp; But with [girl x], something’s going on
with her. I’m not a doctor, but she’s not all there.</span></p></blockquote><p>First, encouraging the class to <em>applaud </em>a student's silence is appalling.&nbsp; That the students <em>later</em> applauded when one of their number challenged her claim about the benefit of Enlightenment science for women is not, as she would have it, a sign of unconscious racism, but an indication that they'd been paying attention.&nbsp; She created a classroom in which the silencing of certain opinions demanded applause, and only complained when <em>her </em>silencing brought down the house.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Second, the interpretation of Cormen's <em>direct</em> response to the [girl x]'s <em>direct </em>question is a masterpiece of irrationality.&nbsp; For it to work <em>as a reading</em> one must believe the student knew &quot;TT&quot; refers to &quot;tenure-track,&quot; otherwise Venkatesan had no cause to list it among the further annoyances of &quot;[girl x].&quot;&nbsp; The odds that a freshman knows what the abbreviation &quot;TT&quot; means are long.&nbsp; The odds that [girl x] intended to provoke Cormen's response are longer.&nbsp; The odds that Cormen responded to [girl x] with a wink and a nudge are longer still.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The <em>only </em>way Venkatesan's reading might obtain would be if &quot;<em>Gattaca</em>&quot; were spelled &quot;<em>Gataca</em>&quot; and Cormen had just presided over Venkatesan's review.&nbsp; &nbsp; Then I might buy it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>That said, I'll close with a bit of advice for <em>The Dartmouth Review.&nbsp; </em>Publishing unedited interview transcripts to make her sound more unsettled?&nbsp; Not cool.&nbsp; <em>Everyone</em> sounds like a lunatic when their speech is transcribed directly.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.errolmorris.com/content/profile/singer_predilections.html">Just ask Errol Morris</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah, and my habit is usually to correct misspellings and simple errors when quoting people, especially when quoting people I don&#39;t like. </p>

<p>But they can&#39;t win. Either they look like thugs taking cheap shots (which they probably were, though she did <i>grant</i> the interview) or she could accuse them of editing her words to her disadvantage. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t beat a conspiracist by taking the high road: they&#39;ll always find a way to make what you do an attack. Quote them? Unfair. Edit them? Biased. </p>

<p>I do like the equation of hypersensitive literary criticism with raving absurdity: I&#39;m sorry to say that it crystallizes thoughts I&#39;ve had about some fairly tendentious readings for years. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-113327938-content"><p>I read a message board post by a Dartmouth review staffer which claimed that she insisted the interview be published with as little editing as possible -- I guess, so her hard, gemlike truths could shine through the haze of media corruption.  There are so many baffling moments in there (Lyotard &quot;invented the term&quot; postmodernism?).  But I think you&#39;ve actually stumbled upon a great idea for Morris&#39;s next project.</p>

<p>&quot;My films are about people who think they&#39;re connected to something, although they&#39;re really not.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Errol Morris turns his gaze from offshore detention and torture centers to the faculty lounges of humanities centers in his quest to steadily troll through the seedy, unseemly underbelly of American society.</i></p>

<p>And the emails she sent out to let the students know they were going to be named in the lawsuit?  Holy cow.</p></span>

On the other hand, she&#39;s obviously a really bad person, based on the quoted remarks about her student.  In an extension of the legal principle of &quot;bad cases make bad law&quot;, I predict that everyone is going to have something to say about this case, each person finding support for whatever general societal hobbyhorse they rode in on, and none of it is going to mean anything.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-113347872-content"><p>I find this whole thing pretty distressing. Everyone I know has worked with/encountered crazy people in all manner of professional environments, including professional environments where the entrance bar is set, as the cliché goes, pretty high. This situation, however, will be used to argue for the <i>unique</i> silliness of the humanities...and then I note, as one of the comments at Soltan did, that Priya Venkatesan got her BA at Dartmouth in 1990. That&#39;s precisely the environment that might make a non-white person utterly nuts.</p>

<p>Not to excuse her, however: it&#39;s not *that* hard to do a working definition of postmodernism. And the incoherence of the reasoning above, even had it been edited, is/would be appalling: because of her degree, SHE&#39;s uniquely capable to block the gate to higher education in the humanities, whereas when she was a lowly undergrad, she bucked the system, man. </p>

<p>Pathetic, and I mean that in the sense of pathos. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-113387972-content"><p>I&#39;ve seen TT as an abreviation mostly online, and occasionally in print.  I&#39;ve never heard it used out loud.  But, as others have pointed out, that entire exchange, as Venkatesan described it, is bizarre.  While it&#39;s clear that she had no idea how to manage classroom interactions and that this student was, to some extent, fucking with her, the behavior of her faculty observer (supposedly preempting her answer to the student&#39;s question, not following up with her afterwards) also raises questions either about the accuracy of her account or the way that department was run.</p>

<p>What bothers me most about this whole thing is that on the one hand you have someone who, by all appearances, seems to be breaking down in a very public way and on the other the swirl of uses and projections that that public break down (or at the least, very poor behavior) can be put to.  I don&#39;t know what part if any of the train wreck between Venkatesan and her students was based on her race or gender, but not a small ammount of racism and sexism has come out in response to her case.  Right away the commenters over at UD started psychologizing Venkatesan as a bitter old spinster and I&#39;ve read others use her allegation of racism to indicate the hysterical nature of all such allegations within the academy.  All of which is to say that Rich is right about societal hobbyhorses, whether they are psot-modernism, the academy or racism/sexism.  But the horses chosen and the way they get ridden and responded to is also revealing and disturbing.</p></span>
