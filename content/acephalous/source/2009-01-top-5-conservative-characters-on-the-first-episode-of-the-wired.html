        <meta name="description" content="(This isn’t a guest post by nobody’s friend, Ben Shaprio. This is just a tribute. Via S, N!) I first got into HBO’s hit television program The Wired about two years ago. A stranger mentioned it to the person in front of him at the 700 Club cafeteria, and by the time I finished the first episode, I knew I would be telling people I was completely hooked. (This, by the way, is my Recruitment Rule for The Wired: watch the first four minutes. If you don’t like it by then, dump out.) I am so excited by my enthusiasm for the show, in fact, that I often tout the first episode of The Wired as the best show in the history of television. I don’t simply love this episode for its terrific acting, wonderful writing, quirkly plotting, or mind-boggling twists. I also love it because of its subtle conservatism. Here are the top five conservative characters on the first episode of The Wired. Beware—SPOILERS INCLUDED. 1. William Rawls: John Doman’s tough Homicide investigator, William Rawls, is the top conservative character on television, bar none. Rawls is a real man’s man, a true paragon of conservative integrity. He knows that America is a meritocracy and, according to Wikipedia, in Season 4 openly attacks the reverse racism of affirmative action by proving that, instead of working up the ranks honestly like he has, the blacks in the Baltimore Police Department were recruited up the chain of command because of the color of their skin. This racism created a leadership vacuum, and like true conservatives, Rawls knows the value of a true leader of men. He may not always love the men beneath him, but he knows they need discipline and is determined to give it to them. 2. Jimmy McNulty: If every public servant showed McNulty’s commitment to civic duty, we would never have heard the odious phrase “President-Elect Obama” said without a snigger. In this episode alone, McNulty attends a trial when he could have been at home and stays up all night to make sure his report is on his deputy’s desk at 0800 clean and with no typos. Here he is in a clip from Season 2, going above and beyond the call of duty: He’s also a family man who wants nothing more than the judge to give him more than three out of four weekends with his children. 3. Snot Boogie: Every Friday night, anonymous young black men would roll bones behind the Cut Rate, and every Friday night, Snot Boogie would wait until there was cash on the ground, grab it, and run away. Snot Boogie knew these games were unsanctioned and bravely confiscated the illegal proceeds even though he knew the young black men would catch him and beat his ass.

<p>I first got into HBO’s hit television program <em>The Wired</em> about two years ago. A stranger mentioned it to the person in front of him at the <em>700 Club</em>
cafeteria, and by the time I finished the first episode, I knew I would
be telling people I was completely hooked. (This, by the way, is my
Recruitment Rule for <em>The Wired</em>: watch the first four minutes.
If you don’t like it by then, dump out.) I am so excited by my
enthusiasm for the show, in fact, that I often tout the first episode
of <em>The Wired</em> as the best show in the history of television. I
don’t simply love this episode for its terrific acting, wonderful
writing, quirkly plotting, or mind-boggling twists. I also love it
because of its subtle conservatism. Here are the top five conservative
characters on the first episode of <em>The Wired</em>. Beware—SPOILERS INCLUDED.</p>

<p>He’s also a family man who wants nothing more than the judge to give him more than three out of four weekends with his children.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="wire1-snotboogie" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6706 " height="211" src="http://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/wire1-snotboogie.jpg?w=200&amp;h=211" title="wire1-snotboogie" width="200" /></p>
<p><strong>3. Snot Boogie:</strong> Every Friday night, anonymous
young black men would roll bones behind the Cut Rate, and every Friday
night, Snot Boogie would wait until there was cash on the ground, grab
it, and run away. Snot Boogie knew these games were unsanctioned and
bravely confiscated the illegal proceeds even though he knew the young
black men would catch him and beat his ass. To do what you know to be
right, no matter the consequence, is a true conservative value.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="thewire-anonymousyoungblackmen" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6707 " height="302" src="http://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/thewire-anonymousyoungblackmen.jpg?w=200&amp;h=302" title="thewire-anonymousyoungblackmen" width="200" /></p>
<p><strong>4. The Anonymous Young Black Men behind the Cut Rate:</strong>
The anonymous young black men behind the Cut Rate are American icons.
They let Snot Boogie in the game even though he always stole the money
because “[i]t’s America, man.” But it&#39;s not <em>liberal</em>
America, man, as should be obvious both by their devotion to the idea that
while this is a free country, all decisions have consequences, and their commitment to capital punishment. They could have just whooped
Snot Boogie’s ass like they always whoop his ass, but the anonymous
young black men behind the Cut Rate know how to prevent the next
generation of Snot Boogies from repeating the mistakes of the previous.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="wire1-stringerandbarks" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6708 " height="148" src="http://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/wire1-stringerandbarks.jpg?w=200&amp;h=148" title="wire1-stringerandbarks" width="200" /></p>
<p><strong>5. Avon Barksdale and Stringer Bell:</strong> I cheated
here, but this is a Top 5, not a Top 6. Avon and Stringer are pure
capitalists, compassionate but tough. Avon is a family man. When his
cousin D’Angelo comes to him asking for a job, Avon and Stringer decide
to give him one. But both men know there’s no such thing as a free
lunch, so they also decide to teach D’Angelo that, in America, hard
work is its own reward. Everyone has to start in the pit, but with a
little hard work, anyone can end up running a tower.</p>
<p>The first episode of <em>The Wired</em> is a show chock-full of
conservative values. It mentions God and quotes the Bible on a regular
basis. It debates police vs. criminals and free enterprise vs.
socialism. It promotes the value of the nuclear family—virtually every
character on the show has dealt with a broken home, and they all pay
the price for it. But everyone should know that the first episode of <em>The Wired</em> is one of the most conservative shows on TV.

It shows that you’re on top of things, and professors love stupids who are on top of things. I know they’re not homonyms, but, you know—if anyone's looking to unload property under a rock, drop me a line. (x-posted.)</span></a></div>

I don’t mean generally, because generally the answer is they don’t think about their media consumption any more than your average liberal. I mean specifically, that is, when they do consider how the media they consume intersects with the beliefs they profess, what happens? Thanks to Andrew Breitbart, we now have a daily glut of valuable insight into what it is to be a conservative for whom music, literature and film don’t nadir after Beethoven, Shakespeare and Bogart. Admittedly, some of the revelations are old hat, as with Breitbart’s confession of how certain conservatives really feel about the working poor: Whoever cast the Boston grotesques that littered the film, my hat’s off to you. These profoundly ugly people really created a backdrop that made you want to root for the kid not to be found and brought back to her natural origins. But most of Big Hollywood is so awesomely counter-intuitive Walter Benn Michaels wouldn’t touch it with your ten-foot pole. Exhibit A: Evan Sayet’s post on Bruce Springsteen’s secret conservatism, in which he claims that, while Springsteen the multimillionaire, rock star with the mansion in Beverly Hills may be a Liberal, Bruce Springsteen the poet is one-hundred percent Republican. Those of you currently reading Dante in your sophomore English classes take note: Sayet someone out. Not that I need to tell you this, but the Commedia is written by Dante the Man about Dante the Pilgrim as narrated by Dante the Poet. The Poet is the fiction’s conceit—the character who remembers and recalls what happened after he found himself per una selva oscura—and is not to be treated coextensive with Dante the Man. I invoke Dante here because Springsteen, like Dante, is frequently confused for his narrators by people who should know better. No one reads “Caliban upon Setebos” and mistakes the theological musings of Prospero’s deformed manservant for a definitive statement of Browning’s philosophy; whereas with Springsteen, every word his narrators utter is an expression of his personal beliefs even when he opens with a lyric like “[m]y name is Joe Roberts.” By these lights, Springsteen the Poet is a conservative because Joe Roberts believes a “man [who] turns his back on his family, well, he just ain’t no good.” As that belief plugs neatly into the fallacy whereby family values are conservative values are Republican values, Springsteen the Poet would’ve been besotted by Sarah Palin and voting for John McCain. If that sounds simple-minded, you likely won’t be impressed by Sayet’s Sowell-lite philosophizing: liberals believe “man is born good and then corrupted by the institutions of society,” whereas conservatives believe “man is born with a dual and conflicting nature—capable of good and evil and everything in between—requiring cultural forces to help him tamp down the darker side and cultivate the good within.” By these druthers, any song in which options are weighed lilts conservative; any song that narrates the selection of the correct option must, therefore,...</span></a></div>
