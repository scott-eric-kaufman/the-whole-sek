<p>Fucking in the bushes or in the library stacks or in a classroom closet I get. Entering someone&#39;s private office I don&#39;t get. Would you just say, &quot;Hey, horny young people with bad judgement&quot; if you came home and two college students that you didn&#39;t know were screwing on your couch, having broken in your back door cause they were feeling horny and your house happened to be nearby when the lust struck them? I mean, jeezus. Plus telling someone to get out of their own office so you can *finish your coitus*? Wow. </p></span>

But the basic situation?  People have mentioned other places in which they wouldn&#39;t find this that surprising: the students, unlike Scott, probably didn&#39;t consider the office &quot;filled with departmental detritus&quot; to be an especially personal space, and I&#39;d guess they found the door open.  I mean, it makes a good story, but my shockedness that this might happen is at a similar level to Capt. Renault&#39;s.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/the_final_word_.html"><span><strong>The Final Word on Faith; or, The Place of Metal Plates in Religious Thought</strong> Anyone who knows me knows my opinion of religion runs in stride with that of Bill , er, William James . I admire the will to believe in the face of all logical obstacles to faith. But as someone once sort of said: &quot;Some faiths' fathers are bigger than other faiths' fathers.&quot; Close enough for government work. I understand the lure of tradition, the comfort of struggle, the intuition of order and all the many reasons faith survives in a world without reason. (I could discuss in great and grave detail the respect I have for the denizens of The Weblog via a discussion of God as omnipresent syncategorem to their otherwise secular propositions. Another night.) That said, to respond to unreasonable reality by spending $226 million etching science fiction novels from the fifties on stainless steel plates, wrapping those plates in Kevlar and burying them in bunkers smacks of untenable thought. Especially when those bunkers bear the symbol of The Church of Spiritual Technology. Unhinged from tradition, faith becomes a unsound enterprise productive of nothing other than unstable minds. While I cannot identify the precise moment when faith slips from struggle to suspect irrationality, I can say in no uncertain terms that once you consider etching Battlefield Earth on stainless steel plates to better bury them deep beneath the Nevada desert a fine idea, you've crossed the line.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/12/this_story_has_.html"><span><strong>This Story Has Legs; or, Implications In Flagrante</strong> I could've titled this entry &quot;I am become meme.&quot; Maybe I should've. &quot;I am become urban legend&quot; would've worked too. Point is I didn't realize the response to this tale would be so overwhelming. An amusing anecdote but little more. Now I want to say things like &quot;No more linking! Do you want to break the Internet?&quot; If my logs are any indication, the previous post spoke to vampires, goths, Canadians, bikers, Georgia Tech fans, athletic frogs, feminists and denizens of the reality based community. The transformation of my morning into an urban legend has already begun. Yesterday about seventy people from Cornell hit this site from their email server. The way my morning's been passed around I suspect that in a few months I'll get an email from a friend outside the academy with the contents of my post and a subject line like &quot;You HAVE to read this.&quot; Speaking of emails: Hundreds of people want to know whether I'm an actual academic who teaches at UCI. Snopes can wipe its brow. Google my name. Ask yourself whether the Scott Eric Kaufman at UCI who wrote Wednesday's post may be the same Scott Eric Kaufman at UCI whose (admittedly obsolete) homepage pops up fourth and blurbs &quot;Scott Eric Kaufman is in his 4th year in the Ph.D. program in English and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Irvine.&quot; Now look at the next hit from ratemyprofessors.com and ask yourself whether the Scott Eric Kaufman at UCI who wrote Wednesday's post may be the same Scott Eric Kaufman at UCI a former student once wrote &quot;rewards you with incredibly detailed feedback on articles and will help you work through your paper during office hours.&quot; See! Now you know that not only am an instructor at UCI but that I have office hours. Only one question remains: Is the Scott Eric Kaufman who teaches at UCI a liar? Some have suggested I am. (That's most recent, not necessarily the most representative example of this charge.) I don't know how to respond other than to point to examples of begrudging honesty on my part. Or you could verify other outlandish claims I've made . . . like time I said the Louisiana School for the Deaf is unfortunately acronymed. You could see whether Southern California experienced a minor earthquake on Sunday, October 16th. (It did.) You could snopes this site top to bottom and you'll see that I'm a responsible scholar already jeopardizing his career by blogging under his own name. Why would I want to further smudge my resume by lying? Short of wheeling out my student; linking to my course roster, scanning the article she came to office hours to discuss; posting a handwriting sample to compare to my scrawlings on her article and the Albert Lyter's densinometric analysis of the ink's age and composition . . . short of all that I think the odds of definitively proving that this happened slim. Because I can't stomach writing a...</span></a></div>
