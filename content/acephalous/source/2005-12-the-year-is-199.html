In other words, I go metaphysical.  </p>

<p>And I came of age in the midst of the disco era. I am so sorry that I cannot do better than that.  There just really isn&#39;t any &quot;there&quot; there.</p></span>

Someone had abused you mercilessly then left you to die. The shelter found you wandering around I-10 in 1992. They named you something dumb like &quot;Interstate&quot; or &quot;Highway.&quot; We adopted you and rechristened you Pokey. At first we thought you were a racist because you attacked the black architect who was working on our house. Later we learned that you hated men with mustaches regardless of race. We figured some mustachioed man had beaten and abandoned you. You wore a long leash your entire life because your favorite game was &quot;Almost Got Me.&quot; The door would open and you would bolt. We would run after you. You would stop to make sure we were chasing you and then when we were three feet away you would dart another half mile. You would always wait for us to catch up before you would bolt again. You didn't want to leave us. You only wanted to be chased. Once you ran into a stable and scared some horses and that was awesome. Eventually we decided to put a long leash around your neck so you could not dash so far so fast. We knew you loved the game but we did not want you to die playing it. You hated cats but you loved Tigger. There you are barking at a cat outside with Tigger riding shotgun. You did not know Tigger was a cat. We would think you were asleep and then all of the sudden we would be hit by the slobbery Tigger you had flung at us. We knew you wanted us to take him from you so you could growl and wrestle with him. We knew you loved Tigger so we decided not to tell you he was a cat. You were an awesome dog. When you developed canine epilepsy we discovered you loved cheese. You would only take your phenobarbital if we wrapped it in cheese and so we did. Then the seizures stopped and we were happy. Mom wanted to keep you alive so I could say goodbye this Christmas but you could not stop throwing up the cheese with your phenobarbital in it and started having seizures again. I know how selfish it sounds but I wanted to say goodbye and I wish you could have held out a little longer. I know you wanted to see me again and were sorry you could not. I know I wanted to see you again and am devestated I cannot. Mom and Dad were with you at the end so I know you felt safe and comfortable when you left us. I wish I had had a chance to say goodbye but I am glad you do not suffer anymore. You were the best dog ever.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/12/miriams_hrair_l.html"><span><strong>Miriam's Hrair Limit; or, How to Shelve Intelligently to Feel More Intelligent</strong> Miriam J. shared her edifying despair with Valve readers yesterday. I have had enough despair of late (and face the possibility of more tomorrow). So tonight I offer hope. But first a pinch of despair: I read on average 50 pages per hour. That’s around a book a day (life will intervene), 365 a year. If I squeeze out another 40 years, that’s a mere 14,600 books, which simply will not do. For every classic you haven’t read and should, there are at least five new books you’ll want to read as well. So says LA Times staff writer Susan Salter Reynolds. To which Miriam responds: My mortality is never closer than when I make the mistake of thinking too clearly about the ratio of the ever-burgeoning number of books in the world, to the sliver of books I have read or am yet likely to read. Miriam has a problem. She is unable to imagine how large a number 14,600 is. That's not surprising. Not because I think Miriam deficient, mind you, but because we all have our hrair limits . If following the link clarified little, &quot;hrair&quot; comes from Richard Adams' Watership Down and it means &quot;a number too large to count.&quot; In Adams' novel, the rabbits have a hrair of four. According George Miller's famous essay &quot;The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two,&quot; humans have a hrair of seven . . . plus or minus two. After you hit your hrair limit, not only can you will you be overwhelmed by any novel information, you will also lose the ability to understand the information you were already juggling. That's a damn fine metaphor: Some people can juggle five balls but not six. When someone tosses him a sixth, they all inevitably hit the floor. Other people can juggle six but not seven . . . you see where this is headed. Now consider Miriam's desperation. She will only read 14,600 hundred more books in her life. That statement is approximately 2085 times her hrair limit. She would need 2085 other brains to be able to wrap her mind around her absurd fear of not reading enough. Doesn't everyone feel better already? To strike a more serious note: this anxiety can be overcome by dispensing with the &quot;to read&quot; shelf and creating a &quot;have read&quot; shelf in its place. You will be amazed daily by how much you have read instead of despairing over how much you haven't. The sense of self-satisfaction such a shelf creates positively intoxicates.</span></a></div>
