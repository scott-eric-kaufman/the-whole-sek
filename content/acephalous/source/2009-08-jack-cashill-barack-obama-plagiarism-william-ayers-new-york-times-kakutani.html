Ayers knows his Homer. In his 2001 memoir, Fugitive Days, for instance, he specifically identified the Odyssey's &quot;Cyclops&quot; as a metaphor for the &quot;doomed and helpless&quot; United States. &quot;Picture an oversized, somewhat dim-witted monster, greedy and capricious,&quot; Ayers wrote in his uniquely patriotic way, &quot;its eyes put out by fiery stakes and now flailing in a blind rage, smashing its way through villages and over mountains.&quot; If, as Cashill hopes to establish, &quot;Ayers knows his Homer,&quot; it would behoove him not to quote Ayers saying that Odysseus put out the eyes of the famously one-eyed monster Polyphemus.

Once the sentence I quoted above is inserted back into its context, the parallels between Homer's epic and Obama's memoir become clear: In Dreams, Obama confronts his own menacing one-eyed bald man, a Savak-loving Iranian.

			<p>Jack Cashill, who received a Ph.D. in American Studies in 1982 then promptly forget everything he learned earning it, has returned with <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009/08/an_odd_coincidence.html">more evidence</a> that my assessment of him (&quot;<a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009/08/an_odd_coincidence.html">an idiot</a> of <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009/08/an_odd_coincidence.html">long-standing</a>&quot;) was correct.&#0160; He accuses Michiko Kakutani of plagiarizing his 2008 blockbuster, &quot;<a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2008/12/the_improvised_odyssey_of_bara.html">The Improvised Odyssey of Barack Obama</a>,&quot; and begins his defense of this claim as one does: by demonstrating that William Ayers is familiar with Homer&#39;s <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>

<blockquote>Ayers knows his Homer. In his 2001 memoir, <em>Fugitive Days</em>, for instance, he specifically identified the Odyssey&#39;s &quot;Cyclops&quot; as a metaphor for the &quot;doomed and helpless&quot; United States. &quot;Picture an oversized, somewhat dim-witted monster, greedy and capricious,&quot; Ayers wrote in his uniquely patriotic way, &quot;its eyes put out by fiery stakes and now flailing in a blind rage, smashing its way through villages and over mountains.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>In <em>Dreams</em>, Obama confronts his own menacing one-eyed bald man, a Savak-loving Iranian.</blockquote>

<p>Obama once spoke with a one-eyed man, Cashill argues, therefore this reference to a one-eyed cyclops in <em>Dreams From My Father</em> corresponds with Ayers&#39;s reference to a two-eyed one in <em>Fugitive Days</em>.&#0160; Granted, my summary of his point may be uncharitably literal, even though Obama&#39;s one-eyed man had, to all appearances, two eyes (&quot;an older balding man with a glass eye,&quot; the &quot;drift of [which] gave the Iranian a menacing look&quot;); and even though the point of Obama telling this story is that, despite one of the man&#39;s two eyes giving him &quot;a menacing look,&quot; he &quot;was a friendly and curious&quot; person; and even though, unlike the <em>Odyssey</em>, in which the curse of the one-eyed cyclops Polyphemus results in his father, Poseidon, to unleash contrary winds and furious storms, thereby extending the travels and travails of Odysseus, all that resulted from this conversation was that someone else quoted Malcolm X; even though all those parallels break down, maybe I am being uncharitably literal.&#0160; Once the sentence I quoted above is inserted back into its context, the parallels between Homer&#39;s epic and Obama&#39;s memoir become clear:</p>

Before he completes his heroic cycle, he also confronts many of the other distractions: green-eyed seductresses, blind seers, lotus-eaters, the &quot;ghosts&quot; of the underworld, whirlpools, and about a half dozen sundry &quot;demons.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Obama, as scripted by Ayers, lived the most Odysseus-esque life of anyone ever. I never even knew he went to the underworld!&#0160; But our President is even more Homeric than that because, in Cashill&#39;s estimation, Obama</p>

<blockquote>assumes the role of both Telemachus and Odysseus, the son seeking the father, and the father seeking home.</blockquote>

<p>This novel statement—no variation of which has appeared in the 2,800 year history of criticism on one of the foundational texts of the Western tradition—was later brazenly stolen by the chief literary critic of the <em>New York Times</em>:</p>

<blockquote>“Dreams From My Father,” written before [Obama] entered politics, was both a searching bildungsroman and an autobiographical quest to understand his roots—a quest in which he cast himself as both a Telemachus in search of his father and an Odysseus in search of a home.</blockquote>

<p>Kakutani should have known better than to borrow such a unique insight into the structure of the <em>Odyssey</em>.&#0160; Did she really think no one would notice her thievery if she included it as an afterthought to a sentence with which it bears an organic connection?&#0160; If Cashill&#39;s larger argument is correct—if, that is, &quot;Ayers leaves scarcely an Homeric trope unturned in his mining of the <em>Odyssey</em> to describe Obama&#39;s &#39;personal interior journey&#39;&quot;—then any literate person who reads both the <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Dreams From My Father</em> would pick up and comment upon the Homeric parallels, meaning his sentiment is too mundane to be plagiarized.&#0160; </p><p>Of course, Cashill&#39;s larger argument is <em>not</em> correct.&#0160; Just because Ayers and Obama both use words that relate to the sea (&quot;fog, mist, ships, seas, boats, oceans, calms, captains, charts, first mates, storms, streams, wind, waves, anchors, barges, horizons, ports, panoramas, moorings, tides, currents, and things howling, fluttering, knotted, ragged, tangled, and murky&quot;) doesn&#39;t mean that Ayers ghostwrote for Obama or that either are directly indebted to Homer.&#0160; Cashill predicates his complaint against Kakutani on her having stolen the substance of his argument while denying its conclusion.&#0160; She did nothing of the sort.&#0160; She tossed off a nifty parallel that fit organically within a larger framework; Cashill erected a larger framework in order to draw tendentious parallels between Circe and Diana Oughton on the grounds that she dated Obama for a year and lived in a nice neighborhood.</p><p><strong>UPDATE.</strong> It turns out I was wrong—Cashill’s claim that William Ayers wrote <em>Dreams From My Father</em> has been independently confirmed.

? Putting Cahill&#39;s hamfisted readings aside, then why does Ayers do such a number on Polyphemus? It&#39;s not only that P. has/d just the one eye, as you point out (get it?), but that he wasn&#39;t dimwitted, and didn&#39;t smash villages, since, as he and his fellows were primitives (representations of the Golden Age at its best and worst), there were no villages on his island. WTF? Ayers seems to have mistaken P. for a version of King Kong and Frankenstein&#39;s Monster, and Cahill clambers aboard for the ride.</p>

<p>You know who&#39;s greedy and capricious in the scene w/ Polyphemus? Freakin Odysseus, that&#39;s who. When I&#39;ve taught that episode, I&#39;ve always framed it as an episode confronting a central cultural difficulty (or at least a central difficulty in the Odyssey) in distinguishing between guests and pirates: to whom does one owe hospitality, and who should be killed? After all, O. repeatedly shows up, expects hospitality, and ravages what he finds, exactly like the guests wooing his wife. A good reader, then, should observe how Homer swings us around towards sympathy to P. and repugnance towards O. Sheesh.</p></span>

I decline, that is, to say that had I insisted on codifying my ideological commitments in a Senate bill a month before my passing, I would have done so because those commitments were so important to me in life that I wanted them to define my death. Because, in the end, giving one’s natural death to a cherished cause differs from dying for it only by dint of circumstance and timing: to accomplish with one’s death what one fought for in life is the wish of the true believer, and there is nothing untoward in that. But, as I said, there will be none of that. Instead, I will marvel at the stentorian stupidity of George H. Nash, who received a degree in History from Harvard in 1973 then promptly forget everything he learned earning it. To Nash, the death of Edward Kennedy represents an opportunity to bemoan “a disconcerting historical trend: the royalization of American politics.” Strangely, he does not begin his investigations with the many powerful branches of the Adams or Walker family trees (despite the former being the most prominent and the latter being the most recent). Instead, he claims that from Theodore Roosevelt to Franklin Roosevelt to the Kennedys and Camelot, American liberalism has repeatedly succumbed to this phenomenon. It begins in a cult of personality, extends to the leader’s wife and children, and then to a “court” of retainers and apologists. The royalists, then, are not the ones descended from the state representative of Massachusetts’s 7th district—they are the descendants of the impoverished Irish immigrant that man represented from 1849 to 1851. That bears repeating: the son-in-law of William Walker, Julius Rockwell, represented Patrick Kennedy in the U.S. House of Representatives from the moment Kennedy disembarked in 1849 until Rockwell resigned 1851 and the only worrisome political royalty Nash can locate here are the Kennedys? Granted, the family to whom he extends this cultish devotion is direct, “the leader’s wife and children,” so emphasis on the children of the Joseph Kennedy, Sr. is warranted: Joseph Jr., John, Robert and Edward are all direct descendants of a single powerful personage, as are the relatives in his other example, the pair of fifth cousins connected by a great-great-great-great-grandfather, Nicholas Van Rosenvelt, upon whose death in 1742 the family splintered into the Republican Oyster Bay and the Democratic Hyde Park Roosevelts. Wait—now I’m confused. Not only are the Roosevelts distant cousins instead of sons or brothers, they also belong to opposing factions of a family that’s been at political odds since before the Revolutionary War. How exactly are Republicans who voted for Theodore and Democrats who voted Franklin Delano symptomatic of American liberalism? Moreover, since Nash wants to talk about cults of personality extending to...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/08/the-content-of-a-eulogy-is-a-function-of-the-life-being-eulogized.html"><span><strong>The content of a eulogy is a function of the life being eulogized.</strong> After I linked to his post about Ted Kennedy’s funeral, Patrick asked what I’d think were the grandchild of a hypothetical conservative to say this at the funeral: Dear God, for what my grandpa called the causes of his life, the privatization of social security and the construction a robust missile defense shield, we pray to the Lord. My response, as indicated by the title, is that funerals are about the lives of the deceased, and if the deceased was a Senator who devoted his life to privatizing social security and constructing a robust missile defense shield, I’d have no problem with those issues being raised at his funeral. But it would sound tacky, not because I disagree with those policy initiatives, but because this hypothetical conservative dedicated his life to wonky policy initiatives. Were those initiatives less wonky, the prayer would sound less tacky. Consider: Dear God, for what my grandpa called the cause of his life, the eradication of hunger in Africa, we pray to the Lord. When prayed for, big and noble causes sound big and noble. So, too, do some specific issues concerning otherwise wonky initiatives. Consider: Dear God, for what my grandpa called the cause of his life, the preservation of the Santa Ana sucker fish habitat, we pray to the Lord. Praying for the preservation of a land and species to which the deceased felt great affinity sounds respectable, if a bit silly, because of our reverence for outdoorsmen like Henry David Thoreau and John Muir, who are themselves respectable, if a bit silly. The more wonkish the issue to which the deceased committed his life, the more likely it is that intercessionary prayers on his or her behalf will sound tacky. But as it was the deceased who chose to devote his or her life to an issue that will make for some tacky intercessionary prayers, the living can do precious little if they wish to remain respectable. If I spent my life rewriting the tax code, and if, on my deathbed, the rewriting of the tax code was imminent, I would hope that my relatives thought enough of me to say a prayer on my behalf that represented my fondest desire at my funeral. It would sound tacky, but so what? My funeral should be about me, my life, my accomplishments, and my dreams, and if I wore a grey flannel suit, amended the tax code around the edges, and dreamt of a complete overhaul, I would hope that my friends and family would mention it, what with it having been so important to me. Finally, to those who claim that no Republican would ever use someone’s funeral as a platform to forward their own agenda, I remind them of the law and order politicking of Nixon at J. Edgar Hoover’s funeral: The profound principles associated with his name will not fade away. Rather, I would predict that in the time ahead those principles of respect for law, order, and justice will...</span></a></div>
