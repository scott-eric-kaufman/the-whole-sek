Surely, however, the calluses thing has nothing to do with race in a supposedly biological sense and everything to do with race in a social sense: a Southern white woman presumably would never engage in the sort of labor that would prduce calluses on her hands, where an enslaved woman would as a matter of course.  I don&#39;t understand where fingerprints come into it, but I have the general feeling that I&#39;m missing something here.</p></span>

Maybe one of Frances Harper&#39;s novels? I don&#39;t remember anything of the sort in Harriet Jacobs&#39;s _Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl._ (Although ... I do remember something about her dressing as a &quot;Spanish&quot; youth and almost getting caught because she was so pretty. Or am I totally making that up?)</p>

<p>Is there maybe a story of Harriet Tubman that you&#39;re referencing here? She often cross-dressed to escape detection. </p>

<p>Any other details or time period stuff we could go on?</p></span>

<p>I agree with Scott that the discussion of heredity and fingerprints is odd, in context, and with JPool that it&#39;s probably a mistake. I can&#39;t find anything in Ebsco, either.</p>

<p>Can you give us the reference you&#39;re following up on? </p></span>

The science of fingerprints must have been pretty novel at the time (the first successful prosecution based on fingerprints in England wasn&#39;t until 1902, apparently - I think the very first was actually in India a few years earlier than that?), so it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if late 19th-century writers had some odd ideas about it.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-110655150-content"><p>First, I&#39;d like to thank everyone for the help.  If nothing else, I don&#39;t feel bone stupid anymore.  (As I would&#39;ve if it&#39;d been in, say, Frederick Douglas.)</p>

<p>JPool:</p>

<p><em>I don&#39;t know the slave narrative to which you&#39;re referring, and indeed was unaware of one in which the protagonist tries to pass for white. Surely, however, the calluses thing has nothing to do with race in a supposedly biological sense and everything to do with race in a social sense: a Southern white woman presumably would never engage in the sort of labor that would prduce calluses on her hands, where an enslaved woman would as a matter of course. I don&#39;t understand where fingerprints come into it, but I have the general feeling that I&#39;m missing something here.</em></p>

<p>Passing for white was a common way for &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_yellow" rel="nofollow">high yellow</a>&quot; blacks to make it North once they struck territory where they wouldn&#39;t know anyone.  And yes, you&#39;re right that there&#39;s a social element: an upper-class woman wouldn&#39;t have callused hands.  This would be a good time to quote the relevant (and rough) passages from the chapter:</p>

<blockquote>[Galton] begins “Race and Class” with a simple, direct statement of observed fact: “There is no particular pattern that is special to any one [people], which when met with enables to assert, or even to suspect, the nationality of the person on whom it appeared” (193).  Yet three pages later he notes “the general clumsiness of [Negroes’] fingers,” although he admits this observation may “be from pure on my part.”  Nevertheless, he concludes by stating that the “width of the ridges seems more uniform, their intervals more regular, and their courses more parallel than with us.  In short, they give an idea of greater simplicity, due to causes that I have not yet succeeded in submitting to the test of measurement” (196).  The final admission of ignorance underscores the problem with his approach: he actively seeks evidence to confirm his belief that “the general aspect of the Negro print” accords with his impression of the general aspect of the Negro (196).  Despite finding no discernible difference between the prints of one race or another, he insists his inability to find measurable distinctions in the manner of the folds and creases of the fingers and hands is a product of his own shortcomings.  Without meaning to, Galton advocates a form of palmistry here, one bound to the future of the race instead of the individual.  His argument is specious, but its appeal to Galton’s own authority as an expert in the subject of print analysis is powerful.  Even those reviewers who thought he “devotes his life to the elucidation of the queer and the curious” and is “carried away by his enthusiasms” remind readers of Galton’s status as “an expert having uncommon powers of observation” (“Mr. Galton on Finger Prints” 19).  To readers unfamiliar with the array of statistical evidence Galton presents, his hunches about the racial typology visible to (if not measurable by) his expert eyes carry the weight of fact.  Race is only the first of two forces countering the radical individuality of human fingerprints.  The other would be class.

<p>Galton’s list of forces working to alter or obliterate fingerprints is not discussed in the chapter on “Race and Class,” as might be expected, but in an earlier chapter on “The Ridges and Their Uses.”  He notes that they are “but faintly developed in the hands of ladies, rendered delicate by the continual use of gloves and lack of manual labour, and in idiots of the lowest type who are incapable of labouring at all.”  They are destroyed “by the callosities formed on the hands of labourers and artisans in many trades, by the constant pressures of their peculiar tools.”  Injuries leaving permanent scars obscure the ridges, and if “a piece of flesh is sliced off, or if an ulcer has eaten so deeply as to obliterate the perspiratory glands, a white cicatrix, without pores or ridges, is the result” (59).  Much as he would like to convince himself otherwise, they do not, as he claimed, “have the unique merit of retaining all their peculiarities unchanged throughout life” (2).  By his own admission, they can be destroyed through normal circumstance: a life of labor or a household accident can alter the immutable.  Galton would insist that he speaks of the pattern of the print, a pattern which “grows simultaneously with its fatness, leanness, usage, gouty deformation, or age” and that while “as a whole [it] may become considerably altered in length or breadth, the number of ridges, their embranchments, and other minutiae remain unchanged” (98).  He compares the print to a piece of lace which may be grossly stretched or shrunk, but never does he consider that it may be torn.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Where I&#39;m headed with this, then, is the conflict caused by his implicit, because unprovable, racial essentialism and its effect on Twain&#39;s narrative.  </p>

<p>Susie:</p>

<p><em>Any other details or time period stuff we could go on?</em></p>

<p>In my mind, she&#39;s caught on the road by slavers looking for someone else.  I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s pre-Civil War, but that it remained popular afterwards.  (I don&#39;t have Twain&#39;s letters anymore, hate the person who recalled them <em>and</em> the fact that they&#39;re not all online yet.) The narrative itself doesn&#39;t have anything to do with fingerprints, it&#39;s just the connection I want to draw between race/class in the Twain. </p>

<p>Greg:</p>

<p><em>The story could be somewhere there, perhaps?</em></p>

<p>I went through my Brown and didn&#39;t see it there.  (I distinctly remember marking the passage somehow or another.  Ugh, but do I hate myself and my faulty memory sometime.  I was up most of the night spinning my wheels on this one.  But I can&#39;t find the book, file, or my notes, yet I <em>know</em> it&#39;s out there somewhere.)</p>

<p>EDIT: As I said, very tired and didn&#39;t refresh before commenting, so I didn&#39;t see the other comments.  More after napping.  (And let me reiterate my thanks to all who&#39;ve tried to help rectify my mortifying stupidity.)</p></span>

As in: &quot;What surprises you when he talks is how articulate this young man is. You just don't expect it.&quot; &quot;You're telling me this kid skipped college? I know college graduates who aren't half as well-spoken.&quot; &quot;The thing you have to love about Wright is that he's always smiling that big smile of his. He's always happy to doing his job.&quot; Does everyone looks black when you come from Wisconsin? I'm reminded of a passage from Chesnutt's The Marrow of Tradition (1901): In order to give the visitors, ere they left Wellington New York, a pleasing impression of Southern Eastern customs, and particularly of the joyous, happy-go-lucky disposition of the Southern Eastern darky and his entire contentment with existing conditions, it was decided by the hotel management to treat them, on the last night of their visit, to a little diversion, in the shape of a genuine negro cakewalk baseball game.</span></a></div>

The settlement's neither on behalf of nor against the Ottoman Empire. The culprit is the insurance company New York Life, but its legal and press teams thought it best to name the settlement after the Ottomans. New York Life merely refused to disburse life-insurance payments to the families of the 2,400 NYL policy-holders killed in the Armenian Genocide. Who would want to claim &quot;New York Life Insists It Need Not Honor Policies Purchased By The Victims Of Genocide Settlement Payments&quot; when they could appear imperial? Certainly not this California tax-payer.</span></a></div>
