Brent Bozell, of the ironically named “Media Research Center,” who refuted Oliver Stone’s comment that “Nixon always said Reagan was a dumb son of a bitch” by quoting a number of prominent figures in Reagan’s administration who thought Reagan was really smart: I turned to Frank Donatelli, the White House Political Director under President Reagan from 1987 through 1989 . . .

So Bozell was wrong, Stone never claimed to be an historian, but that doesn’t mean Bozell wasn’t also right: You are an historian whether you believe it or not. You make films about history and historical figures. You record history, and that makes you an historian. Now that Bozell, through the cunning use of italics, has transformed Stone into an historian, he can finally slam him good and proper: Being an historian is not the problem. It’s that you’re a lousy historian. In short, Stone isn’t what he never claimed to be, but is what Bozell says he is, and a lousy one at that. The evidence: “Nixon always said Reagan was a dumb son of a bitch,” you said, and the audience laughed, and you smiled and decided to take that statement further by agreeing with it. So you said, “You know, I think that he was,” and the audience now cheered and hooted and applauded. See what I mean when I say you’re a lousy historian? There are two claims being made here: one, that Nixon thought Reagan was a dumb son of a bitch; two, that Oliver Stone thinks Reagan was a dumb son of a bitch. Unfortunately for Bozell, Nixon illegally taped every conversation he ever had, and when we consult his conversations with Henry Kissenger on the morning of November 17, 1971 [620a.mp3], we learn that while Nixon didn’t use those exact words—about Reagan, at least, since we know he used that particular phrase about everyone from the Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, to the Director of the Secret Service, James Rowley, to one of his own White House aides, Tom Charles Huston—he..." />

			<p>. . . <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/brent-bozell/2009/07/03/bozell-column-oliver-stone-lousy-historian">Brent Bozell</a>, of the ironically named “<a href="http://www.mrc.org/public/default.aspx">Media Research Center</a>,”
who refuted Oliver Stone’s comment that “Nixon always said Reagan was a
dumb son of a bitch” by quoting a number of prominent figures in
Reagan’s administration who thought Reagan was really smart:
</p><blockquote><p>I turned to Frank Donatelli, the White House Political
Director under President Reagan from 1987 through 1989 . . . Richard
Allen, Reagan’s National Security Advisor . . . [and] Gary Bauer[, the]
Domestic Policy Advisor under the Gipper for two years[.]</p></blockquote>
<p>All of them agreed that real “dumb son of a bitch” was Stone,
who—according Bozell in a letter addressed to Stone—is an historian
because he once claimed to be:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some producer [of Comedy Central&#39;s <em>Politically Incorrect</em>]
really thought in extremes when they pitted Oliver Stone and Brent
Bozell for one episode. I have to say that you were gracious, charming,
engaging, and we enjoyed ourselves—except for that moment when I
chastised you for claiming you’re an historian. You bristled and denied
ever claming that moniker. I cited the source, an interview in some
West Coast paper (I can’t recall which one now).</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though Bozell can’t remember the name of the paper, he somehow managed to re-read the article later and</p>
<blockquote><p>[i]t turns out that you were right (in the article) and I was wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Bozell was wrong, Stone never claimed to be an historian, but that doesn’t mean Bozell wasn’t also right:</p>
<blockquote><p>You <em>are</em> an historian whether you believe it or
not. You make films about history and historical figures. You record
history, and that makes you an historian.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that Bozell, through the cunning use of italics, has transformed
Stone into an historian, he can finally slam him good and proper:</p>
<blockquote><p>Being an historian is not the problem. It’s that you’re a lousy historian.</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, Stone isn’t what he never claimed to be, but is what Bozell says he is, and a lousy one at that.&#0160; The evidence:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Nixon always said Reagan was a dumb son of a bitch,”
you said, and the audience laughed, and you smiled and decided to take
that statement further by agreeing with it. So you said, “You know, I
think that he was,” and the audience now cheered and hooted and
applauded.</p>
<p>See what I mean when I say you’re a lousy historian?</p></blockquote>
<p>There are two claims being made here: <strong>one</strong>, that Nixon thought Reagan was a dumb son of a bitch; <strong>two</strong>,
that Oliver Stone thinks Reagan was a dumb son of a bitch.
Unfortunately for Bozell, Nixon illegally taped every conversation he
ever had, and when we consult <a href="http://nixontapes.org/chron2.htm">his conversations with Henry Kissenger on the morning of November 17, 1971</a> [<a href="http://nixontapeaudio.org/chron2/rmn_e620a.mp3">620a.mp3</a>],
we learn that while Nixon didn’t use those exact words—about Reagan, at
least, since we know he used that particular phrase about everyone from
the Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, to the Director of the
Secret Service, James Rowley, to one of his own White House aides, Tom
Charles Huston—he didn’t think too highly of the Gipper’s wits:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>(beginning at 1:33:02)</strong></p>
<p><strong>President Nixon:</strong> What’s your evaluation or Reagan after meeting him several times now.</p>
<p><strong>Kissinger:</strong> Well, I think he’s a—actually I think he’s a pretty decent guy.</p>
<p><strong>President Nixon:</strong> Oh, decent, no question, but his brains?</p>
<p><strong>Kissinger:</strong> Well, his brains are negligible. I—</p>
<p><strong>President Nixon:</strong> He’s really pretty shallow, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>Kissinger:</strong> He’s shallow. He’s got no . . . he’s an
actor. He—When he gets a line he does it very well. He said, “Hell,
people are remembered not for what they do, but for what they say.
Can’t you find a few good lines?” That’s really an actor’s approach to
foreign policy . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Admittedly, Kissinger lands the harder blows, but Nixon obviously
agrees with him, so we can say with certainty that Nixon thinks
Reagan’s “brains are neglible” and that he’s “really pretty shallow.”
That’s not <em>quite</em> “dumb son of a bitch,” but it’s close. If only that tape continued . . .</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>(beginning at 1:46:19)</strong></p>
<p><strong>President Nixon:</strong> Back to Reagan though. It shows
you how a man of limited mental capacity simply doesn’t know what the
Christ is going on in the foreign area. He’s got to know that on
defense—doesn’t he know these battles we fight and fight and fight?
Goddamn it, Henry, we’ve been at—</p></blockquote>
<p>Does calling Reagan “a man of limited mental capacity” amount to
saying he’s a “dumb son of bitch”? Oliver Stone seems to think so, and
I’m inclined to agree. So, as to the first claim, Bozell is clearly the
lousy historian here.</p>
<p>As to the second claim—that Oliver Stone thinks Reagan was a dumb son of a bitch—given that Bozell spends the majority of <em>a letter addressed to Stone</em>
trying to prove that Reagan was the second coming of Thomas Aquinas,
he’s not well-positioned to argue that Stone doesn’t think Reagan was a
dumb son of a bitch.</p>
<p>In other words, the person who misremembered what Stone said in an article somewhere, but doesn’t remember where, who then <em>re-read</em> the article from he-doesn’t-remember-where <em>and promptly forgot where it was again</em>—this person thinks Stone is a lousy historian because he <em>correctly</em> cited Nixon’s sentiments about Reagan and <em>correctly</em>
stated that he agreed with Nixon’s assessment. If I were Bozell—and
could remember that I was Bozell long enough to cite myself—I wouldn’t
be knocking people who don’t claim to be historians for being lousy
historians when those same tables could so easily be turned on, say, a “<a href="http://www.mrc.org/bios/lbb/welcome.asp">lecturer, syndicated columnist, television commentator, debater, marketer, businessman, author, publisher and activist</a>” who fancies himself qualified to judge who is and isn’t “a real [historian].”</p><p>(<em><a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/and-the-award-for-missing-the-point-goes-to/">x-posted</a></em>.)</p>

Not content to let Bozell hold the award for long, loyalcon manages to bafflingly miss the point in a comment on <i>a post about missing the point</i> by miraculously <i>failing to even read the link he provides as damning evidence</i>.<br />
A daring move.</p>

<p>In another note, &quot;sack of ***&quot; really amused me because I can only interpret it to be &quot;sack of ass&quot;.</p></span>

Despite being corrected by commenters and despite the fact that a post with all the information needed to correct his misunderstanding could be found directly under the post he commented on, he persists in error!  It&#39;s even ambiguous whether he understands that SEK and Kauffman are the same person!  If he&#39;s not reading the things he links to, or the things he comments on, ladies and gentlemen, what does he read?

It seems instead that he speaking from a bafflingly comprehensive position of ignorance as to what is going on, or what the people he&#39;s talking to/about are saying.  His silence seems to imply that he&#39;s either caught on and left in shame, or gotten frustrated with how the people around him seem to be speaking nonsense.<br />
I&#39;ve noticed that the latter happens a lot more often than the former on the internet.  It&#39;s like that joke about the guy who gets a call from his wife telling him to be careful because someone&#39;s driving the wrong way on the highway, to which he replies &quot;it&#39;s worse than that, there are hundreds of them!&quot;<br />
When you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in a situation, but you think you do, it can sometimes appear, very convincingly, like everyone around you has no idea what they&#39;re talking about.</p></span>

On an unrelated note, I'm not sure whether the Google Image results for this blog are representative or insulting, but they certainly are something.</span></a></div>

We are advancing in another direction.”* Of course, given the depth of Palin’s erudition—like Reagan, she’s “dumb as a fox” to those who watch her press conferences on mute—it should surprise no one that she grabbed the first patriotic-sounding quotation about “advancing” that Google returned and tacked it onto her speech. This is what passes for knowledge among some conservatives: the ability to quote-mine the internet for something that sounds patriotic. (Google may not be making us stupid, but the same cannot be said for many of them.) Because their paragon of intellectual achievement is a woman who cannot remember what newspapers she reads every day, it is only fitting that Palin’s last words on the national stage—intended to demonstrate that the “easy path” in life paradoxically involves “plod[ding] along” by “sit[ting] down and shut[ting] up,” because everyone knows that “a quitter’s way” is one of perseverance in the face of adversity—should be a misattributed misquotation ripped from its context in a way that conservatives would, under normal circumstances, consider insulting. In attributing the quotation to General MacArthur, she is disrespecting the life and service of the man who actually spoke something similar to those words; and in analogizing her plight to that of the men who served under the General she disrespected, she is belittling the memory of their sacrifice. In the winter of 1950, General Oliver Prince Smith and his 1st Marine Division were ordered to march north to the Yalu River, on the border between China and Korea. The order was given by Major General Edward “Ned” Almond, an obsequious lackey with an ego to rival Patton’s who functioned as “MacArthur’s MacArthur [by taking] MacArthur’s vision of what was supposed to happen and [bringing] it directly to Korea, where he employed it, whether it fitted the Korean reality or not” (The Coldest Winter 163). Smith, called “Professor” for his deliberate manner and attention to detail, surveyed the land and determined that the Korean reality didn’t fit MacArthur and Almond’s vision at all, and though he obeyed the command to press north, he did so in a manner that befitted his nickname: General Almond had already begun to notice that the spearhead was hardly moving at all. We were in fact just poking along—deliberately so. We pulled every trick in the book to slow down our advance, hoping the enemy would show his hand before we got more widely dispersed than we already were. At the same time we were building up our levels of supply at selected dumps along the way. (432) When the Chinese attacked the 1st Marine Division (19,000 soldiers) with six divisions (60,000 soliders) of its own in the Chosin River Basin, Smith and his soldiers were prepared: by day, they would avoid the roads by moving south through the mountainous terrain, shelling the advancing Chinese from the high ground;...</span></a></div>
