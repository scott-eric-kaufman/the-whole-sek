Forget I even mentioned them. Because as I went about my browsing business tonight I checked out Scott McLemee's latest Intellectual Affairs column and found the following: The next gathering, also for lunch, took place a week later, during the convention of the Modern Language Association. Looking around the table, I drew up a quick census. One guest worked on British novels of the Victorian era. Another writes about contemporary postcolonial fiction and poetry. We had two Americanists, but of somewhat different specialist species; besides, one was a tenured professor, while the other is just starting his dissertation. And, finally, there was, once again, a philosopher. (Actually it was the same philosopher, visiting from Singapore and in town for a while.) Guess which one is me? A few unnecessary hints: I'm not a Victorianist. I don't work on postcolonial fiction and poetry. I'm not tenured. I don't live in Singapore. I'm an Americanist. So which one am I? And can you guess what kind of burrito-wrap-thingy I ordered? I'll give you a hint: It's named after a character in Clue who is himself named after a condiment. Am I mysterious or what? (The answer's obviously &quot;or what.&quot; But read Scott's column. It communicates more eloquently than I've been able to mustard the sense of immediate connection and community blogging fostered at the MLA this past December.)</span></a></div>

My Navel, World.</strong> Looking over what I've written these past many months I notice I've fallen into a comfortable rut of public consumables and quasi-private communications. A canny manipulator would claim this had been the plan all along: you come for the satire and general vituperation but stay for the desperate pleas of a random but individualized dissertator. Tonight I embrace the oscillation: Earlier Adam confessed he &quot;sometimes gets sick of listening to music all the time.&quot; I'll match his confession with one of my own: I never listen to music anymore. Not really. When I cook. Or do the dishes. Or have the radio on in the car. Or when it cheaply manipulates my emotions while watching something. (I'm looking at you, Mr. Braff .) I still want to listen to music . . . only I find it difficult to find the right accompaniment to what I'm reading or writing. Once upon a time I could pair my literature with my music with ease. I would read Thomas Pynchon and listen to Lotion or couple James Joyce and The Levellers . A perfect fit? The Pynchon truly truly. The Joyce and every other novel I read and every other band I obsessed over were paired according to a logic predicated on nothing more than Kaufmanian contiguity. I read X while listening to Y and the two are now bound by Krazy Glue in my memory. Since I don't make many memories anymore which don't involve my desk and books and chair and daily writing routine I no longer create even random associations. In its place I become slave to a tune. What tune? Whichever one stuck in my head while I cooked or washed dishes or drove somewhere or watched something. If my iPod could do more than tamp down Adam's manuscript I wouldn't be in this mess. But it has lost the will to play. So I'm stuck with random hooks setting up house in my head. Or doing dishing constantly. Or having the gorgeous soundtrack to Battlestar Galictica on heavy rotation. (Were it not for the artificial drama it adds to the most mundane activities—Can he finish morning ablution before that Cylon RIGHT BEHIND HIM strikes!—I probably would. Who wouldn't want to listen the Gayatri Mantra in Sanskrit all the time? Especially when so beautifully rendered. But still.) The only alternative is to interrupt my vigorous wall-staring with the latest Wilco . . . but that would lead to some unwholesome associations. Who wants to associate breathtaking music with the suffocation of dissertating? I certainly don't. But what choice do I have? Blog under musical influence? If I listen while I blog my sense of my words will be scattered by the lyrics in my head. I have a quiet style any accompaniment will ruin. (Stop laughing. I do too have a quiet style.) I know the real solution is to find appropriate music for writing about S.W. Mitchell and evolutionarily-influenced historical romances about the Revolutionary War. I don't...</span></a></div>
