		<span id="comment-28081180-content"><p>Depends.  Have you ever read James before?  To my mind, the best place to start are with the mid-period stories, collected <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1883011647/diesekoschmar-20" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  Not too much of a commitment, but capture the Jamesian style before it becomes overly ornate.  A warning, though: I&#39;m not a fan of late James, which, to my ears, bears the marks of its dictation.  So, as you might expect, I&#39;m a fan of the mid-period novels, too, my favorite being <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/014043254X/diesekoschmar-20" rel="nofollow"><i>The Princess Casimassima</i></a>.  The latest one I was somehow able to enjoy was <i>Wings of the Dove</i>, so technically, <i>The Sacred Fount</i> shouldn&#39;t be all that bad; but I remember not liking it that much.  Others will, no doubt, disagree.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-28095553-content"><p>Thank you for the suggestions, I&#39;ve read <i>Daisy Miller</i> and remembered being annoyed by how precious and, as you put it, ornate the whole story was; however the aforementioned book and <i>The Ambassadors</i> seem like prime candidates for some careful reading in my case, provided I don&#39;t fall asleep or stare at the page thinking of how many ways I can kill a man.

Maybe I should. Last week you bought me High Society and the first volume of Church &amp; State. Did I thank you? I did not. And the week before, when you helped me better understand William James' theory of emotion? Did I show my gratitude? I did not. I was too busy ... looking ridiculous. (Sort of like the &quot;avidmarxist&quot; standing in for me, only much more so.) This week many of you have helped me &quot;find a form to accommodate the mess.&quot; What have I done? Thanked you privately and, now, publicly. I have been revising it per your recommendations all week now, and I'll continue to do so most of the weekend. Those of you who missed out on accommodating that mess need not worry. I'll be imposing on you on any day now.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/01/one_reason_for_.html"><span><strong>Historicism, Slapped on the Wrist, then Around, only to be Reminded, via Pleas, Tears, How much It Is Loved</strong> One reason for theory's former ubiquity was that it sped up the researching and writing processes. No longer would a literary scholar have to read 70 novels to write a publishable article; 10 would suffice, so long as one had the applicable theory in hand. Thus was born a vicious cycle: because it didn't take as long to write an article, departments raised the standards of how many articles were required for tenure; and if more articles could be produced, more full-length monographs could, too. Theory's not responsible for this acceleration, but it's certainly complicit in it. The problem for scholars working now—in The Age of Historicism—is that they're working now, in The Age of Historicism. Theory is not what it once was; journals and publishers are demanding articles and books with a depth commensurate to pre-theory articles and books. The problem is, the codified acceleration of graduate and departmental standards have made it almost impossible for young scholars to produce such work. Reading seventy novels, hundreds of short stories, the relevant critical literature—reading that much takes time young scholars don't have. So they continue to produce theory-heavy scholarship which, unsurprisingly, hits the water with nary a splash and vanishes from sight. This problem is an exaggeration of an endemic institutional inequity, normally not worth the energy it takes to complain; however, the longer I work on my dissertation, the more I retrace the steps of my research and realize which tangents I shouldn't have taken, which shortcuts enable me to produce quality work quickly—the more I recognize how steep the dissertation-learning curve is, the more forcefully this particular institutional inefficiency chafes my notions of common sense and fair play. Not that this has anything to do with me personally, or the progress of my dissertation, except that it does. As I struggle to finish, I know that it would be in my best interest to invest myself completely in a single, overriding theory and ride it into the market. What's stopping me? For one, an honest assessment of my own work, one which recognizes my strengths—close-reading based on Himalayas of research—and weaknesses—brazen assertions about the validity of this or that to something or another. Will I ever, I wonder, produce something which meets my own standards? Or will I be coerced by market-forces into creating a substandard monstrosity of a dissertation, which I'll follow with a parade of inadequately researched articles unacceptable at even the most mediocre journals? Will The Other Henry James Review and Even More Postmodern Culture reject me? Could I live with myself if they did?</span></a></div>
