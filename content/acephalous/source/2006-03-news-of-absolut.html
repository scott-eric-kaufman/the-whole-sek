<p>I&#39;ve just personally spent the entire day revising and re-revising *two paragraphs*.  Mind you, these two paragraphs seem to have spawned their own cottage industry of footnotes along the way - but hey, if every word doesn&#39;t have its personal annotated qualification, someone might conceivably miss the fact that I am completely and hopelessly OCD about my academic work - and we wouldn&#39;t want to leave them with a shadow of doubt about this, given that I&#39;m writing this paper to circulate to someone who will be considering hiring me in a few weeks...</p></span>

<p>Irvine has a heart?</p>

<p>I say that with love.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve grown to like footnotes, but I still hate the legal citation rules for &quot;supra this&quot; and &quot;but cf that.&quot;  I tend to let things go when I hit &quot;submit,&quot; praying that the student editors of the various law journals will be scarcely better readers than I am a writer. Once an article is accepted, months of revision will follow even if I turn in my &quot;final&quot; draft. I was a student articles editor--it&#39;s no fun trying to tell a professor that s/he&#39;s grammatically incorrect. Professors tend to resist statements of authority by 24 year old law students. I imagine it will be less fun to be told so when I become a professor. </p>

<p>You unfortunate fools with your well-respected peer-edited journals.  If your journals were student-edited like law reviews are (weird, huh!), you could just blame people like me and your nagging fears could be assuaged. Just pass the buck!</p>

<p>I&#39;m feeling a mite better, so I thought I&#39;d drop by. Apparently, you, AW and I are all sick. I think there&#39;s a conspiracy afoot to spread germs through cyberspace.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-15673409-content"><p>A major source of my income during college was proofreading, and a fair amount of that was for 50-something professors.  I could generally sell the strictly grammatical suggestions - you could always save face for them by saying things like, &quot;Oh, I *always* do *that* when I&#39;m in a hurry too&quot;, etc.  The bigger problem  was when you felt there was something fundamentally wrong with the structure of a paragraph or article - then you took your life into your own hands...  </p>

<p>I had one regular proofreading client who, when we got to this stage, would always lash out with the most bizarre, psychoanalytically charged invectives about my subterranean hostility that drove me to invent problems with his text to undermine his self-confidence and sabtoage his academic career.  And then he&#39;d come back the next week as though none of this had happened, and ask what I thought of the changes...</p>

<p>But I have a disproportionate love of footnotes, as well - they provide a means of expressing all variety of associations that occur while I&#39;m writing, serve as capsule descriptions of things I might write in the future, and talk to a wide range of audiences other than the one I&#39;m addressing in the main piece.  And I don&#39;t feel the need to be as obsessively strict with them as I do with my main text - so they can meander around a bit and use an associative structure that I would always edit out of my main draft, but that it always easier for me to write...</p></span>

[UPDATED!] [AND AGAIN!]</strong> I normally avoid writing about such trivial stuff, but in addition to garden variety exhaustion I'm now running a fever. So the little things are getting to me. Like spam whose intention I can't fathom. I understand penis-enlargement spam. Plays off insecurities. Contains links to penis-enlargement pills. Makes sense. Weight-loss spam? Makes sense. Car insurance spam? Makes sense. &quot;Beaver in disloyalty kisses the drizzle's price&quot; spam? &quot;Beaver in disloyalty kisses the drizzle's price&quot; is all the email says. That's it. No link. Nothing. There's a point to the pointless of &quot;Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.&quot; Why would someone named &quot;point man&quot; want me to know what happens to those who are &quot;beaver&quot; in their disloyalty? Why would somone who is want to kiss &quot;the drizzle's price&quot;? Who is The Drizzle? What is his price? Do I only have to pay to kiss it if I'm beaver in disloyalty? Or is &quot;kissing the drizzle's price&quot; a euphemism for the dire fate of those who are beaver in their disloyalty? Maybe this is some sort of test. Maybe &quot;point man&quot; wants to know whether I'm beaver in disloyalty. Maybe this post proves that I am. Maybe it proves that I'm not. Hard to tell. [UPDATE: Since posting this I have received another email--this one from &quot;morgan bridges&quot; who wants me to know more about &quot;fanaticism dry cleaners.&quot; What more? &quot;Bash and nobody glimmers in the bridle of the creator.&quot;] [UPDATE II: Now &quot;harriot trent&quot; informs me of &quot;my raise.&quot; In the interest of fun I will render it in free verse form: shift. flap unwanted unmoved in the animated disruption. lip to! the quietness drifts heroic, too residual to adjourn, to subscribe to a lantern of estimation. the merry-go-round of influenza punctures all odd-jobs. catnap contentment, the soap opera errand. the sigh to commemorate what was Catholic, as the octopi gather verification to vandalize the &quot;v&quot; with illumination. I'm tempted to say that &quot;harriot trent&quot; is really Rich winding me up. Some of that's too evocative to be truly random.]</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/temporary_comme.html"><span><strong>Temporary Comment Section for &quot;The Best Introduction To . . . &quot;</strong> Updated! [Please see this post for the updated version of the list.] It all started when I was an undergraduate. One morning I woke up and decided to read a general history of every single American state. I made it through four or five before tiring of the genre. At the time I wish I had a list of the best history of each state. I asked a history professor of mine if such a list existed and was informed that not only did no list exist, but that the labor required to create one would boggled his imagination. Needless to say, all of this happened when the WWW was in its infancy and blogs but a twinkle in its eye. I thought perhaps I could cull a decent one from Wikipedia entries, but a cursory examination of topics upon which I have some expertise revealed that those references are of dubious quality. Then I thought: I can start a movement. So I sent Ralph an email about the state history project. (About ten minutes ago. Some nerve he has, not replying yet.) But I can start a little something here. My choice of both category and best book concerning it is intended as a way to begin the discussion. I can only work with what I've read. (Some areas I've read around in but can't think of a qualifier for &quot;best introduction.&quot;) This project has the possibility to demonstrate the real strength of the distributive intelligence review process. Please suggest additional categories and alternative selections, as my list is no way authoritative or exhaustive. I also want to avoid &quot;representative&quot; works, i.e. the best introduction to psychoanalysis being The Interpretation of Dreams. I want books which cover a wider swath than a single work by a representative figure can. Note: All categories and/or periods contain all the problems inherent to categorization and periodization. I also imagine that there must be a better way to organize this list, as this somewhat chronological organization seems unwieldy. I expect many edits to both the body of this post and the substance of the list.
