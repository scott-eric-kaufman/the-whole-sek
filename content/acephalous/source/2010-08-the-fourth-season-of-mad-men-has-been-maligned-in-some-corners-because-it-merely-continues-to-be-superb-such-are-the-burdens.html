<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f321c95e970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Vlcsnap-avatar00115" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f321c95e970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f321c95e970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Vlcsnap-avatar00115" /></a></p>
<p>The camera moves toward Peter&#39;s head and then inside it.&#0160; The viewer is looking at Peter looking at Peggy in the first <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48047" target="_self">medium close up</a> in the scene.&#0160; (There is a slight unreality to this point of view shot: it zooms in on the pair in a way only cameras can.&#0160; The zooming seems to act as a cinematic proxy for attention or concentration.)&#0160; Slattery made sure the nearly invisible wall separating them remained visible, which creates a tension between the intimacy of the close up and the reality of the glass walls separating them.&#0160; That he chooses a more intimate when these two are in different rooms is, for obvious reasons, significant.&#0160; She sees him peering at her and, by its positioning, the camera acknowledges the bond that will remain despite the increasing distance between them: the baby they had together.&#0160; Just to hammer the point home, Slattery slips into Peggy&#39;s head:</p>

<p>Absolutely.  I think the fact that we have an actor--Slattery plays Roger Sterling on the show--directing leads to a little overcompensation.  That said, the scene following the wipe, which I&#39;ll finish working up today, migraine willing, is much more subtle.  But yes, there&#39;s one too many reverse shots before the wipe.  Were it up to me, I would&#39;ve lingered on their faces a few beats more each instead of reversing ... but when we&#39;re discussing shot selection at this level of detail, we know we&#39;re talking about quality, so all&#39;s good. </p></span>

<p>What? If the point of the scene were the division symbolized by the closed office door then yes, the camerawork would be didactic, the scene schematic. But the (lemme coin some word business here) <em>didachtimaticism</em> is only the setup for the scene&#39;s main point. Those two worlds need one another (as the pretentious filmmaker couldn&#39;t accept but Peggy knows); there is no actual personal/business line (as Pete and his father-in-law got to reexperience in the apartment); the richest life these people can have is always gonna be ambiguous, in-progress, unsatisfied/unsatisfying...and built on mutual acknowledgement and acceptance (as Peggy&#39;s complex, beautifully-acted reaction to Pete&#39;s news reveals). Pete and Peggy have a genuine connection that none of this career/hangout stuff can actually sever, and as they both become actual grownups, they&#39;re finding grownup ways to relate to one another.</p>

<p>They smile at one another through the glass, for god&#39;s sake. It&#39;s not just the plot-device baby bonding them, it&#39;s that they&#39;re <em>growing up together</em>, and incidentally, they&#39;re living (complexly) with the fact that the baby will <em>grow up without them</em>.</p>

<p>The scene doesn&#39;t make a structural or political point, it makes an emotional one. Absolutely beautiful.</p></span>

Peggy and Pete live in the <em>same</em> world, just like everybody else. This is the show&#39;s version of the puerile <em>Lost</em> finale - each character is afforded chances to experience, to be conscious of, the collapse of the illusion of different worlds. (Interesting counterpoint to the markedly more schematic <em>Sopranos</em> in that regard...)</p></span>

Here goes: Nolte is complaining about Steven Zeitchik’s article in the L.A. Times, in which he writes: But the Stallone picture—with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (”We will kill this American disease,” as the TV spot enticed us)—planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. According to Nolte, this amounts to Zeitchik “toxifying ‘The Expendables’ by ridiculing its simple worldview,” but Nolte fails to explain why a film should be praised for the simplicity of its worldview. The most he can muster is that “the nihilism found in the moral equivalency preached by the likes of George Clooney and Paul Haggis is [not] complicated,” which amounts to “if they can do it, we can do it.” The problem with that logic should be obvious: it’s not a defense of simplistic worldviews, it’s the claim that if I set your house on fire, you would be right to retaliate by doing the same to mine. That both positions may be weak is evidently a point beyond his ability to comprehend. Nolte then provides another non-answer, claiming that a simple straight-forward story that’s actually about something is much more difficult to successfully craft than a confusing and muddled story that’s believes in absolutely nothing. Paint-by-numbers might not be Rembrandt but it takes more skill than throwing monkey shit at a canvas. Note that he again argues that The Expendables is “about” something without ever defining what that thing is. This is the obverse of Groucho Marx’s “Whatever It Is, I’m Against It” argument, in that whatever The Expendables is about, Nolte’s in favor of it, whatever it might be. But whatever it is, it’s morally unambiguous, which means the following claim of Zeitchik is utter bunk: [u]ntil this weekend, old-school action movies—defined, for argument’s sake, as films with a slew of explosions, a shortage of moral ambiguity and a triumph of physical effects over digital ones—had seen better days. Nolte responds: [T]his is what happens when you’re in possession of a laughably biased theory in search of proof—especially when the surprise successes of “300″ and “Taken,” not to mention “Salt,” the first “Transformers,” and “Gran Torino”—make a total fool of that moral ambiguity theory. Admittedly, Nolte is an expert in all things tendentious, so he should know it when he sees it. But a brief comparison of the material between both parties’ em-dashes demonstrates who’s arguing honestly and who isn’t. Zeitchik defines “old-school action movies … as films with a slew of explosions, a shortage of moral ambiguity and a triumph of physical effects over digital ones.” Nolte responds by listing four films, but only one of them, Taken, fits Zeitchik’s definition. 300 was filmed entirely in front of a green screen; Gran Torino contains no “explosions,” much less “a slew of” them; and unless he knows something I don’t, the Transformers in Transformers...</span></a></div>

Books should be rereadable, but Fantagraphics' editions of Jason's work explode upon reading. If you pick one up after having read it, the binding will release the pages from their commitment to the book and allow them to form a new one with a pile on the floor. Scattered thus, they make for a far less compelling narrative ... but they are much easier to scan. Might this analog bug be a digital feature? (Most likely not.) UPDATE: Talk about service. There's a reason I love this press.</span></a></div>
