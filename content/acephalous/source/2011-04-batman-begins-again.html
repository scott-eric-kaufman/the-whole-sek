Heath Ledger notwithstanding, I think it's fairly obvious that Batman Begins is the better of recent reboots. Nolan structures the first film not around an admittedly ingeniuous performance, but around a modified classical dynamic, by which I mean, he abides by his Aristotle. It opens with the most incentive of incentive moments—a boy watching his parents murdered before his eyes—then proceeds to a classic peripeteia*—that moment of reversal when the boy who witnessed his parents' murder decides to forsake revenge and fight all crime instead the responsible criminals. It need not bear mentioning, I don't think, that the deus ex machina, which Aristotle would otherwise despise, in this case fits within &quot;the unity of action,&quot; because it has &quot;an air of design&quot; that's well-nigh indisputable. The real crux is the film's anagnorisis—or &quot;revelation&quot; in the I-murdered-my-father-made-kids-with-my-mother-sense—which occurs at a time Aristotle would've approved of, but not in the way he'd prefer. You'll remember that, early in Batman Begins, the recently returned Bruce Wayne takes his horny butler's advice and invites some models to go swimming in a restaurant with him: Nolan's use of a medium-long shot there is deceptive, as these aren't really women so much as beards: I'm not saying they're all legs and hair, the cropped medium shot notwithstanding—but for the purpose of the plot, Nolan certain reduces them to as much.

The point is that these women are props, mere things Alfred suggests Bruce Wayne should acquire should he not want to be discovered as the Batman.

The camera centers on him and her dark hair turns into an inhuman column: In this shot-reverse-shot sequence, he's clearly the focus. Granted, he may be out of focus on the reverse shots, but he's still recognizably him, whereas when the camera flips, she becomes another dark image plastered on a theater wall. The irony of this portrayal is significant, though, as she's about to utter the most important words in the film: &quot;It's not who you are underneath,&quot; she tells him, &quot;but what you do, that defines you.&quot; Note that from the beginning of this exchange to the utterance of this line, Nolan's moved from a medium, to a medium close-up, to a..." />

			<p>(<em>I never thought I&#39;d dip back into <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/batman-begins-works-because-christopher-nolan-decided-to-spend-the-first-hour-and-twenty-minutes-denying-the-audience-what-it.html" target="_self">this well</a>, but then life happens and there you go.</em>)</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/dark-knight-scene-analysis.html" target="_self">Heath Ledger</a> <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/little-bit-more-on-teaching-the-dark-knight.html" target="_self">notwithstanding</a>, I think it&#39;s fairly obvious that <em>Batman Begins </em>is the better of recent reboots.&#0160; Nolan structures the first film not around an admittedly ingeniuous performance, but around a modified classical dynamic, by which I mean, he abides by his Aristotle.&#0160; It opens with the most incentive of incentive moments—a boy watching his parents murdered before his eyes—then proceeds to a classic <em>peripeteia</em><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2011/04/batman-is-always-beginning-again/comment-page-1#comment-108021" target="_self"><em>*</em></a>—that moment of reversal when the boy who witnessed his parents&#39; murder decides to forsake revenge and fight all crime instead the responsible criminals.&#0160; It need not bear mentioning, I don&#39;t think, that the  <em><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/files/batman-begins.jpg"><span class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e8735f9f8970d">deus ex machina</span></a></em>, which Aristotle would otherwise despise, in this case fits within &quot;the unity of action,&quot; because it has &quot;an air of design&quot; that&#39;s well-nigh indisputable.&#0160;</p>
<p>The real crux is the film&#39;s<em> anagnorisis</em>—or &quot;revelation&quot; in the I-murdered-my-father-made-kids-with-my-mother-sense—which occurs at a time Aristotle would&#39;ve approved of, but not in the way he&#39;d prefer.&#0160; You&#39;ll remember that, early in <em>Batman Begins</em>, the recently returned Bruce Wayne takes his horny butler&#39;s advice and invites some models to go swimming in a restaurant with him:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605afa6f970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Batman begins00014" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605afa6f970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605afa6f970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Batman begins00014" /></a></p>
<p>Nolan&#39;s use of a medium-long shot there is deceptive, as these aren&#39;t really women so much as beards:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605afc81970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Batman begins00018" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605afc81970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605afc81970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Batman begins00018" /></a></p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re all legs and hair, the cropped medium shot notwithstanding—but for the purpose of the plot, Nolan certain reduces them to as much.&#0160; (We&#39;re just going to skip over the scene of them skinny dipping, you know, for the kids.)&#0160; The point is that these women are props, mere things Alfred suggests Bruce Wayne should acquire should he not want to be discovered as the Batman.&#0160; So, then, <em>anagnorisis </em>avoided ... except:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3b62a93970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Batman begins00070" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3b62a93970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3b62a93970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Batman begins00070" /></a></p>
<p>The love of Wayne&#39;s life can&#39;t even look at him—and not just because I caught&#0160; bad capture.&#0160; She&#39;s just watched him escort two soaking models from a hotel she&#39;s about to learn he bought, so she shouldn&#39;t want to look at him.&#0160; But when she does, he makes a plea:</p>

<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605b04cf970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Batman begins00092" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605b04cf970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605b04cf970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Batman begins00092" /></a></p>
<p>Which you can tell, because he&#39;s wearing his best &quot;plea&quot; face, insisting that he &quot;is more,&quot; whatever that means (&quot;I&#39;m the Batman&quot;) but also because previously Nolan kept him, however blurrily, in frame with Rachel Dawes when she spoke:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e87365044970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Batman begins00095" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e87365044970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e87365044970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Batman begins00095" /></a></p>
<p>But when he needs to say something?&#0160; The camera centers on him and her dark hair turns into an inhuman column:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3b63063970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Batman begins00099" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3b63063970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3b63063970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Batman begins00099" /></a></p>
<p>In this shot-reverse-shot sequence, he&#39;s clearly the focus.&#0160; Granted, he may be out of focus on the reverse shots, but he&#39;s still recognizably him, whereas when the camera flips, she becomes another dark image plastered on a theater wall.&#0160; The irony of this portrayal is significant, though, as she&#39;s about to utter the most important words in the film:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605b0b5e970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Batman begins00147" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605b0b5e970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605b0b5e970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Batman begins00147" /></a></p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not who you are underneath,&quot; she tells him, &quot;but what you do, that defines you.&quot;&#0160; Note that from the beginning of this exchange to the utterance of this line, Nolan&#39;s moved from a medium, to a medium close-up, to a close-up on Rachel Dawes.&#0160; He&#39;s not letting the words carry the weight here alone: his camera&#39;s actively abetting in the creation of their significance.&#0160; Just in case you didn&#39;t catch how her words diminished him, Nolan lets his camera hammer it home:</p>

<p>He reverses the cut-pan into Rachel&#39;s face with a slow-cut-pan away from Wayne&#39;s.&#0160; The audience has been convinced of her importance by the camera&#39;s movement towards her.&#0160; It&#39;s been convinced of his insignificance by it&#39;s movement away.&#0160; But!</p>

<p>Followed by a long shot of a &quot;car&quot; being driven with anger!&#0160; THIS MAN WILL NOT BE DIMINISHED!&#0160; Nolan knocked Wayne down above, but as the film proclaims, repeatedly, people only fall to get back up.&#0160; But &quot;getting back up&quot; isn&#39;t enough for this genre.&#0160; Wayne must GET BACK UP, which entails all the criminals being set free, a poisonous gas clogging the air, and every cop in Gotham already having been deployed and incapacitated.&#0160; Because this is what it takes for the Batman to GET BACK UP:</p>

<p>At which point, Aristotle&#39;s very happy about the way the plot&#39;s coming together, but we&#39;ve not yet had a moment of sublime <em>anagnorisis.&#0160; </em>It&#39;s all well-and-good that the Wayne-Gordon-Batman relation is being sewn up, but that&#39;s neither who you are underneath nor what you do that defines you.&#0160; If only Rachel Dawes was stuck on that island—</p>

<p>Excellent!&#0160; Maybe with that kid from earlier in the film, too, to wrap it all—</p>

<p>Even better!&#0160; Good thing we cut from that medium shot on her to that close-up on him, otherwise we wouldn&#39;t be able to see the pain in his face when he says &quot;Batman will save us.&quot;&#0160; Because he won&#39;t.&#0160; It makes narrative sense, but Aristotle would roll if Batman literally dropped from the sky <em>deus ex machina</em>-style and saved these two from the island of unlocked prisoners—</p>

<p>Those were Bat-thighs, descending from above, like a Greek god, to save this child and the love of Bruce Wayne&#39;s life.&#0160; Total coincidence.&#0160; It&#39;s not like he&#39;s about to—</p>

<p>Someone has <em>anagnorisis </em>face, and rightly so, because it&#39;s been a long time coming.&#0160; All the close-ups on the faces should&#39;ve alerted the audience to the fact that a revelation was on its way, as there&#39;s no reason to resort to so many in a row if the audience isn&#39;t supposed to key in on faces.&#0160; Plus, all those humanizing close-ups make the following sequence all the more moving.&#0160; First, a very brief long shot, which breaks the rhythm of the close-ups:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e3b66dc1970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"> </a><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605b44f7970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Batman begins00827" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605b44f7970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605b44f7970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Batman begins00827" /></a></p>
<p>It also interrupts the conversational rhythm with the abruptness of his flight, emphasizing, yet again, that <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/little-bit-more-on-teaching-the-dark-knight.html" target="_self">the Batman is very fast</a>.&#0160; But it also adds to the melancholy characterizing the following long shot:</p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605b47aa970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Batman begins00834" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605b47aa970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef014e605b47aa970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Batman begins00834" /></a></p>
<p>The little boy he&#39;s just revealed himself to be is alone in the sky, delving into certain pain and possible death, for reasons which the audience knows as well as Dawes.&#0160; And he&#39;s doing so <em>alone</em>.&#0160; I know <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/09/baseball.html" target="_self">italicized-worthy-alone</a> <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/10/nonono.html" target="_self">from different circumstances</a>, but in some respect, so do we all.&#0160; Even if we don&#39;t, though, Nolan frames this final image in a way that makes any and all final leaps sink into our chest irrespective of whether we&#39;ve ever been unfortunate enough to have to make them.</p>
<p>When I say film&#39;s the most manipulative meduim out there, folks, I&#39;m very rarely kidding.</p>

When I first saw it, the editing really weirded me out, because it seemed like the tone of a lot of the scenes and individual shots would have fit better with something that was a little... slower?  Almost like Nolan had made a slow, careful look at batman but when it was edited, someone with a shorter attention span just went and trimmed a few seconds off of almost all the shots with people&#39;s faces in them.<br />
I remember being like &quot;I&#39;m intrigued, I wonder what he&#39;ll do with the next one.&quot;</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef014e8736e132970d-content"><p>Put differently: Wayne&#39;s scared shitless when he jumps off that roof.  He only revealed his identity because he thought he was, in fact, going to be killed.  He didn&#39;t know that the folks he&#39;d be attacking would view him as some sort of video-game-sky-demon -- he thought he&#39;d had to fight his way to Ra&#39;s al Ghul&#39;s henchmen, then throw down with the man himself, and he wasn&#39;t certain he could do so after having been trapped beneath a burning log, etc.  It&#39;s a scene that&#39;s stunningly set up, and I think the lurching pacing at that point is actually poignant.  We don&#39;t want to think about the futures we might lose before jumping into the activities that&#39;ll cost us them.</p></span>

<p>Not in the least, anymore.  I&#39;ve basically proven that I&#39;m worthy of having a free hand, and that I&#39;m not teaching &quot;down&quot; to students&#39; low capabilities, but using so-called &quot;low&quot; culture to teach them how <em>all</em> culture works.  I&#39;m a bit blessed, in this regard.  </p></span>

I'm thinking, as per the tentative title of this post, of delving into meta-fictional accounts of the origin of comic &quot;heroism&quot; this quarter, and have come up with the following (largely other-side-of-the-pond) syllabus: &quot;The Origin of Batman&quot; (excerpt from Batman 47) - Bob Kane You begin with the almost-begin: this is the first time Joe Chill's mentioned, by which I mean implicated, in the death of Wayne's parents. There's an earlier reference to their murder in Detective Comics 39 (November 1939), but it's abridged in a way that makes the story itself unrecognizable. (Which is, yes, the very opposite of the point I make below about Morrison's All-Star Superman, but that's because you can't already assume an audience is familiar with a story before it's ever been told.) Batman: Year One (comic) - Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli See what I did there? In terms of comparative styles, now I can introduce Asterios Polyp. To wit, Mazzucchelli in Year One: Compared to Mazzucchelli in Asterios Polyp: Those aren't as different as I thought they'd be. (&quot;I have a hole in my cape,&quot; you can almost imagine Mazzucchelli's distraught Wayne saying.) But outside the cleanliness of the lines, there's little to make you believe that the person responsible for the first image would later be responsible for the second ... and that's a belief I'm going to try to disabuse my students of. Batman Begins (film) - Christopher Nolan Because you think I'm capable of teaching this course without bringing up Nolan's film? I didn't think so. Planetary/Batman (comic) - Warren Ellis This'll be the fourth re-telling of the Batman origin myth, only this time endlessly looped. The point, rhetorically speaking, in having them encounter four versions of the same story is 1) to emphasize that there's some inherent appeal there, but 2) to demonstrate that even if a story has inherent appeal, the manner in which a given rhetor presents it actually matters. The raw stuff is all well and good, but the power's in the telling. Planetary #1 -10 (comic) - Warren Ellis They're billed as &quot;the archeologists of the impossible,&quot; after all, and Ellis's engagement with both the history of the genre and its conventions could hardly find a more suitable course to be taught in. All-Star Superman (comic) - Grant Morrison I'm thinking of teaching only the first page of the first issue, as it's the most brilliantly compact origin story ever, and after that Morrison's metafictional games might be a bit too much for students to handle. There's a genius to its concision, i.e. the manner in which it boils down a story everyone already knows to its barest bones, and then presents them to a knowing audience in a way that is, quite frankly, moving. (Sorry, sorry, I couldn't help myself.) The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume...</span></a></div>

SEK doesn't know that yet. It is imperative for the reader to read said student's voice like this: SEK walks to the Smart Podium and begins to open the images and videos he will be projecting on the wall during class. MR. HELLO! approaches him. MR. HELLO! HELLOOOO! Will YOOOOU be doing the teaching of THIS writing class today? SEK: I'm the sub. I was told you were expecting me. OTHER STUDENTS: We are. MR. HELLO! I am not INNNN this writing class, I am considering adding a writing class to my portfolio this quarter. May I add THIS writing class? SEK: I'm just the sub. You'd need to ask the teacher. SEK explains course policy about adding this deep into the quarter. MR. HELLO! But I am thinking of adding THIS writing course THIS quarter. SEK: Even if I wanted to, I couldn't add you to this class this quarter, because I'm not the teacher. I'm just the sub. MR. HELLO! But what I DOOOO want to know is, what will I DOOOO in this writing class? SEK politely informs MR. HELLO! of what generally goes on in the composition department. The other students—the ones actually enrolled in the class—begin to fidget. MR HELLO! So what YOOOOU are telling me is that when I add THIS writing class, I will be DOOOOING writing. How much writing will I be DOOOOING in THIS writing class, counting by WORDS. OTHER STUDENTS: At least two thousands words a week. MR HELLO! So what YOOOOU are telling me is that when I add THIS writing class, I will be DOOOOING more writing than it is normal to DOOOO. SEK: I can't add you to this writing class, because I'm just the sub, and it's already a little too late in the quarter to add. MR HELLO! So what YOOOOU are telling is that when I add THIS writing class, I will be— SEK: I can't add you to this class— MR HELLO! But when you DOOOO— SEK checks the clock and sees that it's about a minute after class should've started. SEK: I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you leave. MR HELLO! So what YOOOOU are telling is me is that when I DOOOO return on Monday to add this class, YOOOOU will be adding me to it. SEK: I'm just the sub, and I'm subbing for the course director, but I can assure you, she's not going to let you add this late in the quarter. MR HELLO! But when I DOOOO see you on Monday, YOOOOU will— OTHER STUDENTS: Enough already! Just leave! MR HELLO! (addressing SEK) I will be seeing YOOOOU on Monday. SEK: Alright then, you do that.
