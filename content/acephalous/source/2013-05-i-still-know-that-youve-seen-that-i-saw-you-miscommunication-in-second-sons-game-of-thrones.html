        <meta name="description" content="To recap: this is a complement to the most recent podcast Steven Attewell and I produced, on “Second Sons,” in which we discussed, among many things, miscommunication at the wedding of Sansa Stark and Tyrion Lannister. I found my contribution to that part of the discussion lacking, so I decided to demonstrate what I meant about Tyrion coming to dominate a scene that possesses real potential for chaos. The first part can be found here and really needs to be read for the following to make sense. When we left off, what had been a hostile but orderly wedding banquet teetered on the edge of something. Relations had been frosty but fine until Loras Tyrell reminded people how legs work and walked away from the table, which inspired Tyrion to do something with alcohol. His father, Tywin, noticed his clever son noticing Loras and, aware that Tyrion can become a giant fucking lion when the mood strikes, strode across the hall to talk to him. However, his grandson (twice-over) had a terrible idea: Joffrey “Baratheon” decided to humiliate his former bride-to-be, Sansa, but caught Margaery Tyrell noticing his planning-face and decided she should be part of it too. All of this happened via glances passing between parties. We resume mere seconds after the last post ended, with Tyrion staring at Sansa’s ass: This is only unusual not only because, in recent episodes, Tyrion’s been shot in a manner that makes his head appear level to those of the people he’s speaking to. From the camera’s perspective, when he spoke to his father, sister or nephew, he’d ceased being a little person. But earlier in this episode, his height — and its relation to his sexual abilities — had been made an issue when he met with Sansa: Such is what’s required of him not to stare at her ass. The contrast between this shot before the wedding and the one of his father — that’s Twyin behind him in the first image — is part of both Michelle MacClaren, the director, and Tyrion’s respective plans. In order to make himself appear drunker than he actually is, Tyrion abandons the pretense of being the willful supplicant and lets his eyes rest at their natural level. That it happens to coincide with Sansa’s ass is a happy and convenient coincidence that fails to impress his father: Note that since she’s merely moving the camera up and to the let about a foot, MacClaren could’ve used a conventional two-shot; but because conventional two-shots create the impression of a bond between characters, she shot them individually.

 on “Second Sons,” in which we discussed, among many things, 
miscommunication at the wedding of Sansa Stark and Tyrion Lannister. I 
found <a href="http://youtu.be/5KQ8ti9CHRU#t=42m48s">my contribution to that part of the discussion</a>

to dominate a scene that possesses real potential for chaos. The first

<p>When we left off, what had been a hostile but orderly wedding banquet
 teetered on the edge of something. Relations had been frosty but fine 
until Loras Tyrell reminded people how legs work and walked away from 
the table, which <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00223a.png">inspired Tyrion</a> to do something with alcohol. His father, Tywin, noticed his clever son noticing Loras and, aware that Tyrion can become <em>a giant fucking lion</em>
 when the mood strikes, strode across the hall to talk to him. However, 
his grandson&#0160; (twice-over) had a terrible idea: Joffrey “Baratheon” 
decided to humiliate his former bride-to-be, Sansa, but <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00249.png">caught Margaery Tyrell noticing his planning-face</a>
 and decided she should be part of it too. All of this happened via 
glances passing between parties. We resume mere seconds after the last 
post ended, with Tyrion staring at Sansa’s ass:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00341.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00341.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00341" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This is only unusual not only because, in recent episodes, Tyrion’s 
been shot in a manner that makes his head appear level to those of the 
people he’s speaking to. From the camera’s perspective, when he spoke 
to his father, sister or nephew, he’d ceased being a little person. But 
earlier in this episode, his height — and its relation to his sexual 
abilities — had been made an issue when he met with Sansa:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons003281.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons003281.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00328" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Such is what’s required of him <em>not </em>to stare at her ass. The 
contrast between this shot before the wedding and the one of his father —
 that’s Twyin behind him in the first image — is part of both Michelle 
MacClaren, the director, and Tyrion’s respective plans. In order to make
 himself appear drunker than he actually is, Tyrion abandons the 
pretense of being the willful supplicant and lets his eyes rest at their
 natural level. That it happens to coincide with Sansa’s ass is a happy 
and convenient coincidence that fails to impress his father:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00342.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00342.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00342" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Note that since she’s merely moving the camera up and to the let 
about a foot, MacClaren could’ve used a conventional two-shot; but 
because conventional two-shots create the impression of a bond between 
characters, she shot them individually. This has two effects: it 
reinforces the notion that these two are only strategically “intimate,” 
and it allows Tyrion to dominate the screen when he’s on it. That may 
not seem significant, but it’s important that the audience, at this 
moment, see Tyrion as someone capable of dominating the screen:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00344.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00344.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00344" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Is his father behind him? Yes, in the literal sense; but only maybe 
in the colloquial, because Tywin doesn’t know what Tyrion’s planning. 
But in a scene in which eyelines and eyeline matches are so important, 
it’s not a coincidence that while Tywin’s staring directly at his son, 
Tyrion’s refusing to establish eye contact at all. It was his eyes, 
after all, that gave away the fact that he was planning something 
earlier, so no matter how very intently his father stares at him:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00346.png"><img alt="" height="282" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00346.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00346" width="503" /></a></p>
<p>Tyrion’s going to refuse to meet that stare, which would allow his 
father further entry into whatever it is he’s planning. It’s significant
 that the dialogue at this moment is mostly Tywin talking about the 
importance of <em>his </em>plans for Tyrion and Sansa coming to fruition. It’s as if he’s trying to stare Tyrion into submission, but it’s not working:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00351.png"><img alt="" height="279" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00351.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00351" width="499" /></a></p>
<p>Tyrion won’t return his father’s gaze — because in addition to giving
 away his own plan, it would suggest consenting with his father’s. So he
 continues to make contact with everything except his father’s eyes. 
This is where the situation stands when MacClaren pulls the camera back 
into the only kind of two-shot that doesn’t suggest a bond between 
characters, <em>i.e. </em>one in which the characters are looking past each other <em>in different directions</em>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00359.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00359.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00359" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This is a singular variation of the two one-shots of <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00077.png">Tyrion</a> and <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00078.png">Sansa</a>
 earlier in the scene. So intent is Tyrion on not making eye contact 
with his father that he’s failed to notice that Joffrey’s returned. 
Tywin recognizes the gravity of the situation: Joffrey’s decided that 
Tyrion and Sansa should be “gently” escorted to their wedding chambers 
and stripped for all to see, and Tywin isn’t entirely sure how to tell 
his grandson that this is a foul idea. So he leaves:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00360.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00360.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00360" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Note that as Joffrey enters and calls for Sansa’s public humiliation, he’s looking <em>right at Margaery</em>.
 The threat isn’t even implicit: he caught her staring at his 
planning-face and wants her to know exactly how their upcoming nuptials 
will end. Tyrion isn’t sure what to do. Whatever his plan had been, 
Joffrey’s has interrupted it, so Tyrion takes a moment to stare at his 
wine glass again. He may not be sure what to do next, but he’s certain 
it’ll involve alcohol. Joffrey then seeks approval from his mother:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00363.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00363.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00363" width="499" /></a></p>
<p>Or, more accurately, from the chair she recently vacated. Despite the
 audience’s initial confusion as to where the characters were in space 
and in relation to each other, at this point it’s clear that Joffrey’s 
staring at his mother’s empty chair. Sansa, meanwhile, can no more make 
eye contact with the boy-king <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00218.png">than his mother could</a>.
 She knows the depravities of which he’s capable. The audience, at this 
moment, is reminded of what happened when Margaery stared directly at 
him. One does not make eye contact with the boy king. Tyrion agrees:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00368.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00368.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00368" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>He continues to stare at the table evaluating his options. He ignores
 both Joffrey’s taunt and Sansa’s plea. The situation is so unbearable 
that the audience is happy to follow everyone’s eyelines to the Tyrion, 
then to the happy couple’s table: better to be staring at the table 
cloth than dealing with what’s about to happen. And it <em>is </em>about to happen:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00371.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00371.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00371" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Joffrey turns back to the audience generally, and in the direction of
 the Tyrell table particularly, and reiterates his terrible idea: Sansa 
shall be carried to her wedding bed and stripped. Publicly. That she’s 
not included in this shot indicates that this isn’t really about her. 
Obviously, Joffrey enjoys humiliating her — but his design here is 
grander and aimed, along with his eyes, on his future in-laws. Tyrion 
bides time.</p>
<p>Then he doesn’t:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00372.png"><img alt="" height="281" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00372.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00372" width="501" /></a></p>
<p>Now <em>this</em> is a lovely little shot. Tyrion’s pretending to be 
far more intoxicated than he actually is, so initially the fact that 
this seems to be a shallow focus shot <em>of nothing</em> could be his 
drunken perspective. It isn’t. Tyrion’s decided to act, and though it’s 
difficult to see, there’s the thin edge of a blade in front of Sansa’s 
down-turned face. MacClaren racks the focus to capture Joffrey’s 
expression:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00383.png"><img alt="" height="281" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00383.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00383" width="501" /></a></p>
<p>Tyrion’s just <em>pulled a knife on the king</em>. Joffrey’s face says it all: “You don’t pull a knife on the king! <em>You don’t pull a knife on the king</em>!” Unless you do:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00376.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00376.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00376" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>And here’s the close-up the entire scene’s been setting up: Tyrion 
staring down Joffrey at eye level. He’s no longer Sansa’s willful 
supplicant: he’s dominating this close-up and he’s <em>a giant fucking lion </em>and no one has any idea what to do or where to look:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00380.png"><img alt="" height="282" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00380.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00380" width="503" /></a></p>
<p>Because he’s Joffrey, Joffrey looks to his mother’s empty chair. 
Tywin seems to be looking there too, a plaintive glance that somehow 
communicates his disdain for how Cersei’s raised the boy-king. Margeary 
seems to be the only one who can look at Tyrion — Olenna stares at her 
staring at him while Sansa studies the floor <em>and silly me I almost forgot </em>Tyrion continues giving Joffrey the eye-fuck of the century:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00384.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00384.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00384" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Who owns this room? <em>Tyrion owns this room</em>. His father’s impressed:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons003792.png"><img alt="" height="281" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons003792.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00379" width="501" /></a></p>
<p>Note that he’s not making direct eye contact with Tyrion though. He’s
 looking in the right direction, but not high enough to be looking at 
Tyrion. The perspective’s a little off here because he’s looking at the 
camera, so I had to approximate his eyeline. There’s other evidence that
 he’s not looking precisely at Tyrion though:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00387.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00387.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00387" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Joffrey isn’t looking directly at him either. Note that Sansa and 
Margaery are looking to Tywin for their cues, because everyone seems to 
realize what happens when the boy-king’s brought to anger. And he’s 
certainly angry: he’s been forced to lower his eyes to his uncle because
 he’s suffering what Elizabeth Loftus calls “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_focus">weapon focus</a>“:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00390.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00390.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00390" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Except it’s not fear that’s blinding him so much as outrage. <em>You do not pull a knife on the king</em>!
 But he’s not only offended: he’s profoundly disappointed that what 
should have been Sansa’s humiliating moment has become his. Tyrion’s 
ruined the evening’s “entertainment.” He’s upset the king. That Joffrey 
can’t steal his eyes away from the knife is a telling detail: it’s part 
and parcel of <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/11/game-of-thrones-table-setting-and-brain-burning-in-you-win-or-you-die">his reluctance to do anything for himself</a>.
 He’s as much of a Lannister as a person can possibly be, but he lacks 
the  conviction for self-reliance Tywin tried to teach Jaime in that 
scene. Unlike Ned Stark, <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/09/game-of-thrones-winter-is-coming-for-will-and-bran.html">who in the first episode of the series beheaded poor Will in a manner befitting a lord</a>,
 Joffrey orders knights to kill people and executioners to put them 
down. Sansa, meanwhile, seems to recognize how precarious her situation 
is and studies the floor so as not to draw Joffrey’s ire further, and 
that’s when Tywin calls a stop to it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00388.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00388.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00388" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>He shifts his eyes — but not his body — from the Tyrion’s blade to 
the enraged boy-king. Significantly, it’s while he’s looking at Joffrey 
that Tyrion finally relents:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00395.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00395.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00395" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>He still dominates the screen — and the room for that matter — but he
 breaks into an ostensibly drunken laugh and eases the tension among the
 gathered. That he relents doesn’t change the fact that he’s just put 
the boy-king in his place, publicly, in a moment of enforced humiliation
 that Joffrey thought would be his. Little as the victory may matter in 
the long run, on this day Tyrion’s succeeded where Joffrey failed. He’s 
taken ownership of his own wedding banquet away from the boy-king who 
thinks the world belongs to him — who thinks he’s the culmination of his
 grandfather’s lifetime of scheming. And it’s in this moment that Tywin,
 for once, seems to agree:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00402.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/second-sons00402.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="second sons00402" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Or sees something on the ceiling and decides to look at it. This is 
the one eyeline that baffled me. Is he looking at Cersei descending from the balcony maybe? Is this 
an exaggerated glance at Tyrion for the purpose of making him seem 
“taller” in the eyes of the assembled? I don’t know. But I do know that 
his estimation of what Tyrion’s accomplished isn’t out of line with 
mine. It’s just he doesn’t see the point in needlessly annoying the 
boy-king. Fortunately for the audience, MacClaren’s been watching the 
show and understands the joy that comes with watching Joffrey impotently
 roar. <em>&#0160;</em></p>
<p><em>Especially</em> when it’s at his “little uncle” and <em>especially </em>when it’s because he’s interrupted the boy-king’s reindeer games.</p>

I found my contribution to that part of the discussion lacking, so I decided to demonstrate what I meant about Tyrion coming to dominate a scene that possesses real potential for chaos. But first let me make two noncontroversial statements: Prior to acquiring language, mammals developed the ability to use their eyeballs to control others’ eyeballs simply by looking around an environment. Filmmakers have long taken advantage of our inability not to follow the eyeballs of characters as they glance around the screen. So if you walk into a crowd and everyone’s looking up: I don’t care who you are or where you’re from, you’re going to follow their eyes and look up too: It’s just natural—even if you’re really not from around here. The same logic applies when you’re watching a film. If all the characters look at something, your eyes will follow theirs. It’s the quietest means a director has to move your eyeballs where he or she wants them. Noisier varieties include dramatic movement, the sudden appearance of a new object or character, a loud unexpected sound, etc. Clearly these attentive systems evolved hand-in-hand: the first person who notices the sudden appearance of a new object may make a dramatic movement, which catches the attention of everyone else and compels them to follow that first person’s glance. For example, if four people are in dining room and one of them notices a giant fucking lion in the kitchen, that person’s likely to make a dramatic movement accompanied by a loud unexpected sound; everyone else will turn to that person and then follow their glance into the kitchen, at which point they’ll also notice a giant fucking lion and panic will happen. At this point in our social evolution, however, we don’t need dramatic movements and loud unexpected sounds to compel our eyes to follow others’ glances—we just do it. When coupled with all the social strictures that regulate who can look at whom and in what way and when, the potential for a director to make an audience very uncomfortable should be obvious. They can make us look at things we shouldn’t be looking at, or at things we can be looking at but are doing so wrongly, or most powerfully, they can use the sympathy or enmity they’ve already established for particular characters to make us pity or praise them for the direction of their glances. The wedding of Sansa and Tyrion is a perfect example of exactly how this is done by someone quite talented at doing it, Michelle MacClaren, whose episode of Breaking Bad, “Gliding Over All,” was all about staring and following stares. (In fact that second link contains images strongly resembling those about to follow, except this time, for ease of reference I’ll keep everyone’s eyelines...</span></a></div>
