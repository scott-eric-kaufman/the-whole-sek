<p><em>Wait wait wait</em>—I thought conservatives were upset because

<p>All the outrage centers around a conference call designed, in the
words soon-to-be-becked* Yosi Sergant, “to raise the visibility” for a
program <a href="http://www.911dayofservice.org/Mission/">whose purpose</a>
is to encourage “all Americans and others throughout the world to
voluntarily perform at least one good deed or another service activity
on the anniversary of 9/11 each year, and on other days marked by
terrorist events.” The problem, it seems, is that the NEA is supposed
to be above partisanship, and supporting the President’s United We
Serve initiative is seen by conservatives to be a partisan issue. Here
are some of its highly partisan goals:</p>
<blockquote><p>We want to make Americans’ lives better by asking
everybody to participate in shaping the life of their community and
make the quality of life better.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, “making Americans’ lives better” is a partisan issue. Which
would be acceptable, were the administration not being so heavy-handed:</p>
<blockquote><p>[H]ow do we move the people who look to each of you for
guidance to get involved? We have to leave that to you because nobody
else knows how to do it better than you do[.]</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, dictating that individual organizations ought to do what
they think is appropriate in a manner of their own choosing is but one
step from installing Obama as Dictator for Life. Which is what they
will do, because these are doggedly partisan projects:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hearken back to an example that happened right before
election day during the campaign when a bunch of DJs got together and
put on a conference call for all the top radio and club DJs around the
country who got onto a telephone call and encouraged everyone to make
DJ mixes using songs that would encourage people to get out and vote.</p></blockquote>
<p>And when these hip-hop-listening kids went out and voted for whomever they so desired, who did they vote for? <em>The</em> <em>Dictator for Life</em>, who now wants them to</p>
<blockquote><p>to go out and donate blood or adopt an alley way or
identify some walls in [their] neighborhood that have been stricken
with graffiti that need a mural.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to conservatives, encouraging artists to encourage kids to
donate blood is now a partisan activity because it falls under the
heading of “service,” and “service” is communism; “service” is
socialism; “service” is Marxism; “service” is fascism.</p>
<p>So now, for conservatives, “service” is partisan.</p>
<p>That’s the root of all this outrage—that the NEA would listen in on
a conference call designed to spread the word about the National Day of
Service.&#0160; For more on this and other trivial items that are suddenly

<blockquote>In Kirk Cameron’s new movie, “Fireproof,” he has to kiss the actress playing his wife. That was a problem.

<p>Cameron will not kiss any woman who is not his wife.</p>

<p>“I have a commitment not to kiss any other woman,” the former child star of “Growing Pains” told Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford Monday on TODAY in New York.<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26851749/" rel="nofollow">*</a></blockquote></p>

<p>Good on you, Kirk!</p>

<p>I think though that our little president man needs to stop being so grandiose about thinking that him and his doofus tribe of angry progressives are at all capable of deciding what kind of effect they want to have on the culture and then having that effect. It&#39;s simply not unmeaningful that the little president man&#39;s approval ratings are falling falling falling like Nancy Pelosi&#39;s fearful tears. People simply aren&#39;t that simple. Not even Americans.</p></span>

That&#39;s not precisely true. I just checked <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_obama_job_approval-1044.html#chart" rel="nofollow">the data</a> (which link, admittedly, provides a bullshit chart, since the notion of averaging out across polls to arrive at the truth is, obviously, stupid). Then there&#39;s <a href="http://washingtonindependent.com/59103/an-obama-bounce" rel="nofollow">this.</a></p>

<p>What do the figures look like if you account for regional differences? </p>

<p>More to the point, what does this have to do with anything?<br />
And, in re: &quot;what kind of effect they want to have on the culture and then having that effect,&quot; what is your theory of cultural change? Or, like climate change, do you simply not believe in it? Are you some kind of evo-psych nutjob instead of a Gramscian nutjob? Or do you work in the resistance/containment dynamic of New Historicist clichés? Pick your poison.</p>

<p>And, by the way, <i> Did they do that for reals?</i></p>

<p>Jackass, did you read the post?</p></span>

Not true. See links above.</p>

<p><i>Bush officials talked to church leaders and asked them to spread the word about the National Day of Prayer</i><br />
Oh, you&#39;re confused about whether Bush talked to church leaders and asked them to spread the word about the National Day of Prayer?<br />
That wasn&#39;t clear from what you wrote.</p>

<p>Well, let&#39;s hold your hand and walk you to a little door labeled Google. </p>

<p>Now, if we hold to the strict standard of whether Bush personally promoted the NDP by contacting particular churches, well, that&#39;s hard to prove, at least in the five minutes I&#39;m willing to give the research. But if the question can be heard as &#39;Did Bush give his approval to the National Day of Prayer by meeting with leaders of its task force (i.e., &#39;church leaders&#39;) at the White House,&#39; and &#39;was the task force during the Bush era restricting this unofficial government support to fundamentalist Christians and excluding moderate Christians, Muslims, and Jews,&#39; then the <a href="http://pewforum.org/news/display.php?NewsID=15466" rel="nofollow">answer</a> looks like <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0430/p01s02-usgn.html?page=2" rel="nofollow">yes.</a></p>

And you&#39;re stupid. And a bad speller. And lazy.</p>

<p>If my broker put me in the Obama fund in November 2008, I&#39;d fire her; if he bought in the last few weeks, I&#39;d be okay with that. Nonetheless, I still don&#39;t see what the presidential polling has to do with Scott&#39;s original post. Or really what it has to do with anything, since Obama&#39;s not currently running for any office. Could you explain that further?</p>

<p>And maybe I missed the bit where you explained what model of social change you believe in? The one, you know, that makes Presidential efforts to influence culture contemptible (since you&#39;re against presidents &quot;deciding what kind of effect they want to have on the culture and then having that effect&quot;)? I mean, most people thought FDR&#39;s fireside chats were kind of neat, whereas you, being a...doctrinaire Marxist who believes only in the potency of the base? being a object relations psychoanalyst who believes in longstanding influence of ego relations with the mother? a Jungian (you know, the woo-woo version of Evo-Psych)? what? ... think FDR&#39;s fireside chats, Bush&#39;s &#39;keep shopping,&#39; etc., deserve your contempt? </p>

<p>Frankly, I don&#39;t really get what you&#39;re driving at.</p>

<p>Or what you think was ok abt the Bush-era handling of the NDP.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t understand why you get calling Obama &quot;little.&quot; Bush, being only 5&#39; 11&quot; (and no doubt shrinking), is little. Obama, at 6&#39; 1&quot;, is a bit short, but generally not someone we&#39;d call &#39;little.&#39; Or do you mean this word in some sense other than a literal description of height or width? We need a little more explanation here.</p></span>

Anyway, HF is a performance art troll who argues, if you can call it that, in circles (e.g. &quot;if the ... president ... can&#39;t massage a basic approval rating out of people what have been stupefied by a supine dirty socialist media...&quot;) and has no respect for the English language as we know it. HF&#39;s only known goal is to keep you talking, getting more and more frustrated until you do or say something you regret, then cites it incessantly.</p>

<p>That said, who considers 6&#39;1&quot; &quot;a bit short&quot;? Shorter than what? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heights_of_United_States_Presidents_and_presidential_candidates" rel="nofollow">He&#39;s close to the norm for contemporary politicians</a>; the only President manifestly taller was Abraham Lincoln.</p></span>

The English language is not Ed Morrissey’s strong suit, and he at least makes a show of reining in the racist comments he knowingly baits from his audience.</strong> Update. If you came from over here, you need to note two things: first, that Patrick's only talking about the title of this post, which is odd, because in the body of the post the sarcasm of the title becomes absolutely clear. So clear, in fact, that my later clarification is really only for people who only read the title of this post. Second, Patrick completely ignores the argument of both this post and my clarification. Make what you will of his silence as regards anything other than the sarcastic title of this post. It seems Mr. Ed Morrissey caught President Obama fibbing again. See, Michelle Obama said this: I will never forget the time eight years ago when Sasha was four months that she would not stop crying. And she was not a crier, so we knew something was wrong. So we fortunately were able to take her to our pediatrician that next morning. He examined her and same something’s wrong. We didn’t know what. But he told us that she could have meningitis. So we were terrified. He said, get to the emergency room right away. Which the New York Times reported thus: In her speech, Mrs. Obama also told the story of how her daughter Sasha would not stop crying when she was 4 months old. A doctor’s visit revealed she might have meningitis; she ultimately did not, but the illness produced a scare. So far, so consistent: something was wrong with Sasha Obama; she was brought to a pediatrician; the pediatrician told her parents she could have meningitis and advised them to take her to the hospital. But Morrissey is suspicious because [i]n a speech to nurses just eight days earlier, Barack Obama told the story quite a bit differently (emphasis mine): When our youngest daughter, Sasha, was diagnosed with meningitis when she was just three months old, it was one of the scariest moments of my life. And we had to have a spinal tap administered and she ended up being in the hospital for three or four days. And it was touch and go, we didn’t know whether she’d be permanently affected by it. It was the nurses who walked us through what was happening and made sure that Sasha was okay. Well, she wasn’t diagnosed with meningitis. How hard is it to get the facts straight so that both Obamas tell the same story? I know what you’re thinking: this is the kind of close-reading I advocate doing in posts like this. Let it be known, however, that I do not believe paying close attention to language is enough: the conclusions drawn from that analysis abide by the basic rules of logic and the English language. So let me help Mr. Morrissey out: Michelle Obama said: So we fortunately were able to take her to our pediatrician that next morning. He examined her and same something’s wrong. We didn’t know what. But he told us that she could have meningitis. President Obama said:...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/a-new-literary-history-of-the-united-states-in-literature.html"><span><strong>A New Literary History of the United States in Literature</strong> The publication of A New Literary History of the United States will likely strike a few chords familiar to the participants in the debate that followed Rohan’s latest post. Written neither in the Emory Elliot mode—a history of items both literary and American—nor that of Sacvan Bercovitch—a history all items written by Americans that can be yours for the low, low price of $299.29—editors Greil Marcus and Werner Sollors instead decided to write a cultural history of the United States in a self-consciously literary voice. As Laura Miller at Salon* writes, the two have pitched the biggest tent conceivable, pegging each of the chronologically arranged essays in the book to “points in time and imagination where something changed: when a new idea or a new form came into being, when new questions were raised, when what before seemed impossible came to seem necessary or inevitable.” With this in mind, they’ve produced a compendium that is neither reference nor criticism, neither history nor treatise, but a genre-defying, transcendent fusion of them all. It sounds impossible, but the result seems both inevitable and necessary and profoundly welcome, too. This is, then, an anthology seemingly written to drive J.C. Hallman to drink, because it doggedly focuses on cultural significance over the literariness of the literary. However soul-deadening he might consider its subject matter, the manner in which most of it is written would likely meet with approval. Though idea-driven, the prose in Jonathan Lethem’s entry on Thomas Edison—in which he exclusively discusses the inventor’s place in film history—still sings: To watch the Edison films now, and those of the other production companies that joined him in the earliest phase of the film industry, is to discover a portal peering both backward and forward in cultural time. Even the most assiduous film buffs tend to begin with Charlie Chaplin, who appeared as a performer and made his first pictures as a fledgling director in 1914, or D. W. Griffith’s Birth of a Nation a year later. But the films that preceded those are as revelatory for their familiarity as their strangeness. Almost none presents a possibility that will fail to be exfoliated in the great boom to come, nor explores an avenue that runs anywhere but straight from the common cultural trove. A 120-second costumed Punch and Judy show like The Clown and the Alchemist (Edison Company, 1900), with its antic clown assisted in his abuses of the sententious alchemist by the use of stop-motion special effects, forms a lucid bridge between vaudeville and a Jim Carrey movie—The Mask, say. And watching the Selig Polyscope Company’s thirteen-minute 1910 version of The Wizard of Oz provides an uncanny sense of dislocation. Presenting a series of highlight moments derived from the popular stage version (adapted by L. Frank Baum, the novel’s author), the Selig Oz, in scenes of the Tin Man’s oiling, of the tale’s companions skipping arm in arm down a yellow brick road, and of the Wizard’s departure by balloon, seems a precognitive appropriation...</span></a></div>
