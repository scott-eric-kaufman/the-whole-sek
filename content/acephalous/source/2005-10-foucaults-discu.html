<p>Foucault didn't invent the social history, and his quarrels with the <em>Annales </em>school notwithstanding, his theory of discourse and its theory of <em>mentalities</em> spanning <em>la longue durée </em>share more assumptions than either party admits.&nbsp; But Foucault's approach hit the American scene at the height of dissatisfaction with the a-historical quality of American literary studies in its New Critical and post-structuralist incarnations.&nbsp; (Neither was nearly so a-historical as both accused the other of being.&nbsp; But that's not significant now.)&nbsp; So the adoption of Foucault by literary scholars has as much to do with his timeliness as the substance of his thought.&nbsp; His &quot;history&quot; bucked the historical stuffiness they thought retrogressive, so when the profession turned to &quot;history&quot; it couldn't help but slam into Foucault.&nbsp; His timing aside, the political nature of Foucault's post-1968 corpus appealed to the newly tenured and increasingly powerful (within the academy) former campus radicals.&nbsp; From here this account ventures in two different, but related, directions: it speaks to the problems with Foucault's historiography or it could address the adoption of those problems (and their dogged pessimism) by New Historicists.&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>Late Foucauldian Historiography</em></p>

<p>When I mentioned how Foucault employs Plato, Aristotle and Xenophon in <em>The Uses of Pleasure</em>, I deliberately elided his other major source, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_Laertius">Diogenes Laertius</a>, because Diogenes Laertius was not himself a philosopher so much as an historian of philosophy.&nbsp; His <em>Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers</em>, written sometime between 200 and 500 AD, is exactly the kind of source Foucault otherwise eschews.&nbsp; Whatever information it contains, based centuries old heresay, cannot be said to belong to Greek culture in the same manner as the work of Plato, Aristotle and Xenophon's did.&nbsp; So the infamous story about Diogenes the Cynic, as related by Diogenes Laertius somehwere in the ballpark of 300-600 hundred years after Diogenes the Cynic died, should speak to the culture moment of Diogenes Laertius and not that of Diogenes the Cynic.&nbsp; But in this case, Foucault accepts the validity of this historical account because, for lack of a better phrase, it is intellectually and argumentatively convenient for him to do so.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This bothers me.&nbsp; As does the fact that this post was meant to be nothing more than a preface to some cracks about the benefit of public masturbation.&nbsp; Instead it has become a rather windy whinge of suspect general interest.&nbsp; So don't read this.&nbsp; I'll the New Historicist angle tomorrow.&nbsp; I can't believe I suckered myself into spending an hour complaining about Foucault.&nbsp; <br /> </p>

I'll Show You Problems With Faulkner</strong> The following questions (presented without comment) were addressed to the Faulkner listserv by the brave soul in the process of translating Faulkner's Wild Palms into Chinese.

L5-7: How to understand the sentence: &quot;I'll plead my ass like they used to plead their bellies and nobody ever knows just where the truth is about a whore to convict any body.&quot; Please explain it.

While waiting for the former to process so that the lady at the latter's desk could perform her assigned task without frowning and huffing and asking whether it would be too much trouble to fill out this seventy-four page affidavit proving that I had already deposited all arms and legs owed the University of California Regents—while avoiding that, I wandered the third floor in search of a rare (during midterm week) empty cubicle. Finally I found one inhabited by a stack of books but sans any other scholarly elluvia, so I sat down to read some George Eliot. Two minutes passed before the shame of having possibly stolen some bathroom-bound undergraduate's cubicle drove me to look at the stack of books before me. A couple of Twayne's Guides to Sounding Like You've Actually the Read the Book and Mastered the Criticism, a copy of China Mieville's Looking for Jake and a copy of Adam Robert's Stone. I looked at that one suspiciously. &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;I know an Adam Roberts who writes science fiction novels.&quot; So I started reading it. Then I stopped... ...after an abosrbing hour. I put the book down, rescued my hostages from the untroubled inter-library loan lady and walked home. Then I ordered Stone. (Yes, I know, dissertation. And I'm on it. But Stone has passages in desperate need of underlining and, good egg that I am, I can't deface library property.) Plus, his new novel is a tribute to Y.T. called Land of the Headless. I expect those royalty checks to start streaming in any month now.</span></a></div>
