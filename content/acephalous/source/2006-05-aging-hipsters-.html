<p>IRVINE — Aging hipsters nationwide are fighting the urge to purchase two of the hottest new adult contemporary albums.&nbsp; Both albums—Paul Simon's <em>Surprise </em>and the Dixie Chicks' <em>Taking the Long Way</em>—boast producers who have what is called &quot;indie cred.&quot;&nbsp; At the helm of Simon's <em>Surprise </em>is the esteemed <span class="fronthead">Brian Peter George St. Baptiste de la Salle Eno.&nbsp; <br /></span></p>

<p><span class="fronthead">With the same deft hand responsible for such influential albums as <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00022M51I/diesekoschmar-20">Another Green World</a> </em>and <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1996/06/02/PK70006.DTL">The Microsoft Sound</a>, Eno updates Simon's sound for a new generation of listeners.&nbsp; According to Simon, &quot;I haven't sounded this fresh in since <em>Graceland</em>.&nbsp; I owe that entirely to Brian.&nbsp; His creepy atmospherics are the perfect counterbalance to my tendency to indulge in musical traditions I'm not altogether familiar with.&quot;</span></p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.amoebamusic.com/www.amoebamusic.com2/html/home.htm">Amoeba Records</a> in Los Angeles, a man in his late-twenties was seen clutching <em>Surprise </em>to a t-shirt celebrating Pavement's 1994 tour in support of <em>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</em>.&nbsp; &quot;I like Brian Eno,&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;You going to use my name in this?&nbsp; 'Cause my girlfriend would flip.&nbsp; But seriously, listen to the 'How Can You Live in the Northeast' or 'Everything About It Is a Love Song' and tell me that's not classic Eno.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They should have started collaborating in the Seventies,&quot; said another Amoeba patron.&nbsp; &quot;The lyrics even have that corny Seventies environmentalist thing going on.&nbsp; I can almost see that <a href="http://www.retrojunk.com/details_commercial/499/">indian tear up</a> when I listen to it.&quot;</p>

<p>The same cannot be said for the new Dixie Chicks album.&nbsp; &quot;The Seventies?&quot; asked one of the legion of <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/">Atrios</a> readers who pre-purchased the album.&nbsp; &quot;More like the mid-Nineties.&nbsp; They brought in members of Semisonic, the Jayhawks, and got Rick Rubin to produce.&nbsp; So long as they hate Bush and it don't sound like the Dixie Chicks, it'll be awesome.&quot;</p>

<p>Rubin has acquired a reputation for transforming marginal acts into popular crossover sensations.&nbsp; He has worked with everyone from L.L. Cool J., the Beastie Boys, Rage Against the Machine, System of a Down, Johnny Cash, Weezer and the Mars Volta.&nbsp; He decided to work with the Dixie Chicks for the challenge.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&quot;People thought I wouldn't be able to re-mainstream Neil Diamond, but you've seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0239948/"><em>Saving Silverman</em></a>, right?&nbsp; Have you heard Johnny Cash's '<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQECQOSBrPY">Hurt</a>'?&nbsp; Has anyone ever covered a song better?&nbsp; Have you ever seen a better video?&nbsp; People expect me to perform miracles.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>According to that guy over there in the beaten Chuck Taylors and fashionably weathered jeans, he just may have succeeded.&nbsp; &quot;You can actually hear Gary Louris on four of the songs.&nbsp; And the harmonies are sort of pretty sometimes.&nbsp; What's this in my hand you ask?&nbsp; The latest TV on the Radio album.&nbsp; Heard of them?&nbsp; Didn't think so.&nbsp; I'm still cool.&nbsp; Stop laughing.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Gary Louris does sing harmony on &quot;Everybody Knows.&quot;&nbsp; Given Rubin's penchant for trenchant covers, one would expect it to be a cover of Leonard Cohen's immortal &quot;Everybody Knows.&quot;&nbsp; Or Concrete Blonde's incredible cover of Cohen's tune from <em>Pump Up the Volume</em>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&quot;People would think that.&nbsp; But I'm all about defying expectations.&nbsp; Look at who's buying <em>Taking the Long Way</em>,&quot; said Rubin, who initially wanted the album named <em>The Long Cut</em>.&nbsp; </p>

		<span id="comment-17767489-content"><p>My honest appraisal?  It&#39;s a sonically interesting album, but Eno&#39;s been there a thousand times before.  Simon&#39;s lyrics?  They haven&#39;t been worth the price of admission in some time, but he&#39;s still clever enough on occasion.  (All occasions on this album, however, are strictly of the &quot;GRANDPA DOESN&#39;T UNDERSTAND CELL-PHONES!&quot; variety.  What makes it worth it buying is how seamlessly Simon and Eno work together, and how well each of their established styles complements the other.  I joke above, but had these two hooked up in the &#39;70s, who knows what could&#39;ve happened.  </p></span>

<p>Young man, &quot;aging hipster&quot; and &quot;late twenties&quot; do not belong in the same sentence - unless, of course, suitable quotation marks are provided.  Unironic aging hipsters would be the bikers I knew in Denmark: the cyclone of history picked them up in 1968 and regurgitated them untouched at the ByFest in 1996.<br />

		<span id="comment-17808457-content"><p>You know, after hearing two or three selections from Paul Simon&#39;s newest album on an NPR interview/broadcast, I can honestly say that there are some places he shouldn&#39;t go... and this is one of those places. While I have a soft spot for the Eno/Lanois-esque sound, it&#39;s just wrong for Paul Simon. (&quot;Wartime Prayers&quot; is nothing less than embarrasingly sophomoric; the sincerity is surprisingly suffocating, and the music boring.) Have his merry percussionists abandonated him altogether? Is he now &quot;become Green Day&quot;?</p>

Story at 10.</strong> [X-posted] Scott Eric Kaufman boards a flight to Houston, TX. He stumbles into his aisle seat and opens his backpack. He pulls a stack of papers from it. Because he needs new glasses, the name “McCann” is emblazoned in 14 point font across the top of first page. Across the aisle sits a svelte young man clad all in black reading a Vintage International paperback. He glances at Scott, then at the stack, then returns to his book. The plane taxies down the runway and takes off. Svelte Young Man: (leans into the aisle) What are you reading? Scott: An essay a friend of mine sent me. Svelte Young Man: What’s it about? Scott: Getrude Stein, mostly, but it has a bit about evolutionary theory in it. Svelte Young Man: ‘Cause I noticed it said “McCann” on it. Is it by Sean McCann? Scott: Actually, it is. Svelte Young Man: One of my professors told me to check out his work. Smart stuff. Did you know he writes for this online thing? Scott: Actually… Svelte Young Man: It’s called “The Valve.” Smart stuff. I can give you the address. You should really look it up. Scott: Actually, I write for the Valve too. My name’s Scott Kaufman. (offers hand) Svelte Young Man: (stares blankly) Scott: I’ve been writing there a while. Sean and I are friends. Svelte Young Man: (continues to stare blankly) Scott: (feeling like a busted liar) No, really, I do. Did you read the text adventure parody? Svelte Young Man: Uh, no. Scott: Any of the stuff about Darwin? Svelte Young Man: (visibly uncomfortable) Not that I remember. Scott: (feeling increasingly busted) I post there all the time. Svelte Young Man: Well, I don’t read the comments... It’s all downhill from there. Scott slowly withdraws his long outstretched hand. He never manages to get the guy’s name, but he does learn (albeit indirectly) that the recommendation to track Sean down came, in all likelihood, from Mark McGurl. He posts this in the hope that the anonymous guy who thinks Scott a liar will read this. Because really, I mean, most of y’all complain he posts too much, no?</span></a></div>

Like I'd been hit by a truck. Or an enthusiastically riced Honda Civic. Like this one. Only darker. Its owner revved its engine and backed out at 90. I placed my right hand on its unnecessary spoiler, pushed myself into the air, slammed into the back windshield, then its owner threw it into drive and I rolled off the back windshield and onto the parking lot. I heard it gun its engines and watched it drive away. I was still clutching the bag of cat food. My iRiver was still in my pocket, but I could neither feel nor find my headphones. A kind man dropped his groceries and ran to me and asked if I needed any help. He said, &quot;Do you need any help?&quot; I said, &quot;I don't think so.&quot; He said, &quot;I didn't catch the license number.&quot; I said, &quot;Me neither.&quot; He said, &quot;Are you sure you're alright? Do you need a lift?&quot; I said, &quot;No, I live right up there.&quot; Then I walked home. I felt my heart pounding through my shoulder. I climbed three flights of stairs. It was fun. I opened the door and put the bag of cat food in the tin. I poured and drank a stiff drink. I walked into the Little Womedievalist's office and informed her I'd sort of been hit by a car in the parking lot. I said, &quot;I was sort of hit by a car in the parking lot.&quot; She said, &quot;Are you alright?&quot; I said, &quot;The man asked that too. I was fine then but I feel sort of strange now.&quot; She said, &quot;What do you mean 'sort of strange'?&quot; I said, &quot;Like I don't know.&quot; She said, &quot;We should call someone.&quot; I called Albertson's and asked if they had cameras pointed in the parking lot. The woman on the phone said they didn't because the parking lot belonged to the Irvine Company. I called the Irvine Company. The message said, &quot;Business hours had ended.&quot; I hung up and called back. I listened to the message again. I wrote down the number of the private security company Irvine employees to watch over Albertson's parking lot. I called them. The dispatcher informed me that she was only a dispatcher and didn't know if there were cameras. She said their security guard left at 7 p.m. and wouldn't return until 3 p.m. on Saturday. She recommended I call the police. I called the police station next to my apartment complex. I told the officer what happened. He said I needed to call the Irvine police because Albertson's is across the street. I called the Irvine police. They said they would send someone out. I brushed my teeth and calmed the wife. I began to feel sort of stranger in my lower back. I sat down on the couch with excellent posture and watched Pedro lose...</span></a></div>
