        <meta name="description" content="Two stray lines in the Wired review of Star Trek and my befuddlement at the season finale of Fringe (&quot;There's One More Of Everything&quot;) disappeared: Abrams, with his go-to writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (Fringe, Mission: Impossible III), came up with a clever enough solution. Using the well-worn Star Trek gimmick of time travel, they would establish a new universe for the old characters to play in—while preserving the adventures of Gene Roddenberry’s original series in their own time line. Orci and Kurtzman wrote Star Trek and the season finale and the season finale of Fringe.

(Here there be spoilers.) Brief synopsis: Two Harvard lab partners (John Noble's Walter Bishop and Leonard Nimoy's before-this-episode unseen-but-frequently-mentioned William Bell) experiment on children and give them the ability to locate the weak points between contiguous universes.

The season finale revisits a character with the ability to teleport (Jared Harris' chilling David Robert Jones), only now he seems to be able to throw open the barn door between continguous universes.

Walter cannot remember what that is but makes an offhand remark that the last time he and Peter were in that lake house Peter was very sick. Peter responds, &quot;I don't remember being very sick.&quot; Why not? Because as we learn when Walter goes to the cemetary Peter died when he was seven years old. That would be the precious thing Walter lost the last time he went to the lake house. Then who is the Peter Bishop who hasn't been dead the past quarter century?

<p>Very good ideas, those are.  I wonder if their popularity plays into the suits not pulling Abrams aside and saying, &quot;Look, we love you J.J., but people are gonna catch on if you keep this up.&quot;  The needs of the now outweighing the needs of tomorrow and all.  As for the underemployed creative types, well, I think suits are all about milking the sure things for as long as they&#39;re sure things.  Those unknown people?  Fuckwads, every last one of the---wait, you have a great idea for a popular new series?  Have I told you, lately, that I love you?</p>

<p><em>You don&#39;t have any thoughts on Lost, do you? I think I&#39;m actually lost this time around...</em></p>

<p>They&#39;re sitting on the DVR right now.  Like you, I got baffled, but I figured it was a product of watching a television show like a television show, instead of how it&#39;s supposed to be watched: as a DVD collection of an entire series.  So I started squirreling them away last month and will blitz through the last five episodes one night.  If I can make heads of tails of it---actually, when I can&#39;t make heads or tails of it, as with <em>Fringe</em>---I&#39;ll write it up.</p></span>

In Star Trek the alternate reality is unidirectional.  Original Spock is in a reality not his own because of time travel and he is unable to rejoin his own reality.  This creates a meta issue of continuity between the original and the new.  </p>

<p>In Fringe the idea is that the people in different dimensions are in fact moving concurrently in a way that allows people to cross back and forth.  That both of them are using a kind of parallel universe conceit doesn&#39;t mean that they are the same plot element.  The implications are completely different. </p></span>

Which is fine because, as Russell Arben Fox notes, the new Star Trek film manifestly works. I don't share the qualms Timothy Burke and his commenters are expressing over the continuity issues raised by the film, because I care more about quality than continuity. Moreover, I think what Abrams did there was damn clever. (If you ain't seen the film but will this is where you should stop reading.) As every critic has said, the casting was inspired. We didn't see Chris Pine playing Shatner playing Kirk or Zachary Quinto playing Nimoy playing Spock; moreover, the ensemble cast related to each other in a manner consistent with the original. I think this is a testament to J.J. Abrams, who has proven, again and again, to have a deft touch with ensembles: Alias, Lost, Fringe. Even when the stories break down into nonsense, the interaction of his characters remain a compelling reason to keep watching. (Or so I tell myself for sticking with Alias two years longer than any sane man should.) Why am I talking about the cast when I said I'd be talking about continuity? Because this cast had the task of replacing icons. There can always be another Bond or Batman. But another Kirk or Spock? You need to do more than cast a Spock-alike to convince an audience for whom Nimoy is Spock that Quinto can fill the role. Which isn't to say Quinto doesn't look like a young Leonard Nimoy at times. Because he does. Frighteningly so. But looking like Nimoy isn't the same thing as being Spock. So what did Abrams do? He made himself another Spock. The Spock who witnessed a Genocide Effect and may never stare down the Genesis Device. Who knows what the future holds for this Spock? No one . . . all the old stories belong to the crews of different Enterprises exploring a different universe. By introducing a new timeline, Abrams need neither bend nor buckle under the burden of history. Fans of the original continuity keep what they have (mostly) intact, whereas new fans—charmed by the new cast and new direction—are introduced to the franchise via a plot contrivance that allows them to understand why all the previous series and films seem to exist in a different universe. By making the breaking of the continuity the central plot point of the first reboot, Abrams ensures that new fans won't be confused when they hear, for example, that Kirk had a long and healthy relationship with his father. This strikes me as a genius move.</span></a></div>

(Can you tell I didn't walk? Can you?) So if you comment and I don't reply or seem to be sending email into an abyss, it's only because I won't have regular internet access until next Monday. But you have to congratulate my sister. Her name is Sarah. She's not a natural student but struggled her damnedest every semester and is graduating tomorrow. So congratulate her already.
