<p><a href="http://bloodandtreasure.typepad.com/blood_treasure/2005/10/nasty_sordid_fr.html">Jamie</a> reports on rampant postwar British randiness.&nbsp; Said BBC Magazine commenter Darren: &quot;My nan reguarly gets tipsy at christmas and proceeds to inform the

wherever they may be, even if miles away, will feel its call stronger
and more compelling than any temptation.&quot;&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; &quot;The toll of V.D. must be arrested, and it is we wives and mothers who can do much to help.&quot;&nbsp; If all else fails, there's always the desert:<br /> </p>

<p><a href="http://johnmckay.blogspot.com/2005/10/map-nerd-of-arabia-im-map-nerd-as.html">John McKay</a> examines the contours of T.E.

<p><a href="http://www.froginawell.net/japan/2005/10/some-differing-approaches/">K.M. Lawson</a> demonstrates the importance of working from multiple sources by means of an extended dialogue between various histories about the Japanese annexation of Korea.&nbsp; That the Japanese annexed a country in possession of a perfect alphabet (according to <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002529.html">Language Log</a>) is quite the technological achievement.&nbsp; There may not seem to be any hard and fast connection between military prowess and an alphabet with no subphonemic distinctions, but that's only because there aren't any.&nbsp; <em>Or are there?&nbsp; </em>No, there really aren't.&nbsp; But that doesn't mean there's no connection between conquests military or spirital and matters linguistic or literary:<br /> </p>

<p>The intimacy of historical and literary traditions comes to the fore in <a href="http://earmarks.org/archives/2005/10/12/12">Kristine Steenbergh</a>'s explication of Clifford's &quot;mourn in steel&quot; in <em>Henry VI</em>.&nbsp; Citing Robert N. Watson's suggestion that when &quot;prayers for the dead were discouraged in churches...revenge on behalf of a ghost would be performed in theatres,&quot; Steenbergh recounts the historical logic behind the sudden popularity of revenge plays.&nbsp; I find the suggestion fascinating—the very manner of historical explanation for the formal properties of a literary text I strive mightily to create in my own work—and would love to press her to explain this transformation in more detail.&nbsp; That said, <a href="http://blog.lib.umn.edu/archives/robe0419/coffee/028852.html">Evan Roberts</a> reminds us that there are other more pedestrian <em>but no less important </em>forms of literary leg work available.&nbsp; Speaking of feet and legs and arms and other skeletal material:<br /> </p>



<p>John Hawkes updates his <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/flores/liang_bua.html">earlier</a> entry on skeletal material from Liang Bua in a <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/flores/flores_update_oct_2005.html">series</a> of <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/flores/weber_microcephaly_comment_2005.html">posts</a>.&nbsp; His extended discussion <em>Homo floresiensis</em>—or <em>Hobbit habilis</em>, had Hawkes had his druthers—should interest historians (and historians of science) for numerous reasons, foremost among them the dialogue carried out between evidence and theory.&nbsp; (This debate may interest me more than most because I'm writing a dissertation in which 19th Century theories of <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/how_to_open_an__1.html">speciation</a> play a significant part.&nbsp; That said, watching Hawkes work through the evidence—countering probable scenarios with possible then possible with probable in a spectacular display of reasoning through the evidence—has something valuable to say to anyone who stares at piles of evidence, written or otherwise, and wonders how best to sift through them.)&nbsp; Of course, <a href="http://www.bioteach.ubc.ca/quarterly/?p=33">Justin Kahn</a> could settle this debate in an instant, but he has papers to steal and Santayana to quote.&nbsp; (Kahn's also on <a href="http://students.ou.edu/D/David.M.Davisson-1/2005/10/history-of-mr-wells.html">David Davisson</a>'s short-list for October's &quot;Patron Saint of Patahistory.&quot;&nbsp; An important fellow, President Kahn is.&nbsp; How to best worship him?&nbsp; We could take a page from <a href="http://www.philipharland.com/Blog/2005/10/new-study-on-imperial-cults-worship-of.html">Phil Harland</a>'s books and worship our &quot;Revered One&quot; Roman-style.)</p>

<p>When he finishes divesting himself of all his shares of ExxonMircoMobileSoft and officially accepts the Sceptor of Supreme Leader of the United Continents of the Americas, S.L.U.C.A. Kahn could help <a href="http://1543.typepad.com/copernicus_sashimi/2005/10/percy_harrison_.html">Sylwester Ratowt</a> find Percy Harrison Fawcett, the gentleman naturalist who lost himself while trying to find the lost city of Z.&nbsp; Or he could use his Supreme Ultimate Fiat to declare &quot;.&quot; a shorter sentence than &quot;<a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002480.html">Z.</a>&quot;&nbsp; (It is supreme <em>and </em>ultimate after all.)&nbsp; Or maybe he has too much work to do: lives to save in grand coincidental fashion, as <a href="http://www.daytondailynews.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/dayton/education/entries/2005/10/13/good_vs_evil_an.html">Scott Elliot</a> reports; complete copies of Presocratic papyri to smuggle to pacify <a href="http://archaeoastronomy.co.uk/?p=533">Alun Salt</a>; and sooner of later he will have to ease <a href="http://airminded.org/2005/10/09/r101-75-years-on/">Brett Holman</a>'s mind and right the R101 disaster.&nbsp; But our Overlord cannot be in all places at once.&nbsp; Case in point: I still remember the Civil War.&nbsp; So does everyone else:</p>

<p><a href="http://warhistorian.org/blog/index.php?entry=entry051009-083902">Mark Grimsley</a>'s review of <em>The Memory of the Civil War in American Culture </em>addresses the impact of the &quot;American Iliad&quot; on American culture.&nbsp; Starting from the paraphrased premise the &quot;public memory&quot; is &quot;a fable agreed upon,&quot; Grimsely traces the way the volume's contributors imagine that negotiation having happened and speculates how it may be improved upon.&nbsp; <a href="http://scottneigh.blogspot.com/2005/10/review-black-canadians.html">Scott Neigh</a> wishes Joseph Mensah's <em>Black Canadians: History, Experience and Social Conditions </em>contained the same quality of historical investigation for which Grismley praised <em>The Memory of the Civil War in American Culture</em>, but concedes that the chapter it did spend delineating Canada's colonial heritage well-written and informative.&nbsp; On the subject of Canada:</p>

<p>I once lived there in a place called Ft. McMurray.&nbsp; That was to be my clever transition to my own contribution to this History Carnival, but a quick scan of my posts from the past two weeks reveals no viable candidates.&nbsp; So no entry from the host.&nbsp; In its stead I present to you <a href="http://fascinatinghistory.blogspot.com/2005/10/salacious-life-of-casanova.html">Alterior</a>'s account of the appeal of Casanova and let you make of this juxtaposition whatever you like.&nbsp; (It should be noted though that I don't need Papal dispensation to purchase my pornographic books.&nbsp; My copy of <em>Ulysses </em>came straight from the Noble Lord Barnes.)<br /> </p>

<p>This Carnival closes with a dose of meta-Carnival blogging.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2005/10/the_blog_the_ca.html">Ben Vershbow</a> follows Henry Farrell's &quot;<a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v52/i07/07b01401.htm">The Blogosphere as a Carnival of Ideas</a>&quot;
with a simple question: Henry, given the title of your article, why did
you neglect to mention &quot;the phenomenon of the 'blog carnival,' an
interesting subculture of the web that has been adopted in certain
academic, or semi-academic, circles&quot;?&nbsp; Since Henry's an occasional
reader here, perhaps he'll answer the question himself.</p>

<p>The next installment of the History Carnival will be hosted by Rebecca Goetz at <a href="http://rebecca-goetz.blogspot.com/">(a)musings of a grad student</a>.&nbsp; Email potential entries to: </p>

But be careful. The china's expensive and the cats bolt for the door. That said, the house recommends the posts to your immediate right labelled &quot;Would That They Were Representative.&quot; If you prefer a drubbing of a different sort, let me suggest Michael Berube's entry on Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen and his nearly depleted wrong reserves. UPDATE: Alright, I know that you and I agree that &quot;conservatives&quot; (however &quot;we&quot; define the term, i.e. despite our differences) are the Devil, but I'm more than a little disappointed that 3,719 people have reconnoitred these environs and not a single person has taken issue with anything I wrote. Stop the self-congratulatory applause. No one here will pat you on the back. Surely you know that while the statement the committee made with the Pinter decision is a strong one. But if they've at all been influenced by his recent poetry then they've compromised their standards and have degraded the legacies of previous award winners. Again, not to say that I disagree Pinter's position on the war in Iraq, but given the quality of his work since he's &quot;retired,&quot; sound reasons for criticism abound. As Scott McLemee (someone you all should read) said: This award makes sense only as a foreign-policy editorial disguised as a literary prize. McLemee's as snugly left as you or I, but he has the balls to be honest about the decision. I only say this because, while I appreicate the link and the overwhelming amount of traffic accompanying it, there's an annoying sense of rallying 'round the banner to the criticism of conservative criticism of Pinter's selection. He wrote brilliantly about contemporary issues thirty years ago. But since he's &quot;quit&quot; the literary business for the pundit racket he's been hit-or-miss: &quot;hit&quot; on the Iraq debacle, yes, but &quot;miss Miss MISS!&quot; on Milošević. And the quality of his work of late, as I indicated when I mocked both LGF commenter &quot;Carolyn&quot; and Pinter for the substance of and response to &quot;American Football.&quot; In other words, those on the Left (Old, New, Radical, Über-Radical, or what-not) need to not wear the blinders of their brethren on the Right; they need to differentiate between legitimate criticism of artist's work and the stupidity of those who would pride themselves on reading naught but Dan Brown. The Left is as impotent as ever, and no amount of self-congratulation will change that.</span></a></div>

More read Instapundit. I've already replaced the wheel on that counter twelve times this weekend.] Six years in California acclimates you. There I sit at the desk pictured left (albeit in its embarrassinly cluttered mid-quarter state) when all of the books I've added to the piles you see start to sway. My mind invariably turns first to the prospect of cats wrestling where cats ought not be wresting. Then I turn to the bed and see all four cats, ears perked, tales interrogative, seeking the source of this sudden shaking and it occurs to me that I'm experiencing what the natives call an &quot;earth quake.&quot; Everything slows down. Things sway slowly and ignoring the unverisal impulse to survive I shout &quot;I think the earth itself protests!&quot; The wife shouts back her quick concur and the next thing you know we're staring at each other from opposite ends of the hall thinking the same thought: Is this someone else's The Big One? It isn't. (Not today at least.) But in honor of the small one located 49 miles SSE of San Clemente Island, I present the following quotations from John McPhee's magisterial Annals of the Former World: As we could plainly see from the interstate, the rock now residing in that striped mountainside had once been brutally shoved around—shoved, not pulled, and with such force that a large part of it had been tipped up more than ninety degrees, to and well beyond the vertical. Overturned. Such violence can happen on an epic scale. There is an entire nation in Europe that is upside down. (50) The declivity was by no means sheer, just steep—a steepness, I judged, that would have caused the vehicle, had it slipped off the road, to go end over end enveloped in flame at a hundred yards a bounce. (106) On the striated pavement of Algeria lies the till of polar glaciers. there are tropical atolls in Canada, tropical limestones in Siberia, tropical limestones in Antarctica. (115) Certain English geologists produced confusion by embracing continental drift and then drawing up narratives and maps that showed continents moving all over the earth with respect to a fixed and undriftable England. (118) The swelling up of mountains was described as an orogeny. Ontogeny, phylogenry, orogeny—accent syllable two. The Antler Orogeny, the Avalonian Orogeny, the Taconic, Acadian, Alleghenian Orogenies. the Laramide orogeny. The center of the United States had had a dull geologic history—nothing much being accumulated, nothing much being eroded away. It was just sitting there conservatively. The east had once been radical—had been unstable, reformist, revolutionary, in the paleozoic pulses of three or four orogenies. Now, for the last hundred and fifty million years, the east had been stable and conservative. The far-out stuff was in the far west of the country—wild, weirdsma, with its welded tuffs and Franciscan melange (internally deformed, complex beyond analysis). (32) And that, children, is why we stand in doorways when we feel the...</span></a></div>
