<p>I try not to pay attention to Glenn Beck, but even when I have, I never really <em>paid attention</em> to him.  But when an old friend, someone I genuinely respect, forwarded  me a link to Beck’s archive and dared me to refute his logic, I decided  it might be time to try.</p>
<p><em>Bad decision</em>.</p>
<p>As someone who’s studied linguistics and taught journalism, I know  that spoken language differs significantly from written and resist  judging speakers for not speaking in complete sentences or organizing  their thoughts into coherent paragraphs.  That said, it should still  possess some underlying logic, which is why this transcript from his <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,602243,00.html">November 19th</a> program requires an airing out.  It begins by preying on lunatic fears of a One World Government:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a little bug inside of me, too, and it wants to  stop control-hungry progressives from running our lives and pushing us  into a giant global system of government. You know, the kind of global  government that [Jay Rockefeller&#39;s] dad liked so much.  [David  Rockefeller] was a globalist and had a wonderful vision of the future of  our world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, just in case his audience was insufficiently terrified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel a little uncomfortable. We’ll talk about preparing for—let’s just leave it at that, being prepared.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note how, in a classic bit of demagoguery, he stops himself just  short the moment of revelation.  People fear what they don’t know,  especially when they’re being told, in ominous tones, that the unknown  requires preparation and is connected, somehow, to the “shadowy” or  “spooky” forces of the One World Government.  Those adjectives don’t  appear in that particular quotation, but they appear later, and  frequently, especially with regards to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>George Soros, [whose] daddy was a globalist as well. He  believed in something called Esperanto. Esperanto is a made up language.  It was designed for a one world government. It started in the 1890s,  1880s. And he was fluent in it. I mean, he wrote a book in Esperanto for  one world government. Later, George Soros started his Open Society  Institute. The main goal of the Open Society Institute was really that  of his father’s: to create a world free of nationalities—one world  government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I knew, in the vague way that everyone who follows politics knows,  that Beck believes that lines on a chalkboard have the force of logic.  I  did not, however, appreciate that he was trafficking in full-throated  conspiracy theories about the imminent invasion of the forces of the One  World Government.  Put differently, I expected to find moments, like  the following, in which Beck discovered in the world connections that  only exist in his head:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soros explains the anti-capitalist, pro-Marxist tactics  he uses to fundamentally transform countries. They are the dreams of his  father—which is weird because that’s almost the title of Barack Obama’s  book, <em>The Dreams From My Father</em>. His daddy, by all accounts  was a communist, at least an anti-colonialist, as was his grandfather.   The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m sure his audience didn’t realize that the connective tissue of  his argument is that Soros and Obama both had fathers with dreams.  You  know who else had a dream?  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1242113/">An episode of <em>Dexter</em></a>, which is about a serial killer, which means that Obama is in grave danger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>George Soros thinks he’s on the verge of [establishing  the One World Government]. He has collapsed economies and entire  currencies. They see it as possibly—possibly—falling apart. I told you  that I believed this show may have accelerated their timetable because  we’ve exposed them. But what if—what if they really do believe that  Barack Obama is not the guy to get it done?</p>
<p>These guys, this is a violent, revolutionary. This guy is a labor  union with millions of dollars and, also, a globalist. This guy—spooky  dude.</p>
<p>This is why I told you one of my longest-standing worries about  President Obama was not about the country, not about corruption. It was  about his safety and not because of the Tea Party people, but because  the minute these radicals, if they actually decide that Barack Obama is  not who he says he is, political danger is not his only concern.</p>
<p>I ask you again to pray for our Secret Service. Make sure our Secret  Service are watching inside and out. Pray for our president. As I see  it, there are a million things that could happen. That’s just one of  them. There’s a million things that can make the entire world fly apart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What, and then the Chinese will invade?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>China’s leaders know this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Seriously</em>?  Let me recount Beck’s argument for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Jay Rockefeller’s father supported a One World Government, which makes</p>
<p>2. Glenn Beck afraid, and as you should be, because</p>
<p>3. George Soros’s father wanted everyone to speak Esperanto,</p>
<p>4. And had a dream, which is something Obama’s father also had, meaning</p>
<p>5. If Soros is unable to fulfill his father’s dream</p>
<p>6. Obama will be assassinated and</p>
<p>7. China will invade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minus a bit about some lady finding a coat Beck’s father owned in a  Seattle pawn shop, this is the argument Beck proffered on November 19,  2010 and <em>it is premium-grade insane</em>.  I’m not talking “your  stated reasons for supporting tax cuts for the wealthy are disingenuous”  insane.  I’m talking “you couldn’t tell a premise from a conclusion if  one were labeled ‘premise’ and the other ‘conclusion’” insane.  His  disconnect from the world is either so cynical as to be sociopathic or  so fundamental as to be dissociative.</p>
<p>Needless to say, after reading all that and writing all this, I have one less friend on Facebook.</p>

<p>And honestly, I&#39;m not about to interact with anyone who thinks <em>that</em> has explanatory power.  I only hope it came across that I wasn&#39;t just mocking Beck, but actually following his argument, such that it is, as I would one in one of the 3,192 essays I&#39;ve received today.</p></span>

<p>Whether you believe in it or not, it exists. </p>

<p><i>Esperanto is a made up language.</i></p>

<p>As opposed to those organic languages which we dug out of the earth, or grew in free-range pens. Esperanto is derived from existing languages, so it&#39;s not like Klingon or Elvish or Morse Code.</p>

<p><i>It was designed for a one world government.</i></p>

<p>It was designed to make communication easier and increase human comity. Government had nothing whatsoever to do with it. Why is he so afraid of people actually talking to each other?</p>

Over the course of the conversation, which the man was secretly recording, Ploshnick never mentioned how, back in 1997, she’d thrown herself between her special education students and an out-of-control van and suffered severe injuries that still pain her today, nor did she mention the letter she received from President Clinton praising her for her actions that afternoon. She did inform the man that the state of tenure in New Jersey is such that she once witnessed another teacher—one who is not an award-winning, student-lives-saving special education teacher—yell “You nigger!” at a student, and that this other teacher was merely demoted. This man, who had plied her with drinks, as a professional journalist should, and recorded her words without her knowledge, as a professional journalist should, then brought the tape of Ploshnick recounting what happened to another teacher to James O’Keefe, who then posted it, with captions, on the Project Veritas Youtube channel. The relevant moment looks like this: In response to criticism that followed Ploshick being suspended and docked a pay raise for recounting what another teacher had said, Project Veritas posted a video in which it prefaced her comments with this: That’s right: O’Keefe and company claim that the word “nigger” is so volatile that there is no context capable of mitigating its appearance in response to a video in which they captioned someone thus: No context can mitigate its appearance, it seems, unless that context is “targeting an award-winning, student-lives-saving special education teacher for matters of political convenience.” Put differently: If you believe anything even resembling the title of this post, you are a terrible person and never to be taken seriously again.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/11/how-not-to-help-your-cause.html"><span><strong>How not to help your cause</strong> Turns out one of Goldstein's brood took exception to my previous post and attempted to refute it by making a series of patently idiotic claims. For example: But Scott could at least have had the sense to not admit profound ignorance on what Beck ever says. I’m not surprised, though, because I know that for Serious People like SEK, admitting that he pays attention to the likes of Glenn Beck would collapse any credibility he may have among those whose good graces he desires to be in. Your eyes don't deceive you: the argument is, in fact, that criticizing Glenn Beck would &quot;collapse any credibility [I] may have among those whose good graces [I] desire to be in.&quot; Because we all know left-leaning academics who criticize far-right lunatics are shunned by their colleagues. Further depressing my credibility is my intellectual honesty, which here takes the form of my admission, up front, that I'm not a regular viewer of the show. Note, though, that the claim is that I admitted a &quot;profound ignorance on what Beck ever says,&quot; which is strange because I did no such thing. I wrote: I try not to pay attention to Glenn Beck, but even when I have, I never really paid attention to him. That's &quot;passing familiarity,&quot; not &quot;profound ignorance,&quot; and the difference between the two should be obvious, and is, unless your refutation of my post continues thus: You see, all of the topics that Glenn addresses–the dots that Scott attempts to connect–are topics that Glenn has has talked about at length in the past, so when he mentions this or that, he’s harking back to discussions he’s already had, discussions that most of the people watching have already heard. Translation: &quot;All the dots Scott connected have been connected in the past, and this refutes his argument somehow.&quot; How exactly? Like so: See, what Glenn has said in the past about the Chinese is that unlike us, they plan waaaaay far ahead. They have contingency plans and stuff. And they’re looking to achieve hegemony in Asia and maybe more. Glenn has NEVER said that the Chinese plan to invade the U.S. So his fear-mongering concerning the Chinese is related to their desire to &quot;achieve hegemony in Asia and maybe more.&quot; That's some non-ominous &quot;maybe more&quot; there, and the fact that it didn't issue from his mouth only makes my point stronger: he's inculcated his Fear of a Yellow Planet in his audience so successfully that even when they attempt to claim that his fears are fact-based and rational the fruits of his irrational speculation appear. To wit: Glenn has expressed this fear for a long time. He posits that a lot of powerful radicals, financed by Soros cash, are counting on Obama to fulfill their political wish list, but that if he proves to be unable or unwilling to do so, they’ll take him out. Claiming that he's &quot;posit[ed]&quot; something sans evidence for &quot;a long time&quot; doesn't disprove my argument that he engages in...</span></a></div>
