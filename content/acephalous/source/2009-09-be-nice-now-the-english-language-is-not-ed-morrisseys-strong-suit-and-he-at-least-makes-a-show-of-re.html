<p><strong>Michelle Obama said</strong>: So we fortunately were able to take her to our pediatrician that next morning. He examined her and same something’s wrong. We didn’t know what. But he told us that she could have meningitis.</p>
<p><strong>President Obama said:</strong> When our youngest daughter, Sasha, was diagnosed with meningitis when she was just three months old[.]</p></blockquote>
<p>In his fever to catch the President in a lie, Mr. Morrissey neglects to notice that Michelle Obama said that <em>the pediatrician diagnosed Sasha as possibly having meningitis</em>, at which point Sasha was taken to the hospital to have a spinal tap administered in order <em>to confirm the diagnosis</em>. Mr. Morrissey, it seems, is just another Edmund Premington:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><span style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; DISPLAY: block">
<object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0cO5JUrLomw&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;hd=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" />
 <embed allowfullscreen="true" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0cO5JUrLomw&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;hd=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" wmode="transparent" /> </object></span></p>
<p>Like Premington, Mr. Morrissey’s problems with comprehension are based on a gross deformity—only in this case intellectual instead of bodily. He cannot understand that when the First Lady says the pediatrician “told us that [Sasha] could have meningitis,” that constituted a <em>diagnosis</em>. On the basis of that diagnosis, the pediatrician told them “get to the emergency room right away” where, according to the President, Sasha had “a spinal tap administered and she ended up being in the hospital for three or four days.” Far from there being a <em>lie</em>, there isn’t even a <em>discrepancy</em> there: you are diagnosed with Malady X, sent to the hospital for confirmation, then treated for <em>whatever is wrong with you</em>, even if it differs from the initial diagnosis. In short, the validity of the pediatrician’s diagnosis is immaterial—the fact that it was made is all that matters..</p>
<p>For example, in the summer of 2004 a doctor diagnosed with me and treated for a mild case of depression. A few months later, <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/how-sek-hid-can.html">my throat swelled up</a> and a different doctor diagnosed me with thyroid cancer. In both cases, I was diagnosed. If I say that I was diagnosed with mild depression in the summer of 2004, nothing that happened subsequently would make me a liar for stating it <em>because that is the way logic and the English language work</em>.</p>
<p>Either Mr. Morrissey and his commenters don’t know from logic or the English language, or they are being deliberately dense to score the cheapest of political points. The idea, as I understand it, is to toss meat into the thin gruel of Joe Wilson’s cooking because every little bit adds some body to the soup. However, Mr. Morrissey and his ilk care little how any individual ingredient contributes to the flavor, because no matter what anyone tosses in there, the last step of the recipe calls for adding two parts ungranulated racism for every one part of liquid:</p>
<blockquote>

Does she not know that when she wears things like that it makes her hips and a$$ look large. Like she doesn’t have enough junk in that trunk</a>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It would have been worse, but as Mr. Morrissey’s commenters complain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/18/michelle-obama-on-obamacare-this-is-very-much-a-womens-issue/comment-page-1/#comment-2730742"><strong>NET-NANNYING COMMENT THREADS ARE BORING TO READ . . .</strong></a></p>

<p>Even Mr. Morrissey knows that letting the racism of his compatriots trot out in response to <em>every and anything he writes</em> might give others the correct impression about what the actual issue is here. There’s a reason, after all, he had to write <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/18/a-note-about-our-comment-section/">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Odd that he shuffles the most significant thing he says into a parenthetical, don’t you think? But these people <em>are not</em>, I repeat, <em>not</em> racists. As proof, I present to you this video from the Values Voters Summit in which Tony Perkins, a supporter of the Council of Conservative Citizens, a group which once posted <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050204012636/cofcc.org/shelby.htm">this</a> [<em>not for the faint of heart or stomach</em>] on their official page, introduced Congressman Roy Blunt, who then went on to tell a joke about “eliminating the monkey problem” that <em>was not</em>, I repeat, <em>not</em> in any way a dog-whistle:</p>

Do <i>NOT</i> click it unless you&#39;re prepared for something both physically and psychically disgusting.</p>

<p>Second, I thought the comment thread after Morissey&#39;s cautionary post was <i>fascinating</i> for the vitriol directed at <i>Little Green Footballs</i> and its proprietor Charles Johnson. Apparently the racist stuff is <i>their</i> fault, though why LGF would want to, or even think to, sabotage Hot Air comment threads by making HA look bad <i>to liberals</i> is unclear to me. LGF trolls are apparently worse than leftist ones, though there were a few swats at purported liberal sock-puppet trollery (though, since they apparently consider LGF to be a leftist site now, it&#39;s not clear they weren&#39;t still talking about LGF).</p>

<p>Finally, though Morissey issued his caution, none of the comments you linked to have been removed at this point. </p></span>

<p>Nor will they be, because <em>those aren&#39;t the ones considered racist</em>.  The mind, it boggles.</p>

<p>As for the <em>LGF</em> thing, it has to do with an <em>LGF</em> poster going to <em>Hot Air</em> and saying a few racist things just to get the <em>HA</em> commenters to agree in mass numbers.  I&#39;m not exactly sure what&#39;s going on with <em>LGF</em> anymore, what with getting booted from <em>Powerline</em> and <em>Instapundit</em>&#39;s blogrolls for attacking them for being racist.  </p></span>

<p><em>You don&#39;t notice a difference between diagnosed as possibly having and actually having and being treated for meningitis? </em></p>

<p>I do . . . but you don&#39;t seem to realize that people are treated for their symptoms while they wait for the results of tests that take three days (which is what a spinal tap takes).  Given that they were both talking about the waiting and the terrible uncertainty, I believe your lack of charity falls into the category of actual dishonesty here.  As a friend said elsewhere:</p>

<blockquote>[T]he child was in the hospital for days with a high fever. One who has children always worries about permanent damage in the case of a serious illness, whether or not it’s been correctly diagnosed. I don’t know what the timeline is for a meningitis diagnosis, thanks be to god, but there are two possibilities: it’s positive, which is terrifying; it’s negative, which means you still don’t know what’s wrong with your seriously ill child, which is devastating.</blockquote>

<p>Turns out the timeline was, as the President said, &quot;three or four days.&quot;  So please, indulge in your surname and try again, as I think you&#39;ll have more luck that way.</p>

<p><em>the obvious implication is that Sasha did have meningitis.</em></p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t.  The implication is that his child <em>was very, very ill</em>.  The fact that that illness wasn&#39;t meningitis is beside the point, for the reason presented in my post.  </p>

<p><em> I mean whatever, anybody who heard Michelle&#39;s comments would come away with the impression that Sasha had meningitis and anyone who heard Barack&#39;s comments would come away with the impression that she didn&#39;t[.]</em></p>

<p>Seriously, if you can&#39;t keep your convenient half-truths straight, why should I even pretend to think that you&#39;re being intellectually honest?  I mean, I try, I really, really try . . . but you need to put in some effort.  Otherwise, I have to correct your nonsense, recapitulate the lie you wanted to sell, then refute it, and that&#39;s really not fair.</p></span>

Somewhere over the state of Washington he became very ill.  The first 4 days of our family vacation were spent in Childern&#39;s Hospital of Orange County.  He had a spinal tap which proved it was not memingitis, but it was a horrible experience for us.  These facts remain very clear in our minds stillsome 30 years later. At one point we thought he was dying as did the nurses caring for him.   The facts are remembered by both his father and his mother and no differences in the story have ever occurred.  When it is your child, you remember.  For the president to say something different shows yet another occasion to spin a story that is helpful to whatever cause he is speaking about.  Parents remember serious illness in their child the same way.  The moms are better at recall of the events, but the facts remain the same.  Someone is lying and using a child&#39;s illness to their own advantage.</p></span>

<blockquote>For example, in the summer of 2004 a doctor diagnosed with me and treated for a mild case of depression. A few months later, my throat swelled up and a different doctor diagnosed me with thyroid cancer. In both cases, I was diagnosed. If I say that I was diagnosed with mild depression in the summer of 2004, nothing that happened subsequently would make me a liar for stating it because that is the way logic and the English language work.</blockquote>

<p>Was I lying when I told you I was diagnosed with mild depression?  If the answer is &quot;no,&quot; then, there&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with what the President said.  </p></span>

<p>Wow. If this is true you are unlike every couple or set of parents I have ever known.</p>

<p><i>Someone is lying and using a child&#39;s illness to their own advantage.</i></p>

<p>Huh.  I think folks have already dealt with the question of &quot;lying&quot;.  Clearly the President and First Lady are using the story of their child&#39;s illness to make a point and I suppose they see advancing that point as in their own and perhaps the country as a whole&#39;s advantage.  The thing is that I don&#39;t see anything wrong with that.  If I were using the story of a child&#39;s illness to convince you to buy my mail order products and services that might seem a little tawdry. But I think that politicians are allowed to tell stories from their private lives, whether I agree with whatever conclusions they might draw from those stories or not.</p></span>

He used this sockpuppet to &#39;prove&#39; that hot air uses racial slurs.  Charles Johnson thought it was illuminating, despite this contradicting LGF&#39;s own disclaimers on threads.</p>

<p>LGF is a very racist blog that is now proven to peddle in racism, racial slurs, and the lowest sort of thing like that.  They ban people for any slight thing, but everyone who cares already knows all that already.</p>

<p>SEK is accusing someone of race baiting, and I don&#39;t really even care.  I mean, it&#39;s SEK.  no one cares. </p></span>

(This, however, does.)</strong> For purely academic reasons, I’ve never understood the argument that we should ignore Rush Limbaugh because he’s simply an entertainer who says outrageous things that millions of people are merely entertained by. I didn’t read the complete works of Silas Weir Mitchell because they were good—they are almost uniformly awful—I read them because they were popular. I was interested not in the content of his thought—it is almost uniformly mediocre—but in why his contemporaries found it so wildly appealing. If you want to learn which ideas and ideologies literate Americans in 1900 found comforting, you do not consult Henry James: you turn to the inartistic novels that parroted their prejudices back to them in a language they already understood. So when people say that we should dismiss Limbaugh on the grounds that he only says outrageous things to sell his product, I’m never quite sure why they’re more concerned with Limbaugh’s motivations than the fact that millions of Americans are buying what he’s selling. Ignoring whatever millions of Americans are buying distorts your understanding of the American political scene whether it be 2009 or 1909. If you work on popular culture in 1909, you are limited to tracking the flight of a given idea—but if you track a given idea in 2009, your work can actually change its trajectory. You might not know exactly where exactly that idea will land yet, but you can do the political calculus required to figure out where it came from and where it’s likely to strike. If it feels like you’re tilting window fans at cannon balls from half a continent away, remember what they say about rare Chinese butterflies flapping their wings: they are less likely to be minuten-pinned by mad lepidopterists—which is beside the point. The point, as one prominent Beatles apologist recently argued, is that cultural studies can be an important fan so long as we aim it at the right cannonball. In this case, the important issue is not that Limbaugh is a racist who makes racist statements, but that those statements resonate with his audience so powerfully. Consider, for example, that he feels no compulsion to qualify his sarcastic call for segregated busing: RUSH: Well, did he say why, in Obama’s America, that incident with the white kid getting beat up on the black school bus was not racially motivated? CALLER: I didn’t hear him comment about that. No, sir. RUSH: Because we’ve seen the videotape. Have you seen the videotape? CALLER: Sure. RUSH: We can’t hear what’s being said. CALLER: No. RUSH: So we don’t know what obvious taunts this lone white student was dishing out to the whole bus. CALLER: Right. RUSH: We don’t know what obvious taunts. CALLER: Right. RUSH: Worse than the obvious verbal taunts, we all know the racism that was in the kid’s mind. I mean Newsweek magazine says he was born a racist. So you know the white kid is sitting there thinking N-word and all kinds of things being surrounded by...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/conservatives-are-outraged-over-an-actual-outrage-color-me-impressed.html"><span><strong>Conservatives are outraged over an actual outrage? Color me impressed.</strong> It may have taken awhile, but thanks to Patrick Courrielche’s exposé at, of all places, Big Hollywood, conservatives are positively fuming over the Bush Administration‘s decision to funnel $2.2 billion through the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives into programs that specifically support the President’s ideological and policy commitments, like the Abstinence Education Program, designed to “enable states to provide abstinence education and mentoring, counseling, and adult supervision to promote abstinence from sexual activity.” Conservatives are rightly upset with a speech Bush delivered at the 2004 White House National Conference on Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, in which he said “[i]t’s hard to be a faith-based program if you can’t practice faith [and] the message to you is, we’re changing the culture here in America.” “It’s hard to read his comments as anything but a call for groups to engage in a partisan campaign on behalf of the Bush Administration’s policy agenda,” argued John Hinderaker. Nick Gillespie agreed, saying that “[i]f you’ve ever wondered—and worried—about where government support of the arts leads, look no further than the full transcript of an August 10, 2009 telecon[ference call] between an official at the National Endowment for the Arts and a group of ‘independent artists from around the country.’” Wait wait wait—I thought conservatives were upset because the White House created an office, installed it five federal agencies, then used them to fund a clearly partisan policy agenda to the tune of $2.2 billion. You mean to tell me all those links are about an August 10th conference call that tried to wrangle up support for the current President’s National Day of Service—a call in which not one cent of the NEA’s $155 million budget was dispensed or even offered? They are. All the outrage centers around a conference call designed, in the words soon-to-be-becked* Yosi Sergant, “to raise the visibility” for a program whose purpose is to encourage “all Americans and others throughout the world to voluntarily perform at least one good deed or another service activity on the anniversary of 9/11 each year, and on other days marked by terrorist events.” The problem, it seems, is that the NEA is supposed to be above partisanship, and supporting the President’s United We Serve initiative is seen by conservatives to be a partisan issue. Here are some of its highly partisan goals: We want to make Americans’ lives better by asking everybody to participate in shaping the life of their community and make the quality of life better. Clearly, “making Americans’ lives better” is a partisan issue. Which would be acceptable, were the administration not being so heavy-handed: [H]ow do we move the people who look to each of you for guidance to get involved? We have to leave that to you because nobody else knows how to do it better than you do[.] Clearly, dictating that individual organizations ought to do what they think is appropriate in a manner of their own choosing is but one step from installing Obama as...</span></a></div>
