<p>They are all men, yes,<em>&nbsp;</em>and American exceptionalists at that.&nbsp; I could list many more such men—including important ones like Charles Beard and F.O. Matthiessen—but the point I wish to make with this list is that dry, empty formalism was <em>not</em> the only available mode of literary scholarship in the years before and of New Critical dominance.&nbsp; Now let's move to some of the theoretical influences of the New Historicists:

</p>

<ul><li>&quot;Linguistics and Literary Theory,&quot; Leo Spitzer, trans. Michel Foucault</li>

<li>&quot;Philology and <em>Weltliteratur</em>,&quot; Erich Auerbach, trans. Marie and Edward Said</li>

<li>&quot;<a href="http://www.culturaleconomics.atfreeweb.com/Anno/Ryle%20Thinking%20of%20Thoughts%20USASK%201968.htm">The Thinking of Thoughts</a>,&quot; Gilbert Ryle</li>

<li>&quot;Thick Description: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture,&quot; Clifford Geertz</li>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0679752552"><em>Discipline and Punish</em></a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" /> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0679724699"><em>The History of Sexuality</em></a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" />, Michel Foucault</li></ul>

<p>Note the emphasis on <em>late </em>Foucault.&nbsp; New Historicists think less about the repressiveness of power and more about the organization and channeling of it.&nbsp; Note, however, the conspicuous absence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annales_School">the <em>Annales </em>school</a>.&nbsp; As constructed from these particular sources, New Historicism embraced a radical perspective on the events and narratives they purported to explain.&nbsp; Despite the attempt to distance themselves from the &quot;stuffy&quot; historians of the first half of the century, in the end they had far more in common with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_A._Beard">Progressive</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_L._Parrington">School</a> of historiography than they're wont to admit.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The historicism I espouse fails all sorts of political tests.&nbsp; It does not attempt to the advance the cause of the working class.&nbsp; It bombs every test of direct social effect one could throw at it.&nbsp; It is more interested in an account of what happened and why and how than in tracking the flow of power at a particular moment in order to liberate contemporary readers from said moment's social or political bequest.&nbsp; But if one is to be an historicist today one must be familiar with that form of historicism and should therefore read:</p>

<p>Seminal, that is.&nbsp; It addresses most of the aforementioned works . . . only in a way that makes one wonder whether there isn't some unstated principle of selection at work.&nbsp; The collection's triumphalist tone remains clarion-loud throughtout with one exception.&nbsp; I implore you to read the entirety of the book from which that exception is excerpted:</p>

<p>Yes, Thomas is on my dissertation committee . . . but it's not as if I'm responsible for the inclusion of his confrontational essay in an anthology published <em>when I was in the 6th grade.</em>&nbsp; Once the necessary theoretical legwork has been tackled, I recommend reading a couple of truly phenomenal works of what could be called the &quot;<em>New </em>New Historicism&quot; or &quot;<em>Post-</em>New Historicism&quot; or somesuch.&nbsp; Because literary historicism today is many things to many scholars but lacks the movementy feeling of other literary revolutions.&nbsp; A couple of obviously biased suggestions:</p>

<p>I am in the midst of a discussion in another place about historicism, starting with Hegel, taking a major stop at Marx, and then moving on to Fukuyama.  Now I think I understand that the New New Historicism is largely about literature, but I don&#39;t really have a solid grasp on that part.</p>

<p>Or much else, either.</p>

<p>So, is the New New Historicism about literature, or philosophy?</p>

<p>Keep it simple, Scott.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m that bright (anymore).</p>

		<span id="comment-15689087-content"><p>Jon, reading the run of <i>Representations</i> would ably introduce one to New Historicism, but it wouldn&#39;t say much about the state of historicism today.  For example, even Greenblatt&#39;s <i>Will in the World</i>--granted, intended for popular consumtion--disavows many of the interpretive moves which informed, say, <i>Renaissance Self-Fashioning</i>.  Also, reading the Vesser gives one a healthy dose of those early <i>Representation</i> articles.  Now, I should add that I&#39;m not tossing <i>Annales</i> aside here; in fact, were this to be a more idiosyncratic list, <i>i.e.</i> what thought informs Scott&#39;s particular idea of historicism, the <i>Annales</i> school would be front-and-center, since methodologically I situate myself somewhere in the tension between Foucauldian discourse and <i>la longue durée</i>.  But I wanted this to be a more general list.</p>

<p>Someone <i>should</i> do a list for analytic philosophy.  Someone should also add analytic philosophy and some of its major subsects to the list he posted yesterday, and will.</p>

<p>Jake, yes, I limited this to literary studies because, well, because I&#39;m neither a philosopher nor an historian.  However, the absence of German <i>Historismus/Geschichtswissenschaft</i> from the American historicist tradition is the subject of the second chapter of Brook Thomas&#39; <i>New Historicism and Other Old-Fashioned Topics</i>; and a few of the essays in the Vesser anthology specifically tackle the relation of literary historicism to Marxism.  The point being, then, that both must be brought to bear on the American historicist tradition from the outside because they don&#39;t constitute its foundation.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t consider philology coterminus with historicism, Jonathan.  I agree with the general sentiments you&#39;ve expressed--in that they&#39;re the reason for I included that first group, dispelling the idea of New Critical hegemony in literary studies--but I don&#39;t think you can draw a direct line from philology to historicism, if only because the historicism of, say, the &#39;10s and &#39;20s set itself up as opposed to the philological approaches.  Someone like Van Wyck Brooks or Matthiessen or Parrington can&#39;t be seen as philological in any sense of the word; they can, however, be considered historicists and/or early American Studies (which is exactly what Leo Marx&#39;ll call &#39;em in the &#39;50s).  The best place for a brief history of all this (for those interested) would be Graff&#39;s <i>Professing Literature</i>.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-15696388-content"><p>Not to be deflationary... but isn&#39;t &#39;historicism&#39; really just anything that doesn&#39;t take natural right as a point of departure?  The point being, of course, that the term doesn&#39;t do anything except rhetorically.  (c.f., Leo and the Straussians.)  That is to say, Nietzsche and Hegel are equally &quot;historicist&quot;.</p>

<p>(To continue rattling on about Foucault -- the works of the mid-seventies aren&#39;t &#39;late&#39;.  &#39;Late&#39; Foucault refers to the ethical period.  The so-called &#39;final Foucault&#39;, whose &#39;finality&#39; is easily disputed given that he died thus imposing the idea of &#39;finality&#39; upon what he was doing at the time.  The works of the mid-seventies are usually periodized as &#39;genealogical&#39; in opposition to the earlier &#39;archaeological&#39; works.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-15696685-content"><p>Craig, I&#39;m not understanding where you&#39;re coming from in that first sentence.  I think we may be operating with an entirely different set of presuppositions which ought to be hashed out before we continue.  Case in point: &quot;late Foucault.&quot;  Here&#39;s an excerpt from a June 2005 article in Foucault Studies which conforms to my post-<i>D &amp; P</i> thinking on the matter:</p>

<blockquote>The “late Foucault” is probably one of the most widely discussed topics in research published on Foucault. A popular view on this <i>late period</i> holds that at some point in his oeuvre, Foucault turned away from analysing the power/knowledge mechanisms that fabricate subjects, and turned to analysing how subjects constitute themselves. (emphasis mine)</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s from Harrar&#39;s &quot;The Theme of Subjectivity in Foucault&#39;s Lecture Series <i>L&#39;herméneutique du sujet</i>.&quot;  Admittedly, I grabbed that off of Google, but it does accord with my definition and it is in Foucault Studies, so I can&#39;t be the only one who thinks this.  I mean, yes, I understand the genealogical/archeological distinction, &amp;c.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-15697235-content"><p>Scott: referring to D&amp;P and HSI, you wrote, &quot;Note the emphasis on <i>late</i> Foucault.&quot;  These aren&#39;t &#39;late&#39; works -- they are the &#39;middle&#39; or &#39;genealogical&#39; works.  Take the following as examples, from the copy on Taylor &amp; Vintages, <i>Feminism and the Final Foucault</i>:</p>

<p>&quot;This collection is a useful and insightful connection between Foucault&#39;s later work on the self and feminist focus on the political nature of the personal.  It is sure to be of great interest both to feminists and Foucault scholars.&quot; - Jon Simons</p>

<p>&quot;Michel Foucault&#39;s influence on feminist theory and practice is probably as great as that of any intellectual figure of the twentieth century.  But to this point feminists have drawn mainly from his &#39;middle works&#39; such as <i>Discipline and Punish</i> and the first volume of <i>The History of Sexuality</i>.  Like many others, feminist thinkers have not been as readily able to recognize the theoretical and political significance of Foucault&#39;s later works.  [...]&quot;  - Melissa Orlie</p>

<p>Standard periodization is as follows:</p>

<p>(1) &#39;Early&#39; - <i>History of Madness</i><br />
(2) &#39;Archaeological&#39; - <i>Order of Things</i>, <i>Archaeology of Knowledge</i><br />
(3) &#39;Genealogical&#39; - <i>Discipline and Punish</i> and HSI<br />
(4) &#39;Late&#39;/&#39;Final&#39;/&#39;Ethical&#39; - HSII, HSIII</p>

<p>&quot;Hermenutics of the Self&quot; is a late work.  The passage you cite in reference to &quot;Hermeneutics&quot; refers to &quot;power/knowledge&quot; (i.e., the genealogical) as not being &quot;late&quot;.  The author is clearly referring to works of the eighties, such as the &quot;Hermeneutics&quot; lectures, as &quot;late&quot;.</p>

<p>Trust me on this: D&amp;P and HSI are most certainly <i>not</i> &#39;late&#39; works.</p>

<p>(It feels strange to argue in this way about Foucault -- the guy who wrote &quot;What is an Author?&quot;.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-15698103-content"><p>You see, I did think it was a disciplinary thing: you see, as far as literary scholars are concerned, the breakdown is between 2 and 3 . . . and it maps onto the names &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late.&quot;  In fact, to answer your earlier question about where literary historicists find interest in Foucault, it&#39;s largely in categories 2 and 3; I know queer theorists take more from the &quot;late&quot; Foucault, but in discussions of his influence on the field it&#39;s typical to map &quot;early&quot; onto <i>Order of Things</i> and <i>Archeology of Knowledge</i> and &quot;late&quot; onto <i>D &amp; P</i> and <i>History of Sexuality I</i>.  At least, that&#39;s as fine a distinction as I regularly see drawn.</p>

<p>Or maybe this isn&#39;t a disciplinary blindspot, but my own.  In which case, I need to pester some people who <i>should</i> know better and <i>should</i> have corrected me <i>hundreds</i> of times over the past five or six years.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-15699263-content"><p>The periodization I employ is the standard one among &quot;Foucault scholars&quot; (whatever that means), myself included.  One can certainly understand the distinction vis a vis literary studies -- the more overt concern with representation and discourse versus the concern with change and power.  This division, however, really does ignore a significant body of Foucault&#39;s work (not to suggest that anyone should make use of all of it), both at the beginning and the end.  </p>

<p>In a sense, the problem of periodization and naming largely derives from Foucault.  Or, perhaps I should say the Anglo-American reception of Foucault, which has been, on the whole, of a pretty low quality and standard.  I say this as someone who takes Foucault seriously and who thinks that others should too.  (Foucault is to me as Derrida is to Matt?)</p>

<p>It seems worth enquiring why people would entirely write off the ethical works -- close to a decade of work -- in what would have been, AIDS notwithstanding, one of his most productive decades...  (Having said that, I find little use for myself of his late works -- OT and HSI are clearly the most important for me.)</p></span>

[Please see this post for the updated version of the list.] It all started when I was an undergraduate. One morning I woke up and decided to read a general history of every single American state. I made it through four or five before tiring of the genre. At the time I wish I had a list of the best history of each state. I asked a history professor of mine if such a list existed and was informed that not only did no list exist, but that the labor required to create one would boggled his imagination. Needless to say, all of this happened when the WWW was in its infancy and blogs but a twinkle in its eye. I thought perhaps I could cull a decent one from Wikipedia entries, but a cursory examination of topics upon which I have some expertise revealed that those references are of dubious quality. Then I thought: I can start a movement. So I sent Ralph an email about the state history project. (About ten minutes ago. Some nerve he has, not replying yet.) But I can start a little something here. My choice of both category and best book concerning it is intended as a way to begin the discussion. I can only work with what I've read. (Some areas I've read around in but can't think of a qualifier for &quot;best introduction.&quot;) This project has the possibility to demonstrate the real strength of the distributive intelligence review process. Please suggest additional categories and alternative selections, as my list is no way authoritative or exhaustive. I also want to avoid &quot;representative&quot; works, i.e. the best introduction to psychoanalysis being The Interpretation of Dreams. I want books which cover a wider swath than a single work by a representative figure can. Note: All categories and/or periods contain all the problems inherent to categorization and periodization. I also imagine that there must be a better way to organize this list, as this somewhat chronological organization seems unwieldy. I expect many edits to both the body of this post and the substance of the list.
