			<p>Per Serritslev Peterson’s “Jack London’s Medusa of Truth” (<em>Philosophy and Literature</em>
26.1) challenges our ideas about the notoriously eclectic and
idiosyncratic philosophical thought of Jack London, a.k.a. “The Boy
Socialist,” a.k.a. “The Adolescent Nietzschean,” a.k.a. “The College
Spencerian,” a.k.a. “The Middle-Aged Nietzschean Socialist,” a.k.a.
“The Forty Year-Old Jungian.” Despite bouncing from one
hermetically-sealed-but-internally-coherent philosophical system to
another for the majority of his short life, Peterson insists that
London’s critics misconstrue the nature of his philosophical questing. 
So he gathers London’s little truthlets and declares
</p>
<blockquote><p>London as philosopher 1) was a Nietzschean dialectician who
mastered and negotiated the juxtaposition of conflicting ideas,
perspectives, and values in life (the Medusa-Maya dichotomy being a
crucial case in point); and who consequently, 2) possessed
philosophical authenticity and integrity, or what Nietzsche terms
“intellectual conscience.&quot;</p></blockquote>


<p>I generally applaud counter-intuitive readings.&nbsp; When Peterson
identifies his as being such a beast, stating that his “contentions
must appear highly questionable in contemporary American academe,” he
implicates his article in the storied tradition which, as just noted, I
generally applaud.&nbsp; However, the second clause of that sentence baffles
me: “seeing that very few London scholars or critics take the
novelist’s philosophy seriously.” Most London scholars not only take
one of his philosophical positions seriously, they construct elaborate
channels through which they can safely navigate three or four of them. 
Peterson’s argument is counter-intuitive in an artificial and synthetic
fashion...and in this sense resembles those London himself favored.&nbsp; In
short, then, Peterson’s consistency fetish neatly doubles London’s own;
furthermore, it blinds him to the inconsistencies of his work much as
London’s blinded him to the inconsistencies in his.&nbsp; That said,
Peterson’s performance easily outshines London’s clunky stabs at
synthesis; it is, to be frank, a bravura performance on Peterson’s
part.&nbsp; <em>But I still don’t buy a word of it.</em>
</p>
<p>
Then there’s the case of James Berger, a man I treated unfairly in <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/scholarly_swing.html">a brief post</a>
about what I (mistakenly) believed to be an (unintentionally)
infelicitous pair of sentences.&nbsp; In “Falling Towers and Postmodern Wild
Children: Oliver Sacks, Don DeLillo and Turns Against Language” (<em>PMLA</em>
120.2), Berger discusses the work of Oliver Sacks as a singular body of
thought, consistent throughout, be he writing for a popular audience in
<em>The New York Review of Books</em> or the scientific community in <em>Neurology</em>. 
(Now, I admit that Sacks is not the best example, since as I’ve skimmed
some of his scientific writing he seems more consistent than someone
like Steven Pinker.&nbsp; But bear with me, since I’m not here to bury
Berger, but praise him.) For Berger, Sacks’ theory of a pre-linguistic
subjectivity--accessible through interaction with highly acculturated
aesthetic objects like symphonies and modernist poetry--exists in equal
measure in his popular and scientific thought.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
I would argue that a savvy rhetorician like Sacks would recognize the
ideological investments of his audience and pitch his presentations to
them: hence his references to patients cured by Beethoven, pains
ameliorated by Mahler and people reborn through Brahms.&nbsp; I doubt those
staples of NPR appear as frequently in his scientific papers like, say,
“Cycad Neurotoxins, Consumption of Flying Foxes, and ALS-PDC Disease in
Guam.” Those references say as much about the audience a popular
science writer like Sacks keys his performance to please as it does
about his own thought on the matter.&nbsp; (Or not.&nbsp; This is why Sacks is a
bad example of this general phenomenon.) Here’s the thing: Berger’s
argument would be strenghtened were he to turn from what <em>Sacks</em> believes to what Sacks’ <em>audience</em>
believes.&nbsp; He need not worry about Sacks, or whether Sacks’ scientific
work jives with his popular, because the rhetoric of his popular
work--in which he appeals to an idea of a pre-linguistic subjectivity
accessible through highly acculturated aesthetic objects--proves
Berger’s point more powerfully by dint of its popularity.&nbsp; He need not
focus on Sacks’ personal beliefs to deliver his argument convincingly.</p>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/concerning_psyc.html"><span><strong>Concerning Psychoanalytic &quot;Truths,&quot; the IWW &amp; Gangesa's Tattvacintamani</strong> [Note: an update for interested parties.] The area below contains some very typical sophistry which, for reasons I can't entirely explain outside of a general sense of annoyance, I took some time I don't have to respond to. You can see the original (as well as other objects worthy of hearty ridicule) by putting your eye to glass and peering deep into the heart of faux-liberatory dogmatism. I should add: although this thinker belongs to the Long Sunday collective, he belongs there as much as Eugene Debs would have &quot;belonged&quot; on the current Cabinet (if you reversed the political valences such that Debs were neoconservative and the Bush Cabinet composed of Wobblies). I may've squeezed more volatile political history into that sentence than the rest of everything I've ever written in my entire life combined. So proceed, if you dare, and place your eye firmly 'gainst the glass: I typically refrain from reposting comments I post elsewhere, but since I suspect it's not long for his blog, I want to memorialize my response to [PR]'s breathtakingly blinkered post about those who don't worship the ground the feet with which Lacan did his thinking walked on.[1] It reads (minus some embarrassing praise for the genuinely praiseworthy folks at Long Sunday): I've been thinking about the charge so often launched by Anglo-American academics at French theorists, that they are &quot;charlatans&quot;. Sometimes, they're right. Baudrillard, surely, does often over-reach with his theoretical adventures, thereby showing up his actual lack of `knowledge' in the field under consideration/theorization. But this is also part of what makes him so great, and such a great thinker to think with. (Lacan, on the other hand, I could never accept the term 'charlatan', since his is an almost perfect system. Now, he might not have the best philosophical knowledge, but he doesn't cite it anyhow in the same way as Baudrillard.) But it's a sort of mirror-image (or Moebius strip), this charge against the French, for, from another angle, it is the Anglo-Americans who are the charlatans. They refuse to theorise, and call themselves instead 'Post-theorists' (i.e. in contemporary film studies), whose only defining commonality is a negative one: resistance to (Lacanian) psychoanalysis. The great irony is that the psychoanalysis they are rejecting is Anglo-American bungled appropriations/bastardizations of Lacan, not Lacan's work itself. After all, most of the early writings on the Gaze and whatever based themselves on a single essay of Lacan's (that, in fact, never mentioned the Gaze!). To refuse the theorise, but to instead surround oneself with the shiny trinkets of knowledge (discourse of the University) ... this is the true charlatanism. When one doesn't argue a position, as Anglo-Americans don't, then one is only ever protecting oneself, perhaps for the hope of tenure. But without exposing oneself to critique one is just filling up space, and heck, I'll even follow the conservative line here, wasting taxpayer's money. Now that's charlatanism. Refusing to defer to psychoanalytic sophistries is charlatanism? So if you're still with me after...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/confessions_of_.html"><span><strong>Confessions of a Very Tired Slob: Saturday, 1 October 2005</strong> You know those days when you wake up with a blistering headache and the conviction that your &quot;sleep&quot; had been poisoned by bland Thai food? When you wake up, put on a pair of clean pajamas and spend the afternoon half-reading, half-focusing and -unfocusing your eyes? When you encounter a sink brimming over with soiled dishes and decide to drink Australian wine from a measuring cup? (&quot;Check out these legs! Almost eighteen ounces high!&quot;) Such has been my day. Clutching my measuring cup of cheap Australian wine, I debate the merits of a brie-on-stale-crackers dinner. I momentarily avoid eating a dinner so unnutritive by thinking about the able demolition of Jonathan Franzen (written by Ben Marcus) in this month's Harper's. I attempt to write something intelligent about it but am too distracted by the picture of trashiness I currently strike. The irrational fear that Dell's installed a webcam somewhere on this monster overwhelms. Ashamed, I hide from the computer for the rest of the evening. Update: For those of you who wrote to express concern over my dinner selection, have no fear. Instead of eating cheese on stale cracked-pepper water-crackers, I generously spread my brie over stale whole-wheat matzah. It may not be that much more nutritious, but at least the Lord I don't believe in sanctions it.</span></a></div>
