		<span id="comment-12654469-content"><p>You&#39;ve been remiss in your duties, Acolyte.  (Or are you only John&#39;s?)  I&#39;ve explained where the name came from <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/08/on_names_or_how.html" rel="nofollow">before</a>, but I&#39;m not above and/or below self-citations:</p>

<blockquote>There are levels to my self-deprecation.  The first marches alongside Acephalous up there at the top of the page, informing potential readers of the possibility that I&#39;m one of the &quot;Acephalous people&quot; some &quot;modern travellers still pretend to find in America.&quot;  That quotation from Emphraim Chambers&#39; Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences should have satisfied even the most ardent self-deprecators.  But I wanted more.  So I installed a double-super-secret self-deprecatory mechanism deep in the bowels of my dissertation.  On page 38 the bold can discover the following account of how Herbert Spencer nuanced Jean-Baptiste Lamarck&#39;s account of cephalopod evolution:

<blockquote><i>Adaptation allows the animal to survive long enough for the force of progress to work on it, and adaptation depends on what Lamarck called sentiment intérieur, the ability to adapt, reflexively if not consciously, to environmental vagaries. In a revision of his last major work, The Principles of Ethics (1897), Spencer nuanced Lamarck’s statements on the subkingdom Mollusca. Lamarck, it will be remembered, considers the entire subkingdom to belong to the animaux sensibles or “sensitive animals.”

<p>[snip]</p>

<p>[Spencer] divides Mollusca into the “cephalopods,” the higher mollusks, and what Lamarck had called “acephala,” the “head-less” or lower mollusks. I have chosen to focus on the subkingdom Mollusca because the division between its orders is so stark: some have heads and are non-adaptive, others have heads and are adaptive. To be a headless mollusk is to remain beholden to the whims of the force of progress. For Lamarck, Chambers, and Spencer, the headless mollusks will acquire heads at a moment preordained by force of progress. To be a headed mollusk, on the other hand, is to possess the ability to form habits, and as I discussed above, the formation of habits is the first link in the causal chain of Lamarckian evolution—altered environment to changed habits to modified forms. But the headed-headless distinction indicates why his adamant belief in a progressive, evolutionary, and absolute force would be tempered by the adaptive prong of Lamarckian evolution: heads mattered. So did what was in them.</i></blockquote></p>

<p>So you see, dear reader, I am 1) without head and 2) dependent on a non-existant force of progress if I&#39;m ever to improve my station.  Since I place no more faith in non-existent progressive forces than the non-existent divinities compelling them, I&#39;m doubly doomed to this acephalic life.  Luckily I&#39;ve come to like it.</blockquote></p></span>

<p>Like Rich, when I first came upon your blog I thought of &quot;Acéphale&quot; (I had a young fascination with Surrealism). I wasn&#39;t familiar with &quot;Acephalous&quot; and had to look it up to see if the two words were of the same root.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-12655668-content"><p>I don&#39;t think using two or even three of our names will kill us.  I had at least twenty people approach me cold at the MLA and say &quot;You&#39;re Scott Eric Kaufman! I read your stuff!&quot; or &quot;You&#39;re the guy who caught the students having sex in his office!&quot; or, like Bérubé, &quot;You&#39;re Scott, nice to meet you.  Janet, this is the guy who caught the students having sex in his office!&quot;  I kid, I kid.  (Sort of.)  The percentage of people who asked me about my work based on what they&#39;d read about it hear and on the Valve was surprisingly high.  Outside of that, I have the following anecdote:</p>

<p>One UCI professor told another that he thought he saw me eating dinner with the editors of <i>The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism</i> and was about to say hello, but then thought better of himself, because there&#39;s no way that could&#39;ve been me.  (It was.  And it wasn&#39;t all the editors, just two, I believe.  But you see my point.)  </p>

<p>In short, the connections I&#39;ve made blogging are 1) substantial on their face and 2) outweigh whatever negative effect my blog may have on my marketability.  Think of it like this: I have an obscene number of people who want to read my chapters as I finish them (which I will do one of these days, I promise).  All those eyes, all the suggestions they can provide, the reading they can point me to, the arguments they can help me refine, &amp;c. add up to what will be a stronger dissertation, which means I&#39;ll have a stronger writing sample, which means I&#39;ll have a better shot at making my interviews count.  So I don&#39;t think you need to think of blogging under your name as career suicide, Tribble be damned.</p></span>

<p>Alas, nothing as, erm, sexy as Professor Office Sex leads one to my blog, as far as I know.</p>

<p>And Scott, I think because your blog is so damn smart and usually about headier (hehe) stuff than students having sex in your office, that it&#39;s always going to bring you more good notice than bad (if ever the latter).  My *god* that was an ugly sentence...but you get my drift.</p>

<p>And apropos to a comment I made over at GZombie&#39;s, to which you responded, I&#39;ll try to screw up my nerve to jump into the conversation one of these days at the Valve.</p></span>

I'm loath to ruin to legend. But I will. (Skip to the bottom for the fun stuff.) Wai Chee Dimock led off. She complimented the &quot;speed and ferocity&quot; of Walter's arguments before veering into a polite and mannered 18 minute long screed against him and &quot;the theory of the tyranny of the regime of meaning.&quot; What did she mean? Invoking Lindsay Waters' now infamous critique of Walter in The Chronicle, Dimock claimed Our America acquires its &quot;speed and ferocity&quot; by inferring its way through a &quot;cultural logic.&quot; &quot;What makes this power powerful,&quot; she argued, is how it allows Walter to condense &quot;A to B to C&quot; into &quot;A therefore C.&quot; The propositional form of his arguments elevates logic to the status of evidence and evidence to the status of horse manure. Paul Gilroy provides a more sound model of literary scholarship in Against Race . Like Walter, Gilroy believes progressive anti-racism little more than &quot;quick ethnic fixes and pseudo-solidarities [which] foreclose argument.&quot; But unlike Walter, Gilroy turns to empirical evidence instead of propositional logic. This is better. Because it is. Walter's work is not to be emulated, she suggests, but supplemented along Gilroyian lines. That in the decade since its publication no one has emulated his work suggests Dimock possesses the ability to peer into the past and tell us things about it. Or that she wants to stop anyone from doing now what no one felt inclined to do then. (I'm proposing a panel for MLA 2006 in which the participants will beg the audience to stop composing scholarly monographs in drunken accord with the logic of cracked yarrow stalks. Consider that puppy nipped in its cute little bud.) Enter Sean McCann. Sean opened with a reception history of Our America which puts to bed Dimock's inspired concerns: To review the critical reception of Our America is to discover a remarkable record of consensus. Everyone agrees that the book offers a brilliant, revisionary account of the major American writing of the twenties and of the importance to it of the racial history of American citizenship. Everyone agrees that Michaels makes his case with a rare level of cogency, and that, where his most central claims are concerned, their logic cannot be faulted. Nearly everyone agrees as well that—for just these reasons—the book and its author should be reviled. (&quot;Wow, Scott, I'm impressed. You take the most amazing notes. It's like Sean emailed you his presentation and you pasted bits of it here. Does he ever get around to directly refuting Dimock's 'inspired' concern about Walter's influence?&quot;) He certainly does, dear reader, he certainly does: It's not unusual to find younger Americanists accept and build on any number of the book's specific claims, or to see Michaels’s insights taken up by scholars in other fields or even disciplines—like history, political science, and sociology, where Our America seems also to have been a...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/01/so_matt_takes_m.html"><span><strong>Do We Matter? or, Do We Even Want To?</strong> So Matt takes me to task for championing cultural studies by proxy . . . how should I respond? Should I say that, in the tradition of Brian Eno , I too took a plastic bladder to Le Centre Pompidou and urinated in Duchamp's magnum opus? Because I didn't. I've never even been to France. I've been through France. But I've never stayed there. (Which is sad, since after English and Italian and Latin, it's the only other language I know. Sure, I can read German, but reading knowledge counts for dirt.) But this post isn't about the French. (Nor is it about the brilliant terrorists who kidnapped a French man and said they wouldn't release him until France recalled all the troops they haven't deployed to the country they haven't deployed them to. Can you imagine the horror that hostage felt? Not only was he held hostage . . . he had to stomach the fact that his terrorists like to hump doorknobs.) I'm digressing. Like compulsively like. All I want to say is that the idealist in me still believes that examining popular culture pays cognitive (and potentially political) dividends. Teaching students how to &quot;read&quot; the shows and films and music they fetishize should be among a teacher's first priorities. When anti-intellectual critics complain about university professors teaching courses on contemporary rap I can't help but think &quot;Isn't that the role of the intellectual? Shouldn't we concentrate on the materials our students confront daily?&quot; Instead we insist on introducing them to unfamiliar material about which they cogitate for our courses but don't think about daily. Yes Yes Yes this is the old debate about whether we should uplift our students' understanding or teach them to think more good about the shit they think about anyway. (Yes Yes Yes intentional and for effect.) Since this question is more often avoided than answered I thought I'd re-re-re-re-repose it here. What should we be doing? Teaching them to &quot;read&quot; Titanic intelligently or teaching them to appreciate Joyce? (Because these options are mutually exclusive, see. They can't coexist, see. It's one or the other, see.)</span></a></div>
