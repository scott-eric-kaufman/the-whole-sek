        <meta name="description" content="Like everyone else, I always cruise Amazon's reviews of whatever it is I'm watching/reading/listening to so that I might better know how to appraise whatever it is I'm watching/reading/listening to. The most intelligent reviewers of any thing I watch/read/listen to are always the ones who spend what little free time they have attacking the movies/shows/books/albums they despise. For reasons I don't entirely understand, I believe that there's so much media (in McLuhan's all-encompassing sense of the term) out there it makes no sense to spend one's time hectoring what one dislikes and more time consuming what one likes. Notable exceptions abound, of course, but these are almost exclusively media with agenda, e.g. Left Behind, The Complete Works of Kirk Cameron, etc. (A right-thinking Christian will counter that Will and Grace has a homosexual agenda, and from their perspective it may look that way, but the producers of Will and Grace never, I imagine, sat down and decided to push their homosexual agenda on the American people. They work for NBC. They're capitalists first. So, this right-minded Christian would counter, are the authors/illustrators/producers/Kirk Camerons responsible for Left Behind. True. But whatever else the producers of Will and Grace are, they're not the vanguard of the homosexualization of Christian America in the same way that the folks behind Left Behind are the vanguard of the Christian Right. Don't believe me? Ask Joan Didion.) But I digress. I complain about those who complain not because they complain, no, but because they complain so poorly. They leave in the mouths of complainants a taste that encourages them not to complain in the future. Examples? Reading reviews of Deadwood, a show I've learned to love during my convalescence, Timothy VM &quot;TVM&quot; informs me that [t]he dialogue was ridiculous. I have no problems with the use of &quot;bad&quot; language in movies, but this was extremely juvenile! I would guess that at least half the sentences include the F word at least once. It was so gratuitous, e.g., &quot;I ain't f*cking goin' down stairs!&quot; The story line was very week. D. White Billy, a.k.a. rinkleroot, desires nothing more in life than a Freud SD508 Super Dado Set with Anti-Kickback Design. (Myself, I'm partial to Freud with a little kickback, but to each his own.) D. White Billy wants me to know how puerile and stupid am I for liking a show that really insults a persons intelligence, how difficult is it to write nothing but cussing over and over. Obviously the show is out to attract a very immature audience that thinks cursing is cool. Stay far away from TRASHWOOD!! Actually, the cocksucker's right about one thing: cussin' is fuckin' cool.

I will begin each sentence with a personal pronoun. I will follow some personal pronouns with a stative verb. (I think these stative verbs will help you to learn what I'm thinking and how I feel about whatever it is.) I will follow others with auxillary verbs indicating when I thought or believed such-and-such about my welfare. I will, in short, tell you all about how I had pneumonia but no longer do; how I had an invasive fungal infection in my liver but no longer do; and how I had a thyroid tumor but no longer do. I will tell you these things because I will pretend with much determination--evidenced as always by occasional strains and gruntings, as if I were lifting a fridge from the leg of a boy with cancer of testicles that have yet to descend--that's right, I will pretend with an ignorance born of effort and purpose that I don't know that you don't care about the minutae of my daily life. Because why would you, dear reader, unless you belong to the small passel of acephalites to which I too belong.... ...but belong only because I could not lead. Leadership being the one quality groups so defined can never hope to acquire. So, in closing, my febrile mind has been beaten back and I'm almost myself again. I plan on blogging the fuck out of this blog as soon as I concoct for my students a suitably absurd story about where I've been for the past week and why I've been there.</span></a></div>

I will read through the ramblings of my febrile mind--Ever wonder what the name of the indie band I'll never form will be? Now you don't have to--and correct its atrocious spelling. After all, if my words are all that represent me and they do so poorly... P.S. The grammar will be combed too. My prose went Alfalfa on me, but have no fears, I have a tongue, a comb, and no sense of shame...</span></a></div>
