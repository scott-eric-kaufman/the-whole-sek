In my reading, Keats stages Joshua Reynolds' argument in Seven Discourses on Art: [P]erfect form is produced by leaving out particularities, and retaining only general ideas ... the usual and most dangerous error is on the side of minuteness, and, therefore, I think caution most necessary where most have failed. The general idea constitutes real excellence. All smaller things, however perfect in their way, are to be sacrificed without mercy to the greater.

Not only would Keats have been familiar with Reynolds through the Annals, he would've expected its audience to be. So I've established that the poem's famous parting shot alerts the reader to Reynolds' influence. What of it? Someone like Keats—a keen student of Greek sculpture and pottery—would have known, or been able to guess, the answers to the questions he asks at the close of the first stanza. Had he been asked &quot;What men or gods are these?&quot; (8), he may have responded with any number of contemporaneous theories about the scene depicted on the Portland Vase (pictured right): Consider the treatment the young man advancing from the left, his right hand holding his cloak. Is he clutching it? Is it dangling? All evidence points to the former. The right hand lifting the cloak off the bare stone indicates that the figure had previously been seated beneath the Doric entablature. As anyone who spends countless hours studying Lucian amphorae knows, such positioning—beneath a column, his cloak a prophylactic against the cold, smooth stone—announces the presence of a god or immortal hero. If it be a hero, the cloak upon which he sits represents the mortality he doffed...

<p>So I've established that the poem's famous parting shot alerts the reader to Reynolds' influence.&nbsp; What of it?&nbsp; Someone like Keats—a keen student of Greek sculpture and pottery—would have known, or been able to guess, the answers to the questions he asks at the close of the first stanza.&nbsp; Had he been asked &quot;What men or gods are these?&quot; (8), he may have responded with any number of contemporaneous theories about the scene depicted on the Portland Vase (pictured right):</p><blockquote><p>Consider the treatment the young man advancing from the left, his right hand holding his cloak.&nbsp; Is he clutching it?&nbsp; Is it dangling?&nbsp; All evidence points to the former.&nbsp; The right hand lifting the cloak off the bare stone indicates that the figure had previously been <em>seated</em> beneath the Doric entablature.&nbsp; As anyone who spends countless hours studying Lucian amphorae knows, such positioning—beneath a column, his cloak a prophylactic against the cold, smooth stone—announces the presence of a god or immortal hero.&nbsp; If it be a hero, the cloak upon which he sits represents the mortality he doffed...</p></blockquote><p>Keats <em>could </em>have thought and written as much, but had he, the poem would not have achieved its general (philosophically speaking) effect.&nbsp; <em> </em>Keats' coy ignorance convinces readers that answering the questions in lines 5-10 would divest the urn of the very uncertainties responsible for its beauty.&nbsp; The poem feigns <a href="http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~clark9/ekphrasis/definition.htm">ekphrasis</a> the same way Reynolds enjoins his pupils to feign representation: by sacrificing, without mercy, the smaller things to the greater.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Given his druthers, Reynolds would have his students eschew a laundry list of &quot;smaller things&quot; for &quot;the whole beauty and grandeur of the art consists ... in being able to get above all singular forms, local customs, particularities, and details of every kind.&quot;&nbsp; Keats eschews this brilliantly, championing a mode of productive ignorance in which what matters is not <em>what</em> happened but <em>how</em> one represents it.&nbsp; Shrouded in sublime mists of unknowable unknowingness, history becomes exemplary or extinct.&nbsp; Such, at least, is the lesson lisping minions learn:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345350499/diesekoschmar-20">The Mists of Avalon</a> </em>is tremendously superior!&nbsp; <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441627404/diesekoschmar-20">Once and Future King</a> </em>sucks!&quot;</p>

		<span id="comment-26055929-content"><p>I always thought &quot;what men or gods are these&quot; was a rhetorical question.  It matters not a bit if they be men or gods, given the very ambiguity between mortals and gods in pre-Hellenic culture.  I assumed that Keats was drawing his readers&#39; attentions to that very ambiguity, one lost to the modern age and one the Romantics sought to reclaim: the divinity of the individual human imagination (as an adaptation of the Greek ideal of the divinity of the young, male body).  Thus, Hegel&#39;s aesthetics tie Greek idealizing of the male form to the Christ&#39;s union of mortal and divine bodies.  I read Keats as, at some level, saying, &quot;If this were a modern piece of European art, we&#39;d know a god from a mortal.  And anyway, these damned Protestants tell us we can&#39;t represent the divine in material form anyway.  But the Grecian urn comes from a time and place where the mortal was divine, where the material was ideal, where imagination and the real world were totally inextricable.&quot;  </p>

<p>One question, Scott: just because Keats would be aware of Reynolds (and vice versa), why would Keats -- writing for immortality like a good Romantic -- expect his readers to know that he&#39;s referencing Reynolds?  Most poets aren&#39;t that subtle with their allusions!</p></span>

Very, Very Fast</strong> It should've been just another sentence, one more soldier marching through my twenty-minute presentation on &quot;The New Interdisciplinary.&quot; Now it's a bad apple threatening to spoil the entire ... soldier barrel. Metaphors aside, my interests have expanded to accommodate what I created (albeit accidentally) to prove my original point. To wit: Reading through the academic literature on blogging, I detected notes of vintage 1999 Wired. Scholars wrote as if the bubble had never burst, as if the wildest posthuman dreams were being fulfilled in an interpenetrative blogospheric mêlée. Such language reminded me less of scholarship than the transformation of quantum physics into insipid neospiritual pablum à la What the #$*! Do We Know?!. So I decided to include a sentence—a single, solitary sentence—debunking the idea that one lone voice can be heard in the wilderness, that in truth the blogosphere is highly hierarchical, and that the likelihood of that voice being heard depends on cultivating the wilderness in which bloggers scream. Not that lungs don't matter: the more powerful and engaging the writer, the more likely he or she will be to find and retain an audience. Finding that audience, as any blogger knows, is a difficult task. But given effective quality control, an audience could be enticed to follow strains of thought personally and disciplinarily foreign, i.e. outside idiosyncratic and professional interests. [1] As my 500 devout readers know, I'm a dogged (if amateur) empiricist. I cannot simply make a claim: I must do everything I in my power to verify it. I can't put sentence-to-processor without doing my best to establish its validity. Instead of slapping that sentence down the auto-save abyss, I decided to post something. Little did I know, that sentence would blossom into a meme—which, as Scott McLemee reminds us, &quot;appeals to bloggers because it has 'me' in it, twice.&quot; Not just any meme, mind you, but one I barely have the time, energy, or proper equipment and training to track. It may have even crashed my campus network. It could be a coincidence (it is) that it went down for half an hour (three, actually) while I ran my experiment, but I like to think (on occasion, but always poorly) that the awesome computing power (a Leading Edge Model D86, duct tape, ABC Laffy Taffy) behind my little science fair project (1st Place: Jimmy's Amazing! Volcano) brought the (bring it on!), brought the (oh, it's been brought)—Can you excuse me a minute? [2] Where was I? Right, that sentence blossomed into a meme I'm almost unqualified to track. People may think, &quot;Why then did you propose it? Just to get a little attention?&quot; No. I thought it'd scuttle the margins of the academic blogosphere, crawl whimpering under the couch and expire. Why? Because of its lame content: If you're interested in academic blogging and presentations at the MLA, check this box. Enthralling, ain't it? Turns out it is. Now, if I only knew what to make of it ... [1] Speaking of the latter...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/12/a_gruesome_remi.html"><span><strong>A Gruesome Reminder: Part I</strong> Exhausted from a week of writing nonstop, I decided to spend the day—wait for it, wait for it—reading for fun. I know, I don't believe me either. But like the fellow whose &quot;autobiography&quot; looms large in my current chapter, I cannot tell a lie: I whittled away the day reading books and magazines irrelevant to my dissertation. Or so I thought: [Seymour] Hicks wrote, &quot;There is no doubt that as the years rolled on, the home life of this little peddler of patent medicines must have been anything but a rest cure...&quot; (130) I've written about this phenomenon before, but the experience of reading Erik Larson's Thunderstruck doesn't fit the &quot;Strawberries Under Ice&quot; paradigm. As I wrote the April before last, David Quammen's essay &quot;demonstrates how a scholar's research colors all aspects of his or her life, creating meaningful but ultimately irrelevant juxtapositions of research and lived experience.&quot; How? He writes: Ablation is the scientists' fancy word for loss. Down here the mass balance is negative. Ice is supplied to this zone mainly by flow from above, little or not at all by direct precipitation, and whatever does come as direct precipitation is less than the amount annually lost. The loss results from several different processes: wind erosion, surface melting, evaporation (ice does evaporate), underside melting of an ice shelf where it rests on the warmer seawater. Calving off of icebergs. Calving is the scientists' quaint word for that event when a great hunk of ice—as big as a house, or in some cases, as big as a country—tears away from the leading edge of the sheet or glacier and falls thunderously into the sea. (200) The diction of that first sentence seems to signal the coming of something metaphorical. Instead, Quammen describes how ablation whittles away at everything from ice cubes to Antarctica. He demands readers not interpret ablation metaphorically; his tone and diction demand otherwise. For example: Possibly this talk about calving reflects an unspoken sense that the larger ice mass, moving, pulsing, constantly changing its shape, is almost alive. If so the analogy doesn't go far. Icebergs don't suckle or grow. They float away on the sea, melt, break apart, disappear. Wind erosion and evaporation and most of those other ablative processes work on the ice slowly, incrementally. Calving on the other hand is abrupt. A large piece of the whole is there, and then gone. The strange asyndetons—the rhetorical term for omitting conjunctions—in the second and fourth sentences aside, this paragraph's plain-spoken science entices readers to relate these glaciological facts to Quammen, his life or that much-maligned abstraction, &quot;the human condition.&quot; Calving is a fact of glaciation, not an analogy by which humans can come to understand the processes governing their lives. &quot;The analogy,&quot; Quammen insists, &quot;doesn't go far.&quot; But how then to explain the next paragraph? I came home to find a note in my door. The note said that a young woman I knew, the great love of a friend of mine, was dead...</span></a></div>
