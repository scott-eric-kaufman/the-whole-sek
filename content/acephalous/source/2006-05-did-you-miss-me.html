<p>We COULD go down the theory=bad work, teaching, thinking route. But we&#39;d end up in the logjam named &quot;No, you&#39;re wrong. And here&#39;s evidence. I&#39;M evidence.&quot; Right? </p>

<p>But a more productive discussion would be one, I think, that takes up the question of why exactly we do what we do. My major issue with your post was that I saw a paucity - or even a complete lack - of Actual Intellectual Questions driving this intellectual biography. Which I&#39;m sure is not really the case. I&#39;m as hardcore careerist, in certain senses, as they come. But my careerism still takes second place - a distant second place - to the issues that I&#39;ve been trying to work out for myself from, well, childhood, it increasingly seems to me. (Having a child on the verge of intellectual life - interaction with the real world / language vs. just the boob - has been pounding me with this day in and day out for a few months now). I have found that the closer that I keep to the issues that are actually important to me, what keeps me up at night thinking and reading and writing, the happier I am and, so far, the better I do. </p>

<p>The trick, as is always the trick in intellectual production, is adapting what is most authentically mine to what the market demands. In other words, communication, which is always a compromise. If it became a question of &quot;what the market demands&quot; in exclusion of what is mine - if I couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t do what I like, even in pseudo-samizdat - why bother? This work is too hard and unrewarding to play at it like a game. </p>

<p>In a sense, for me, blogging is a means to keep close to What It Is That I Am Truly Interested In. This is the flip side of the whole critique of anonymous blogging. I am allowed to take pot shots without taking blame, yes. But on the other hand, why is it that I am even here? Why keep the blog if no credits accrue to my meatself? </p></span>

		<span id="comment-17551806-content"><p>&quot;And, finally, responding to the flurry of debate about a certain novel by a certain expat Russian novelist &quot;</p>

<p>Which oddly enough came up here too -- guess where.</p>

<p>Unrelatedly, CR writes:</p>

<p>&quot;We COULD go down the theory=bad work, teaching, thinking route. But we&#39;d end up in the logjam named &quot;No, you&#39;re wrong. And here&#39;s evidence. I&#39;M evidence.&quot; Right? </p>

<p>But a more productive discussion would be one, I think, that takes up the question of why exactly we do what we do.&quot;</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it a commonplace, though, that questions that anyone has from childhood are the questions that never get answered?  So that the questions that actually affect what we work on tend to be the adult ones.  That said, Scott&#39;s description of why he thinks as he does does not seem to be dependent merely on particular teachers, or a lack of intellectual engagement with important questions.  Rather it seems that he describes his involvement with a style that he thought could help him answer questions, and that he decided couldn&#39;t.  That&#39;s what &quot;intellectual seriousness&quot; means in this context, I think.</p>

<p>I agree that the impulse among theory&#39;s detractors to universalize it as bad work, teaching, thinking should be avoided.  After all, it&#39;s part of the humanities at this point, and it&#39;s pretty much part of the self-definition of the humanities that no widespread historical style can be fully &quot;bad&quot;.  But at some point theory is going to occupy the same status vis-a-vis what you&#39;re doing as the New Criticism, right?  It&#39;s historically inevitable.</p></span>

Or perhaps that&#39;s too pragmatic, but the meaning of &quot;works&quot; has to take the academic, scholarly context into account, I would think, so it isn&#39;t really an individual criterion.  Scott&#39;s particular criticisms have always struck me as being of the variety I&#39;d paraphrase as &quot;Academia demands a certain kind of carefulness which theory discourages&quot; -- carefulness both in the sense of considerating alternates and justifying one&#39;s preference among them.  </p></span>

<p>Well, questions don&#39;t really demand anything other than as part of a rhetorical expression, nor does &quot;the world&quot;, so I hope that you don&#39;t mind if I treat these first two as being synonyms for what you demand of yourself.  But academia does demand certain things in a sociological, subcultural, scholarly norms kind of way.</p>

<p>One of the recurring criticisms of theory is that it encourages every academic to try to be a Nietzsche.  There&#39;s a sort of fundamental problem there, it seems to me.  Not everyone can be Nietzsche, and Nietzsche did his well-known work after he had to give up being an academic.</p></span>

<p>Yep. It surely does. Sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. But no one writes innovative work by aiming directly at the bullseye of the scholarly norm. It&#39;s a dialectic, Rich... </p>

<p><i>One of the recurring criticisms of theory </i></p>

<p>Well, at least in these parts. </p>

<p>You know what, the &quot;Accept Your Probable Mediocrity&quot; argument isn&#39;t the greatest argument ever invented. It&#39;s kind of hilariously dumb, actually... Like, literary academia should trade theory for something more appropriate to the bottom quartile of grad students. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-17652440-content"><p>The &quot;Accept Your Probable Mediocrity&quot; argument is pretty funny, yes.  But there&#39;s an element of seriousness to it, even (and no, I&#39;m not writing this to wind you up) an element of leftist politics.  If someone really wants to be the Nietzschean Superperson, and has the talent or whatever to do it, then academic norms aren&#39;t going to stop them.  But telling everyone that they should aspire to be that is no longer really Nietzschean; it has more to do with celebrity culture and late capitalism.  Theory is mostly an American movement, right?  Well, this is the American Dream -- don&#39;t be concerned about what ordinary people do, because you always can pull yourself up by your bootstraps into superstardom if you work hard enough.  A leftist society is supposed to have meaningful work not only for the lowest quartile, but for the next two quartiles -- hey, you&#39;re probably considered &quot;mediocre&quot; if you&#39;re in the lowest 99%.  (I wonder whether a study of numbers of citations would show that the top 1% of people cited have a greater proportion of the total than the top 1% of the U.S. population have of wealth?  But I digress.  There&#39;s really nothing wrong with having the distribution of citations be so skewed, because academia is supposed to be a meritocracy.)</p>

<p>A lot of the folkways of academia are supposed to free you from this kind of thing.  Tenure, for instance, means among other things that you don&#39;t have to always worry about what you&#39;ve done lately is brilliant enough to keep you your job.  Disciplinary norms mean that you&#39;re supposed to be able to use other people&#39;s work and contribute your own as something useful, even if not groundbreaking.  Sure, no one aims &quot;directly at the bullseye of the scholarly norm&quot;, but there&#39;s a serious question of how high you&#39;re going to habitually try for.  Because once it becomes everyone&#39;s habit to try to answer the really important questions, then it really does become funny.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-17668842-content"><p>Well, I know physics.  In physics there are well-determined routes by which you can try, fail, and still end up doing useful work.  In astrophysics, for instance, there&#39;s a convention of titling papers &quot;In Search Of X&quot;, which translates into &quot;I looked for X and didn&#39;t find it.&quot;  That is publisheable because it&#39;s still useful information to the next person who might think of looking for X or the theorist who might base a theory on X not being detected.</p>

<p>The point being, I&#39;m not sure that a heavily Theory-dependent work that tries and fails really leaves much.  If Scott&#39;s dissertation turns out to not conclude anything remarkeable, it&#39;ll still be looked at by the next person to work on that time/place, for the value of its accumulated research.  If someone tries to be the next critical Eliot and fails, they&#39;ll still be expert on whatever works they consider.  But if you try to write like Derrida and fail, what are you left with?  Not much.  I&#39;m not saying that people actually want to be Nietzsche or Derrida (although it&#39;s a useful analogy), but a mediocre version of anything like Derrida&#39;s style wouldn&#39;t produce anything useful to anyone.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-17670374-content"><p>Dear God, Rich.  Kindly point to the place where you demonstrate that you&#39;ve carefully read and understood *any* Derrida, if you would say such clichéd, tiresome things.</p>

<p>I suppose it&#39;s of little use pointing out how your argument rather <em>depends</em> upon repeating the caricature of Derrida as rock-star, and the caricature of his students as mere stylistic sycophants and vain imitators.  </p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s some truth to these observations (and plenty of bad examples one could cite in support of them), but it&#39;s finally neither very useful nor interesting to dwell on (as anything but a cheap shot, really) come the end of the day.  It&#39;s like dwelling on the decades-old dregs as an excuse to blame the coffee for some inherent, fundamental flaw, when there&#39;s plenty of rather good new combinations of coffee out there, if only one cares to look.</p>

<p>I mean, not everything the man said was an enigmatic tone poem, after all.  He was capable of being as clear as any number of analytic philosophers, and this clarity (and generosity, especially in interviews) was arguably as much a part of his &quot;style&quot; as anything.</p>

<p>Out of genuine curiosity though, could you provide an example?  Would something like <a href="http://reconstruction.eserver.org/024/mella.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> fit the &#39;nothing useful to anyone&#39; bill?  Something else?</p>

<p>Do you think these analogies with what is useful in astrophysics might possibly be a little stretched?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-17670400-content"><p>You are totally unaware of the current mode of writing in literary humanities. I don&#39;t mean to be rude, but seriously, you are. First off, no one &quot;tries to write like Derrida.&quot; Not in American literature departments anyway. Secondly, of course theoretically inflected work adds to the storehouse of knowledge, whether totally successful (what would this mean?) or mostly not (what would this mean?) </p>

<p>Say I want to write on, I dunno, Defoe&#39;s Journal of the Plague Year. I look around a find a 1980s upsurge in Foucauldian readings of the text - it&#39;s all about emergent forms of discipline etc... Well, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ALL about emergent forms of discipline, I think it&#39;s also about an upsurge in human activity in the face of death / modernity. I build upon this Foucauldian material, which in fact makes my finding all the more interesting, doesn&#39;t it, and cite it and argue with it, and move forward into my own specific perspective. </p>

<p>When you talk about &quot;theory-dependent work,&quot; it sounds like you mean &quot;just pulling stuff out of your ass.&quot; Which, well, has happened of course, I&#39;m sure. But it is not a specifically theoretical problem. The idea that theoretically inflected research and argument closes the door to the furtherance of some sort of knowledge is just plain wrong. </p>

<p>It just seems like you imagine departments full of junior faculty generating piles of derivative versions of Glas or something. Nope....</p>

<p>There are dangers with both the theoretical model and the democracy of physicists model and what you&#39;re deploying as Scott&#39;s model, to be sure. Theorists work under the threat of overestimating the provocation value of their findings. (Finding the symptoms of imperialist ideologies in Joseph Conrad isn&#39;t going to end imperialism). Physicists (your physicists above) risk banality - my lab notebooks recording the velocity of the beer cans hitting the floor every night as I type on here probably won&#39;t really push the paradigms forward. The &quot;research&quot; driven model of humanities writing - well - risks the same thing. All datapoints without a point, any actual reason to read it. </p></span>

<p>This, of course, wasn&#39;t a backhanded slap at Scott, whose work I haven&#39;t read, sounds very interesting, so much as an anxiety that I&#39;ve experienced myself, in my own work (surprise surprise). Loading the text with Pertinent Historical Contextualization until the argument itself disappears under the weight of what Little Man A told the Manchester Shipward Reporter in 1897, the color of the socks that Little Man B wore the day he left Bolton, that sort of thing. </p>

<p>Like, I guess someone might find it useful someday. Sometimes it&#39;s hard to imagine whom, exactly. </p>

<p>But just wanted to make clear, that there&#39;s a danger in this model too. Banality. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-17676441-content"><p>CR writes: &quot;You know what, the &quot;Accept Your Probable Mediocrity&quot; argument isn&#39;t the greatest argument ever invented. It&#39;s kind of hilariously dumb, actually... Like, literary academia should trade theory for something more appropriate to the bottom quartile of grad students.&quot; </p>

<p>I have a feeling that CR is hereby referencing an argument I made some time back. If so, I would just like to be on the record as stating that this is a kind of hilariously, um, not correct reading of my argument. (If CR says he definitely didn&#39;t have me in mind, but some actual to gosh mediocrity-advocate he dug up somewhere, I retract my complaint.) </p>

<p>If CR does have me in mind, then the source of his trouble is a failure to distinguish between advocacy of mediocrity, on the one hand, and concern about a rather specific, characteristic sort of slippage between scholarly rhetoric and the realities of scholarship, on the other. There are demands for results, and then there are demands for resultiness, if you will. Resultiness in the humanities is often cobbled together out of bits extracted from the edifice of philosophy - you daub and ornament your work with a trimming of anti-foundationalist paradigm-busting, for example; when really there was just this nice thing you noticed about Robinson Crusoe. Or whatever it may have been. I was trying to illustrate this very problem with some close readings in my discussion of Armstrong&#39;s &quot;How Novels Think&quot;. But CR didn&#39;t exactly buy it, if I recall.</p>

<p>At any rate, I think it is important to meditate on the institutional maw that demands to be fed with resultiness. And I do not think this amounts to advocating mediocrity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, who can be brave and strong, in a scholarly sense, without indulging in a bit of self-promotional resultiness? But in conceding so much, I think it is important to see that the resultiness-loving portion of our soul is not necessarily the best angel of our natures. Perhaps we should aspire higher, not setting our sights so low.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-17682789-content"><p>&quot;Writing like Derrida&quot; was a phrase that I knew that I shouldn&#39;t have used.  At any rate, no I don&#39;t mean that Derrida wrote enigmatic tone poems.  But at the most basic level, his style of analysis doesn&#39;t seem to me to work unless there&#39;s a big heaping of old-fashioned scholarly carefulness underlying it.</p>

<p>OK, here&#39;s an example, a well-known one so I won&#39;t be accused of criticizing some mediocrity.  Remember the _Scattered Speculations_ essay that there was a symposium on recently?  Perhaps that&#39;s not really in the right subdiscipline, but I believe that Spivak is considered to be a literary critic in addition to being a philosopher.  Compare her treatment of Marxian concepts in that essay with Derrida&#39;s in _Specters of Marx_.  Spivak&#39;s essay is full of &quot;huh?&quot; moments, as in when she turns from a consideration of the labor theory of value to a bit on literary value, then goes back to labor as source of value, with never an explanation of how the two could possibly be related.  (Sure, I accept that literary value and economic value are in some ways related -- but not through labor.)  Derrida never in any place in _Specters of Marx_ that I noticed uses a play on words merely to elide, rather than to illustrate, consideration of some analytic concept.</p>

<p>Now Spivak is of course a superstar rather than an average academic toiling away.  But I don&#39;t think that this particular essay of hers seems very useful, frankly.  Derrida&#39;s book wasn&#39;t what I in particular was looking for, since I thought that it was going to address the ostensible topic &quot;Whither Marxism?&quot; in a more sustained way than it did; I don&#39;t think that the 3-4 pages on the &quot;New International&quot; broke any new ground.  But it still appeared to me to be a great literary reading of Marx.  As such it in a certain sense represents a useful failure by my criteria.  Spivak&#39;s essay, on the other hand, is based on an imperial overstretch into economics that I think can only result in confusion.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-17683377-content"><p>I was referring to Rich&#39;s instantiation of it above. Yours is more elegant. I&#39;ve found it very valuable to think about, actually, since we last discussed it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a double edged sword, I think. The way I&#39;d put it: On the one hand, theory encourages engagement in matters philosophic, social, political. Engagement is good, to my mind. Better than &quot;this pentameter is so damn iambic.&quot; (I&#39;ve done that - btw. My start was at an undergraduate program where I read not a single work of theory. Just poetry, heaps of it, and a couple novels). On the other hand, yes, theory may encourage a false sense of engagement when there&#39;s none there.</p>

<p>(Since engagement for me is a good thing - my version of your theory is inverted. Rather than &quot;forces people toward resultiness,&quot; I&#39;d say &quot;encourages them to see it where its not.&quot;)</p>

<p>So, I think you too might fail to distinguish between advocacy and concern, but in the other direction.</p>

Writing it clarified some issues for me and my interlocutor, so I thought I'd post another version up here tonight. I've decided to elide the names of those persons who don't have a significant web-presence, since I don't have their permission to write about their lives and work. There's something about modernist literature which lends itself to and/or is consonant with continental philosophy. Joyce, Proust, Woolf, &amp;c. attract people who study Lacan, Deleuze, Derrida, &amp;c. The attraction is some combination of the characteristics of the text and the characteristics of the minds attracted to such texts, but whatever the explanation, the effect is palpable. There's certainly a relationship between continental philosophy and European modernism, as evidenced by the fact that almost everyone who works on the latter does so through the former. I'm being careful here to specify &quot;continental philosophy&quot; instead of Theory, since it's &quot;continental philosophy&quot; and not Theory which interests literary modernists. The reason? Modernism starts, depending on who you ask, with the European-inflected thought of William James on Gertrude Stein; or with Bergson's influence on Woolf and Joyce; or with any number of French intellectuals on Joyce, Beckett, and Pound; &amp;c. There's a kind of historicist heart to the modernist's embrace of continental philosophy, since it's often essential to understanding the formal properties of the works being studied or the works which have influenced them. So, as an undergraduate I studied with M.P., a Joycean who split time between Santa Cruz and Paris in the '70s. He attended Lacan's seminars, worked with Derrida, and wrote a dissertation on Joyce under the direction of Fredric Jameson and Hayden White. (In graduate school, he, T.B.—now a notorious historicist—and M.B.W.—now just notorious—were close friends.) M.P. fancied himself a continental philosopher of sorts, but when he hit the market, he was considered a &quot;theorist&quot; because he was a continental philosopher of sorts who worked in an English department. My graduate school agenda, hatched with M.P. during many a long office hour, was to continue to massage my philosophically-inclined Joycean interests by coming to Irvine, where I could work with Derrida (who got a backchannel letter from M.P. vouching for me, a copy of which was sent to N.M., a prominent Wake scholar. To round out my undergraduate education, I sought out a guy in the French department named John Protevi. (You may know him as a frequent commenter on Michael's blog.) He's the editor of the Yale University Press's Dictionary of Continental Philosophy, and his personal interests are in Foucault and all things Deleuzoguattarian. He and I clicked, so I started reading Foucault and many things Deleuzoguattarian, learning about the conflicts internal to the continental tradition. So my graduate project, such that it was, entailed me coming to Irvine and continuing this course of study. When I got here, however, I discovered what I still take to be the central difference...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/viral_erudition.html"><span><strong>Lovely Viral Erudition</strong> &quot;How much time 'til that post's done?&quot; &quot;Another 15 minutes at least.&quot; As CR noted, my intellectual biography revolved around the professors I worked with more than the ideas they helped me think through.* I could chalk that up to the empahsis of that particular post, but there's something to the notion that we adapt to our intellectual environs, and that the most imposing predators therein are the professors we work with. Let me weave a few conversations together here: CR: &quot;I have found that the closer that I keep to the issues that are actually important to me, what keeps me up at night thinking and reading and writing, the happier I am and, so far, the better I do. The trick, as is always the trick in intellectual production, is adapting what is most authentically mine to what the market demands.&quot; Laura: &quot;But my point is that you’re wrong to claim that love must end before 'pointed interest' (which I take to be the most you think a professional critic ought to own up to) can begin. You’ve every right to say there’s no place for love in your personal experience of writing about literature, and perhaps even within the culture of your institution, but there are no grounds for asserting that it’s also how things must work for everybody else. Reasoned, communicable academic scholarship and criticism is perfectly compatible with love, warmth, pleasure, curiosity, respect and enjoyment. I would even go so far as to say the very best criticism must harbour some sympathy for the object of its attention. It’s a negative capability thing. Marco Roth: &quot;It seems to me that an interesting debate could be had about the idea of love implied in the essay. Can’t we go from love of a single author to love of styles that remind us of our first love? Can the circle of our affections widen without betraying us to pseudo-science? But surely the purpose of a profession ought to have some relationship to the reasons people have for entering it. And—thinking psychologically rather than professionally—what does actually happen in English departments?&quot; Now thrust this all into the intellectual environment of an English department during graduate study and witness love's ideal evolution: You come to graduate school with love. You're forced to adapt that love to professional ends, preferably without soiling or despoiling it, in order to survive graduate school. You take your professionalized love to the MLA and hope that it enhances your performance and increases the odds that you'll land a job you can stomach. You land such a job and allow that love to guide your intellectual development for the rest of your days. Somewhere beneath that professional veneer your first love continues to inform the work. The formal properties of the academic article deaden interest in their content. Love enlivens the tired form. It inflates the flattened prose and communicates to the reader its contagion. Case in point. Now I'm gonna read Shakespeare. Why? Greenblatt...</span></a></div>
