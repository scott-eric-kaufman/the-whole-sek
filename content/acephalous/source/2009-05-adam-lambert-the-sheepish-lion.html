<p>Only it that addressed the survival of the fittest and defined fitness in both social and natural terms.  I don&#39;t remember it doing that.  </p>

<p><em>And if our adult scholarship really is prefigured in our childhood culture, how is it that I write in the style of Isaac Asimov instead of Harlan Ellison, both of whom figured heavily in my early reading?</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s because they don&#39;t let historians write like Ellison, but Asimov often wrote in a quasi-historical register, right?  (I&#39;m thinking <em>Foundation</em> here, but you see what I mean.)</p>

<p><em>Are you saying that we need to excise all versions of the story from our culture if we want to get beyond the Lamarckian-Darwinian debate? </em></p>

<p>Silly boy, we&#39;re <em>never</em> going to get beyond the Lamarckian-Darwinian debate.  We might not realize we&#39;re still working on its terms, or even remember what those terms originally were, but we&#39;re never getting past them.  Mark my words.</p></span>

<p><i>Asimov often wrote in a quasi-historical register, right? (I&#39;m thinking Foundation here, but you see what I mean.)</i></p>

<p>Not only that, the man wrote actual histories. So, yeah, it&#39;s more natural for me professionally. But there&#39;s an Ellison in there somewhere.....</p>

<p>I wonder how many of the iconic comic book artists (I&#39;m thinking of the ones on the sidebar of your course website, plus Gaiman) read Ellison. Miller&#39;s stuff, in particular, has a real resonance with Harlan&#39;s stuff. So does Moore&#39;s. Maybe it&#39;s just generational echoes, but I was reading something recently (I wish I remember what, but I&#39;ve been working through the comic book shelf at the local library in honor of the end of classes. I&#39;ve read &quot;Marvel 1602&quot; and &quot;Eternals&quot; and &quot;Ronin&quot; and &quot;300&quot; and a bunch of lesser stuff) and saw a &quot;Boy and His Dog&quot; reference that jumped out at me.</p></span>

<p>I started reading your blog a few months ago but this is my first comment, which is relevant only tangentially.  Your post (which I enjoyed) reminds me of an anecdotal presentation Scott McCloud gave at a TED conference a few years ago.  McCloud briefly referred to the conference‚Äôs theme,  ‚ÄúInspired by Nature,‚Äù when he told the fable of the frog who agrees to carry a scorpion to the other side of a river only to be stung by the scorpion halfway across the water.   Before they both sink to their deaths, the frog asks the scorpion why he‚Äôd do something so stupid, to which the scorpion replies, ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs my nature.‚Äù  Although McCloud understood himself as having gone astray from his father‚Äôs way of looking at the world, the ‚Äúroad to discovery‚Äù McCloud took throughout his life proved to be a return to his father‚Äôs outlook.  By becoming a comic book artist, McCloud chose to be something other than scientific, but in the end he couldn‚Äôt help but be what he was, his scientific father‚Äôs son, because such was his nature.  </p>

<p>Cheers from Chicago, <br />

<p>This is what the internet does to you: I had the same thought exactly.</p>

<p>Drip:</p>

<p><em>Lambs social and wolves nature? Really? Wolves are social, sheep are natural too, right?</em></p>

<p>But they&#39;re also stand-ins: the sheep for the internal social dynamics, the wolves as threats from abroad.  Put differently, there are internal threats, but they&#39;re not wolves.</p>

<p>j:</p>

<p><em>I started reading your blog a few months ago but this is my first comment, which is relevant only tangentially.</em></p>

<p>Welcome!  Come for the inanity, stay for the beer, as I always say. <em>Especially</em> if you continue to analogize me as a scorpion, because scorpions are bad ass.  (Note: Lower-case &quot;scorpion&quot; is bad ass, upper-case &quot;Scorpions&quot; not.)</p>

<p>Ahistoricality:</p>

<p>More on Ellison/Moore later, because I actually have a thing on that somewhere around here . . . </p></span>

Spent three hours on the tarmac in Houston waiting for the Continental mechanics to fix something! Drove myself nuts trying to figure out what that something was! Forgot that my sister's almost-fianc√© is an airplane mechanic! For Continental! In Houston! Tuesday! Earthquake! Wednesday! Locked the doors so the strange man with the rifle couldn't shoot my eye out! Wednesday night! Scott McCloud commented on my post about Scott McCloud! Late Wednesday night! My cat Sigmund had a hairball! One minute later Wednesday night! That's not a hairball! Siggy's coughed up blood! Twenty minutes later Thursday morning! I hate the only late night emergency care clinic around here! Reminds me of Rachel! Spent seven hours I should've been asleep waiting for test results! Found out Siggy's problem is he's swallowed a branch of evergreen needles that he can't seem to cough up! Doctor fixed Siggy! This morning at 7:15 a.m.! Jumped in shower!

I leave the strap of my shoulder-bag around my neck. A fidgety kid sits down next to me, looks around, and fidgets. Ten seconds later, he decides he's had enough of that seat. He stands up, grabs my bag and starts to walk away. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; I say. &quot;WHAT?&quot; The room goes dead silent. I point to strap around my neck and say, &quot;I think that's my bag you have there.&quot; &quot;FINE.&quot; Then he drops my bag and walks away. He was loud, but it was an empty roar. No malice to it. Nor do I think he was trying to steal my bag. If pressed, I'd say the kid probably had no clue where or even who he was. He was toast. All of which is only to say, people who have never worked in the quarter system have absolutely no idea what those last few weeks of Spring Quarter are like, because there's nothing comparable to them in the semester system . . . and I think that's probably a good thing.</span></a></div>
