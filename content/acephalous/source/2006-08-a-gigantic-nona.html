		<span id="comment-20792528-content"><p>Just trying to make sure I understand your question:  when I look at the Technorati page, I don&#39;t see that it contradicts itself on the number of blogs who link to you, but on the number of links you&#39;re receiving (i.e., up above, it suggests 699 links, and a bit lower down it suggests 957 links - but it only mentions, to my admittedly teaching-blurred vision, 264 blogs...).</p>

<p>So maybe you can feel secure about the number of blogs (at least within a time frame), but a bit less certain about the number of links...  I can&#39;t find any quick explanation for the difference in link numbers - could be timeframe, could be rationalisation of similar links...</p></span>

		<span id="comment-20824843-content"><p>I share your confusion, or maybe more importantly, I recognize the same problem. Just today I decided to scare up my old post on the book Eragon, from my old blog URL, and it was fascinating. The highest link came from my archive page, but the rest were Russian, Italian and other spam blogs, pretty much. Very depressing, because that&#39;s a complete change from the links that post got when it first came out. Either those other links have disappeared, or aren&#39;t being tracked, or something.</p>

<p>Basically, I think Technorati has lost the struggle that Google is still gamely fighting. I get much cleaner results from Blogpulse. At this point I have no sense of how to read Technorati results any more. <br />

<p>George, I&#39;m not sure how&#39;d that work, since I don&#39;t think they have a relationship with Blogrolling or anything of the sort, and there&#39;s no way to differentiate the HTML of my sidebar from what&#39;s in the text.</p>

<p>Kerry, that page you linked is obsessed with Technorati stats and such.  I suppose someone has to keep the pressure on them for the rest of us.  (Not that it&#39;s working ... )  Anyhow, since I don&#39;t want to seem like a stalker, I&#39;ll say that I&#39;d be interested to see what you&#39;ve linked to of mine and you comments about it.  Unless they&#39;re like &quot;JACKASS-WITH-A-LASER!&quot;  (Actually, even then.)</p>

<p>Bryan, I&#39;ve actually been meaning to add you to the blog-roll, but I wanted to wait until your gracious words about Y.T. were deep in the archives, so as to hide my solipsism from the world.  </p>

<p>A.A., no problem.  I just started reading you when you commented a week or so ago (could&#39;ve been longer, as time slows to a halt here in Dissertation Land).  </p>

<p>I think, however, that I&#39;m going to go with Mr. Burke.  I don&#39;t think I can trust Technorati any farther than I can throw my laptop, and I&#39;m not about to even test how far that is.  (I was a 3B and still have a cannon ... one I don&#39;t want to use on my precious laptop.)  I haven&#39;t tried Blogpulse, but I suppose what I should do now is some cross evaluation.  I&#39;m off!</p></span>

If you'll remember—by which I mean &quot;skim your translated edition of The Canterbury Tales&quot;—the NPT contains 7,392 frame narratives nested, like Russian dolls, around a beast fable about a cock named Chauntecleer who refuses to listen his dreams or wives. So a fox takes him by surprise, grabs him by the mouth and scoots into the woods. Chauntecleer, clever cock he is, tricks the fox into saying something. The fox's mouth momentarily agape, Chauntecleer flap-flap-flaps into the bosom of a nearby tree. That's all the plot you need to know to understand the horrors to follow. (But I recommend reading the afore-linked tale in its entirety. This Chaucer fellow ain't half bad. A decent blogger, even.) So, the fox has the cock in his mou—crap, I gave the game away, didn't I? No choice but to present the offending sentence then: Because the word &quot;cock&quot; passes through the throat of the fox, the thing it signifies will not. When I talk about the rigors of deconstruction being lost on literary scholars, this is what I'm referencing. You see the priceless irony here? As soon as the fox utters the signifier &quot;cock,&quot; he invokes the presence of that which is absent ... only it isn't! The cock was in his mouth when he said &quot;cock&quot;! Therefore, because the word &quot;cock&quot; passes through the throat of the fox, the thing it signifies—Chauntecleer—will not! Where to even begin? Chill, my friend, chill. I have an idea. How about I begin the with the moment when uttering the word &quot;cock&quot; dispossesses said cock from the fox's mouth? This cok, that lay upon the foxes bak, In al his drede unto the fox he spak, And seyde, sire, if that I were as ye, Yet sholde I seyn, as wys God helpe me, Turneth agayn, ye proude cherles alle! A verray pestilence upon yow falle! Now am I come unto the wodes syde; Maugree youre heed, the cok shal heere abyde. I wol hym ete, in feith, and that anon! The fox answerde, in feith, it shal be don. And as he spak that word, al sodeynly This cok brak from his mouth delyverly, And heighe upon a tree he fleigh anon. [This cock, which lay across the fox's back, In all his fear unto the fox did clack And say: &quot;Sir, were I you, as I should be, Then would I say (as God may now help me!), 'Turn back again, presumptuous peasants all! A very pestilence upon you fall! Now that I've gained here to this dark wood's side, In spite of you this cock shall here abide. I'll eat him, by my faith, and that anon!'&quot; The fox replied: &quot;In faith, it shall be done!&quot; And as he spoke that word, all suddenly This cock broke from his mouth, full cleverly, And high upon a tree he flew anon.]...</span></a></div>
