They are just as happy to attack academia for him being fired, and use it to reinforce the trope of &quot;academics are improperly making decisions because of politics.&quot;  Basically, I don&#39;t trust anything they write about this.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I see a lot of high-minded stuff about how the school did more damage by firing him clumsily than it would have by keeping him on.  Really?  The whole new law school is apparently being bankrolled by an O.C. conservative, with primary possible donors other O.C. conservatives.  They want to get what they&#39;ve paid for.  So the university can either fire the guy clumsily, or not have a new law school; I think that it&#39;s naive to think that academics who want jobs are really going to remember this five years from now.  As long as universities depend on business and on business boosters as much as they do, this kind of thing is going to happen.</p>

<p>And, by the way, I think that it&#39;s significant that it happened in law.  Think of the prominent law prof bloggers -- they are mostly not too bright, distinguished only by their wingnuttery.  I&#39;m not surprised that American law, which has brought us so many new developments in the area of executive power, is losing any pretension towards impartiality that it ever had.</p></span>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what I thought.

		<span id="comment-82903781-content"><p>Chemerinsky seems to have accrued a profile in cowardice when it came to the defining scandal of his home institution, the Duke Lacrosse Rape case.  Try Googling his name along with those terms and reading the top results.  For an extremely unflattering contrast, substitute Chemerinsky&#39;s Duke Law School colleague James Coleman&#39;s surname, then repeat the search. </p>

<p>For further insight on how centrists (extremist wingnuts, in the present company) might view a Chemerinsky deanship, see Patterico&#39;s post on the subject.  To save readers the trouble of clicking, here&#39;s the title:  <a href="http://patterico.com/2007/09/13/chemerinsky-gravely-wronged-by-the-university-of-california-but-still-a-shameless-partisan-hack-who-gets-it-wrong-all-the-time/" rel="nofollow">Chemerinsky: Gravely Wronged by the University of California... But Still a Shameless Partisan Hack Who Gets It Wrong All The Time</a>.</p>

<p>That said, none of this was unknown to the nascent law school&#39;s sachems when they extended their offer to Cheminersky.  That a glib, articulate, intelligent, liberal law prof with a record of speaking out on issues of the day (well... <i>most</i> issues of the day) would turn into a dean who&#39;d be likely to do the same... Who Knew?</p>

<p>In other words, the UCI administration&#39;s conduct in the affair has been despicable, and they deserve all the brickbats that have been launched in their direction.</p></span>

<p>If we get into speculation about what they would say in a different set of circumstances, tomemos -- well, what other circumstances?  They are clearly capable of having it both ways at once.  Reading Volokh and others, I&#39;ve seen the usual about how this shows how politicized academia has become, but after all a dean is a dean, and you can&#39;t piss off the funders.  </p></span>

You cited an article from noted wingnut Pattero to us and now have the gall to claim that he &quot;makes arguments that people of the center can appreciate.&quot;   This is an article whose first non-summary sentence is &quot;This has to make the Chancellor of the University of California the biggest bonehead on the face of the planet&quot; and continues into &quot;Chemerinsky really is an intellectually dishonest weasel and a shamelessly hypocritical hack.&quot;  And yet you want credit for being nice and reasoned and civil and not at all as bad as the people whose opinions you routinely pimp.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t deserve a reasoned argument, and you don&#39;t represent &quot;people of the center.&quot;  You&#39;re not a centrist.  I&#39;m not going to say what you really are, since this is Scott&#39;s blog, but I invite you to imagine whatever bad, bad word would most cause you to sniff in disapproval and then go off to support some racist somewhere.</p></span>

Now I'm humming: So kiss me and smile for me, Tell me that you wait for me, Hold me, like you never let me go. 'Cause I'm leaving on a het plane, Don't know when I'll be back again, Oh babe I hate to go ... Some lyrics only applicable in Massachusetts.</span></a></div>

I turned in some material to my adviser four weeks back. Yesterday, I receive an email from [her] that reads: &quot;I'm too busy to read this right now. You should have sent this to me a month ago.&quot; Does [she] mean I should have sent it to her two months ago? Because I sent her [different] material then, to which [she] replied: &quot;I can't look at this now. You should have sent it earlier. You need to be more responsible.&quot; Does this mean I should have sent it to her four months ago? I wouldn't impose on your time, but I'm working on a deadline (which she imposed), and I need feedback on my work if I'm to meet it. The other members of my committee defer to [her]. I need them to stop doing that. I'm not sure how to break [her] &quot;I'm too busy it's the end of the semester/summer of research/beginning of the semester/personal issue/personal issue/personal issue&quot; cycle, nor how to tell the other members of my committee about it so they'll stop deferring to the judgment [she] refuses to render. I've never dealt with an adviser like this, so I'm loath to comment on it. Do some of you have experience with this situation? Or maybe some of the faculty members out there could comment on how you would feel if a graduate student came to you for help with this situation?</span></a></div>
