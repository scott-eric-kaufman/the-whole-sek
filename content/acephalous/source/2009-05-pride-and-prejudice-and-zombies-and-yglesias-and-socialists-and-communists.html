        <meta name="description" content="roy edroso is clearly an intelligent man, but in this case he couldn't be more wrong. He quotes one of the geniuses from Big Hollywood (who, incidentally, just learned what the word &quot;satrap&quot; meant): In their neverending quest to wrest more power by creating what H. L. Mencken correctly characterized as an endless series of hobgoblins requiring a socialist elite’s powers to destroy, the socialists and their media satraps continually raise fears of everything conceivable . . . Then argues that: Naturally he doesn't link; this is from Mencken's In Defense of Women, and the passage from which it comes doesn't mention socialists at all, and is explicitly about the starting and conduct of modern wars, which Mencken attributes to modern civilization &quot;especially under democracy.&quot; But I don't think Karnick was purposely misleading his readers . . . Because Mr. Word-of-the-Day wasn't misleading his readers. roy doesn't seem to realize that conservatives only discovered Seth Graeme-Smith's Pride and Prejudice and Zombies earlier this week and that this Big Hollywood-style satrap is merely playing along. Just like Graeme-Smith improved upon Austen by inserting zombies into scenes in which they clearly don't belong, conservatives are now inserting socialists and communists into diatribes in which they clearly don't belong. For example, Donald Douglas complains that people find the idea of him being a professor beyond belief, but then he writes this: I saved a classic example of the &quot;I can't believe you're a professor&quot; slur from a post last year,&quot; Matt Yglesias, Jennifer Palmieri, and the Third Way.&quot; As some readers know, Matthew Yglesias is an American communist. There is no position that's too far to the left for that man. Clearly, anyone who thinks that there &quot;is no position too far to the left for [Yglesias]&quot; deserves to have his credentials questioned. Off the top of my head, I can list fifteen comments on every one of Yglesias's posts going back seven years as evidence that lefter positions than those he's staked exist. Douglas duct-taped the evidentiary bar to his ankles, so he shouldn't be surprised that people are incredulous when he claims that his day job involves teaching impressionable youths how to hurdle. But it's all a ruse. Douglas is merely playing the zombifying game with socialists and communists. He doesn't believe Yglesias is a communist anymore than Graeme-Smith thinks Austen really wrote about zombies. He's not hilariously obtuse—he's just playing the communitizing game. It's like zombies, only with communists and socialists. I'm surprised (and frankly disappointed) roy didn't pick up on this. Does he seriously believe conservatives have been so traumatized by three months of a painfully centrist presidency that they're spying pinkos in the hedgerows? As if. (x-posted.)" />

<p>Well, TZ often played with the problem of madness -- how can you tell that you&#39;re not insane? -- but I don&#39;t really think the problem began with Obama&#39;s victory. The creation of Fox News put into play a parallel universe, so to speak, an isolated information culture with radically different inputs and filters; blogs, with their tendency to attract like-minded audiences, exacerbate the problem.<br />

For some reason, I thought last year was largely drama-free, and it was . . . except for all the drama. (I'll save my meta-thoughts about Proust and journals for another day.) The Funny: Elderly Jews deserve our scorn. HA HA HA not funny. IT IS ALWAYS ALREADY CURTAINS FOR ME! In what follows I will be writing about signposts. I am become Hunter S. Thompson. This a finely crafted I wrote. What is it, with students and, with commas? Dawg, we is underscrewed. The Great California Earthquake Drill of 2008. Who will weep for the ugly duckling? &quot;He longs longingly at his creation, his only wish that he could experience its birth again.&quot; Cylons have to eat too. &quot;It is a descriptive word. Its description is emotional and resonates to people who have emotions.&quot; .edoc eht kcarc ot sdrawkcab ti daeR Why this blog isn't good anymore. Nothing is ever merely anything. ASCII is too awesome. Interview with a candidate for many jobs (but winner of none). Never has the ding been so pleasant. Tell me everything I need to know to be an expert. &quot;fine i dont hear from u soon u reget it[.]&quot; A brief history of bobulates. Never let cats chat. A goal accomplished. SEK is hating Facebook. Then Socrates admits it was always about the hats. Who among us doesn't aspire to be the Manny Ramirez of academia? &quot;I devoted my life to that study for nearly three weeks, but when I re-read it, I realized I was utterly full of shit.&quot; My best Charles Atlas imitation. The Serious: This day in (fictional) history. Because who ever saw a black person swimming? Can anyone justify teaching Huck Finn? Liberal Fascism is a rank stupid book. No, really, Liberal Fascism is a rank stupid book. That thing I did with the voter registration data that got linked everywhere but was stupid dull writing-wise. The fine line between literary criticism and rank paranoia. That would be pretty damn important. Who really wrote that book the with the pResident's name on it? The first ever time I mentioned Watchmen on the blog. His death still bothers me. John Ziegler is an asshole. Two bits on The Wire. The Still Seriously Sad: &quot;.&quot;</span></a></div>

This hard work, it frightens then crushes me. That damnable Library. Further damnation. The Ur-Troll. January Writing about talking about blogging. Imitating Montaigne. Helping out. Irritation. February Teeth. In a book. Something from that probably. Unexamined &quot;the.&quot; Cerebus, Cerebus, conservatives, Cerebus. March Uncomfortably redacted (in verse). PROFANITY. Cerebus, conservatives. n+anger. Have system, will profit. April Michel, Michel, from whence craig. Help! Stop! Policing! Purpose. May Picketing. Lawyers win. Talking pictures. June Iceberg? Uh-oh. Like, seriously. Is he insane? (Yes.) (This one too.) (And him.) (This one? A good egg.) Boobs from nothing. WHARTON! More lawyers winning. Him? No way. Reader-generated content. Headless Lenin speaks, dances. July Cute bunnies avoid terrible violence. The many faces of Hillary Clinton. Who is to be breaking up with whom in a parking lot? Enthusiastic banging inside [his] skull. Emily Dickinson did it. &quot;It was only then, on the night before we shipped out to Iraq, as I reviewed my troops that I would be leading into battle, that I began to have doubts about the declining standards of the National Guard. Yes, we hit the enrollment targets, sure. But with what sort of men? A guy so inordinately proud of his chest bush that he refused to wear his fatigues, an ape from the San Diego zoo, a Star Wars nut who was scared to appear in public without his R2D2 getup, and an illegal Mexican wrestler who went by 'el vaquero secreto'? It was, in short, the moment when I should have known that les jeux sont faits. We were well and truly fucked.&quot; [via CR] August How to win your heart into hot undergrads pants. Obama has always already won the nomination. Now we elect the MAYOR OF SEXYTOWN. Cookies! September My suicide attempt. Violations of listserv etiquette. Egregious violations of listserv etiquette. Work Bird sees your thumbs twiddling. I'm less mad about you than enraged at you. The wheat. Adam Roberts loves the wheat. Self-referential wormhole. Pity poor David Duke. Minority literature? Scum on the barrel bottom's blistered backside. Behave! October O to strangle that nagging feeling! I am (not) becoming intimidating. Uppity little snots be damned. Don't be an asshole. I dream the lameness heroic. All ur functions r under erasure. Learn to format. November Everybody come laugh at the doofus. Springsteen in the classroom? &quot;MY NAME IS EXOTIC TO YOU. By Exotic To You. (Smith, Johnson, White and Smith, $25) This is a powerful book about a powerful brown person who lives a powerful life in America.&quot; Who chooses whom again? The Munch Paradox. December Why you won't deserve the job you land. Why I won't deserve the job I land. Liberal Fascism: two words next to each other. Foster Wallace's future of politics and advertisement. How SEK hid cancer from his wife. &quot;I have been bested,&quot; SEK said. &quot;Commence my hilarious penance.&quot; The third installment wasn't divided by months....</span></a></div>
