Part II will be up tomorrow.] David Axe's War Is Boring belongs, in a very general sense, to the grand tradition of American road trip narratives. Unlike Steinbeck's Travels with Charley, in which the Nobel Laureate set out to reconnect with an idea of America; or Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, in which the good doctor set out to obliterate that notion altogether; or Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, in which a creative writing professor ignores both the country and all notions of it in favor of calling attention to his own profundity—that is to say, unlike those nonfictional account of road trips by American authors, the travel narrative that frames War Is Boring is not aimed at an American audience. I mean this literally: Axe recalls the past five years of his life as a United Nations van and its driver, Adrian Djimdim, shepherd him across Chad. That he tells his story to someone who has experienced life in a conflict zone is significant because it allows him the sympathetic space required to recount the intimate moments and minor worries of combat life without seeming a solipsist. The wars to which he flashes back in conversation are not about him in the way that Salinas is about Steinbeck, Las Vegas about Thompson, or Pirsig about Pirsig. They are not an extension of himself because War Is Boring partakes of no Emersonian &quot;upbuilding of a man&quot; and Axe refuses to serve as a delegate for our moral improvement. For example, later in the novel, after being mistaken for former U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix, he informs Djimdim that: As Djimdim is presented as an observant listener, he must have recognized that Axe had fed him a similar line earlier: Note that the difference is not in growth, but simple addition: Axe doesn't correct him, he merely adds the names of his actual employers, committing what could be called a sin of omission by addition. He presents himself here not as a model to be emulated, but a person for whom old, successful habits die hard—that is, as a sympathetic example of our flawed species.* But War Is Boring is always as much about the narrative as it is the narrator, even when the stakes of the conflicts narrated are not altogether clear. While that might seem a criticism of the book, I don't mean it as such. The view from the ground will always be more chaotic than its aerial equivalent, as Axe himself argues via juxtapositions like those that open his chapter on East Timor: The helicopter is as isolated from the events below as it is in Axe's camera, but for the moment, so is Axe.

			<p>[<em>I&#39;m breaking this review into separate posts.  Part II will be up tomorrow.</em>]</p>
<p>David Axe&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451230116/diesekoschmar-20"><em>War Is Boring</em></a> belongs, in a very general sense, to the grand tradition of American road trip narratives. Unlike Steinbeck&#39;s <em>Travels with Charley</em>, in which the Nobel Laureate set out to reconnect with an idea of America; or Thompson&#39;s <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</em>, in which the good doctor set out to obliterate that notion altogether; or Pirsig&#39;s <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>,  in which a creative writing professor ignores both the country and all  notions of it in favor of calling attention to his own profundity—that  is to say, unlike <em>those</em> nonfictional account of road trips by American authors, the travel narrative that frames <em>War Is Boring</em> is not aimed at an American audience. I mean this literally: Axe  recalls the past five years of his life as a United Nations van and its  driver, Adrian Djimdim, shepherd him across Chad. That he tells his  story to someone who has experienced life in a conflict zone is  significant because it allows him the sympathetic space required to  recount the intimate moments and minor worries of combat life without  seeming a solipsist.</p>
<p>The wars to which he flashes back in conversation are not about him  in the way that Salinas is about Steinbeck, Las Vegas about Thompson, or  Pirsig about Pirsig. They are not an extension of himself because <em>War Is Boring</em> partakes of no Emersonian &quot;upbuilding of a man&quot; and Axe refuses to  serve as a delegate for our moral improvement. For example, later in the  novel, after being mistaken for former U.N. weapons inspector Hans  Blix, he informs Djimdim that:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/axe01.jpg"><img alt="" height="261" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/axe01.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="axe01" width="454" /></a></p>
<p>As Djimdim is presented as an observant listener, he must have recognized that Axe had fed him a similar line earlier:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/axe02.jpg"><img alt="" height="402" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/axe02.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="axe02" width="425" /></a></p>
<p>Note that the difference is not in growth, but simple addition: Axe  doesn&#39;t correct him, he merely adds the names of his actual employers,  committing what could be called a sin of omission by addition. He  presents himself here not as a model to be emulated, but a person for  whom old, successful habits die hard—that is, as a sympathetic example  of our flawed species.* But <em>War Is Boring</em> is always as much about  the narrative as it is the narrator, even when the stakes of the  conflicts narrated are not altogether clear. While that might seem a  criticism of the book, I don&#39;t mean it as such. The view from the ground  will always be more chaotic than its aerial equivalent, as Axe himself  argues via juxtapositions like those that open his chapter on East  Timor:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/axe03.jpg"><img alt="" height="543" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/axe03.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="axe03" width="363" /></a></p>
<p>The helicopter is as isolated from the events below as it is in Axe&#39;s  camera, but for the moment, so is Axe. That first panel fails to inform  us whether the narrative is in its Chadian frame or East Timor, and the  second one only provides visual clues as to when and where we are.  Moreover, the perspective Axe and, through him, the reader has on that  helicopter is <a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/olinuris/ref/helicopter.jpg">a familiar and unpleasant one</a>: the isolation of the helicopter somehow representing both imperialist ambitions <em>and</em> the sinking feeling in a soldier&#39;s gut as his last connection to a life  outside of war pulls into the sky. In fact, this framing of the  conflict occurs throughout the chapter on East Timor, neatly paralleling  the fact that Axe feels like he learned little in the two weeks he  spent there.</p>
<p>*If I seem excessively focused on the personal or confessional aspects of the narrative, it&#39;s likely because I&#39;m working on <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/07/fall-comics-courses-american-manga-and-coming-of-age.html">my lesson plans</a> at the moment, and <em>War Is Boring</em> slots in nicely with the theme of &quot;Confessional Comics.&quot; Reading it in conjunction with Craig Thompson&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1891830430/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Blankets</em></a>,  the content of which could hardly be more different, makes plain one of  Axe&#39;s strengths as a novelist: his willingness to depict his  self-important or oblivious behavior, as in the &quot;Detroit&quot; chapter,  bolsters his credibility throughout.</p>

This looks, based on these few panels, a lot like a Sacco clone to me.  Any idea of whether that&#39;s true?  Sacco not only does the &quot;depict his self-important or oblivious behavior&quot; thing, he overdoes it, giving me as a reader the sense that his self-dislike is a mask rather than a credibility booster.  Of course, I&#39;d probably be even more suspicious of something that looked like it was supposed to be a credibility booster.</p></span>

(And I already had a Sacco comparison worked in, so you&#39;re not seeing nothing there.)</p></span>

(Know how you can tell? Because I can post here and write this and he can't.)</span></a></div>

All well and good. However, the reason Meyers disagrees with Ebert? Yet I have to wonder if the physical and mental trauma Roger has endured has taken a toll on his mind … Is it because the anger he must have concerning his condition is being projected onto the Right? After all, [Ebert's blog at the Sun Times] started after all the physical damage had been done to his appearance … Okay, so thus far it can be chalked up to the usual debate style of the Left. But here’s what concerns me about his state of mind … I don’t care what his political beliefs are, ultimately. I care about his mental faculties, and how he is undermining his own legacy as one of cinema’s great champions. I really wish he would return to the balcony. This is, I believe, a new conservative tactic: “I disagree with the partisan pollster you agree with, but instead of acknowledging that the obverse is also true, I will assume that during your struggle with thyroid cancer and the seven painful, but ultimately unsuccessful, surgeries to restore the ability to eat, drink and speak that followed—I’ll assume that somewhere in there you lost your mind and I’ll just mourn your death now, so can you please shut the fuck up already?” Seriously, that last line about “return[ing] the balcony” sounds like nothing so much as a former slave-owner longing for the days before all his former charges had the right to say whatever they damned well pleased. Meyers is annoyed because Ebert’s expressing the opinions he’s always held, but is blaming Ebert for his own inability to separate the body of work from the man who produced it. I wonder how he feels about Faulkner, whose politics he would (I hope) disavow as adamantly as he does Ebert’s? UPDATE: Crap! Meyers is absolutely correct, or so I must assume because, like Ebert, I'm in no position to judge. I apologize in advance for the misunderstanding.</span></a></div>
