nonspecialists reading the private correspondence of experts is that
their ignorance transforms all the technical points into nefarious
inkblots. To continue with the example above, skeptical nonspecialists
encounter the word &quot;trick&quot; and ask for clarification. Schmidt provides
evidence that the word is innocuous, but because nonspecialists can
interpret neither the context of the original nor that of the further
examples, they redouble their efforts: now the rhetorical situation in
which the word &quot;trick&quot; is uttered matters; now the appearance of
quotation marks matters, etc. They are convincing themselves that those
black blobs represent what they insist they represent, and when experts
inform them that those are not Rorschach blots to be subjectively
interpreted—that they are, in fact, <em>statements written in a language that skeptics simply do not understand</em>—the nonspecialists look over them again and declare that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rorschach_blot_01.jpg">it could be a butterfly, or maybe a bat</a>.<br /><br />To
my mind, the only way to convince them that the word &quot;trick&quot; operates
innocuously in the particular linguistic community of climate
scientists would be to demonstrate that the word &quot;trick&quot; operates
innocuously in the particular linguistic community of climate
scientists. Show the skeptics that on 11 July 2001, Jean-Charles
Hourcade <a href="http://www.anelegantchaos.org/cru/emails.php?eid=240&amp;filename=994859893.txt">wrote</a>:<br /><blockquote>This
passes first through ... a macroeconomic framework insuring the
consistency between prices and quantities at any point in time without
necessarily resorting to the modeling tricks relying on the
conventional neo-classical growth theory; these &#39;tricks&#39; assume indeed
perfect foresight, efficient markets and the absence of strategic or
routine behaviours; new conceptual frameworks about endogenous growth
theory allow for such a move, but there is a gap between advances in
pure theory and empirical modeling[.]</blockquote>I don&#39;t know what
that means any more than I know the science behind Phil Jones&#39;s
statement, but I do know that this email demonstrates that the word
&quot;trick&quot; is used both with and without quotation marks in this
particular language community. Moreover, I know that even though the
information leaked was designed to be do maximal damage to that
community, there is still evidence internal to it that resists attempts
to mischaracterize the intent of its members. Should skeptics insist
that &quot;trick&quot; doesn&#39;t mean a quick-and-dirty way to explore some
possibility, show them that on 12 January 2008, John Lanzante <a href="http://www.anelegantchaos.org/cru/emails.php?eid=852&amp;filename=1200162026.txt">noted</a> that<br /><blockquote>a
quick-and-dirty way to explore this possibility using a &quot;trick&quot; used
with precipitation data is to apply a square root transformation to the
rejection rates, average these, then reverse transform the average. The
square root transformation should yield data that is more nearly
Gaussian than the untransformed data.</blockquote>If, by some miracle, that satisfies them on the matter of &quot;tricks,&quot; they will <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/11/20/do-hacked-e-mails-show-global-warming-fraud/">start complaining</a> about the phrase &quot;hide the decline,&quot; which was, of course, the real object of their objection in the first place.<br /><br />Needless to say, I don&#39;t envy climate scientists the tsunami of stupid they&#39;re about to suffer.

The Second Amendment was supposed to ensure a Swiss style military system with a small professional army and a large civilian defence force.</p>

<p>So, no surprise whatsoever.</p></span>

The emphasis is mine: PALIN: With Israel, we cannot get into Israel, for instance, and say we're going to tell you whether the Jewish community can expand or not expand within your borders. Instead, what we need to do is tell Israel that we will—we'll go to bat for them. O'REILLY: Well, what does that mean though? Look, say Israel, say Netanyahu says—calls you up and says, I'm bombing them, I'm bombing Iran, they're too close, I'm not going to let it happen. What do you say? You say go ahead, Netanyahu, go bomb them? What do you say? PALIN: Oh my gosh, any kind of war strike is the absolute last option. O'REILLY: All right, so you, you say no. PALIN: That anybody would … O'REILLY: But he's saying to you, you guys aren't going to be able to stop him. PALIN: That's why we cannot let the world get to the place that you're talking about right now. O'REILLY: Well, we're already there. PALIN: No, we're not. We're not quite there yet. There is still hope. But what we have to do is exert the pressure that America can put on our allies and on those who are not so friendly. O'REILLY: Obama says he's doing all that. PALIN: He's bowing to world leaders and I think any other president in our country … O'REILLY: Do you mean that literally, the Japanese emperor? PALIN: I mean that literally. O'REILLY: Do you think Obama's weak abroad? PALIN: I believe that his approach to diplomacy is not what history has shown us works. What works in my mind, reading the history book, is what Reagan did.As to the first embarrassment—her insistence that symbolic gestures are literal—all I can say is that I believe her. She honestly has no idea that she literalized a cliché and then condemned Obama on account of it. She honestly believes that Obama can no longer exert political pressure on reluctant allies because he bowed to the Japanese emperor. She sees not symbolism but causality there. That symbolic gesture is literal proof that Obama is not &quot;exert[ing] the pressure that America can put on our allies and on those who are not so friendly.&quot; The mind boggles. As to the second embarrassment—her belief that there is one history book and it conforms to her ideological predisposition—that is the sort of statement only uttered by people who never read books.* I'm not making a judgment here: I'm saying that the locution &quot;reading the history book&quot; is grammatically foreign to anyone who has read more than one book.** If you ask anyone who regularly reads any question at all that requires reference to a source, you would receive a response that indicated an engagement with a scholarly community. It might be vague (&quot;some have argued&quot;), or it might indicate ignorance of the larger conversation (&quot;the...</span></a></div>

(Had his Species: the History of an Idea and Defining Species: a Sourcebook from Antiquity to Today been available in 2002, I could've avoided years of thankless legwork and finished my dissertation with normative time to spare. Not that I'm bitter.) So I can think of no better way to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the publication of the Origin than to listen to Wilkins speculate about what would have happened had it never existed. My only qualm is with this paragraph:Lamarckism, by which I mean the progressivist view of evolution, not the “acquired inheritance” version that has little to do directly with Lamarck and anyway is set up as a contrast with Weismann not Darwin, would have played an even greater role in people’s thinking than it did. It may still be with us now—we would be trying to figure out how progress occurs out of necessity, rather than it being the rather odd view of people like Conway Morris.I think scholars who focus more on the scientific literature underestimate the popular appeal of what amounts to quasi-Lamarckian thought both then and now ... but then again, as I'm the person who wrote my dissertation, I would.</span></a></div>
