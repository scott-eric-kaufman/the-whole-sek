I walked over to the Cashier's Office. I snaked through the Cashier's line. I questioned the teller about the status of my account. The teller pursed her lips at her monitor and asked me whether I paid my fees on time. I said I had. She asked whether I'd mailed them or handed them to a teller. I said I'd handed them to a teller. She asked whether the check I'd written had been cashed. I said it had. She excused herself for a moment. The teller had excused herself for more than a moment. Much more. I waited. Tapped my fingers. Pulled my ear. Fiddled with buttons. Ten minutes went by. I leaned over the partition. Looked around. Leaned back. Tapped fingers. Ten more minutes passed. I huffed audibly. Crossed my arms. Scowled. That did the trick. The teller returned and said: &quot;Did you pay a library fine the same day?&quot; I said that I had. &quot;How much was it for?&quot; I said how much it was for. &quot;Because the library applied all the funds you deposited that day to the overdue fee.&quot; &quot;They did?&quot; &quot;They did.&quot; &quot;Why'd they do that?&quot; &quot;They don't know.&quot; &quot;Will they undo it?&quot; &quot;They said they'll try.&quot; &quot;They said they'll try to refund the $2,640 they applied to a $12.50 overdue fee?&quot; &quot;That's what they said.&quot; &quot;Did they indicate whether they thought they'd be successful?&quot; &quot;They didn't say.&quot; &quot;Did they say what I should do if they weren't successful?&quot; &quot;They didn't say.&quot; &quot;But they did say they'd try to refund the $2,640 they applied to a $12.50 overdue fee?&quot; &quot;That's what they said.&quot; &quot;Did they happen to tell say when they'd try to refund the $2,640 they applied to a $12.50 overdue fee?&quot; &quot;They said because they assessed the fine last month the money's already been reallocated—&quot; &quot;Can they allocate it back?&quot; &quot;They said it's not that simple.

			<p>Three weeks ago Friday I went to the UCI Cashier&#39;s Office to settle two outstanding debts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Overdue Library Fine: $12.50</li>
<li>Fall Student Fees: $2,640.00</li>
</ul>

<p>I wrote the UC Regents a check, snaked through the Cashier&#39;s line and handed the check to the teller.&#0160; She smiled and chirped: </p>

<p>&quot;Have a great weekend!&quot; </p>

<p>So you can imagine my surprise when I went to register for the Fall Quarter and learned from the Registrar that I
hadn&#39;t paid my Student Fees.&#0160; I walked over to the Cashier&#39;s Office.&#0160; I snaked through the Cashier&#39;s line.&#0160; I questioned the teller about the status of my account.</p>

<p>The teller pursed her lips at her monitor and asked me
whether I paid my fees on time.&#0160; </p>

<p>I said I had.&#0160; </p>

<p>She asked whether I&#39;d mailed
them or handed them to a teller.&#0160; </p>

<p>I said I&#39;d handed them to a teller.</p>

<p>She
asked whether the check I&#39;d written had been cashed.&#0160; </p>

<p>I said it had.&#0160; </p>

<p>She excused herself for a moment. </p>

<p>The teller had excused herself for more than a moment.&#0160; Much more.</p>

<p>I waited.&#0160; </p>

<p>Tapped my fingers.&#0160; Pulled my ear.&#0160; Fiddled with buttons.&#0160; </p>

<p>Ten minutes went by.&#0160; </p>

<p>I leaned over the partition.&#0160; Looked around.&#0160; Leaned back.&#0160; Tapped fingers.&#0160; </p>

<p>Ten more minutes passed.&#0160; </p>

<p>I huffed audibly.&#0160; Crossed my arms.&#0160; Scowled.&#0160; </p>

<p>That did the trick.&#0160; The teller returned and said:</p>

<p>&quot;Did you pay a library fine the same day?&quot;</p>

<p>I said that I had.&#0160; </p>

<p>&quot;How much was it for?&quot;</p>

<p>I said how much it was for.</p>

<p>&quot;Because the library applied&#0160; all the funds you deposited that day to the overdue fee.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They did?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why&#39;d they do that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will they undo it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They said they&#39;ll try.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They said they&#39;ll <em>try </em>to refund the $2,640 they applied to a $12.50 overdue fee?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s what they said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did they indicate whether they thought they&#39;d be successful?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They didn&#39;t say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did they say what I should do if they weren&#39;t successful?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They didn&#39;t say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But they <em>did</em> say they&#39;d try to refund the $2,640 they applied to a $12.50 overdue fee?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s what they said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did they happen to tell say <em>when</em> they&#39;d try to refund the $2,640 they applied to a $12.50 overdue fee?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They said because they assessed the fine last month the money&#39;s already been reallocated—&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can they allocate it back?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They said it&#39;s not that simple.&#0160; In the meantime, why don&#39;t you pay your student fees now and work out this situation with the library later?&quot;</p>

<p>I looked at her as only a man without $2,640 in his wallet looks at a teller who assumes he does.&#0160; (For reference: a subtle variation of &quot;You Must Be Fucking Kidding Me.&quot;)&#0160; I continued staring until she looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&quot;If you pay your student fees now you can work out the library situation later.&quot;</p>

<p>I stared some more.&#0160; </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;d be happy to help you process your student fees.&quot;</p>



<p>The staring evolved into glowering around the words &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;help.&quot;&#0160; I was determined to remain mute until she presented cartoonish symptoms of discomfort.&#0160; I wanted to see the color rise to her face.&#0160; I wanted to watch an exaggerated tug of her collar.&#0160; I wanted to hear a gulp audible across the room.&#0160; I wanted to—</p>

<p>&quot;Do you not have the money right now?&#0160; Because you can&#39;t register for courses until your fees are paid.&quot;</p>

<p>I wanted to leave the Cashier&#39;s Office without saying another word.&#0160; </p>

<p>I nodded and headed to the door.&#0160; At my retreating frame she yelled:</p>

<p>&quot;Have a great weekend!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s off to a wonderful start.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You sure can say that again!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m sure <em>you </em>can.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I sure can!&quot;</p>

		<span id="comment-87190206-content"><p>You see, this is your purpose in the universe, Scott.  When something minor and bad happens, I can think &quot;At least I didn&#39;t get cancer!  At least I didn&#39;t get hit by a car!  At least I didn&#39;t have students try to have sex in my office and then write about it and get embroiled in a sexual harassment office foulup!  At least I don&#39;t have Internet nuts periodically threaten me!&quot;</p>

<p>(Why don&#39;t I have Internet nuts threaten me?  I never have.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because as a commenter I&#39;m not worth it, because I carefully try to never taunt people who seem like actual crazy people, or because I seem more bellicose.)</p>

<p>At any rate, it appears that this perhaps God-given purpose will at least preserve you into a ripe old age.  You will have to be around so that when you&#39;re 80, your hearing aid will fall out, be accidentally flushed down the toilet, and you&#39;ll be unable to immediately get a new one because the government will only supply you with one if you order one personally by phone.  Or maybe the Singularity will occur, you&#39;ll be in a simulation 1000 years from now, and your hearing aid will fall out, be accidentally flushed down the simulated toilet, and the simulated government etc.</p>

<p>If nothing else suggests itself, I will go ahead and lend you the money, on the assumption that they&#39;re going to have to refund it sooner or later.  I&#39;d hate to see what else fate will come up with if I don&#39;t.</p>

<p>But why are you taking classes?  Aren&#39;t you done with them?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-87191778-content"><p>I appreciate the offer, Rich, but I fully intend on taking care of this tomorrow morning.  I will not let the library eat my money.  Libraries ought to know better.  Mine, it seems, prefers to misbehave.</p>

<p>The &quot;classes&quot; in question are &quot;dissertation hours.&quot;  But because I was on leave last year, I need to sign up (and pay) for 12 units.  </p>

<p>But yes, I&#39;m a veritable ... Stephen White?  By which I mean, the person to whom men-with-thistle-down-hair do improbably terrible things.  (As opposed to something racist.)</p>

<p>As to when I&#39;ll lose my hearing aids: it&#39;ll have to be sometime after I start wearing them.  I know I should, but prefer my quiet world to the noisome, loathsome cacophony in which you poor saps live.</p></span>

<p>I honestly can&#39;t imagine putting that book down once it&#39;s picked up, but then it was a haunting experience for me: very nearly the perfect melding of fantasy and history, complete with footnotes!</p>

<p>As for the fiscal situation: you were very restrained. My inclination would have been to find out who was the financial person at the library and stand over their desk until they &quot;found&quot; a solution....</p></span>

<p>as per the topic of this conversation, the fact that unitiversities here are so blatant in their different charges, fees and etc is something i am yet to get used to: &quot;what&#39;s that $75 for again?&quot; - &quot;technology fee&quot; - &quot;how about this $35?&quot; - &quot;library fee&quot; - &quot;but i thought most of the &#39;technology&#39; was in the library anyway? can i give you, say, $50 and we will call it even?&quot; i think students would riot in Russia if they were charged stuff like that, there they just include it all in tuition... but then again if i really don&#39;t like it here so much why don&#39;t i just go back where i came from, right? </p></span>

<p>This reminds me of peculiarity at my old university.  They stipulated that we sign up for classes no matter whether our financial aid was worked out.  One semester I waited until the first first or second day of classes to sign up because it took that long for the F.A. office to figure out my aid.  Anyway, I was assessed a $50 late fee for, as I saw it, being responsible.  Of course I contested the fee, sending e-mail after e-mail up the chain, eventually writing the president&#39;s office.  After a few days my e-mail was answered by a jack-ass provost who said: &quot;Just pay the $50 and get back to work on your dissertation.&quot;  It was a two sentence e-mail.  He was a jerk, but I had no choice. </p>

<p>Of course my situation doesn&#39;t apply to you at all.  Your post, however, recalled my mishaps and pratfalls with administrators. - TL</p></span>

		<span id="comment-87281570-content"><p>After spending four hours running back-and-forth between Grad Studies, Financial Services, the Registrar, &amp;c. I have found the problem:</p>

<p>The library charged me a $4,545 overdue fee on Charmain London&#39;s <em>The Book of Jack London</em>.  No one knows why they did this -- the book&#39;s not rare, not lost, and more to the point, not overdue -- so they think there may&#39;ve be a clerical error.  Problem is, they can&#39;t find the money: everyone says it should be in someone else&#39;s payables.  </p>

<p>But everyone assures me they <em>will</em> find the money (and not charge me late fees for all the late things this situation created).  </p>

<p>Gads, but does this suck.</p></span>

I recommend them. I pen this odd post because I've been busy all day and had to respond to them thus. (Pressing deadlines do no wonders for casual conversation.) I wouldn't normally alert anyone to the fact that His Highness has commented on His own post, but this comment's been bothering me: I think this speaks to a your vision of your blog as more than a platform from which you can declaim. Not because it's unfair, mind you, but because I've been rather hands-off lately. I'm in blogging-as-therapy mode—in which writing calms the mind by allowing it to wander into sillier pastures and write this thing called fun—and blogging-as-therapy entails me stopping work on the dissertation, writing something salutary, then shutting down the laptop. This is something I need to work on. Maybe I shouldn't post when I know I lack the energy to comment ... but then what about my therapy? It bothers me when bloggers don't respond to comments, because I envision blogging to be more conversation than bully pulpit. (And I mean &quot;envision&quot; there. I'm talking full-bore grandiose wish-casting. Such is the stuff of my envisionings.) But without the blogger contributing to the conversation, it starts to seem like an abuse of the conversational ethos. This must change. Things must be done. They will be ... but not tonight.</span></a></div>
