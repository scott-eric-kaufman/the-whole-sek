		<span id="comment-78410970-content"><p>Autism related stuff tends to be really spectrum-y so a lot of factors combine together to produce the effects of it.  So quite a few of the factors can be true for you and effect your life without them combining like voltron into an autistic lion.  Also, many of the lower level symptoms are similar to the symptoms of other issues, many of which are non-medical.  Serious academics tend to be detail oriented and relatively asocial, etc.  This raises a kind of chicken-or-the-egg question:  did my academic career instill these things in me or did I find academia a comfortable place because I was already that way?</p>

<p>For me, it&#39;s probably a little of both.  I&#39;ve been pretty asocial from day one.  I have a pretty keen social intuition as far as reading people goes(definitely not an aspergers symptom) but for me this never really translated into a strong intuition as to what behavior would be appropriate on my part.  I know the social protocols, I just have to think about them consciously.  So social situations around people I don&#39;t know very well are very stressful for me because I&#39;m &quot;processing&quot; the whole time and so talking to strangers is kind of like taking the SAT (this IS an HFA symptom.)<br />
Also, I&#39;ve always been all kinds of ADD (not really any H though) and so that complicates things.  ADD is another one of those things where there are a lot of factors that we don&#39;t understand and many of them overlap with other things (as per that discussion you linked to.)  Some of the factors overlap with autism spectrum disorders, and interestingly, the strong habits I&#39;ve developed to cope with my ADD push my behavior a little more towards the autism spectrum.  To combat distraction, I&#39;ve done the following things:  cut quite a bit of what I don&#39;t have to concentrate on out of my life, learned to value finishing things to an extreme degree and learned to trigger hyperfocus on anything which presents a problem to me.<br />
 <br />
Being an scholarly type has probably exacerbated these symptoms noticeably.  First, a tendency to hyperfocus is a common ADD symptom but it&#39;s only become a big part of my daily life as I&#39;ve gotten more and more serious about scholarship. Secondly, my social skills have been affected somewhat because I spend nearly all my time concentrating on things which cannot be easily summed up for polite conversation and so my ability to communicate with people who are not my friends has diminished.</p>

<p>So I can imagine that variations on this scenario are common in certain ways.  &quot;Nerdy&quot; disciplines are natural places for people who already display a few of the attributes shared by Aspergers or HFA types and those very attributes can in some ways be brought out by the demands of the discipline.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-78414598-content"><p>Jake, I think people-obsessed people are disqualified on the people front, which is one of the reasons I found my score so high: I <em>am</em>, in fact, <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/01/reflections_on_.html" rel="nofollow">people</a> tend to like me, and I can move smoothly between different social circles.  I&#39;m as comfortable shooting the shit about sports as I am slagging Lacan, and can shift between the two with frightening speed.  (Only in certain company,  as when Kugelmass comes over.)  The thing is, I simply prefer <em>not</em> to socialize at this point in my life.  (Except online, that is.)  The very thought of showering, shaving, getting a haircut, dressing reasonably, leaving the house, &amp;c. exhausts me, so I very rarely do it.  I think J.S. Nelson&#39;s notion of a constellation of symptoms becoming a reasonable approximation of Asperger is probably responsible for my result.  (Not that I&#39;ve expended much energy thinking about it.)</p>

<p>J.S. Nelson, I&#39;m on board the ADD-taught-me-how-to-concentrate train.  I was diagnosed the end of my senior year of high school.  I graduated with a 1.7 GPA, then went on to earn on B my entire college career.  Amazing how the mere acknowledgment of the problem changes everything; I mean, once I learned I had something to cope with, life suddenly made much more sense.  </p>

<p>Along the same chicken-egg line you draw above, I&#39;d put this question: if you took a normal person, told them they had ADD and treated them accordingly, would they become more academic, or merely pay more attention to video games?  Would they play different video games, tiring of <em>Guitar Hero</em> and moving to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</em>, then from there to <em>Civilization</em>?  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-78421692-content"><p>It depends on the person and what treating them accordingly means.  Presuming you could convince someone that they did, it would depend on their motivations.<br />
There are two ways you can use the knowledge that you have ADD.  You can use it as a diagnosis and move on to a kind of &quot;treatment&quot; IE developing skills and habits to minimize the damage done and capitalize on the strengths (or medication, which has pretty different effects on non-ADD people).  If a normal person tried this they might see some improvement, but I think they might figure out they don&#39;t have ADD when they don&#39;t come up against much resistance.<br />
The other way you can use it is as an excuse for indulging in any behavior typically associated with ADD people.  Unfortunately, I suspect that this one would be more likely, especially if the person is not actually faced with the real problems associated with ADD.</p>

<p>I had a kind of &quot;scared straight&quot;/Good Will Hunting experience as far as this sort of thing goes.  They caught my ADD pretty early, put me on medication and even moved me to a montessori middle through high school which purported to be a better environment for me.  The problem was my parents and teachers had a really &quot;neurodiverse&quot; attitude toward me so basically I was just taught that I was different and that it was unfortunate that the world didn&#39;t better accommodate my differences.<br />
Long story short, I embraced my differences, became an anarchist, did drugs, read philosophy instead of doing homework, dropped out of high school, etc.<br />
Then I got a job as a construction worker for a while, and the guy who I worked for had essentially the same story as me:  smart guy, liked philosophy, dropped out because he didn&#39;t want to deal with The Man.  Now he&#39;s 60 and builds rich people&#39;s houses.<br />
So I rocked the SATs and went back to school.  Thinking for a living is more fun long term than operating a chipping hammer.</p></span>

The answer, I think, is that earworms are a product of intonation. Someone says or sings something compellingly, and it echoes around your skull for the next couple of hours/days/weeks/months/years. For example: Someone who's attended all the Mets-Brewers games at Milwaukee's Miller Park and sits somewhere near the Fox Sports Net Wisconsin stadium microphone keeps yelling the same nonsensical phrase ... and now it's stuck in my head: Announcer #1: And Reyes steps to the plate. Announcer #2: This kid is fast. I'm talking, the most exciting player in baseball. Random Fan Near Stadium Microphone: THERE IS A HOLE! Announcer #1: First pitch to Reyes is a ball. Random Fan Near Stadium Microphone: IN THE SKY! Announcer #2: He wants to set Reyes up with a change away. Random Fan Near Stadium Microphone: THERE IS A HOLE! Announcer #1: That's in there for a strike. Random Fan Near Stadium Microphone: IN THE SKY! I know, I know. There's a hole in the sky. I got it. The way this random fan chants is almost melodic, like Yeats reading &quot;Innisfree,&quot; and wouldn't you know it, I find myself near-humming his insanity now. Between sentences both written and read, there's now a hole, in the sky. Any more of this and those who think I lost it earlier will be proven correct.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/in-the-comments.html"><span><strong>Leonard Cohen's &quot;How to Speak Poetry,&quot; How He Spoke Poetry, and How Poetry Shouldn't Be Spoken</strong> In the comments to Ogged's post on Ezra Pound, DS links to something I once spent years looking for: Leonard Cohen's prose-poem &quot;How to Speak Poetry.&quot; Of course, Google returns thirty copies of it, mocking my then-futile search to acquire a copy of the collection it's from, Death of a Lady's Man (1979). (Not to be confused with his 1978 collaboration with Phil Spector, Death of a Ladies' Man. I love the humility of the book's singular.) All of the copies online (until now) contain the same typos and odd paragraph breaks, which nicely parallels the copy I found in 1995: hand-written, riddled with misspellings, and slightly altered to apply to one local poet in particular. So I clean it up the copy I found on Google with some reservation. You can read the whole thing at the link above, but for my current purposes, a few excerpts will suffice: The word butterfly is merely data. It is not an opportunity for you to hover, soar, befriend flowers, symbolize beauty and frailty, or in any way impersonate a butterfly. Do not act out words. Never act out words. Never try to leave the floor when you talk about flying. Never close your eyes and jerk your head to one side when you talk about death. Do not fix your burning eyes on me when you speak about love. Sound advice, since most poets are poets, not actors—only, some poets are actors. For the second time in three days, I'll link to &quot;Innisfree.&quot; Does Cohen want to deprive the world of Yeats' oracular chanting? Speak the words with the exact precision with which you would check out a laundry list. Do not become emotional about the lace blouse. Do not get a hard-on when you say panties. Do not get all shivery just because of the towel. The sheets should not provoke a dreamy expression about the eyes. There is no need to weep into the handkerchief. The socks are not there to remind you of strange and distant voyages. It is just your laundry. It is just your clothes. Don't peep through them. Just wear them. No. Cohen can brook the performance of poetry, he simply has no patience for poets whose performance consists of a pale representation of their poems: &quot;The word butterfly is not a real butterfly.&quot; Cohen rails against the obviousness of reference, against the poet who shoots his audience a seductive look when he speaks of seduction, who mistakes the words for what they represent. His dictum against the obviousness of reference extends to the obviousness of response: &quot;Do not get a hard-on when you say panties.&quot; Inspiring the audience to erection is the point, otherwise the performance degrades into expression—another uninteresting whinge about which no one beside the poet cares. Anyone who listens to Cohen must choose which Cohen performs &quot;How to Speak Poetry&quot; in his or her head. Will it be the thin, flat voice of the '60s and '70s or the gruff majesty...</span></a></div>
