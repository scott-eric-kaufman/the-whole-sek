<p>The more I talk to (current and former) graduate students outside my
department, the more I realize how variable the graduate school
experience can be.&nbsp; Like yours, my graduate experience is singular,
determined by the temperament of my advisor and committee.&nbsp; The more I
listen, the more I hear of expectations utterly foreign to my
experience.&nbsp; For example, is it common for advisors to expect weekly
updates about what one has read and written?&nbsp; I could easily produce
documentation of the sort.&nbsp; To wit:
</p>
<blockquote><p>This week, I consolidated my thought on <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/all_in_all_a_de.html">the American reception and appropriation of English Romanticism</a>, thought long and hard about <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/12/longer_than_i_d.html">how to frame my argument historically</a>, considered the influence of <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/12/dissertation_ni.html">certain exceedingly popular characters</a> on the American literary marketplace, and shored up my argument about the significance of <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/12/multiple_choice.html">the Spanish-American-Cuban-Filipino War</a> in <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/12/archival_fun_no.html">the average American’s daily life</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>As you can see, I have no problem producing such an accounting—but
as the attendant links indicate, anyone who wants such information need
only consult my blog.&nbsp; I may not diarize it in neat vignettes, but
anyone who wishes to can infer the arc of my research from what I
publish online.&nbsp; They may not know exactly why I’m reading or thinking
through or writing about what I’m reading, thinking through or writing
about, but it <em>is</em> obvious that I’m not wasting my days futzing around and drinking my nights away, right?&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
If my committee wants tabs on me, I provide prose enough to keep them
close.&nbsp; But maybe I should be more proactive?&nbsp; Maybe I should document
and email every <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/curveball.html">curve the archive hurls</a>, play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_Sports_Bureau">Elias Sports</a> to my own dissertation—but (<em>he says, blithely shifting metaphors</em>)
I fear a ticker scrolling SEKCH3 -0.07/-0.39% or somesuch every
Saturday morning would compel my committee to raise arms against me.
</p>
<p>So what, in your experience, do advisors and committees expect of
graduate students?&nbsp; I know such things are variable in the extreme, so
if you could recount—anonymously if necessary—what was expected of you
or what you expect of your graduate students in this regard, I would
appreciate it.&nbsp; After all, how can <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/another_mla_pan.html">I talk about professionalization generally</a> if I’m only able to speak to my own?

		<span id="comment-26484251-content"><p>Obviously, it varies widely. But a suggestion for all the future dissertators out there: it makes a lot of sense to include (if possible) both illustrious full profs AND lowly but eager assistant profs on your committee, as you need the guidance and perspective (and letters) of the former, but the latter will likely be far more willing to sit down with you and actually go over stuff. If this is not legally possible at your department (can&#39;t have assistant profs on committees etc) at least make very good friends with one of the noob profs who lives in the basement (or wherever...) </p>

<p>Sadly, I did not do this. I mean, I had a committee to die for in many ways, and I&#39;m definitely not complaining. But I should have sidled up to an assistant prof who could&#39;ve shown me the ropes a bit. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-26485216-content"><p>Australia technically doesn&#39;t use a committee system (although I&#39;ve constructed one informally anyway - I obviously have difficulty absorbing some of the ways that graduate study here differs from study in the US).  So, primarily, students work very closely with one main supervisor, with perhaps a second on a more tangential basis.  Supervisors don&#39;t mark the dissertation - that&#39;s done externally, along the lines of a peer review process...  This doesn&#39;t change the essence of the supervisory process much, although it makes things somewhat easier to navigate for students whose work doesn&#39;t fall into established disciplinary boundaries...</p>

<p>Since, via the research methods teaching, I work with a lot of PhD students trying to select supervisors (or flee them, once things have gone wrong), I can confirm that the supervisory experience can vary radically - I&#39;m slowly learning to steer students to supervisors based on temperamental matches, as well as substantive expertise...  </p>

<p>My own supervisory team is very, very laid back, but this is because it makes me nervous if I feel I have to report on a regular basis, so I&#39;ve selected supervisors accordinly.  My blog is, in a sense, part of the social compact that buys me this latitude:  they can always spy on what I&#39;m doing there - I conceal only my most egregious outbursts of procrastination...  ;-P</p>

<p>My initial supervisor didn&#39;t like this approach: he would refuse to read the blog, and then complain that he had no idea what I was doing.  Even when I printed out things from the blog and left them in his box, he wouldn&#39;t read them because, apparently, as blog products they were a priori not serious enough to be relevant to my work...  ;-P</p>

<p>My sense is that my current supervisors also rarely look in - if I want specific feedback, I send around a URL, and someone will usually take a peek.  I also email around periodic updates on where I am against my timeline, and any writing on which I want feedback.  This is solely at my initiative, however, and I never actually receive any feedback on my writing...  </p>

<p>Some of this is intrinsic - I&#39;ve worked as a copyeditor (not that you could tell from my online posts... ;-P), I write on topics people find hard to understand, and I think there&#39;s a general sense that people aren&#39;t really sure how exactly to contribute along the way...  I think I&#39;m meant to take this as some sort of extra-strong expression of confidence in what I&#39;m doing, but I have this terror that we&#39;ll get to the end of the process, they&#39;ll see the final draft, and go - &quot;This?  *This* was what you were writing all this time?&quot;</p>

<p>That said, I prefer this to the micro-management or formal reporting styles of other supervisors - and I&#39;ve organised my informal committee so that I can get a range of feedback as I need it, even if this means reaching beyond my official supervisory team...</p></span>

		<span id="comment-26490674-content"><p>Postgraduates in the UK do not generally have research committees, although I sense that this is starting to change, with more and more PhD students being assigned two or more supervisors, who can provide the crucial, sparkling &quot;end of year&quot; reports to funding bodies.</p>

<p>For myself, however, I have not yet been put under such pressure. Quite the opposite. My supervisor is effectively non-existent, until I have either a technical question or want her to read over a chapter. Then she hurls at me a hundred brilliant and tangential ideas, which encourage me to go away and rewrite what I had written. So I suppose this too has its downside. If I was being supervised on a weekly basis, I imagine feedback on my work would take the form of regular, corrective nudges. As it is, I end up producing what I think of as a polished essay every couple of months, and then, having struggled to get it to such a state, I then have to take it extensively apart in the light of whatever new thoughts my supervisor has contributed. My supervisor is the biggest pain in my literary ass...and my work is all the better for it.</p></span>

<blockquote>But I should have sidled up to an assistant prof who could&#39;ve shown me the ropes a bit.</blockquote>

<p>Isn&#39;t this what blogging&#39;s for?</p>

<p>N.P.:</p>

<blockquote>Even when I printed out things from the blog and left them in his box, he wouldn&#39;t read them because, apparently, as blog products they were a priori not serious enough to be relevant to my work...</blockquote>

<p>The idea of printing out a post and handing it to a professor strikes me as, well, <i>INSANITY!</i>  I didn&#39;t even tell my advisor I blogged; he found out from my illustrious co-blogger, Sean McCann, a close friend of his from graduate school.  Then I had to justify why it wasn&#39;t a complete waste of time (my experience at last year&#39;s MLA helped immensely).</p>

<p>Ishmael:</p>

<blockquote>As it is, I end up producing what I think of as a polished essay every couple of months...</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve almost abandoned the notion of producing &quot;polished&quot; work.  The more I learn about the ins and outs of academic publishing, the less I value the effort put into polishing...at least, that&#39;s what I <i>should</i> do.  Sadly, I spend an inordinate amount of time polishing prose I&#39;m almost certain will be cut by one of my committee members, because writing <i>is</i> a craft, in the end.</p></span>

I&#39;ve never hidden the blog from anyone at my university (and, of course, I&#39;ve never been anonymous, although it took slightly more effort during the blog&#39;s first six months for someone to find my name) - and I do sometimes write quite serious theoretical posts, sections of things intended eventually to be published, etc.  For me, periodically asking faculty to look at pieces of the blog is actually a way of explaining why it <em>isn&#39;t</em> a huge waste of my time - I generally have a much easier time once they&#39;ve actually looked at the thing...</p>

<p>I have to admit, I&#39;ve also used the blog as a means of undermining a particular kind of image of me that people seem to get in person - what can I say?  I find the impressions I make in person annoying, and enjoy the opportunity for a bit of self-sabotage in favour of an image closer to how I view myself...  ;-P</p></span>

<p>I&#39;m really quite new at this, having just completed my first quarter of grad school.  Classes are once a week, which is convenient because it frees up more time for reading and staring listlessly into space, but also frustrating because I have very little structured time with my classmates, many of whom are aspiring alcoholics.</p>

<p>Blogging, I&#39;ve found, is far more popular among grad students in the later stages of their programs.  Newbies like me simply don&#39;t (or at least shouldn&#39;t) have time.  We&#39;re supposed to me immersing ourselves in dense, esoteric literature, not reading about Scott&#39;s adventures in dissertating.</p>

<p>Papers, it turns out, ought to be started by about week four or five of a ten week term.  Mine were started in week eight -- this I wouldn&#39;t recommend.  </p>

<p>Some students are unpretentious and approachable; others take themselves and their ideas very, very seriously and only feel comfortable talking shop.  </p></span>

However, I am currently on a postdoctoral fellowship and my supervisor asks me about “the state of my work” every two weeks. I admit I feel downright insulted! Last time, I told him that I was “reading books on the subject and doing a lot of reflection” (I only started in September!). I don&#39;t know what it is that he wants to hear... but I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s not what I&#39;m telling him.<br />
All this to say that 1) it never really ends, and 2) post-post-graduates generally blog about ANYTHING BUT their research. ;)<br />

At that meeting, the committee would decide upon a deadline for the submission of the second chapter, there would be a meeting. . . and then the committee was done. </p>

<p>My advisor and I met approximately once every two months, but sometimes three or four would go by without our seeing each other. I&#39;d drop her an email every so often (also about every two months) just to let her know what I&#39;d been up to, or to give her a sense of when she could expect the next draft, but that was as much for appearance&#39;s sake (see! I&#39;m on top of things!) as anything. She never gave me any deadlines for anything and I don&#39;t believe <i>she</i> ever contacted <i>me</i> to check on my progress.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-26616804-content"><p>I am in the throes of dissertating, which is why I am online commenting on people&#39;s blogs right now. (Side note: do you think blogging is helping your writing or providing a distraction/letting the writing pressure steam off? I would worry about the latter for me.)</p>

<p>Not only do advisor-dissertator relationships vary widely, they are vastly different even within a single department, so the profs I know have very different methods of checking in, offering mentoring, and the frequency of meeting with their students. We have one prof who takes her grads out to lunch once a quarter (!!!!) and also makes them drop by her office hours at least once a month. That sounds great but the downside is you can never work fast enough for her and her method of &quot;mentoring&quot; feels more like nagging to me. There&#39;s a couple profs in our department who are the polar opposite --- they expect to not see you unless you are turning in something, and it&#39;s impossible to find them to ask them questions, and they won&#39;t meet with you no matter how fast or slow you work. I thought my advisor was very hands off --- she sternly told me not to bring her anything but polished chapters (which she then proceeds to rip to shreds as if they were early drafts) and doesn&#39;t seem to require regular meetings or updates. But then I found out that she tracked down one of her students who was &quot;behind schedule&quot; and practically locked him in a room for a week until he turned in a chapter. Since she&#39;s never done that to me, I guess I must be &quot;on schedule.&quot; </p>

<p>One of the most frustrating things about grad school ABD (and to some extent before that) is that there seems to be very little in terms of hard and fast rules/deadlines/to-do lists to follow, from how to relate to committee members to how to prepare oneself for the job market, and yet it feels like there are many expectations, that no one will spell out explicitly, hanging over you in a big dread cloud. My friend said his qualifying exam felt like &quot;I&#39;m thinking of a color; what is it?&quot; and that to me sums up grad school.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-26781070-content"><p>I&#39;m currently a PhD student in Australia, but at a university that, unlike N Pepperell&#39;s above, does have a committee system.  All three of my committee members have offices within a few doors of mine, so we see each other on a daily basis.  Mostly we don&#39;t mention the dissertation :)</p>

<p>My main supervisor, however, expects pieces of writing every 3 weeks or so, and has done right from the start.  She doesn&#39;t like to read first drafts, though, and doesn&#39;t like to meet to talk about things unless she has read some work just before.  So we have this rhythm where she asks if I&#39;ve got any work for her, I make excuses and avoid her for a few weeks, then hand her something rough, then she avoids me for a couple of weeks to read it, and then we meet.  Then I have about two weeks&#39; grace before the cycle starts again.</p>

<p>I wish I knew a better way!</p>

<p>The official requirements of the university are meetings with the main supervisor at least every two weeks, meetings with the other two committee members &quot;regularly&quot;, a seminar once a year, an &quot;annual plan&quot; hammered out once a year (like a giant &quot;to do&quot; list), and a literature review completed by the end of the first year (the PhD in Australia is a three-year, research-only program).</p></span>

		<span id="comment-26869196-content"><p>I have to admit, I&#39;ve saved this entry in my rss-feed file, hoping to come back to it about now and find about twenty times the responses before I myself stuck my toe in the water.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been so demoralized by grad school -- specifically by the procedures, their lack of quality, and an almost total lack of guidance, as opposed to any real problem with my subject matter or a lack of fire in the belly -- that I&#39;m pretty happy to be left alone.  Whenever my adviser or a committee member tries to advise me on my dissertation, their concept of my topic and/or the writing process bears so little resemblance to what I&#39;m actually experiencing that it&#39;s deeply painful and disconcerting enough to get me tied up in knots, and therefore unproductive, all over again.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in grad school since 1998.</p>

<p>I think my adviser contacts me when she thinks about it.  I let her know about two weeks ago that I had a chapter ready to give her, and asked her how best to do that; so far, nothing back.  Once, I went an entire year without seeing her.  We were both in town.  At those extremes, the lack of contact kind of bothers me, but in general, I&#39;m <s>happy</s> happiest (which is to say, not in immediate need of sedation) to be left alone to sort out how to do this on my own.  This method is actually starting to work very well; I only hope my committee remembers me when I&#39;m done.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned the most about how to write a dissertation by teaching freshman writing courses, reading up on writing for them, going back to my notes on &quot;how to write a research paper&quot; from high school, and picking up the occasional good guide, like <i>How to Read a Book</i></p>

<p>[Paste Trystero49&#39;s last paragraph here, and add all that stuff about managing your work schedule and motivation under those conditions, and having no money or time.  Plus any personal things, like learning to deal with marriage or without, accidents and health issues that come out of nowhere, etc. etc.]</p></span>

I say &quot;failed,&quot; but it appears they stuck. After those, however, there's nothing. Four-percent here, three-percent there, but nothing to prevent someone passing off my work as their own. Obviously, I find this deeply unsettling...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/12/thisll_teach_me.html"><span><strong>This'll Teach me not to Read the Comments; or, That is my Reputation? Cue the Pet Shop Boys, Please</strong> I confess: I often read posts in Google Reader without clicking through to read the comments. Sometimes I don't even have time to read the posts and end a week with an imposing backlog. In December's haul, I encountered this Charlotte Street post. It contained a link to the (unread) comments to this earlier one, in which the world-renowned Deborah asks: Is this a post about Scott Eric Kaufman and The Valve? 'Cause boy, it sure fits like it. Mark responds with typical grace, but the comment still grates on my nerves. The post concerned imposture and academic charlatanry—a subject previously discussed at the now-defunct CPROBES—and the remarkable Deborah thinks me a prime example of both. Why? Because I've neither read nor thought seriously about Continental philosophy, generally, or Zizek, in particular. I'm positive the illustrious Deborah intended to be ironic there. No one with her sterling reputation would intentionally respond to a post about judging someone by reputation instead of a knowledge of their work by judging me on the basis of my reputation and not a knowledge of my work, right?</span></a></div>
