Seriously, I really think that using the blogs really helped my students become better writers and thinkers. When they had to face a real audience who constantly pushed them to see things from different viewpoints, they couldn&#39;t help but get out of their black and white thinking. Most of them. It&#39;s not a panacea, of course. The ones who took the audience seriously and wanted to influence that audience really pushed themselves to write well about interesting things.</p></span>

<p>I&#39;m very interested in seeing your article and would be glad to provide my 2 cents worth of pre-pub thoughts.</p>

<p>My own contribution would be in regards to dealing with the isolation and need for support -- especially for junior faculty members.</p>

		<span id="comment-12718354-content"><p>I have followed your blog since the notorious &quot;office&quot; incident, which was mentioned only very obliquely in the British academic press. One had to track you down, but it was worth it.</p>

<p>I am a legal blogger in the UK. Unlike the US, we are in a minority. It has been slow to take off. I have two reasons for blogging, both quite normal. One is commentary; the other research. I find it extremely useful as I work on my research projects to be able to jot down a series of thoughts that don&#39;t have to be as refined as is needed for an academic journal. Moreover, of course, they are published immediately. Doing this actually helps me clarify my thoughts in my research. When writing the academic journal piece, one is always rephrasing, rejigging, and never quite committing until the deadline so insists. The blog releases me from that pressure.</p>

<p>Since I&#39;ve started blogging, I have found it a way of doing research. I hadn&#39;t realised how many blogs there were or how informative they could be. So without doubt they are now a necessary part of my research equipment.</p>

<p>With commentary, I like the immediacy of being able to respond to events, announcements, and so on. For example, today Prime Minister Blair introduced a new program dealing with &quot;anti-social behavior&quot; which, if brought in, will remove any right to due process. Since the UK has no constitution in the American sense, it&#39;s important to be able to argue in a public forum about these things. And usually, there are connections with my research as well, so the research and commentary go together.</p>

<p>From next year, I&#39;m going to use blogging as a teaching tool.</p>

<p>With best wishes</p>

<p>John</p>

		<span id="comment-12997800-content"><p>It&#39;s obvious enough, but I&#39;ve never seen anyone mention the superiority of links to footnotes. If you want to follow up on a footnote it takes a trip to the library, and time.</p>

<p>The internet also picks up the pace of research, and it&#39;s scope, manyfold. Everyone in the world interested in a specialized topic could be in instant communication all the time. That&#39;s just a theoretical possibility and hardly a desirable one, but things are really quicker.</p>

<p>Once a blogger has a quality group of commenters, the conversations become very rich. I recommend &quot;language hat&quot; for an example of what can happen. Not every thread catches fire, but the best ones are amazing.  There was quite an expert but nonspecialist discussion of certain points about Australian languages recently.</p>

<p>As a research tool the internet is like an imperfect archive with strong parts and missing parts. It&#39;s better for secondary and peripheral interests than for primary interests, and better for scouting sources and details than for the actual research.</p></span>

Should I say that, in the tradition of Brian Eno , I too took a plastic bladder to Le Centre Pompidou and urinated in Duchamp's magnum opus? Because I didn't. I've never even been to France. I've been through France. But I've never stayed there. (Which is sad, since after English and Italian and Latin, it's the only other language I know. Sure, I can read German, but reading knowledge counts for dirt.) But this post isn't about the French. (Nor is it about the brilliant terrorists who kidnapped a French man and said they wouldn't release him until France recalled all the troops they haven't deployed to the country they haven't deployed them to. Can you imagine the horror that hostage felt? Not only was he held hostage . . . he had to stomach the fact that his terrorists like to hump doorknobs.) I'm digressing. Like compulsively like. All I want to say is that the idealist in me still believes that examining popular culture pays cognitive (and potentially political) dividends. Teaching students how to &quot;read&quot; the shows and films and music they fetishize should be among a teacher's first priorities. When anti-intellectual critics complain about university professors teaching courses on contemporary rap I can't help but think &quot;Isn't that the role of the intellectual? Shouldn't we concentrate on the materials our students confront daily?&quot; Instead we insist on introducing them to unfamiliar material about which they cogitate for our courses but don't think about daily. Yes Yes Yes this is the old debate about whether we should uplift our students' understanding or teach them to think more good about the shit they think about anyway. (Yes Yes Yes intentional and for effect.) Since this question is more often avoided than answered I thought I'd re-re-re-re-repose it here. What should we be doing? Teaching them to &quot;read&quot; Titanic intelligently or teaching them to appreciate Joyce? (Because these options are mutually exclusive, see. They can't coexist, see. It's one or the other, see.)</span></a></div>

Adam will respond to our responses. We'll respond to his. You'll respond to ours. He'll respond to yours. It will be supremely eventful. Be there. Or don't be. Then regret it. Forever. Also: If you would like to add &quot;Guest Poster on Acephalous&quot; to your résumé (who wouldn't?) drop me a line when you've finished reading the novel with a general idea of what you'd like to write about and I'll consider you for the position. Of &quot;Guest Poster.&quot; On this here illustrious blog. (Your name could appear in The Minnesota Review.)</span></a></div>
