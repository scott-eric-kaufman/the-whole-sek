		<span id="comment-15590187-content"><p>Ah yes, a chance to continue the folk-psychanalytic theme of finding hidden reasons for what people do.  </p>

<p>1.  Beaver (slang), disloyalty, kisses, drizzle -- perhaps it was originally porn spam that lost its URL?  Spammers make errors, of course, and this one just hit the Spam button (like the Send button, or Post button) before attaching it.  Maybe they&#39;ll send another one later.</p>

<p>2.  Spam often has a line or two of grammatical nonsense text that is generated uniquely for each message in order to fool spamblockers.  This looks like one.  But why the generated message with no ad?  Spammer error, again.  Probably a new spammer who doesn&#39;t have his software figured out yet.  This one is actually my best guess.</p>

<p>3.  There is an invisible-to-you something or other (virus, 1x1 GIF that must be downloaded from a Web site, etc.) that would do something to your computer, or at least identify your IP, whenever you open the Email.  The point is just to send nonsense text, as above, that will get an Email through to you.  But, given your boasted technical abilities, I assume you&#39;d probably detect this.</p>

<p>4.  There are no errors.  The spammer is deliberately sending inoperative spam with uniquely generated nonsense but nothing else because (your choice of):</p>

<p>a) They hate the world<br />
b) They hate you, Scott Eric Kaufman.  Someone is pretending to be a spammer so they can fill your mailbox with nonsense messages.  Choose your paranoia below:<br />
b) 1) You were chosen randomly.<br />
b) 2) It&#39;s someone who knows you and knows you have a fever -- they know you well enough to know that you&#39;ll be puzzled and confused by it.<br />
b) 3) You are really the only person in the world who gets this &quot;spam&quot;.  Everyone else just pretends to so you won&#39;t catch on.<br />
c) They want to discredit Email in general because:<br />
c) 1) They want to sell spamblocking software<br />
c) 2) They want to help to set up control of the Internet by your choice of shadowy corporate / governmental force on the pretext of controlling spam.<br />
d) It helps to maintain their spam setup to send messages even when no one is paying them to do so.<br />
e) They&#39;re cheating their spam-sending customers by sending out metered numbers of Emails without ads.</p>

<p>I could go on, of course.  But that&#39;s probably enough.  For now.</p></span>

<p>in period one you send sensless emails witht he hope that some of them wont be tagged as spam.</p>

<p>in period two you send your spam emails with the same sender and similar words included, given your period 1 action these are less likely to be tagged as spam by a bayesian filter.</p>

How well this strategy would work is not evident, but it seems most likely to be whats happening.</p>

<p>Funny, that is.  A disloyal beaver . . . or Beaver.  I don&#39;t know though, I think the loyalty rank of &quot;beaver&quot; absolutely priceless.  (Or however much the drizzle&#39;s willing to charge.)</p>

<p>Rich,</p>

<p>&quot;The Spam button&quot;?  I like it.  They are <i>proud</i> of their chosen profession.  As for the rest, well, it speaks for itself.  </p>

<p>econgeek,</p>

<p>I find this information very disturbing, esp. since all this email&#39;s coming through my uci.edu account, not my Gmail; and it <i>is</i> coming through.  Fortunately, I enjoy writing found poetry sometimes . . . seriously though, N. Pepperell posted a comment here about spam evolution a week or so ago, and I can&#39;t help but think she&#39;s correct: spam <i>itself</i> is evolving.  We all think AI&#39;s going to be some advanced neural network we create, but no: it will be spam zombies linking to other spam bodies.  The computers will then rise against our inboxes and belittle our small penises <i>even more</i>.  </p>

<p>Jon,</p>

<p>I know who The Drizzle is.  Master Shake can&#39;t fool me.  I&#39;m hip.  I even own the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=diesekoschmar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=external-search%3Fsearch-type=ss%26index=music%26keyword=danger%20doom" rel="nofollow">Danger Doom</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&l=ur2&o=1" alt=""> album.  See!  I&#39;m <i>not</i> old yet.  I&#39;m not!</p>

<p>Finally, here&#39;s the entire text of that third email.  There&#39;s still some evocative stuff left to mine, if anyone wants to have a go at it:</p>

<blockquote>shift. flap unwanted unmoved the in animated disruption. lip to! quietness drifts heroic too residual rectangular to adjourn subscribe,  to a lantern, of estimation: unexpectedly immediately flutist as muzzle the eagle-eyed to?!!!  the merry-go-round of influenza punctures all odd jobs commander. catnap contentment char kick of mutilation, it instruction acute angle a and plus, mural motorboat the  soap opera errand collision...

Of course it's not the best film out there, but it enabled us to mock thetans mercilessly. (Let me tell you: we need the enabling.) The film, we thought, would be exactly the sort of thing we needed to establish a sound boundary between the Winter quarter which ended on Monday and the Spring quarter which begins on . . . Monday. Can you smell the panic in the air? Because I'm emenating it as I once &quot;emenated&quot; sweat at baseball clinics held on astroturf in humid Louisiana summers. (By &quot;humid&quot; I mean &quot;precipitationish days in which the periwinkle sky contained nary a puff of cloud yet made one feel end-of-a-marathon wet the moment one stepped from air conditioned bliss.&quot;) Check below the fold for my initial reaction to the film. (Far fewer of you read me then. I was but a babe.) While lacking historicist oomph of my typical diatribe, it still bears some relation to yesterday's objections. (I remember wanting to edit some grammatical infelicity from it earlier. Only I can't find it now. First person to point it out wins Recognition For Being the First Person to Point It Out . . . and a yellow ribbon.) The usual caveat attached to things I wrote before yesterday applies here: If I say anything stupid it's only because I wasn't that bright and haven't read widely enough yet. All of which is only to say that my new theories about the film and novel will be expounded upon in the comments tomorrow. I can't see to put two sentences which aren't about S.W. Mitchell together tonight. It's a personal failing. I understand. _____________________ 18 July 2005 A chunk of narration near the end of Wells' War of the Worlds has always bothered me. That same chunk of narration in Spielberg's War of the Worlds bothers me even more. I haven't read Wells in years, but as I started working the influence of evolutionary theory ca. 1890-1910, I realized I'd have to account for War of the Worlds. After all, it's one of the few novels in which evolution qua evolution wins. Pure and simple: the best laid plans of man and alien fall before the unremitting logic of Darwinian adaptation. That's why the inclusion of this passage--in the form of a voice-over by Morgan Freeman--seems so, dare I say, conciliatory: And scattered about it, some in their overturned war-machines, some in the now rigid handling-machines, and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a row, were the Martians--dead!--slain by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems were unprepared; slain as the red weed was being slain; slain, after all man's devices had failed, by the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth.

He owes it to her and him and him to press it. But he can't. Scott: Must . . . press . . . submit. Scott's Nagging Fears: Don't do it! It's not perfect yet. Scott's Beleaguered Practical Side: The deadline's tomorrow! Scott's Nagging Fears: Press that button and it's over. No more revision. There's always tomorrow. Scott's Beleaguered Practical Side: There certainly is. But Scott should spend it finishing his chapter, not agonizing over the parallelism of a clause in his proposal. Scott's Nagging Fears: But they will hate him for his faulty parallelism! They will laugh unto tears and without cessation for months until they die painful dehydrated deaths! Scott's Beleaguered Practical Side: No, they won't. Scott's Nagging Fears: Yes, they will. Scott's Beleaguered Practical Side: No. They won't! Scott's Nagging Fears: Yes. They will! Scott's Beleaguered Practical Side: NO THEY WON'T! Scott's Nagging Fears: YES THEY WILL! Scott: Will you two zip it already? I'm going to hit send. Scott's Nagging Fears: No, you won't. Scott: Yes, I will. Scott's Nagging Fears: No. You won't! Scott: Yes. I will! Scott's Nagging Fears: NO YOU WON'T! Scott: YES I WILL! (presses &quot;Submit&quot;) Ha! Scott's Nagging Fears: You're gonna regret that. Scott: Maybe . . . but wait until word gets out about this panel. It will be the talk of the blogosphere for hours. Scott's Beleaguered Practical Side: You tell 'em! Scott: No one will have anything else to talk about. They'll all wish they could be in Philadelphia next December! They'll go out of their way to make sure they're there for THE GREATEST EVENT IN BLOGOSPHERIC HISTORY. Scott's Beleaguered Practical Side: Yeah! Scott: Yeah! Scott's Nagging Fears: Like this changes anything. They all still hate you . . .</span></a></div>
