After all, [Ebert's blog at the Sun Times] started after all the physical damage had been done to his appearance … Okay, so thus far it can be chalked up to the usual debate style of the Left. But here’s what concerns me about his state of mind … I don’t care what his political beliefs are, ultimately. I care about his mental faculties, and how he is undermining his own legacy as one of cinema’s great champions. I really wish he would return to the balcony. This is, I believe, a new conservative tactic: “I disagree with the partisan pollster you agree with, but instead of acknowledging that the obverse is also true, I will assume that during your struggle with thyroid cancer and the seven painful, but ultimately unsuccessful, surgeries to restore the ability to eat, drink and speak that followed—I’ll assume that somewhere in there you lost your mind and I’ll just mourn your death now, so can you please shut the fuck up already?” Seriously, that last line about “return[ing] the balcony” sounds like nothing so much as a former slave-owner longing for the days before all his former charges had the right to say whatever they damned well pleased. Meyers is annoyed because Ebert’s expressing the opinions he’s always held, but is blaming Ebert for his own inability to separate the body of work from the man who produced it. I wonder how he feels about Faulkner, whose politics he would (I hope) disavow as adamantly as he does Ebert’s? UPDATE: Crap! Meyers is absolutely correct, or so I must assume because, like Ebert, I'm in no position to judge. I apologize in advance for the misunderstanding." />

<p><i>Yet I have to wonder if the physical and mental trauma Roger has endured has taken a toll on his mind</i></p>

<p>Ebert:<br />
</i>One night, unable to speak, I caught the eye of a nurse through my open door and pointed to the blood leaking from my hospital gown. She pushed a panic button and my bed was surrounded by an emergency team, the duty physician pushing his fingers with great force against my carotid artery to halt the bleeding. I was hoisted on my sheet over to a gurney, and raced to the OR. &quot;Move it, people,&quot; he shouted. &quot;We&#39;re going to lose this man.&quot;</p>

<p>I was calm and completely lucid. I watched like an interested observer. The pain medication probably detached me. My wife hadn&#39;t then told me that after a previous rupture, I&#39;d been declared dead on the operating table. </i></p>

<p>Besides being creepy, Meyers is imbecile. </p>

In other words, questioning, debating, falsifying, or writing a comprehensively-footnoted and exhaustively-researched dissertation disproving beyond a shadow of a doubt, whatever claim has been advanced by someone with a right-wing pov comes under the heading of &quot;the usual debate style of the Left&quot; with its querulous overtone of petulent snittery at the wilful unfairness and dishonesty involved in the Left&#39;s aggravating refusal to simply see things from the right point of view.</p></span>

Part II will be up tomorrow.] David Axe's War Is Boring belongs, in a very general sense, to the grand tradition of American road trip narratives. Unlike Steinbeck's Travels with Charley, in which the Nobel Laureate set out to reconnect with an idea of America; or Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, in which the good doctor set out to obliterate that notion altogether; or Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, in which a creative writing professor ignores both the country and all notions of it in favor of calling attention to his own profundity—that is to say, unlike those nonfictional account of road trips by American authors, the travel narrative that frames War Is Boring is not aimed at an American audience. I mean this literally: Axe recalls the past five years of his life as a United Nations van and its driver, Adrian Djimdim, shepherd him across Chad. That he tells his story to someone who has experienced life in a conflict zone is significant because it allows him the sympathetic space required to recount the intimate moments and minor worries of combat life without seeming a solipsist. The wars to which he flashes back in conversation are not about him in the way that Salinas is about Steinbeck, Las Vegas about Thompson, or Pirsig about Pirsig. They are not an extension of himself because War Is Boring partakes of no Emersonian &quot;upbuilding of a man&quot; and Axe refuses to serve as a delegate for our moral improvement. For example, later in the novel, after being mistaken for former U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix, he informs Djimdim that: As Djimdim is presented as an observant listener, he must have recognized that Axe had fed him a similar line earlier: Note that the difference is not in growth, but simple addition: Axe doesn't correct him, he merely adds the names of his actual employers, committing what could be called a sin of omission by addition. He presents himself here not as a model to be emulated, but a person for whom old, successful habits die hard—that is, as a sympathetic example of our flawed species.* But War Is Boring is always as much about the narrative as it is the narrator, even when the stakes of the conflicts narrated are not altogether clear. While that might seem a criticism of the book, I don't mean it as such. The view from the ground will always be more chaotic than its aerial equivalent, as Axe himself argues via juxtapositions like those that open his chapter on East Timor: The helicopter is as isolated from the events below as it is in Axe's camera, but for the moment, so is Axe. That first panel fails to inform us whether the narrative is in its Chadian frame or East Timor, and the second one only provides visual clues as to when and where we are. Moreover, the perspective Axe and, through him,...</span></a></div>

It's the Internets. In another shining example of the inability of blog-aggregator algorithms to parse original content—the champion in this regard still being the utterly useless thing that is Technorati—this somehow happened: Deadline | Hollywood /Film MTV Movies Blog Cinematical FirstShowing.net Pajiba Twitch The Big Picture Cartoon Brew Film School Rejects RopeofSilicon Frankly My Dear… Film Experience Blog Robert Pattinson Life Self-Styled Siren Sunset Gun Trek Movie Report FilmoFilia Some Came Running Acephalous ← HERE I AM THIS IS ME What Would Toto Watch? Get the Big Picture Michael Sporn Animation – Splog Thrilling Days of Yesteryear Twilightish The IFC Blog scanners Edward Copeland on Film Upcoming Pixar rediff Movies While I'm heartened to see that Big Hollywood didn't even place or show, the prize for the illustrious honor of being the twentieth best film blog in September is, so far as I can tell, being bombarded by sandal-spam. So if comments end up in moderation, it's not because I hate you, or don't brook dissent, or am censoring you, but because I've switched my spam-phaser from &quot;stun&quot; to &quot;kill.&quot; Have no fears: if you're an actual person whose comment gets caught in the crossfire, I know how to reanimate you. (Odd that I prefer zombie-comments to spam, but that's the way of the world these days.)</span></a></div>
