<p><i>Oh</i> yes.  My favourite is his take on the British House of Lords, and the wrinkled ermine-wearing old codgers therein.  His logic: &#39;Marquis&#39; derives from the Germanic for &#39;Steel-hard warrior&#39;, or somesuch.  Therefore any marquisses not steel-hard should be stripped of the title.  Hurrah to that.<br />

Instead of a etymological trace of conservatism that ties the word (and its adherents) back to the past, it seems more likely that the author thinks the word names a concept &quot;inescapably tied to the past&quot;--and that the name itself merely reveals the conceptual underpinnings of the language we use to talk about it. &quot;Thus,&quot; the idea of religion is one inherently conservative (or reactionary) because it <i>is</i>, not because the <i>meaning of the word</i> is. One&#39;s problem on this level (if one still has a problem with the author&#39;s assertion) may be with the fact that my explanation depends upon a <i>descriptivist</i> theory about language: the word religion would have to arise from a predetermined <i>meaning</i> of the concept of religion, which would seem to have to rely on a prelinguistic sense of meaning, which would seem to make no sense. But that seems to be a different problem. And yet: the CFP makes a rich assertion...</p></span>

		<span id="comment-13814883-content"><p>William, I agree with you on all points.  The author of that CFP certainly employed a short-hand, but what I would say, and as you say, the assertion is rich . . . pregnant, really, with implications which, given the methodology implicitly employed, can&#39;t pass muster.  I agree with you that the topic itself sounds sensible enough.  It&#39;s the angle of approach which concerns me, partly because, our conversation aside, I can&#39;t tell whether it&#39;s merely &quot;an angle,&quot; i.e. rhetorical short-hand for a substantial body of thought, or whether it&#39;s an instantiation of a particular (and particularly lazy) form of poststructuralist argument.  (I <i>think</i> that may have made sense, but I&#39;m not thinking too well tonight . . . which means I ought to stop responding to comments I&#39;ve had a mind to respond to now for days.)</p></span>

A time when no quoted Derrida . . . when no one had heard of Foucault . . . before structuralism presented itself to be posted. I refuse to buy into the myth. Nor do I think that post '66 criticism represents the nadir of human intellectual achievement. But then again I don't feel very old. Like others who haven't been tethered to this maypole long enough to become vomitously embittered, I see these compulsive acts of demarcation as tedious exercises in rote aggression. When I get in conversations of this sort, I imagine respondants moving as if through Jello . . . grasping at tufts of carpet as they make their way to their computers to confront some stranger whose point irked them from their beds. They type like drones. As their words drawl across the page they imagine revolutions in their head only to have them sag like the jeans they've worn two weeks straight: in all the wrong places but without that low-class look all the ladies seem to dig. (No one digs such slobs as these.) Or maybe I'm projecting. Needless to say I don't think there's been a golden age of criticism. Since learning that I'd be hitting the market as a Nineteenth Century Americanist I've started reading nineteenth century literature as I fall asleep. (When I'm not too busy indulging in adolescent fantasies.) That may sound like a slap across the face of nineteenth century American literature. It isn't. More often than not it keeps me up at night. (Especially Hawthorne . . . especially his short fiction.) But because the majority of my complete collection of nineteenth century American literature comes from the estate of an emeritus Americanist who passed away some time ago, all of my books are hopelessly outdated. As I read Milton R. Stern's edition of Billy Budd (1974) I'm as struck by the confidence beaming through its footnotes as I am by its disturbingly burnt orange cover. Because Melville died before completing Billy Budd, sussing out his final editorial decisions should be a difficult task . . . unless you are a sure-handed critic writing at the height of your belief in your own informed infallibility. In which case you would declare with absolute certainly that although it is difficult to know whether Melville abandoned the idea but left the notation on the page, or whether he planned an addition on this subject. Presumably he would have included it had he lived to complete a final copy. (Emphasis totally in the original.) That &quot;presumably&quot; works its way under my skin because I simply cannot imagine a comfortable familiarity secure enough to allow myself to presume how an author of Melville's stature would line edit his novel. I simply can't. I don't think less of Stern for trying but I do think that the sort of supposition lands well beyond the pale of contemporary scholarship. Or maybe...</span></a></div>

(That's still legal, isn't it?) I think this is partly because I'm not satisfied with any available Plan B, but I also think that I'm involved in too many conversations to begin again anew tonight. So I've invented a holiday instead. From this point forward, February 4th will be You Read, You Link Or Else Day. (&quot;Is that a veiled threat there Scott?&quot; &quot;No, it's not veiled at all. Now link already or face the consequences.&quot; &quot;What's behind Door #3?&quot; &quot;A couple of goats and a spokesmodel gussied up like a Hee Haw extra.&quot; &quot;Alright then, I'll &quot;or face the consequences, Scott.&quot;) So be there or be square . . . . . . ly beaten with a broomstick for what we both know you've done. I intended this to be a &quot;link post&quot; but decided that there's only so much self-promotion an audience can take before it starts in with the &quot;WE HATE YOU PHIL COLLINS!&quot; So no links.
