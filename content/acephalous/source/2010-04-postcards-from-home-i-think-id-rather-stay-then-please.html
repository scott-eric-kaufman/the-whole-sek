			<p>As I&#39;m currently trapped not only in England (<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/04/i-have-run-away-to-england-i-have.html">by a volcano</a>) but inside (<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/04/look-up-in-the-sky-its-a-bird-its-a-plane.html">by a rampaging cold</a>), I thought I&#39;d reconnect with the American political discourse I miss so much by reading <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/an-intimate-evening-with-sarah-palin/article1537275/">a transcript</a> of Sarah Palin&#39;s speech in Hamilton, Ontario last week. &#0160;For a little under two hundred grand, some lucky Canadians were treated to some theater whose absurd circularity does Beckett proud. &#0160;More on that in a moment, though, as I first want to make something absolutely clear: Sarah Palin does not scare me. &#0160;No one whose speech twists into modernist thickets&#0160;<em>while ordering coffee </em>counts as a worthy political opponent; but as she is a political force amongst people who think no sandbox is complete without a couple of blowtorches—the parenting equivalent of having her serve as Commander in Chief—I feel it my duty as an American to condense her Hamilton speech down to its Platonic essence:&#0160;</p><blockquote><p>This is such a melting pot. &#0160;This is so beautiful. &#0160;I love this diversity. &#0160;There were a whole bunch of guys named &quot;Tony&quot; in the photo line.</p>

Not that I would think that God would speak through me, but wanting to leave you with a little bit of inspiration and encouragement and maybe on a personal level have a conversation with you about some of the things that Todd and I have been through in the last year and a half, the last couple of years, that hopefully you can learn a couple of lessons from, because we&#39;ve been through quite a few challenges, quite a few battles and you all too, everybody goes through battles, everybody has challenges. &#0160;Some are played out in the newspapers, some of ours have been. &#0160;Maybe yours have not been, but everybody has to make tough decisions and prioritize things in life and here we are tonight, given an opportunity to come together to reach out to help others, to help children, who are in need. &#0160;We don&#39;t want to squander this opportunity, we want to be inspired and encourage and remember that though we all do go through some tough challenging times, we talked at the head table tonight that we need to be able to count our blessings, not our problems. &#0160;We need to share our blessings, so we&#39;ll do a little bit about that tonight.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I pause to ask the pressing question: do any among you have any clue what this woman is talking about? &#0160;<em>Does she</em>? &#0160;My answer, as you might figure, is a vehement: &quot;No, with thunder.&quot; &#0160;She is <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/and_yet_i_still.html">making me uncomfortable with her words and what she says</a> not because of their content, as they&#39;re free of that burden, but because of their form; or, more accurately, their formlessness. Nine hundred poor Canadians purchased $200 tickets to listen to the segue-free ramblings of a woman who forgets the subject of her sentence by the time she reaches the verb, then the verb by the time she reaches the object <em>but keeps talking anyway</em>. &#0160;Such is, after all, the beauty of talking points: so long as you say them all, the coherence of the speech containing them is inconsequential. &#0160;&quot;Sound bites&quot; are called &quot;bites&quot; instead of &quot;meals&quot; for a reason now.</p>

<p>My favorite section was where she&#39;s trying to make connections with Canadians over accent and lower 48 ignorance anecdotes and wartime panic highway construction... &quot;With wildlife and resources and again with that work ethic and that pioneering spirit that just flows through Canada, that’s my state too, that’s Alaska. ... I feel right at home here with you all, I think we share a lot with that accent.&quot; </p>

<p>But the whole performance really has to be taken in context to be understood. It&#39;s a collage of elements picked up in her rise to Governor, the pregnancies, the VP run, the post-election scandals and resignation, the palm-writing incident -- and that says everything to me, that she&#39;s still flogging that hand-note schtick as though it were actually funny, as though she&#39;d scored points somehow instead of embarassed herself and her party (R or T, whatever). That speech is the sum total of her experience, politically and personally, without editing or organization (I defy anyone to outline that monstrosity!) except that she is at the center, that she has never been wrong, and that her place in the world is in service to a greater good. Which is why she&#39;s not going away.</p></span>

<p>But then because it is sllloowww at the office today, I clicked through the link to the actual transcript: Hey, Scott&#39;s being wicked lazy, he hardly reworked this at all. Wait. Waiiiiit. Aw jesus.</p></span>

I&#39;m not even making fun, it&#39;s true and very, very odd. SEK, you&#39;ve worked with students writing in English as their second language, right? In college I lived with kids studying abroad and saw a similar style, and now I edit things occasionally written by someone who doesn&#39;t have English as their first language, and I&#39;ve seen these mistakes. </p>

The only thing Obama did wrong was actually try say something interesting on a question most politicians would wave off with a dismissive cliche. Palin&#39;s speech is nothing but dismissive cliches, some of which weren&#39;t even cliches before Palin started perpetrating them.</p></span>

<p>I think that&#39;s what Fritz is basing his opinion of our opinion of Palin on, that if one person on the web holds opinion A and opinion B, then (contrary to all known experience) everyone else on the web who agrees with A must also agree with B.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am over thinking this.  Sorry if I just laid down a lecture on you.</p></span>

Up in the sky!  It's a bird!  It's a plane!</strong> It is! It is a plane!

Some flights are taking off, certainly, but until the ratio of scheduled-to-cancelled flights is 10-to-1 instead of the other way around, I'm not holding my breath. (Nor do I need to, as I've acquired a head cold so massive I needn't worry about breathing volcanic ash or, for that matter, much of anything else. More updates when my cheeks stop trying to drum my teeth from my head via wave after pounding wave of congestive pressure.)</span></a></div>
