<p>As the premier <em>Dark Knight</em> poster ’round these parts, it <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/07/25/obamawayne-2008-mccainwayne-2008/#comment-16023"><del>has been demanded of</del></a>, er, <em>falls upon me to</em>
draw your attention to an interview with Christopher Nolan and
Christian Bale in which the pair reveal their Batman is based on Edmund
Morris’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375756787/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt</em></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812966007/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Theodore Rex</em></a>.*
In the interview, Bale admits to confusion when the Nolans — brother
Jonathan co-writes Christopher’s films — insisted he read <em>The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt</em> before they began principle photography on <em>Batman Begins</em>.&nbsp; Nolan then explains (and I paraphrase):</p>
<blockquote><p>Batman’s not as unique as people think. Grant Bob Kane’s
Gotham is New York and Batman has a direct historical precedent in
Theodore Roosevelt. His father, Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., had been one
of the city’s preeminent philanthropists — having found and funded the
New York City Children’s Aid Society, the Met, and the American Museum
of Natural History, to name a few of his charitable works — and died in
a way Morris contends traumatized his son: suddenly, from a cancer
whose existence he’d hidden, and mere hours before Theodore returned
from Harvard. In 1884, his beloved mother and wife died in the same
house, on the same day. A bereft Roosevelt set out for the Dakota
Territory shortly thereafter. He spent his time in the hinterlands
learning how to be a proper police, then applied those lessons when he
became president of the New York City Police Commissioners in 1895.
Like Batman, Roosevelt employed bleeding-edge technology into his
crime-fighting: under his watch, telephones were installed in
precincts, bicycles were deployed on beats, and various criminal
identification systems, like Bertillonage, were monkeyed about with.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The which-president-is-more-<a href="http://daveslongbox.blogspot.com/2005/09/airwolf-adjective.html"><del>Airwolf</del></a>-Batman
debate aside, Nolan’s decision to craft Batman’s appeal after
Roosevelt’s is ridiculously savvy, inasmuch as it speaks to that most
cherished (if post-dated) primal American myths: self-invention. In <em>Batman Begins</em>,
the young Bruce Wayne isn’t some spectacular physical specimen; in
fact, he’s thin, fragile, and perpetually frightened. Nolan’s direction
reinforces this: he’s either in tears, bed, or the bottom of a well in
every shot. Even Bale’s adolescent Wayne, returned from school for
Chill’s parole hearing, buries a wisp-thin frame beneath layers of
clothes as if to prevent circumstance from buffeting his head into a
doorknob. The first act of <em>Batman Begins</em> plays directly into the Roosevelt mystique, <em>i.e.</em> the frail boy who refines his body into a weapon.&nbsp; The first film ends, then, much where Morris’ <em>Rise</em>
does: his reputation established, his name to be reckoned with, but his
future uncertain. Where does this self-made man fit in the political
machine in which he’ll have to function? What compromises must he make?
What ideals must he betray in order to act upon? </p>
<p>I can’t do much in the way of answering these questions myself, as
my copies of the Morris are at home, but I’d be curious to do a closer
inspection of <em>Theodore Rex</em> alongside <em>The Dark Knight</em>,
if only to ask questions like “What will be Batman’s San Juan Hill?”
I’m not sure what I’m up to here, whether I’m following broad parallels
between Roosevelt’s life and the Batman mythos, or more specific
correspondences between Morris’ life of Roosevelt and Nolan’s films.
The former would speak more to Batman’s cultural appeal, but the latter
has the virtue of being, you know, <em>doable</em>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">*I’m not sure where I saw this interview.&nbsp; A <a href="http://www.frankmurphy.com/labels/bats.html">quick search</a> suggests I was watching <a href="http://www.history.com/shows.do?action=detail&amp;episodeId=322796"><em>Batman Unmasked: The Psychology of the Dark Knight</em></a> on The History Channel, but that can’t be correct, as there ain’t no such beast where I’m at.

McCain/Wayne 2008?</strong> (x-posted) Having failed in my attempt to compel Adam to discuss The Dark Knight in terms of Schmitt, Benjamin, or Agamben — the perpetual state of emergency and what-not — I was content to let the matter drop. But as a future professor of literature somewhere, preferably in the near future, I can’t let the conservative push to lionize Bush-as-Batman or the liberal push to demonize Batman-as-Bush stand. Both interpretations are naive inasmuch as they mistake the depiction of an issue for an endorsement of it. The conversations on Unfogged about the impossibility of an anti-war film always annoyed me because they either 1) knighted those most likely to misunderstand the most basic literary devices — like irony — the final arbiters of meaning; or 2) devolved into polite-but-pointed accusations about who really loves watching people-bits scatter across the sky. In professional-literary-type terms, the conversations flat-lined somewhere between Fishian reader-response and crude Freudian insinuation. Needless to say, neither of these modes produces much in the way of value. To return to The Dark Knight: although not immediately evident, the film is profoundly critical of the current administration and its policies. Its utilitarian compromises — the surveillance system, Batman in the box with the Joker — are criticized by sound moral agents as they occur: Lucius threatens to quit, Gordon breaks for the door. The problem, in both instances, is that neither Lucius nor Gordon has the authority or muscle to stop Batman. Their attempt to stop Batman from compromising his moral authority fails; and their failure leads directly to Batman’s debasement at film’s end. But I’m getting ahead of myself here. (Way ahead of myself, as I meant to note that one of the reasons I’ve written so much about The Dark Knight isn’t because I’m a fanboy — although I am — but because it’s a such a rare horse: a film as substantial as it is popular and can be discussed with an audience unaccustomed to literary analysis. It’s as if the world itself has done the reading.) In Batman Begins, the formative event in Bruce Wayne’s life is the murder of his unambiguously good parents. To young Wayne, their commonplace death — nothing atypical about urban violence in impoverished cities — represents a radical wrong in the moral order of his universe. The depth of his belief in its wrongness is evident in the lengths he goes to combat it: the years of training, thieving, imprisonment, &amp;c. It was all for naught. As Ra’s al Ghul said, when a city is so corrupt criminal organizations can infiltrate its highest offices, only a purging fire can set matters right. Nothing more unusual here than the standard revolution-as-social-reform, proceduralism-won’t-work line. Given the dystopia that is Gotham in the first film, Ra’s al Ghul is certainly right. Wayne’s solution is quasi-proceduralist, inasmuch as he introduces a radical element within the extant social structure in order to provide Gordon, Dent, and Dawes time and space enough to prosecute via conventional means....</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/07/somewhere-in-si.html"><span><strong>Brain-damaged historians</strong> (x-posted.) Somewhere in Silas Weir Mitchell's voluminous correspondence on the brain damage of Civil War veterans—my notes are in California, I'm now in Texas—is an account of a Confederate soldier whose bullet-struck head recoiled into a dry-stone wall and performed a fortuitous auto-trepanation. The insult to his brain had been mitigated by the hole in head, but Mitchell feared the soldier would never regain normal cognitive function. As time tripped over nothing, cursed in tongues, begged passersby for aid and, roundly rebuffed, stumbled on, the soldier slowly found himself again. Eventually he could move, see, speak, form new memories and remember the old ones. He was as he'd been before the war, but for the brutal fact he saw in still life: The dog is across the room curled before the fire. Blink. The dog is on its hind legs staring out the window. Blink. The dog is in the middle of the room facing him. Blink. The dog is sinking its wet nose into the crook of his arm. Blink. The dog is across the room curled before the fire. The soldier suffered what we now call akinetopsia or motion blindess.* The effect represented by crude blinks above is better, if more crudely, represented about 5 minutes and 14 seconds into this clip, which captures the fear and paranoia Mitchell assumed would accompany akinetopsia. Items like fans would be particularly disturbing because they produced a constant impression upon the skin by a process undetectable to the patient, for whom the blades would jump—jump—jump instead of spinning. But Mitchell was less concerned with akinetopsia itself than one of its side-effects: the ghostly motion trails produced by items in motion. Stand before a motion-blind person, do a jumping jack, and he will describe two scenes: a first in which your arms are at your sides, and a second in which your arms stand solid above your head, but are followed by a faint trace of the space they traveled, like the long exposure photograph on the right (original) only far less pronounced. Mitchell believed these traces might be related to what would have been his crowning achievement were it not for Charlotte Perkins Gilman: phantom limb syndrome. Normal brains need not speculate as to how your arm moved from Point A to Point B because it registered Points A.001 up through A.999; that is, it receives sequential sense impressions of your arm as it travels from hips to head.** A motion-blind brain only receives sensory impressions from Points A and B, but because it knows arms must move through space, it compensates for what it can't perceive by drawing diaphanous snow-angels in the air. It does so, Mitchell believed, because even damaged brains know how they ought to behave. They know what stimuli they should be receiving and, in their absence, choose to receive them anyway. For Mitchell, the brain is but a forlorn lover refusing to acknowledge its loss: lop off an arm at the elbow and it will insist...</span></a></div>
