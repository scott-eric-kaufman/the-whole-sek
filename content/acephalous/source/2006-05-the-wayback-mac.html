<p>The discussion at <a href="http://thevalve.org/">The Valve</a> keeps spurring memories of my erstwhile conversion to Church of Theory and Latter Day Feints in the Spring of '98.&nbsp; [<em>Ugh.</em>]&nbsp; <a href="http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/ENGLISH/Staff/richter/theory.html"><em>The Critical Tradition</em></a>

phrase, not mine.)&nbsp; [<em>Don't you love how I complain about tediously overwritten prose in tediously overwritten prose?&nbsp; I'm so ironic.&nbsp; And intentionally, no less.</em>]&nbsp; And so when it came time to write an Honors thesis,
I chose the topic closest to my heart: &quot;a Wittgensteinian critique of
the discursive function of the feminine and the cyborg in <em>schlemihlhood</em> in Thomas Pynchon's <em>V.&nbsp; </em>and <em>Gravity's Rainbow</em>.&quot;&nbsp; According to my abstract,</p><blockquote><p>By
utilizing Donna Harraway's all-inclusive conception of cyborg identity
I will investigate the realities Pynchon imposes on his characters'
bodies without limiting the factual information provided about those
realities to the demands on a system I impose on the text.&nbsp; Instead I
will work with the epistemological boundaries present in the text
itself, provided by the interaction of the historical details, literary
allusions, and philosophical and scientific arguments.&nbsp; This will allow
me to explicate the text's complexity without reducing it to a more
palatable but less accurate representation of itself.&nbsp; [<em>Why didn't I take the opportunity to interlace criticism into this beastly paragraph?&nbsp; See the mistakes an amateur blogger will make?</em>]<em>&nbsp;</em>I am most
interested in how these complexities destabilize the systems which
impose limitations on the text, both from within and without; prevent
critical orthodoxies from establishing interpretive dominance based on
the discourse at work outside the novels and the imperial regimes from
establishing a hegemonic dominance based on discreet categorical
entities within the novels themselves.</p></blockquote><p>I remember
spending countless hours working on my Honors thesis, but looking back,
I wonder what I spent those hours doing.&nbsp; Certainly not anything
constructive.&nbsp; You would think the thesis that followed would be more
intelligent than its abstract, as it could not possibly be less.&nbsp; You
would be wrong.&nbsp; [<em>But if you thought I should've stopped the sentence before that one at the word &quot;abstract,&quot; removed the conjuctive &quot;as&quot; and let &quot;It could not possibly be less&quot; stand on its own, you would be right.</em>]&nbsp; The thesis of my thesis, unlike my enemy's enemy, is
no one's friend:</p><blockquote><p>Cyborg identities reveal and resist
the process of naturalization that molds bodies into categorical
entities whose social, familial, and sexual roles are predetermined,
providing what Donna Haraway calls &quot;a reference point for the
theoretical and practical struggles against...the justifications for
patriarchy, colonialism, humanism, positivism, essentialism [and]
scienticism.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>&quot;Look at how oppositional I am!&quot;
declaimed [<em>&quot;Declaimed&quot;?&nbsp; Did &quot;cried&quot; have a prior engagement?&nbsp; Was &quot;shouted&quot; booked that week?</em>] an embattled A. Cephalous.&nbsp; &quot;Whatever it is, I'm against
it!&quot;&nbsp; I attacked&nbsp; every category of category, ranting about how, &quot;like
other cyborgs, Pynchon's have their otherness written in/on their
bodies,&quot; or how &quot;this bodily otherness&nbsp; is then incorporated into their
cyborg identities, which deconstruct the wholeness implicit in the
exclusionary principle at the heart of a binary conception of
identity.&quot;&nbsp; I felt powerful.&nbsp; Who transgressed borders?&nbsp; I transgressed
borders.&nbsp; Which ones?&nbsp; Why</p><blockquote><p>the whole body of lived
social relations, since their identities are &quot;predicated on
transgressed boundaries&quot;--between such terms as organic/machinic,
man/woman, nature/culture, public/private, civilized/primitive,
heterosexual/polymorphously perverse--boundaries which society
considers inviolable.</p></blockquote><p>[<em>Finally, a bit that works from start to finish.&nbsp; Only took me, what?&nbsp; Nine-hundred words?</em>] Before the workings of my
radical mind &quot;all the formerly reliable oppositions/dualisms [were]
destabilized and the identities constructed from them [were offered] up
for reexamination.&quot;&nbsp; Then I discussed nouns and something I called &quot;the
historical/social ramifications of analytic desiccation.&quot;&nbsp; This
withering analytic tatooed shudder-quotes on the shoulders of 78% of
available nouns, and so when I turned, predictably, to discuss &quot;how
cyborg 'identity' in the form of 'information-processing devices'
[worked] to further destabilize the 'post-colonial' environs of 1922
Sudwestafrika,&quot; is it any wonder I lost track of &quot;what&quot; I had
&quot;argued&quot;?&nbsp; Was I still talking about &quot;a fundamental divide (in the
Kantian sense) between a human understanding of the world and a
knowledge of the world as it is&quot;?&nbsp; And had my &quot;argument&quot; evaporated
before or after the chart in which I made &quot;the implications of this
situation less confusing&quot; by categorizing everything as &quot;Raw Sferical
Data Weissmann Transcribes Exists in the World,&quot; &quot;Raw Data Transcribed
by Weissmann&quot; and &quot;Information Decoded by Weissmann under
Wittgensteinian Dictates&quot;?&nbsp; </p>

<p>I cannot answers these questions now, and
suspect I couldn't then either.&nbsp; (Though I would've protested, loudly,
repeatedly, loudly, repeatedly, and then rather loudly that your
inability to follow my argument is your fault.&nbsp; Jackass.)</p>

<p>Why am I sharing this?&nbsp; On the one hand, it's because I was thinking
about the vehemence of my position in the this week's discussion on the
Valve.&nbsp; How did I come to distrust the suggestiveness of Theory?&nbsp; Then
I remembered: A. Cephalous, you little shit, you penned &quot;Cyborg
Identity and the Destabilization of Epistemological Boundaries in
Thomas Pynchon's <em>V. </em>and <em>Gravity's Rainbow</em>.&quot;&nbsp; What
frightens me about this document (excerpts of which will now lurk the
darker corners of the internet until the most inopportune moment
possible) is that I earnestly believed I was saying something about
something.&nbsp; [<em>I still believe that I believed that, but I have spent one more year agonizing over the why and how-possibly-could-I-have.</em>]&nbsp; What frightens me more generally are those occasions when I
stumble across articles seemingly no better than my honors thesis in
academic journals.&nbsp; Granted, some of those critics undoubtedly walk the
walk I only talked, but since none of them really talk all that better
than I did, I wonder about the quality of their walking.&nbsp; </p>

<p>One final historical note: Seven months after completing my <em>opera mictilis </em>I
officially forswore Theory in an essay on the current state of
Hawthorne Studies.&nbsp; Why I forswore there instead of forswearing
somewhere else or appropriate even escapes me.</p>

<p>[<em>Here endeth the lesson.&nbsp; I hope those of you who hadn't read it enjoyed it, and those of you who had didn't bother to read it again.&nbsp; Great concept, lackluster execution.&nbsp; I should really revise these things and distribute them in less ephemeral format . . . </em>]</p>

		<span id="comment-16920107-content"><p>Scott, perhaps you&#39;re a good person to ask this question:  Is it me, or do some grad students have an intense, almost paralyzing fear of sounding &quot;overwrought,&quot; as you put it?  I mean, if ever there were a discipline in which sounding overwrought was somehow a virtue, English would be it.  Before going further, let&#39;s take a stab at defining &quot;overwrought.&quot;  How&#39;s this:  prose that is unnecessarily long-winded, self-indulgent, and/or ornate.  Prose that uses &quot;declaim&quot; instead of &quot;cry.&quot;  Prose that is somehow a bit &quot;much.&quot;  </p>

<p>And isn&#39;t this all a matter of taste?</p>

<p>As I was saying, overwrought is not a word that most of us would like to have used to describe our prose.  But aren&#39;t some of our favorite writers unbelievably overwrought?  How about them Victorians?  How about Henry James?  How about Fitzgerald?  Ginny Woolf can even get a tad purple at times.  But do we lambaste these writers for their being overwrought on occasion?  More often we call them eloquent and poetic and brilliant.  Their prose sparkles.  It rarely glares.</p>

<p>So I ask you why grad students (especially of the English Lit variety) and critics praise a quality in canonical writers that in their own writing is the very thing they abhor.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-16934996-content"><p>Since this is one of the few blog posts that has had a poem written about it (no, I won&#39;t bother to re-quote the whole thing one more time) I should point out that the lines &quot;Looking back / (the cyborg runs, headless)[...] Looking back, tapping, / For one last unfired&quot; predicted this re-commenting behavior of yours...<br />
 <br />
Who was it, in another thread recently, who wrote that when they felt that they weren&#39;t writing well, they liked to re-read old writings that people had once congratulated them on?  I wrote that for many people, this would just result in self-slagging of the old writings.  I expect that in another year, there will be another version of this post with more comments which will in part criticize your older comments.  After many years, the accreted layers may build the thing back up into something like the length of the original essay.  More years after that, it&#39;ll be, &quot;you know, I don&#39;t see what was so bad about my honors thesis, for its time&quot; and you&#39;ll write a whole new piece about trying to understand your younger self-criticizing self, except this time it&#39;ll be the much-revised &quot;How Not to Open, Close or Anything In-Between an Academic Essay, A Decade Later&quot; text that you&#39;ll be slagging.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, each step of the process is entertaining.  But it is like watching something between the discovery of perpetual motion and the the ecosystemic recycling of some rare raw material.  It&#39;d be difficult to judge whether it&#39;s open, closed, or anything in between.</p></span>

I look at things I wrote last fall and I cringe.</p>

<p>This likely -- or so I&#39;ve convinced myself -- accounts for why I haven&#39;t put anything through peer review for publication.  I don&#39;t want my first serious essay to be a piece of shit or something I&#39;m embarassed about in five years.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll disclaim that the style of my most recent piece was described as both &quot;excellent and well written&quot; and &quot;academic and boring&quot;.  No one, at least, complained that it was too over-wrought or filled with convoluted, hard to follow sentences.  This isn&#39;t to say that I subscribe to some sort of plain-language ideology, mind you.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-16953042-content"><p>Mike, &quot;overwrought&quot; is my favorite word to describe &quot;overwritten&quot; prose because of the false etymological connection, <i>i.e.</i> it <i>looks</i> like its past tense.  I think the problem with overwrought prose, however, is simply that it&#39;s overwrought given the context.  Here, in a blog post, it&#39;s unnecessary.  Sometimes I do it for effect, but sometimes it&#39;s just a failing of the medium, in that it&#39;s very rarely edited more than two or three times over, at most, two or three days, so there&#39;s no opportunity to prune what&#39;s written.  That said, my dissertation&#39;s incredibly overwrought right now, because I&#39;m more concerned with producing pages than prose, but at some point in the near future I&#39;m going to need to correct that.  Contra Craig, I&#39;m a bit of a plain-language ideologue, in that I believe there&#39;s no need to make complex subjects even more complex by &quot;describing&quot; or &quot;explaining&quot; them in complex prose.</p>

<p>The writers I admire boil down the complexity into digestible bits.  And, to be frank, I don&#39;t trust authors who don&#39;t; by which I mean, I don&#39;t believe they&#39;ve fully understood the material if they&#39;re not able to communicate its content in prose any person of above-average intelligence could understand with a little effort.  This isn&#39;t an argument against &quot;difficult prose,&quot; then, but &quot;<i>needlessly</i> difficult prose.&quot;  Prose in which the difficulty has some other, ostentacious and/or lazy and/or both origin.  Because there&#39;s a difference between terrible prose--say, Talcott Parsons--and needlessly difficult prose.  </p>

<p>That said, I agree with Craig, although I&#39;d accelerate his time-scale.  I wince when I re-read what I&#39;ve written the day before and curse the stupidity, hubris and laziness which contributed to its &quot;quality.&quot;  </p>

<p>N.P., in my dreams my sparkling prose will convert non-blog readers into regular blog readers, but alas! you already had a blog when you stumbled upon mine.  That said, I&#39;m so glad you did.  Rich too, for that matter, although I don&#39;t think he &quot;stumbled&quot; so much as followed the links.  </p>

<p>Rich, as I stood at third base acquiring bruises the size of softballs yesterday, I actually regretted not creating a more elaborate and entertaining gloss.  The ruse, however, was no ruse, as I was pressed for time but desirous to keep up my non-systemic-TypePad-failure-streak of posting alive.  So I could start the meta-meta-commenting today, if need be.  I actually like the Borgesian quality of the project you outline.  I need never write another blog post; I can simply continue to comment, to refine, to <i>perfect</i> the posts I&#39;ve already written.  In the end, I&#39;ll have a full account of both 2005-06, but also of all the things I wrote about in that period.  Then I could sell it as a novel, and everyone would read it and refer to each chapter in shorthand.  &quot;Wow, Fred, sounds like you had one of Scott&#39;s Mornings . . .&quot;</p></span>

I do it all the time. I'll be standing there talking to a woman only to be stricken by the sudden and irresistible urge to stare at her breasts. She'll register her discomfort by pulling her lapels close or yanking her plunging neckline chin-high. Then she'll become intensely interested in objects in the general vicinity of her feet. But I won't let that deter me. I'll continue to stare at her breasts until she won't be able to take it anymore and informs me in tones of suppressed outrage that she had some important elsewhere to be fifteen minutes ago. Then she'll never talk to me again. Such is the experience of the deaf man in America today. When the eyes of a hearing man break contact and wander south, the obvious conclusion is the correct one: he is staring at her breasts and she is justifiably uncomfortable. When a deaf man who relies on verbal cues and lip-reading to converse lets his eyes drift south of his conversant's, he stops at her lips. (You can tell because if he didn't—that is, if he actually stared at her breasts—he would have no clue how to answer whatever it is she would have said to him while he indulged in some &quot;covert&quot; sexism.) Why mention this in the one forum this commonplace of deaf life will never make anyone uncomfortable? Because I've acquired another rude habit: Talking to people while wearing headphones. People who know me—for example, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Barry Siegel—won't bat an eye when I talk to them with my headphones on because they'll know that I'm reading their lips and not paying attention to the music. They'll know that I'm so invested in the conversation that I've forgotten that I have the headphones on and have merely neglected to remove them. But other people—for example, the inimitable Gay Talese—will look at me horrified as I chat with Barry without removing my headphones. His eyes will rebel against the solipsistic impertinence of youth culture he detects in my actions. I register his discomfort but, blinded by reputation and desperately trying to impress him, I won't understand what it is I've said that so offends him. I'll rifle my brain for the offensive statement the entire walk home and come up empty. Only later that night, as I force myself to stop thinking about the events of the day, will I realize what I've done. And then? So much for sleep.</span></a></div>

Would've been already but I didn't want to bump this beauty from its deserved position of prominence.] . . . that Stanley’s figured it out. Don’t get me wrong: I love reading Fish with a passion equal in intensity to the vehemence with which I disagree with him. But how can any intellectual brawler dislike a man whose very titles “betray” aggressive condescension? “Wrong Again,” opines the title of Fish’s 1973 article in the Texas Law Review. Still don’t understand? Stanley will say it again “One More Time” (CI 6.4). Is it any wonder the likes of Walter Davis suffer from an acute “Fear of Fish” (CI 10.2)? (If you think this fear related to his stature, a smiling Fish will enumerate the reasons “Why No One’s Afraid of Wolfgang Iser” [Diacritics 11.1].) I don’t mean to suggest that his prose never misfires. For example, the regular appearance of “my italics” in his parenthetical citations demonstrate—in direct opposition to the rationale behind the quotations themselves—how manipulative Fish is. Fortunately, his manipulation quickly becomes visual, what with every other word of the other fellow’s prose being italicized. That said, his 1972 omnibus review of “Recent Studies in the English Renaissance” is the only viscerally enjoyable example of the genre I’ve ever read. His deliciously causidical prose is worth its weight in bandwidth: I suspect that every writer of these omnibus reviews is at some point tempted to call for a moratorium. Of course, such a call would go unheeded, and in its place I would like to urge a more realizable course of action: publishers and those who advise publishers should be made more aware of their responsibility to a reader’s time and money. They should not, for instance, be a party to the making of a book like Burton Weber’s The Construction of Paradise Lost (Souther Illinois). First of all, I am nowhere cited. But then neither are John Shawcross, Dennis Burden, Jon Lawry, Michael Wilding, John Reesing, Irene Samuel (Dante and Milton), A.B. Giamatti, Wayne Shumaker, Davis Harding, John Steadman, John Peter, Christopher Ricks, Arthur Barker, Northrop Frye, Anne Ferry, Frank Kermode, Bernard Bergonzi, Thomas Greene, Patrick Murray, Douglas Knight, Roy Daniels, Louis Martz, James Simms, and Thomas Kranidas, to name only a few. The reasons for these omissions (and others) is simple: Weber’s bibliography stops in 1962 even though his preface was written in December of 1970. This is disturbing on its face; it is even more disturbing in the context of his intention, which is nothing less than to resolve the points of issue in the Milton controversy. As everyone knows, however, that controversy did not end in 1962, and since 1962 the focus of the debate has shifted away fom the narrow polarization which dictates the shape of Weber’s arguments. I do not know why he ignores a decade of criticism, but even in the context of things as they were in 1962 his is a very weak book...</span></a></div>
