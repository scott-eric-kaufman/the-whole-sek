Remarkable. Think of the most clever pun you've ever read. Now multiply it by numbers. I imagine the author at work, staring at the blank screen, until suddenly, from nowhere, The Muse assaults him with an unthinking ferocity unknown outside legend and hyperbole. Unblinking, he longs longingly at his creation, his only wish that he could experience its birth again. The decision between slashes and parenthesis lingers in his loins. He feels the tingle spread as he remembers how gently he unpressed his shift and brought that slash to life. On the brink! It had been on the brink! For a moment the subtle curves of the parentheses had seduced him, but as he withdrew his pinkie he knew he had chosen wisely. In his loins. He knew in his loins he had chosen wisely. Like countless dead dinosaurs compressed in a diamond, his pun condensed his brilliance into sharp translucence. No one could encounter his pun and fail to acknowledge the awesomeness of the mind responsible for it. So he walked into the bathroom and beat off. THE END</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/06/a-lexigraphical.html"><span><strong>A Lexigraphical Lament about Probationer Prosody</strong> All scribes utilize lexicons. Roget's regnant tome monopolizes the matriculant market. Neophytes congregate in monograph outlets to procure a reprint. They disembark at their domicile and allocate Peter Roget's linguistical treatise a bearing on a transversal above their desktop computer. There it hunkers until a pedagogue implores them to formulate a polemic. Then the prentice wordsmith extracts it. The pupil employs it to ameliorate his pedestrian prose. With hubris he asseverates the eminence of his phraseological aptitude: &quot;My profiency with palaver is unparalleled. Scrutinize my incomparable prose if you don't accredit me!&quot; The ensuing evening his educator ensconces himself at his trestle to assess his august pupil's critique. After he appraises it he thrusts his extremities on his coutenance. He again cognizes that graduands should not be sanctioned to retain Roget's opus because proprietorship of aforementioned reprehensible receptacle of lexical surrogates elicits maximal keening from all preceptors. &quot;Why!&quot; the mentor declaims at his articulatory apex. &quot;Why must charges importune their prose with exorbitant diction?&quot; (This repost in honor of the wife, who has and will be spending far too much time grading of late and in the next few weeks.)</span></a></div>
