The University of California, will be staging events at its Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Diego campuses. SEK I understand, Great Wise One. I will prepare my students for the blaring sirens. They will learn to duck and protect their important bits. SEK enters the classroom at 9:30 a.m. SEK You are in grave danger! At precisely 10:00 a.m. this campus will be struck by an earthquake of unprecedented proportions! Sirens will blare and you will panic and die!

This means I now have a comment feed and, I'm told, my readers are already subscribed to it. That shouldn't have been done to you on my behalf.
