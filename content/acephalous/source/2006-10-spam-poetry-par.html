		<span id="comment-24204087-content"><p>LB, I always end up saying soem varient of the same thing, and you always end up taking me too literally, or something.  But isn&#39;t this more evidence for the coming &quot;Every Poetry Reader A Poet&quot;?</p>

<p>I mean, Scott wants to write poetry, so he cleverly puts together lines from spam, and you want to write poetry, so you do occasional parodies -- I haven&#39;t forgotten your three cats.  These provide plausible deniability -- you&#39;re &quot;not really a poet&quot;, especially in that horrible, way-uncool lyrical style; you don&#39;t take yourself too seriously, the crowning hipster sin.  But I don&#39;t really know why anyone who likes to read or hear poetry wouldn&#39;t want to also write or speak it.</p>

<p>And everyone can.  That&#39;s really the message of flarf, among so many other recent poetic styles, isn&#39;t it?  It&#39;s total democritization.  Which is not to say that aesthetics doesn&#39;t exist, or that poems are not good or bad, but that finally that isn&#39;t of primary importance to most people anymore.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-24206505-content"><p>Rich, sure, there&#39;s a democratizing movement going on in the poetry world from a variety of directions: (1) slam poetry; (2) creative writing courses; (3) flarf; (4) hip-hop and spoken word.  But I think the motivation behind each is quite different, and we have to take that into account.  Flarf, for instance, is a deliberate attempt to parasite onto the &quot;mainstream poetry&quot; world -- which is why Mike Magee calls this aleatory trash poetry &quot;mainstream poetry.&quot;  The not so hidden secret of the lyric/new-formal poetry scene is that, while the poets lash out against obscure or intellectual verse as anti-democratic, their scene itself is based on connections, glad-handing, favoritism, and so on.  </p>

<p>In the end, I don&#39;t think Flarf is great poetry.  It&#39;s basically a new form of dada, a big F-You to the New Yorker drivel that passes for poetry these days.  </p>

<p>But where the experimental poets do right is in the way they&#39;ve tried to democratize poetry.  They attack the whole &quot;genius&quot; discourse that&#39;s still rampant in a variety of forms: &quot;the poems write themselves,&quot; &quot;the poems are true to experience,&quot; &quot;I am not in control of my characters,&quot; and so on.  Instead, in the writing of folks like Perelman, Bernstein, Silliman, and others, we get an almost neo-classical attention to the poem as a made thing.  But unlike the poetry-workshop craft-as-therapy baloney, the avant folk are all about pushing craft into newer and newer territories.  </p>

<p>Of course, there are exceptions.  Jack Spicer articulated a notion of the poem coming from &quot;Outside,&quot; with the poet as antenna for language.  This returns in Nate Mackey&#39;s religious poetry.  But for the most part, the experimental poets have returned to language as stuff, as material, to be manipulated.  Even when a poet like Jackson Mac Lowe abdicates authorship by using computers to randomly deform language, the technology isn&#39;t seen as magical.  it&#39;s all about fumbling with language and finding new form.  That&#39;s why I hate the term &quot;new formalists&quot; for those idiots out there writing novels in sestinas or whatever.  That&#39;s retro nonsense, worse than The White Stripes.  The true new formalists are the Language and post-Language poets who have constructed new forms -- like Ron Silliman&#39;s &quot;new sentence.&quot;  </p>

<p>But you should read Ron Silliman&#39;s blog if you think poets no longer care about good or bad poetry.  The experimental poetry scene is one of the few places anymore where writers bring a deep and informed sense of the history of poetics to bear on poetry.  Flarf, true, is not about quality; it&#39;s about challenging the mainstream ideas of quality.  </p>

<p>Even with something like Flarf, though, there can be good and bad.  Just as there&#39;s good or bad free jazz or noise music.  Flarf poets might not be interested in the aesthetics of their flarf, but I can definitely decide between good and bad Bruce Andrews or Mac Lowe poetry.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t think the audience of poetry is simply the producers of poetry (or vice versa).  If anything, it&#39;s &quot;creative nonfiction&quot; that has become the &quot;anyone can do it&quot; genre of today.  You might be right that consumers of poetry are more likely to try their hand at producing poetry than, say, consumers of novels.  But I think that&#39;s more about the difference between poetry and fiction: people who like poetry are generally those who enjoy playing with language.  (Of course, storytellers love language too, but the demands of narrative basically define the extent to which you can play with language.  The more the storyteller distorts language, the more it comes off as poetry: *Finnegan&#39;s Wake* or passages of Burroughs and Kathy Acker, etc.) </p></span>

		<span id="comment-24206786-content"><p>Rich: Here&#39;s a recent Charles Bernstein poem that at times sounds like Flarf, but that is apparently remarkable poetry.  The mixture of silly and prophetic registers reminds me of Blake, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Blake&#39;s Songs were behind this one:</p>

<p>***********<br />
The Ballad of the Girlie Man (by Charles Bernstein)<br />
—For Felix</p>

<p><br />
The truth is hidden in a veil of tears<br />
The scabs of the mourners grow thick with fear<br />
A democracy once proposed<br />
Is slimmed and grimed again<br />
By men with brute design<br />
Who prefer hate to rime</p>

<p>Complexity&#39;s a four-letter word<br />
For those who count by nots and haves <br />
Who revile the facts of Darwin<br />
To worship the truth according to Halliburton</p>

<p>The truth is hidden in a veil of tears<br />
The scabs of the mourners grow thick with fear</p>

<p>Thugs from hell have taken freedom&#39;s store<br />
The rich get richer, the poor die quicker<br />
&amp; the only god that sanctions that<br />
Is no god at all but rhetorical crap</p>

<p>So be a girly man<br />
&amp; take a gurly stand<br />
Sing a gurly song<br />
&amp; dance with a girly sarong</p>

<p>Poetry will never win the war on terror<br />
But neither will error abetted by error</p>

<p>We girly men are not afraid<br />
Of uncertainty or reason or interdependence<br />
We think before we fight, then think some more<br />
Proclaim our faith in listening, in art, in compromise</p>

<p>So be a girly man<br />
&amp; sing this gurly song<br />
Sissies &amp; proud<br />
That we would never lie our way to war</p>

<p>The girly men killed christ<br />
So the platinum DVD says<br />
The Jews &amp; blacks &amp; gays<br />
Are still standing in the way</p>

<p>We&#39;re sorry we killed your god<br />
A long, long time ago<br />
But each dead solider in Iraq<br />
Kills the god inside, the god that&#39;s still not dead.</p>

<p>The truth is hidden in a veil of tears<br />
The scabs of the mourners grow thick with fear</p>

<p>So be a girly man<br />
&amp; sing a gurly song<br />
Take a gurly stand<br />
&amp; dance with a girly sarong</p>

<p>Thugs from hell have taken freedom&#39;s store<br />
The rich get richer, the poor die quicker<br />
&amp; the only god that sanctions that<br />
Is no god at all but rhetorical crap</p>

<p>So be a girly man<br />
&amp; sing this gurly song<br />
Sissies &amp; proud<br />
That we would never lie our way to war</p>

<p>The scabs of the mourners grow thick with fear<br />
The truth is hidden in a veil of tears</p></span>

		<span id="comment-24212933-content"><p>&quot;But you should read Ron Silliman&#39;s blog if you think poets no longer care about good or bad poetry.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, I didn&#39;t say that &quot;poets no longer care&quot;, because that isn&#39;t true.  I think that my original phrasing, &quot;that isn&#39;t of primary importance to most people anymore&quot;, is better.  Most people, I think, give most of their attention to their acquaintances, even though these community poets are manifestly not as good as those they could read more &quot;distantly&quot; either in time or in space.  Thus I still remember your three cats attack, or Scott&#39;s ode to his faux-tee, better than I remember many of the aesthetically better poems that I&#39;ve read in the interim.</p>

<p>I come out of the spoken word subculture mostly, though, so that of course colors my perception of what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>As for Silliman, I admire his objectives, but I&#39;m still not quite ready for direct engagement with langpo.  There&#39;s something about the self-conscious avant-garde that isn&#39;t really what I want -- all that &quot;almost neo-classical attention to the poem as a made thing [...] pushing craft into newer and newer territories&quot;, as if they are doing something different that no one before has ever done.  The next move in poetry, I think, is to accept that everything has been done, and then go on.  Bernstein&#39;s line &quot;Who prefer hate to rime&quot; is a case in point; no more poetry that alludes to writing poetry; it&#39;s time to stop being meta and just write.  At least, that&#39;s my mood for this week.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my almost-latest poem, in first draft, so that you can scorn it if you wish:</p>

<p><br />
Signals</p>

<p>When we were waiting in the line<br />
It passed hand to hand to hand<br />
The note<br />
&quot;Ten&quot; it read<br />
We looked at, up, eye to eye<br />
And waited<br />
For the branded bottles of water<br />
The flies<br />
The mold the crooked sign<br />
Unmoving</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s time to go&quot; he said at the bar<br />
&quot;Time to join up&quot;<br />
He would get a bonus<br />
His face gleamed<br />
Shiny, &quot;nothing else to do&quot;<br />
And the TV static<br />
Formed a nine, circled,<br />
Testing</p>

<p>He had a job<br />
Coordination<br />
The dismal flicker of eight<br />
On the CRT<br />
The flights sent<br />
Dropping people one-way<br />
Only digits came back<br />
&quot;Eight&quot; he Emailled<br />
Broadcast</p>

<p>&quot;Seven&quot; puffs the sky writing<br />
Over the assembled cameras<br />
The backdrop<br />
The camouflaged ranks<br />
The mike</p>

<p>They were well dressed<br />
Celebration signs waved decorously<br />
Conversationally<br />
&quot;We want the Rapture&quot;<br />
And others<br />
&quot;666 speeds the second coming&quot;<br />
Crosses<br />
And forward-looking smiles<br />
And a wind-blown sign tumbling<br />
With just one more six</p>

<p>&quot;Five&quot; whispered the voice on the phone line<br />
It was recorded<br />
Aren&#39;t they all?<br />
In a special file<br />
Played over and over<br />
Scanned for hidden messages<br />
&quot;Five&quot; it said &quot;five&quot;<br />
They let it alone<br />
There was so much else</p>

<p>&quot;Four&quot; he laughed crazy<br />
To the people at the nation&#39;s mall<br />
&quot;More years&quot; he laughed<br />
&quot;You all want more&quot;<br />
And they nodded,<br />
More</p>

<p>The radio said three chirpily<br />
In between the uncanny voices<br />
The time-old talk<br />
They had been talking from the beginning<br />
About three-fifths,<br />
Three fifths<br />
And how that was always<br />
Written, always should be</p>

<p>When all the LEDS <br />
On all the alarm clocks<br />
Blinked two endlessly<br />
The people<br />
Who were to have awoken that day<br />
Looked, groggy,<br />
Decided to get up, go on,<br />
Wanting it over with<br />
Wanting it the same</p>

<p>On the final day of that country<br />
The voice said One, everyone heard it<br />
&quot;One&quot; and they took out matches<br />
&quot;One&quot; and burned the books that told them they were good<br />
&quot;One&quot; and stumbled, footsore, into the wilderness</p>

		<span id="comment-24292793-content"><p>Been lurking for a while but am commenting for the first time.  Anyway, <a href="http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/hennessey/data/essays/sugarplum.htm" rel="nofollow">this article</a> is kind of old, but it&#39;s about how a spam poisoning program evidently produces (produced?) output greatly resembling L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry.  Kind of interesting that both spam poisoners and spammers are now producing gibberish.</p>

<p>Also, an <a href="http://www.metamute.com/look/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&IdPublication=1&NrIssue=28&NrSection=10&NrArticle=1388" rel="nofollow">article</a> about the politics behind found poetry created from spam.</p>

<p>The last paragraph of the 2nd article:</p>

<p>&quot;The recycling of spam e-mail into postmodern lyric is, from one angle, a symptom of this ‘extremist’ curtailment of negativity. The raw material comes from black-marketeers and fraudsters in countries that the US bombs or enslaves through financial debt; it ends up reinforcing the orthodox aesthetic ideology of the US avant-garde. It is negated by means of a strictly ironic détournement, which amounts to positive inclusion in a dominant poetic culture whose creed is Anti-Author. The interface is violent and preposterous. What western theoreticians of aesthetics are keen to be seen avoiding with sophisticated zeal – the rights of an author, authority for the English language in western society – is almost certainly something that the African ‘businessmen’ sitting in front of their keyboards in their IMF colonies are highly anxious to take for themselves. Spam is not there to be reordered magically into poetry. It is evidence of the desire of people to cheat capitalism and screw money out of gullible and greedy English-speakers. And for anyone unconcerned with the consumer rights of westerners and the parapolitical ideologies that make up their pedestal, that is poetry enough.&quot;</p></span>

Authorities are reluctant to speculate, but most believe the recent spate theoryfires were deliberately lit. 2005 had been the worst year on record for theoryfires, but this week’s blazes have experts fearing that 2006 may be even worse. The problem is especially severe in locations ravaged by drought. “The problem is we have extremely dry fuels,” said Capt. Dennis Whaling, head of the local Theoryfire Prevention Service (TPS). “Some wind and a few sparks and these tumbleweeds become bouncing molotov cocktails. We sent a TPS Report to everyone in Aletheia county urging people to dispose of stray tumbleweed properly, but it looks like no one got the memo.” Whaling and his staff scoff at the notions that 2005 theoryfires unconcealed enough brush to prevent another series of costly conflagrations. “All light, no heat,” Whaling said. Despite the lack of heat, the 2005 theoryfires unconcealed nearly 165,293 acres. Drought conditions in the months since have created a heavy fuel load. “You know have fast dead grass grows when it doesn’t rain,” said U.S. Philosophy Service spokeswoman Lisa Comerford. “But so long as there are no gusty windbags, our crews can build lines to prevent the theoryfires from jumping and causing too much damage,” she added. Shortly after midnight, Whaling’s team received a frantic call from Heath Campiglio, an amateur thinker who lives in a small community outside of Zzyzx, CA. “I was Being-in-the-Woods, minding my own business, when I saw something across Interstate 15,” Campiglio said. Aletheia County Theoryfirefighters responded immediately, but by the time they reached Zzyzx, the theoryfire had tripled in size. Around 7 a.m., Whaling redirected personnel to the theoryfire’s western boundary. Crews marched up a hillside and hiked a few miles inward, where they would use ready-to-hand tools to cut theoryfire lines. “We set up an antithesis here to keep this thing from spreading,” said Chandler Huxman, a volunteer theoryjumper from Bunkie, Louisiana. “If the theoryfire on the other side of the line crests this hill, it’s liable to synthesize the whole [expletive] county.” Local theoryfire experts like Martin Tillich believe that if Huxman and his theoryjumpers are unable to contain the Zzyzx blaze, it may consume the county’s only tourist attraction. “I don’t think the economy can handle the loss of our historic softwood forests,” said Tillich. “These Giant Sequoias were here before Plato, before Socrates. It would be a tragedy to lose them.” Tuesday’s gusty windbags have put them directly in harm’s way, Whaling said. By next Tuesday, a somber Tillich replied, “all that’s left of these sublime giants could be a burnt-out clearing.”</span></a></div>

One stands on a rock, bearing the President's &quot;strong, homely, humorous face, a look of loneliness in the eyes.&quot; Another has his &quot;hands clasped, palms down, thinking of his life, of his boyhood, of the past.&quot; Below the rock stands a &quot;long, ungainly figure of Lincoln, the boy, in a hunting-shirt, his hand resting on an ax-handle, one foot on a log, a serious figure, in the brief pause from labor, considering with quiet, lineless face the future, as above him the complete [men] regarded an heroic past.&quot; After assaying the sculptor's &quot;realization&quot; of Keats' poem, the scholar—who, at the moment, ismaking love to the sculptor's beautiful but lame patron—insults the &quot;broken-backed chair&quot; with &quot;one cracked leg strengthened with twine and a splint of wood&quot; performing the duty of a pedestal: &quot;Why did you put it on that hideous stool? It is very beautiful, but the chair spoils it. It is like putting a beautiful head on a distorted body.&quot; His beloved's beautiful head swivels on its distorted body and everyone—Lincolns included—hyperventilates in horror. What happened here? So glad you asked: You see, the sculptor swerved to avoid a strangely familiar disabled lady toddling across the interstate, slammed Ekphrasis-first into a parked Keats, looked behind him, gasped at the fleet of Lincolns bearing down on him and jumped from his ride just as the Great Emancipators began pounding it one model year after another after another after another. His friends—who were following him but had been stranded by a red light the sculptor roared through—pull up, scream in disbelief, then follow a trail of blood across some well-manicured wilderness. They quickly find the sculptor and his shaken patron deep in conversation about this transitory life—which they compare, unfavorably, to aesthetic immortality of the type enshrined in poesy. Keats, Lincoln and how to keep Nature looking its most natural occupy the company until the scholar, crushing hard on his beloved, interrupts the gay proceedings with a thoughtless remark about the &quot;lame&quot; turn the conversation has taken, and everyone—dead Lincolns too—hyperventilates in horror. What? You have a better explanation?</span></a></div>
