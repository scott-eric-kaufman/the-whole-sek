You would think that having lived in Southern California for a decade, I would be emotionally equipped to handle forest fires. I have, after all, dealt with them before. But those fires were &quot;in my vicinity,&quot; and the worst element of each was the effect the resulting air quality had on my wife's lungs. This fire, while not nearly so dangerous as those, was actually &quot;near me.&quot; I'm talking consider-the-view-from-my-apartment-near-me: I took that picture after returning home from the teaching gig that I have to wake up at 5 a.m. in order to commute to. I was informed that I might need to evacuate at a moment's notice at approximately 7:45 p.m. on Thursday. I started packing the car almost immediately, but kept having to sit down and force myself to breathe or I would've had a full-fledged panic attack (just in case you were wondering when I was on Facebook). Part of the panic emanated from your typical what-to-take debate: running around the apartment evaluating the relative worth of Item X versus Item Y. As the night progressed, however, I became increasingly concerned that my evaluations were too much about me. My wife is currently in Italy, where it was then currently the middle of the night. I became haunted by the possibility that I was selecting items of marginal value to me over items of intense value to her. So I started having to think like her—to look at our life through her eyes—the result of which was that I felt (and still feel) profoundly close to a sleeping woman half the world away. Nothing makes a person ache for the woman he's loved for over than decade more than an adrenalin-fueled tour of that time. But then another possibility started dogging my thoughts: the potential for there to be something of hers that my forgetting (or remembering but valuing less than this other thing) would appear evidence of a diminished love. Against my will—not to mention knowledge of her character—scenarios arose in which she became distraught upon learning that I had neglected to save her wedding dress but remembered the Kitchen Aid mixer. So after having been at this for hours I began a desperate attempt to a contact a sleeping woman on the other side of the world with no cell and sketchy internet access. As the night deepened, exhaustion vied with adrenalin in a toxic combat that severely impaired my judgment. I thought it perfectly acceptable to hijack her Facebook account and contact Italian friends I thought could maybe get in touch with the people staying up the road from her. It didn't even seem like a good idea at the time: I was simply that desperate. What had begun as a feeling of deep reconnection with my wife became, as night turned to morning, a fear of a future condemnation by her so fundamental it would kill the marriage. In my mind there came to exist a singular object so...</span></a></div>
