<p>Strange artifacts from another era that Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie already seemed, the few other selections available at the time ranged immediately downwards through choices such as <i>Bewitched</i>, and quickly plunging to the depths of <i>F Troop</i>, <i>Gilligan&#39;s Island</i>, and <i>McHale&#39;s Navy</i>.</p>

<p>Tv really <i>was</i> rather a vast wasteland in those days.</p>

<p><i>TDVDS</i>, though, would seem to be the first example of a tv series (that&#39;s half about) about doing a tv series.  I could be forgetting or unaware of a precursor, to be sure.  </p>

<p>As usual, I digress.</p></span>

Never watched much of the show (just can&#39;t get into cringe comedy) &amp; it&#39;s getting harder (for me, anyway) to differentiate between film &amp; HD digital recording. I&#39;d almost bet money that even if it&#39;s film, it&#39;s transferred to a digital medium for editing &amp; broadcast. </p>

<p>To answer NutellaOT, when I interned in local broadcast television (at the dawn of time) someone had to control the camera output from the control room. The two things we had to watch were the &quot;iris,&quot; &amp; the &quot;pedestal,&quot; which was sort like the black level, or brightness, &amp; had to be kept w/in certain levels to conform to FCC broadcasting regs. So in video, at least, it&#39;s called the iris.</p></span>

<p>As far as shows about shows go, certainly Jack Benny, at least on television (&amp; I&#39;d imagine on the radio) was almost as much about doing the show (or about dealng w/ or obtaining the services of the guest star) as the show itself. </p>

<p>Not to the level of DVanD (I don&#39;t remember many meetings about the script w/ the producer &amp; writers in Benny shows) but it often seemed that half the Benny show was comedy leading up the guest&#39;s act.</p></span>

<p>Also, something I was thinking about later... wouldn&#39;t a wide angle lens distort things differently in different parts of the picture?  I would think towards the center things would appear further apart than normal and towards the edges they&#39;d be closer together, like the opposite of a map of the globe.  This could still create the described effect as long as you framed the shot properly.  Of course, that is taking &quot;exaggerating the distance&quot; to mean making it larger.</p>

<p>On a globe, you&#39;re forcing an object of smaller surface area (a sphere) onto an object with a larger surface area (a rectangle).  A wide angle lens takes more information and compresses it onto a smaller area and, given the radiating nature of optics, this is more true on the edges of a shot than in the center.  Again, I could be making this all up.</p></span>

Using the short/wide-angle lens means that the camera has to be a lot closer to the scene.  There is less stuff in between subject and camera, or subject.  Etymologically, it is more &quot;im-mediate&quot;.</p>

<p>Less abstractly, the feel of a short lens is more like being in the scene yourself.  In the still posted above, for Kenneth to turn and leave the scene, he will have to move in such a way as to miss the camera itself.  If the camera were 35 feet away with a long lens, he could leave by walking across the camera&#39;s field of vision or something, basically erasing the idea that the camera is a physical presence in the space where the scene is taking place.  Which is to say that I disagree with (and don&#39;t really understand) the assertion that wide-angle cameras &quot;do the opposite.&quot;</p>

<p>Other points:<br />
1. Wide-angle lenses do not have a shallower DOF than long lenses.  It&#39;s all but equal.<br />
2. Large apertures/open irises/whatev. create a shallow DOF.<br />
3. Large apertures don&#39;t change contrast, so much as they create proper exposure of the film.  If the alternative is &quot;underexposed&quot;, well, then, yeah, proper exposure increases contrast.  (Actually, re-reading the article, this cinematographer has push-processed this film stock to increase contrast on other projects; this means under-exposing it, then over-developing.  This would mean using a smaller aperture/iris and over-development to increase contrast.  On 30 Rock, he says that he adds contrast in post-production, if needed.)<br />
4. There&#39;s a contradiction in your argument.  In one paragraph, you say that wide angle lenses create a shallow DOF and that a large iris does the same; in the next paragraph you say that wide-angle lenses create a deeper DOF and the large iris counteracts that.  (Neither claim about the length of the lens is true, at least in any significant way; but you contradict yourself.)</p>

<p>And nutella on toast has it backwards.  The distortion is greatest at the edges and corners of the frame; minimal in the center.  But correct that the distortion varies in different parts of the frame -- or, more precisely, in different parts of the &quot;coverage&quot; of the lens.  (Now I&#39;m getting really geeky, so I&#39;ll stop.)</p>

<p>1. That contradiction belongs to the cinematographer: I&#39;m paraphrasing him right before the quotation, in part because I didn&#39;t think he was correct.</p>

<p>2. Please don&#39;t stop.  This is exactly the sort of technical information I was looking for!  </p>

<p>Everyone else:</p>

<p>More on the show-within-a-show theme later, but one quick question: to your knowledge, do any of those shows also include network executives as main characters?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef012877b5838a970c-content"><p>Okay, actually, now that I&#39;ve re-read the article again, the cinematographer doesn&#39;t actually talk about the focal lengths the uses AT ALL. (By focal length, I mean terms like wide-angle, short lens, long lens, telephoto.)</p>

<p>The specific claim that precedes the quoted material is that he uses a small aperture to create a shallow DOF because the backdrops outside the windows need to be out of focus. A side benefit of this -- in my reading of the article -- is that it gives a &quot;documentary&quot; feel. The shooting resembles, in some ways, available-light documentary films. (High-speed stock, large apertures, and a camera that is physically part of the same space as the subjects.)</p>

<p>Now, the choice of short lenses might be part of the documentary aesthetic, or it might be a product of the same practical concerns that led to its use in documentary filmmaking -- shooting in small spaces. Or both. But nothing in the article touches on the focal length questions.</p>

<p>In any case, you are correct that short lenses might make somebody&#39;s head look bigger.</p></span>

We here at Lawyers, Guns and Money are solidly in the Roman Polanski belongs in prison camp, but we are also rank pedants, and the following sentence is something up with which we shall not put:When Franz Kafka wrote “The Metamorphosis” he may have had someone like Roman Polanski in mind.Because Jeffrey Jena is a very serious thinker who &quot;has been seen on Murder, She Wrote, Hunter, appeared in shows with Jenny McCarthy and Weird Al Yankovic and in several films including Raising the Dead with Allison Eastwood,&quot; we must consider the implications of this literary reference very seriously, as there is no chance he inserted it solely to make people think he reads important books. Jena's complaint is that, much like Gregor Samsa in Kafka's novel, Roman Polanski rapes children—only Samsa did nothing of the sort. Let us try again: Jena's complaint is that, much like Gregor Samsa in Kafka's novel, Roman Polanski awoke one morning to find himself transformed into einem ungeheueren Ungeziefer, a monstrous vermin—only that would absolve Polanski of moral responsibility for his crimes, as he had no hand in his transformation and, more importantly, no one expects monstrous vermin to abide by human law. Jena's complaint must be that, like Gregor Samsa, Roman Polanski is not being treated by the Swiss courts in the manner their American counterparts treated John Wayne Gacy, who murdered thirty-three people—only that makes no sense at all. We are officially stumped. We have no clue what Jena hoped to accomplish by dropping that reference. Unless: [Pierce] Brosnan went on to say that in order to work with Mr. Polanski, “You have to know your onions.” I am not really sure what that means but it tells us two things about Mr. Brosnan, he’s not great with metaphors and he may be a little dense. Brosnan is the poster boy for the term “limousine liberal.” He claims to have become an American citizen during what he terms “the atrocity of the Bush years” to help his family “endure the hypocrisy and stupidity of the man’s power.” His power is stupid? His power is filled with hypocrisy? How do you figure that?Of course! Jena was priming the Pump of Irony. Had he not dropped in a completely random, utterly irrelevant reference in that first sentence, readers may have breezed over his criticism of Brosnan without realizing how ironic it is when someone with Jena's linguistic facility criticizes someone else for mouthing an infelicitous metaphor. We're not sure whether we should thank him or file this away with all the other examples of cultural conservatives whose knowledge of the culture they aim to conserve is as wide and deep as a playa lake.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/02/we-is-a-serious-news-organization-what-demands-you-retract-tweets-now.html"><span><strong>We is a serious news organization what demands you retract tweets now.</strong> The following sentence actually appears in a post on the site of a darling of conservative media:We have identified yet another tweet we would like [Roger Ebert] to retract[.] The &quot;yet another&quot; is delicious, as it indicates that Andrew Breitbart has initiated a campaign to compel people to retract their tweets. The vicious slur of a tweet in question reads: Breitbart's bright bulbs know that's a lie:We have established that we differ on the last sentence, but his claim he did not know that “teabaggers” is a pornographic term until the MSM (mainstream media) told him is provably false. We know it’s false because in 1998, Prof. Ebert reviewed a film containing this scene[.]How can you not respect a corporate non-entity who insists on granting Ebert a doctorate for the sole purpose using &quot;Prof.&quot; as a diminutive? More to the point: how can you not pity the poor Breitbart intern who, I hope, is pretending to misunderstand Ebert's patently sarcastic remark in order to score points with his boss? Because that's what this all adds up to: some minion being forced to impersonate a tweet-retracting mountain camel in order to impress Andrew Breitbart. Because this is what impresses Andrew Breitbart: the retraction of tweets in which people call tea-baggers by the doubly ignorant name they chose for themselves.* The demand to stop calling tea-baggers the name they gave themselves is, remarkably, not the dumbest part of this tweet-retraction crusade: that would be the faux-outrage Pam Meister musters upon learning that Ebert's tweets don't rise to the level of &quot;informed commentary.&quot; She suggests, with a straight face, that the lack of sustained commentary by Ebert is a grave failure of character, not a feature inherent in the Twitter's 140 character limit; and she does this, of course, without acknowledging the vast archive of his writing freely available online. Granted, Meister might not be any better acquainted with Google than her fellow tea-baggers, but the point remains: she thinks Ebert should write tweets with more characters than Twitter allows, and until he does, she will be very, very cross with him. Which is terrible, terrible news, as the odds of someone as soft as Ebert weathering this tweet-retraction campaign are slim indeed. *They can pull down their site in an effort to deny it, but Google remembers that they were the ones who started using &quot;tea-bag&quot; as a verb, so they need to live with the consequences of their laziness and sexual stolidity. Liberals didn't claim the Founding Fathers threw tea-bags into Boston Harbor, nor were they the ones who insisted on compounding the error of that anachronism by naming their movement without performing a precautionary Googling. For a movement so concerned with personal responsibility, you'd think someone in it might take some.</span></a></div>
