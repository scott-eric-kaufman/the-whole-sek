			<p>This post concerns an Umberto Eco essay published in the Spring, 1972 volume of <em>Diacritics</em> entitled</p>

<center><img src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/mythofsuperman.jpg" /></center>

<p>Or perhaps this post was an excuse to publish the title of article as <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0300-7162%28197221%292%3A1%3C14%3ATMOS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-5">printed</a> in the Spring, 1972 volume of <em>Diacritics</em>.&nbsp; (As the Jews say: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayenu"><em>dayenu</em></a>.)&nbsp; This essay's been on my mind since I read Scott McLemee's &quot;<a href="http://insidehighered.com/views/2007/10/10/mclemee">Good Grief</a>&quot; (about Eco's &quot;The World of Charlie Brown&quot;), as evidenced by the following two dreams:</p>

<p><strong>Dream #1: The Lamest Mutant Power Ever</strong></p>

<p>Namely, the power to create and pop corn kernels with my mind.&nbsp; Attempts to propel myself into the sky on an ascending slide of popping corn (<em>a la </em><a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/05aug/01264/images/Iceman.gif">Iceman</a>) failed.&nbsp; My attempt to stop a large object (a Buick) with a wall of popped corn met with similar &quot;success.&quot;&nbsp; When my friends disappeared—presumably off to fight real criminals with their real powers—I amused myself by hitting the street and creating, then popping, corn kernels in the mouths of unsuspecting pedestrians.&nbsp; I took great pleasure in watching their faces contort to the tune of bug-in-my-mouth, then relax when the kernel hit their tongue.&nbsp; They had no clue where this popcorn came from, and only one or two broke stride to search for a potential source.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The dream didn't &quot;end&quot; so much as &quot;stop&quot; when I became bored with the endless iteration of the same, or what Eco calls &quot;a typical high redundance message [which] informs us of very little and which, on the contrary ... keeps hammering home the same meaning which we have peacefully acquired upon reading the first work in the series.&quot;&nbsp; (Or, in my case, from popping the first kernel in the mouth of a stranger.)&nbsp; I took comfort in the known and sated my &quot;hunger for redundance.&quot;&nbsp; My complacence prevented me from realizing the potential my power held.</p>

<p>Like Superman, who &quot;carries on his activity on the level of the small community where he lives (Smallville as a youth, Metropolis as an adult),&quot; I ignored everything outside the borders of the dream city in which I lived.&nbsp; Because I couldn't fight crime, I felt impotent.&nbsp; The fact that I could conjure food stuff from thin air disappointed me.&nbsp; Not only did I not want to feed the world, the thought never even occurred to me, because &quot;the only visible form that evil assumes is an attempt on private property.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Eco pegged the lameness of my unimaginative dream-hero. </p>

<p><strong>Dream #2: The Lamest Article Ever</strong><br /> </p>

<p>Contrary to the claims of Dream #1 and Eco, the Superman myth concerns issues other than the protection of the propertied classes from miscreants who place illegitimate claims on their stuff.&nbsp; In point of fact, the latest big-screen iteration, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348150/"><em>Superman Returns</em></a>, is Bryan Singer's allegorical critique of the neoconservative movement generally and the Bush Administration in particular.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Such, 
at least, was the argument I forwarded in an article published in <em>n+1</em> at times, <em>American Literature</em> at others.
&nbsp; As explained to the audience attending my talk, in the article I argued something about planes falling from the sky that can only be caught in baseball diamonds by <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/10/11/2006_superman_returns_040_2.jpg">dashing bureaucrats</a>.&nbsp; I said something about the disappearance of Bushes and Cheneys during Clinton's eight years being analogous to Clark Kent's disappearance, inasmuch as both sought to reconnect with their origins and discover who they are.&nbsp; And I closed with a stirring reading of Superman tossing Lex Luthor's mid-Atlantic crystal continent into space when he learned it would bring death to England and America alike.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Which is to say: I forwarded the stunningly sophisticated argument that Bush/Superman would lift Iraq/Luther's poisonous-crystal-continent ... and hurl it into the sun.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For this brilliant argument I was awarded a place of honor in <em>n+1 </em>or <em>American Literature</em> (depending) and a keynote address before an enthusiastic crowd at the best-attended conference in the history of academia.&nbsp; (When I looked up from the podium the crowd stretched over the horizon.)&nbsp; </p>

<p>Eco inspired the lameness of my unimaginative dream-scholar.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t listen B&amp;S into the ground.  They will rise again more powerful than ever. (I really only inculded the self-indulgent link because I made a mix for a friend recently and type the phrase without the music playing in my head.)</p>

Telling. Fellow conservative bloggers should shame her into participating or refusing to. The lack of actual engagement between the right and left is something to be mourned, not celebrated, lest we end up with people spouting unconscionably general nonsense like: Unfortunately once the facts reach the ears of a liberal they automatically become violent and attack those that defy their world view verbally and at ever increasing intervals with physical violence. No wonder Malkin fears facts. (Frankly, I'm a little worried myself now.) But the real joy in reading Malkin's commentariat comes from all those suffering from Sudden Onset Poetry Syndrome. Someone'll be vitrioling along then LIGHTNING STRIKES! and they're channeling William Blake (or a reasonable approximation of him): Ezra Klein? Never heard of him. Is a response necessary? The eagle does not do battle with the fly. The eagle also never loses so much time as when he submits to learn from the crow. And the eagle bites weasel. Weasel bites back. They fly up to nowhere. Then in and out the eagle, and pop goes the weasel. But the beetle implores the eagle. The eagle brushes him aside. After the eagle leaves, the beetle smashes all his eggs. Q.E.D.</span></a></div>

I mean, you (mostly*) stuck with me as I chatted with Adam and John on Friday night and Saturday morning, but you abandoned me as I strode toward the front of the Walnut Room and introduced myself to James Wood. Like, seriously dude—seriously—what was up with that? I was convinced that walking up to him and telling he was completely misreading William Gass was a good idea. You should've been there, you know, to tell me that Wood would've listened politely for about thirty seconds before shuffling away from the garrulous guy with the evident chip on his shoulder. You would've consoled me. Told me I was right and didn't need to prove it to anybody. Instead, you were, well, where were you? In the room, reading Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell? Mourning the Tigers' loss? Watching Boston break its own heart? Seriously, I needed you tonight, but you were &quot;too busy&quot; to keep my mouth in check. It followed my brain. Now I'm an ass. I mean, Opportunistic Careerism stood by me, so hopefully Wood'll remember the name emblazoned on my name tag instead of the one I proffered. (What's the worst that can happen? Wood can't have John caned now, can he?) Still, I'm upset you deserted me, and continue to do so. Don't you know what time it is? No one with you would still be awake, yet here I am, watching Matt Damon foil the best laid plans of mousy bureaucrats ... Yours, SEK *I've been told never to repeat that story. I mean, I'd already been told not to, but now I have independent verification that it's not the sort of story I should tell.</span></a></div>
