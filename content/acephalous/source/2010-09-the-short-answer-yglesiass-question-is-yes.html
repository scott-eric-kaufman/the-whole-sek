			<p>But as I&#39;m incapable of short answers, let me provide a slightly longer one.  In <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/09/if-a-working-paper-falls-in-the-wilderness-and-a-journalist-hears-about-it-is-that-worse/">this post</a>, Yglesias shares his experience of having learned that</p>

And not simply  in the sense that doing less research and more publicizing is punished; I  was told that holding research output constant, getting more publicity  for your output would be <em>harmful</em> to a junior scholar’s career because it would feed an assumption of non-seriousness.</p>

<p>It is.  I won&#39;t speak for political science as a discipline, but I  can speak to the problem as it exists in mine.  The basic logic is that  sharing work with the general public is a means of circumventing the  &quot;serious&quot; peer review process, and as such is necessarily &quot;unserious.&quot;   The problem with that explanation is that the peer review process is  itself <a href="http://tenured-radical.blogspot.com/2010/08/journal-isms-what-would-it-take-to.html">a monument to unseriousness</a>:</p>

<p>The other downside to publishing exclusively in journals that live  behind pay-walls is that, while the articles contained therein are  totally serious, <em>no one ever reads them</em>.  As my advisor once told  me, if I want an idea to die, the best thing to do is publish it in a  flagship journal.  He wasn&#39;t being serious, obviously, but neither was  he being completely unserious.  To paraphrase what I believe <a href="http://michaelberube.com/">this fellow</a> once told me, but which I can&#39;t seem to locate, my discipline&#39;s flagship journal is treated like issues of <em>The New Yorker</em>:  they live next to the toilet or in a pile forever awaiting the day in  which we have nothing else to read.  It&#39;s prestigious to be published in  it, but it&#39;s a means to be hired or promoted, not start a conversation.</p>
<p>It hasn&#39;t <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/theorys_empire__1.html">always been this way</a>—or,  at the very least, we once made a concerted effort to appear  otherwise—but as it currently stands, the choice is between being a  &quot;serious&quot; scholar who engages no one or an &quot;unserious&quot; scholar whose  work is read by many but, because of that, counts for nothing.  I&#39;m  obviously not endorsing this model, nor am I saying it&#39;s the same in all  disciplines, as I would love to be in a discipline in which my work  mattered on its merits rather than for what its publication wins me;  however, for those invested in the system as it&#39;s currently constituted,  the idea of public engagement is understandably frightening.  After  all, if you&#39;ve spent decades advancing up the tenure ladder by never  being read, a situation in which your work might be read <em>and evaluated</em> could result in people judging—and determining whether you deserve—your ostensibly illustrious career.</p>
<p>Only, <em>no</em>.  That&#39;s the fear, but far from the reality.  If you scroll through the <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/dissertation/page/2/">many, many pages</a> I tagged &quot;dissertation,&quot; what you see is a community of very useful  people helping me develop my ideas on a daily basis.  (Twenty-four  comments about Edith Wharton&#39;s <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/02/edith-wharton-g.html">understanding, or lack thereof, of heliocentrism</a>?  How is that <em>not</em> useful?)  So, one of the reasons behind not sharing non-peer-reviewed work  with the general public is simply misguided fear; the other is that its  difficult to be gatekeepers when there&#39;s no gate, even though the road  to it and through it currently resembles <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/world/asia/04briefs-TRAFFIC.html">a Chinese traffic jam</a>.*</p>
<p>I&#39;ve strayed a little far from Yglesias&#39;s question, but I think a  detour into the internal logic of academic publication is necessary to  understand why its &quot;serious&quot; fruits must be kept in a closely guarded  garden.  There&#39;s a lot more to be said about this, obviously, but given  that Yglesias was identifying the nuttiness of the situation among  political scientists, I think it&#39;s best to stop before my reasoning  becomes too discipline-specific. Accordingly, I&#39;m interested in learning  whether a similar situation obtains in other humanities disciplines, as  I long ago learned that scientists and engineers actually read each  others&#39; work.</p>
<p>*Am I the only one who sees that becoming a metaphor for something sooner rather than later?</p>
<p>[<em>Edited to reflect the fact that it&#39;s rude to call people you only  think you know because you&#39;ve been reading them for years by their first  names.</em>]</p>

<p>As it has developed, one of the functions of the university is to define a technocratic elite group. (Something like that has always been a function of the university, and this is a specific form of it.) </p>

<p>For this to work, there has to be a bright line. PhDs and ful professors can&#39;t just be people who know the same kinds of things as  normal people, but just know more things and know them better. They have to know things that the normal person is incapable of understanding and will automatically reject. If normal people can understand what you&#39;re saying, you&#39;re doing it wrong.</p>

<p>One of the themes of the book on populism Gellner edited ca. 1970 was &quot;Everyone knows about populism, but know one can say what it is&quot;. Tentative answers were proposed. According to Laclau (&quot;On populist reason&quot;) the situation hadn&#39;t changed 30-odd years later.</p>

<p>The answer is this. &quot;Populism&quot; is a constitutive social-science concept. Not the outcome of social science investigation and analysis, but one of the always-already-theres of social science. The populist is the non-social-scientist who thinks that he knows something about reality, and he is the bitter enemy of the social scientist, since if it were possible for non-social-scientists to know anything, or to understand social scientists, what good would those PhDs be?</p>

<p>That shown, I&#39;d just like to point out that Ivy League whiz kids of the Yglesian type just have gone through four years of constant association with academics of the social science type. (Throw in philosophers and literary studies technicians). They&#39;ve been trained like dogs to be incapable of communicating with or understanding what the folk have to say. Is it really a good idea for the Democratic Party and liberal opinion magazines to hire persons of this type?</p></span>

So, like, animals studies is the hot thing, and likely to remain so for, oh, another 6 months or so. From 2006 on (I think), I shared tons of work from my diss. on In the Middle, to my benefit: whatever&#39;s cool or interesting in it is because I was trying to have it make sense/be interesting in a blog world. For anyone who&#39;s into medieval studies, and critical animal theory, I&#39;m just a google search away.</p>

<p>And then I published an article on a the subject in a pretty good, theory intensive medieval journal. Took a year and a half to come out, but it came out. And I thought: this is IT. Now people are REALLY going to read me. And then I got cited in the flagship (toilet reading) journal by a guy who&#39;s a big deal medieval scholar. COOL. This is IT. Finally.</p>

<p>This story wouldn&#39;t be worth telling if it didn&#39;t have a some peripeteia. At a flagship medieval conference this summer, I attended 3 (three) of 4 (four) sessions on medieval lit and critical animal theory and I was cited 0 (zero) times. Uh. This isn&#39;t because my work wasn&#39;t relevant or interesting to the subject at hand. It was, and it is. </p>

<p>It suggests that not only does no one read our work: WE don&#39;t read our work. When my book comes out next year, I fully expect it to be swallowed up into library stacks, and my tenure and promotion, and to represent nothing OTHER than a steady job and years and years of work.</p>

<p>Thank goodness for the blog.</p></span>

Sure. Matt Y&#39;s a good writer and he doesn&#39;t have an advanced degree. If that&#39;s the type you mean. </p>

<p>And, as the review essays in the The Nation show, there&#39;s a market (however small) for intelligent writing by academics for non-specialists (I think of Samuel Moyn or Eric Foner&#39;s many, many pieces over the last few years, none of which I thought was stupid).</p>

<p>My point is that it&#39;s not just that the &#39;common man&#39; doesn&#39;t read us. He doesn&#39;t read ANYONE. So whatever: I don&#39;t feel singled out. It&#39;s that WE don&#39;t read each other. A few people get read, but the average journal article is cited how many times? Twice? If that?</p></span>

<p>is not noticeably different from the staffing of the Republican Party apparat, in socioeconomic terms. They grow up in a different rhetorical tradition, though. Seriously, Emerson, I didn&#39;t think you were the sort who drew lines through a single data point.</p>

<p>Karl, under those circumstances, I don&#39;t think there&#39;d be anything remiss with sending the panelists a link after the conference with the traditional self-deprecating &quot;you might be interested&quot; note. (In my case, a majority of the people who might cite my stuff probably read it during peer-review: it&#39;s a small world.)</p></span>

<p>Not being noticeably different than Republican Party staffing is not in any way a positive thing. The Republican party is supposed to be the defender of privilege.</p>

<p>As far as the Republican Party goes, though, boss man Karl Rove had one year of college at Utah, and the Republicans get a lot of staff from semi-criminal College Republicans from shit colleges. (Do I think that the Democrats should hire more semi-criminal types? Yes! -- though that would not be enough all by itself. During its glory days there were a fair number of thugs in the Democratic Party).</p></span>

My complaint is that since virtually no one&#39;s going to read it, all it&#39;s going to get me is a steady job. If I just wanted a steady job, I could have got that just about anywhere. No need to belabor the point of why speaking into nothing for $ might annoy.</p>

<p>In re: Yglesias: there&#39;s a standard argument about Yglesias, Drum, and Klein, which has been done repeatedly at Sadly No. I don&#39;t see the need to recap it here. <a href="http://www.talkleft.com/story/2010/9/3/223016/8188" rel="nofollow">Here&#39;s a nice new version of the argument, though, in re: American Taliban.</a></p>

<p>@Ahist: nah, no point, unless they&#39;re about to publish. At that point, through peer review comments, they might figure out I exist, Or they won&#39;t. I&#39;ll just keeping plugging along. Next thing to come out, btw, is <a href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/pmed/archive/2011_issues.html" rel="nofollow">this.</a> At least I&#39;ll not be read in esteemed company. </p>

<p>@JE: The difference isn&#39;t the wan temperament of those with Ivy degrees (and here I speak as an Ivy PhD) and cf&#39;d to uneducated oafs like Limbaugh, Beck, Palin, and Rove, or folks with third-rate doctorates like Gingrich. The Dem establishment can&#39;t make a populist appeal bc a populist appeal from the left requires a systemic critique of capitalism, whereas a populist critique from the right supports capitalism, since anything that makes workers more vulnerable and paranoid and atomized saps their capacity to self-organize. Therefore one populist critique is not like the other. So long as both parties are beholden to big business, there will be no establish Dem populist critique. This reliance on big business and big money is especially evident in the Senate; one is much more likely to find someone like Feingold in the House than in the Senate, whereas populist rightists increasingly dominate the Republican house and senate. Thus Yglesias&#39;s and Klein&#39;s frequent criticism of the Senate and calls for its abolishment go a long way towards fixing one problem with American &quot;democracy.&quot; </p></span>

<p>There&#39;s a middle term between the Ivy League and morons. </p>

<p>As I said, &quot;It isn&#39;t the only reason&quot;. Hiring Ivies and being bought by the corporate world are hand in glove. The media / politico elite is being drawn from an increasingly narrow pool of privileged kids who, even though they might feel squirrelly about corporate dominance, have no concept of how to resist it. </p>

<p>Beyond saying that the word populist, as used, remains undefined, I&#39;d say that some usages are just wrong. A lot of today&#39;s supposed populists are goldbugs, for example. The billionaire Koch brothers are populists. Ridiculous. &quot;Populist&quot; has to mean something more than and other than &quot;anti-intellectual and racist&quot;. The word has become a pejorative, with the worst traits of the worst populists cherry-picked to define the word. xx</p></span>

No kidding?</p>

<p><i>Maybe don&#39;t try to present anything at Tulane for a little while.</i><br />
Wasn&#39;t planning on it.</p>

<p><i>Beyond saying that the word populist, as used, remains undefined, I&#39;d say that some usages are just wrong.</i><br />
That is true. How do you define it?<br />
I imagine we all read the same blogs: Digby&#39;s recent post on a left populist agenda perhaps answers some of your concerns. For another viewpoint, there&#39;s a Zizek piece in I think The New Left Review from 2008 or so: can&#39;t handily track it down, but I&#39;m sure you could.</p>

<p>My point, again, is that a right wing mass movement* has the support of the powers that be among the Republicans. Any left wing mass movement has not and will not have the support of the powers that be among the Democrats. This is because leftist mass movements engage in a systemic critique of capitalism, whereas rightist mass movements, at least as they&#39;ve appeared in this country--so far as I know!--serve the aims of capitalism. This is why I think we&#39;re doomed (and by &#39;we&#39; I mean leftists, academics, and the assorted others the right wants eliminated). </p>

<p>Note: <a href="http://twitter.com/KarlSteel/statuses/22351641784" rel="nofollow">I&#39;ve said elsewhere that the belief that changing American demographics will save the Democrats is this year&#39;s Bowen/Sosa report.</a></p>

<p>* will you accept this as a placeholder for &quot;populism&quot;? at least until your definition comes around the mountain?</p></span>

No signs. FLAGS. From a rhetorical standpoint, listing the banned item before the desired one gives the impression that you’re more concerned with stopping people from bringing the former than encouraging them to bring the latter. To wit: NO CHILD RAPISTS AT BILLY FOURTH YEAR BIRTHDAY PARTY — GRANDMAS! **STICKY POST** Write that and people will not only assume that some members of your audience want to bring a pedophile to a young boy’s birthday party, but that they will do so unless specifically told not to. What does that say about how you feel about your audience? It says that you believe they lack common sense, that they might not only consider bringing a pedophile to the party, but that they might even think it’s a good idea. At the very least, you suggest that your audience might think of bringing a pedophile before a grandma, which means you think they think more about pedophiles than grandmas. As if to prove you think they’re scum, you decide to “sticky” a post ten days in advance of the event and implore people to “get the word out now,” because you think that if your audience isn’t constantly reminded not to bring pedophiles to the party, some members of it will. Then—presumably because you feel your audience has been insufficiently insulted—you follow that title with a post whose tone flits between pleading and hectoring: Robert and I respectfully request that those of you who will be attending Billy’s fourth year birthday bring grandmas, not pedophiles [...] Please get the word out now [...] We are asking that we all respect and honor that day with the grandmas, great-grandmas, other people’s grandmas.. lots of grandmas…PLEASE don’t bring pedophiles [...] It is a happy day. No pedophiles. GRANDMAS. Why would you write that? Because you know that more than a few pedophiles will be showing up at the party and you want to establish plausible deniability. Now replace “pedophile” with “hilariously misspelled, overtly racist, or just plain pig-ignorant sign” and the respect Geller has for her fellow attendees becomes all too apparent.</span></a></div>
