		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef012875d5e80c970c-content"><p>Hi Mr. SEK. Happy Thanksgiving! I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a Truth that the Sarah one is using her book tour &quot;as a prelude to a 2012 presidential bid launch&quot; and all. Nobody in her situation would explicitly close that door until after the book tour. There&#39;s just certain ways you do this sort of book tour thing I think. But there&#39;s no reason to think she&#39;s gonna run for president. I think running for president would show a startling lack of imagination on her part, actually, and plus also it&#39;s simply not a good idea.</p>

<p>Also I really don&#39;t think Darleen is all about the creating and the maintaining of the structural blah blah blah. I think mostly she just likes the Sarah Palin and thinks the Sarah hasn&#39;t gotten a fair shake. There&#39;s a lot of truth to that, really, but I don&#39;t really expect better in this little country anymore. It&#39;s a good thing though that there are Darleens what do. It&#39;s hopeful.</p></span>

You probably have to sort of zoom around with your camera to make sure you get minority ones in the shot at a Hannah Montana concert too, and Hannah Montana isn&#39;t particularly political really. Hannah M. invited the little president man&#39;s kids to be on her show, and they&#39;ve been to her concert several times I think and had a good time even if it wasn&#39;t really a very down with the struggle thing to do.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s better not to racialize these sort of celebrity run-in situations unless you have some really compelling point to make.</p></span>

John Kerry got the same treatment, remember - he was painted as a rather french sort of homo person. A ponce what was out of step with Real America. Honestly you can read way too much into this sort of thing I think. Sometimes it seems like liberals are just offended by the dynamics of a campaign where there&#39;s inescapably two sides to an issue. It really seems to unnerve them kind of.

<p>Notice how some bishop told the Kennedy representative to toe the catholic line on abortion or be cut off from the symbols of catholicism.</p>

<p>Got a feeling a lot of non Catholic churches are soon going to find themselves taxable.  The cost of medical care will continue to go up with the 600 plus catholic hospitals operating totally tax free.</p>

<p>You all are wasting your time even dreaming that anyone but a catholic will be a president.  Hell, they&#39;ll probably drag poor old Clarance Thomas out to be vice president since he is a catholic.</p></span>

I know about manga and its many varieties, but I lack the sort of fluency with its conventions that I have with American mainstream and independent books. My question to you is this: What should I read to acquire a robust, intuitive working vocabulary with manga?</span></a></div>
