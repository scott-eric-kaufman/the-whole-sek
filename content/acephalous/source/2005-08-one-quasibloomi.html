        <meta name="description" content="As I'm prepping my contribution to The Valve's mini-seminar on Philip Roth's The Plot Against America, I've slammed into something I have to account but don't believe I'm doing so adequately. To quote my future-self: In American Pastoral, the central character, Swede Levov, searches for answers about (and the current address of) his daughter-the-political-terrorist, Merry. One account of her radicalization blames it on her relationship with her grandfather, Lou Levov, who &quot;during the Vietnam War ... had begun mailing Merry copies of the letters he sent to President Johnson, letters that he had written to influence Merry's behavior more than the president's&quot; (287-88). While visiting during &quot;the summer of the Watergate hearings,&quot; Lou and Merry spend the majority of the time haranguing the television: &quot;The so-called patriots,&quot; Lou Levov said to [Swede's wife] Dawn,&quot; would take this country and make Nazi Germany out of it. You know the book It Can't Happen Here? There's a wonderful book, I forget the author, but the idea couldn't be more up-to-the-moment. These people have taken us to the edge of something terrible.&quot; (287) The first question raised by this passage is why Roth deliberately elides or Lou unthinkingly forgets Sinclair Lewis' name. I have no answer to that question outside of a very general statement about authorial anxiety. In The Plot Against America, Roth shies away from associating Lewis' name with his novel. Despite the incredible popularity of It Can't Happen Here--published in '36 to capitalize on the upcoming election, adapted for the theater that same year and performed by WPA actors across the country, It Can't Happen Here may've been the most popular, i.e. most-read and most-watched, work of 1936--Roth fails to mention it even though it belonged to the world the novel shares with ours. (The Lindbergh Administration takes office in 1940.) While I can see the practical reason for failing to mention it--an actual prophetic novel which imagines much of the same ground as an imaginative alternative history probably has no place in it--there's something off-putting about the fact that Roth still feels compelled to have Lewis appear, albeit briefly, in The Plot Against America: Meanwhile, Walter Winchell continued to refer to the Bundists as &quot;Bundits,&quot; and Dorothy Thompson, the prominent journalist and wife of novelist Sinclair Lewis, who'd been expelled from the 1939 Bund rally for exercising what she called her &quot;constitutional right to laugh at ridiculous statements in a public hall,&quot; went on denouncing their propaganda in the same spirit she'd demonstrated three years ealier when she'd exited the rally shouting &quot;Bunk, bunk, bunk!

			<p>As I'm prepping my contribution to <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/">The Valve</a>'s mini-seminar on Philip Roth's <em>The Plot Against America</em>, I've slammed into something I have to account but don't believe I'm doing so adequately.&nbsp; To quote my future-self:</p>

<p>

In <em>American Pastoral</em>, the central character, <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=598,height=944,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/american_pastoral.jpg"><img width="100" height="157" border="0" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/american_pastoral.jpg" title="American_pastoral" alt="American_pastoral" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>Swede Levov, searches for answers about (and the current address of) his daughter-the-political-terrorist, Merry.&nbsp; One account of her radicalization blames it on her relationship with her grandfather, Lou Levov, who &quot;during the Vietnam War ... had begun mailing Merry copies of the letters he sent to President Johnson, letters that he had written to influence Merry's behavior more than the president's&quot; (287-88).&nbsp; While visiting during &quot;the summer of the Watergate hearings,&quot; Lou and Merry spend the majority of the time haranguing the television:

</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The so-called patriots,&quot; Lou Levov said to [Swede's wife] Dawn,&quot; would take this country and make Nazi Germany out of it.&nbsp; You know the book <em>It Can't Happen Here</em>?&nbsp; There's a wonderful book, I forget the author, but the idea couldn't be more up-to-the-moment.&nbsp; These people have taken us to the edge of something terrible.&quot; (287)</p></blockquote><p>

The first question raised by this passage is why Roth deliberately elides or Lou unthinkingly forgets Sinclair Lewis' name.&nbsp; <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=1171,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/plot_against_america.jpg"><img width="100" height="146" border="0" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/plot_against_america.jpg" title="Plot_against_america" alt="Plot_against_america" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>I have no answer to that question outside of a very general statement about authorial anxiety.&nbsp; In <em>The Plot Against America</em>, Roth shies away from associating Lewis' name with his novel.&nbsp; Despite the incredible popularity of <em>It Can't Happen Here</em>--published in '36 to capitalize on the upcoming election, adapted for the theater that same year and performed by WPA actors across the country, <em>It Can't Happen Here</em> may've been the most popular, <em>i.e.</em> most-read and most-watched, work of 1936--Roth fails to mention it <em>even though</em> it belonged to the world the novel shares with ours.&nbsp; (The Lindbergh Administration takes office in 1940.)&nbsp; While I can see the practical reason for failing to mention it--an actual prophetic novel which imagines much of the same ground as an imaginative alternative history probably has no place in it--there's something off-putting about the fact that Roth still feels compelled to have Lewis appear, albeit briefly, in <em>The Plot Against America</em>:

</p><blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Walter Winchell continued to refer to the Bundists as &quot;Bundits,&quot; and Dorothy Thompson, the prominent journalist and <em>wife of novelist Sinclair Lewis</em>, who'd been expelled from the 1939 Bund rally for exercising what she called her &quot;constitutional right to laugh at ridiculous statements in a public hall,&quot; went on denouncing their propaganda in the same spirit she'd demonstrated three years ealier when she'd exited the rally shouting &quot;Bunk, bunk, bunk!&nbsp; <em>Mein Kampf</em>, word for word!&quot; (177, emphasis mine)</p></blockquote><p>

Who is Sinclair Lewis in the fictional world of Roth's novel?&nbsp; <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=290,height=475,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/it_cant_happen_here.gif"><img width="100" height="163" border="0" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/it_cant_happen_here.gif" title="It_cant_happen_here" alt="It_cant_happen_here" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>A novelist with an important wife.&nbsp; Roth seems unable to do with another what he does so masterfully with <del>himself</del> <em>his selves</em>, namely relate to an actual novelist who has written a novel very similar to one he himself has written.&nbsp; Does Roth want us to assume that Lewis' novel <em>hasn't</em> been written in his alternative history, and that the American people suffer for it?&nbsp; Are readers to assume that the absence of Lewis' novel from Roth's fictional America has that deleterious an effect, and conversely, that the potential significance of such propagandistic novels shouldn't be dismissed?&nbsp; Can this account for Roth's naïve realism?&nbsp; Would that not transform <em>The Plot Against America</em> into the <em>roman à clef</em> whose dangers were outlined in <em>American Pastoral</em>?</p>

<p>Any of you have any idea how you'd answer those questions?&nbsp; And do you think they're important or am I detail-hounding like a guy who never wants to finish his dissertation?&nbsp; As you can probably imagine, all this results from an earlier discussion on the multiple Roths who populate his novels.&nbsp; I think I may be arguing myself into a deeply stupid corner.&nbsp; To wit: &quot;Roth relates to sophisticated imbrications of his multiple fictional selves better than he handles the inclusion of actual authors whose work foot-prints pepper every page of <em>The Plot Against America</em>.&quot;&nbsp; So take a shot at it and if you come up with something smart by Monday morning, I'll delete the comment, steal the credit and kick your puppy.&nbsp; </p>&nbsp;

		<span id="comment-8908731-content"><p>Greil Marcus delivered a very interesting lecture on Lewis and Roth at Penn this past spring.  He assumed that Roth&#39;s use of the Lewis as intertext would be obvious to readers -- Marcus didn&#39;t even cite, to my memory, these passages directly referencing Lewis in *The Plot*.  And, in a classic Marcus move, he ditched both Lewis and Roth to discuss the riot-grrl movement as a real, hands-on approach to the loss of rights in America.  </p>

<p>Marcus&#39;s most important query was this: why would Roth write an anti-Nazi novel in the 21st century?  Either (a) the book&#39;s attempts at political thinking are irrelevant; or (b) Roth is making a facile connection between a fascist America and the Bush regime.  For Marcus, both are irresponsible positions.  Thus the turn to the riot grrls.</p>

<p>Marcus, of course, totally ignores how historical novels -- or counterfactual novels -- work (just as Walter Benn Michaels makes the utterly ignorant remark in *The Shape of the Signifier* that Toni Morrison&#39;s *Beloved* is simply a late anti-slavery novel).  The point of historical fiction, in nearly every instance I can think of, is to examine a certain historical moment when history could have gone in different directions.  Some historical novelists go on to show the inevitability of the present; others seek to recover a trace from the past for future use.  Most -- like the master, Walter Scott -- are torn between the two.  </p>

<p>That said, I haven&#39;t read *The Plot*, so I can&#39;t discuss further to what extent Roth follows or extends or challenges the historical novel tradition.  But that&#39;s where I&#39;d want to position these questions.  As Linda Hutcheon has argues, historical novels today (and, as I&#39;d argue, most historical novels) deal with history by revising the literature of the past.  That Roth draws on Lewis is no surprise then.  I&#39;d say that his need to at least mention Lewis is to squash critics who might wonder if Roth is familiar with Lewis&#39;s novel.  And that his lack of direct, in-depth attention to Lewis&#39;s novel within his own is (a) an attempt to distinguish himself from the key meta historical novel with real novelists in it, *Ragtime*, and (b) a desire to claim some originality beyond simply &quot;remaking&quot; Lewis&#39;s novel for a new century.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-8910993-content"><p>I dislike Roth&#39;s writing, and I can easily imagine that Roth elided Lewis&#39; name out of simple vanity.  After all, Roth&#39;s recognition that he was re-writing an old standard might not be the best way to reinforce his self-image as great author.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re talking alternate history and Nazis, there are two books that are de rigeur.  The first is one I&#39;ve recommended so often that I hardly need to type the words again: Philip K. Dick&#39;s _The Man In The High Castle_.  The second is a bit more interesting for the present case: Norman Spinrad&#39;s _The Iron Dream_.  Every SF fanboy should be strapped down Clockwork Orange-style and forced to read _The Iron Dream_; the book is an extended shout about what should be obvious about its own genre.  It might be interesting to read Roth, who I&#39;d guess strenuously avoids any notion that his alternate history might be part of a creakingly old SF genre theme, in this light.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-8917845-content"><p>Rich, I had that thought at first as well, but Roth&#39;s not <i>that kind</i> of petty asshole.  <i>The Ghost Writer</i>, for example, is littered with references with and homages to other Balzac, Zola, Kafka, &amp;c.  I haven&#39;t read the Spinrad, but on your recommendation it&#39;s shot to the top of my list.</p>

<p>LB, first I&#39;ve had a draft of a response to your email in my draft folder for about a week now, and will finish it as soon as I can access my draft folder again.  As for what you&#39;ve said here, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s too worried about the <i>Ragtime</i> comparisons, since the tone of <i>TPAA</i>&#39;s so different I didn&#39;t even draw that connection.  I think the tone&#39;s of the novel&#39;s important, because on the one hand it differentiates it from the tone of <i>It Can&#39;t Happen Here</i>, which while a realist novel, seems to possess the rushed quality of its composition, and lacks the weight of history of <i>TPAA</i>...which, now that I think about, makes its presence known in an important respect:</p>

<p>Even though the narrative voice is focalized through the young &quot;Philip Roth,&quot; it speak with a somber, knowing tone that belies the narratological conceit; <i>i.e.</i> while the narrator never lets on that he knows more than young Roth, he clearly seems to possess knowledge of events (the Holocaust) the young Roth couldn&#39;t have known about.  (And while this may be something we bring to the text, I think it might also be something evoked by the text, and thus is different from <i>It Can&#39;t Happen Here</i>, the cartoonish qualities of which make it difficult even for more readers to see portents of the Holocaust.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-8918317-content"><p>Very little of the very little Roth I&#39;ve read has impressed me deeply. (And no, I&#39;m not inclined to blame Roth for that. Hell, he managed to be friends with Philip Guston, so the guy&#39;s gotta be OK. Better than Greil Marcus, anyway.) (And <i>The Ghost Writer</i> was one of the exceptions.)</p>

<p>Parentheses closed, my guess is that 1) Roth has read Sinclair Lewis, and 2) you&#39;re talking about two different novels.</p>

<p>In the first, Levov&#39;s forgetfulness characterizes a politicized reader, one who notices nothing but the sought-after message they pluck from the (to them) transparent (and unmemorable) medium. I&#39;ve met plenty of these people. They&#39;re not interested in the author, because they&#39;re not interested in anything but the slogan. </p>

<p>In the second, yes, it would be very awkward to mention <i>It Can&#39;t Happen Here</i> in this context. So if Roth is as skilled an alternate-history writer as Howard Waldrop or Tim Powers or Kim Newman (or even as skilled as Philip K. Dick), he would, yes, mention Lewis by name to show that Lewis was there but didn&#39;t write (or didn&#39;t successfully publish) that book.</p>

<p>Why not try to contact Roth and ask him? The worst he can do is ignore us, and I bet he&#39;s doing that right now, the bastard.<br />

		<span id="comment-8919635-content"><p>Well, I haven&#39;t actually read the Roth book, so I&#39;ll give up on speculating about it.</p>

<p>About _The Iron Dream_, it&#39;s a book where you get the idea within the first few pages, and I&#39;d guess that most everyone who reads it is tempted to stop part way through.  But its sadistic, sustained, authorial attack on the reader is part of its intended effect.  It&#39;s like reading all of 1930s - 1950s SF in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>I will quote the beginning and end of its &quot;About the Author&quot; page, which tells exactly what kind of alternate history it is:</p>

<p>&quot;About the Author</p>

<p>Adolf Hitler was born in Austria on April 20, 1889.  As a young man he migrated to Germany and served in the German Army during the Great War.  After the war, he dabbled briefly in radical politics in Munich before finally emigrating to New York in 1919.&quot;</p>

<p>[About the Author then goes on with brief highlights: sidewalk artist in Greenwich Village, illustrator for _Amazing_ in 1930, debut as an SF writer in 1935, published the fan magazine _Storm_ for nearly ten years, won posthumous Hugo 1955.]</p>

<p>&quot;For many years, he had been a popular figure at SF conventions, widely known in science-fiction fandom as a wit and nonstop raconteur.  Even since the book&#39;s publication, the colorful costumes he created in _Lord of the Swastika_ have been favorite themes at convention masquerades.  Hitler died in 1953, but the stories and novels he left behind remain as a legacy to all science-fiction enthusiasts.&quot;</p>

<p>If you do decide to skip most of the book, do check out the &quot;Afterword to the Second Edition&quot; at the end, which is written as the kind of criticism of SF by an academic that was fashionable at one time.</p>

<p>Will this by useful in criticizing Roth?  I&#39;m not sure; it depends on how concious Roth appears to be of the triteness of his use of alternate history in this context and of how much he realizes the triviality of telling his alternate history through the life of one imaginary adolescent.  There is something about the sweep of Spinrad&#39;s work -- harshly settling down to deliberately write a bad 300+ page novel that indicts his entire genre -- that, I think, might tend to be an instructive contrast to Roth&#39;s.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-8975790-content"><p>Hi Scott-- This is an interesting conversation. I haven&#39;t read the Plot, but I&#39;ve read American Pastoral and the Human Stain. I read Roth for pleasure and despite how engaging I find his novels for his writing style, I am also frustrated by something cold and calculating in his work. It&#39;s a bit of a turn-off, but <i>de gustibus non est disputandum</i>... to each his own. Here&#39;s an example of why Roth pissed me off. In American Pastoral, there&#39;s that moment when the protagonist is hit with a barrage of obscenity from his alienated daughter and literally vomits on her. That&#39;s rage-porn my friend, rage-porn! Your take on Lewis in Roth and Luther&#39;s response are very interesting. Enough to make me pick up the paperback of The Plot to check it out. As long as there is no gratuitous rage-porn in it!</p></span>
