<p>(Husband staggers in, looking depressed and hung over.)<br />
Wife: What&#39;s wrong?  You look like this all the time now.<br />
Husband: Dunno.<br />
Wife: Well I do!  I&#39;ve been following you, and I think that you&#39;re going to a club, getting drunk, having sex with all kinds of people and then feeling guilty about it.  Tell me, is that it?<br />
Husband:  Well, do you remember reading Scott Eric Kaufman&#39;s blog about how he hid his cancer from his wife to try to spare her?<br />
Wife:  Oh, I&#39;m so sorry I didn&#39;t trust you.  You must have been dealing with so much all this time.  Is it cancer?<br />
Husband:  No, I&#39;ve actually been getting drunk and sleeping with people.  But it could have been cancer!  Now think -- at least it&#39;s not cancer.  Would you really have wanted me to go through that?<br />
Wife: I guess not.  But I&#39;m so pissed off now that maybe I would.<br />
Husband: See why I was cheating on you?  You want me to get cancer!</p></span>

<p>I&#39;m underplaying the depths of my depression here.  I was really in a terrible place, of the sort that some people don&#39;t come back from, and thought I was doing my wife a favor by not telling her ... which should be indication enough of the state of mind I was in.

(And considering what happens to me, imagine where I&#39;d be if I didn&#39;t.)  I only hope no one judges me on the basis of how I behaved when my thyroid rebelled and flooded my system with hormones ... because I behaved poorly.  Irrationally.  Did things I wouldn&#39;t otherwise have done.  Thought things I wouldn&#39;t otherwise have thought.  I&#39;m not abdicating responsibility for what I did and thought while in the throws, but a little understanding would be appreciated.</p>

<p>That said, I did receive a bit of the beating I so richly deserved.  Fortunately, my wife punches like a girl.  (<em>ducks</em>)  (<em>unducks, is decked</em>)</p></span>

I think that it is to some extent a question of tone.  You&#39;re a consumate storyteller, and so sometimes hold off or, as you note, underplay some key aspects of the story that would make it less dramatic, but also more understandable/sympathizable.  This is the second time I think I&#39;ve run into you telling this story, and both times it came out as a part of a larger discussion of cancer and/or woes, and so people understanbly respond, &quot;Oh that&#39;s awful! -- Wait, what?&quot;<br />
Having known many people who suffered with depression, including having lost my brother to it, I think I understand more than most the decisions that such folks make that seem perfectly rational and even considerate to them at the time, but are in fact pretty thoroughly crazy.<br />
Hope your check-up went well.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-93569114-content"><p>Jodi, thanks for that.  More and more often, I think things have to normalize -- law of averages and all -- but then the library steals all my money, or I find pictures of a friend&#39;s husband having sex with hundreds of women, and then I remember: no, apparently this is the life I was born to lead.  The humor&#39;s Jewish to the core, in that it has more than a hint of resignation.</p>

<p>Fritz, I&#39;m not sure &quot;awesome&quot; is the word other people would use to describe it.  They prefer more violent terms.</p>

<p>JPool, this is something I certainly need to be more attentive to:</p>

<p><em>You&#39;re a consummate storyteller, and so sometimes hold off or, as you note, underplay some key aspects of the story that would make it less dramatic, but also more understandable/sympathizable.</em></p>

<p>(More attentive <em>to</em>?  Shouldn&#39;t that be <em>of</em>?  No matter.)  </p>

<p>But the strange thing is, the post pretty much accords with my memory of the events.  This could very well be an artifact of having told the story on numerous occasions -- there&#39;s two ways to hone material: 1) do it conversation, see how it works best, then put it on the blog (this post) or 2) bang it out on the blog, never figure out quite how to tell it, then refer people to the blog (&quot;My Morning&quot;).  Ideally, I&#39;d go with the first option, but that means the constant reiterations will shape the narrative; whereas when I shape it for the blog, the story becomes almost untellable.  (I certainly can&#39;t tell &quot;My Morning&quot; as well in person, if only because I don&#39;t remember my dialogue.)  (Maybe I should learn it?  No, wait, that&#39;s insane.)  (Then again, given how often I&#39;m asked to repeat it ... my life, now a performance.  Great, just great.)</p>

<p>As to this particular event:</p>

<p><em>I think I understand more than most the decisions that such folks make that seem perfectly rational and even considerate to them at the time, but are in fact pretty thoroughly crazy.</em></p>

<p>This was certainly the case with me.  I made what were, to my mind, a series of rational decisions.  I even thought I was being considerate in keeping the information to myself, since my wife and parents are so busy.  Why worry them?  They have enough on their plates.  In retrospect, obviously the wrong decision, but there&#39;s a hint of rationality to it, desperate though it may be.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to hear about your brother.</p></span>

<p>So that&#39;s what the really angry guy was angry about?  The one who was posting porn here to try to get you in trouble?</p>

<p>Wait a minute, my mind boggles.  Do I even want to ask how you found these pictures?  I mean, was this &quot;I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll mind if I look in his desk to borrow a pen&quot; and then oops?  Or was it the Google search for pictures of your friend that turns up, wait a minute, doesn&#39;t that guy look familiar?</p>

<p>And how do you know it was hundreds of women?  I imagine a marathon counting session, memorizing distinctive birthmarks or something so you can tell one relatively nondescript person from another.   I can&#39;t help myself from making another playlet:</p>

<p>Scott: I&#39;m sorry to have to tell you this, but...<br />
Scott&#39;s friend: What is it?<br />
Scott: Your husband has been having sex with hundreds of women.<br />
Scott&#39;s friend: (incredulous)  What?<br />
Scott: Hundreds.<br />
Scott&#39;s friend: How do you know -- wait.  It can&#39;t be hundreds.  Don&#39;t you just mean a lot?<br />
Scott: Accuracy is very important to me!  You know how careful I am with my research.<br />
Scott&#39;s friend: So you counted them?<br />
Scott: All right, there were 205.  Or maybe 204, it was hard to tell whether one shot was of him with twins, or a kind of double exposure thing.<br />
Scott&#39;s friend: 204?<br />
Scott: Or 205.  But I thought it would sound better to say hundreds than 205.  I mean, who would believe 205?<br />
Scott&#39;s friend: 194, now...<br />
Scott: Yeah.<br />
Scott&#39;s friend: 194 wouldn&#39;t sound so bad.<br />
Scott: If I could have said 194, I would have said 194.  But I had to be honest.</p>

<p>No, this is getting too absurd.</p></span>

Granted, four different people in four different offices assured me that everything related to the library had been settled ... but I choose to believe the four people I talked to today, because I am an optimist. I want to thank all the good folk here and elsewhere for the sympathy and sound advice. Contrary to what some people think, not curling fetal and muttering nonsense says nothing about my manliness and everything about my utter resignation to absurdity. When Sisyphus wrote I'd tell you to cheer up, that there's always a light at the end of the tunnel, but I'd worry that in your case it would only mean that there was an oncoming train. I laughed and realized that the perverse optimism that keeps me upright instead of fetal remains intact despite it all. This stubborn resistance to the empirical fact of my karmic debt likely means I'll one day turn Republican. So be it. In the meantime, I'll watch the fourth season of The Wire secure in the knowledge that Michael, Randy, Duquan and Namond will all survive unscathed. (Speaking of Namond ... )</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/the-kindness-of.html"><span><strong>The Kindness of Strangers</strong> Someone who wishes to remain anonymous bought me the first and third seasons of The Wire. I can't thank this person enough. (Now I can review the series ass-to-elbows before the fifth season starts.) However, my anonymous benefactor had him a condition: You've been victimized by a well-intentioned system sagging under its own weight. No wonder you watch The Wire. But your Amazon wish list confuses me. [...] You own the second and fourth seasons but not the first and third? Have you not seen the first and third? You need to. [...] I'm sending you the first and third seasons on one condition: you tell me and the world why you've only watched the second and fourth seasons. Fail to do so and expect a visit from my man Omar. I wish I had a more interesting explanation. I've seen the first and third, but came to own the second and fourth under odd circumstances: My best friend from Baton Rouge came out to visit last month. He'd seen the first season. The second season was playing on HBO On Demand. Then it wasn't. So we trekked to Best Buy and he bought me the second season. The day before he left, the third season appeared On Demand. We watched until the wee hours of the night and then he went home. Two weeks later a package arrived on my stoop. My friend had ordered me a copy of the fourth season to thank me for putting him up. And that is how I came to own the second and fourth seasons of The Wire.</span></a></div>
