			<p>For the moment, I’m going to pretend I’ve never read an entire novel
by John Updike and judge his literary legacy on the basis of one
paragraph <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/bshapiro/2009/01/28/john-updikes-dead-do-we-still-have-to-pretend-to-like-his-books/">singled out</a>
as representative of the awfulness of his prose.&#0160; The passage, we are
told, typifies his habit “vacillat[ing] from the tedious to the
atrocious,” scoring “somewhere between Thomas Hardy and Kate Chopin on
the soporific scale,” and reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Men emerge pale from the little printing plant at four
sharp, ghosts for an instant, blinking, until the outdoor light
overcomes the look of constant indoor light clinging to them. In
winter, Pine Street at this hour is dark, darkness presses down early
from the mountain that hangs above the stagnant city of Brewer; but now
in summer the granite curbs starred with mica and the row houses
differentiated by speckled bastard sidings and the hopeful small
porches with their jigsaw brackets and gray milk-bottle boxes and the
sooty ginkgo trees and the banking curbside cars wince beneath a
brilliance like a frozen explosion.</p></blockquote>
<p>
There’s much Updike wrote I won’t defend—<em>Toward the End of Time</em> deserved the slagging it received—but for <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/author/bshapiro/">Young Master Shapiro</a> to choose, from a hefty body of work, the opening paragraph of <em>Rabbit Redux</em> to bury Updike beneath <em>should</em>
stand as the object lesson in why movement conservatives whose tastes
range from Forsythe to Uris ought not be writing about literature.&#0160; I’m
loath to even defend it, as it needs no defense, but here goes:
</p>
<p>
Sentence #1:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Men emerge pale from the little printing plant at four
sharp, ghosts for an instant, blinking, until the outdoor light
overcomes the look of constant indoor light clinging to them.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Heavy alliteration on the “p” plays to the plodding of the pale people
who emerge from the printing plant.&#0160; The sentence turns on a dime,
dropping the alliteration and transforming the men into “ghosts for an
instant.” That instant lasts the space of the following comma—the
blink—and the blinking strips them of their ghostliness.&#0160; Needless to
say, “ghostliness” describes a thing one <em>is</em>, not a quality one <em>has</em>,
but Updike’s inverting the effect here—the men appear ghostly to each
other as their eyes adjust to the light, but Updike would have us
believe they <em>become</em> ghostly, only to rematerialize as daylight strips the indoor light from their bodies.&#0160; 
</p>
<p>
Sentence #2:
</p>
<blockquote><p>In winter, Pine Street at this hour is dark, darkness
presses down early from the mountain that hangs above the stagnant city
of Brewer; but now in summer the granite curbs starred with mica and
the row houses differentiated by speckled bastard sidings and the
hopeful small porches with their jigsaw brackets and gray milk-bottle
boxes and the sooty ginkgo trees and the banking curbside cars wince
beneath a brilliance like a frozen explosion.</p></blockquote>
<p>
More inversion: Updike opens with the dark wintry mood in a clause that
hangs above everything after the semi-colon the way the mountain “hangs
above the stagnant city of Brewer.” The sentence then shifts into a
higher gear.&#0160; We know Updike can set off dependent clauses with a
comma—he did it with “in winter”—so when he lets “but now in summer”
fly, we feel the acceleration as he speeds through those conjunctive
clauses right into a “frozen explosion.” Not that I want to sound like
a student—“the way the author uses diction”—but look at the way the
author uses diction here: the stolidity of the “granite curbs” is
undermined by mica starring it; the aspirations of the small porches
dashed by a pervasive grayness; &amp;c.&#0160; Only, not &amp;c., if you
follow Shapiro’s logic
</p>
<blockquote><p>I am sorry, but reading books is what I do, and I have read literaly [<em>sic</em>]
thousands of them. That first paragraph of Updike’s on this post is
absolute garbage. It is unbelievably pretentious, it is riddled with
ridiculous adjectives, and it is as though he is a bad poet trying to
sound avant garde and choosing words indiscriminately out of a
Thesaurus.</p></blockquote>
<p>
The misspelling, comma-splicing, German-nouning man could not be anymore wrong.&#0160; There may be <em>one</em> too many words up there, but I doubt they came from a thesaurus.&#0160; (Because believe you me, I know <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/all_scribes_uti.html">from thesaurus</a>.) </p><p>(<em><a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/must_we_still_pretend_to_like_john_updike/">x-posted</a></em>.)</p>

Neither party has a monopoly on stupidty.  That said, I can&#39;t pass up the opportunity to slag the &quot;SHAKESPEARE RULEZ!&quot; crowd for failing to recognize the literariness of Updike&#39;s voice.  (I&#39;m not really a fan of Updike, but I&#39;ll admit that his un-reflective misogynistic sentences slumped onto the page in what no one who values literature would call anything less than their Sunday best.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-146818394-content"><p>Also, it&#39;s not a stretch to call the past eight years an aberration in jurisprudence.  Yes, there were extraordinarily extreme circumstances; but that doesn&#39;t mean that we should chuck baby, bath-water, bassinet, other kids and wife overboard.  The Kos Kids might be overreacting, but they&#39;re overreacting to an extraordinary judicial overreach.  For all our sakes, I hope that the courts re-embrace due process; for all our sakes, I hope that <em>habeas corpus</em> is un-suspended (if only so former Gitmo prosecutors don&#39;t have to go on television and slander our reputation in the world community by revealing how amateurish our translations of Arabic were, or how outlandish our evidence against Gitmo detainees is).</p>

<p>I mean, that whole crisis-coming-to-a-head with Russia over an eighth of our bloated, non-functional missile defense shield being in Poland?  The fact that Obama listened to military brass (instead of techno-optimists) and decided that an actual conflict with Russia over a potentially non-functioning defense shield was the best of all options is evidence enough for me that, cynicism aside, we&#39;re about to experience some change-for-the-better.  Because if you ask me, I&#39;d rather my students look at my funny when I tell them about a third grader&#39;s feelings about nuclear war drills . . . </p></span>

		<span id="comment-146833458-content"><p>My grandfather, RIP, had a cousin who spent WWII in a POW camp in Tennessee.  I&#39;ll have to find out whether he had the right to challenge his detention in civilian courts.  Of course, he (the cousin) was a lawful combatant.  I think that a lot of the Kossack&#39;s confusion comes from the fact that they really don&#39;t know too much about the law and lack the ability, or desire, to distinguish between civilian and military contexts.  Either they&#39;re exaggerating the actions of the Bush Administration or their obscenely downplaying the horrors of even your garden variety police state.</p>

<p>You might want to read Ex Parte Milligan, Korematsu v. U.S., and Ex Parte Quirin.  Sure, habeas corpus has been suspended, quite rightly too.</p></span>

Doing some quick searches in response to our co-blogger’s co-blogger’s post about the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, I came across the following chart detailing the ratio of reported cases to deaths in San Fransisco. Not only is it a priceless statistical representation of panic, it also captures the malleability of even professional opinion. To wit: I’ve highlighted the number of cases in red because blood is the color of riot—and for legibility. With certainty, we can say the author of this study, W.H. Kellogg, captured something of cultural significance when he rocketed his data up and off the y-axis. But the convergence of the incidence and death rates between the 23rd and 30th of November may be even more interesting. How do we account for the fact that, for one short week, everyone who caught the disease died from it? Easy: According to the 21 November article, because public health officials claimed that “the influenza epidemic had been stamped out,” at noon “[t]he shrieking of every siren in San Fransisco, blowing of whistles, clanging of gongs and the ringing of bells will . . . signal for throwing away the gauze face coverings” (9). Why were there no more new cases reported than there were deaths the next week? Because someone said there wouldn’t be. So there weren’t. People caught colds and had the sniffles, but it wasn’t Spanish flu. Couldn’t be. The epidemic was over. Did you somehow sleep through the infernal cacophany last Tuesday? The city has no more need for mass-prophylaxis. Everyone who catches the bug now brought it with them on the boat, and everyone knows you can’t catch flu from boat-people. Wait—what do you mean, “How do I think it got here in the first place?” What? How come nobody told us—quick! Everyone! En masque en masse! So said the San Fransisco Chronicle on 4 December, and back up the panic-axis we go . . .</span></a></div>
