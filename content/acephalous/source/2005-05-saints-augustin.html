media has been compromised in some unprecedented ways.</p></blockquote><p>...when I could've been reading <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/15984">this</a>:</p><blockquote><p>We have come in this country to tolerate many such
fixed opinions, or national pieties, each with its own baffles of
invective and counterinvective, of euphemism and downright
misstatement, its own screen that slides into place whenever actual
discussion threatens to surface. We have for example allowed American
biological research to fall behind that in countries where stem cell
programs are not confused with &quot;cloning&quot; and &quot;abortion on demand,&quot;
countries in other words where rationality is not held hostage to the
posturing of the political process. We have allowed all rhetorical
stops to be pulled out on non-issues, for example when the federal
appeals court's Ninth Circuit ruled the words &quot;under God&quot; an
unconstitutional addition to the Pledge of Allegiance. The Pledge was
written in 1892 by a cousin of Edward Bellamy's, Francis Bellamy, a
socialist Baptist minister who the year before had been pressured to
give up his church because of the socialist thrust of his sermons. The
clause &quot;under God&quot; was added in 1954 to distinguish the United States
from the atheistic Soviet Union.
</p>

<p>&quot;Ridiculous&quot; was the word from the White House about the ruling
declaring the clause unconstitutional. &quot;Junk justice,&quot; Governor Pataki
said. &quot;Just nuts,&quot; Senator Daschle said. &quot;Doesn't make good sense to
me,&quot; Representative Gephardt said. There was on this point a genuinely
bipartisan rush to act out the extent of the judicial insult, the
affront to all Americans, the outrage to the memory of the heroes of
September 11. After the June 2002 ruling, members of the House met on
the Capitol steps to recite the Pledge—needless to say the &quot;under
God&quot; version—while the Senate interrupted debate on a defense
bill to pass, unanimously, a resolution condemning the Ninth Circuit
decision. </p>
<p>These were, some of them, the same elected representatives who had
been quick to locate certain upside aspects to September 11. The events
could offer, it was almost immediately perceived, an entirely new frame
in which to present school prayer and the constitutional amendment to
ban flag burning. To the latter point, an Iowa congressman running
unsuccessfully for the Senate, Greg Ganske, marked Flag Day by posting
a reminder on his Web site that his opponent, Senator Tom Harkin, who
had spent five years during the Vietnam War as a Navy pilot, had in
1995 opposed the flag-burning amendment. &quot;After the tragic events of
September 11,&quot; the posting read, &quot;America has a renewed sense of
patriotism and a renewed appreciation for our American flag.
Unfortunately, not everyone agrees.&quot; To the school prayer point,
according to <em>The New York Times</em>, a number of politicians were
maximizing the moment by challenging restrictions on school prayer
established by courts over the past four decades. &quot;Post–September
11,&quot; the <em>Times</em> was told by Richard D. Land, president of the
Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist
Convention, &quot;the secularists are going to have a harder time making
their case.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>My Latin&#39;s sufferin&#39; from the seven-year rust.  That I even recognized it as Latin is a miracle of modern science.</p>

<p>Miriam,</p>

<p>Funny Catullus story: Latin 5000--the fifth semester, I think it&#39;d be Latin 500 in the UC-system--in which we did nothing but translate <i>The Aeneid</i> book by book.  Excellent class.  Really got to know the ins-and-outs of Virgil&#39;s style and diction.  Really didn&#39;t think I had to study for the final.  Really didn&#39;t.  Teacher really handed out three dirty and damn near untranslatable epigrams by Catullus.  Book VII of <i>The Aeneid</i> I could&#39;ve translated in my sleep.  But not only could I barely parse Catullus&#39; dense syntax, when I could, I was sure I&#39;d done it incorrectly.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong with me?  Why am I putting <i>these</i> words in some nice Roman&#39;s mouth?  Surely &#39;he will reach his end, but with a dick in his mouth&#39; is a product of my perverted mind.  Prof. D. would be fired for sexual harassment if he forced Suzy Hornisflopper to think, much less write, &#39;not many men do not use him for anal sex.&#39;  And <i>what</i>?  &#39;Beneath his armpits dwells a ferocious goat&#39;?  Do I even know Latin?&quot; Etc. etc. etc. </p></span>

Individual responsibility can be historically compartmentalized, whereas collective trauma/guilt necessarily extends to all members of the collective, past, present and future. In political terms, collective trauma/guilt subtends claims for slavery reparations; furthermore, it focuses attention on the sins of the past instead of the inequities of the present (and therefore botches the opportunity to hold contemporary individuals responsible for the actions that've created/perpetuated these inequities). I'm with Michaels there. I can see why the representation of this continuity in literature would also--if we grant culture this sort of formative power--have implications for politics at large, i.e. dispense with the idea of collective guilt on television and in books and movies and people might think differently. But even though I grant culture the ability to shape thought thusly, I'm not sure that sense of collective trauma and collective guilt could be eliminated. Logically, and ideally, it should be; but I'm not sure it's possible. Without saying that the capacity for this collectivist sense is hard-wired, I'd say I strongly believe that it's a necessary by-product of how humans have and will continue to interact. I realize I've backed myself into a corner, because I not only can't explain why I strongly believe that, I'm also well aware that I might only believe it because of the limitations imposed on my horizons by the cultural moment in which they've been shaped. And, of course, short of undertaking a Gadamerian intellectual history of the past 3,957 years, I can't responsibly refute that latter claim. In short, I currently think that that is necessarily true, but I can't substantiate that claim. A couple hours later, I've devised a satisfactory way to talk about hard-wired models of historical continuity. I'm going to avoid the claims of evolutionary psychology; that is, I'm not going to try to explain why the collectivist model is a universal human default. Instead, I'm going to demonstrate, quickly, how language is built from the bottom-up and use that bolster the idea of an innate collectivism. So... ...Benjamin Whorf came up with the whole notion of cryptotypes, by which he meant pretty much the same thing Chomsky does by deep structure; namely, a level of linguistic categorization that is not directly visible/audible but explains why a language behaves in a particular way. One commonality of all languages is the dual inclusive/exclusive and plural inclusive/exclusive syntax distinctions. They look like this: 1st person dual inclusive - &quot;you and I&quot; 1st person dual exclusive - &quot;he/she and I&quot; 1st person plural inclusive - &quot;we two/three/four/etc. and you&quot; 1st person plural exclusive...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/reason_981_in_f.html"><span><strong>Reason #981 in Favor of a Class Weblog</strong> While tooling around the Internets this morning, I decided to pay attention to the columns sandwiching most of the content I consume. On Holbo's site, I noticed he had linked to his class blog and--because I've often thought of starting one myself--I popped on over and found a post with 104 responses, more than half of them substantial. Now, I know what you're thinking: &quot;But A. Cephalous, you don't even know how many students are in John's class! What if he has 71,981 and only 104 could be bothered to post?&quot; I'm fairly certain John doesn't teach in The Metrodome, but even if he did, 104 students engaged enough to post something substantial is impressive. &quot;But A. Cephalous, John teaches a philosophy class, and you know how philosophers-in-training are with their blather blather blather.&quot; True, but I'm sure my students could blather with the best of them, esp. if properly motivated (i.e. threatened with bodily or gradily harm). I think commenting on a blog is even less informal than posting on a listserv, so next quarter may be the quarter I compel my students to stop their livejournal- and myspace-inspired navel-gazing and enter the era of The PedaBlog! (I know, I know. I'm working on a better, less-likely-to-get-me-incarcerated but still damn catchy appellation.)</span></a></div>
