		<span id="comment-103720582-content"><p>Probably just someone who was trying to mock-insult you and had it come out real-insulting.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s something there, although it isn&#39;t self-importance.  The blog isn&#39;t popular because of some long-ago (in blog time) story about office sex.  Having sex in unusual places is pretty much a typical college experience, right?  That piece was linked to because it was written to forefront your persona; your narrated reactions made it work.  And that&#39;s the consistent thread through your writing: not self-importance but the presence of the writer within the writing.</p>

		<span id="comment-103723500-content"><p>Any sign or independence will be regarded as arrogance by those who don&#39;t dare risk it. Americans resent strong-minded people who don&#39;t have money. They admire strong-minded people with money, e.g. Donald Trump, because sometimes they give some of it away.</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re doomed. Don&#39;t bother trying to clean up your act, they already know who you are. Maybe you should get that cop job you mentioned so you can take bribes and brutalize people. Much more fun than having sex with hot coeds who need an A in your course. That becomes so tedious. Eventually you start promising A&#39;s to the chicks who don&#39;t want to have sex with you.  </p></span>

We have a mail box-- outside the bat-cave, I&#39;ll grant, but a mail box that gets the job done... Academia and marriage, when brought together by the powers of nature and whatnot, lead to academic marriages. As an academic who hopes (probably in vain) to ride the professional coat-tails of an well-cited (if headless) husband, I find it amusing that anyone we know would be that petty. Wintery A, Tomemos and Joe(memos of the massive Kugel) are kings of grammar, rhetoric and wit, in my book. The prickly &quot;Anonimo/a della Facolta di Lettere, Filosofia e Cose-che-non-valgono-la-pena-di-leggere-un-cazzo,&quot; who shows his/her impatience at the package-reception of his/her colleagues, needs to take a deep breath ... and see how long he/she can hold it. (Consider this an Irvinian dare.)</p>

<p>This said, um, WTF?!? Isn&#39;t there enough room of one&#39;s own in the dept. kitchen/mail room for said Sir (or Mme.) Prickly to work through the &quot;mail-envy&quot; without taking it out on unclaimed (if named) packages? </p></span>

<p>Don&#39;t let the haters get you down, man.</p>

<p>Speaking from personal experience, attempts to deny perceptions of arrogance/self-importantance through appeals to reason are doomed to failure.  Aside from the fact that one can of course be supremely self-loving and self-loathing at the same time (cf. Mailer, Norman; Allen, Woody), the haters beileve they have devined some truer aspect of your nature and attempts to claim &quot;But I don&#39;t really believe that.&quot; ring hollow.  All you can control is how you behave towards people, not how they interpret that behavior.</p>

<p>Given the rapid turnover in cohorts, chances are you don&#39;t even know this person.  When you stop going to campus regularly, people still in coursework become a vague and strangley disturbing blur.</p></span>

According to one source, Clinton is willing to concede that the states whose delegates are bound to Obama should be counted. &quot;The way I see it,&quot; confessed one senior Clinton campaign adviser, &quot;it would be political suicide for her to deny Obama's delegates their rightful seats at the convention. She'll let them sit.&quot; However, other sources within the Clinton camp acknowledge that in addition to trying to seat Michigan and Florida delegates, senior staffers have launched a brazen and fundamental challenge to the legitimacy of Obama's delegates. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, one staffer admitted, &quot;We all want all the delegates to count, but only in the right and proper proportion. Hillary's a phenomenal candidate and white. Obama's also compelling. We simply want to make sure the numbers match the voters' true and earnest opinions.&quot; To this end, senior Clinton advisers demanded that, in addition to seating Michigan and Florida delegates, those delegates who pledged their support to Obama have all three-fifths of their vote counted. &quot;We are and remain committed to counting three-fifths of all of Obama's pledged and super-delegates,&quot; said Clinton at a rally in Ohio. &quot;No vote should be uncounted, no matter how fractional.&quot;</span></a></div>
