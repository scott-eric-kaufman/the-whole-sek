If you'll recall, in that post I argued that Vaughn's shot selection is essentially critical of Millar and Romita, Jr.'s excessive lust for representing broken human bodies. To put it another way: in Millar and Romita's book, the characters aren't people so much as bodies to broken; whereas in Vaughn's film, the characters are sympathetic people with lives to be invested in. This dynamic, it turns out, also exists in scenes that don't involve the quantity of blood that a body can realistically bleed out. Consider the scene in which the titular hero, Dave Lizewski, teases the audience with a typical origin story: In the first panel, the dead mother is a headless body sprawled on the floor. The high angle of framing only allows for the reader to register the shock of her death via Lizewski's body language, as his face is so distant that the only visible emotional marker is his oblong, half-opened mouth. That's not a shot that's liable to build sympathy for a character; in point of fact, the almost omniscient perspective in the panel creates a sense of the narrator's distance from the events being narrated (despite said events being the death of his mother). The second panel transposes the reader from the reality (however coldly rendered) of a mother's death to the decidedly unreal world of superhero origin stories. Again, the distance of the reader from Lizewski places the emphasis on his body; his face is an open howl, but his vengence (such that it is) is communicated through the Liefeldian posturing. (I have a strong memory of Sunspot frequently being in an identical posture during Liefeld's run on New Mutants, but Google's being unforthcoming.) All of which is only to say that, in the book, grief is demonstrated not through facial expressions that might lead readers to sympathize with Lizewski, but with exaggerated postures that render him less of a person than a trope. Compare that to the same scene in the film. It opens with an establishing medium shot of the family at breakfast: Then zooms to the right and into a medium close-up of the dead mother: For narrative reasons the cereal occupies the center of the screen, but it also divides the scene between the mother's head and Lizewski's reaction to it falling to the table. His face is visible; his reaction is measurable. The woman at the table is not a headless anonymous thing called &quot;Mother,&quot; but a woman who once was, but is no longer, a presence in a life.

<p>In short, in one she&#39;s just a body; in the other, a mother.</p>

Michael Straczynski, simply doesn't know his passive from his active voice, because both &quot;A dog was killed last night&quot; and &quot;Last night, a dog was killed&quot; are clearly in the passive. Then I thought Clark Kent's response may have been Straczynski's way of underming Perry's authority, because &quot;Someone killed a dog last night&quot; is clearly in the active voice. Then I realized that &quot;Someone killed a dog last night&quot; was not—as &quot;A dog was killed last night&quot; and &quot;Last night, a dog was killed&quot; were—in quotation marks in the panel itself, meaning it's just a direct statement of concern from the Man Who Would Be Superman. Perry's answer (&quot;Just an example, Kent&quot;) would seem to indicate as much. Then I remembered that Superman: Earth One is a re-telling of Superman's origin in which the would-be Man of Steel is reluctant to take up the mantle, which means his concern for an anonymous dog is only consistent with the character Straczynski's reinventing, not the one he's reinvented, meaning that quotations or no, that's got to be a criticism of Perry. Then I saw that Kent follows Perry's remark with the statement &quot;I like dogs,&quot; which would mean Straczynski's being inconsistent with the character, which would mean that he really doesn't know the difference between the active and passive voices since there's no critique, implicit or otherwise, of Perry's statement ... ... at which point it occurred to me, neither for the first time nor the last, that evaluating student prose has a noxious effect on an academic's ability to function like anything remotely resembling a normal human being.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/11/and-the-worst-moment-of-his-presidency-was.html"><span><strong>And the worst moment of his presidency was...</strong> The former President in a forthcoming interview (emphasis mine): MATT LAUER: You say you told Laura at the time it was the worst moment of your presidency? GEORGE W. BUSH: Yes. My record was strong, I felt, when it came to race relations and giving people a chance. And it was a disgusting moment. You might suppose he's talking about Hurricane Katrina, and if you did, you'd only be half-wrong. Because the &quot;worst moment of [his] presidency,&quot; according to the man himself, was this: According to the man himself, then, Bush placed more importance on whether people perceived him to be racist than what happened to actual black people in the city of New Orleans. In short, he proved Kanye right.</span></a></div>
