<p>That sounds like something out of a Guy Noir routine, which can&#39;t be a good sign for a Woody Allen movie. </p>

<p>Full disclosure: I stopped watching Woody Allen movies after &quot;Hannah and her Sisters&quot;; As much as I enjoyed it, I&#39;ve read about many which followed, none of which seemed worth the time or effort. For that matter, I&#39;ve not watched many that came before, either -- &quot;Sleeper&quot; is about the only one I can name off the top of my head. </p></span>

&quot;You see the whole culture. Nazis, deodorant salesmen, wrestlers, beauty contests, a talk show. Can you imagine the level of a mind that watches wrestling? But the worst are the fundamentalist preachers. Third grade con men telling the poor suckers that watch them that they speak with Jesus, and to please send in money. Money, money, money! If Jesus came back and saw what&#39;s going on in his name, he&#39;d never stop throwing up,&quot;<br />
and often like to extend it to, &quot;milkshakes! they are decadent: what kind of human mind could stoop to drinking such tripe!&quot; (extend joke to infinity)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen 28 of his films. My favorite by a long shot is Sweet and Lowdown: trust me. It&#39;s worth it. Other favorites? Broadway Danny Rose. Zelig. And, for Diane Weist&#39;s role, Bullets over Broadway. Chunks of Everyone Says I Love You are wonderful if you fast forward through most of the Woody Allen story. And What&#39;s Up Tiger Lily (although this is probably best seen for the first time when you&#39;re 16 or 17)</p></span>

<p>This is why I start screaming whenever I see a bit of Good Will Hunting. Over and over I yell &quot;Why are you talking like a Kennedy! Why are you talking like a Kennedy!&quot; Just because the rest of the country thinks that the Kennedy&#39;s have Boston accents and that a kid from Southie would talk like that doesn&#39;t mean someone actually from the area should believe and act like the Kennedy&#39;s don&#39;t have a Brahmin specific accent. BAH. </p>

<p>I think this is also a large part of the reason I actually love Eliza Dushku. Her Boston accent is real, and if it&#39;s not real for her, it&#39;s at least the Boston accent you actually hear in the world</p></span>

(I would&#39;ve been in tenth grade, which sounds about right.)  His career&#39;s really been all downhill for me, it seems; however, its high points number more than just <em>Hannah and Her Sisters</em>.  I love the orneriness of <em>Stardust Memoirs</em>; the pomp of <em>Crimes and Misdemeanors</em>; the sheer inventiveness of <em>The Purple Rose of Cairo</em>.  He&#39;s a towering figure in American cinema, and yet he&#39;s really underrated as a director: the writing and the shtick garner all the attention, the pacing and framing not so much, and on a technical level, even the recent material is brilliant.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t want to watch it anymore.</p></span>

I just found out he directed a movie called &quot;Love and Death&quot; around the time of &quot;Annie Hall&quot; which I have never heard of, let alone seen. That is certainly one for the Netflix queue. I had sort of never realized how early in his career &quot;Annie Hall&quot; was, his sixth movie only -- for some reason I thought the corpus of &quot;early Woody Allen films&quot; was larger than that.</p></span>

<p>My love for the deathless <i>Love and Death</i> surpasses, I believe, even SEK&#39;s. (&#39;I shall walk through the valley of the shadow of death. In fact, now that I come to think of it, I shall <i>run</i> through the valley of the shadow of death, because ... you ... get out of the valley quicker that way.&#39;)</p>

<p>More: I&#39;m nearly finished reading <i>War and Peace</i> (Napoleon is about to enter Moscow; halfway through book eleven) and it&#39;s very very good, but I&#39;m repeatedly reminded that Allen covers pretty much all everything Tolstoy does, plus he has the big laughs.  Seriously: one consequence of my finally getting around to reading <i>War and Peace</i> is thinking what a good light it casts upon Allen&#39;s film.</p></span>

<p>Whatever Works was completely predictable, but I still laughed.  Also, the very end of the film turns all Boris&#39; supposed cynicism on it&#39;s ear, when his brief closing speech to the camera makes clear that &quot;whatever works&quot; is not the mantra of a curmudgeon, but a true humanist.  </p>

<p>Anyway, those of you saying Allen&#39;s in a low period are nuts. In the last five years he&#39;s made three irresistable films; that he also made a couple of movies that were merely entertaining in that period doesn&#39;t change that.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01348509c268970c-content"><p>Just seen Whatever Works this evening. It is contrived, tiresome, boring, lazy &amp; incompetent. I would put up with it if it had been funny in any sense, but it was pompous &amp; very desperate. Larry David usually so good at the &#39;Basil Fawlty&#39; moment wasn&#39;t given a ghost of a chance. The actor who played the English guy could not act AT ALL. A very very two-dimensional effort at characterisation for all the chartacters and pointless story if you could even call it that. When you look at really funny films by Woody Allen such as Sleeper, Bananas, Love &amp; Death, Annie Hall etc this is total rubbish. You can actually hear the camera in several of the scenes, something a good director would try &amp; do something about and an unknown would be called a blatant amateur for if he didn&#39;t. Ever since Bullets over Broadway Woody Allen&#39;s films have to be graded a terrible green &amp; yellow colour, it&#39;s like suffering from a kind of colour-blindness. Just shoot in black &amp; white in future. His films started to go off the rails with Hannah &amp; Her Sisters, since when was Michael Caine funny anyway. WW completes this sad sad deterioration. </p></span>

My lover doesn't cheat on me Because she is so in love with me, I know this. However, maybe she really wants to cheat on me, But fears I would leave her if she did. She should ignore those impulses, though, Because even the thought of her thinking about cheating on me Makes me want to commit suicide. You think you understand this, but you don't; And because you don't, what we have will inevitably die. So we're together for right now, absolutely, But because you're thinking of cheating on me, We shouldn't be. If the cliché about all goods things coming to an end is true, What you and I have is no exception. To pretend otherwise is pure folly. In the meantime, however, We should shake it, shake it, shake it Shake it like a Polaroid picture. So I give the game away in the last two lines, but honestly, did you have any clue that that was the actual content of the happiest song most people will ever hear in their entire life? Now, on an absolutely related note, can you guess how I'm teaching my students about the difference between form and content on Thursday?</span></a></div>

What you got?&quot;</strong> &quot;I think you're gonna love her, sir. Check her out.&quot; &quot;I like what I see there, Ferguson, but she doesn't really seem powerful. She needs—&quot; &quot;A more muscular physique?&quot; &quot;Don't talk crazy, Ferguson. She has to be sexy.&quot; &quot;So you need her to be more powerful, but also still sexy.&quot; &quot;Why don't you give her one of those things?&quot; &quot;You know, one of those things.&quot; &quot;I don't follow.&quot; &quot;Sure you do. One of those things.&quot; &quot;I feel you now. You mean like this?&quot; &quot;Perfect! Still sexy, but now that she has a thing, she's powerful too. Great work, Ferguson!&quot; Because, as we all know, female characters can't be powerful unless they have a thing, as the good folks at Detective Comics took pains to remind us this month: Unlike the other example above, her thing isn't even a psychoanalytic surrogate for a thing and its thingly power. Her thing is shaped like a thing and is used for stabbing. I have nothing more to add but this: please stop publishing comics that make me think of Lacan.</span></a></div>
