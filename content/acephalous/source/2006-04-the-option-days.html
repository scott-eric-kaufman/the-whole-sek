It could have been new prose, it could have been girthy footnotes, it could have been anything.  Once the threshold was reached, the options before me were (a) to continue for a while in the hope of adding another 250k; or (b) to stop there and begin drinking.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-15973040-content"><p>I pace, too - and sound out sentences in my head while I&#39;m doing it.  This is when I&#39;m in an actual concerted writing phase.  I don&#39;t do the &quot;sit in front of a computer for x hours a day&quot; thing - at least, not yet (we&#39;ll see what happens when I get closer to my submission deadline...).  </p>

<p>Instead my writing tends to go in fits and starts.  I start with reading, of course - I need to feel fairly immersed in the materials I&#39;m trying to write about.  This is where I can bog down - getting myself to the point that I feel comfortable enough with the material that I feel I can do justice to it.  I started blogging, among other things, as a means of practicing writing without a high level of immersion in my material...</p>

<p>When I&#39;ve read enough that the strategic point of the piece is in my head but I&#39;m finalising last bits of reading or otherwise preparing to write, then sentences, structures, and concepts tend to percolate through at odd moments, so I&#39;m always snatching stray bits of paper (margins of course materials, backs of envelopes, receipts, whatever comes to hand) and writing ideas out.  I almost never actually use these scraps when I sit down to write - from experience, I know that the best ideas and associations tend to recur - this practice writing is basically just developing associative grooves, so that useful phrases and organisational principles will be close at hand when I need them.</p>

<p>Then I actually tend to spend a couple of days not being able to do anything even remotely related to the writing project.  I&#39;ve learned that I won&#39;t get through this phase any faster by staring at a computer, but that it actually does seem to help to do something that requires sustained... er... nonconceptual concentration - housework, jigsaw puzzles, mindless computer games, reading very &quot;light&quot; material - anything that lets my brain continue working on the structure of the piece in the background, but doesn&#39;t distract me into thinking about some new communicative piece.</p>

<p>And then I settle down for a really intense, sustained burst of writing - broken with bouts of pacing, but otherwise a fairly exclusive activity.  I can complete around 3500 words in a four-hour stretch, can manage a couple of four-hour stretches in a day and, assuming the piece is long enough to require it and that the intensive writing period doesn&#39;t get interrupted by anything else, can keep up writing in this way for around a week - with progressively lessened productivity after the first couple of days - before I can&#39;t &quot;hear&quot; myself any more and have to take a break from writing.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m usually left with a piece that is organisationally and stylistically workable, and with a bucketload of citations to chase up, because references have occurred to me while writing, and I didn&#39;t want to interrupt the writing to chase them down.  So I chase citations (and fix awkward sentences) for a long time after I write...</p></span>

		<span id="comment-15973966-content"><p>N.P. and Adam, I wish I could do the pacing thing, but whenever I do, my mind wanders unproductively.  I do, however, tend to concentrate well while doing menial tasks; I&#39;m Fred F&#39;in Jameson while I do the dishes.  I have numerous techniques to jumpstart my writing, however: I move from Word to Notepad to Outlook to scribbling on a yellow pad or spiral notebook or on a desk or if at a desk then on my knee, &amp;c.  I&#39;m a firm believer that since different media activate different areas of your brain, changing the media (even if only on the computer, <i>i.e.</i> from moving a practiced environment in which Ctrl-I italicizes to one in which html does) makes you rethink, literally re-think, the messsage . . . or brings the fact that you don&#39;t have a message to rethink to the fore.  </p>

<p>I too have sustained bursts of writing, but I find that if I wait for them, patiently, while doing something else, they never come.  They need to be coaxed by the routine to manifest, like a jogger who runs her best after her muscles warm up and her ligaments loosen; eventually she&#39;ll tire, yes, but before doing so she&#39;ll, well, <i>hit her stride</i>.

Part II</strong> Because the sight of the unbroken &quot;Best Introduction To&quot; list inspires vertigo, I've decided to chop it up into smaller disciplinary units and repost an updated version of it. I also want to request that if you think this project worthy, please post a link to this post and a brief explanation of my rationale on your site. (I want to thank John, Richard, Sharon, Lance, Ralph and the New Kid for doing so already.) Or if you're an academic and your departmental listserv isn't too particular about the nature of the emails shot across it, maybe drop your colleagues a line and see if they have any suggestions. Because at this point I've probably exhausted the patience and expertise of my regular 500 readers. I want to reiterate my desire to expand the number and types of categories I have here. For example, I have a numerous medieval categories, but they're almost exclusively English. What's the best book out there on the Provençal troubadours or Andalucían Spain? What about Asia? Or the Indian subcontinent? What about genre? Now for a quick rearticulation of the project: Within every discipline and sub-discipline there is a Book X which most professors recommends to students seeking an intelligent introduction to Subject Y. These are not necessarily books designed to be introductions—The Oxford Companion to Metagrobolism or Introductory Essays on Scandanavian Goregrind and Circumadjacent Genres: A Festschrift in Honor of Bjarni Herjólfsson III—but books recognized by those of requisite expertise as the most comprehensive peek at a particular field. Yes &quot;comprehensive peek&quot; is oxymoronic. That's the point. These books allow any student or autodidact who wishes to acquire functional working knowledge of a field and they come credentialed by scholars in a non-blurby fashion. A beginner who scans book jackets quickly learns that every book &quot;is not merely a genealogy and a critical reassessment of the legacy of everything, but a provocation to our sense of our history and our selves and God and the definitive explanation on why every snowflake is unique and special.&quot; If this beginner thumbs through a scholarly bibliography instead, she may as well be preparing for qualifying exams for all the good that obsessive scholarly comprehensiveness will do her. Too little information and she'll miss the point; too much and she'll be overwhelmed. A solid introductory text of the sort faculty members already assign on a regular basis seems to me a happy medium. So without further ado, I present the new and improved &quot;Best Introduction To&quot; list: __________________________________________ Classics &amp; Church Fathers: Homeric: The Best of the Achaeans, Gregory Nagy Presocratic: Aristotelian: Platonic: Images of Excellence , Christopher Janaway Horatian: Augustinian: Patristic: Medieval England: Anglo-Saxon: Early Medieval: Twelfth Century Renaissance: The Envy of Angels: Cathedral Schools and Social Ideals in Medieval Europe, 950-1200 , C. Stephen Jaeger Medieval: The Cambridge History of Medieval English Literature , David Wallace, ed. Late Medieval: Hochon's Arrow , Paul Strohm Early Modern England: Early Modern: English Renaissance: Renaissance Self-Fashioning : From More...</span></a></div>

Passing over for the moment the importance of the seminar indicated by continuing activity its title implies—&quot;Fear not! You're part of a movement of reframers. You are not now nor will you ever be reframing alone!&quot;—I focus instead on the title of the third session: &quot;From the Framing of Politics to the Politics of Framing.&quot; That's a classic chiasmus . . . even if it lacks the poetry of Yeats' &quot;An Irish Airman Foresees His Death.&quot; Yeats plays with the tension produced by chiasmus in &quot;An Irish Airman.&quot; Observe the final four lines: I balanced all, brought all to mind, The years to come seemed waste of breath, A waste of breath the years behind In balance with this life, this death. Note the imperfection of the outer the chiasmus. The element of &quot;balance&quot; occupies the initial position in both. The idea behind a chiasmus is to create the impression of order. Yeats exploits this by inverting the already inverted terms. The logic of chiasmus demands the second and third lines above read The years to come seemed waste of breath, A waste of breath the years to come . . . Instead Yeats layers the inversions. The airman's past and future—inversive figures from the present moment—occupy the same position in the chiasmus. Both refer to breaths wasted when compared to the heroic death he anticipates. The airman refers to balance while his words undermine the balance of his rhetorical gesture. Yeats strains against the strictures of chiasmus in order to demonstrate the manner in which life does. The failed establishment of poetic order emphasizes the struggle against what Beckett infamously christens &quot;the mess.&quot; The airmen strives &quot;to find a form that accommodates the mess.&quot; Only the mess always wins. The contest to create the order one fails to discern in the world will turn tragic in the end. (On this Beckett insists.) A certain breed of literary scholars failed to learn from this. I admit that my initial infatuation with Deleuzian philosophy stemmed from its opposition to all things hierarchical. Its rhizomes embraced the messiness of the world and I liked that. You know: &quot;To every chiasmus inheres a line-of-flight.&quot; But then there's the other trend in literary scholarship: that of the unacknowledged or crypto-hierarchy which often sails under the flag of Theory. Certainly the perfectly chiasmatic and orderly theoretical works of literature should not condemn the entire enterprise . . . but in panel and session titles like the ones above I see the creep of the worst infecting the best. Fraser's chiasmus is a clever implement designed to channel the conversation in a sorely limited direction. As Brook Thomas explains of another such chiasmus: There is a tendency to...</span></a></div>
