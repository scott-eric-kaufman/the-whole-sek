		<span id="comment-83925421-content"><p>Dude, my field listserv won&#39;t even let you put the CFPs for the upcoming conference on it anymore ---- we had one of those horrible exploding snafus last year where someone posted two too many &quot;here are some useful web sites I made/special conferences I am designing&quot; emails and suddenly we had a barrage of &quot;unsubscribe me&quot; emails going out to the whole lists and then people started forwarding back the unsubscribe requests to the whole list saying, I am not the person to be sending this to, and then other idiot people jumped in helpfully telling them how to unsubscribe, only it was the wrong info, and finally, by the time I was getting 30 or so of these every single day, the list moderator froze the list and sent out an email to staunch the hemorrhaging and now, now you have to email the moderator herself and she and only she will email out your post for you. </p>

<p>So, understandably, it&#39;s pretty quiet over here. Even my grad dept listserv has killjoys writing back caustic emails if you check to see who has a library book checked out. Chilling effect and all that. </p></span>

I used to write a lot about Iain Banks, and while my stuff was piss-poor by literary standards, it was a lot better than most fanboy things.  Did you know that Iain Banks is very commonly assigned to, or chosen for reports by, high school students (or whatever the equivalent is) in Britain?</p>

<p>I did get an Email from Banks himself, though, discussing some of what I&#39;d written, which sort of made up for it.</p>

<p>For academic lists, I always figured that there must be enough old-time professors just getting used to the Internet on there so that every other Email was either A List of 50 Funny Jokes, or I&#39;ve Just Heard About A Dangerous Computer Virus.  So you&#39;re doing better than I imagined.</p></span>

<p>Not sure whether this is a rhetorical question, but to answer it anyway: no, mine certainly isn&#39;t.  I&#39;m constantly amazed by the unprofessional behavior I observe -- both on listservs, and among graduate students generally.  There&#39;s this notion that because we don&#39;t wear suits, passing out drunk at a faculty-hosted party is acceptable behavior.  Boggles the mind, it does.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-84001775-content"><p>There used to be a grad student in my astrophysics department who I&#39;m pretty sure had a problem with alcoholism.  The professors would have these colloquia or something, after which large amounts of wine and other alcoholic beverages would be left over, and then left in the grad student lounge.  Which this person would duly be found sleeping in the next day, after having drunk to capacity.</p>

<p>At whatever ridiculously young age I was then -- in a few years I&#39;ll be more than twice that old, anyway -- I certainly wasn&#39;t confident enough in my adulthood to tell people about this and suggest that they not leave booze around.  That would have been telling on a fellow student.</p>

<p>Maybe the people who pass out drunk at a faculty-hosted party really should be at an AA meeting, instead of being thought of as inappropriately extending their college days.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-84019283-content"><p>It was meant as a kind of rhetorical question: the kind that could either be answered or ignored depending on mood.  Thanks for the answering.  African history is such a small field that this sort of thing seems like professional suicide to me.  I wasn&#39;t sure if the bigger fields, like American History or Literature would afford a certain ammount of anonymity to grad student posters or if this would be conuterbalanced by thematic specialization.</p>

<p>Rich, yeah, certainly some of them do, though some are also just reacting poorly to stress and drinking more than they&#39;d meant to.  My advisor made sure that one of the cautionary tales she told me was of the junior faculty member who drank too much at a departmental party, and whose drunken remarks then got back to the dean and pretty much derailed his career.  That and the classic &quot;When you do get an on campus interview, make sure to drink no more than one glass of wine at the reception.&quot;</p></span>

So why not do for others? I've yet to mention how good Victorianitas is. Examples abound. If you value your sanity, do not read to this blog. It tosses bagged kittens into rivers and feeds upon their kitten screams. (Seriously: it subsists entirely on a diet of kitten screams and puppy tears.) A White Bear also mauls animals. (Only her victims are acceptably ugly, and she uses every part of the carcass, out of respect and a love of blood pudding.) Sisyphus needs to write. She's not alone. Help me by helping her. (But remember who butters your virtual bread.) (That would be me.) Wally ignores Fredric Jameson but writes well regardless: &quot;You don't wonder whether it was true to what you thought you wanted, you measure whether it's written with conviction and (structural) integrity.&quot; File under &quot;sentences now taped to the top of my monitor.&quot; Thanks to Collin, I'm now officially paranoid. War of the Worlds translates into a beautiful funny book. (The entirety of which can be read online.) Catherine should read Oublié sur la Carte's account of the punchline to Rilo Kiley's joke. Now that I think about it, none of those sites need any help from me for traffic, which means this has been an exceptionally bad blog post, brought to you by an exceptionally bad blogger.</span></a></div>

Click over to see the new, cleaner Acephalous. The most significant change is that I've removed the unsightly nightmare of my previous &quot;Best of ...&quot; and replaced it with these: Those will take you directly to &quot;The Best of ...&quot; parts one and two. More tweaking will occur shortly. The second and more substantive issue: I receive many emails (and not infrequent comments, most of which I delete) about swapping links. My link policy is simple: if I read you, I'll add you to the blogroll. If I don't, I won't. However, I don't spend much time peering at my site logs or playing on Technorati, so if you've linked to me and think I'm being haughty by not responding, well, I'm not. I can't read things I don't know exist. If your blogging software doesn't allow you to trackback, send me an email and I'll take a look. Also email if you've written something you think I'll like and/or want to respond to. For that matter, if you regularly write things you think I'll like, leave a comment below and hawk your blog. There's no shame in self-promotion, and I'm always interested in finding new voices.</span></a></div>
