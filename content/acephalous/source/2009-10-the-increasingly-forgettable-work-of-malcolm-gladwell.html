        <meta name="description" content="G.D. pointed out the latest Gladwell article to me, and now that I’ve read it, I’m at a loss for words: rarely in the history of long-form journalism has the pitch been more obvious or the product more strained. Gladwell decided to write an article on violence in the National Football Leauge, went to his editor with his Vick-topical article and was told to run with it. The problem, of course, is that the entire article boils down to this question: Is [football] dogfighting or is it stock-car racing? And that question, I think we can agree, makes little sense for the simple reason that its analogy isn’t analogous. I know that blunt counterintuitive statements are a hallmark of literary journalism, but they need to be founded on something more substantial than this: [I]s the kind of [tau deposit-induced dementia] being uncovered by McKee and Omalu [in former NFL players] incidental to the game of football or inherent in it? Part of what makes dogfighting so repulsive is the understanding that violence and injury cannot be removed from the sport. It’s a feature of the sport that dogs almost always get hurt. Something like stock-car racing, by contrast, is dangerous, but not unavoidably so. The relevant analogy is right there—preventable injuries in Nascar versus the NFL—but had Gladwell went with that, he would have to ditch the dogfighting angle.* The problem, then, is that the once venerable New Yorker would rather be clever and topical than deeply informative. Consider, for example, the career of the go-to literary journalist for me and Ari, John McPhee. His first book was about A Sense of Where You Are, was about the professional basketball player, long-tenured Senator and former Presidential candidate Bill Bradley, but was written before Bradley graduated from Princeton. McPhee did a superlative job outlining what would make Bradley successful, but he didn’t write about him because the New Yorker wanted an article about the Senatorial or Presidential candidate. Similarly, after Katrina the magazine saw fit to print McPhee’s brilliant (and to my students, hilariously unpronounceable) essay “Atchafalaya,” which was first published in in 1987, long before most people outside of Louisiana cared about the state of the levees. My point, as you probably guessed, is that the odds of the New Yorker dipping into their archives and pulling out a Gladwell essay on the strength of its reporting or the depth of its intelligence decrease with every superficially clever, patently topical article they allow him to write and consent to publish. This isn’t to say that Gladwell is incapable of strong reportage or intellectual depth—only that that people can’t seem to convince him to slow down and write something with heft enough to be as relevant twenty years down the line as it is this week. *I have nothing against clever analogies when they actually, you know, work.

to me, and now that I’ve read it, I’m at a loss for words: rarely in
the history of long-form journalism has the pitch been more obvious or
the product more strained. Gladwell decided to write an article on
violence in the National Football Leauge, went to his editor with his
Vick-topical article and was told to run with it. The problem, of
course, is that the entire article boils down to this question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is [football] dogfighting or is it stock-car racing?</p></blockquote>
<p>And that question, I think we can agree, makes little sense for the
simple reason that its analogy isn’t analogous. I know that blunt
counterintuitive statements are a hallmark of literary journalism, but
they need to be founded on something more substantial than this:</p>
<blockquote><p>[I]s the kind of [tau deposit-induced dementia] being
uncovered by McKee and Omalu [in former NFL players] incidental to the
game of football or inherent in it? Part of what makes dogfighting so
repulsive is the understanding that violence and injury cannot be
removed from the sport. It’s a feature of the sport that dogs almost

dangerous, but not unavoidably so.</p></blockquote>
<p>The relevant analogy is right there—preventable injuries in Nascar
versus the NFL—but had Gladwell went with that, he would have to ditch
the dogfighting angle.* The problem, then, is that the once venerable <em>New Yorker</em>
would rather be clever and topical than deeply informative. Consider,
for example, the career of the go-to literary journalist for me and Ari,
John McPhee. His first book was about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374526893/diesekoschmar-20"><em>A Sense of Where You Are</em></a>, was about the professional basketball player, long-tenured Senator and former Presidential candidate Bill Bradley, but <em>was written before Bradley graduated from Princeton</em>. McPhee did a superlative job outlining what would make Bradley successful, but he didn’t write about him because the <em>New Yorker</em> wanted an article about the Senatorial or Presidential candidate.</p>
<p>Similarly, after Katrina the magazine saw fit to print McPhee’s
brilliant (and to my students, hilariously unpronounceable) essay “<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1987/02/23/1987_02_23_039_TNY_CARDS_000347146?currentPage=all">Atchafalaya</a>,” which <em>was first published in in 1987</em>,
long before most people outside of Louisiana cared about the state of

<p>In NASCAR, the goals of the driver include managing risk, avoiding damage, and avoiding accidents. The better the driver, the lower the risk. The entire goal of the team is to get a car across the finish line as fast as possible, and safer cars help. Safety equipment may slow the cars, but in a well-regulated environment, nobody has to cut corners for fear that another team has thrown out their fire extinguishers.</p>

<p>In the NFL, the goal of many members of the team is to seek out collisions. The better the player, the harder he hits, the more damage he causes, the higher his salary. Safety impedes the game.<br />

However, sometimes I think the critics have a point: &quot;What does the white animal follow?&quot; asked Anyanwu's grandson loudly enough for Doro to hear. &quot;What has he to do with us now?&quot; &quot;My master must pay him for you,&quot; said Anyanwu's grandson loudly enough for Doro to hear. &quot;What has he to do with us now?&quot; &quot;My master must pay him for you,&quot; said Anyanwu. (Wild Seed 41) That just scans something awful. In all seriousness, though, rarely is the reason behind an editorial error so obvious or so indicative of an author's stylistic tics. In Wild Seed, Butler wed her characters to her prose, such that the latter's stolidity became evidence of the former's hard-fought restraint. (It is, after all, a novel about two people who spend their unnaturally long lives finding excuses not to murder each other.) She did so deliberately because, at this point in her career, she could. The novels were published in this order: Patternmaster (1976), Mind of My Mind (1977), Survivor (1978), Wild Seed (1980), Clay's Ark (1984); but they move through narrative time in this one: Wild Seed (1980), Mind of My Mind (1977), Clay's Ark (1984), Survivor (1978), Patternmaster (1976). I'll discuss how her interest in evolution is, fundamentally, a narrative one (and in so doing, discuss how this interest's inherent in all evolutionarily-inflected narratives, including Darwin's) at some point in the near future. For the moment, what fascinates me is how the elder Butler crafts the prose of the later novels in such a way that it &quot;develops&quot; into the style of the earliest one (Patternmaster). Were she actually a Dickian hack (&quot;sophisticated ideas communicated in pedestrian prose,&quot; as Consensus Q. Amalgam would have it), such a feat would be beyond her; but comparing the occasionally dense and ornate prose in Wild Seed (which shares formal concerns and historical content with 1979's Kindred) to the more direct, straightforward prose of Clay's Ark—written nearly half a decade later—it is difficult to imagine that the latter's resemblance to Patternmaster is anything other than intentional. When she was young, she couldn't help but write of the future in spare and quotidian manner; but by 1984, she could adopt a transitional voice, something that approximates in complexity the difference between 1977's Mind of My Mind and 1976's Patternmaster. While it may seem odd to call attention to the refinement of her narrative voice, it is essential to understanding the refinement of the thought processes it develops alongside: the series is unusual in that, as Butler said, she invented a society that was conceptually fascinating, but instead of going on to invent another, she became interested in how that one could possibly have come...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/10/mordre-wol-out-that-see-we-day-by-day.html"><span><strong>&quot;Mordre wol out, that see we day by day.&quot;</strong> During an extended discussion about the formal mechanics of the word-picture relation comics, I coined what I called &quot;Scott's Rule #23&quot;: [T]he percentage of time spent lecturing other people about how awesome you are is inversely propotional to your actual awesomeness.Which is to say, the decision to have one of the characters in your comic praise the cleverness of what another one said is supremely lame. At the time, I didn't think I needed to post Scott's Rule #22, what with it being so obvious, but today Chris Muir forced my hand: Or not. I think the lameness of having one of your characters enthusiastically egg on the lunatic rant of another requires no further definition. Toss in the fact that &quot;You're really cookin'&quot; is a painfully awful pun, and you're left thinking that Chaucer fellow I quoted in the title was onto something. If only someone would do something about Muir's crimes against the English language, freshmen logic, comedy and the comic form . .</span></a></div>
