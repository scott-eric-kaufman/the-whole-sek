<p>On a similarly somber subject, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/9179999">Badger</a> (of <a href="http://badbadbadger.blogspot.com/">Badgerings</a>) lost her husband last Monday.&nbsp; Even though I only know her through that most tenuous of tenuous connections (the polite acknowledgment of the link), I send my sympathies and (were I one to pray) all the prayers I know.&nbsp; But since I'm not one to pray I'll settle for sending my thoughts, so that she knows her husband's touched lives so distant, so removed, and will not be forgetton.&nbsp; (And while it may seem untoward to address her grief in so omnibus an entry, since I don't know when I'll have unfettered access again, I think the sentiment outweighs whatever violation of decorum I've committed.&nbsp; Best to you and yours in your time of trials, Badger.)</p>

<p>Come Monday I decided to attend this year's MLA (so that I've experienced one before I scour another for reasonable job offers) and have no idea how to follow through with this decision.&nbsp; Do I purchase a ticket, book a hotel room and wander from motel-to-hotel in search of thems that I know and thems that I'd like to?&nbsp; (<em>Paging Mr. McLemee, Mr. McCann, Mr. Blisset and other English-type-scholars who've experienced such archaic rites</em>.)&nbsp; Or do I dance like the fly-on-the-wall from one panel to the next and pray for a face I recognize?&nbsp; Is glomming onto the first friendly face considered impolitic?&nbsp; (If any readers or fellow Valveteers plan on attending, throw my sanity some life-preservers and spare me some sleepness nights.)</p>

<p><a href="http://mthollywood.blogspot.com/">John Bruce</a> continues to skewer others for those things from which he himself suffers so mightily: a overweening sense of self-importance, muddy prose mistakenly believed to be the very model of clarity, and above all presumptuous estimations of the quality of his own &quot;literary&quot; output, complete with imperinent declarations of his own superiority.&nbsp; (The standard for mocking middle-management, while low in literary circles, remains obscenely high in those of popular culture.&nbsp; Bruce's &quot;<a href="http://mthollywood.blogspot.com/2004/04/killer-app-i-i-had-been-at-digital.html">serialized blog novel</a>&quot; showcases his tin ear and absolute incomprehesion with a painfully unironic hammer which, if wielded by anyone else, would make meat of his gristle.&nbsp; Instead, we're treated to bland aggrandiziments of his petty pseudo-intellectual power-plays which conveniently double as &quot;literary&quot; forays into the culture of middle management.&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Bruce, you self-righteous self-important but utterly ignorant S.O.B., I have for you some words:</p>

<p>Perhaps you ought to ch-ch-check yourself before you wr-wr-wreck yourself.&nbsp; Or watch <em>Office Space </em>or <em>The Office</em> (preferably <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0315041/">Ricky Gervais</a>' BBC version, but its Americanization will suffice).&nbsp; Even someone as dense as you will realize how unsatisfying your satire's been in light of such shows.&nbsp; Not that I believe you'll admit as much, being the self-important presidium you ceaselessly declare yourself to be, but at the very least your bestial banality will eat away at you night and day (declarations otherwise notwithstanding), and that's satisfaction enough for me.&nbsp; (Actually, I know it won't, since you're too dense to see what the rest of the world can't avoid.)</p>



<p>In other news, the Little Womedievalist and I will still be in San Francisco come September 7th.&nbsp; Tickets for my NoCal performances are still avaible since it appears as if I know no locals but Ray and David.</p>

<p>Ugh.&nbsp; I have much more to say about Louisiana, <em><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0391198/">The Grudge</a></em>, <a href="http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/15003.html">recent posts on Cliopatria</a>, <a href="http://haloscan.com/tb/adamkotsko/112551438867283664">the Weblog</a>, and the <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/harmless_history/">Philip Roth</a> <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/fear_presides_over_these_memories_philip_roths_the_plot_against_america/">Festschrift</a> on <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go">The Valve</a>.&nbsp; As soon as my computer rejoins the land of the <del>living</del> spinning and cycling, I'll contribute to the Philip Roth festivities with an unbelievably erudite post whose detenebrative qualities will be remembered for generations. (I mean, really, I've had damn near two weeks to write it.&nbsp; How could something someone's spent <em>two weeks </em>on be anything less than brilliant?)</p>

		<span id="comment-9019942-content"><p>Well.  I certainly <i>hope</i> I&#39;m not going to the MLA this year, but Events may intervene (see under: search committees; presence on Appointments &amp; Tenure committee, usual results of).  To be honest, the MLA tends to be a lonely affair, unless you have People to See.  Perhaps your blog acquaintances may assist there; why not arrange a meetup? Does the English Department at UCI have a MLA party? </p>

<p>IMHO, the best part of the MLA is always the book exhibit, where you can find Many Cool Things.  (But then, you might expect that I&#39;d say that.)   </p>

<p>Also, attending the MLA always costs $$$, so be sure to share a room, find the nearest McDonald&#39;s, and stow bagels &amp; peanut butter in your room so that you don&#39;t have to spend even more $$$ on hotel breakfasts.  If you were on the market, I&#39;d strongly recommend staying in one of the conference hotels--there&#39;s something to be said for comfy surroundings when under stress--but as you aren&#39;t, head for the inexpensive hills.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-9051458-content"><p>I disagree with Sean in that if it were within convenient driving distance or if you were presenting a paper, then it would be worth going to. Also, if the cost of hotel and airplane ticket are insignificant to you, then you could get a feeling for what it&#39;s like. The weather will also likely be better than it was in San Diego, provided you like 40 degrees and raining.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-9058500-content"><p>I understand the impulse to go to MLA, but I echo what&#39;s being said above.  It&#39;s nice to go if it&#39;s convenient, and if you are going to give a paper that&#39;s a reason to go.  But MLA is also something that you will be able to manage fine when you are on the market, even if you haven&#39;t been before.  (Here&#39;s a hint for when you are on the market:  arrive on the 26th, a day early.)  MLA is a big event, but it&#39;s just a big overgrown conference, and you seem to have a lot of people who can prepare you for it.  Besides, when you go on the market, what you are really interested in are your interviews, and going this year won&#39;t get you into any of those interview rooms.</p></span>

Try again! (Which means: still can't access my computer or any of the files on it. Fun!) Brief but horrifying update on Louisiana: Everyone I know in Louisiana made it through, but many of them are now effectively homeless, without power, potable water, and are reporting having seen numerous bodies floating in the water in and around the New Orleans area.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/on_the_situatio.html"><span><strong>On the Situation Outside of New Orleans; or, My First Angry Political Rant</strong> I had written a long rant about the deteriorating conditions in my home state of Louisiana. I deleted it. Too much worrying over issues like gun control now that they've become topical. Friends of mine in Baton Rouge want to buy ammunition because they fear that the desperate evacuees from New Orleans may redirect their anger at the massive bureaucratic incompetence responsible for both the failure of the levees and the humanitarian crisis which followed. Redirect it at whom? The nearest available target. The family whose house was battered but not obliviated by the winds and the waves. The person whose credit line afforded them the opportunity to purchase gasoline and escape ahead of the landfall. The woman whose children and grandchildren aren't listed on the rolls of those missing and presumed (for now) unable to phone family and inform them they've weathered the storm. In other words, other victims of the massive bureaucratic incompetence responsible for both the failure of the levees and the humanitarian crisis which followed. Then there are those who will suffer from future bureaucratic incompetence, like those refugees lucky enough to escape one submerged parish or another only to be placed in a staging area in which riots between rival gangs from the Ninth and Seventeenth Wards have broken out. Regularly. For three days now. Perhaps placing people who've already endured unimaginable psychological stress in the same temporary shelters with people who've endured similar horrors but belong to rival gangs is less &quot;bad idea&quot; and more &quot;criminal negligence.&quot; It's not as if recent events and current privations would have these refugees working with triggers the adjective &quot;hair&quot; grossly overestimates. This material is representative of what I had written in the other post. Only not nearly so shrill. Or outraged. Or saddened. Or worried. In this entry I've tempered my temper. Refined my fire and been refined by it. I've choked all indications that I might think that having idealists who refuse reality as a reference point may be no better suited to address this crisis than the one they've established in Iraq. I'll probably delete this entry come morning, but I needed to vent. And have now. Twice. EDIT: Also outside of Louisiana--in Pass Christian, Mississippi, to be exact--a friend reports his parents' house was &quot;looted&quot; by armed men this morning. This. Is. Not. Good. EDIT II: This is one evil and depraved looter. EDIT III: I recieved a strange comment saying I should delete that second edit. Either 1) he didn't realize how bitterly sarcastic it was or 2) knows something more than I do about that particular looter and/or photograph but decided to be ambiguously menacing about it instead of sharing information. So I'll give this person from Maine (so says the IP address) the benefit of the doubt and say that I only posted a link to that picture because it struck me that calling someone with medical and hygenic supplies a &quot;looter.&quot; If that person had a stash of CK merchandise...</span></a></div>
