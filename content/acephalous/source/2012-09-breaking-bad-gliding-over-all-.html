			<p>(<em>This being another one of <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/02/scott-eric-kaufmans-visual-rhetoric-compendium-as-of-11282011.html" target="_self">those visual rhetoric posts</a>.</em>)</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had a week to digest the mid-season finale of <em>Breaking Bad</em>, &quot;Gliding All Over,&quot; and for the first time in weeks I&#39;m <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/08/realism-and-bad-manners-in-breaking-bad" target="_self">not going to talk</a> <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/08/breaking-bad-say-my-name-or-fine-maybe-dont-even-acknowledge-i-exist" target="_self">about kitchen tables</a>. The episode&#39;s title, &quot;Gliding Over All,&quot; references Walt Whitman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Gliding o&#39;er all, through all,</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Through Nature, Time, and Space,</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;">As a ship on the waters advancing,</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The voyage of the soul—not life alone,</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Death, many deaths I&#39;ll sing.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How is that relevant to the episode? Not in the way people online are discussing it. For one, I keep seeing it referred to as an ordinary &quot;poem,&quot; when in fact it appears, untitled, on the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=0uIIAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=RA2-PA1&amp;ots=TN83uFKNih&amp;dq=whitman%20%22passage%20to%20india%22%20%22gliding%20o&#39;er%20all%22&amp;pg=RA2-PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=whitman%20%22passage%20to%20india%22%20%22gliding%20o&#39;er%20all%22&amp;f=false" target="_self">title page of <em>Passage to India</em></a>. And the interpretations I&#39;ve read of its relation to the episode all focus on the &quot;many deaths&quot; because of Walter&#39;s increasing comfort with lethal force. But take a quick look at the actual poem that bit above introduces:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Singing my days,</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;">
Singing the great achievements of the present,</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Singing the strong, light works of engineers,</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Our modern wonders, (the antique ponderous Seven outvied,)</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In the Old World, the east, the Suez canal, </span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The New by its mighty railroad spann’d,</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The seas inlaid with eloquent, gentle wires[.]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Passage to India&quot; celebrates the connectedness of the world. These canals and transcontinental railroads and undersea telegraph cables have made it visible and tangible the connections between distant peoples. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">O voyagers, O scientists and inventors, [then] shall be justified,</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;">
All these hearts, as of fretted children, shall be sooth’d,</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;">
All affection shall be fully responded to—the secret shall be told;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;">All these separations and gaps shall be taken up, and hook’d and link’d together</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The voyagers and scientists and inventors create the conditions necessary to acquire a new kind of knowledge: one whose &quot;secret ... separations and gaps&quot; will be &quot;hook&#39;d and link&#39;d together.&quot; In short: titling the episode &quot;Gliding Over All&quot; doesn&#39;t allude to the untitled poem&#39;s &quot;many deaths&quot; but to the process of acquiring an interconnected vision of the world through technology that Whitman outlines in &quot;Passage to India.&quot; Given that Walter White and his contempories aren&#39;t in the midst of a world-shrinking communicative revolution, it stands to reason that they&#39;ll come into knowledge of how secrets are &quot;hook&#39;d and link&#39;d together&quot; differently. </p>
<p>Director Michelle MacLaren lets Walter have the first shot:</p>
<p>

<p>MacLaren opens with an extreme close-up on a fly. The shallow focus blurs the background to the extent that the only thing the audience can see is the fly. Because we want the shot to be meaningful, we begin to study the wings and shadows of this centrally positioned and obviously important fly. We try to connect this fly to some structure of meaning. Is this an allusion to &quot;the contamination&quot; that deviled Walter in &quot;The Fly&quot; and the extreme actions he and Jesse took to &quot;clean&quot; the lab? The camera lingers on the fly for seven seconds—long enough for these questions to arise but not long enough for them to be answer—before <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#53908" target="_self">racking focus</a> reveals that we&#39;re not the only ones trying to understand this fly:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31c728dd970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Breaking bad00006" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31c728dd970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31c728dd970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00006" /></a></p>
<p>Turns out the blurred &quot;background&quot; consisted of an extreme close-up of the top-half of Walter&#39;s face. Because the shot&#39;s level of framing is the height of a person sitting in a chair, we end up staring directly into Walter&#39;s eyes as he stares into ours. Except it can&#39;t be directly, because the fourth wall&#39;s intact, meaning Walter isn&#39;t staring <em>past</em> the fly, he&#39;s staring <em>at </em>the fly. Intently. He&#39;s studying the fly for meaning just as we did before the focus racked. The impression that he&#39;s staring <em>through </em>the fly—created by narrowing the depth of field in a way that blurs the fly invisible—is unsettling not only because it means that he might be menacing us, but also because it suggests that he sees some connection between himself and the fly that we failed to. He perceives the &quot;eloquent, gentle wires&quot; that connect him to that fly. </p>
<p>As well he should. There&#39;s a reason there&#39;s a fly in his office: Mike&#39;s remains rot in the trunk of Walter&#39;s car. He knows that knowledge of this fly&#39;s life-cycle could link him to Mike&#39;s murder by establishing a time of death. Even when Todd enters the room to inform him that he&#39;s disposed of Mike&#39;s car, Walter can&#39;t draw his eyes away:</p>
<p>

<p>This new world Walter inhabits requires a new breed of knowledge. Lest this discussion of eyeline matches and the connections they entail seem a little far-fetched, consider the last two shots in this scene:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31c73b89970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Breaking bad00024" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31c73b89970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31c73b89970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00024" /></a></p>
<p>Walter completes his intense study of the fly. When Walter stands and exits the shot to the right, MacLaren again racks the focus to reveal what the white blur behind Walter above is:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3bf595b1970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Breaking bad00024" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3bf595b1970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3bf595b1970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00024" /></a></p>
<p>Which <em>of course </em>includes a taxonomic chart of flies based on the geographic distruction and rate of maturation. It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochliomyia" target="_self">a secondary screwworm fly</a>, meaning it only consumes necrotic tissue. Its presence connects Walter to the corpse decomposing in his trunk. We now know that this fly is unrelated to the one that taxed Walter in &quot;The Fly,&quot; because that fly represented Walter&#39;s inability to maintain the illusion of an orderly world: he didn&#39;t know how it entered the lab and found himself powerless to remove it from it. But this fly? He knows exactly why it&#39;s there and exactly how to encourage it to leave. Its presence doesn&#39;t represent a disorderly incursion into Walter&#39;s orderly world but the extent to which Walter&#39;s come to define &quot;orderly&quot; differently: if he can see the connections he can control them and his mind &quot;shall be sooth&#39;d.&quot;</p>
<p>The idea established in this opening scene—that Walter has the power to acquire &quot;secret&quot; knowledge about connections in the world by staring at them intensely—is undermined when Skyler insists he accompany her to a storage facility. After they enter the unit, Skyler pulls aside a sheet. Instead of revealing what Skyler&#39;s uncovered, MacLaren cuts to a medium close-up of Walter&#39;s face:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3bf5b25d970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Breaking bad00147" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3bf5b25d970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3bf5b25d970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00147" /></a></p>
<p>Within a given episode of any well-directed television, the director will establish associations between particular shots and particular narrative elements. In the opening scene, MacLaren creates a correlation between extreme close-ups and a knowledgable mastery of the world. She combines a medium close-up of Walter with the expression on his face to indicate to us that this Walter can&#39;t fathom &quot;these separations and gaps.&quot; He can&#39;t connect what he sees to the world he knows, and no wonder:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744a50815970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Breaking bad00147" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017744a50815970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744a50815970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00147" /></a></p>
<p>He&#39;s staring at a sublime amount of money. And I mean &quot;sublime&quot; as Kant meant it: it&#39;s a mathematical sublime, the effect of encountering an object whose greatness is unencumbered by the very idea of limitations. (Which is precisely the conversation Skyler and Walter have about how much money lives in that pile. They can&#39;t even imagine a way to count it.) Note that when the camera reversed the shot scale increased again. Walter&#39;s now in a classic medium shot here and when it reverses again:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31c758f3970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Breaking bad00147" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31c758f3970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31c758f3970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00147" /></a></p>
<p>The progressive lengthening of the shot scale suggests that Walter&#39;s becoming increasingly incapable of connecting this pile of money to the world as he understands it. Unlike the fly, this pile of money can&#39;t be categorized and put in its place: the pile lives in the storage unit because its size makes it impossible to launder its incomprehensible worth. Walter is shocked out of his fantasy of mastery-through-knowledge by an unknowable pile of money. That he decides to abandon the trade soon after encountering the sublime isn&#39;t surprising: his continued participation was predicated on his belief that he could out-understand his competitors. Now he can&#39;t even connect his labor to his capital.</p>
<p>These are but two moments in the episode in which this dynamic plays out. Tomorrow I&#39;ll discuss the most literal link between the episode and Whitman&#39;s paean to global shipping: the conversation between Walter and Lydia in the diner. </p>

Why do I need to know? No reason, no reason.</strong> [My response to the Inside Higher Ed article can be found here.] It has come to my attention that I’m now too old and too experienced to be hired to do my job. Consider the “Required Qualifications” of this listing for a position at Colorado State University: Ph.D. in English or American Studies or closely related area awarded between 2010 and time of appointment. A promising record of scholarship/research in pre-1900 American literature and culture. Ability to teach a range of subjects in American literature and culture between 1600 and 1900. For years our “betters” have told those of up who earned our degrees between 2005 and 2010 that we needed to do whatever we could to survive—adjunct or lecture or accept positions at community colleges—and that when the market turned around we wouldn’t be punished for having done so. Seems we were lied to. If institutions require candidates who earned their doctorate after 2010, it indicates that they’ve embraced the idea that there’s a Lost Generation of scholars out there. A Generation so embittered by the paucity of prospects and the years spent toiling in academic recesses that its members can’t ever be reintegrated into a functioning department. We—I earned my doctorate in 2008—have been tainted by market forces beyond our control, but instead of bucking the inherently flawed system as they do in words and print, these aggressively benevolent &quot;betters&quot; are conceding that they’re powerless to do anything for this Generation in deeds. “It’s not up to us,” they say. (Only it is.) “There’s nothing we can do about it,” they say. (Only they can.) “If you’d landed a job in 2009 this wouldn’t have been a problem,” they say. (Only there weren’t any jobs in 2009 and they damn well know that.) In short: the jobs promised to the Lost Generation are being outsourced to younger and prettier scholars for no particularly compelling reason, except that the younger and prettier scholars are younger and prettier. As Chad Black noted in the linked post, it’s not that there hasn’t always been a bias against those who don’t land a tenure track job after three years, it’s just depressing to see it codified in an advertisement—especially in light of what our &quot;betters&quot; have been telling about what will happen when the market turns around.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/09/-we-were-told-to-ride-out-the-storm-but-it-seems-we-were-lied-to-.html"><span><strong> “We were told to ride out the storm, but it seems we were lied to[.]”  </strong> That's a handsome quotation from the Inside Higher Ed article about the Colorado State University ad discussed yesterday. From the article: Louann Reid, chair of English at Colorado State, sees it differently. When asked if the ad discriminated against adjuncts, she said her department is seeking an entry-level professor with an entry-level salary and expectations, and added that the posting was approved by the university’s office of equal opportunity. There's a strange disconnect because the question—does the ad discriminate against adjuncts?—and Reid's answer—the department wants to hire an entry-level professor with an entry-level salary and expectations. Do adjuncts not have entry-level salary expectations? Because I'm a short step above an adjunct and I can assure you that my salary expectations are entry-level. In a response Chad Black's email, Reid made clear the reasoning behind that disconnect: By specifying &quot;between 2010 and time of appointment&quot; we indicated that we are interested in applicants with up to three years in a tenure-track position as well as those who are just beginning their careers. So they want their pool of applicants to consist of (1) the fortunate few who landed a tenure-track position between 2005 and 2009 and (2) those people who happened to finish their doctorate after 2010. Notice who's absent from their ideal pool? Everyone who wasn't fortunate enough to land a tenure-track position in the worst academic job market in recent memory. It seems like Colorado State wants to punish undeserving scholars for the crimes of having to pay rent and eat during an economic downturn. But it's doubly cruel considering the fact that the hiring committees whose lines were plucked out from under them told applicants that the disappearance of the positions to which they'd applied wouldn't have any impact on their future in the profession. Because as this callous ad demonstrates, it clearly did. Colorado State thinks the fact that schools didn't have jobs to offer from 2005 to 2009 speaks poorly of applicants who failed to land non-existent jobs. To which I can only say nothing because we're in polite company. UPDATE: Turns out sending pesky emails to the President of my professional organziation pays dividends: In the Q&amp;A, Bérubé said the CSU ad issue has been put on the MLA Exec Com agenda, and the MLA is un-approving the ad. @scottekaufman — Chad Black (@parezcoydigo) September 11, 2012</span></a></div>
