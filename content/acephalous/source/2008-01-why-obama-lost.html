 had been common knowledge for many weeks that Clinton was using an exotic brand of speed known as Wallot ... 
and it had long been whispered that Obama was into something very heavy, but it was hard to take the talk seriously until I heard about the appearance of a mysterious Brazilian doctor. That was the key.&nbsp; Barack discussed the cocaine question for the dope-smoking students in Manchester, moments before refusing to snort himself.&nbsp; Later that night, however, it was reported that Senator Obama was a known user of a powerful drug called Ibogaine.</p>

<p>I immediately recognized The Ibogaine Effect—from Obama's near-breakdown on the flatbed truck in Iowa, the delusions and altered thinking that characterized his campaign in New Hampshire, and finally the condition of &quot;total rage&quot; that gripped him in Ohio.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it: The Savior from Illinois had turned to massive doses of Ibogaine as a last resort. The only remaining question was &quot;when did he start?&quot;&nbsp; But nobody could answer this one, and I was not able to press the candidate himself for an answer because I was permanently barred from the Obama campaign after that incident on the &quot;Tall Corn Special&quot; in Iowa ... and that scene makes far more sense now than it did at the time.&nbsp; Obama has always taken pride in his ability to deal with hecklers; he has frequently challenged them, calling them up to the stage in front of big crowds and then forcing the poor bastards to debate with him in a blaze of TV lights.</p>

<p>It is entirely conceivable—given the known effects of Ibogaine—that Obama's brain was almost paralyzed by hallucinations at the time; 
that he looked out at that crowd and saw gila monsters instead of people, and that his mind snapped completely when he felt something large and apparently vicious clawing at his legs.&nbsp; We can only speculate on this, because those in a position to know have flatly refused to comment on rumors concerning the Senator's disastrous experiments with Ibogaine.&nbsp; I tried to find the Brazilian doctor on election night, but by the time the polls closed he was long gone.&nbsp; One of the hired bimbos in Manchester's Holiday Inn headquarters said a man with fresh welts on his head had been dragged out the side door and put on a bus to Chicago, but we were never able to confirm this.</p>

Sorry, I should have noted that it was fixed now.  By the time I read Scott&#39;s post I was back to seeing what he sees (at least in this particular context).  Before it was taking random names and phrases and linking them to other random Amazon items (well, not entirely random, but certainly not what would come up first on a search).</p></span>

I'm also placing it below-the-fold. That's probably obvious though, isn't it?] Chris Clarke, Ilyka Damen, BFP, et al. have repeatedly demonstrated the failings of Hugo's tepid defense of a tired feminism. No one needs me to recount the festivities. But I want to pick up on something Chris wrote—in response to something Rich wrote—about the intent behind calling someone envious: I’m in the general group of writers charged with being envious of other bloggers' &quot;success,&quot; and yet some of the people making those accusations know full well I repudiated exactly that kind of &quot;success&quot; in the last year. The same cannot be said of Hugo. It is apparent to anyone with Firefox what constitutes success for him: Having trouble reading that? Let me highlight it for you: Hugo has a sound reason to start fights, to pick scabs, to hold and periodically renew grudges: Fat people can't spell. He cares enough not to insult them directly—they're already fat, after all. What would happen to their self-esteem were Hugo to remind them they're also illiterate? So he kindly hides his concern in the for obese idiots in the header of his blog. When their sagging asses and bulging guts click on his site, they might not see evidence of his concern, but he hopes his message of Phentermine Love penetrates the folds and flaps of flab and communes with the thin person buried deep within. Ignoring him would undermine his ability to peddle his kindness. It would be a tacit admission that you hate fat people (literate or otherwise). So please, by all means, continue to take him seriously, continue to engage him as if his motives were as stated, lest you reveal yourself to hate the fatties Hugo so desperately wants to help.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/01/hire-me-im-prod.html"><span><strong>Hire Me, I'm (Productively) Oblivious</strong> How often do I leave the apartment? Not very often. When I first drove to California, I passed by the largest doors I'd ever seen. Their scale defined my postmodern condition (in that Jamesonian way): I lack the words to communicate the scale of this blimp hanger. Skyscrapers may shoot into the sky, but they do so thinly, lightly, and seemingly without weight. These hangers (as there are two) were hulking presences designed to remind all those who saw them of their place. Adding to the intimidation was that they were located in the middle of nothing: The giantic things casting shadows? That would them. So you can imagine my surprise when, yesterday afternoon, I drove down that way and found my view of these quiet monsters obstructed by a mall. Since last I drove down this direction—a mere mile and a half from my apartment—someone built a mall: Best Buy, Ulta, Whole Foods, TJ Maxx, an AMC cineplex and dozens upon dozens of restaurants stood between me and my quotidian sublime. How did that happen? Easy: I never leave the apartment. I'm so devoted to my work they can erect a mall within earshot and I won't bat an eye. I possess the attractive obliviousness you desire and you want to hire me. Now. You want to hire me. Now. Now what is it you want?</span></a></div>
