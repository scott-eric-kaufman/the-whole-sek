<p>Every Scripture and every Myth is defined with a clarity that defies misunderstanding.&nbsp; And perhaps even more important, here for the first time is a dictionary that treats the definition of the Scriptures according to the intentions of the original writers.

</p>

<p>Nowhere else can you find a book that deals as broadly and as completely with religious concepts as literature.&nbsp; And for each term, the DICTIONARY OF ALL SCRIPTURES AND MYTHS brings you:

</p>

<ul><li><em>Clear explanations of the symbolism of ancient and modern religious words and phrases</em></li>

<li><em>Numerous quotations from authoritative sources</em></li>

<li><em>Thoughtful descriptions of the meaning of the terms and how they are used in Myths and Scriptures</em></li>

<li><em>Complete cross reference</em> </li></ul>

<p>The discovery of a metaphorical language underlying all sacred Scriptures of the world prompted Mr. Gaskell to write this dictionary which gives a more complete knowledge of man's inner nature and the purpose of his life on earth than was heretofore possible.</p></blockquote>

<p>For the first time ever, I resisted the urge to interleave complete, authoritative Sarcasm into the body of the quotation.&nbsp; Nowhere else will I defy my inner nature and the purpose of my life with such complete Restraint than in this authoritative post.&nbsp; Why?</p>

				<p>Its (many) problematic assumptions aside, Gaskell's compendium of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594482225/diesekoschmar-20">COMPLETE WORLD KNOWLEDGE</a> oozes erudition.&nbsp; The dust jacket again:</p><blockquote><p>For instance under the phrase &quot;Image of God,&quot; Mr. Gaskell quotes from the Bible, T. Aquinas, Harnack's <em>History of Dogma</em>, G.T. Ladd's <em>Philosophy of Religion</em>, C. Taylor's <em>Sayings of the Jewish Fathers</em>, and many more sources.</p></blockquote><p>Reading
that list and pondering its many more sources—among them, A. Jukes, J.
Bunyan, G. Milmine, I. Myer and the illustrious M.B. Eddy—you wouldn't
particularly think this erudition would be all that much to fun to
acquire secondhand.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You'd be wrong.</p>

<p>Absent from these descriptions is any hint of the joy to be derived
from the skimming of this tome.&nbsp; All those literary scholars might be
completely wrong about the entertainment value of Casaubon's dessicated
monument to Christian syncretism.&nbsp; To draw the comparison more
directly, Gaskell's readers will be entranced, Dorothea-like, not by
the material or the manner of its revelation, but by the
correspondences a mind overstuffed with information invariably
produces.&nbsp; For example:</p><blockquote><p><strong>DESERTS, VAST AND UNKNOWN :—</strong></p>


<p><strong>Symbolic of primordial chaos</strong><strong>—the infinite expanse of<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; formless matter.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> &quot;Pwan-koo is described as
appearing from the vast unknown deserts.&nbsp; He was four times taller than
man, had horns on his head, and teeth protruding from his mouth.&quot;—Kidd,
<em>China</em>, p.100.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Logos proceeds from the Chaos or Depth.&nbsp; The statement about
height, refers to the fact that the measure of a man, or ego,
comprehends the five planes of his being, upon four of which he has not
yet become fully conscious.&nbsp; The &quot;horns&quot; symbolize victory: they are
the sign of the One who conquers the conditions of the planes.&nbsp; The
&quot;Lamb&quot; or &quot;Ram,&quot; &quot;slain from the world's foundation,&quot; possesses the
same symbol.&nbsp; The &quot;teeth&quot; symbolize power of expression,—the potential
becoming the actual,—the force of that which is uttered in the Divine
Fiat or Spoken Word.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 0.9em;"><em>See </em>ABYSS, CHAOS, DEEP, FANG, FOUR TIMES, HEAVEN AND EARTH, HEIGHT (OSIRIS), HORNS, LAMB OF GOD, MEASURE, PWANKOO, STEM, TEETH, TUSK</span></p></blockquote>

<p>&quot;Deserts, Vast and Unknown&quot; brims over with what Gaskell calls
&quot;undermeanings.&quot;&nbsp; Without them, the universality his dictionary reveals
to have been revealed would evaporate.&nbsp; It is these &quot;undermeanings&quot;
that prove him to be, as Dorothea said of Casaubon, &quot;a man whose
learning almost amounted to a proof of whatever he believed.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

		<span id="comment-27330391-content"><p>Well, yeah, a man&#39;s reach should definitely exceed his grasp, and I&#39;m temperamentally attracted to the <i>idea</i> of ambitious summas of all kinds. Accordingly, I find myself drawn to Gaskell&#39;s hypertrophic panopticism (as he might say). Alas, God (or the devil) is always in the details, and while watching someone making these bold speculative connections is fun for a time, the connections are never, in the root sense, <i>necessary</i>, i.e., you could replace them with another equally plausible set of connections. After a while the whole Big-Picture thing just strikes me as an exercise in misplaced ingenuity, rather like passing gas through a keyhole. Or as Dr. Johnson said in another context, &quot;It is not done well, but you are surprised to find it done at all.&quot; </p></span>

What they had seen, the NEO declared, were the remains of a spent Russian rocket booster falling to earth. NORAD officials could not confirm the NEO’s account, citing discrepancies between the time the Russian SL-4 booster reportedly crashed in Riverton, Wyoming and the accounts of Kaufman and other credible witnesses. &quot;Seeing how the Russian booster went down and stayed down around 6 a.m. Monday morning,&quot; said NORAD’s Seau de Honnêteté, &quot;the odds of it being the thing reported today are slim.&quot; De Honnêteté characterizes the NEO’s response to the situation as &quot;stunningly unoptimal—a grave underestimation of the megacatastophic power of a planet-killer three times hotter than the sun.&quot; De Vuurst’s NEO colleague, Dr. Gesam T. Verwüstung, disagrees. &quot;An impact of that magnitude could vaporize the East Coast, rend the very fabric of civilization, but such an outcome is improbable. Most likely, women and liberals will complain.&quot; Should you see this object as it makes it way to University Park, authorities ask that you immediately commemorate its passage on your local Internets.

The feedback I received at the conference was overwhelmingly positive. If I finish my dissertation in the next nine months, I see little reason to think my online activities will have a negative effect on my hireability. This is not to say that I believe they will have a positive effect—as Bérubé noted during the Q&amp;A to the first blogging panel, a blog is not something to list on your CV. Still, none of the luminaries I spoke to at the MLA believed blogs inherently unscholarly. (A few have even emailed me in the days since asking for advice on the various blogging platforms.) We've made some progress on this count. But at what cost? The distinction between &quot;academics who blog&quot; and &quot;academic blogs&quot; ought to be insisted upon. The value of anonymous blogs in which a community celebrates/commiserates/communicates the minutiae of academic life has been underestimated (at least by me). The (seemingly) sudden disappearance of a number of blogs and bloggers who were well established when I arrived on the scene speaks to the possibility that &quot;academic blogging&quot; is strangling the life from &quot;academics who blog.&quot; Careerists like myself may unwittingly pressure &quot;academics who blog&quot; into thinking their blogs must be more than mere blogs to justify their existence. I don't think that the case, and would hate to feel responsible for changing the environs in such a way that would make people uncomfortable. And yet, I do feel responsible. Perhaps because: Blogging has made me a nicer person. Strange as it may sound, a number of people were shocked by how &quot;nice&quot; a person I am. Something about blogging has transformed the asshole you know and love into a kind and (according to a couple of people) &quot;surprisingly young&quot; gentleman. (Do I write old? Don't answer that. I don't want to know.) The former is particularly amusing given that, as one correspondent insisted, the panel (and its success) should've reinforced my native &quot;asshole-ishness.&quot; The MLA should've marked my ego's coming-of-age, should've been its extended coming-out party. Instead, I foolishly wasted those days being polite, humble and modest, much like those before and after the convention. Had someone informed me prior to the panel of these expectations, I would've behaved hideously. Instead, I transformed myself into a dim lummox: Thinking about blogging and academia has made me a dull blogger. When all you do for a couple weeks is theorize your life and its relation to your career, it stands to reason you'll tire of both. And I have. I'm so oppressed by the tyranny of the meta- that mere blogging seems inadequate unless I include a proper justificatory framework for it. (Like the one framing the reproduction of my talk.) Solipsistic meta- posts are as dull to write as they are to read, though, so after this one I'm banishing such thoughts from my mind. Once I resume researching and writing—tomorrow, I attack!—the urge to write dull posts will be drowned beneath the...</span></a></div>
