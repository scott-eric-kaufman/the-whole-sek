Before I get started, who says &quot;English Department professor&quot;? None of the &quot;English Department professors&quot; I know would call themselves or their fellows that. It's the equivalent of a &quot;knowledgeable&quot; baseball fan complaining about opposing teams &quot;sacrifice walking&quot; Barry Bonds. Cowboy's unfamiliarity with the lingo gives up the game from the start. But humor him, as he's about to humor us: You might be an English Department professor if... You think Marx was reasonable— Your last article was on the literary value of a grocery list— You believe Moby Dick isn't worth reading— But that the Porky's movies are culturally revealing— Your superpower is the ability to make students hate great literature— You think Sylvia Plath is anything other than just sad— You hate, and I mean really hate, Ted Hughes but can't name one of his poems.

A work need not be artistic to be culturally revealing. Consider the popularity of the equally (if differently) odious Left Behind series. It's no more literary than Porky's, but it's certainly culturally revealing, given that its popularity accompanied (or pushed, or was driven by) a swell of evangelicalism. Of course, attempting to provide an intelligent account of why popular things are popular, now or historically, falls under the rubric of &quot;cultural studies,&quot; i.e. the phrase no one but an &quot;English Department professor&quot; can look in a mirror and utter without laughing. Like &quot;but shrug ant farm,&quot; the phrase is inherently funny. Only, what's so funny about that? Granted, Foxworthy's shtick is inherently unfunny. I only think this because I'm an elitist, obviously. I don't know from low humor. I'm all like &quot;if it lacks the pathos of the Sad Clown, it will win no chuckles from me.&quot; Still, assuming there's a universe in which the likes of Jay Leno are funny, &quot;cultural studies&quot; isn't a funny punchline. I spent ten minutes looking in the mirror saying it, and not only was it not funny, it got progressively unfunnier before teetering into absurdity as I stood there saying &quot;Chet. Chet...." />

<p>You hate, and I mean really hate, Ted Hughes but can't name one of his poems.</p>

<p>You think the culture wars are over ... and you won.</p>

<p>You think a rifle is the same as a shotgun.</p>

<p>You can look in the mirror and say any of these without cracking up:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Visual rhetoric.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Technological literacy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gender studies.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, attempting to provide an intelligent account of why popular things are popular, now or historically, falls under the rubric of &quot;cultural studies,&quot; <em>i.e. </em>the phrase no one but an &quot;English Department professor&quot; can look in a mirror and utter without laughing.&nbsp; Like &quot;<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/man-has-always-.html">but shrug ant farm</a>,&quot; the phrase is inherently funny.&nbsp; Only, what's so funny about that?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Granted, Foxworthy's shtick is inherently unfunny.&nbsp; I only think this because I'm an elitist, obviously.&nbsp; I don't know from <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my_morning.html">low humor</a>.&nbsp; I'm all like &quot;if it lacks the pathos of the Sad Clown, it will win no chuckles from me.&quot;&nbsp; Still, assuming there's a universe in which the likes of Jay Leno are funny, &quot;cultural studies&quot; isn't a funny punchline.&nbsp; I spent ten minutes looking in the mirror saying it, and not only was it not funny, it got progressively unfunnier before teetering into absurdity as I stood there saying &quot;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113537/">Chet.&nbsp; Chet.&nbsp; Chet.</a>&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>Then</em> I laughed.</p>

<p>So I thought we'd be able to generate a Foxworthian list that does Cowboy and Foxworthy one better by actually being funny.&nbsp; I'll start us off:</p><blockquote><p><em>You might be a current/future English professor if...</em></p><blockquote><p>No one understands you when you talk about Rimbaud.</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><em>You might be a current/future English professor if...</em>

<blockquote>Niceness counts, you know.</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Doesn&#39;t quite cut it.  We need more <em>strict</em>, <em>stringent</em>, <em>angry</em>, comp. instructors.  &quot;Niceness&quot; is a quality that should be limited to grandmothers and puppies.  It&#39;s not sound criteria for English profs.  </p>

<p>As for English profs and Rimbaud, well, just because they ought not be teaching him -- which claim&#39;s itself debatable, esp. if you buy into classical theories of liberal education, which includes training in languages other than English -- doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t read him.  Most of the folks I know have, and most of the people they&#39;ve talked to outside &quot;English Department professors&quot; about him <em>are</em> confused.  </p>

<p>They&#39;re waiting for explosions ... but <em>alas!</em> they never come.</p></span>

<p>...Honestly, this is the second post now on conservative blogging that has mainly just left me very confused about what conservative bloggers are even talking about or arguing about. The themes come across clearly enough (sorry for commenting here about the Protein Wisdom post rather than the eventual comment on which you based <i>your</i> amusing post), themes like inaccuracy and hypocrisy on the part of the Left, but the counterstrikes are based on such faulty logic that it&#39;s hard to grasp them. For example, in one post you have the idea that a contest for hottest DC insider is relevant to the overall quality of American journalism. In another, you have some guy who is apparently thoroughly untroubled about gender roles acting as though all conservatives feel the same way, and then (strangely) bringing teaching into the conversation out of nowhere. Which is how we get to that comment.</p></span>

<p>It takes you twenty minutes to figure out you don&#39;t mean the same thing as your friends when you say &quot;Of course I like Jameson&quot;</p>

<p>You have ever taken a marker to the &quot;Thank&#39;s Come Again&quot; sign on a McDonald&#39;s door</p>

<p>You think words have precise meanings and</p>

<p>Care about parsing out what those meanings are</p>

<p>Reading what dead people have written about <i>Tristram Shandy</i> sounds like fun</p>

<p>You have ever written a poem, a filk, or sang something by Emily Dickinson to the tune of &quot;Gilligan&#39;s Island&quot;</p>

<p>It pains you deeply when students throw away their essays without reading the comments</p>

<p>You have been caught in the hallways discussing the latest NYT article in terms of rhetorical analysis</p>

<p>You have gone to a Halloween party dressed as your favorite literary character, author, or theorist</p>

<p>(you are &quot;The Crazy English Professor&quot; if you have shown up to teach class dressed as the above)</p>

<p>You can&#39;t help making snarky puns on Shakespearean phrases when the context comes up</p>

<p>You can&#39;t pay (or find?) your credit card bill but your subscriptions to the New Yorker and Atlantic Monthly are up to date (NLR and The Nation work as well)</p>

<p>Likewise you can drop $300 on books in a single trip but you gripe about the cost of an oil change</p>

<p>The poem about <a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/pike/" rel="nofollow">the pike</a> makes you smile, <a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/pike/" rel="nofollow">&quot;Lovesong&quot; </a> makes you shiver, <a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/daffodils-2/" rel="nofollow">&quot;Daffodils&quot; </a> makes you cry</p>

<p>(and I have to agree with him that <i>Moby Friggin&#39; Dick</i> is not worth reading. Bleah!)</p></span>

<p>Oh, and Mr Kugelmass?  The whole &quot;I&#39;m at a loss to figure out what conservative bloggers are getting at, given their faulty logic (which there&#39;s no need to actually point out, you see - their being conservative, and so the faulty logic, wink wink nudge nudge, being understood by all the right kinds of people as a given&quot; pose is really rather trite.</p>

<p>You may or may not know that Scott here has guest posted at the site.  As have other liberals.  So you might want to avoid the broad brush.  </p>

<p>...you&#39;ve not yet read several of the books on your intro to Western Lit course, but you&#39;re sure you already know more about them than your students do [in my case: <i>Emma</i> and <i>Moll Flanders</i>]</p>

<p>...you apologize on the first day of a Bible as Literature course for not knowing Greek (here you labor over whether or not you should say &quot;Koine&quot;), Aramaic, or Hebrew, but you&#39;re nonetheless sure you know more about the Tanakh than your students who routinely read Hebrew</p>

<p>..you think the very best introduction to a Medieval Lit survey is Chaucer&#39;s &quot;The Former Age,&quot; whose obscurity you think is best illustrated by the fact that there have been probably fewer than 20 articles published on it in the last 100 years.</p>

<p>[sorry. Not very funny, but certainly very emblematic. I&#39;m no Sisyphus. And Jeff G: it may be &quot;trite,&quot; but in this case, as in most: the shoe fits. Have a Ball.]</p>

<p>(and re: Cowboy&#39;s profession. I suppose he <i>could</i> be an English Professor. After all, GWB is President. But he&#39;s not exactly the brightest bulb in the barrel, the sharpest monkey in the basket, &amp;c. I squabbled with him <a href="http://pandagon.blogsome.com/2007/08/21/shorter-jeff-goldstein/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and found his reading comprehension skills pretty sad (e.g., compare his comment 36 to my 50).</p></span>

<p>It just introduces more confusion to consider why <br />
Scott has ever bothered to do so, given the vapidity of your posts and your commenters.  It seems to have originated in a feeling that Atrios was picking on a fellow English dude, and I assume that Scott can&#39;t admit that he&#39;s since learned that Atrios was correct in this case.</p>

<p>At any rate, I can&#39;t suggest more for the thread, not being now nor ever having been an English professor.  But with regard to &quot;It takes you twenty minutes to figure out you don&#39;t mean the same thing as your friends when you say &#39;Of course I like Jameson&#39;&quot;, I once read most of a Sean McCann Valve post about Bill Burroughs thinking that he was writing about E.R. Burroughs.</p></span>

<p><i>The whole &quot;I&#39;m at a loss to figure out what conservative bloggers are getting at, given their faulty logic (which there&#39;s no need to actually point out, you see - their being conservative, and so the faulty logic, wink wink nudge nudge, being understood by all the right kinds of people as a given&quot; pose is really rather trite.</i></p>

<p>Actually, misquoting me (scare quotes and everything) and dropping half my comment (where I do explain what I mean) is pathetic. Yeah, I realize that Scott has posted at Protein Wisdom.  The fact that you seem to think Protein Wisdom deserves a gold medal for it doesn&#39;t prove much besides the known fact that Scott makes occasional, valuable contributions to political debate online.</p></span>

Friends of this year's two [...] winners built software &quot;bots&quot; that voted thousands of times for each of them on the Mediabistro site. &quot;I once had a girlfriend who quit journalism and went into P.R. because she said public-relations work was 'more ethical,'&quot; he writes. I'm inclined to agree. That an online poll by a media site was so easily rigged is more evidence of pervasive, perfidious liberal bias. As Michael Silence writes, that the &quot;media [is] caught cheating&quot; is another hit to its credibility, further evidence of its liberal bias. One problem with this scenario: I'm not the media. You heard me right: I actively participated in the rigging of an online poll ... concerning the &quot;hottest&quot; media type in D.C.. I am become Liberal Media. I aided Capps and Andrews. I admit it. Other people aided their friends. They admit it. So I can only ask: This is what elicits Reynolds' patented &quot;sigh&quot;? Then I remember: It's all about The Narrative. Must remind readers of The Narrative. Can't let people forget The Narrative. The Narrative may not obtain—it may even be hilariously irrelevant, as here—but it's still The Narrative. Its fires must be stoked, its hunger must be slaked, its every need must be fulfilled, lest it wither before the face of its fundamental untruth. This reminds me of the old joke: How do you get to be a popular blogger? Hit the bottom of the barrel, then keep on going.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/more-on-kc-john.html"><span><strong>More on KC Johnson's Durham in Wonderland; or, &quot;Horowitzian,&quot; adj.</strong> KC Johnson was bemused by my characterization of his argument as &quot;Horowitzian,&quot; because, it seems, one can't share argumentative tics with someone who's publicly denounced you. But Timothy's comments further down what has turned into quite an exceptional thread have helped me hone my complaint against KC vis-a-vis his Horowitzian tendencies. His recent post about Duke University Press provides a paradigmatic example. He writes: In looking through the Group [of 88]'s c.v.'s, an interesting pattern emerges: sixteen have published books with Duke University Press. One of those sixteen is Priscilla Wald—who, as I mentioned earlier, was the impetus behind my first post—as her Constituting Americans: Cultural Anxiety and Narrative Form was published by DUP in 1994. According to this profile of her, she wasn't hired by Duke until 2000. What Johnson considers invidious, then, is that Wald now works for the institution whose university press published her book six years earlier. That Johnson fails to note that is telling. Also omitted is that it's published under the aegis of Donald Pease's prestigious New Americanist series. While KC would preface half its number with a &quot;[naturally],&quot; the New Americanist series is the series for Americanists. It published my advisor's book (New Deal Modernism: American Literature and the Invention of the Welfare State) as well as Sean McCann's Gumshoe America: Hard-Boiled Crime Fiction and the Rise and Fall of New Deal Liberalism, both solid works of literary historicism. Timothy's comment captures why they would want to publish with DUP even if they were currently employed by Duke: One reason that I think someone might publish with their &quot;home&quot; press is simply that it's the best or most reputable press in the subject area that they're publishing in. Duke is certainly one of the top presses in cultural studies and cultural history, for example. If I were at the University of Ohio, for example, it would be strange not to consider publishing with the very prestigious Social History of Africa series that has moved to that press from Heinemann. So Wald's crime, KC suggests, is publishing Constituting Americans with the most reputable press in her field a full six years before being hired by Duke. I sleuthed all these facts in five minutes, but in the course of writing a book, KC somehow failed to come across them? I don't think so, and this is what disturbs me. As Timothy writes (again regarding the character of university presses) in another comment: Different scholarly publishers definitely have an identity, a particular reputation with regard to specialization, and KC knows that perfectly well. At least I hope he does: it's a pretty basic facet of the scholarly world. The emphasis is mine, because that phrase captures the definition of &quot;Horowitzian.&quot; To wit: Horowitzian, adj. (of a writer) belonging to or characteristic of David Horowitz, esp. as regards intentionally withholding profession-specific information when speaking before a general audience in order to incite it to commit acts of rhetorical violence. This is the Ur-Horowitzian move, and if...</span></a></div>
