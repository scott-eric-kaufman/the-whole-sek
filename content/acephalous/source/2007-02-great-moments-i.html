This raised a problem which I first solved in the following way. I had say sixteen stones, four in each of my four pockets these being the two pockets of my trousers and the two pockets of my greatcoat. Taking a stone from the right pocket of my greatcoat, and putting it in my mouth, I replaced it in the right pocket of my greatcoat by a stone from the right pocket of my trousers, which I replaced by a stone from the left pocket of my trousers, which I replaced by a stone from the left pocket of my greatcoat, which I replaced by the stone which was in my mouth, as soon as I had finished sucking it. Thus there were still four stones in each of my four pockets, but not quite the same stones. And when the desire to suck took hold of me again, I drew again on the right pocket of my greatcoat, certain of not taking the same stone as the last time. And while I sucked it I rearranged the other stones in the way I have just described. And so on. But this solution did not satisfy me fully. For it did not escape me that, by an extraordinary hazard, the four stones circulating thus might always be the same four. In which case, far from sucking the sixteen stones turn and turn about, I was really only sucking four, always the same, turn and turn about. But I shuffled them well in my pockets, before I began to suck, and again, while I sucked, before transferring them, in the hope of obtaining a more general circulation of the stones from pocket to pocket.

All (all!) that was necessary was to put for example, to begin with, six stones in the right pocket of my greatcoat, or supply-pocket, five in the right pocket of my trousers, and five in the left pocket of my trousers, that makes the lot, twice five ten plus six sixteen, and none, for none remained, in the left pocket of my greatcoat, which for the time being remained empty, empty of stones that is, for its usual contents remained, as well as occasional objects.

			<p>From Molloy's classic post, &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/842641270X/diesekoschmar-20">Now I Begin to Suck</a>&quot;:</p><blockquote><p>I took advantage of being at the seaside to lay in a store of sucking-stones.

All (all!) that was necessary was to put for example, to begin with, six stones in the right pocket of my greatcoat, or supply-pocket, five in the right pocket of my trousers, and five in the left pocket of my trousers, that makes the lot, twice five ten plus six sixteen, and none, for none remained, in the left pocket of my greatcoat, which for the time being remained empty, empty of stones that is, for its usual contents remained, as well as occasional objects. For where do you think I hid my vegetable knife, my silver, my horn and the other things that I have not yet named, perhaps shall never name. Good. Now I can begin to suck. Watch me closely. I take a stone from the right pocket of my greatcoat , suck it, stop sucking it, put it in the left pocket of my greatcoat, the one empty (of stones). I take a second stone from the right pocket of my greatcoat, suck it put it in the left pocket of my greatcoat. And so on until the right pocket of my greatcoat is empty (apart from its usual and casual contents) and the six stones I have just sucked, one after the other, are all in the left pocket of my greatcoat. Pausing then, and concentrating, so as not to make a balls of it, I transfer to the right pocket of my greatcoat, in which there are no stones left, the five stones in the right pocket of my trousers, which I replace by the five stones in the left pocket of my trousers, which I replace by the six stones in the left pocket of my greatcoat. At this stage then the left pocket of my greatcoat is again empty of stones, while the right pocket of my greatcoat is again supplied, and in the right way, that is to say with other stones than those I have just sucked. These other stones I then begin to suck, one after the other, and to transfer as I go along to the left pocket of my greatcoat, being absolutely certain, as far as one can be in an affair of this kind, that I am not sucking the same stones as a moment before, but others. And when the right pocket of my greatcoat is again empty (of stones), and the five I have just sucked are all without exception in the left pocket of my greatcoat, then I proceed to the same redistribution as a moment before, or a similar redistribution, that is to say I transfer to the right pocket of my greatcoat, now again available, the five stones in the right pocket of my trousers, which I replace by the six stones in the left pocket of my trousers, which I replace by the five stones in the left pocket of my greatcoat. And there I am ready to begin again. Do I have to go on?</p></blockquote>

My passion for verbal surnames was inflamed a few years ago, when I taught a student named &quot;Elizabeth Spies.&quot; (You doubt me?) In the age of Google, she is practically invisible, buried beneath the combined noise of her name and its various permutations. As if the Queen of the same name and her elaborate network of spies (I'm looking at you, Franky) weren't enough to foil casual efforts to locate Elizabeth, Google's insistence that someone searching for &quot;Elizabeth Spies&quot; may be interested in &quot;Elizabeth's pies&quot; and its permutations seals the deal. Not that I'm looking for Elizabeth, mind you, or that I want a less visible web presence. I only mention all this because I've spent the day trying to figure out what Edward said. In this database, Edward said quite a bit. In that one, many Edwards have said many things, but none of them are my Edward, so none of them said what I'd remembered my Edward said. Frustrating in the extreme, I tell you. So perhaps not having a verbal surname is a good thing. I could've ended up in the imperative mood, forced to live my life under the strangest of directives: &quot;Stanley, fish!&quot; &quot;Susan, sontag!&quot; &quot;Wolfgang, iser!&quot; *The desire to change my name may be genetic. Upon immigrating to America, my grandmother and great-aunt changed their last name to &quot;Starr.&quot; Hollywood, you know.</span></a></div>

Mitchell defines as the weeding out of error, the elimination of trivial or marginal contentions, and the clarification of fundamental and irreducible differences ... the kind of communication which clarifies exactly what is at stake in any critical conflict. We need more of that, less arguing about first principles and the like. THIS HAS BEEN ANOTHER VERY BORING POST BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE GOOD PEOPLE OF A.B.D. PANIC, WHO REMIND YOU THAT ONLY ONE FIRM'S BEEN UNDERMINING FRIENDSHIPS, RELATIONSHIPS, AND LAST VESTIGES OF SELF-WORTH FOR OVER 70 YEARS. SO THE NEXT TIME YOU NEED SOMEONE TO OFF HIMSELF, REMEMBER A.B.D. PANIC: WE'RE HERE WHEN YOU NEED US (SO LONG AS HE ISN'T).</span></a></div>
