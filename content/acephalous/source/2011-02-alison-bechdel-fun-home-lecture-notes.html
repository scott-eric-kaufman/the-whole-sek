        <meta name="description" content="Alison Bechdel's Fun Home fits neatly into the last third of my &quot;Confessional Narratives&quot; course for all the obvious reasons: it's intensely autobiographical; it's told from an emotional and temporal remove from the events narrated; those events are of indisputable significance to the life of the confessor; etc. In particular, it resembles Craig Thomspon's Blankets and Art Spiegelman's Maus in that its focus is on the narrator's relationship with someone particular; however, unlike Thompson's relationship with God or Spiegelman's with his father, Vladek, Bechdel's interested in a fundamental reconcilation with her closeted father. I'm not claiming that Spiegelman was uninterested in understanding his father better, only that his attempt was doomed to failure because the unknowable horror of the Holocaust made it impossible for him to either share that experience or even understand the gravity of its effects on his father, e.g. these non-consecutive panels from &quot;And Here My Troubles Began&quot;: There is something non-universal about the way in which the Holocaust altered Vladek Spiegelman, and as much as Art attempts to divine the particular from the universal or vice versa, he never succeeds. The nightmare of history is such that his father's story can only ever be that: his father's story. The same doesn't logic doesn't hold for Bechdel's Fun Home, not only because the horrors of discovering you're gay aren't comparable to finding yourself in Aushwitz, but because Bechdel's lament is that her father, Bruce, didn't live long enough to experience life outside the closet. It's no coincidence that Bechdel has &quot;a hallucinogenic memory&quot; of accompanying her closeted father to retreive her mother from the city: The irony of this memory occupying an hallucinogenic space &quot;a few weeks since the Stonewall Riots&quot; in Bechdel's memory should be obvious. I'm not saying she's lying or even misremembering, only that she's making history meaningful in a way that's similar to what Vladek performed on the first-order and Art did on the second. The difference between her performance and Art's is that she's doing so in order to make sense of his life in a way Art could never duplicate. Again, not faulting anyone for anything here, merely acknowledging what Art himself does above: the inability to understand, however tenuously vicariously, someone else's experience will prevent you from ever sympathizing with or being able to offer anything but sympathy to this other person. That's not the case in Fun Home, which is less concerned with communicating the attempt to reach an inreconciable understanding than the act of coming to an understanding you can live with. Put in the starkest possible terms: Art fails to understand Vladek because he can't comprehend the Holocaust, whereas Bechdel tries to understand herself through her father's life and succeeds because the attempt is a thing in itself, e.g. the book's Proustian returns to Proust: Fun Home reifies memory via narrative, but it does so in a way that reminds readers that human beings aren't made of words.

<p>Don&#39;t make me pull out the PET scanners, Vance ... because it&#39;ll only depress me more.  No, in terms of memory formation, retention, and recall, emotions and images far outweigh words in terms of the strength of what&#39;s remembered.  I don&#39;t like that any more than you do.</p>

<p><em>Fun Home is pretty good, but defective I think in a number of ways.</em></p>

<p>Defective how?  I only ask because I&#39;m teaching it again tomorrow and would like a leg up.  Granted, I know the problems I have with it, but they&#39;re all typical of the memoir genre and are mitigated by her references to Proust and Joyce, <em>i.e.</em> by her demonstrating that she knows the limitations of her own memories, etc.</p></span>

<p>It&#39;s been a little while since I read it, so I&#39;m not rememebering &quot;the recourse to the dictionary&quot; distinctly, but if it&#39;s her looking up &quot;lesbian&quot; in the dictionary, that&#39;s a stunningly common element of lesbian coming out stories.  There&#39;s almost certainly a large selection bias in terms of who writes down or publicly shares coming out stories, but it comes up a lot.</p>

<p>The second point seems to me the very definition of memoir.  I would be much more suspect if a writer tried to turn themselves into just one more character amongst the others. It&#39;s also a question of visual focus matching narrative focus: her father is much more closely observed than her mother is, or than any of the other non-her characters for that matter.</p>

<p>The distinction between Bechdel and Spiegelman to me is that Bechdel sets out to tell her own story and her father&#39;s story as a corrolary to her own, whereas Spiegelman sets out to tell his father&#39;s story (and his mother&#39;s by extension), but finds that he&#39;s unable to separate himself and story of his relationship to his father from the effort to understand and present that story.  It&#39;s an order of operations thing, but also a difference in whose memories are being presented how. Bechdel is always clear that it&#39;s her memories, sometimes partly or wholly reconstructed from artifacts, though her memories also include her investigations of other people&#39;s lives and memories. Spiegelman does some of this as well, but the focus is always on his father, and his own life is only introduced as it&#39;s relevant to his efforts to learn and understand his father&#39;s story.</p>

<p>On memory, Scott, you&#39;re using reify wrong, but, like Vance, I also disagree with your characterization of memory.  There&#39;s a large literature on this in a number of different disciplines, but notably in anthropology. People have taken on Hayden White&#39;s contention that narrativity itself is a modern cultural artifice, to argue instead that while the form or content of narrative will vary from culture to cuture, that narrativity itself is universal and therefor likely hardwired. Even if you experience you own memories as emotionally inflected montage, and this is certainly an element of memory for me, I would argue that people genreally think about them narratively.  I would be very surprised if you told me that you think of your memories as flat moments of personal experience, rather than as located at some point within the sweep of your life and therefor related to proximate events in one way and to a set of overarching narratives in another.</p></span>

<p>I agree as to what hooks me, but most of the research indicates that readers like us aren&#39;t the norm.  I&#39;ll pull out sources and such on Wednesday, as this is something I&#39;m obviously invested in.  (Why else read Stein, after all?)</p>

<p>This is an important point, and one I&#39;ll return to shortly, but I&#39;m using reify in the most literal sense: her memories are a series of actual, literal connections in her brain, but more importantly, they&#39;re connections she turns into a book, which is <em>res</em>, a thing, <em>ipso facto</em> etc.  Sorry to be so brief, but must teach tomorrow ...</p></span>

<p>JPool, agreed that memoir is solipsistic practically by definition. In written memoirs, though, the focus can be kept on the author by literary means -- omitting other people, obviously, or writing about them in a way that&#39;s openly slanted, perspectival. There are visual means to such ends as well -- and my point is that Bechdel isn&#39;t using them, or is using them eccentrically, so that my eye kept being drawn to faces that turned out to be slightly dead. The &quot;contact high&quot; image above is a pretty good exception: the bold figure on the right is not a character, but an intensely felt glimpse from a distance. Too many square inches of Bechdel&#39;s frame (I&#39;m claiming) are not alive either in this way or in the different way AB grants herself (as here, goggling).</p></span>

<p>OK, that&#39;s a completely legit if extremely weird use, but one would have to perform a series of interpretive gymnastic routines to get that from what you wrote, ie &quot;Fun Home reifies memory via narrative,[and by &#39;narrative&#39; I mean the physical object that contains the written and visual text through which a particular narrative is expressed] ...&quot; </p>

<p>Aaanyway, Vance has it right here: &quot;Keep clear, though, the distinction between &#39;how memory works&#39; and &#39;the way we think of memory&#39;.&quot;  Memories are encoded in the brain one way, but unless we&#39;re brain damaged (and I suspect Oliver Sacks would have an apropos anecdote here) we don&#39;t leave them like that.  Think about what happens when a memory bubbles up and you can&#39;t place at first where or when in your life it took place. Assuming that you are anything like me, it drives you nuts! It remains an irritant until you can successfully locate it within narrative or manage to forget it again.</p>

<p><i>so that my eye kept being drawn to faces that turned out to be slightly dead.</i></p>

<p>Vance, that&#39;s totally fair. I think part of it is that there&#39;s prespective but no real depth of field in <i>Fun Home</i>, so your eye isn&#39;t directed away from the bits she&#39;s not as invested in. I wouldn&#39;t have identified that as something that bothered me while reading it, but there definitely was something about the composition that chewed a bit.</p></span>

<p><em>Even if you experience you own memories as emotionally inflected montage, and this is certainly an element of memory for me, I would argue that people generally think about them narratively.</em></p>

<p>First, there&#39;s a difference between the way most people think about memory and the way scholars do.  Keep in mind that people commonly refer to &quot;having&quot; memories, <em>i.e.</em> to them being things that can be possessed despite the fact they only exist as unactivated neuronal connections until they&#39;re &quot;had.&quot;  So, they &quot;have&quot; memories, but once they try to communicate them, they do so through narrative.  Obvious enough.  But most of that understanding of our own lives--those narratives we tell ourselves about ourselves to be ourselves, in the Steinian formulation--isn&#39;t tangible in the way Bechdel&#39;s is.  She&#39;s taking the physical pathways in her head and reifying them into a tangible object you and I can hold in her hands.  (Keeping in mind, of course, that this process is endlessly recursive: thinking about having thought about something changes the physical structure of the memory, etc.)  That&#39;s what I meant when I used the word, but I can understand why that wasn&#39;t clear.  In other words, when I say it reifies memory via narrative, I mean it&#39;s only in the act of narration, in creating the object that is <em>Fun Home</em>, I&#39;m pointing to the special status of a graphic novel vs. an ordinary novel when it comes to autobiography. </p>

<p>Vance:</p>

<p><em>the distinction between &quot;how memory works&quot; and &quot;the way we think of memory&quot;.</em></p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve mentioned James Olney&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226628175/diesekoschmar-20" rel="nofollow"><em>Memory &amp; Narrative</em></a> before, but in case not, I will now: it&#39;s an engagingly thorough history about how people have thought about memory, and as you can tell from the title, &quot;narrative&quot; is a crucial component to it; however, it&#39;s not the only component, as even thinking about the Augustine, for whom memory was a &quot;huge repository,&quot; with &quot;secret and unimaginable caverns,&quot; that houses &quot;all these things, to be recalled and brought out for use when needed.&quot;  Narrative entails movement, but the Augustinian notion is as static as they come.</p></span>

<p>This is where you lose me. I don&#39;t really care about &quot;reify&quot; and I suspect with time it will mean something quite different than what it originally did, but I  don&#39;t see how the addition of pictures makes a graphic novel more of an object (or more fixed, or whatever you meant) than a regular old texty book.</p>

<p>This:<br />
<i>there&#39;s a difference between the way most people think about memory and the way scholars do.</i><br />
is obnoxious (duh; which scholars; what aspects of memory; etc), but I won&#39;t belabor the issue.</p>

<p>With Augustine you&#39;re getting into the (English language; I don&#39;t know how it works in Latin) slippage between memory and memories. &quot;Memory&quot;, the faculty, includes all of those things that we (think) we remember: facts, impressions, associations, as well as events or personal experiences. &quot;Memories&quot;, by contrast, is used almost exclusively for personal, episodic recollections.  These are stored and re-stored in the brain as episodes, but we access and make sense of them through narrative.</p></span>

Sally Kern wants to make it clear that her new legislation protecting the rights of science teachers to “teach all science instead of just the Darwin model” is in no way an attempt to introduce creationism or Intelligent Design into the classroom. It is, in fact, just an attempt to let teachers teach “pure science” about “all of evolution” No student in Oklahoma can possibly understand the modern world without a firm grasp of heterogenesis, Lamarkian inheritance, kinetogenesis, orthogenesis, metakinesis, geographic isolation, biologic isolation, the Baldwin effect, organic selection, and orthoplasty, to name but a few. To stick to those strains of evolutionary theory that Morse Peckham called “Darwinisticistic” is a travesty against science and democracy that can only be rectified by the State of Oklahoma commissioning to write a textbook for many moneys.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/02/concerning-those-elections-and-their-consequences.html"><span><strong>Concerning those elections and their consequences</strong> It seems impossible for a conservative to write anything about Wisconsin without noting, for their records, that elections have consequences. The original context of Obama’s statement, you’ll remember, is a conversation he had with Eric Cantor on his third day office. Having been handed a helpful list of deficit-reductions suggestions by the Representative, the newly minted President responded “Elections have consequences, and at the end of the day, I won.” At which point, as you well know, the Republican faithful graciously bowed out of public life and allowed the President to impose his will on the nation, which is why Guantanamo is now closed; the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are now over; single-payer healthcare is the law of the land; and the Caliphate is nearly installed. Because that’s how conservatives are using this phrase: “Union members of Wisconsin,” they say, “Scott Walker was elected, and elections have consequences, so quit bitching and go home. We won, and now we’re going to do whatever we want. You lost the right to complain when you lost.” The problem with their rhetoric is plain to anyone who noticed—which includes all those linked above—that the Tea Party held a counter-protest yesterday, i.e. the Tea Party exists precisely because they didn’t accept the very same logic they’re launching at the protesters. ”Elections have consequences” doesn’t mean, as they’re currently construing it, “Roll over and die.” It means what they thought it meant two years ago, which is that they’re in for a political fight. There is, of course, one more crucial difference: conservatives protested over fictional abuses of authority—czars, death panels, long-form birth certificates, etc.—whereas the protesters in Wisconsin are fighting against the bill as stated both by the person who drafted it and every conservative cheering on the union busting.</span></a></div>
