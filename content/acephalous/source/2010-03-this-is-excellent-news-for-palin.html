Then there’s the fact that, on principle, dreamers this dumb deserve pity: Palin’s playing 11th dimensional chess that RedState’s not seeing, because it’s so focused on Romney, or dazzled by his Mattel-produced hair.

<blockquote><p>We believe the TV show [Sarah Palin]’s producing with

<p>For something written by “<a href="http://hillbuzz.org/2010/03/10/why-sarah-palin-will-win-in-2012/#comment-140616">such good writers</a>,”
that sentence is uglier than it is stupid. The majority of Americans
won’t appreciate a show about “the wonders of Alaska” for the simple
reason that Americans only watch things about Alaska when <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427312/">its bears eat tourists</a>. Don’t believe me? Consider Christopher Nolan’s career:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Batman Begins</em>: $205,343,774<br />
<strong><em>Insomnia</em>: $67,263,182</strong><br />
<em>The Dark Knight</em>: $533,316,061</p></blockquote>
<p>When his films take place in Alaska, their domestic gross drops, on average, <em>very large numbers</em> because Americans don’t believe that states whose moose-caribou population density (<a href="http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF8/833.html">1.11/sq. mi.</a>) outstrips its population density (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska">1.03/sq. mi.</a>)
count as America. The idea that a successful Palin campaign could be
initiated by a show about 700,000 moose and caribou picked to live in a
state and have their lives taped to find out what happens when they
stop being polite and start getting real—there’s wishful thinking, then

<p>Follow that <em>RedState</em> link and you’ll find a discussion of <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/03/10/the-math-behind-a-palin-victory/3/">a post</a> at the <em>Daily Caller</em> that warms my heart:</p>
<blockquote><p>[I]t is very important to point out that something like this may already be Palin’s plan (for the record, <em>I have shared almost all of these thoughts with her via her personal e-mail but have received no response</em>).
So far, I have not seen one shred of legitimate evidence indicating
that she has decided to run and some serious indications that she won’t.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait—Palin decide to ignore <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/how-to-be-an-as.html">this asshole</a>?  Excellent. Anyone with any sense would distance herself from people <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/listen-closely-to-outrage-manufactured-over-an-utterly-innocuous-nea-conference-call-and-you-can-almost-hear-pat-buchanan-re.html">like him</a>, <em>wait</em>—did I just suggest that Sarah Palin is a person with sense?

<p>I don&#39;t think we need to choose, because it will be an utter failure <em>unless</em> Palin is eaten by a bear.</p>

<p>1) Yes, that is creepy, and 2) I don&#39;t know when that got there, but a) I didn&#39;t put it there, and b) it must&#39;ve been recently, because I would&#39;ve i) noticed it and ii) demanded to know why TypePad automatically opted me in to something again.

<p>It&#39;s been years, and I was never a regular watcher, but my recollection is that N.E. was about quirks and adaptations to a fundamentally hostile environment rather than about stupidity, as such. The characters weren&#39;t dumb (mostly), but they were severely limited by the size of the community, the natural environment, complicated by the range of cultural differences common to a frontier. </p></span>

That&#39;s like having a body builder take on Erkel.  Batman has a monthly following of about 85,000 readers, multiple years worth of video games, movies, theatrical serials, and a tv shows.  People already know the potential of fun that can be had with this property (regardless of some bad stuff made here and there), so they easily take a chance.  With &#39;Insomnia&#39; you risk seeing either a really, really crappy movie about a crazy person that you feel wasted your time and money, with a slim, slim chance for something really wonderful.  Plus, Nolan&#39;s Insomnia was a remake of the Norweigan film of same name.  One could say that remakes are never as strong or as good as the original: Japan&#39;s &#39;Shall We Dance&#39; vs. America&#39;s &#39;Shall We Dance&#39;. </p></span>

I don't blog for the swag, but when swag happens, I know who to thank. (That would be you.)** **Because I hate Reynoldsian product-drops in which he masks bragging about the awesomeness of his traffic with a &quot;Heh&quot; and a &quot;Huh.&quot; I don't deny that it's awesome to walk all the way the dumpsters or the complex gym without a service interruption, but I know that I owe my ability to experience that awesomeness to you, and I want to thank you for that.*** ***This post is symptomatic of how uncomfortable I am with having an audience I can't count on my phalanges, i.e. larger than a classroom. You folks frequently make my life far more interesting than it has any right to be, and I want to thank you for that.</span></a></div>

Finished. Kaput. Over. Now, what should I do when I'm in England next month?</strong> So ends another maddening iteration of William Rainey Harper's infernal experiment writ large (except for all the office hours I'll hold next week and however many days it takes me to honestly assess my performance this quarter and grade their final papers equitably), and I'm so exhausted I can't even muster brains enough to translate time zones and purchase tickets to England, where I'll be headed in April to attend this conference. I'll be spending a week in England, and plan on spending time with friends I haven't seen in some time and some I've never met, but what else should I do and see while I'm there? What's essential to the non-tourist experience of London and how much of it can I cram into the four days I won't be attending the conference? (And if you happen to live there and feel like risking hosting a stranger to whom random and terrible things frequently occur, drop me a line.) On a completely unrelated note, there's a new album by the National on the horizon, and I'm giddy as a Jew-child is annoyed on Christmas morning:</span></a></div>
