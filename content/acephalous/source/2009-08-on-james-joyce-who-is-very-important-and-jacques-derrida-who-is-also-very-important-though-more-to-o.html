        <meta name="description" content="As a few people have expressed interest (and because Inside Higher Ed chose to link here on a day in which a picture of Bert and Ernie ogling a young woman has primacy of place), I thought I'd share a bit of the soon-to-be-published essay that will knock the socks off anyone who loves James Joyce or is passionate about newspapers and tramlines. Of particular interest to longtime readers is the deft and not-the-least-bit-overcompensatory inclusion of Derrida halfway through the paragraph, because when I began my graduate career, I could barely write a paragraph without dropping an Important Name; but by its end, I managed to write an entire dissertation without ever mentioning a single theorist. If you think that last bit constitutes evidence of an overcompensation as powerful as the earlier one that drove me to lard every paragraph with one luminary or another, you probably wouldn't be wrong. But enough about that. Here's the excerpt: References to [William Martin] Murphy’s tramlines bookend “Aeolus,” a chapter [in Ulysses] that structurally and thematically criticizes the workings of the Irish press. Although the majority of the chapter occurs in and outside the Freeman’s Journal and not Murphy’s Irish Independent, the coincidence of these two industries is significant. As in “A Painful Case,” a tramcar stoppage is recounted through a narrative structured as a newspaper article: in “A Painful Case” it was an actual article, in “Aeolus” a sequence of headlines. Importantly, the headline that prefaces the first mention of Murphy’s tramlines, and in fact the very first headline, is “IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS” (7.1). Immediately below that headline we learn that “[b]efore Nelson’s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started for Blackrock, Kingstown, and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar, and Terenure, Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines, Ringsend, and Sandymount Tower, Harold’s Cross. The hoarse Dublin United Tramway Company’s timekeeper bawled them off” (7.3-8). In “Devant la Loi,” Derrida claims “that the power and import of the title have an essential rapport with something like the law” (132), that is, that a title has a determinative effect on the “meaning” of the text that follows it. The title cordons the play of signification in the text below it in such a way that, despite its exclusion from the text proper, it becomes an integral part of the text. In another Joycean anticipation of Derridean thought, the relationship of titles to texts is deconstructed in “Aeolus” (if not in the novel as a whole, as the obsession with the Homeric parallels present in each unofficially named chapter demonstrates). The title of this first section, “IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS,” literally cannot contain the text beneath it, which describes the movement of tramcars away from Nelson’s pillar towards the remoter areas of Dublin.

<p>Not only is that a single paragraph, there are still two more sentences to go.&#0160; I would add them, but at that point I start transitioning to a discussion about adulterers, plums, and masturbation and then what would have been the point of bumping down Bert and Ernie?</p>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a55feeb4970c-content"><p>Good point.  I&#39;m claiming that Joyce does what Derrida says there, but I don&#39;t say everything that Derrida says there.  I leave out the part where titles, much like laws, deconstruct themselves, because the narratives they govern always undermine the stable figure of governance, be it a title or a law.  This is the problem with an over-familiarity with theory, I think: you know what follows from what, but neglect to inform your reader of those steps.  (Like I said, this is a very early piece, career-wise for me, and labors under some assumptions I no longer share with myself.)</p></span>

Case in point: I have a La-Z-Boy Pinnacle Recliner that, for reasons of space and decor, had been broken down and forced to live in a storage closet. But now that the wife and I have a spacious new office, it rides again: That disorganized bookshelf juts four feet into the center of the room, so there's a significant division between work-reading and recreational-reading areas—and when I say &quot;significant,&quot; I mean &quot;significant in the sense that distinguishing mental spaces with actual furniture makes it possible to move from one mindset to another by walking across the room.&quot; There is but one problem. Certain sounds are strongly associated with the process of falling asleep. The hum of an air conditioner in an otherwise quiet house or the purring of a cat nestled between my pillow and the wall knock me right out. Now note how wide the chief pillow of my recliner is and how brightly the light shines in through the window in the reading nook. What have I created? I have created the perfect ad hoc cat perch. Which means every time I sit down to read, a cat hops atop my chair and begins purring and I immediately fall asleep. For those who are about to suggest that I simply remove the cat from atop my chair, keep in mind that he has a very short memory. Two minutes later he or one of his cohorts will return and I will fall asleep again. I think this falls under the category of moderate DESIGN FAIL, inasmuch as I now have a napping chair.</span></a></div>
