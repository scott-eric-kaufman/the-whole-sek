		<span id="comment-7893693-content"><p>I&#39;ve often thought of the prolific nature of XIXth century authors (and of Stephen King), to try to understand if there was anything different about the time that would explain their productivity, other than an individual&#39;s talent. The great, dickensian Spanish novelist Benito Perez Galdos, used to get up at 4 in the morning to write for four or five hours. His sister, I think, copy-edited and such. He managed to crank out dozens of voluminous and delightful novels, as well as tons of book-length historical fictions. It boggles the mind. It would be great to read a cultural history of writing, to try to figure out the writing habits of these fellows. But I think that blogging captures something of the XIXth century desire to write and write and write! (as it was done in diaries, journals and letters etc). You, for example, impress me tremendously for the amount that you&#39;ve written that is scholarly on this blog and on The Valve. You&#39;re Jamesian to a degree,  but I mean that as a compliment (because I do not care for James that much; I like the godawful sensualism and brutality of a London -Martin Eden is one of my favorite XIXth century novels-).</p></span>

		<span id="comment-8282783-content"><p>[EDIT: I&#39;ve deleted some nonsense that lived here.]  The fact that the Little Womedievalist to whom I&#39;m married will land the primo job somewhere is all that stands between me and law school.  Last year I took the LSAT and applied to every law school CNN would consider a &quot;reputable&quot; institution and was accepted, with a free ride, to all of them.  If I, as an Americanist, can&#39;t coast into a position on her coat-tails, I know that I&#39;ll take my work ethic, bravado, and dubious distinction as a &quot;master debater&quot; (earned in high school by acquiring 2400 debate points) into law school...and you admire my productivity?  I don&#39;t mean to denigrate your position so much as question my own, and I hope you realize that; but in all honesty, I&#39;m 90% certain that I&#39;ll fail. Some dark mornings I actually consider how I can best sell myself as a <i>disabled</i> deaf Americanist so that I might have some leg up in the market.  (Then I slap my pride around for even considering such a debased tactic.)  </p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;m also a fan of the &quot;up from nothing,&quot; Horatio Alger-esque novel.  But if I admit that, I have to acknowledge the attraction of identity politics, because the majority of the people in my department drive the cars my father--who was a chemical engineer by day and an EMT by night--used to pull the privileged from for the majority of my childhood.  I know I&#39;m not technically, <i>i.e.</i> financially, working class; but I think having a father who was a chemical engineer who would come home after a 13 hour work-day, throw me in the car, take me to a baseball game, serve as third-base coach, then take me to the Randolph Rescue Squad, where I would take a bath in a bucket while he saved the lives of, well, whoever called 911 that night...I think that made me understand what it meant to 1) be socially responsible and 2) work, work, work.  </p>

<p>In other words, this rambling&#39;s introduced you to the <i>locus classicus</i> of my insomnia.  And for that, I apologize.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-8297311-content"><p>Dr. Camicao, I didn&#39;t mean that to be directly a response to you.  That&#39;s called &quot;the 7:40 p.m. panic attack.&quot;  All I meant to say is that I hope to one day be in the position your in.  During the &quot;attack,&quot; I somehow connected my prolixity with your tenure; I&#39;m not entirely sure why.  I do, however, find it strange that the better the quality of my work on a given day, the more likely I am to despair over my job prospects.  </p>

<p>In other words: sorry for sounding so shrill.  I&#39;ll go back and edit some sense into that comment.  </p></span>

Throw cats off bed. Return to sleep. 7:06 Awake to cats wrestling on head. Throw cats off bed. Throw self off bed. Stumble into kitchen. Prepare mug of green tea. 7:15 Grab magazine from pile near chair. Read articles and note which are 1) of general interest and 2) of pedagogical value. 7:55 Shower. Rebel against rinse repeat. 8:00 Greet wife. Eat breakfast while watching Tivo of previous evening's Daily Show. Laugh. Feel powerless to alter the course of history. Laugh again. 8:25 Inform wife it is &quot;time to get to work.&quot; Walk into bedroom/study. Make bed while computer boots. Douse room in lavender-scented Febreze fabric refresher. 8:26 Read email. Answer urgent missives. 8:27 Curse dearth of urgent missives. Question own self-importance. 8:28 Open 192 windows in Mozilla. Read news of Mets' latest late-inning collapse. Observe that 412 strangers read blog while I slept. Begin rebuilding sense of self-importance. 8:35 Decide today will not be the day every newspaper in America will be read. Close 191 windows. Leave &quot;stats&quot; page of blog open in case sense of self-importance flags. 8:36 Time to dissertate! Stare at piles of books. Read through last four or five pages written yesterday. Despair at own stupidity. Stare at piles of books. 9:41 Work up nerve to select books from piles. Choose this one and, um, that one. Open selected books. Attempt to decipher own marginalia. Curse self for poor penmanship. 10:14 Retype final four paragraphs written day before in failed attempt to remind self what self had in mind when self spent 12 hours writing gibberish. Begin to compose this entry. Wonder why &quot;gibberish&quot; spelled with &quot;g&quot; instead of &quot;j&quot; when &quot;jibber-jabber&quot; spelled with &quot;j.&quot; Feel annoyed at trivial turn of mind. Return to retyping final four paragraphs written previous day. 10:37 Finish &quot;the retype.&quot; Understand what was written. Understand what was written to be stupid. Despair! 10:39 Cease hyperventilation. Open new window in Mozilla. Read the Valve. 10:40 Read response to recent article mentioning Y.T. Consider potential post about being known by full name. Think of mother yelling &quot;Scott Eric Kaufman&quot; to alter deviant behavior. Wonder if people who read this entry will be reminded of Ben Marcus. Wonder if readers familiar with work of Ben Marcus. Decide to inform readers that excerpt from The Age of Wire and String available below fold.[1] 10:59 Return to dissertation. Remember general bearings of train-of-thought. Ride the rails. 1:13 Eat lunch. Converse with wife. Commiserate with wife about current conditions in sinuses. Remind wife of recent bout of cancer in order to diminish wife's suffering. Evoke pity from the ill. Feel like horrible person. 1:21 Finish lunch. Apologize for 19,482 time for lording cancer over wife. Acknowledge that past suffering does not diminish...</span></a></div>

Market, Dear Market, How Can We Help You? or We Hate Your Ears!</strong> For reasons I recently mentioned elsewhere, I've had precious little time to develop original material for the blog of late. Such are the spoils of success. Eighty-six that. Replace it with &quot;Such are the 'spoils' of success.&quot; Have to keep my priorities straight. Vis-a-vis the conflagration on the aforementioned elsewhere: I entirely agree with Patrick's statement that he &quot;can understand simultaneously being pleased at the mature level of conversation, while also being disappointed at the lack of bomb throwing.&quot; Like Patrick, I think Pannapacker wanted to see a fair and professional fight, rule-governed but barely so. People wanted, if not the act, then at least the threat that someone would finish the fight with a little less ear than he or she started it with. In that respect, the event was disappointing. The participants remained civil, the essays measured and careful. Both sides landed calculated blows, but only after dancing around the ring. The audience wanted Tyson; we gave them de la Hoya.[1] They felt we had the better whiskers and they groaned everytime we followed a hook with a two-step to the far corner. They wanted ears. &quot;We hate your ears!&quot; they yelled at the Norton they imagined on the ropes. We politely declined to eat ears. We landed a punch and retreated, determined to fight the fair fight. I admit that the fight felt rigged; especially when, in its aftermath, every party claimed marginal status and maximal success. Then it got ugly. CR, with whom I've exchanged emails and whose opinion I respect, called Sean out for calling out the denizens of Long Sunday: This move - to call “us” (Matt/Long Sunday/whomever) out - and then when we fail to answer your claims and queries, accuse us of arrogance (or perhaps incompetence masked by a feigned arrogance...) is bad faith. Here's the thing though: Sean was initially offended—as was I, to be frank—by what seemed like Matt's flip dismissal of his argument. It did seem as if Matt had brushed aside him by saying &quot;I'd argue with you, but I have some really important pasta to boil.&quot; As Matt later acknowledge, the thing about all this is he really did have to leave to cook dinner. Now, through no fault of mine or Sean's, the amount of faith both sides have in the other's intellectual honesty is roughly equivalent to the faith that all sides have that there are WMDs in Iraq or that Karl Rove isn't a savvy political operative but a victim of a vast conspiracy orchestrated by the liberal media.[2] But here's the strange thing: one of the few blogs I check every single days is The Weblog. Why? Because it contains intelligent and informative content—not to mention a regular and refreshing dose of hatred—and the posters don't assume anyone whose surname isn't &quot;of Sorrow&quot; argues in bad faith. That's it. The assumption that people will argue in good faith leads to, well, it leads to people arguing in good faith. The alternative is that...</span></a></div>
