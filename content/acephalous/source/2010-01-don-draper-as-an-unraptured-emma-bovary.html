			<p>As I noted in the comments to <a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/12/it-goes-without-saying-that-no-one.html">this post</a>, it was only a matter of time before I started <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000YABIQ6/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Mad Men</em></a>;
however, as I&#39;ve studiously avoided reading about the show for the
better part of two years now, I&#39;m not sure my insights into it will be
all that insightful. (Still, I&#39;ll soldier on, with the caveat that I&#39;m
about to watch the eighth episode of the most recent season and would
rather not have it spoiled. Not, mind you, that I think it could be, as
the one of the defining features of the show is the thundering

Draper and his fellows at Sterling-Cooper aggressively court their own
obsolescence by cultivating an aesthetic that appeals to inhabitants of
a disappearing culture. In this respect, focusing the show around the
Gatsby in the gray flannel suit is an inspired decision: Draper is a
man at a remove both from his own history and those of archetypes that
shape his character, and as such is constitutionally belated. He does
not believe in free love, like his beatnik paramour Midge Daniels, he
merely lacks a convincing moral objection to committing serial
adultery. His persona is a fashioned response to a vanishing culture,
and it appeals—both for the clients of Sterling-Cooper and viewers of
the show—to the perpetually recycled nostalgia for a time in which
romantic figures of powerful genius were recognized and compensated
accordingly. In the decades previous, as evidenced by <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=11MEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=%22ad%20men%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ad%20men%22&amp;f=false">an article Earnest Havemann wrote for <em>Life</em> in 1958</a>, it had actually been true that</p><blockquote>most
advertising agencies were started on the strength of one man&#39;s genius
and personality. These old giants of the business had an intuitive feel
for advertising. Flying strictly by the seat of their pants, they made
brilliant guesses as to what would put the public in the mood to buy
and planned brilliant campaigns around their hunches. Yesterday&#39;s ad
man used to take a look at the product, then go off in a corner to
dream up his campaign. Today&#39;s ad man sends for the research on what
consumers are thinking about at the moment and often goes out to size
up the consumer himself.</blockquote><p>Havemann captures, in miniature,
why Peter Campbell&#39;s career will inevitably eclipse Draper&#39;s: a person
can only have hunches about cultures they know intimately, so the value
of a Don Draper is inversely proportional to, for example, market
penetration into urban black communities. This is not to say that
Campbell&#39;s attempt to identify the desires of black Americans at the
beginning of the Civil Rights Movement makes him any more sympathetic
as a character, or to viewers, as his commitment to equality is as
instrumental as Draper&#39;s is to free love.</p><p>Campbell is, in a sense, becoming <em>us</em>, and we revile his behavior to the extent that we recognize our sins in his actions. Draper, however, is becoming <em>art</em>,
and as such we hold him as responsible for his actions as we would Emma
Bovary. His self-fashioning was not merely based on literary precedent,
it was an act of literature, if you will, and much of the appeal of the
show is based on watching an inscrutable literary character interact with actual
humans. Not literally, of course, but as the show moves forward in
time, the endgames of everyone <em>except for Draper</em> become
increasingly recognizable to the audience as modern types. We know why
the black elevator attendent is reluctant to talk to the white
advertising accountant. We know why the career woman is undermining
gender expectations by sleeping around. These characters are
commendable or revolting according to a familiar cultural logic
tempered by a little historical knowledge. We may not know precisely
how the story of Peggy Olson ends, for example, but we know what will
limit her ability to grow and how struggling against the stunt will
deform her, because hers is the thundering predictability of unwed
mothers and unfair office politics.</p><p>So Peter and Peggy are not
left behind because, over the course of two seasons, they learn to love
and accept modernity in their hearts. They still seek Draper&#39;s
approval, but they recognize that he&#39;s valuable in a way the world soon
stop valuing. When the rapture comes, they know Draper won&#39;t be
numbered among the chosen. They may not know why—Draper himself seems
ignorant—but they know. The key item, in this regard, is the note left
by the hitchhikers who dose and rob Draper:

</p><p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ZEf6TUYdm_0/S1EoPKzVgzI/AAAAAAAAAC0/Hacedeef3P4/s1600-h/madmen.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427163267020981042" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ZEf6TUYdm_0/S1EoPKzVgzI/AAAAAAAAAC0/Hacedeef3P4/s400/madmen.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 225px;" /></a></p>

<p>In
an act of petty kindness, almost pity, they leave him behind with the
means to join them because they know he lacks the will to do so. They may not
have personally witnessed his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Locust">days of the locust</a>
in the second season, but like Peter and Peggy, they understand that he
will not be following them into the future. Nor, for that matter, will
Joan Holloway, whose related status I&#39;ll address in a future post
should you so desire.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never understood why people take such an anachronistic approach to character (and scenery and props): the old mingles with the new all the time, everywhere. Have you ever seen a parking lot in which all the cars were new? No: there&#39;s older ones, out of date and out of fashion, always mixed in. Same with people: some do &quot;move with the zeitgeist&quot; but most don&#39;t, trapped in their adult patterns (or adolescent ones, depending on their development and the issue). Perhaps I&#39;m more aware of it in academia, where the tenure system blends generations of scholars together rather than allowing a smooth transition from one age to another. </p>

<p>This is why &quot;the sixties&quot; is such a misnomer, as all decadal notations are. There are people there who are precursors to the 70s, people who still live like the 50s never ended, folks who came of age in the 40s and miss the social character (if not the rationing, etc.), etc., etc.</p></span>

<p>I&#39;ll allow that, but not the predictability of the plot. Surely you didn&#39;t see the lawnmower scene coming? (I won&#39;t say any more in case you haven&#39;t got that far yet.)</p></span>

Constructing himself along the lines of a 50s flannel suit means wearing a willful blindness, ok, but you&#39;ve seen season 2, which means you saw him trying on lives like they were clothing, even if only in California: idle jet setter, hot rod mechanic. </p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely right about Peter Campbell being us — which is why, contra Kugelmass, he <i>is</i> contemptible. </p>

<p>But when you see a particular scene in the season 3 finale, I think you may rethink Peggy Olson.</p>

<p>For me (I wanted to write about this at length sometime, but it&#39;s half-baked just now), Don Draper, more than anything, and apart from what he&#39;s made himself to <i>represent</i>, is Borges&#39; Shakespeare in &quot;Everything and Nothing&quot;: &quot;Instinctively, he had already trained himself in the habit of pretending he was someone, so it would not be discovered that he was no one.&quot; </p>

<p>In America, pre-rapture, what this makes him perfect for selling the nylons by inventing love (to gloss the pilot). </p></span>

SEK: Welcome, folks, to my first (and most certainly last) interview with former Vice Presidential-candidate, Sarah Palin. Before we start, Sarah, I want to read what I wrote last night in my journal—I'm only kidding. That wouldn't be professional. How about we start with an easy one? I know how much you love circles, Sarah, so how about you talk in one for me? PALIN: The political system is what creates this disenchantment with the people looking at the political system. SEK: You are a marvel. Now, say something that reveals yourself to be even dumber than your haters think you are about, say, the results of the last election. PALIN: That is not a representative form of government that our country was founded upon. SEK: It certainly isn't. I mean, it can't be. Governments are only representative when they represent the perspective of— PALIN: Common sense conservatives. SEK: With— PALIN: Common sense conservative values. That's why you see pressure from the tea party movement, from others, wanting to—wanting those common sense conservative values back in. SEK: Such as? PALIN: Common sense solutions that sometimes we're made to feel stupid because we believe in these common sense solutions. SEK: Exactly. Do you think things will change? PALIN: I think things are going to change, too. And if you look back in history, you see that it is about—every 200 years, something drastically changes in a society, in a culture, in a governmental system. We're due for that change—just on a historical perspective, it shows us that yes, something is coming. SEK: You really believe that? PALIN: I do believe it, because again, we can't be so stupid as to see these common sense solutions. SEK: Speaking of the future, is it here today? PALIN: Already the change is creating this unrecognizable system that we're a part of. SEK: In the past, could the French see into the future, and if so, how would they feel about the French today? PALIN: Even the French recognized, too, the potential in this free country. And the French gifted the Statue of Liberty to us, in partnership, this international symbol of liberty and freedom—the French hoping that we wouldn't lose that and we won't evolve into something more along their lines. SEK: Precisely. One last thing: can you prove that the copy-editors at Fox are out to get you? PALIN: Well, let me tell you one thing in that vain. SEK: Thank you, Governor Palin, it's been a pleasure. PALIN: And the people are going to decide and I think he is going go and it is time. SEK: Thank you, Governor, the interview's over. You— PALIN: My favorite. That would be great. SEK: Your favorite? Favorite what? Seriously, Madame Governor, you— PALIN: Gems. Gems representing the natural resources in our nation. SEK: Gems? PALIN: Yes. I thought, oh, no, he's going to do a gotcha and that's why I google—I had Track google real...</span></a></div>
