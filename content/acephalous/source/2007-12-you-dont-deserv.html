        <meta name="description" content="(This post began as a response to Sisyphus' latest post, but was eaten by Blogger. Instead of risking repetition, I'm posting it here. I'm not telling anyone anything they don't already know. I just think it's important to remind people what &quot;random&quot; really means.) I know about fifteen people on the market this year, and I'm constantly having to remind them not to personalize their successes and failures. When they fail, they appeal to the randomness of the market and despair—but when they succeed, they believe it a sign of their inherent value. They're now beautiful and unique snowflakes whose true value has been finally been recognized! Never do they stop and think about all the candidates who didn't land that job—you know, the ones who are at home consoling themselves by appealing to the randomness of the market. So I want to say this loud and clear: Those of you who land interviews, campus visits and offer sheets? You are no more deserving of them than anyone else on the market. I know you think you are—I know you're thrilled by the very thought of your own deservedness, but consider the conditions of your &quot;triumph.&quot; You have bested your contemporaries in a game of chance. Put another way: Do some players deserve to win at roulette? Are they inherently better scholars because they do? Of course not. Having been on two hiring committees now, I can tell you that, short of gross incompetence, the odds of you making the final cut depend not on you, but on a host of factors to which you're not privy. They include, but are not limited to: the personal histories of the committee members; internal departmental politics; unadvertised but vital institutional needs; &amp;c. (And &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.) For example, your chapter on Wyndham Lewis might be forthcoming in Modernism/modernity, but if one of the committee members believes Lewis' contributions to Vorticism are overshadowed, aesthetically, by Jessica Dismorr's, and that were it not for the sexist assumptions of early 20th Century art critics (which, by writing on Lewis, you've unthinkingly replicated) Dismorr would be hosanahed and Lewis dustbinned—if someone on the committee believes that, you've no shot at that job. Your merits matter far, far less than their prejudices.* If, however, you happened to write on Dismorr, and this same person is on the committee, you're almost guaranteed a campus visit. This is what I mean when I say you don't deserve the what you land any more than you don't what you don't. If you remove the personal element—if you treat the market like a roulette wheel, you won't believe your losses reflect poorly on you, nor that your victories are deserved. They're not. This will make you a much happier person. That is all. *A purely hypothetical example.

		<span id="comment-92760124-content"><p>Tomemos, I&#39;m not on the market this year, so this has nothing to do with me personally -- hence, no intended and/or personal snottiness.  My point is that for the most part, all the candidates out there have accomplished much the same thing.  Yes, some may be more well published than others ... but we all know that publishing in academia&#39;s more about who you know than how qualified you are. And yes, some people may have attended a more prestigious institution, or won a more prestigious post-doc than others ... but we all know that where you go to grad school and what post-docs you win have more to do with who you know than how qualified you are.  Look, I say this as someone who&#39;s been the beneficiary of this nominally meritocratic system: I shouldn&#39;t be here in the first place, and I recognize that.  I lucked into the status I&#39;ve &quot;earned,&quot; and I&#39;m not going to tell absolutely qualified, brilliant people that they&#39;re not getting jobs because their CV&#39;s inherently flawed.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had enough of praising the lucky for the luck.  There&#39;s no method to the madness of the market, and once we accept that, we&#39;ll all be much happier.  If we strike out our first time up, well, it&#39;s not because we 1) don&#39;t belong in academia, 2) never belonged in academia or 3) faked our way through academia ... it&#39;s because our stars didn&#39;t align.  We didn&#39;t have the right committee overseeing these job searches.  It&#39;s because we mistakenly tried to tackle some fashionable author when this committee wanted a traditionalist ... or that we took a traditionalist approach when this committee wanted the latest-and-greatest.  </p>

<p>Really, I&#39;m not telling people not to proud of their &quot;accomplishments&quot; ... I&#39;m merely saying that what they accomplished was the successful completion of their Ph.D.  As someone who paid his filing fee this morning and will earn his doctorate come Winter&#39;s end, I&#39;m in total agreement with you.  I busted my ass for this degree, and I&#39;m damn proud of it. </p>

<p>BUT!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it entitles me to a job when the market&#39;s as random as it is.  I certainly think I do good work.  I&#39;m certainly proud of my accomplishments ... but that doesn&#39;t mean I deserve a job, and I think it&#39;s healthier for <em>everyone</em>, those who land jobs an those who don&#39;t, to depersonalize the process, to recognize that their &quot;qualifications&quot; for a certain position are as random as the stars aligning this or that way.</p>

<p>So yes, this post should annoy you -- not because you&#39;re you, because, as you well know, I like you -- but because the system to which we entrust our future is as reliable as a roulette wheel.  Don&#39;t believe me?  How about <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2007/12/07/the-russian-kind/" rel="nofollow">Eric Rauchway</a>?  [<em>Edited so as to not be such a brat.</em>]  Granted, I wrote this not to annoy, but to deflate those who hit <b>LUCKY RED LUCKY RED LUCKY RED</b> and then think they deserve their &quot;victory&quot; ... because they had enough cash to enter a bid.  Thing is, we all have enough green to step to the table, but that doesn&#39;t mean the winner&#39;s any more deserving than the losers.  That&#39;s my point.</p>

<p>Not sure how that&#39;s snotty ... unless I&#39;ve mixed my anti-snottiness with some confidence, which means the dilithium crystals are fixing to bust ...</p></span>

		<span id="comment-92763196-content"><p>Scott, your argument makes some sense in terms of a particular university&#39;s choice between the three candidates who make it to a campus visit.  But in terms of the overall job search I don&#39;t think it works.  The idea that the job market is entirely random is just as debilitating as the idea that it is a perfectly accurate reflection of your talents and accomplishments.  While there&#39;s nothing you can do to guarantee that you will get a job, there are many things you can do to improve your chances - i.e., peer-refereed publications (which most definitely do not depend on who you know), having your dissertation in hand when you apply, the quality of your letter, your level of preparation for interviews, etc.  Getting interviews is a sign that people out there think that you&#39;re a reasonable candidate.  Getting no interviews is definitely not a sign that you&#39;re a bad scholar.  But it is a sign that you need to beef up your qualifications before hitting the job market next year.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-92764428-content"><p>I was mostly with you, Scott, but I&#39;m going to have to take exception to this comment on a couple of grounds. (with the caveat that we may be talking past each other entirely, since I&#39;m looking at the field of history, especially Asian history, and you&#39;re looking at the field of American literature) </p>

<p>First, a lot of the people who get &quot;lucky&quot; in this business do so because they do more than the minimum, and show the committees that they have the potential to grow into the jobs (the requirements of which often have little to do with the skills we&#39;ve acquired in attaining our &quot;accomplishments&quot;). There <i>are</i> differences in quality between candidates -- I&#39;ve been in on a half dozen or more searches, some of which had over a hundred candidates, in both history and writing/rhetoric -- some of which are under the control of the candidates themselves.</p>

<p>Second, I&#39;ve never gotten anywhere because of &quot;who I know,&quot; unless the person recommending me knew that I was good at what I was proposing to do -- my recommenders and contacts know plenty of smart and productive people, and have no reason to say anything nice about me if it isn&#39;t true -- and I could actually produce what I said I would. My publications weren&#39;t referreed by friends (boy, you can say that again); my national meeting panel proposals weren&#39;t accepted by friends; none of the people who&#39;ve offered me jobs are &quot;friends of friends&quot; (unless they&#39;re keeping it secret). </p>

<p>I understand that you&#39;re trying to be comforting to people who deserve comfort: there <i>are</i> more qualified applicants than jobs in most fields these days, and job ads never really tell you the whole story about what factors are going to go into selecting short lists. That does <i>not</i> mean that the people who get interviews don&#39;t deserve them, just that they don&#39;t necessarily deserve them more than <i>some</i> of the people who didn&#39;t get them; similarly for every stage in the process. There is always slippage, error, cronyism, system-gaming, brown-nosing. But to tar everyone with that brush is simple sour grapes.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-92767596-content"><p>&quot;Tomemos, I&#39;m not on the market this year, so this has nothing to do with me personally…&quot;</p>

<p>I know that.  My assessment stands.  Telling people who have just achieved success (in any field, not just the academy) that their accomplishments are no no better than anyone else&#39;s, that they lucked into their success, is snotty.  Stating that new hires have nothing to be proud of aside from their Ph.D.s  (you must know that some dissertations are better than others) is a petty thing to say to people who have worked hard for success and finally achieved it.  Even the way you put it is snide: putting &quot;triumph&quot; in quotes, implying that the successful are conceited (&quot;I know you&#39;re thrilled by the very thought of your own deservedness&quot;).  I took some time away from the keyboard, I came back, I looked at it again, and I felt the same way.  It&#39;s simply an obnoxious way of making a point that isn&#39;t correct anyway.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m not going to tell absolutely qualified, brilliant people that they&#39;re not getting jobs because their CV&#39;s inherently flawed.&quot;</p>

<p>Come on, Scott; that is such a straw man that it makes me wonder why we&#39;re having this conversation.  We are not talking about the people who didn&#39;t get jobs, we&#39;re talking about those who did.  It&#39;s obvious (but still worth saying, especially in this individual case) that there are not nearly enough jobs for all qualified people, and so it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean anything if you didn&#39;t get any responses. It&#39;s perfectly fine to remind the lucky ones (and yes, they are partly lucky) that there are other people who could have gotten there instead; nothing wrong with a little humility.  What you&#39;re doing here is stating that merit simply makes no difference, which is hyperbolic, irrational and, as another commenter said, sour grapes (even if it&#39;s on someone else&#39;s behalf).  I don&#39;t like &quot;the system&quot; either, but it makes no sense to distort the truth of it and denigrate those who have succeeded just to make someone feel better.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-92782910-content"><p>People are going to have a difficult time believing that merit doesn&#39;t enter into the process.  First, I would guess that anyone who&#39;s observed people doing skilled jobs has probably observed that there is a wide range of ability among qualified workers in those jobs.  If that&#39;s so in academia, then the hiring process has to be completely blind to it to be random.  Each individual interaction with the hiring process could be almost entirely determined by random factors (or those not dependent on the applicant, actually), but with enough trials, differences in ability should become apparent.</p>

<p>So people don&#39;t like attempts to cheer them up in this way.  I suggest that instead you give maximally evil advice, and let everyone be cheered up by getting mad at you.   Something like:</p>

<p>If you apply for many jobs and don&#39;t get one, you suck.  Do something else.  If you get a job and believe you deserve it, you&#39;re a jerk and will go far, until that inevitable moment later on when you realize that you&#39;ve been a jerk your entire life.  If you get a job and don&#39;t believe you deserve it, you&#39;re a sad sack and you might as well quit now before you hang on by the skin of your teeth for years and then inevitably self-sabotage yourself.  The only way to avoid these three possibilities is through unremitting apathy, which of course will not get you a job, but which will let you feel virtuous as you sleep in your parents&#39; basement.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-92783836-content"><p>I don&#39;t mind being denigrated if that&#39;s indeed what&#39;s happening. I&#39;m looking out from within the first semester of a new TT job, and a PhD that I received about 6 weeks ago, and I know that I&#39;m here in part because of who I know (it&#39;s unlikely I would have advanced from my MA at WWU to my PhD at Columbia without careful networking in my WWU department), I know that at least one of my forthcoming pubs is due to talking to the right people, and I know that what I attention I&#39;ve received is in part because I deliberately chose a diss topic on a hot new subfield. These are the elements that aren&#39;t chance. Certainly if I stress chance too much I&#39;m engaging in a bit of impostor syndrome, and certainly I can&#39;t disentangle perfectly the relationship between chance and merit (knowing to seize opportunity by the forelock and all that), but with all that firmly in mind, I also know that chance matters a great deal in my getting the job I have (and in not getting the other jobs I didn&#39;t get (being a goldang fool and being simply unqualified at times also plays a role there)).</p>

<p>For instance: after determining who would be interviewing me at Brooklyn College, I looked everyone up. I learned that the medievalist, my now colleague and friend Nicola Masciandaro, is a big metalhead. I&#39;m a fan of metal, too (among other things), so I made a point of working <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt_Thrower" rel="nofollow">Bolt Thrower</a> into conversation at one point. This might have sealed the deal. Who knows?</p>

<p>I&#39;m remembering, by the way, what Scott wrote when <a href="http://jjcohen.blogspot.com/2007/04/since-karl-finally-announced-it-below.html" rel="nofollow">it was announced</a> on my blog purlieu that I got a job:<br />
Karl Steel  said...</p>

<p>    and I should say vis-a-vis &quot;deserving&quot;: no more than others. I&#39;m happy to be where I am, but I&#39;ve no illusions about having won the position through my superior, haha, medieval skills. It saddens me to have won because the market wrecks so many equally (at least!) deserving scholars. More luck to them!<br />
    5:58 PM   <br />
Scott Eric Kaufman said...</p>

<p>    Bah, revel in the deservedness now, fret about the others later. The whole process is a crap shoot, yes -- a friend of mine with three major publications (American Literature, Modern Fiction Studies, PMLA), excellent evaluations, and who just so happens to be a charming individual got eight interviews but no bites -- but the thing of it is, it&#39;s not as if the people who got the jobs he interviewed for aren&#39;t deserving. Pity not the (present and, in my own case, likely future) wanderers, as they&#39;ll land somewhere someday; instead, revel in the fact that you had capital enough to step to the table, and that you earned yourself a job.<br />
....<br />
Karl Steel  said...</p>

<p><br />
    SEK: I also had 8 MLA interviews, only one call back, which (to borrow a metaphor from ALK) came up stillborn. Then the Brooklyn job announcement popped up in Jan and the job itself more or less sprang itself on me during a few weeks of grimness. If I needed a reminder of the randomness of this process, that was it.</p>

<p>    <i>Pity not the...wanderers, as they&#39;ll land somewhere someday</i></p>

<p>    Not pity. I&#39;m just worried about them. CU had 3 medievalists go out this year, and the best one, so far as I&#39;m concerned, didn&#39;t get a job. Bizarre. But good lord: a PMLA article + 2 more isn&#39;t enough? It&#39;s just so distressing. And the certainty that quality will win out: sounds a bit libertarian to me, or, at least, sounds like a sensible world, and I don&#39;t truck with any such system.</p>

		<span id="comment-92791652-content"><p>I&#39;ve had several articles make it through peer review, and I&#39;m not a great networker.  Indeed, even if I were, the copy of the paper that they send to the reviewer <i>doesn&#39;t have my name or institutional affiliation on it</i>.  </p>

<p>And lest we think that the journal editors &quot;know who I am,&quot; it is almost uniformly the case that they address me as &quot;Dr. Kotsko&quot; in correspondance -- a key indicator that they are not fully apprised of my status, which makes sense given that <i>they don&#39;t require you to send in a CV</i>.  </p>

<p>Also, at the one journal where I do know the editors, <i>I&#39;ve had stuff turned down</i>.</p>

<p>The statistical chance of my publishing multiple articles in the absolutely corrupt system you describe is approximately zero.  Hence I conclude that perhaps the system you describe doesn&#39;t exist.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-92795888-content"><p>To say the system is human is not the same thing as saying the system is absolutely corrupt.  I think it was a mistake to lump publishing in the same category with the job market, for the simple reason that journals vary widely in their acceptance policies.  Lots of highly respected journals don&#39;t have blind submission which means, indeed, that who you are and where you&#39;re from can matter a great deal.  </p>

<p>By definition, however, the search process is precisely about these particulars that some journals bracket.  And, again by definition, this means that searches are flawed and human and arbitrary.  I think it&#39;s useful to remind both the distraught and the triumphant that this is the case.  Perhaps you need to be excellent to get on the playing field, to move from a single interview to a dozen, but after that, who knows?  For what it&#39;s worth, I think the only way to get through it all is with kindness, but then again I didn&#39;t get the job everyone thought I was *supposed* to get.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-92809434-content"><p>I should begin at the end, with JPool&#39;s comment:</p>

<p><em>Everyone I know who&#39;s landed a job, or for that matter an on-campus interview their first time out, has been exceedingly humble about their accomplishments, no matter how power-of-positive-thinking they&#39;ve been about the job search up to then.</em></p>

<p>This response was only partly to Sisyphus -- it&#39;s also the result of weeks of annoyance with people on a particular listserv who have been announcing their interviews as they get them, keeping a tally of them in their autosigs, &amp;c.  These aren&#39;t genuinely bad people; they&#39;re desperate, insecure people misplacing their enthusiasm and making other desperate, insecure people feel even more desperate and insecure.</p>

<p>Aaron:</p>

<p><em>Saying that we don’t have the ability to really control whether we get call backs, because there are simply too many factors to track, is not the same thing as assuming the result is really random (if we could know all the data, like the metal-preference example, then we might actually be able to control the result).</em></p>

<p>Beautifully put, and absolutely correct.  The process is overdetermined, not underdetermined.  From the ground, the situations seem the same.  This is why the idea that&#39;s cropped up a few times -- that while you can&#39;t control your chances, you can increase the odds of a good roll -- deserves more attention than I paid it.  Yes, the more publications you have, and the better the venue, the more likely you are to land an interview.  Goes without saying.  But then there are all the stories you hear about the person with no publications who landed a sweet job through what seems to be a random alignment of the stars -- something certainly happened behind the scenes, but we can&#39;t be sure what it was, and we certainly shouldn&#39;t attempt and/or think we can replicate it.  </p>

<p>(I&#39;ll note here that a few of the big blogger academics have admitted as much, <em>i.e.</em> that they were shocked that they landed one interview, that it went poorly, that they were brought for a campus visit and, againt all odds, won the position they shouldn&#39;t have even been in the running for.)</p>

<p>This (not the parenthetical part, but the previous paragraph) speaks to Jonathan&#39;s point above:</p>

<p><em>a lot of the people who get &quot;lucky&quot; in this business do so because they do more than the minimum, and show the committees that they have the potential to grow into the jobs</em></p>

<p>I wholeheartedly agree: to the extent that you control anything, you make your own luck.  The thing is, there&#39;s quite a bit of luck out there being made -- nay, being mass-produced by the hundreds of people vying for those fifteen TT jobs.  Even if you limit the pool of qualified applicants to those who&#39;ve made their own luck, you still leave a lot of talented, hard-working people in the cold.</p>

<p><em>I&#39;ve never gotten anywhere because of &quot;who I know,&quot; unless the person recommending me knew that I was good at what I was proposing to do -- my recommenders and contacts know plenty of smart and productive people, and have no reason to say anything nice about me if it isn&#39;t true -- and I could actually produce what I said I would.</em></p>

<p>Certainly, certainly true -- your connections come with the luck you make.  But the cultivation of those connections -- the production of the work they said you could produce -- doesn&#39;t mitigate the fact that you still have them.  Another way of putting it: earning your way into Harvard still puts you at Harvard, and as Karl&#39;s admitted concerning his time at Columbia, connections worked to put him into that particular Ivy network.  He earned his luck too -- though where he found the music tastes of his potential colleague intrigues me -- but being at Columbia in the first place, having that particular back-channel, not to mention that imprimatur, helped grease the wheel of chance.  </p>

<p>And before anyone asks, I&#39;m not denigrating those who have or earned connections.  It took connections to get me into UCI -- Pat McGee&#39;s behind-the-scenes aid was invaluable -- and I&#39;ll be leaving with some nice connections, some of which I&#39;ve earned through merit, others through blogging.  </p>

<p>Adam and Hylonome:</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, I shouldn&#39;t have lumped publication in with job market stuff.  The two obviously aren&#39;t unrelated (inasmuch as one undergirds the other), but the process of acceptance isn&#39;t comparable.</p>

<p>Rich:</p>

<p><em>People are going to have a difficult time believing that merit doesn&#39;t enter into the process.</em></p>

<p>It certainly does, but not nearly so much as people think.  We can all rattle off a list of candidates who would, were merit a serious deciding factor, have 20 interviews and have to choose between available jobs.  (The first person on my list is up there <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/you-dont-deserv.html#comment-92763196" rel="nofollow">disagreeing with me</a>.)</p></span>

<p>maybe i&#39;m not as connected as you are, maybe many are not, but these things don&#39;t seem to come into play in my world all that much.  and by my world, i include quite a number of people without ivy degrees, mostly public university degrees and jobs.  </p>

<p>i appreciate the gesture in pointing out the many conditions of hiring/interview committees invisible to those not sitting on them; i&#39;m just not sure blaming the lucky is prodcutive or even accurate.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-92813214-content"><p>It&#39;s the absolutism that make this fall apart, Scott.  You didn&#39;t say that applications are largely about luck--which would be hard to dispute--but rather than it&#39;s wholly a matter of luck: &quot;a game of chance,&quot; &quot;roulette.&quot;  (At first I thought you might be hyperbolizing, but you repeated the roulette reference in comments.)

<p>Of course, just because what I&#39;ve just described is unpleasant to contemplate, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not true.  But an extreme claim like that requires pretty strong evidence.  The people I know who have gotten jobs (admittedly, a small sample) have generally been among the hardest-working grads I&#39;ve known, the ones who I strongly suspected would succeed.  For the most part, the inverse isn&#39;t true of those who haven&#39;t yet gotten jobs, but again, that&#39;s different from what you said, which is that those who <i>have</i> gotten jobs aren&#39;t at all distinguished from <i>any</i> of their fellow applicants.</p></span>

<p><em>i guess my only question is why undermine those people who by some miracle squeak through? </em></p>

<p>I&#39;m not undermining them so much as reminding them of the equally qualified candidates who weren&#39;t as lucky.  (I mean, I don&#39;t think Karl felt like I attacked him, nor should he.)</p>

<p><em>it does seem strange to feed the collective neuroses by suggesting that a) your accomplishments matter little; b) cronyism is more responsible than not; c) any decent intellectual would feel awful for having a job when so many do not.</em></p>

<p>The impression I&#39;ve gotten from people who&#39;ve landed jobs is that all of this stuff is visible from the other side.  It&#39;s not cronyism <em>per se</em>, but I know that emails of support for a particular candidate are launched through back-channels, and I know those emails significantly alter the market.  Obviously, you want to produce the strongest work possible, but the strength of your work only matters if it&#39;s read closely and carefully, and if a committee member&#39;s predisposed to read it charitably, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Tomemos:</p>

<p><em>You didn&#39;t say that applications are largely about luck--which would be hard to dispute--but rather than it&#39;s wholly a matter of luck: &quot;a game of chance,&quot; &quot;roulette.&quot; (At first I thought you might be hyperbolizing, but you repeated the roulette reference in comments.)</em></p>

<p>And then I revoked it after Adam&#39;s comment: it&#39;s not random, it&#39;s overdetermined in unknowable ways.  </p>

<p><em>Actually perfecting your academic work would make no difference in getting an academic job.</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it makes <em>no</em> difference, only that it might not make as much of a difference as we like to think.  Many factors intrude here -- from the fact that our published material might not represent our best work, or may have edited poorly by the journal post-acceptance, &amp;c. -- but I don&#39;t think you can say that the person with the best dissertation gets the best job.  Strength of work is but another unknowable factor in our fate -- and this assumes that there&#39;s some sort of consensus for what qualifies as &quot;strong work.&quot;  A Lacanian would find my work weak, inasmuch as I don&#39;t mention Lacan or venture readings under the aegis of Lacanian thought.  I can easily imagine a situation in which two psychoanalytic-inclined/historicists/&amp;c. critics end up on a search committee.  With such variable definitions of strength, there&#39;s room for impressive confusion as to what constitutes quality.  </p>

<p><em>If this were really true, then people would be wasting their time trying to improve their dissertations; they should instead be writing cover letters, applying to as many places as possible because statistically they&#39;ll make it eventually. Or they should be out schmoozing: the more contacts they make, the better the odds that one will come through for them on the market.</em></p>

<p>Rauchway&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2007/12/03/do-thy-homework/" rel="nofollow">Do Thy Homework</a>&quot; post addresses this wonderfully: yes, you should be endlessly revising your cover letter; yes, you should familiarize yourself with the members of the department you&#39;re applying to so that you might better schmooze during the interview; &amp;c.  All of these things are essential to getting a job, and none of them has anything to do with the quality of your work.  (Although your ability to research what you need to know to properly schmooze certainly indicates something about your commitment, scholarly and otherwise.)</p>

<p>All of which is only to say: yes, I obviously pushed the counter-intuitive position as hard as I possibly could.  I did so on purpose, but not merely for rhetorical effect: I sincerely believe that the quality of your work doesn&#39;t correlate with your success/failure on the job market.  I&#39;ve seen too many truly talented people turn adjuncts, and too many marginal talents land jobs their first time out.  I don&#39;t begrudge them -- I fall on the hard-worker/marginal-talent side of the spectrum -- but it&#39;s important to remember that factors beyond your control are equally responsible for &quot;your&quot; success on the market.  You do what you can to stack the deck, but in the end, you don&#39;t know the house rules, or even what game you&#39;re playing ...</p></span>

I can't wear battery-powered watches. Slap one on my wrist and within two hours, it ticks no more. Why? I've ventured all plausible combinations of search terms, but all I've learned is that 1) there are better pedometers out there and 2) my chakras misassimilate life force energies. Neither answer satisfies. I mention this tonight because everything electronic I touched today stopped working. First, my laptop died. Then all my remotes. Now my digital music player. (I'm not wearing gloves now.) (Unless I am.) (Which I'm not.) I don't want anyone to get the impression I think I'm Johnny Bukowski, but I don't think this is a coincidence. There must be some reason this all happened today, right? And it must be related to my power to stop watches, right? Chad? Shelley? PZ? Anyone?</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/i-wont-deserve.html"><span><strong>Why I Won't Deserve the Job I Land</strong> I exercised the better part of my free thought this weekend on how I could've written Friday's post more forcefully. Like others, I'm happy with the conversation it inspired—but the inspirational object had some real problems. (It annoyed Tomemos, a dubious achievement given how fair-minded and even-keeled he is.) So here's a more concrete example of the undeservedness of which I wrote: Imagine a job advertised as follows: Medium-sized state school seeks specialist in 19th Century American literature with an emphasis on post-Civil War authors. Candidate should be able to teach interdisciplinary American Studies courses in tandem with members of the History department. An emphasis on minoritarian literatures is welcome but not required. (I know that doesn't read like an actual advertisement, but I'm running a thought experiment here: verisimilitude's not required.) I apply for this job and am frank about my qualifications: I can teach late 19th Century American literature; as an historicist, I know how American culture is understood and taught in American Studies, History and—because of my dissertation's emphasis on evolutionary theory—History of Science departments; I possess considerable expertise in African-American literature of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, but know little about the period's other minoritarian literatures. The hiring committee reads my honest assessment of strengths and weaknesses and requests an interview. On the phone, they inform me that I'm not exactly what they're looking for, but that there are eight other equally quasi-qualified candidates, so I have a shot at landing the position. (For the moment, pretend that we're all unpublished and have comparably strong dissertations.) During my interview at the MLA, one of the interviewers notices that I helped design the curriculum for the Literary Journalism department. He asks what my exact role was, and I answer him honestly: I helped refine and finalize the syllabi for the two introductory courses; I co-designed the upper-division course on the Ethics &amp; Evolution of Literary Journalism; &amp;c. Over the next fifteen minutes, it becomes clear to them that I could design and manage the undergraduate program in creative nonfiction they've been trying to establish, and before the interview concludes, they offer me the position, complete with pre-approved tenure and a 1-1 teaching load. (Shut it! This is my thought experiment.) Were this to happen, would I deserve the position advertised? I'm as quasi-qualified as the other applicants, but none of them could've known that this department intended on starting a creative nonfiction program. I would've lucked into the position, then, because I'd be no more quasi-qualified than any of my competitors. I merely would've filled a void no one who applied knew needed filling. Obviously, I'm not saying I haven't worked hard—I mean, I slacked a bit during chemo and while rehabbing, but I did keep teaching (although the dissertation ground to a painful halt)—but given the circumstances above, I can't claim I deserve the job in any meaningful sense. I'm no more qualified for the job as advertised than my competition, therefore I don't...</span></a></div>
