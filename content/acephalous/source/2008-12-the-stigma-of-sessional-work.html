		<span id="comment-141324718-content"><p>I just spotted <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/12/03/kentucky" rel="nofollow">this in IHE</a>: <br />
<blockquote>‚ÄúI cannot imagine a teacher taking the risk of working in a rural neighborhood community college without having tenure,‚Äù Alexander said. ‚ÄúWorking in a community college is a kiss of death for an academic who has a desire to work at a research university or even a four-year doctoral granting institution. You don‚Äôt move up once you get down in the community college level. What‚Äôs the motivation for someone moving into a non-tenure track position, unless there just aren‚Äôt any other jobs available? The quality of faculty will go down.‚Äù</blockquote><br />
<p>I disagree, and, ironically, the elimination of tenure at the CC level may well make it <i>more</i> acceptable to shoot for &quot;better&quot; four-year jobs: if there&#39;s no tenure at the CC, then there&#39;s no increased risk to leaving for a tenure-track position elsewhere; no reason to be complacent or get settled. Of course, I don&#39;t really believe that tenure is the attraction this guy claims it is for CC teachers, though it may well be that they need to offer higher pay to attract serious candidates under a non-tenure system.<br />
<p>Getting back to the original point of the post, though, I also disagree about the mobility issue. On search committees I&#39;ve been on, a candidate with the experience of full-time teaching -- CC or 4-year -- has a significant advantage over those who just look smart on paper. The assumption that they&#39;ve been &quot;initiated&quot; or &quot;broken in&quot; or &quot;become experienced&quot; or at least gotten some basic syllabi and course organization skills down is a surprisingly strong component in the decisions I&#39;ve seen. <br />
<p>It&#39;s true that after a few years it becomes more problematic, though someone who&#39;s held down a steady job (as opposed to institution hopping) and kept their scholarship active wouldn&#39;t, I don&#39;t think, be disadvantaged. <br />
<p>I think most of the older faculty you&#39;re worried about, Scott, have moved on to bigger and better things -- retirement -- and the oldest faculty now would have lived through the job drought of the 80s. It&#39;s different at more prestigious schools, perhaps, but that&#39;s not where most of the jobs are, long-term. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-142920446-content"><p>I started off in the lowest of academic slums, an academic slum so bad that community college faculty lock their car doors when driving through the area and clutch their purses a bit tighter when they see us at conferences.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right, I taught at a for-profit vocational school.</p>

<p>I&#39;m now tenure-track at a good university, I have grants and papers and visiting appointments and all that, and I&#39;m doing all the things one must do to claw one&#39;s way up the academic ladder.  My teaching experience was considered an asset in my tt search.</p>

<p>OK, it probably helped that I did this for extra cash while in grad school, and after grad school I did the traditional (for my field, anyway) postdoc with a bit of adjuncting on the side, with all of those experiences at places with Proper Pedigree Names.  So my pedigree is still quite pure.  Still, I slummed it, I enjoyed it (I actually preferred it to my TA experiences at Big Name U), I put that experience high on the CV, during interviews I talked about how much fun I had working with my students at the career school, and I got a tt job.  So it can be done.</p></span>

In the first months of the Presidential race, the politics of Peanuts were as inscrutable as ever: The political positions of the birds‚Äîone of whom Schulz would christen ‚ÄúWoodstock‚Äù two years later‚Äîare literally cryptic. (Snoopy later embraced of identity politics via a nifty collapse of signifier into signified, but let‚Äôs not lit-crit these panels quite yet.) For Schulz, the campaigns of Richard Nixon, Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace were less important than baseball: This dead-pan surrealism here is Peanuts at its artistic best, but at a time when America was at war and a segregationist was a viable Presidential candidate, dead-pan surrealism wasn‚Äôt the order of the day. So Schulz sent Charlie Brown to the beach: This strip‚Äôs a fairly typical example of Charlie Brown‚Äôs half-hearted exasperation with an unfair world. The next? Not only does the world cease its relentless, playful torment of Charlie Brown, but the boy who tamps it down is black and can swim. Because on 31 July 1968, Schulz introduced the world to Franklin. May not seem like much, but it‚Äôs as explicitly political as Peanuts ever ventures. Until, that is, 1 August 1968: The father of Franklin, the black boy who swims, is over in Vietnam. That second panel neatly illustrates how far Schulz strayed from his comfort zone. Charlie Brown‚Äôs father ‚Äúwas in a war, but [he doesn't] know which one.‚Äù That‚Äôs the extent to which contemporary politics typically intruded the most popular daily comic in America. But for some reason, Schulz felt the need to contradict conventional racist wisdom that summer. The racists responded in the manner befitting Wallace-backers: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind you having a black character, but please don‚Äôt show them in school together.‚Äù It must‚Äôve sucked to be a racist. Unless, that is, you‚Äôre a fan of Dennis the Menace: That‚Äôs from 13 May 1970, two years after Schulz quietly integrated public schools. There‚Äôs much to admire in the matter-of-factness of Schulz‚Äôs racial politics. Not only is there no meta- to it, there‚Äôs no mention of it‚ÄîFranklin arrives, befriends Peppermint Patty, and plays football. (x-posted.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/12/now-as-then-the-same-intractable-questions-were-avoided-and-in-the-end-successfully-evaded.html"><span><strong>Now as then, the same intractable questions were avoided and in the end successfully evaded.</strong> So wrote Joan Didion‚Äîborn on this day in 1934‚Äîon the eve of this year‚Äôs Presidential election. Not that she found this evasion particularly shocking: ‚ÄúThis was not an unpredictable occurence,‚Äù she wrote in 1998‚Äôs ‚ÄúClinton Agonistes.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese were not entirely unpredictable developments,‚Äù she writes in this month‚Äôs New York Review of Books. The baseness of American politics may never surprise her, but the stupidity of the American electorate rarely fails to. The object of her pithy restatements of talking points is never the political actor who mouths them (from whom nothing more nor better can be expected). In these moments, the indictment is always of the public too stupid to recognize the absurdity of issues: We heard repeatedly about ‚Äúour children,‚Äù or ‚Äúour kids,‚Äù who were, as presented, avid consumers of the Nightly News in whose presence sex had never been mentioned and discussions of the presidency were routine. (Political Fictions 233) We could argue over whether or not the McCain campaign had sufficiently vetted its candidate for vice-president, but take at face value the campaign‚Äôs description of that vetting as ‚Äúan exhaustive process‚Äù including a ‚Äúseventy-question survey.‚Äù (‚ÄùA Fateful Election‚Äú) She does recognize the complicity of the press in this‚Äîwhat with its ‚Äúarresting enthusiasm for overlooking the contradictions inherent in reporting that which only occurs in order to be reported‚Äù (Political Fictions 30)‚Äîbut the fault belongs less to the stewards of democracy and their flacks for behaving thus than to the public who willingly consumes it. We are a deeply stupid republic, but as Didion quotes William Safire advising the Dukakis campaign, ‚ÄúWe hate to be seen to be manipulated‚Äù (31). This is typical Didion: frame the norm such that its absurdity becomes obvious, then crucify someone with their own words. Safire, speaking on behalf of the American people, instead ridicules them. Bob Woodward, attempting to establish his thoroughness, instead reveals his methodological commitment to a scrupulous passivity untainted by thought: The discinclination of Mr. Woodward‚Äôs to exert cognitive energy on what he is told reaches critical mass in The Choice, where not much is said to the author by a candidate or potential candidate appears to have been deemed too insignificant for inclusion, too casual for documentation. (‚ÄùMost of them permitted me to tape-record the interviews, otherwise I took detailed notes.‚Äù) (Political Fictions 196) Didion‚Äôs prose here embodies the very principle it defends: Woodward‚Äôs inclusion of irrelevance is proven through the judicious selection of his most irrelevant sentence. No fat need (nor can) be trimmed from its meat. This otherwise laudable feature has drawbacks (to more than the the would-be parodist) apparent when inevitable tragedies occur: Nine months and five days ago, at approximately 9 o‚Äôclock on the evening of December 30, 2003, my husband, John Gregory Dunne, appeared to (or did) experience, at the table where he and I had just sat down to dinner in the living room of our apartment in New York, a sudden massive coronary event that caused his death. Our only child,...</span></a></div>
