        <meta name="description" content="Take my word for it: you do not want to watch this exchange between Ron Reagan and Pamela Geller. In it, Geller argues that she knows what Reagan Sr. would have thought about Sarah Palin because she agrees with his politics whereas Reagan Jr. does not. Because she agrees with Reagan Sr., she knows him better than his son: Geller: I don't think you can speak for your father, because you—you don't even espouse— Reagan: Pam, did you ever meet my father?She didn't have to. As per the title of this post, her claim is an epistemological one: knowledge acquired via telepathy with dead political allies is superior to knowledge acquired by actually knowing someone. When she declares that Reagan Jr. &quot;doesn't share the epistemology of the father,&quot; she's making a strong philosophical claim: because Reagan Jr. believes that knowledge acquired by actually knowing someone is superior to posthumous telepathic communication, Reagan Sr. did not. How does she know this? Her telepathy affords her access to documents unavailable to philosophical rubes: Geller: Did you ever meet the Founding Father? I've read everything he said. She has read the Complete Works of the Founding Father and you didn't even know they existed. Or that he did for that matter. But he did, they do, and she read them all despite never having met him, meaning she knows the Founding Father very well. Because she chose to read the Complete Works instead of communing with the Founding Father telepathically, she must believe that knowledge acquired by reading what someone has written is superior to posthumous telepathic communication. This points to a potential problem for her epistemological position: were Reagan Jr. to read a book written by Reagan Sr., Geller would be forced to claim that knowledge acquired by reading that is supplemented by actually knowing the author is superior to posthumous telepathic communication; but that cannot be true, as she earlier held that knowledge acquire by actually knowing someone was inferior to posthumous telepathic communication. She further complicates matters by asserting that actually knowing someone is a valid means of acquiring knowledge about them so long as that person also agrees with the person he or she knew. Her philosophy must therefore be one that only superficially embraces paradox—or the word &quot;epistemology&quot; is not one Geller actually knows, and she said it because she thought it would make her smart. She failed. Then she doubled down:Geller: You never met [Reagan Sr.] either. You know, you never met him either.Wishing someone was not who they are so they can't know what they know doesn't make for a sound epistemological foundation. It doesn't even make any sense. In all seriousness, she actually is claiming that people who agree with a person are better able to speculate about that person's beliefs than people who merely knew him or her.

			<p>Take my word for it: you do not want to watch <a href="http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/pam-geller-tries-tell-ron-reagan-jr">this exchange between Ron Reagan and Pamela Geller</a>. In it, Geller argues that she knows what Reagan Sr. would have thought about Sarah Palin <em>because she agrees with his politics</em> whereas Reagan Jr. does not. Because she agrees with Reagan Sr., she <em>knows him</em> better than his son:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Geller:</strong> I don&#39;t think you can speak for your father, because you—you don&#39;t even espouse—<strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>Reagan:</strong> Pam, did you ever meet my father?</p></blockquote>She
didn&#39;t have to. As per the title of this post, her claim is an
epistemological one: knowledge acquired via telepathy with dead
political allies is superior to knowledge acquired by actually knowing
someone. When she declares that Reagan Jr. &quot;doesn&#39;t share the
epistemology of the father,&quot; she&#39;s making a strong philosophical claim:
because Reagan Jr. believes that knowledge acquired by actually knowing
someone is superior to posthumous telepathic communication, Reagan Sr.
did not. How does she know this? Her telepathy affords her access to
documents unavailable to philosophical rubes:<br /><blockquote><strong>Geller:</strong> Did you ever meet the Founding Father? I&#39;ve read everything he said.</blockquote><p>She has read the <em>Complete Works</em> of the Founding Father <em>and you didn&#39;t even know they existed</em>. Or <em>that he did</em>
for that matter. But he did, they do, and she read them all despite
never having met him, meaning she knows the Founding Father very well.
Because she chose to read the <em>Complete Works</em><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>instead of
communing with the Founding Father telepathically, she must believe
that knowledge acquired by reading what someone has written is superior
to posthumous telepathic communication. This points to a potential
problem for her epistemological position: were Reagan Jr. to read a
book written by Reagan Sr., Geller would be forced to claim that
knowledge acquired by reading that is supplemented by actually knowing
the author is superior to posthumous telepathic communication; but that
cannot be true, as she earlier held that knowledge acquire by actually
knowing someone was inferior to posthumous telepathic communication.</p><p>She further complicates matters by <a href="http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2010/02/cain-and-abel-reagan.html">asserting</a> that actually knowing someone <em>is</em> a valid means of acquiring knowledge about them <em>so long as that person <strong>also</strong> agrees with the person he or she knew</em>.
Her philosophy must therefore be one that only superficially embraces

sense. In all seriousness, she actually is claiming that people who
agree with a person are better able to speculate about that person&#39;s
beliefs than people who merely knew him or her. That, obviously, is
nonsense: I&#39;m on the opposite end of the political spectrum from my
father, but if you wanted to know what he would think about a given
topic, you&#39;d be much off asking me than Pamela Geller.

Edroso is a hypocrite, you see, because he claims to be a feminist and someone else created an active element that appears on his page. On Tuesday at 12:41 p.m., Donald Douglas wrote a post about the new Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue in which he complains that &quot;Photobucket deletes any bikini images I've ever saved from SI, and it took practically no time for their prowling image-hawks to delete the brand new cover shot of Brooklyn Decker.&quot; Because Douglas never claimed to be a feminist, his saving bikini photographs to Photobucket for future use and prominently featuring an image of a topless woman on his blog is not hypocritical. It is, however, extraordinarily odious and, in all seriousness, absolutely unprofessional. Many have been fired for less. Imagine, for a moment, that you are a female in one of his classes who is having trouble with her assignment. He tells you to come talk to him during office hours, and when you do there are posters of women in various states of undress covering his walls. How comfortable would you feel? Would you consider his office a safe place, or would you be worried about where his eyes wandered when they broke contact with yours?I only ask because a blog functions somewhat like a virtual office: it is a private space that the public, including students, can access. It functions as an extension of your professional persona. I could understand if it transpired—as it often did when I taught literary journalism and had issues of Rolling Stone, GQ, and the like in my office—that a magazine on your desk contains provocative advertisements that are visible when you read the articles on the pages opposite them. This incidental appearance of contemporary marketing tactic would be the equivalent of Edroso's post at the Village Voice. I cannot, however, understand the rationale behind plastering the walls with images of objectified women approximately the same age as the students you teach. This deliberate decision to decorate with photographs that stimulate him would be the equivalent of the seventeen posts Douglas has devoted to what he himself calls &quot;fawning&quot; this year alone. &quot;If you don't like my fawning,&quot; he writes in that post, &quot;don't read the blog.&quot; Which is fine for readers of his blog—but what if you were a financially strapped female student in his course at Long Beach City College? What if you were searching for course materials and stumbled upon American Power—a blog written by the very person you needed to impress—and clicked through only to find countless images of objectified women and your professor complaining that the copyright holder of others prevents him from saving and displaying more? How comfortable would you feel sitting their in during office hours? Would the intensity in his eyes indicate an...</span></a></div>

I am, in fact, &quot;an ugly little twerp, and [Donald Douglas doesn't] mean that figuratively.&quot; He means that literally: the average height of American males is 5'10&quot;, so people who are 6'1&quot; like me are literally little. We are literally dwarfed by all those people three inches shorter than us. As to the rest, Douglas declares his intention to &quot;eschew substantive comments on [the argument I] posted&quot; in favor of unadulterated ad hominem: I'm a &quot;miniscule academic mountebank&quot; I represent &quot;all that is genuinely wicked and destructive in university culture today&quot; I'm a &quot;hate-pimp&quot; I'm &quot;a merchant of hate of the most despicable kind&quot; I'm a &quot;spindle of a man&quot; I disparage &quot;a true-academic's babe-blogging&quot; I also know how to use a hyphen properly, but that's neither here nor there. Douglas's only defense for the material he posts is that it &quot;doesn't bother [him] a bit&quot; because &quot;it's a free world, you know.&quot; I actually didn't know that, but I do know that I'm not surprised that Douglas read a post about material his students might find unsettling and responded by claiming that it doesn't bothers him.</span></a></div>
