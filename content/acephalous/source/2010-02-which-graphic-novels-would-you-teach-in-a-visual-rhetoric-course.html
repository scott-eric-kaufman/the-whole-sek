The problem, as you can probably guess, is deciding which ten books should we subject to sustained close-reading.

For example, this list lacks an overtly political book like Joe Sacco's Palestine; Gaiman is absent, as the narrative complexity of the Sandman trades would force him to be represented by a minor work like Black Orchid; Batman is nowhere to found, as we already have a Miller and a Moore, so The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight Returns are out, which means the Nolan films have no natural pair; etc. In an ideal world, what other works would you like to see us cover?" />

			The plan for the visual rhetoric book I&#39;m co-authoring is to have three or four substantial chapters focusing on 1) rhetoric generally, 2) the history of the medium, 3) the mechanics of comics, and 4) the rhetoric of comics, followed by ten chapters devoted to particular novels that instructors compel their students to purchase.&#0160; The problem, as you can probably guess, is deciding which ten books should we subject to sustained close-reading.&#0160; We&#39;re going to be leaning hard on McCloud&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006097625X/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Understanding Comics</em></a> throughout, but as for the ten other books, the list we&#39;ve compiled so far includes:
<ul>
<li>Alison Bechdel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0618871713/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Fun Home</em></a></li>
<li>Kohta Hirano, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159307056X/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Hellsing, Vol. 1</em></a></li>
<li>David Mazzucchelli, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307377326/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Asterios Polyp</em></a></li>
<li>Frank Miller, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1569714029/diesekoschmar-20"><em>300</em></a></li>
<li>Hayao Miyazaki, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591164087/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Vol. 1</em></a></li>
<li>Alan Moore, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0930289234/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Watchmen</em></a></li>

</ul>
<p>
The idea is to provide a wide variety of central texts to teach—as well as a template for doing so—which is why we have American comics, European comics, and manga; autobiographical works and books decked in tights; novels with readily available film adaptations (<em>300</em>, <em>Watchmen</em>, <em>Persepolis</em>) or companions (Miyazaki&#39;s <em>Nausicaä</em> and his animated features like <em>Howl&#39;s Moving Castle</em> or <em>Spirited Away</em>); etc.&#0160; In short, our concern is not to represent the best-and-brightest the medium has to offer, but to offer a selection of novels that will be useful to the greatest number of potential teachers. </p><p>For example, this list lacks an overtly political book like Joe Sacco&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/156097432X/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Palestine</em></a>; Gaiman is absent, as the narrative complexity of the <em>Sandman </em>trades would force him to be represented by a minor work like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0930289552/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Black Orchid</em></a>; Batman is nowhere to found, as we already have a Miller and a Moore, so <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401216676/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Killing Joke</em></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563893428/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Dark Knight Returns</em></a> are out, which means the Nolan films have no natural pair; etc.&#0160;&#0160; </p><p>In an ideal world, what other works would you like to see us cover?</p>

<p>As <em>Corrigan</em>, not only isn&#39;t it there, but Ware somehow didn&#39;t even enter the conversation.  I&#39;m not sure why, though.  It&#39;s not like debating the relative merits of <em>Fun Home</em> and <em>Blankets</em>, in which we decided to go with the former; it&#39;s more like we just blanked.  We did not, however, blank on <em>Black Hole</em>, which I just can&#39;t read because its shapes give me nightmares.  (I went digging for that old belle waring post in which she identified the name of the shape that bugs the both of us, but I can&#39;t find it now.)</p></span>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that Gaiman&#39;s work is <i>so</i> complex that a stand-alone chunk couldn&#39;t be profitably analyzed: The episode in the Inn before the Wake, for example, or the first collected volume which describes Morpheus&#39; liberation and recovery.  (leaving the remainder as an exercise for the class, of course!) But what about Gaiman and McKean&#39;s <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/works/Comics/Mr.+Punch+:+The+Tragical+Comedy+or+Comical+Tragedy/" rel="nofollow"><i>The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch</i></a>? It&#39;s got a lot of the same visual elements, and Gaiman himself has, apparently, called it one of his best works.</p>

<p>I&#39;d agree with GC, too: Maus probably belongs on the list, or an explanation.</p></span>

We have to exclude something, and excluding the work most likely to be taught in other courses is a decent criterion for omission, no?  Given that this book isn&#39;t intended to be a historical survey, mentioning <em>Maus</em> in the chapter on the genre&#39;s history should suffice, I think.  Those are professional reasons: the non-professional one is that I have extremely conflicted feelings about <em>Maus</em>, much of it having to do with the Holocaust-related story I <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/the-first-ever-.html" rel="nofollow">told in my joke of a podcast</a>.  That deserves its own post, though, so hold out for <em>Maus</em>.  </p>

<p>As for <em>Mr. Punch</em>, it&#39;s available, but not in print, meaning that the first class to use it would likely exhaust Amazon&#39;s reserves.</p></span>

<p>But if there were demand -- if it actually were likely to achieve some kind of classic status and regular use as a teaching text -- I imagine that it could come back into print. </p>

<p>I know, it&#39;s a problem. Still, it seems odd to omit one of the major movers of critical opinion, especially since it&#39;s so visually different from what you&#39;ve got on the list already. </p>

<p><i>300</i> does seem like a weak choice, though. Sure, it&#39;s a bit different. But it reminded me more of the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077869/" rel="nofollow">rotoscoped and incomplete Lord of the Rings</a> than anything else. I&#39;d still take a chunk of Gaiman/McKean over that. </p>

<p>Since you&#39;re already using McCloud, you can&#39;t use <i>Zot!</i>, which is too bad.</p></span>

I like the Nolan films as much as anyone, but I don&#39;t see why they have to be central or have to be included. However, if Batman is a must, you might want to consider either a Death in the Family or Grant Morrison&#39;s Black Glove. I mention Death in the Family not because it&#39;s necessarily a great story - although it does have a nice visual reference to La Pieta - but because it asked readers to vote on the Boy Wonder&#39;s fate. I picked Black Glove, recently collected I believe, because in some ways it is a straight forward Batman story, but W. H. Williams manages to incorporate a number of interesting intertextual storytelling devices. I might also like to see American Splendor on the list, but hey, it&#39;s your book. Who is your co-author? </p></span>

<p><em>But even so, 300?</em></p>

<p>First, as a Mets fan, your name <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbnVqDCuq1M#t=0m57s" rel="nofollow">always warms my heart</a>.  That said, <em>300</em> is in because my co-author has killer, classroom-tested material on the book.  It&#39;s not the best of Miller, but in terms of visuals, it&#39;s solid (if solidly neo-con).</p>

<p>Ahistoricality:</p>

<p><em>I imagine that it could come back into print. </em></p>

<p>I&#39;m saving the pipe dreams for the next book.  </p>

<p><em>Since you&#39;re already using McCloud, you can&#39;t use Zot!, which is too bad.</em></p>

<p>Given how we&#39;re using McCloud, in the discussion of the history of the genre, <em>Zot!</em> will certainly be making an appearance ... as will <em>Destroy!!!</em> (which fact I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll appreciate).</p>

<p>Adam:</p>

<p><em>why Batman?</em></p>

<p>The short answer is that <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/the-dark-knight/" rel="nofollow">I&#39;ve got a collection of really solid material on the films</a>, and I want to play to my strengths if we try to spin this off into a second book devoted to films.  </p>

<p><em>you might want to consider either a Death in the Family or Grant Morrison&#39;s Black Glove.</em></p>

<p>The only thing I can say about the Morrison is that while I &quot;get&quot; him, I <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/05/annals-of-fauxprundity-grant-morrison-is-writing-a-story-for-you-to-read.html" rel="nofollow">don&#39;t really &quot;get&quot; him</a>, and don&#39;t want to do the work (or my reputation) an injustice.</p>

<p><em>I might also like to see American Splendor on the list</em></p>

<p>I would too, but the thing about having to make cuts is that it&#39;s not just the material you don&#39;t like that ends up on the floor.</p></span>

<p>No, indeed.  A book on (say) modernist poetry could justify not including <i>The Waste Land</i> in any number of ways, but not including it <i>because</i> it&#39;s the most famous modernist poem would be deeply weird.</p>

<p>I think <i>Jimmy Corrigan</i> almost has to be on there; it&#39;s probably the most influential comic of the decade (it&#39;s hard to imagine <i>Asterios Polyp</i> without it).  And I agree with Caio that Clowes should really be on there—<i>Ghost World</i> probably.</p>

<p>Other good choices: the <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> books (lightweight, but good uses of the medium), and books by Jason (particularly his nonverbal comics).</p></span>

But if she had been a conservative it'd lead every evening news cast for two months.The crucial difference between this mass-shooting and other recent ones is that, for example, Nidal Hasan didn't consider himself a liberal, nor did he devote himself to liberal causes—he was, it seems, someone with pretensions to Islamic jihad. Scott Roeder, however, shot George Tiller in the service of a mainstream conservative cause. The difference, obviously, is not in the media's furtherance of a narrative, but in the non-incidental relation of particular ideologies with acts of violence. Conservatives complain 1) when liberals ask that any brown person with a funny name not be labeled a jihadist until evidence of such is unearthed, and 2) when mainstream news outlets link the murder of prominent abortion doctors to conservative causes. They fail to see the lack of equivalence: liberals don't espouse jihad against the United States, but conservatives do inspire those on their fringes to engage in politically motivated violence. The politics of the George Tiller murder are an indictment against conservative rhetoric because that rhetoric made Tiller a target; whereas the personal politics of Amy Bishop are utterly irrelevant in the absence of a vocal and sustained opposition to the existence of the university and the tenure system among liberals. That conservatives are working a false equivalence is made evident by Reynolds's pathological desire to find evidence that will allow him to turn this tragedy into mere political gamesmanship. Unlike his acolyte Althouse, whose affected contrarianism runs so vast and deep she'll write anything if she thinks one rube will do a double-take reading it, Reynolds plays politics to win. He wants to own the narrative, and because his platform trickles up into all the right places, he mostly has a legitimate claim to it. In this case, he hikes over to RateMyProfessor.com—a site that allows angry students to vent anonymously after they receive grades they deserve—and finds a comment in which an undergraduate calls her a &quot;socialist&quot; and before you know it, all the usual suspects are employing &quot;socialist&quot; as an anarthrous occupational nominal premodifier, e.g. &quot;socialist Alabama professor,&quot; &quot;socialist serial killer,&quot; etc. On the strength, then, of a single comment by an upset undergraduate, conservative hacks are folding socialism into what they imagine her profession to be—be it a professor or a serial killer—in an attempt to create the impression of equivalence between ideology and act where none actually exists. At least not yet. (The day still being young and all.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/02/rhetoric-amounts-to-more-than-what-you-advocate.html"><span><strong>Rhetoric amounts to more than what you advocate.</strong> The title should go without saying, but even among intelligent conservatives, sometimes it doesn't: The fact that a homicidal maniac shares your goals doesn't make you responsible for his methods. I never claimed otherwise. In point of fact, I didn't say that the ideological brethren of homicidal maniacs are responsible for the actions of homicidal maniacs. Quite the opposite. I claimed that there exists &quot;a non-incidental relation of particular ideologies with acts of violence,&quot; a fact no one who's ever opposed Islamic fundamentalism can deny. I further claimed that: conservatives do inspire those on their fringes to engage in politically motivated violence. The politics of the George Tiller murder are an indictment against conservative rhetoric because that rhetoric made Tiller a target[.] So as to this: Is it fair to say that I &quot;inspired&quot; Scott Roeder's actions if I have engaged in full-throated condemnation of partial-birth abortion (and I have)? If I accurately describe the horrific acts of violence involved in that monstrous process, does that rhetoric &quot;make&quot; an abortion doctor a &quot;target&quot;? My question would be, &quot;Have you, Patrick Frey, ever said anything like the following from mainstream conservative figure Rush Limbaugh?&quot; One of the things I strongly believe is that we are not going to, as individuals, erase evil from the world. That is God's task. But we can be soldiers in that process, and we can confront it when we see it. Now, is child abuse an evil? Of course it is. Child abuse is an evil, and we confront it, and we take children away from parents who are abusive all day, do we not? Well, if child abuse is evil, as Mr. Morrissey points out here, then infanticide is even more evil. In this comment, Patrick notes that both of us can point to cases on the right and left in which fringe figures &quot;advocate&quot; violence, and I'll concede that. But openly advocating violence isn't the issue here (if only because those who do so are immediately dismissed as the cowardly cranks they undoubtedly are). The issue is the rhetoric of violence, and I don't think anyone will deny the violence inherent in Limbaugh's rhetoric there. The phrase &quot;soldiers in that process,&quot; in which that &quot;process&quot; is stopping &quot;infanticide,&quot; is not neutral language. Envisioning opposition in martial terms encourages the mentally unstable to think of themselves in grandiose terms, e.g. as God's soldiers. Is Limbaugh encouraging people to murder abortion providers? Not directly. (Plausible deniability is the order of the day.) Is he encouraging those people invested in the cause of stopping infanticide to imagine that they’re &quot;soldiers&quot; in a &quot;process&quot; who should &quot;confront [evil] when [they] see it&quot;? Of course he is. How do I know that? Because that's what he said. He may not have meant it that way, but that's what he said. Trace the logic of his comment: God's task is to erase evil from the world. We can be soldiers in the process of erasing evil from the world. We...</span></a></div>
