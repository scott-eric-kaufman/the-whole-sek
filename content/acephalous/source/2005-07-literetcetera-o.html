(I know you know that, but this is a story and this is how a story starts. Chill.) One day my neurolinguistics professor learned me all about this thing which not a thing but a symptom of a problem demanding attention. She called this symptom of a problem &quot;jargonaphasia&quot; and it demands lengthy and rambling words strung together but barely grammatical and still somehow communicates something close to what the jargonaphasic patient intends. Jargonaphasia is most frequently caused by strokes. It is characterized by an inability or blockage to communicate discourse freely and directly without restraint but also by a tendency to engage in a proclivity for neologism. And the neologism is often a nonce-word, that is, one which applies to a specific situation and only that situation and never again is spoken or applies. To wit for example: Upon being shown a picture of a building the jargonaphasic patient (who I will call X. Cephalous) dislikes the tumbling words may include &quot;architorture.&quot;* Upon being played an acoustic version of the Cure's &quot;Fascination Street,&quot; X. Cephalous may ask about its &quot;dissynthegration.&quot; Upon being told of the way in which some Marxist thinkers hold fast to the theories of another Marxist Thinker, X. Cephalous may laugh at all those &quot;glomrads.&quot; Upon being shown a lecture of one prominent Marxist Thinker, X. Cephalous may inquire as to amount of his &quot;honorrhea.&quot; Upon being introduced to an unsufferable blowhard who brags endlessly about his imagined exploits in the Great Outdoors, X. Cephalous may comment on his hatred of &quot;kyacting.&quot;** In short, jargonaphasia sits on the boundary between literal language in which the reference is discernible and metaphorical language in which the referent runs away and demands the following of students of literature to discern and select among possible intended meanings. A jargonaphasic patient may describe an evelope as something that &quot;is a peculiar missive for demanding a disperse.&quot; A nail file flips its sounds around and &quot;is a knife, a knife tail, a knife, stale, stale knife.&quot; Scissors become &quot;groves, it's a groves, it's not really groves, two groves containing a comb, no, not a comb, two groves providing that a commandment is not now.&quot; I when I with pen, no, fingers and words with writing before, yes, before now I said at the boundary of literal and metaphorical language but I could have said literal, because literal, it is what it is, intended, a representative of its intended, not really, that would be metaphorical. Literal language aims at precision and sharply, decidedly tracks down after its referent, to which it refers, whereas metaphorical language chases, is chased, yes, is chased by readers who know it means but means not what, but knows not what. Do I fry fish which are larger and more important, intellectual, with this fish frying? I may, yes, perhaps but, but no promise, only when said not directly, immediately, no, not immediately but still said so known, yes.*** *More: Upon...</span></a></div>

As a nineteenth-century Americanist, I can't speak directly to the specifics of his claims, but if accurate they suggest a series of corrollary claims about the entire idea of what does and doesn't belong in &quot;the canon.&quot; First, the claims: works of literature exist as objects. objects qua objects must be examined from objects-as-literature. One must ask &quot;Who created/distributed/owned/read this object?&quot; &quot;non-literary topics impinge on these questions: Government licensing. Censorship laws. Copyright laws. Printing technology. Ink technology. Paper technology. Metal working technology (the casting of type, the creation of engravings and etchings). Labor laws &amp; traditions (for those who worked in the printshop). Advertising. Distribution networks. Literacy rates. Taxes. Commercial competition.&quot; as technology improves, the audience changes: &quot;Improbable as it might sound, the developing skills of metal workers--the ones who created type--could have had a direct bearing on the development of literature. If the only people who can afford to buy your books are the wealthy elite, then the content of your books will likely take their tastes into account. However, if you can make books more affordable, suddenly you start to pay attention to the tastes of those with less money to spend on any particular book.&quot; as copyright law changes, so too do the books published: &quot;We can look at publishing records and say, &quot;Aha! Text A was reprinted again and again and again. That must be because people liked it so much.&quot; Perhaps. But perhaps it survived because printers could make cheap copies and turn a quick profit. Had newer works been less bound up in copyright--i.e. free to be produced in cheap copies--they might have knocked those old perennials right out of the market.&quot; Given that this is the case, the old Arnoldian argument that literature is &quot;the best that has been known and thought&quot; needs an edit: &quot;the best that available technology and the whims of English copyright law has encouraged and disseminated.&quot; As an aesthetic, that kind of materialist argument has some problems, foremost among them it being a materialist explanation of what people like to consider an aesthetic process. But you know what? His explanation is foundational. As in, any aesthetic argument that seeks to formulate a theory of canon formation on purely aesthetic grounds must first contend with this materialist argument. The issue has never been about &quot;the best&quot; but about &quot;the best that remained.&quot; The process Gzombie describes checks the number of works that are in the literary marketplace at any given historical moment. That doesn't mean I can't argue, for example, that of the work that did survive, what is currently considered canonical is &quot;the best of that has been thought and known.&quot; An aesthetic criteria can still be appended to this materialist argument; however, the aesthetic argument can no longer assume that the works that have survived were predestined...</span></a></div>
