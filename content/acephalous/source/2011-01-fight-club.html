        <meta name="description" content="The first fifteen minutes of Fight Club strongly suggest to its audience that they're about to watch a much better film than the one they're actually watching—the critique of material culture has yet to embrace to the juvenile punk resistence of the novel and the depiction of insomnia is still pointed enough to be trenchant—so when I decided to teach it in my &quot;Confessional Narratives&quot; course, focusing almost entirely on the opening sequences was essentially a given. The problem is that David Fincher's direction is as busy as it is effective, if only because representing a state of fevered distraction tends to look a bit frenetic. (By my count, there are 659 cuts in the portion of the film I'm going to focus on, which means that any close reading of it will either be abridged or incomplete, depending on how trustworthy you think me.) I'll attempt to discuss the pace of the editing shortly, but for now I want to discuss why we even care. There are two lines of thought being represented in the first fifteen minutes of the film: the first is that the audience is being introduced to an unlikeable sociopath; the second is that the selfsame audience is being convinced to like him. How does that work? Via relentless frontality: when the audience stares into the void behind Edward Norton's eyes long enough, the void stares back until it becomes a welcoming presence. To wit: Note that the fourth wall is never actually being broken here: in the first image Norton is staring into space; the second, at his boss; the third, at a list of group meetings; and the fourth, into space again. I point this out because frontality conventionally works to distance the audience from the characters by pulling the characters out of the diegetic world of the film and into that of the audience. Here, however, Fincher is doing the exact opposite: he's enforcing an intimacy between the audience and a character it might not otherwise sympathize with (and rightly so). The audience identifies with Norton because it has stared into the void of his eyes and recognizes in them something inelegant and desperately wanting; and it does so because Fincher has provided them with no other choice. The film simply doesn't work if the sympathetic identification isn't immediately established. Hence, the frontality." />

<p>Well, yeah. That&#39;s just because the material is ham-fisted. It could easily let the viewer figure it out.</p>

<p><br />
<i>That is: we&#39;re being told we&#39;re cooler and better than people with the IKEA fetish[...]Or are we supposed to feel genuinely grieved when we spot the yin-yang table on the pavement?</i></p>

<p>The destroyed yin-yang table isn&#39;t ours, so we won&#39;t really feel anything for it. The idea is (as TOTEMOS said) to recognize yourself in Norton&#39;s character. You&#39;re not told that you&#39;re better than the people with the IKEA fetish, you are told that you ARE the people with the IKEA fetish. While you don&#39;t grieve for the yin-yang table, the intended effect is that you go home, stare at your Alessi lemon juicer or your Porsche Design knives, and think &quot;holy shit, I&#39;m a consumerist whore!&quot; I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re supposed to do after that, though.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0148c74d299d970c-content"><p>Maybe what Pahlniak (and adapter) are trying to do is show the schizoid nature of narrator/Tyler.  They show us a man who both feels utter contempt for the life of a successful yuppie and thus feels contempt for his own life.  The viewer (and reader) are meant to identify both with both aspects of the personality.  A great many white collar professionals have a lingering desire to actually be transgressive, to live on the margins free of bourgeois constraints, rather than enjoying material success.  The Narrator and alter ego are thus kind of a perfect sort of everyman.</p>

<p>The same sort of desire to take a path other than high school--&gt;undergrad--&gt;cubicle is what we see played on in this cringe-worthy Blackberry ad:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yctj_nc_oAk&" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yctj_nc_oAk&amp;</a></p>

<p>I think that the narrator confronting Durden near the end of the movie is basically being Freud to Durden&#39;s Nietzsche.  The one recognizes that we have all kinds of irrational desires that we simply <i>can&#39;t</i> give free rein and enjoy any sort of non-horrible existence, while the latter happily embraces them and damn the consequences.</p>

<p>But getting back to the beginning, I think that we&#39;re clearly meant to identify with the Narrator and the contempt for his own life so that we can to some extent identify with Durden and thus at least somewhat experience the main characters divided personality.  </p>

<p>Okay, that wasn&#39;t as coherent as I&#39;d like, but there&#39;s a reason I teach in a history rather than an English or rhetoric department.</p></span>

I&#39;m not a fan of the book or the movie, but I thought the movie amplified the material in the book that would cause people to think it was prankster manual on fighting materialism and um, phoniness I guess. Rather than a romantic comedy (which I definitely think it is but that&#39;s all I&#39;m saying for now). </p></span>

<p>What what what? It&#39;s been a long time since I read the book but I think I remember that both it and (<em>especially</em>) the film were mercilessly critical of the &#39;punk resistance&#39; of Project Mayhem (the Fight Club itself being kind of unobjectionable prior to the first of Tyler&#39;s homilies). The final chapter of the book (the creepy &#39;heaven&#39; bit w/Mayhem followers trying to yank the narrator back into the pseudo-resistance) drives home that interpretation for me - as do the film&#39;s innumerable ironies and self-spoofs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m disinclined to go to the mattresses over a movie these days, baby care and sleep loss being what they are, but I&#39;m baffled by a reading of <em>Fight Club<em> that sees the anarcho-narcissism of Act Two as the storyteller&#39;s final word on the moral matter. Am I missing something here?</p>

<p>(p.s. Just to lay out a couple more of my cards here: I consider <em>Fight Club</em> the best film of its miracle year, better  than <em>The Matrix</em> and <em>Three Kings</em> and <em>Malkovich</em> and <em>Rushmore</em> and all those motherfuckers, even a hair&#39;s breadth better than <em>Magnolia</em> which is like a private religious text for me. So there&#39;s a personal element here.)</p></span>

<p>I recall that at the time there was some discussion over whether the (film&#39;s) critique of Tyler Durden&#39;s puerile politics worked or not. </p>

<p>The other question was: if it failed, was it deliberate? Or was it more like Wall Street where, unless Micheal Douglas and Oliver Stone have been lying all these years, they were genuinely surprised and annoyed that so many people thought Gordon Gekko was a hero and that &quot;Yeah! Greed is good!&quot; was the message they took from the film.</p></span>

He claims that the fact that I taught a college freshmen who is currently projecting his or her issues onto me reflects my abilities as a teacher, and then includes my name in the title of his post in a deliberate attempt to undo the good deed I attempted to do -- which was to make it possible for people who were contacted by the person committing identity fraud to discover the fact that I wasn't the one who contacted them before, as happened earlier this week, that person takes a day off work in order to meet &quot;me&quot; so &quot;I&quot; could inspect the truck &quot;I&quot; expressed interest in buying. The Donalde, it follows, hates working class people who are trying to sell their trucks to make ends meet.

The standard caveat applies. I'll post the &quot;Slow Horror&quot; syllabus after I think of a better name for the course tomorrow and address the comments in the Fight Club post when I throw together my lesson plan for Thursday's class. The confessional narrative is not, strictly speaking, a medium (film, books, television, etc.) or a genre (romantic comedies, action movies, horror films, etc.). It is a mode; that is, it is less a kind of story and more a way of telling a story. In this class, we will examine works in the confessional mode in an attempt to define what features and characteristics belong to it. At the beginning of the quarter—which would be now—you will have to take my word that the works we will study are in the confessional mode; by the end of the quarter, I fully expect, and will in fact be disappointed if you don't challenge the assumptions on which my selections were based. The most salient element that the works you will encounter in this class share is that they are, in their own way, autobiographical; however, as autobiography is a genre, not a mode, it is possible for works that are not autobiographical to be written in the confessional mode. (We will be reading one such work, Daniel Clowes' Ghost World, at the end of the quarter.) The reason for studying this mode should be obvious: American culture, at this particular historical moment, is obsessively confessional. Be it Facebook and its ethos of “pics or it didn't happen” or a Tiger Woods press conference-cum-therapy session or films and television series “based on a true story,” Americans crave the kind of information that was once only shared in close quarters. In order to discover why that is, we must first understand how these narratives work; that is, we must figure out how they move us before we can discover why they do. To that end, we will be learning about rhetoric, a word so important to this class it must be bold. Rhetoric entails more than ethos, pathos and logos—the three elements which you likely learned in high school—it refers to all the techniques that an author or auteur uses to make his or her message appeal to a particular audience. In order to understand why a graphic novel appeals to an audience, we must first understand the rhetorical devices particular to it: panel transitions, word-picture relations, the visual vocabulary of film, etc. Similarly, in order to understand why a film appeals an audience, we must first understand the rhetorical devices particular to it: focal length, angle of framing, lighting, etc. We will devote the first few weeks of this quarter learning the terminology associated with both the comic and filmic mediums, then apply that knowledge to other works for the remainder of it. Texts: Fight Club (film) Blankets (graphic novel) Maus (graphic novel) American Born Chinese (graphic novel) Ghost World (film and...</span></a></div>
