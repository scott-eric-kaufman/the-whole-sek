I can only swing the manga/anime in because of the fact that the majority of my students read manga and watch anime, so they&#39;re intuitively aware of most of the conventions.  That said, I did not, in fact, think of <em>Persepolis</em> when lesson-planning, and you&#39;re right, it&#39;d be perfect.  I may just have to use it anyway, you know, do that thing where I pretend it&#39;s just a really innovative American book ... and telling them that I&#39;m doing that, of course.  Hm ...</p></span>

She went to high school with me, one year ahead of me.  <i>Potential</i> is her best book, about her junior year of high school (when she found out she was a lesbian).  It&#39;s funny, cartoony, and not too full of itself.  And the minor flaws it does have result from it being written when she was still in high school, which seems to work very well with the class theme anyway.</p></span>

<p>It sounds like a coming-of-age story at Amazon, or like something I could pair with <em>American Born Chinese</em>, if I wanted to teach that ... which I sorta don&#39;t.  As I mentioned in the LGM version of this post: I actually considered that for inclusion in the course—it will be in the book, so long as we can get publishing rights—but decided against it because it chronicles an experience so close to that of many of my students. I know that sounds counter-intuitive, but I’ve found that when students write about matters they can relate to, their essays become deeply personal instead of analytical, and that when you try to point out that this deeply personal essay they’ve written isn’t the rhetorical analysis they were asked to produce, they’re deeply and personally offended. Basically, it makes criticism impossible. However, once it’s established that they like the genre, I point out books like that instantly and they write me back later saying how much they loved them.</p>

<p><em>I really liked the film The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys ... but it was adapted from a short-story collection not a graphic novel. You gotta find a way to stuff it in, though.</em></p>

<p>As did I, but I need to stick to graphic novels for a course and book on visual rhetoric. </p>

<p><em>I still think I, and Hob on the LGM thread, had really good (in fact, the better) points suggesting that you were being too simplistic about Clowes. And you did say that you were going to reread DB and respond.</em></p>

<p>I did!  But my scanner broke and I couldn&#39;t find any scans online, and ... the other stuff you mention.  But yes, if I&#39;m going to use <em>Ghost World</em>, I&#39;ll definitely be revisiting that conversation.  And I&#39;m not familiar with Ariel Schrag, but will make my self so.</p>

<p>Also, someone at LGM mentioned Spiderman.  About which, all I&#39;ll say is: I did mention a &quot;general summer malaise,&quot; and with your aid, I&#39;ve proven it.</p></span>

<p>As Tom Lehrer pointed out there are many books and movies about characters who can&#39;t communicate with each other, and <i>Ghost World</i> works with that dynamic better than most and then managers to end on not one but two genuinely optimistic notes. The first of which suggests that, for all the difficulty it is possible for people to connect and the second which adds to that the possibility of unexplained transcendent good fortune.</p>

<p>I could happily elaborate, but I really think it&#39;s a remarkably well done movie.</p></span>

<p>Get an email address that doesn&#39;t fail!  That said, and needless to say, having read those 9,000-long comment threads on PW in which everyone hates happy the apostate, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll disagree about the means, only the ends.</p>

<p>But we both already knew that.</p>

<p>Also, and not for public consumption yet, the &quot;Everyone Hates Ackerman&quot; show will be canceled should Carlson ever publish the entire email in context.  Reason for which could be explained ... should you have a working email address.</p>

<p>And also again, I once, well, this link is informative: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/punch-spencer" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/punch-spencer</a></p>

<p>Nick:</p>

<p><em>I have to say that I&#39;ve never read Ghost World the graphic novel but the film is one of my favorite films of all time.</em></p>

<p>The movie&#39;s far superior to the book, but then again, that&#39;s because you can&#39;t make actual human beings as flat as drawn characters.  I know I need to get over my gut-level reaction to Clowes&#39; misanthropy, but it&#39;s difficult because it&#39;s like he and I were wired in a mirror, bound to forever receive the opposite of the signal someone intended to send.</p></span>

<p>I&#39;m beginning to understand why you don&#39;t want to teach Clowes. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not surprised to hear that the comic isn&#39;t as good as the movie, because the movie is amazingly good. But it sounds like you&#39;re probably wise to try to avoid including it in the course. </p></span>

Rest of your life and then some. So pick it right, but whatever it is, and don't pick anything not in this sleeve.&quot; He handed me a sleeve slipped full of CDs. I flipped through with trepidation, knowing that I'd remember this song forever, for the rest of my life and then some, so I had to pick it right ... &quot;Whatever it is,&quot; he said, as apparently I'd been speaking aloud. So I found it, a song that accorded with what I'd been reading—which was all Kafka because of the course I'd be taking with Wolfgang Iser the upcoming Fall in my first quarter in grad school—a song about metamorphosis, about changing from a single into a married person, a song that was this song: Which is still, I think, still both my and my wife's favorite song by them, but was utterly inappropriate in retrospect. And at the moment. Not to mention generally. But for me, it was all about the metamorphosis—the changing into something, and someone, else on that day. Fuck the smashing into windshields, and fuck being hysterical and useless ... I've done and been that, both literally and metaphorically, and it hasn't changed the fact that as the rain came down and drenched the pastor, my future wife and me, as we were the only ones not under the wedding tent, I had but one thought in my head. I knew nothing other than, I say, I knew nothing other than: I want to kiss this woman. I had vows to say, but: I want to kiss this woman. Even as the vows were spoken to me, I couldn't remember them. I want to kiss this woman. I was fixated on one thing and one thing alone: I want to kiss this woman. A conviction unakin to any I'd ever experienced before: I want to kiss this woman. It seemed like hours: I want to kiss this woman. Passed before I: I want to kiss this woman. Could: I want to kiss this woman. And it's burned me hollow every day of the months it's been since I have. Happy anniversary, my beautiful wife. Spend it wisely, well, and don't let it let you down ...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/07/interinception.html"><span><strong>Inter-Inception</strong> It appears as if my wife and I are the only two people on the face of the planet who hated Inception. She walked out about an hour and change into it—immediately before the tedious exposition that made the rest of the film thuddingly predictable—and I followed shortly thereafter. Spoilers follow under the fold. As soon as the ersatz Ra's Al Ghul from Batman Begins got shot the film screamed its circularity. Once the rules about dying in one dream level were explained, the mechanism of that circularity became obvious, as did the fact that the &quot;cliffhanger&quot; would consist of whether or not Cobb was really in the really real world or just in another dream. Which is pot-logic; by which I mean, the sort of thing you say when you're listening to Floyd in your dorm and everyone has their own bowl and is abusing it. &quot;Man, but what if this was all, like, a dream?&quot; &quot;I know, dude, but what if it's not even a person's? What if we're all, like, in a dog's dream?&quot; &quot;And the moment it wakes up to lick its balls? We like cease to exist?&quot; &quot;That is deep, dude.&quot; &quot;Totally.&quot; It's an infuriatingly stupid conceit, and asking the audience to accept it in order to make a film work is insulting.* I'll admit that film was finely composed: the plot circled back perfectly, i.e. the timing of the van versus the timing at the hotel versus the timing at the fortress and then Limbo. Limbo. What to say about that? The less more likely the better. Instead, I'll just note that psychological complexity in this film was figured like a wedding cake: &quot;depth&quot; literally entailed layers stacked one atop the other, such that the &quot;deeper&quot; one went, the &quot;deeper&quot; one was. Which is deep, dude. But the perfect circularity of the plot had another unintended consequence: the film felt like an exercise in empty formalism. I'm sorry, I misspoke: the film &quot;felt&quot; like nothing, because it generated sympathy for neither the characters nor the corporation at whose behest they toiled. When Nolan did attempt to make viewers care about the characters, he did so in the most grossly manipulative of manners: he killed a wife and quasi-orphaned some children. Only who cared? They weren't people so much as necessary elements of his orderly plotting, without whom he couldn't have knocked over that first domino. &quot;Dominoes&quot; aren't the operative metaphor here, though. Inception was the equivalent of watching a grandmaster play an uninspired game against the village idiot. There's brilliance there, certainly, but it's pointless and wasted. *My personal theory is that no one had the gumption to tell Nolan this because The Dark Knight was the highest grossing film of all time.</span></a></div>
