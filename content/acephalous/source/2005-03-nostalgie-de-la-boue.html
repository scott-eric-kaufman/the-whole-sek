			<p>Tom Wolfe unearths this gem--figuratively translated as &quot;romanticizing of primitive souls&quot; but meaning, literally, &quot;nostalgia for the mud&quot;--to describe the culture of the &quot;Radical Chic&quot; in the '71 essay of the same name.&nbsp; It encompasses a variety of pathetic phenomena, such as the one described in a <em>Vogue</em> article on &quot;Soul Food&quot; in which <em>Vogue</em>'s readers learn that</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;The cult of Soul Food is a form of Black self-awareness and, to a lesser degree, of white sympathy for the Black drive to self-reliance.&nbsp; It is as if those who ate the beans and greens of necessity in the cabin doorways were brought into communion with those who, not having to, eat those foods voluntarily as a sacrament.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>The younger Wolfe knew how to savage such pomposity:</p><blockquote><p><em>A little sacramental pone...as the young'uns skitter back in through the loblolly-pine cabin doorway to help Mama put the cinnamon, ginger, powdered cloves, and nutmeg back on the Leslie Foods &quot;Spice Island&quot; spice rack...and thereby finish up the communion with those who, not having to, eat those foods voluntarily as a sacrament.</em></p></blockquote><p>Let 'em hang from their own words and a few telling &quot;status details&quot; of the sort Wolfe championed in his infamous introduction to his <em>New Journalism </em>anthology, i.e. the &quot;everyday gestures, habits, manners, customs, styles of furniture, clothing, decoration, styles of traveling, eating, keeping house, modes of behaving towards children, servants, superior, inferiors, peers, plus the various looks, glances, poses, styles of walking and other symbolic details that might exist within a scene.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Radical Chic&quot; swells to burst with status detail.&nbsp; And well it should.&nbsp; He commends Balzac for being the &quot;secretary of French society,&quot; and he aims to be nothing less.*&nbsp; In 1971, he isn't:</p><blockquote><p><em>During the 1960's in New York nostalgie de la boue took the form of vogue of rock music, the twist-frug genre of dances, Pop Art, Camp, the courting of pet primitives such as the Rolling Stones and Jose Torres, and innumerable dress fashions summed up in the recurrent image of the wealthy young man with his turtleneck jersey meeting his muttonchops at mid-jowl, a la the 1962 Sixth Avenue Automat bohemian, bidding good night to an aging doorman dressed in the mode of an 1870 Austrian army colonel.</em></p></blockquote><p>The older Wolfe so loved this image concocted by his younger counterpart, he plagiarizes it in his introduction to <em>Hooking Up</em>:</p><blockquote><p><em>A doorman dressed like an Austrian Army colonel from the year 1870 holds open the door, and out comes a wan white boy wearing a baseball cap sideways; an outsized t-shirt, whose short sleeves fall below his elbows and whose tail hangs down over his hips; baggy cargo pants with flapped pockets running down the legs and a crotch hanging below his knees, and yards of material pooling about his ankles, all but obscuring the Lutz sneakers.&nbsp; This fashion was deliberately copied from the &quot;homeys&quot;--black youths on the streets of six New York slums....After passing the doorman, who tipped his visored officer's hat and said &quot;Good day,&quot; the boy walked twenty feet to a waiting sedan, where a driver with a visored officer's hat held open a rear door.</em></p></blockquote><p>Why not contrast these images?&nbsp; Wolfe obviously finds the ironies of the doorman/&quot;hip scion&quot; compelling--doesn't the &quot;nostalgia for the mud&quot; apply here too?&nbsp; Wolfe concludes that these &quot;homey&quot;-impersonating youths of '01, these &quot;sons of the rich, the very ones in line to inherit the bounties of the all-powerful United States, were consumed by a fear of being envied.&quot;&nbsp; Not that they're participating in a &quot;communion,&quot; however imaginary, with the &quot;homey&quot;-culture they emulate, which would make <em>these</em> sons of the rich pretty much <em>the other </em>sons of the rich Wolfe described in &quot;Radical Chic.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Wolfe's invisible throughout the first half of &quot;Radical Chic&quot; because, I presume, he's busying himself observing what's happening around him.&nbsp; No more.&nbsp; Now he relies on the ears and eyes of others to recount what he neither heard nor witnessed.&nbsp; That he's mining his own work for scenes of class-confusion isn't surprising.&nbsp; He is an institution to which everyone, including his own children, contribute observations.&nbsp; The dedication to <em>I am Charlotte Simmons</em> reads:</p><blockquote><p><em>I gave you the manuscript hoping you might vet it for undergraduate vocabulary. That you did. I learned that using the oath <span class="italic">Jesus Christ establishes the speaker as, among other things, middle-aged or older.&nbsp; So does the word fabulous, </span> as in “That’s fabulous!” Today the word is <span class="italic">awesome</span>. So does <span class="italic">jerk,</span>
as in “Whatta jerk!” It has been totally replaced by a
quaint anatomical metaphor. Students who load up conversations with <span class="italic">like</span>s and <span class="italic">totally</span>s, as in “like totally awesome,” are almost always females. The <span class="italic">totally</span>s
now give off such whiffs of parody, they are fading away, even as I
write. All that was quite in addition to the many times you rescued me
when I got in over my head trying to use current slang. What I never
imagined you could do—I couldn’t have done it at your
age—was to step back in the most detached way and point out the
workings of human nature in general and the esoteric workings of social
status in particular. I say “esoteric,” because in many
cases these were areas of life one would not ordinarily think of as
social at all. Given your powers of abstraction, your father had only
to reassemble the material he had accumulated visiting campuses across
the country.</em></p></blockquote> <p>Wolfe accumulates material as he once did, only now he must turn to his children to &quot;vet it for undergraduate vocabulary.&quot;&nbsp; Wolfe, as he once argued, wants to &quot;feign the tones&quot; of an insider &quot;in order to create the illusion of seeing the action throug the eyes of someone who was actually on the scene and involved in it, rather than a beige narrator.&quot;&nbsp; He called this illusion his &quot;downstage voice&quot; because it created the impression that &quot;characters downstage from the protagonist himself were talking.&quot;&nbsp; When Wolfe could stand downstage from the protagonists--be it the Black Panther Charity Brigade from &quot;Radical Chic&quot; or Baby Jane Holzer from &quot;Girl of the Year&quot;--the apparent authenticity of that downstage voice distinguished his prose from the hoard's.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Thirty years along, however, Wolfe isn't writing downstage--and not only because he's turned away from journalism and towards a novelistic social realism.&nbsp; He's writing from Row 14, Seat 42.&nbsp; He buys his tickets like the rest of us and drones on about what we've already seen.&nbsp; His prose no longer soars above the hoard's because now he sits within it.</p>

<p>*Bob Dylan's description of a Balzac novel in <em>Chronicles</em> is priceless: </p><blockquote><p><em>You can learn a lot from Mr. B.&nbsp; It's funny to have him as a companion.&nbsp; He wears a monk's robe and drinks endless cups of coffee.&nbsp; Too much sleep clogs up his mind.&nbsp; One of his teeth falls out, and he says &quot;What does this mean?&quot;&nbsp; He questions everything.&nbsp; His clothes catch fire on a candle.&nbsp; He wonders if fire is a good sign.</em></p></blockquote>

The Sin?  The Dated Rhetoric of Empowerment?</strong> I agree with the content of what follows. I agree with its intent. I agree with the programs it entails. But this writer believes that the masses will rally around a leader who howls from his finger-tips that &quot;ordinary people ... use race in [their] minds ... so that they have overlooked the true subjectivity and positionality of the very people they purport to liberate!&quot; (I've added an exclamation point because the sentence alone fails to communicate the prose's hoarse, shrill screech.) Here's the whole awful howl: Some Race Crits asked if their legal scholarship was too ethereal. They ve asked if they needed practical writings, ones purposefully directed toward the poor, the disempowered, and underrepresented. This shift in writing style, purpose, and focus confessed, at the very least, that Race Crits recognized that they were not effective. They were not plugging the leaky damn. Practical, activist, and engaged legal scholarship was perhaps the missing tool. Well, its [sic] not the tool. The real tool is the question that Race Crits fear to ask, and this question requires them to destroy race as a mindset, regardless of who wields it. Did they only intend to interrogate race so that they could wrest it from white clutches? If so, they should have achieved that end by exposing the degree to which white privilege invisibly operated in all of our lives. It s not enough. They still search for the silver bullet by which to kill the mangy werewolf called white racism. Perhaps Race Crits have not forged the silver bullet because they have not been prepared to destroy race altogether. Race is a concept that resides in our minds. We build our identity around this limited, liberal concept of the self. Our minds are not neutral places, but dynamic environs where we co-create ourselves, realities, and experiences. By not critically redressing how we, ordinary people, use race in our minds, Race Crits have engaged in a lesser degree of abstract analysis, so that they have overlooked the true subjectivity and positionality of the very people they purport to liberate. If so, why have Race Crits been unwilling to interrogate the subjectively positioned minds of ordinary people? They willingly probe white race consciousness. Ordinary people like minorities have consciousness too, and if so, is it raced? If a white race consciousness spoils and corrupts white citizens so that they consciously or otherwise engage in racist practices, then ordinary people like minorities differ little from white citizens, thus using their very powerful minds in self-annihilating ways so that they co-create realities and experiences that destroy, if not consistently delay, their best laid plans for self-actualization and self-empowerment. That this earnest and eminently sensible call to undermine the scientific nonsense that is &quot;race&quot; will go unheeded saddens me. That it will go unheeded because this writer, and others like him, know that this perspiring prose--with its sophomoric neologisms and painful academic cliches--increases his likelihood of someday landing tenure, well, let me finish that sentence...</span></a></div>
