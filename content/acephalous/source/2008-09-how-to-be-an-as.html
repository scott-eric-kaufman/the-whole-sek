		<span id="comment-130845326-content"><p>I just finished reading it all: the David Foster Wallace piece, which was excellent and John Ziegler&#39;s no-frills response. Suicide and analysis certainly don&#39;t mix. It&#39;s true that there&#39;s a definite cowardice to suicide, especially when family and children are involved. But it&#39;s presumptuous to guess that a man took his own life (!) to alter the impact of his artistic legacy. </p>

<p>That said, John Ziegler felt the Wallace piece was skewed or otherwise lacking in accuracy; and it is his blog for such rants. The radio piece by David Foster Wallace was excellent and unlike any other I&#39;ve read... rich with detail and studiocentric. </p>

<p>Who&#39;s not had a suicide in the family? My condolences go out to Mr. Wallace&#39;s wife, child and loved ones. In this case, his work will live on.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-130847550-content"><p>This is some state-of-the-art narcissism. I&#39;m going to show how out of touch I am with the mainstream, but is it well established that John Zeigler is a real person? Any chance he&#39;s just the creation of some comedian with too much time on her hands (or his)? Is that too much to hope for?</p>

<p>Congrats on the recent milestone, by the way--your post on Thursday brought back some memories. And luckily for you, Disneyland is just down the road...<br />

		<span id="comment-130896644-content"><p>Your &quot;french&quot; reminds me of the only time I have heard Bill Cosby utter a cuss word.  In a routine about drugs and drug use he asks a friend of his why he likes to do cocaine.  The friend responds: &quot;Well, it intensifies your personality.&quot;  Cosby thinks about this for a second, and then asks, &quot;What if you&#39;re an asshole?&quot;</p>

<p>Seems apropos.</p>

<p>Nice take down, by the way.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-130962504-content"><p>Couple things:<br />
1. You go, boy. (Or girl). Thank you for raising your hackles at this jackass.</p>

<p>2. Let&#39;s not be fooled. A good talk show host presses our buttons. This guy has an axe to grind. Hell, he might even be right in some of what he says. Maybe DFW did alter the truth in his &quot;Host&quot; piece. Maybe in his sad, brilliant head he did think about his Legacy and how dying on Friday couldn&#39;t hurt his standing. In fact, I&#39;d be surprised if he didn&#39;t. I&#39;d also be surprised if he didn&#39;t feel like a fraud at times, if he didn&#39;t beat himself up for feeling too much pride at being called a genius. <br />
On the other hand, a GREAT talk show host (which is about as important as a great bookshelf) can elevate discourse the way DFW elevated literature in the 90s. The way he helped students learn. The way he touched so many of us.</p>

<p>I kind of like this douchebag&#39;s piece. When everyone feels one way about someone, I start getting antsy. It cannot possibly all be true. I&#39;m glad to know he got under someone&#39;s skin so much that he decided to try to increase hits on his webpage and promote his own career by using a brilliant man&#39;s suicide as a mouthpiece for himself. It reminds me why I should continue to trust the words of David Foster Wallace.</p></span>

<p>I read the Ziegler piece in the Lobster anthology and had the rare feeling that Wallace was sort of bored with this one altogether but he was being a sport by fulfilling his commitment.</p>

<p>Ziegler&#39;s reaction is the same as anyone when they are dismissed by the cool kids. No doubt he sees readers of DFW books as some sort of elite liberal clique who scorn his kind out of hand for their earthiness. My sense is we&#39;re more like normal people who can smell a con.  </p></span>

I considered it. Acephalous is, after all, a record of the final three years of my graduate career. They weren't good years. When the ledger closes they will likely stand as the worst three years of my life. (Summary.) Some of that misery I brought on myself—anything having to do with anything online—but all of it flattened me as only perfect shit-storms can. If I seemed to handle disaster well, it was only because my coping mechanism suits this medium. But my life hadn't always been a drinking song. What began with random cancer simply snowballed. For the past three years everything that could go wrong has done so spectacularly. I'm only a consummate storyteller because I've been given an obscene wealth of good material. The sooner I put all this behind me the better. So that was the end of Acephalous. What began with anger should end with joy. I have other places to punish random people with random thoughts and outstanding invitations to write elsewhere. I don't need a place that reminds me daily of times most awful. But Acephalous is mine. My voice. All the terrible things I recorded here were written in a voice whose development can be tracked. When I began, my voice wafted contagious—when others smelled it, they vomited too. Now I'm almost willing own up to the fact that the words I inhabit belong to me. That they have carried me to the threshold of my story since the door opened on my story. They almost say me. So I'm not closing shop yet. I've only written 1,734 posts. I've only received 18,357 comments. I must go on.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/theres-too-much.html"><span><strong>David Foster Wallace Remembered</strong> (I wrote some of this shortly after learned of Wallace's death, but didn't publish it because it seemed too much about me. His kindness was in direct contrast to my arrogance—I needed to establish the latter before I could address the former—but it was still too focused on me. It wasn't until I read bianca steele's comment and dan visel and Kathleen Fitzpatrick's remembrances that I found a way to frame this rambling non-story.) Infinite Jest was published the second semester of my freshman year at LSU. Every time I saw someone lugging it around, I’d approach them. By the time I'd scaled half the novel, an informal reading group had created itself. (This is, I think, one of the reason his death has had the effect it’s had—so many of his readers transferred some bit of the intimacy they felt, based on the investment required to read IJ, to other readers.) This loose association of people who read Wallace, Pynchon, and Gaddis were the same people who’d be reading McSweeney’s, The Believer and n+1 a decade later. Because Wallace first brought us together, I always assumed narcissism drove my belief that he was responsible for the birth of arch-sentimentality. But I don't think it's narcissism. Without Wallace, there would've been no David Eggers, no Marco Roth, no Joss Whedon. Kathleen's tribute includes a quotation from the closing paragraphs of &quot;E Unibus Pluram&quot; (1993): [Mark] Leyner's work, the best image-fiction yet, is both amazing and forgettable, wonderful and oddly hollow. I'm finishing up by talking about it at length because, in its masterful reabsorption of the very features TV had absorbed from postmodern lit, it seems as of now the ultimate union of U.S. television and fiction. It seems also to limn the qualities of image-fiction itself in stark relief: the best stuff the subgenre's produced to date is hilarious, upsetting, sophisticated, and extremely shallow—and just plain doomed by its desire to ridicule a TV-culture whose ironic mockery of itself and all &quot;outdated&quot; value absorbs all ridicule. Leyner's attempt to &quot;respond&quot; to television via ironic genuflection is all too easily subsumed into the tired televisual ritual of mock worship. Entirely possible that my plangent cries about the impossibility of rebelling against an aura that promotes and attenuates all rebellion says more about my residency inside that aura, my own lack of vision, than it does about any exhaustion of U.S. fiction's possibilities. The next real literary &quot;rebels&quot; in this country might well emerge as some weird bunch of &quot;anti-rebels,&quot; born oglers who dare to back away from ironic watching, who have the childish gall actually to endorse single-entendre values. Who treat old untrendy human troubles and emotions in U.S. life with reverence and conviction. Who eschew self-consciousness and fatigue. These anti-rebels would be outdated, of course, before they even started. Too sincere. Clearly repressed. Backward, quaint, naive, anachronistic. Maybe that'll be the point, why they'll be the next real rebels. Real rebels, as far as I can see, risk things....</span></a></div>
