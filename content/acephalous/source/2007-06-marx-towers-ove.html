	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/sicko.html"><span><strong>Brief Review of Michael Moore's Sicko (updated)</strong> I should be working, but I can't stop thinking about Sicko, Michael Moore's new film, which (last night, but not this morning) could be viewed in its entirety here. (I link because it says that the video may become available again. I doubt it. I did download it, however, and will share it, so long as you have some server space to spare.) Why can't I stop thinking about it? Because it embodies everything that infuriates me about Moore. Before I say why, let me outline what it does well. It is devastating as propaganda. Only someone who's been denied coverage because doctors and lawyers quibble over the difference between &quot;cured&quot; and &quot;in remission&quot; can believe in this cause as I strongly as I do. Which cause is that? Socialized Medicine We already have socialist programs in America: police and fire departments, public schools, libraries, &amp;c. Moore points out that just because they're not called socialist doesn't mean they're not socialist in spirit. They are. With the exception of talk surrounding home-schooling and vouchers, no one is calling for a return to the days of private armies. (Not that they don't exist, only that there's no outcry that our military is too inefficient to get the job done, and that it'd be better if privatized.) Long Lines, Poor Care Moore does a fantastic job debunking the central myth of socialized medicine: that it leads interminable waits for routine procedures, and that even when performed, they are not up to American standards. As anyone who's ever known a Canadian or British citizen living in the US has long known, they find the quality of care in the United States abominable.
