			<p>In <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of-what-oh-really">my previous post</a>
 on “In Care Of,” I defined an “Oh Really” sequence as as structure of 
escalating exchanges that requires no dialogue to be understood. What I 
didn’t say — but which should make perfect sense in retrospect — is that
 such sequences are most often found in the saloons of classic American 
Westerns. Just consider what would happen to that scene if you put Don 
in a ridiculously large cowboy hat: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of-montage-042.jpg"><img alt="" height="1688" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of-montage-042.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of montage 04" width="499" /></a></p>
<p>Don didn’t need to take off his hat to inform us of impending 
violence: the structure of the shots and reverse shots is so familiar 
that the context of the scene matters more than the content. Two men 
being filmed in this manner in a “saloon” inevitably leads to fisticuffs
 and gun play. The logic of the escalation is “drunkenly   
disproportionate” <em>even if</em> neither of the parties involved is 
actually drunk. Because we know how this scene ends, Weiner need not 
actually show Don striking the minister. But we want him to. The tension
 mounts but Weiner provides no release — instead he relies on our 
familiarity with this sequence to cut to a flashback, because he knows 
we’ll only be momentarily confused. He effectively holds that tension in
 abeyance throughout the flashback, but instead of relieving it by 
cutting back to the scene at the bar like we want him to, he suspends it
 <em>in perpetuity</em> by moving the narrative a few hours forward in time:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of000231.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of000231.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00023" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>All of which is only to say that Weiner’s playing with the 
conventions of the “Oh Really” sequence in order to frustrate the the 
expectations of his audience. You may not have consciously recognized 
the structure of the scene when you watched “In Care Of,” but years of 
experience watching films and television conditioned you to be 
disappointed by its result. As well you should be. The entire episode’s 
structured around disappointment: from the title that doesn’t specify 
who or what’s “In Care Of” to Don and Ted’s respective beliefs about 
their prospects in New York; or from the firm’s feelings about Don’s 
recent performance to Peggy’s about the end of her relationship with Ted
 and the insult that is her temporary “promotion.” Weiner so wants us to
 be disappointed that — like the bar from the first episode of this 
season — he rewrites the most triumphant scene from the first season: <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/06/mad-men-the-wheel.html">Don’s presentation in “The Wheel.”</a></p>
<p>It’s not just the classic Draper pitch scene: its central concerns 
are creating a “sentimental bond with a product” via “nostalgia,” which 
is the same tactic Don uses to approach Hershey. But at that time Don’s 
life intruded into his presentation because he deliberately put it 
there. He was simply surprised by the results. As I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’s in a redoubled-blind here: he loathes Betty, but 
must pretend to  love her for the Eastman Kodak people; but as he’s 
pretending to love  her, he genuinely feels the nostalgia he thinks the 
Carousel will  mass-produce; but because he’s in the middle of a pitch, 
he has to hide  the fact that his appeals to nostalgia are working on 
him as powerfully  as they are on everyone else [...] Don’s trying, but 
failing, not to buy his own shtick here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this Don isn’t that Don. This Don <em>knows</em> he’s selling 
Hershey a shtick and he’s not buying it. He has absolutely no 
sentimental attachment to its elements and it shows in his performance. 
Here’s the first half of Don’s pitch in “The Wheel”:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/the-wheel.jpg"><img alt="" height="266" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/the-wheel.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="the wheel" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>You can read the whole post for why I compiled those images, but for 
now all that matters is the manner in which Weiner shot Draper during 
the Eastman Kodak presentation. It’s a single medium close-up on Don’s 
professional head as he’s unprofessionally moved by his own 
presentation. The steadiness of that medium close-up is indicative of a 
man who’s losing his shit with dignity. Not so with the Hershey 
presentation:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00047.png"><img alt="" height="281" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00047.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00047" width="501" /></a></p>
<p>Gone is the stolid medium close-up. In its place is a medium shot of a
 man who’s losing his shit in front an image of a giant metaphor for it.
 The reason for the medium shot here is not only to capture his manic 
action — he decided not to drink before the meeting — but also his 
instability:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00050.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00050.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00050" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Not only is he not dominating the shot — Ted’s unfocused head 
prevents that — but he’s using the chair for support. The medium shot 
allows us to see the unnatural arch of his hand and bend of his elbow, 
but more importantly it forces Jon Hamm to sell his smile in a grossly 
exaggerated fashion. His initial pitch to Hershey is as fake as that 
smile, and in seasons past, that wouldn’t have bothered him so long as 
the client bought it. And Hershey buys it. It’s a testament to his 
talent — a real victory for the man he wants to become — and for a 
moment Weiner reminds us of this visually with a near clone of <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017615b9ddc4970c-500wi">the medium close-up from “The Wheel”</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00055.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00055.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00055" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Except there are still differences. Without getting into too much 
detail, I’ll just say that in “The Wheel” he leans forward, toward the 
camera, dominating the screen; whereas in this episode, he leans back, 
attempting to appear like he doesn’t need the chair for support. Except 
he does. It’s important to note that at this moment, neither the 
audience in the room nor the one watching at home is meant to 
disappointed with Don’s performance. If anything it’s a more triumphant 
moment than the one in “The Wheel” because it’s more hard-earned. The 
only person who’s disappointed is Don. He’s failed to fall for his own 
shtick. He hasn’t been moved by his own presentation. So he attempts to 
recreate the circumstances of “The Wheel,” to move himself via actual 
nostalgia instead of manufactured narrative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m sorry, I have to say this, I don’t know if I’ll  ever
 see you again. I was an orphan. I grew up in Pennsylvania. In a whore 
house [...] I  read that some orphans had a different life in [Hershey].
 I could  picture it. I dreamt of it. Being wanted. Closest I felt to 
being  wanted was from a girl who made me go through her johns wallets 
while  they screwed. When I collected more than a dollar she’d buy me a 
Hershey  bar. And I would it eat it. Alone. In my room. With great 
ceremony.  Feeling like a normal kid. It said “sweet” on the package. It
 was the  only sweet thing in my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s unnerving about Don’s confession isn’t merely its context, 
which is captured neatly by this long shot in which we sit at the table 
with the other horrified onlookers:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00152.png"><img alt="" height="280" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mad-men-in-care-of00152.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mad men - in care of00152" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>What’s unnerving is that it’s <em>the opposite</em> of the “Oh Really” sequence, in which if we’re given the context, the content is immaterial. The content is<em> all</em>
 that matters. You can’t substitute other content into this context and 
produce the same result. Here Weiner’s playing with the show’s own 
conventions, not one of film generally, but he’s doing so for the same 
reason: to limit the audience’s ability to vicariously share in Don’s 
triumph. Except this time it’s the specific content of a specific moment
 that leads to our disappointment. By taking a different route to the 
same destination, Weiner’s preventing us from becoming complacent in our
 disappointment — every time we think we’ve become immune to its sting, 
he finds another way to make the pain feel fresh again.</p>
<p>All of which is setting the final moments of the episode in relief, as I’ll discuss in my next post.</p>

Oh Really?</strong> The season finale of Mad Men, “In Care Of,” contains an inordinate number of what I call “Oh Really?” reverse shots. They typically don’t involve dialogue — and the episode will end with one that doesn’t — but at the beginning of the episode it does. It’s also odd because it substitutes a flashback for an “Oh Really?” escalation, but I’m getting ahead of myself. When representatives from the Sheraton Royal Hawaiian arrive at whatever the name of the firm is at this point — because not knowing the firm is part of the point at this point — Don Draper isn’t in the office. You may remember the Royal Hawaiian from the season premier, and if you do, you can probably anticipate Don’s whereabouts. Here he is at the Royal Hawaiian: That’s the opening shot of Draper at the Royal Hawaiian’s bar. Note the quality of the light: there are two on screen sources — the lamp to Don’s left and the Tiki fixture to his right — and a noticeable off-screen, but still diegetic light illuminating the painting from above. The lighting is high-key, that is, the back and fill lights complement the key light in a way that creates low contrast between brighter and darker areas. (I write “complement” because there are many ways the effect of high-key lighting can be produced: all manners of angles and intensities come into play.) Of the previous episode, “The Quality of Mercy,” I noted that Don’s shadows were eating at his face because the back and fill lights weren’t providing it illumination. Even though his back is turned in the shot above, were Don to turn around his face would be plenty covered by the back light. All of which is only to say that the light is natural and gentle in this scene at the Royal Hawaiian bar. Which is significant given that when the Royal Hawaiian representatives arrive in New York, Don’s not available to greet them because he’s here: At this point, I hope you don’t need me to point out the structural similarities between these two shots. There are many ways to shoot a man at a bar — I know, I know — but to shoot the same man regarding relations with the same corporation in such a similar manner invites comparison. Whereas the scene at the Royal Hawaiian is lit in a high-key, this is clearly lit in the low-key that’s characterized Don’s relation to alcohol the past three episodes. (Just look at the poor man pouring vodka.) The low-key lighting allows the diegetic lights sources — the illuminated bar and the television set — to provide the majority of the illumination. Meaning there isn’t much of any because Don’s in a darker place. Remember the “dark wood” that Don read about Dante awakening in while at the Royal Hawaiian? Clearly Don hadn’t actually reached it yet. At the brightly lit bar he interacted with an American icon — the serviceman on shore leave...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2013/06/write-right-from-the-left-to-the-right-as-you-see-it-spelled-here.html"><span><strong>“Write right from the left to the right as you see it spelled here.”</strong> Given that I’m moving back to Louisiana, it only seems fair that I pass its literacy test before being granted the right to vote. Unfortunately, it seems I’m illiterate: 1. Draw a line around the number or letter of this sentence. How does one draw a line around something? I thought lines were those infinitely extendable things with no curvature. How I am supposed to draw a line around the number of this sentence? I have an idea! Wait — that’s three lines. Fuck. Maybe I should try to draw it around the letter of this sentence? Not that I know what that’d be. Do they mean “the” letter of the question or “the” letter of “this sentence.” Given that both the question and “this sentence” have more than one letter, I’m not exactly sure what they’re asking me to do. Maybe this? Granted that’s nine lines now, but they’re now “around” both “the” “letter” and “the” number and “the” word “number” in the question as well as the words “this sentence.” I may not be right but I can hardly be wrong. Moving on: 22. Place a cross over the tenth letter in this line, a line under the first space in this sentence, and circle around the last the in the second line of this sentence. I got a little confused over whether they meant the first space in this sentence or “this sentence,” but I made up for it: They didn’t ask me to draw Bad Ass Jesus struggling to get off the cross, but they didn’t not ask me to either. I’m sure they’ll appreciate it. What’s next? 29. Write every other word in this first line and print every third word in same line, (original type smaller and first line ended at comma) but capitalize the fifth word that you write. That’s it — I’m fucking illiterate. I don’t even know what the difference between “writing” and “printing” is. You win Louisiana! I won’t be casting any votes that matter anyway. Just once I’d love to live in a state where they do.</span></a></div>
