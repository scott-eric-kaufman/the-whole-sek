			<p>People disappear.&nbsp; </p>

<p>They wake up Tuesday morning and decide it's better to be a no one somewhere else than some damn fool soul here.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Happens all the time.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You expect a familiar face and are greeted by a stranger with a story. </p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;He moved to Michigan.&quot;</p>

<p><em>&quot;Michigan</em>?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter,_Michigan">Dexter</a>, I think.&nbsp; Not even a town.&nbsp; A village.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's in Dexter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A village.&nbsp; He wanted to live in one.&quot;</p></blockquote>













<p>Who could blame him?&nbsp; The living in hamlets ain't easy.&nbsp; (Settlements neither.)&nbsp; No one with any sense plants roots in unincorporated municipalities anymore.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Why <em>not</em> abscond to villages distant and remote?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Why <em>not</em> abandon the inessential and reinvent yourself somewhere pleasant? </p>





<p> The appeal's as obvious as it is compelling: no one appreciates the person rank circumstance created.&nbsp; Everyone thinks they could be <em>more</em> given a fair shake in honest environs.</p>

<p>Only everyone is wrong.</p>



<p>Some people are destined to fail spectacularly.&nbsp; Doesn't matter where they move to or who with, in two months their straits choke desperate.&nbsp; </p>

<p>They disappear into and become <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679722769/diesekoschmar-20">the Man in the Macintosh</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This they desire, to be anonymous and unknown, to flit from mourner to mourner without explaining anything to anyone.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Tortuous anonymity is palpable from space.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(Even in Michigan.)&nbsp; </p>

<p>Like Joyce I wonder who it is who makes this <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minyan"><span style="font-size: 1.2em;"><em>מנין</em></span></a></strong> sing:</p><blockquote><p><em>Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh? Now
who is he I'd like to know? Now, I'd give a trifle to know who he is.
Always someone turns up you never dreamt of. A fellow could live on his
lonesome all his life. Yes, he could. Still he'd have to get someone to
sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave. We all do.
Only man buries. No ants too. First thing strikes anybody. Bury the
dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life. Well then Friday buried
him. Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.</em></p></blockquote><p>We all come to look at it eventually.</p>

<p>Then we die.</p>

An older gentleman much loved by the young locals; who specialized in Pernod,<br />
from the end of a cobbled Oxford alley leading down to the Sheldonian where<br />
the penguins and their limos gathered for a fête for the Prince and Princess.<br />
Penguins! Effing penguins! Yelling perceptively. Perceptibly.<br />
He asked after the health of my finances then was shocked when I offered him <br />
a pound; knowing I was a foreigner he urged me to reconsider but no. A sip of<br />
Pernod was sufficient unto the late afternoon watching the penguins gather.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/02/michelle-obamas.html"><span><strong>Michelle Obama's Senior Thesis: Representative, though not as Embarrassing as Mine, Damn It</strong> Travis Kavulla has some &quot;Thoughts on Michelle Obama's Thesis.&quot; As his title suggests, they are neither smart nor sound thoughts: they are merely thoughts. Kavulla is not a dumb man. He may even be a nice man. So I grant, for the moment, that his thoughts on Michelle's Obama's thesis represent neither his mind nor his character; because if they did, they would speak quite poorly of both. First and foremost, the object of his critique is an undergraduate thesis. It is not written deliberately—with the care a graduate student would write a seminar paper or a law student compose a sample brief—but in bursts of research crammed in between unrelated coursework. (No scholar works on a paper while simultaneously trying to master studentized range distributions and Bowen's reaction series.*) So undergraduate theses tend to resemble fun-house reflections of their committee's interests. For example, remember my undergraduate thesis? Were someone to dredge it up when my wife went up for tenure on the assumption it reflected my current beliefs and standards, I would dismiss them as frivolous. My senior thesis is the product of an immature mind warping John Protevi's passion for continental philosophy into an embarrassing melange of big words and bad ideas. Like any successful undergraduate, I could outline [.pdf] other people's thoughts but had problems generating any of my own. So I did what every undergraduate does: I mimicked. I experimented. I minced the careful prose of my betters until it emitted a fragrance I thought odoriferous, everyone else odorous. But I've changed. In the years since I wrote my undergraduate thesis, I've learned how to parrot the conventions of my betters more convincingly, and that research consists of more than finding a theory that conveniently accounts for what I've already determined to be very important facts. In short, I've honed the skills I once wielded with all the subtlety of toddler with a broadsword. Now for the ironic part: I'd still be an oversized infant struggling to hack with a sword twice as wide as he was tall were it not for one of Kavulla's co-bloggers. When I first arrived in Irvine, I talked BIG TALK. I impressed people with my manifest impressiveness. One day, after witnessing me conquer fellow graduate students in an after-seminar bull-session, a fellow by the name of Jim Zeigler pulled me aside and recommended I read Mark Bauerlein's Literary Criticism: An Autopsy. I was humbled. Not that I agreed (or agree) with Bauerlein, but the idea that someone was challenging the theoretical orthodoxy I'd come to believe sacred was exactly the corrective I needed. I'd uncritically embraced post-modern/post-structuralist theory as an undergraduate and needed some distance. I needed to read something like this: [&quot;Discourse&quot;] has a loaded meaning, but a vague referent, and the vagueness is necessary to this mode of inquiry. In using it, critics can attenuate their descriptions, yet still sound authoritative. &quot;Discourse&quot; usage converts a methodological weakness into a theoretical exigency. &quot;Discourse&quot; is an essential constituent of inquiry,...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/02/one-of-these-th.html"><span><strong>One of These Things is not like the Other ...</strong> [Welcome readers of Pharyngula. If you want to look around, my &quot;Best of 2007&quot; posts would be a decent place to start. Or with my first &quot;Best of.&quot; Or with the second. Or you could remind yourself why this place looks familiar to PZ's readers.] I've been a fan of Tarsem Singh since being hypnotized by &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; in the 90s. His feature film debut, The Cell, somehow managed to make me forget I was watching a movie starring Jennifer Lopez. The trailer for his next film, The Fall, is now available, and it looks as stunning, hallucinogenic, and inscrutable as his past work. There's a hitch. Viewers aren't supposed to laugh uncontrollably during previews for epic tales told by recuperating soldiers to little children. Yet I did. I still want to see the movie, mind you, but the incongruity is so jarring, so unexpected ... I'll stop there. Watch the preview and experience it for yourself: Then join me in the comments to discuss it.</span></a></div>
