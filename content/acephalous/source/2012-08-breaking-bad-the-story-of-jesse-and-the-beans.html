Because of scenes like what I’ll call “The Story of Jesse and the Beans.” I suggested that the answer is the power of conventions: if you shoot a family sitting down to dinner, the audience will peg the frame as being realistic because they've seen so many television families sit down to dinner. And there's something to that. Quite a bit actually: film conventions normalize human relations. Consider the last frame from the previous post: Even if you've never seen the show, you know exactly what this is: a family sitting down to dinner. How do you know it's a family? Because there's a husband on the right and a wife on the left and a son in the middle? How do you know that's a son? Because he's smaller than the father and the mother. (Even if Aaron Paul were taller than Bryan Cranston or Anna Gunn, the director, Colin Bucksey, could make him appear smaller by staging the scene as he does here and simply placing Paul further away from the camera.) How do we know it's dinner? Because they're at the dinner table. But they eat breakfast at the dinner table too, which is why Bucksey doesn't backlight the window and instead employs the light above the table to illuminate the scene. I know they could be eating before dawn, but the mother has a wine glass in her hand and people don't conventionally drink wine with breakfast. All of which is a long way of saying that the elements in the frame demand it be read as an image of a nuclear family sitting down to dinner. This shot is effective because its formal conventions militate toward the nuclear family interpretation, whereas our knowledge about the content of this situation requires we draw the exact opposite conclusion. The tension between form and content creates an awkwardness analogous to the awkwardness each of the three characters in the scene currently feels. That's not a husband on the right nor is it a wife on the left: that's a terrorist on the right and that's his hostage on the left. That son isn't their son, though it could be said that the father adopted him—except that this surrogate son is only at this dinner table because he stopped by to break up with his fake father. And the mother only knows this soon-to-be-emancipated not-son as the father's former drug dealer. At this precise moment in time these people couldn't be more unrelated, but if I show you that frame your brain will insist that it's a nuclear family sitting down to dinner. Director Bucksey takes advantage of this.

At this precise moment in time these people couldn't be more unrelated, but if I show you that frame your brain will insist that it's a nuclear family sitting down to dinner. </p>
<p>Director Bucksey takes advantage of this. As I noted in the previous post, the sense of isolation experienced by each of these characters is typically reinforced by sequencing their conversations as a series of <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#51531" target="_self">shots and reverse shots</a>. The camera tells you that even though these people are in the middle of a conversation, there's something (literally the camera) preventing them from sharing the same filmic space. Even when they share the same <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/basic-terms.htm#25890" target="_self">diegetic space</a> they're still not together, and because we know that they seem more alone than they otherwise would. Given the circumstances outlined above, you'd assume that Bucksey would film this scene in a similar manner: establish that they're at the dinner table with an establishing shot and then hammer home their isolation with a series of reverses. But no. The irony is strong and painful:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744447be9970d-popup"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017744447be9970d" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00025" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744447be9970d-500wi" alt="Breaking bad00025" /></a></p>
<p>This is the kind of two shot that directors usually use to establish intimacy between characters. Skyler's doing something that under other circumstances violates a cultural taboo: she's watching him eat. Also note the appearance of physical proximity: Jesse's head seems dangerously close to violating Skyler's personal space. (In the sense that he's in her house, you could argue that he already has.) The minor deviations from social norms that seem to be at work in this scene wouldn't be deviations at all if these two people were what the establishing shot made them appear to be. Except we know that they aren't, which makes the framing of this shot all the more discomforting. That feeling of wrongness you felt when you first watched this scene? It's being compounded by Bucksey's ironic use of convention. To wit:</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/breaking-bad000421.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34573" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="breaking bad00042" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/breaking-bad000421.png" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></a>
</p>
<p>Jesse's dealing with the awkwardness of talking to Skyler by trying  to talk to Walter, but in another violation of social norms, Walter's  refusing to return Jesse's eye contact. So what does Jesse do? He starts  staring down at his food, which means there are now three people at  this dinner table staring at food: Skyler and Jesse at Jesse's and  Walter's at his own. They're refusing (or being refused) that most basic  of pleasantries: the acknowledgment of speech. Skyler and Walter's body  language signals the fact that whatever Jesse says doesn't matter—and  it doesn't, since he's complimenting Skyler on green beans she bought at  Albertson's—but the fact that they're reinforcing his irrelevance by  refusing eye contact ups the intensity of the awkwardness. (Especially  because part of the point of a medium close-up is to allow access to the  language of the face.) The viewer is essentially in the position of  being forced to watch a blind date in which both parties quickly decided  they loathed the other but neither wants to leave until after they  eaten. And so:
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/breaking-bad00050.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34575" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="breaking bad00050" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/breaking-bad00050.png" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></a><em></em></p>
<p><em>Of course</em> the scene ends with another two shot that should cement the relationship between these two character, and <em>of course </em>this  shot undermines that having Skyler talk to her wine glass. The overall  impression is that the people at this table matter less to Skyler than  the victuals. The particular impression of this frame, though, is that  by avoiding eye contact with Walter she can make Jesse disappear, and  she's right because <em>Voila! </em>he's gone. We know he's still in the diegetic space, but the camera's telling us that <em>even though he's still talking about the green beans</em> he's not important enough to include in-frame. The camera is making  these characters seem rude, the result being that we start to sympathize  with Jesse for the curt and summary dismissal. So why does all this  clever and deliberate staging and framing make <em>Breaking Bad</em> seem realistic?
</p>
<p>Because the slights created by the staging and framing are so minor  that the resulting pangs do an end-around on our suspension of  disbelief. On some level you know that the intensity of experience felt  when, for example, Luke Skywalker prepares to make his final run at the  end of <em>Star Wars</em> is false. It's too intense—and that intensity  reminds us of the beliefs we're actively suspending in order to enjoy  the film. This dinner does the opposite: because the transgressions are  so unexciting we drop our guard, and so instead of suspending our  disbelief we just sort of start believing. After all, it's not that  different from how life feels.
So it must be realistic.
</p>
<p>So it must be realistic.</p>

But as I start to catch up on the years of episode breakdowns and critical analyses, I can't help but be a little annoyed by the repeated claim about the show's &quot;realism.&quot; Joe Kugelmass wrote about this vis-a-vis The Wire, and though I can't seem to find the post, I want to give credit where it's due, because I'm no Zakaria. Joe's point, in brief, is that people always claim that The Wire is a realistic portrayal of the tangled mess of conflicting interests that is the great city of Baltimore, except that isn't realistic in the least. Consider one of the infamous &quot;Omar's coming!&quot; scenes: it's a classic Western sequence whose sole post-modern twist is that it's a shoot-out within a shoot-out. I'm not saying it's not clever or well-executed, only that it's highly stylized, i.e. not realistic and not attempting to be so. Breaking Bad is equally unrealistic, except unlike The Wire, whose overarching narrative does actually embrace a realistic ethos, Breaking Bad is a thoroughly naturalist narrative. What do I mean by &quot;naturalist&quot;? Even I'm not entirely sure. But a decent (if stripped) working definition might be that a naturalist work is any in which a person's character is determined by the restrictions of the social environment in which it operates. No matter what its author claims a naturalist narrative isn't a realistic project: it's a thought experiment that amounts to &quot;If I place Person A into Environment B how will he or she react?&quot; It may aim for realism but its logic is beholden only to itself. (Which is why naturalist novels often begin with a dentist winning a lottery ticket but end with a man handcuffed to a corpse in Death Valley.) Breaking Bad clearly fits into this tradition. A high school chemistry teacher learns he has cancer. He can't afford to pay for the treatment. What will he do? He'll make meth. How will inserting a tidy high school teacher into the seedy world of meth production and dealing change this man's character? The show's spent five seasons answering that question, and the answer, as is always the case with naturalist narratives, is astoundingly unpleasant. If you win the lottery, you kill your wife before dying alone in the desert cuffed to a stranger. If you win the cancer lottery, you can't afford treatment and estrange your wife such that she's counting down the days until your cancer can mount a comeback. In short: There is no good here. But there's no realism either. Naturalist narratives are necessarily and aggressively pessimistic. When presented with a choice between a creating a disturbing tableau and presenting the likely consequences of a particular course of actions, naturalist narratives opt for: Without giving away too much game, that's an image of a...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/08/obamas-dan-quayle-moment.html"><span><strong>Obama's &quot;Dan Quayle moment&quot;</strong> Surprise! It never happened. But I'm not opposed to conservatives claiming it did, if only because it makes my life even easier than it already was. Here's the allegedly damning image: Conservatives look at this and salivate: &quot;The President misspelled 'Ohio'! That's worse than misspelling 'potato' because 'potato' ain't a state!&quot; At the second link above—which I can't recommend clicking on, because that's what you have me for—the comments are largely anticipatory about how the mainstream media will spin this. One person heads off the excuse that the image has been reversed because in an image taken moments later, Obama's watch is still on his left arm. Another cracks wise about how Arabic is written from right-to-left and what we all know about Obama's real religious affiliation. But not a single one of them points out the blindingly obvious fact that the people in the picture are facing the camera. Which means that their left is the photographer's right. So from their perspective they're spelling &quot;O-H-I-O,&quot; which as many of you know is the proper spelling of &quot;Ohio.&quot; Not that there isn't a legitimate complaint to be made: I'm not sure I'm entirely comfortable with a Leader of the Free World not knowing how to spell out words via a human chain. What if that 3 a.m. phone call is from the Village People in 1978? An entire generation might be left wandering dark streets and darker alleys in a vain search for the ACMY.</span></a></div>
