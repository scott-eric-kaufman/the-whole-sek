The same applies for interdependent word-picture relations: Notice the difference between the examples McCloud used at the link and Kirkman and penciller Tony Moore's panel?

To be uncharitable: Kirkman is writing a television show that happens to be in a comic book and the fact that it was adapted is a function of its easy adaptability. But to say that would be to miss the point, which is that the ease with which it could be adapted obscures what has been lost in the translation to the small screen: because interior access is only very rarely granted, whatever is gained by withholding it in the book is lost in the transition to the screen.

<p>Unlike first-person voice overs in television and film, thought balloons and captions provide a window into the mind of character without calling attention to themselves as narrative devices.&#0160; In other words, there is nothing special about the audience&#39;s access to the mind of the characters because such access is a feature of the medium so ingrained as to be beneath notice.&#0160; A comic book in which such access is never granted creates characters whose motivations seem cryptic <em>despite the fact that such access is almost never granted on television or in film</em>.&#0160; To be uncharitable: Kirkman is writing a television show that happens to be in a comic book and the fact that it was adapted is a function of its easy adaptability.&#0160;</p>
<p>But to say that would be to miss the point, which is that the ease with which it could be adapted obscures what has been lost in the translation to the small screen: because interior access is only very rarely granted, whatever is gained by withholding it in the book is lost in the transition to the screen. <em>The characters will no longer be ciphers whose thoughts must be inferred from their words and actions: they will merely be characters on a television show.&#0160; </em>The implications for the television show are obvious: recreating the suspicious atmosphere of the comic must be done by other means ... which I will discuss when I teach the show next week.&#0160;</p>
<p>Returning to the panel above: the wordiness of that specific panel and the book generally creates some interesting formal difficulties, the most interesting of which relates to the disconnect between the single expression on his face and the time it would have taken him to speak all those words.&#0160; As represented in that panel, time is both slowing to a halt (visually) and speeding up (verbally).&#0160; Moreover, Shane&#39;s face must adequately account for all of the emotions he communicates in those text balloons because<em></em> the fact that <a href="http://www.blambot.com/images/gram_burst.jpg" target="_self">some of them are burst</a> means that some will be more strongly felt than others.*&#0160; It must account for both the double exclamation points in the first balloon and the ellipses that trail off his his quieter remarks in the third.&#0160;</p>
<p>How did Moore accomplish this?&#0160; He draws very well.&#0160; How was Kirkman complicit in this?&#0160; By <a href="http://www.blambot.com/images/gram_balloonballoon.jpg" target="_self">joining the balloons directly</a> instead of <a href="http://www.blambot.com/images/gram_connector.jpg" target="_self">connecting them</a>, Kirkman creates the impression that this entire speech is the articulation of a single train of thought.&#0160; It clearly isn&#39;t: his fear for his life intermingles with his need for a family and those two intertwine with his desire for creature comforts, but they are all independent emotions that become entangled <em>only when they all refer back to the same face</em>.&#0160; The wordiness works to Kirkman&#39;s advantage here: Shane becomes more psychologically complex because his single expression is associated with a host of conflicting emotion.&#0160;</p>
<p>In short: time is out of joint and even the simplest characters seem psychologically complex simply by dint of the wordiness.&#0160; The effect disorients the reader and leaves them unsure about their relation to narrative time or the characters—which is exactly the same situation in which the characters find themselves as they lose track of the days they&#39;ve lived in a world in which they must suspect that the motives of everyone are more complicated than they seem.</p>

<p>If nothing else, the tension makes the book interesting.  As Kirkman&#39;s noted in quite a few interviews, the story boils down to a group of traumatized people walking around and talking.  There&#39;s no over-arching plot element, which puts the narrative focus on how these survivors are coping with their survival.  The fact that he refuses to tell us directly via one of the unique (and expected) elements of the medium may be why it&#39;s so compelling.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e1b11a68970b-content"><p>Are you sure it&#39;s still expected, Scott? I&#39;m hard-pressed to think of many non-Marvel/DC comics that still use actual thought bubbles or captions for characters&#39; thoughts. In addition to Bone, Watchmen doesn&#39;t use them. Actually, Alan Moore talks about how he was surprised when David Lloyd suggested that they not use thought bubbles for V for Vendetta, and the captioning mostly disappears from that book after the first few issues. The only post-Watchman Moore works I can think of that uses them are Tom Strong and Tomorrow Stories, which are both going for a retro aesthetic.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see...Fun Home uses thought bubbles, so does Sin City, and both of them are extensively captioned. Sandman doesn&#39;t use thought bubbles, but does use captions, often as a third-person close perspective rather than first-person. Harvey Pekar uses both thought bubbles and captions, but he&#39;s mostly writing in an earlier era (and from a very first-person perspective). Seth, Chris Brown, and Adrian Tomine don&#39;t really use them. Even some off-Broadway type comics, like Preacher and Invisibles, don&#39;t (to my memory) use them. Works like Asterios Polyp, Jimmy Corrigan, and Scott Pilgrim do show characters&#39; thoughts, but more visually, not usually through words alone. I think that these methods really are used much less, and less conventionally, than they were in the past.</p>

<p>I think it is generational, and also I think that authors have come to prefer ways of communicating thought that are either subtler (facial expression, nuanced dialogue) or more direct (use of flashback, e.g.). Looking at Bone, for instance, in some ways it&#39;s externalized, but you also visit the characters&#39; dreams and memories at several points. I have to say I prefer the new style--when I read my old trade copy of Camelot 3000, or the captions in the first few issues of V for Vendetta, the interiority strikes me as artificial and stilted. The captions that are used well now are usually done for effective narrative: interposing Alison Bechdel&#39;s adult voice on her childhood events, or creating an authentically hardboiled voice in Sin City.</p></span>

From the opening prayer—some “Indian tribal thing” according to Powerline’s Paul Mirengoff—to the ubiquitous complaints about the audience’s reaction to a speech that even The Corner awarded the highest possible mark, the implication is that there is but a single proper way to celebrate a life and that any deviation from said way diminishes those being memorialized. The problem with that argument is that it’s false on its face. Were I to die an Irish cop my life might be celebrated with drink and song. If I were Ronnie James Dio, my life might be punctuated by heavy metal. If I were Jim Henson, I would go to my grave to the sound of singing puppets. Plainly put, if you criticize the way someone runs a memorial service because it differs from how you would, you reveal more about yourself than you might think. For example, you reveal that you have likely never been close enough to someone of a different religion, race or class to attend a service for or with them. I can only imagine what critics of the memorial might do if they attended a Jewish one: “Why are these people screaming and ripping off their clothes? Why is everyone pinning shreds of ripped cloth to their suits? Who organized all these pins?” If you actually have been close enough to someone of a different religion, race or class to attend a service for or with them and are still criticizing this execution of this one, you reveal the emptiness of your criticisms and the baseness of your convictions. By attempting to whip into a frenzy those who have never attended a service outside their ilk, you demonstrate that you care more for the success of your political compatriots than you do those being mourned. But if a large part of your constituency consists of people who attend mega-churches and you complain about this: You reveal yourself as a member of the Church of SASQUATCH ISREAL and will never be able to refudiate those who rightfully mock you.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/trying-to-appear-to-be-delivering-on-a-promise.html"><span><strong>Trying to appear to be delivering on a promise</strong> Over at National Review I learn that Eric Cantor insists that Republicans will do &quot;everything [they] can to delay and defund&quot; health care reform because they are &quot;about trying to deliver on our commitment, to make sure that the Obamacare bill does not take full hold and effect.&quot; Why doesn't he want it to take full effect? Because he knows that entitlement programs tend to be wildly popular. The logic is simple: if what Michele Bachmann calls &quot;the crown jewel of socialism&quot; succeeds, many of those previously uninsured voters will never vote Republican again. We know this. They know this. The base that Obama created in 2008 is far larger than the one the Republicans used to win the House in 2010 and they know that the 2012 demographics will look more like 2008 than 2010. The Republican's only option is to prevent Obama's base from further expanding, and the most effective way to do that is to delay the implementation of health care reform. Except they can't do that. The Senate will shoot them down. The President will veto them. So what can they do? They can spend the next two years &quot;trying to deliver on [their] commitment,&quot; because as John Boehner said, &quot;repeal means keeping a promise.&quot; Except it doesn't. What repeal actually means is creating and sustaining the appearance of trying to keep a promise. Failure to do so will shrink their newly established base and leave them as vulnerable in 2012 as they proved to be in 2008. Expect to see quite a bit of appearing to be trying to deliver on an undeliverable promise in the next few years.</span></a></div>
