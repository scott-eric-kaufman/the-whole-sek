<p>As with the actual sequence, the narrative remains &quot;Rick wakes up in a tent with his family and is happy.&quot;&#0160; However, consider what has been lost by removing the intervening panels: the reader doesn&#39;t acquire the same knowledge of Rick&#39;s <em>attitude</em> to these events.&#0160; Not to repeat myself, but what would be lost is the sense of interiority that the reader can acquire via a close study of a character&#39;s actions.&#0160; A moment-to-moment sequence of word-free panels, then, can have the effect of pulling the reader into closer sympathy with the characters.&#0160; It can obviously work otherwise: a more conventional usage would be a fight scene in which moment-to-moment transitions signal the speed and violence of the acts being represented.&#0160; But in <em>The Walking Dead </em>these dialogue-free moments help slow down the pace of a book that contains many of those more conventional scenes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Panel one is a medium-long shot with a low angle of framing (in order to make the zombies look more powerful), allowing the reader to observe Rick and his horse</li>
<li>Panel two employs a <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f4a56db8970b-500wi" target="_self">subject-to-subject transition</a> as the camera zooms into a medium close-up of the horse along Rick&#39;s eye-sight line, suggesting where before answering why Rick&#39;s attention is</li>
<li>Panel three returns via a subject-to-subject transition to a medium shot with a low angle of framing (to emphasize the power of the zombies), and the change from the medium-long shot to the medium indicates the increased immediacy of the danger Rick is in, as the zombie who was further away is now close enough to be captured in a medium shot</li>
<li>In panel four, the camera flouts the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180_degree_rule" target="_self">180° rule</a>—Rick should still be looking to his right—and pulls in for a medium close-up shot from a high angle of framing (in order to make Rick look more powerless) </li>
<li>Panel five cuts via a subject-to-subject position to a close-up of the zombie&#39;s face as Rick plants his axe in it, suggesting that Rick moved from his prone position to an attacking one very quickly</li>
<li>Panel six zooms back to the medium shot in panel three to show Rick on the ground looking powerless</li>
<li>Panel seven holds the same camera distance, but the fact that Rick is now upright demonstrates how quickly he stood up and, because the low angle of framing now tilts the camera up at him, he looks as powerful as the zombie did in panel three</li>
</ul>
<p>Panels six and seven are classic examples of moment-to-moment transition: the single action consists of Rick getting up and in order to demonstrate how quickly he does so, Kirkman employs a moment-to-moment transition.&#0160; But here one problem with McCloud&#39;s definitions becomes clear: what constitues a single action?&#0160; In the moment-to-moment example linked above, &quot;falling&quot; clearly does; but in his example of <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef013487c54f36970c-500wi" target="_self">action-to-action</a>, swinging a baseball bat doesn&#39;t.&#0160; All of which is only to say that every determination of what transition is being employed is arguable and therefore must be accompanied by an argument.&#0160;</p>
<p>*I can find no example at the moment, but it&#39;s a running gag: &quot;First you  say you want more fighting, then you complain that it only took you  three minutes to read the book.&quot;&#0160;</p>

this makes sense EXCEPT for the action itself. Does Rick get up, ax the zombie, then fall back down, and then get up again? That seems to be what&#39;s implied by P5...but maybe P5 ought to be (or ought to have been) rotated diagonally. Then we could imagine the zombie looming over a prone Rick, who axes it in the forehead. Zombie falls to Rick&#39;s right, and then Rick stands up and pulls the ax out of the zombie in one action. I think this is what &#39;happened,&#39; but what prevents this from being shown is the rigid grid structure of the panels. Kirkman couldn&#39;t rotate the zombie slightly without losing the close up. My sense is that Kirkman experimented with various solutions to the problem of the looming zombie and finally just said &#39;fuck it,&#39; which means we have to have this weeble wooble Rick.</p></span>

I notice one other little thing. In the first panel, his finger is crooked up under his nose, and in the second, it&#39;s back down in a fist. That kind of lip stroking is something someone does when they&#39;re thinking, not really when they&#39;re just sleeping. Tiny, but telling, detail. Thanks for bringing attention to this craft.</p></span>

It&#39;s absolutely arguable, but there&#39;s one other detail in that panel that makes me think otherwise: the shiver.  What are we to make of that?  Following your argument, it could be because a breeze entered the tent, and he&#39;s shivering, which is why he looks toward the flap after pretending to be asleep ... and now I&#39;m convincing myself you were actually correct.</p>

<p>Karl: I missed your comment.  Stupid TypePad isn&#39;t sending me notices of them -- or they&#39;re ending up in my spam filter.  That said:</p>

<blockquote>My sense is that Kirkman experimented with various solutions to the problem of the looming zombie and finally just said &#39;fuck it,&#39; which means we have to have this weeble wooble Rick.</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why failed experiment is more probable than deliberate weeble-wobbling.  After all, in a scrum, weeble-wobbling tends to be the norm.  A consistent camera level and angle actually do a disservice to the constant movement involved in a fight.  Think about boxing, which is largely framed from a single distance in order to allow the viewer to see the entirety of the fight.  Now, imagine if you wanted the viewer to sympathize more with one or the other of the fighters: how you would do that?  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e22b7899970b-content"><p>Nice comment, Scott. Answer to your last question you already know: generally the POV of the fighter you want to sympathize with. <br />
In re: this particular fight, I don&#39;t think the reading of what happened as down up down and up again works to explain what&#39;s happening in the panels. I think he starts leaning on his left arm, ax in his right hand, zombie over him, he thoks the zombie with his ax-wielding right hand, zombie falls down, its weight forcing his right ax-holding arm down, he gets up, leans over his with left arm to dis-brain the ax, and is NOW, but only now, standing and ready. One thing we&#39;ve learned here: Rick is either left-handed or he&#39;s ambidextrous and favors his left hand. A serious geek would make sure this stays consistent through the comic.</p>

<p>The mystery panel is the THOK panel, where you believe Rick&#39;s standing, and I believe he&#39;s still prone, but the POV is from a peculiar angle, and an angle that&#39;s used nowhere else on that page. Hence my reading, and what I ALSO like about my reading is that it&#39;s about very much about formal elements and formal constraints (which is really what I think is at stake on this page). Maybe it&#39;s not fair to say Kirkman just went &#39;fuck it,&#39; but there&#39;s still something weird going on. I think.</p></span>

Because he knows that entitlement programs tend to be wildly popular. The logic is simple: if what Michele Bachmann calls &quot;the crown jewel of socialism&quot; succeeds, many of those previously uninsured voters will never vote Republican again. We know this. They know this. The base that Obama created in 2008 is far larger than the one the Republicans used to win the House in 2010 and they know that the 2012 demographics will look more like 2008 than 2010. The Republican's only option is to prevent Obama's base from further expanding, and the most effective way to do that is to delay the implementation of health care reform. Except they can't do that. The Senate will shoot them down. The President will veto them. So what can they do? They can spend the next two years &quot;trying to deliver on [their] commitment,&quot; because as John Boehner said, &quot;repeal means keeping a promise.&quot; Except it doesn't. What repeal actually means is creating and sustaining the appearance of trying to keep a promise. Failure to do so will shrink their newly established base and leave them as vulnerable in 2012 as they proved to be in 2008. Expect to see quite a bit of appearing to be trying to deliver on an undeliverable promise in the next few years.</span></a></div>
