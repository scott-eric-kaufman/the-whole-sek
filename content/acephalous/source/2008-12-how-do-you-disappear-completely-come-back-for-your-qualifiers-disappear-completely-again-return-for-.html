Leave of absence to live and work with partner in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  My father dies while I am away... complete loss of direction.  First child born in 2003.  Return to states and work as adjunct professor while also being the primary caretaker for my first son (house-husband).  Advance to candidacy in 2005 and then spend a considerable amount of time waiting for a field work opportunity to open in Tajikistan.  2006 begin field work in Ferghana valley - 2007 finish field work, have 2nd baby-- 2007 til now... completely stalled.  Presently I&#39;m looking for a job and trying to find a way to dig myself out of what amounts to a completely self-indulgent form of writers block... any suggestions?</p>

<p>throw in a few bouts of depression and you&#39;ve got the picture. </p>

A lot of programs are loath to admit that someone has packed it in and left academia altogether, and a lot of people are loath to admit that they&#39;ve packed it in and left academia altogether.  As for That Guy&#39;s spouse, as other commentators have mentioned, she&#39;s often paying the bills during that liminal stage in which he&#39;s gradually ceasing to become an academic.</p></span>

Not that she found this evasion particularly shocking: ‚ÄúThis was not an unpredictable occurence,‚Äù she wrote in 1998‚Äôs ‚ÄúClinton Agonistes.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese were not entirely unpredictable developments,‚Äù she writes in this month‚Äôs New York Review of Books. The baseness of American politics may never surprise her, but the stupidity of the American electorate rarely fails to. The object of her pithy restatements of talking points is never the political actor who mouths them (from whom nothing more nor better can be expected). In these moments, the indictment is always of the public too stupid to recognize the absurdity of issues: We heard repeatedly about ‚Äúour children,‚Äù or ‚Äúour kids,‚Äù who were, as presented, avid consumers of the Nightly News in whose presence sex had never been mentioned and discussions of the presidency were routine. (Political Fictions 233) We could argue over whether or not the McCain campaign had sufficiently vetted its candidate for vice-president, but take at face value the campaign‚Äôs description of that vetting as ‚Äúan exhaustive process‚Äù including a ‚Äúseventy-question survey.‚Äù (‚ÄùA Fateful Election‚Äú) She does recognize the complicity of the press in this‚Äîwhat with its ‚Äúarresting enthusiasm for overlooking the contradictions inherent in reporting that which only occurs in order to be reported‚Äù (Political Fictions 30)‚Äîbut the fault belongs less to the stewards of democracy and their flacks for behaving thus than to the public who willingly consumes it. We are a deeply stupid republic, but as Didion quotes William Safire advising the Dukakis campaign, ‚ÄúWe hate to be seen to be manipulated‚Äù (31). This is typical Didion: frame the norm such that its absurdity becomes obvious, then crucify someone with their own words. Safire, speaking on behalf of the American people, instead ridicules them. Bob Woodward, attempting to establish his thoroughness, instead reveals his methodological commitment to a scrupulous passivity untainted by thought: The discinclination of Mr. Woodward‚Äôs to exert cognitive energy on what he is told reaches critical mass in The Choice, where not much is said to the author by a candidate or potential candidate appears to have been deemed too insignificant for inclusion, too casual for documentation. (‚ÄùMost of them permitted me to tape-record the interviews, otherwise I took detailed notes.‚Äù) (Political Fictions 196) Didion‚Äôs prose here embodies the very principle it defends: Woodward‚Äôs inclusion of irrelevance is proven through the judicious selection of his most irrelevant sentence. No fat need (nor can) be trimmed from its meat. This otherwise laudable feature has drawbacks (to more than the the would-be parodist) apparent when inevitable tragedies occur: Nine months and five days ago, at approximately 9 o‚Äôclock on the evening of December 30, 2003, my husband, John Gregory Dunne, appeared to (or did) experience, at the table where he and I had just sat down to dinner in the living room of our apartment in New York, a sudden massive coronary event that caused his death. Our only child,...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/12/if-you-liked-annie-youll-love-rags-to-riches.html"><span><strong>&quot;If you liked Annie, you'll love Rags to Riches.&quot;*</strong> Today I learned that as often as I throw around the phrase &quot;Horatio Alger novels,&quot; I'd be hard-pressed to list many works that fit the bill. There are, of course, novels written by Horatio Alger, but even they only qualify on a technicality. (Plus, not all of Alger's novels rely on pluck and luck to drive the narrative.) Not that his novels weren't enormously popular, as over 17,000,000 million copies were sold in the 1860s through 1880s. Nor was their uplifting ideology incidental, as the popularity of C. B. Seymour's Self-Made Man (1858) and Freeman Hunt's Lives of American Merchants (1858) attest. But as pervasive as Alger's rags-to-riches ethos is assumed to be, I can't think of many novels which present‚Äîmuch less endorse‚Äîit. Literary scholars prefer to toss off references to humble bootstrappers as if hundreds upon thousands of novels described their ascent up the social ladder. Maybe there are, but most encounters with the phrase &quot;Horatio Alger novels&quot; are purely contrary. We have the first fifteen chapters of every Jack London novel. We have Robert Penn Warren calling Theodore Dreiser's The Financier an attempt to modernize the Horatio Alger myth (Homage 56). We have Richard Wright identifying it as the locus classicus of capitalist mystification in Black Boy: I dreamed of going north and writing books, novels. The North symbolized to me all that I had not felt and seen; it had no relation whatever to what actually existed. Yet, by imagining a place where everything was possible, I kept hope alive in me. But where had I got this notion of doing something in the future, of going away from home and accomplishing something that would be recognized by others? I had, of course, read my Horatio Alger stories, my pulp stories, and I knew my Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford series from cover to cover, though I had sense enough not to hope to get rich; even to my naive imagination that possibility was too remote.&quot; (161) What we have isn't a robust literary tradition of Horatio Alger-type novels so much as a steady stream of anti-Horatio Alger-type novels beginning with the last chapter of every London novel and Dreiser's Trilogy of Desire (about Frank Algernon Cowperwood) and continuing through naturalist eviscerations of pat moral didacticism in Wright and Saul Bellow's The Adventures of Augie March. Whither the tradition they counter? Wright's autobiography and Bellow's autobiographical novel clearly respond to the narrative form of Alger's novels, but that brings us back to Alger as the only author proper to his category. I'm tempted to say that this is yet another case of savvy critics trying to account for the popularity of atrocious novels by appealing to a grand ideology that predisposed a given audience to swallow shallow tripe‚Äîbut then my student, the one who humbled me this afternoon, wouldn't know the names of any earnest iterations of the Horatio Alger narrative. Any suggestions? *Being the tagline of NBC's ill-fated attempt to hijack Annie's bandwagon.</span></a></div>
