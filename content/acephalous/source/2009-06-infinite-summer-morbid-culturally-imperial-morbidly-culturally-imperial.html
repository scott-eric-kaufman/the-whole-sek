			<p>Am I alone in finding the whole idea of <a href="http://infinitesummer.org/"><em>Infinite Summer</em></a> a little morbid?&#0160; The renewed interest in David Foster Wallace’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316066524/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Infinite Jest</em></a>
is an obvious Good Thing—a first step toward popular as well as
academic canonization—but having lived through the recent Michael
Jackson Media Event, I can’t help but wonder whether the desire to read
Wallace’s novel is akin downloading <em>Thriller</em> because Some Important Someone died.&#0160; Do I sound like I’m thwacking some straw man with shovel?&#0160; Because I’m not:

. . . So why am I here?
</p>
<p>
The short answer is that David Foster Wallace died.</p></blockquote>
<p>
That’s <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/">Ezra Klein</a>, writing at <a href="http://asupposedlyfunblog.wordpress.com/2009/06/25/wy-am-i-here/"><em>A Supposedly Fun Blog</em></a>.&#0160;
I’m not complaining because famous bloggers (Matthew Yglesias and
Julian Sanchez among them) are horning in on my territory—although I
will note that the first thing I ever published online was a mediocre
seminar paper titled “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010420132921/www.ags.uci.edu/%7Eskaufman/papers/demand.htm">Demand and the Appearance of Freedom: The Role of Corporate Media in David Foster Wallace’s <em>Infinite Jest</em></a>,”
but only just to note it—nor, despite the above, am I really even
complaining that Klein’s interest was piqued by Foster Wallace’s
suicide, as a more charitable excerpt shows his interest to be far less
morbid:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The slightly longer answer is that David Foster Wallace
died and I cared. That was, to me, a surprise. Lots of people die. Just
the other day, Ed McMahon died. It hardly registered. But Wallace was
different. I read everything I could about his final days. I posted a
memoriam on my site. I watched readings on YouTube. It <em>affected</em>
me. I don’t know if it’s because he was a young writer who was felled
by the violent bubble and froth of his own mind and that a small part
of me relates to that. I don’t know if it’s because he was, in some
way, unique to my generation, and as such, one of my own.</p></blockquote>
<p>
In the end, what’s interesting about the 25-year-old Klein’s post about
the 46-year-old Foster Wallace’s novel is the notion that someone who
was 18 years old when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_in_music#Timeline">the Clash first performed in America</a> and someone who was 18 years old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Strummer">the year Joe Strummer died</a> can be said to belong to the same generation.&#0160; How does that work?&#0160; I’m tempted to blame it on the Internet: 
</p>
<p>
Once you could identify someone’s taste by the cut of their concert tee—<em>London Calling</em> vs. <em>Combat Rock</em>, The Clash vs. Operation Ivy, Operation Ivy vs. Rancid, &amp;c.—now that all these these bands (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_The_Dominoes_Fall">mostly</a>) belong to the past tense, they’re part of that enormous cultural pool from which <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8117619.stm">more recent generations</a>
sample freely.&#0160; For example, someone Klein’s age will never experience
the pain of the endless, fruitless search for something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clash_%28album%29">the first Clash album</a> (which, contrary to that link, has <em>not</em> been in print continuously since 1979), as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDNOW#Decline">CDNOW</a> was <em>in decline</em>
during his formative years.&#0160; To people for whom almost everything has
always been immediately available, the idea of what constitutes a
culturally-determined generation is bound to be a little fuzzy.&#0160; </p>
<p>
Note that I’m not criticizing Klein for being born in a time of
cultural plenty—I would rather not have spent the better part of a
decade searching <a href="http://rzero.com/books/Destroy.html">for this</a>
in vain—I’m merely pointing out that his inclusion of Foster Wallace
among his contemporaries dumbfounds me . . . unless I chalk it up to
the novel instead of the man.&#0160; Wallace might not be Klein’s
contemporary, but <em>Infinite Jest</em> could be.&#0160; Now that I’m reading it again, I’m struck by how <em>contemporary</em>
it feels.&#0160; Everything that annoyed me about it in 1996 still annoys me
now—the footnotes, subsidized time, the too-frequent self-indulgent
sentence—but everything that felt new in 1996 still feels new now. </p>
<p>
Given how we imagine ourselves into an intimacy with our favorite
authors, it makes sense for people twenty-five years younger than
Foster Wallace to feel a generational affinity for him on the basis of
his novel; but that doesn’t really work, now does it?&#0160; I mean in the <em>academic</em>
sense, the means by which we identify Author X as belonging to Period Y
and analyze his or her work in light of the aesthetic of Period Y.&#0160; We
don’t, in other words, seriously consider historical feelings of
contemporaneity the way we experience our own, inasmuch as I’m fourteen
years younger than Foster Wallace but, like Klein, count him as “one of
my own.” </p><p>(<em><a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/infinite_summer_morbid_culturally_imperial_morbidly_culturally_imperial/">x-posted</a></em>.)</p>

<p>I _liked_ the idea of Infinite Summer and came _this_ close to buying the novel except I felt too guilty about my various stalled writing projects and was sure that I&#39;d avoid them by throwing myself into the book. So mleah!</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t the cool part of this idea that it would be creating a community through shared experience? (both the death and the reading --- or I should say the mourning and the reading --- both of which are usually so solitary.) I mean, except for your Mr. Morbid example there.</p></span>

<p>Especially when you put it that way.</p>

<p><em>I think the affinity one feels for a certain piece of art once it has been appropriated supercedes or maybe transgresses the temporal boundary that says there is distance between artist and admirer, especially in a chronological sense, and binds them together in an onotological sense. The space created by great art is atemporal, therefore there is the genuine possibility of an interpretation whereby one joins into a kind of contemporaneity and even a simultaneity with both the art and the artist...or not.</em></p>

<p>If you&#39;re saying what I think you&#39;re saying, then yes, one way of looking at art is as something that transgresses temporal and cultural boundaries (think Shakespeare in Nigerian theater), but I don&#39;t think that same logic holds for contemporary cultural artifacts.  I&#39;m not sure judgments of greatness really stick to contemporary literature the same way they do to properly canonized works, which is why I brought the Clash up: in 1979, they were another hyped punk band that might amount to something, but by 2001 they were, in essence, &quot;punk classics.&quot;  (The mind reels at that phrase, but you catch my drift.)</p>

<p><em>I (also twenty-five) read Ezra&#39;s comment as meaning something more along the lines of &quot;unique as a cultural artifact to my generation,&quot; and thus one of my own. Wallace is something that is consumable as a cultural monolith, first and originally, to our generation. Infinite Jest was new in 1996, yes, but it is our own now. None of that seems strange to me. Literary time is never immediate. Death seems almost a necessary impulse of its non-immediacy. </em></p>

<p>If you&#39;re saying that Foster Wallace comes to you pre-canonized, I see your point.  I had to argue him into respectability, but now his greatness is taken for granted.  I hadn&#39;t thought of it like that, but I suppose the same dynamic that I outline in my response to ZIRGAR obtains here . . . I&#39;m just so old I didn&#39;t even notice.  If you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;m going to go mourn my youth in the corner now.</p>

<p><em>Or, perhaps more simply, not being pop, literature moves more slowly. To whom does Gertrude Stein feel archaic?</em></p>

<p>Depends on what you consider literature.  I mean, have you read Coupland recently?  His &#39;90s material absolutely feels archaic.</p>

<p><em>Isn&#39;t the cool part of this idea that it would be creating a community through shared experience? (both the death and the reading --- or I should say the mourning and the reading --- both of which are usually so solitary.) </em></p>

<p>Absolutely, except the book and the mourning seem all tangled up in untoward ways here, which is my only caveat.  (Also, what Jake remembered I&#39;d said.  I like having a distributive memory.  Makes life so much easier.)</p>

<p><em>I didn&#39;t know there were things that annoyed Scott about the book.</em></p>

<p>You have to love a book to be earnestly annoyed by it, otherwise it just goes into the unread/unreadable bin.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef011570a66869970c-content"><p>I&#39;m 21, and conceived an interest in David Foster Wallace only after his death (in fact the reports of his death and various obits across the internet were the first I&#39;d heard of him at all). All I recall hearing was that various voices across the &#39;net whose opinion I respected spoke of Wallace as a genius and <i>Infinite Jest</i> as a work of genius; and being somewhat starved of literature at the time (I was living in Korea from a period shortly after Wallace&#39;s death) I decide to order that book online.</p>

<p><i>Infinite Jest</i> quickly consumed my life. I do not think it was the first serious work of literature I read (my tastes run to the fantastic and science-fictional, but certainly there is overlap, as with Banks, Mieville, Le Guin, Dick...) but it was the first to really engage me, to demand a level of attention and involvement that previously only Aristotle, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard had warranted (I am a once-and-future philosophy student, in case that comes off as unbearably pretentious). It is still, probably, the best book I have ever read. The only thing that comes close is that volume of Borges&#39; collected fictions.</p>

<p>My best friend is an English Lit grad and was delighted to see me finally engage with a work of literature (I have an illustrious former career as an sf/f nerd who dismisses all non-genre fiction as &quot;adultery in Westchester&quot;), and her promptings about <i>Infinite Jest</i>&#39;s resonances with other works (Madame Psychosis/metempsychosis in <i>Ulysses</i>, the decidedly Pynchon-esque character names, <i>et al</i>) have sparked in me a desire to learn more about this wonderful form that I&#39;ve apparently been missing out on all these years. So that is <i>Infinite Jest</i>&#39;s, and DFW&#39;s, legacy for me - without him I may never have noticed an entire universe. I actually plan on reading <i>Ulysses</i> next. Big leap for someone whose tastes had never been any more challenging than Robin Hobb.</p>

<p>Also, now I watch tennis. Andy Murray&#39;s through to the semis!</p></span>

I was deeply impressed and forwarded it several of my friends, who were likewise deeply impressed, and we exchanged a series of letters about it. Now, as to &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; -- I have begun reading it twice, and twice I have stopped short of the half-way point. Why? Not because it was too &quot;difficult&quot; or that I found the prose impenetrable or because I couldn&#39;t fathom (most) of what was going on. I stopped because more important tasks call to me. Tasks with rewards for self and others. Activities in the sunshine. Good books to read. I won&#39;t invest the requisite time and effort in tracing through this tedious and self-involved novel. &quot;Ulysses&quot; it ain&#39;t. </p></span>

This is not even to mention that Infinite Jest, you know, &quot;takes place&quot; close to 2009.  Without daring to assign some superhuman prescience to Wallace: Citi Field? Skype?  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any great surprise the novel might feel entirely contemporary to readers who were barely literate in 1996.</p></span>

Too much is at stake.”</strong> (by request.) As all actual, practicing literary critics know, few sentences in critical works scream tendentiousness louder than: What should be transparent to any literary critic is that . . . Literary matters are only &quot;transparent&quot; when they're not properly literary. If something is transparent, you don't need a literary critic to ponder the depths it doesn't have—any old idiot will suffice. And that's exactly why Jack Cashill, author of the above and an idiot of long-standing, is just the man to prove that Bill Ayers wrote Obama's autobiography, Dreams From My Father. For Cashill and his mysterious contributors (&quot;[t]he media punishment that Joe the Plumber received&quot; requires they remain anonymous), the case against Obama is a compelling one: What Mr. Midwest noticed recently is that both Ayers in [A Kind and Just Parent] and Obama in [Dreams From My Father] make reference to the poet Carl Sandburg. In itself, this is not a grand revelation. Let us call it a C-level match. Obama and Ayers seem to have shared the same library in any case . . . Ayers and Obama, however, go beyond citing Sandburg. Each quotes the opening line of his poem &quot;Chicago&quot; . . . This I would call a B-level match. What raises it up a notch to an A-level match is the fact that both misquote &quot;Chicago,&quot; and they do so in exactly the same way. So both Ayers and Obama misquote the opening line of Carl Sandburg's &quot;Chicago,&quot; substituting &quot;hog butcher to the world&quot; for &quot;hog butcher for the world.&quot; This mutual error would be significant (an &quot;A-level match&quot;) if Ayers and Obama were the only two people who ever made it, but according to Google Book Search—a secret search engine to which only I have access—the same mistake has been made by Nelson Algren, Alan Lomax, Andrei Codrescu, H.L. Mencken, Paul Krugman, Perry Miller, Donald Hall, Ed McBain, Saul Bellow, S.J. Perelman, Nathanaël West, Ezra Pound, Wright Morris, Allen Ginsberg, Langston Hughes, and the 1967 Illinois Commission on Automation and Technological Progress. (To name but a few.) According to Cashill, I have now proven that Dreams From My Father was written by many a dead man of American letters, a living mystery writer, a New York Times columnist and the 1967 Illinois Commission on Automation and Technological Progress. That bears repeating: I have an &quot;A-level match&quot; that proves that Obama's autobiography was written by a &quot;study of the economic and social effects of automation and other technological changes on industry, commerce, agriculture, education, manpower, and society in Illinois&quot; when Obama was only six years old. If that somehow fails to convey to the dubious merits of Cashill's argument, perhaps this will: Returning to the exotic, in his Indonesian backyard Obama discovered two &quot;birds of paradise&quot; running wild as well as chickens, ducks, and a &quot;yellow dog with a baleful howl.&quot; In [Ayers'] Fugitive Days, there is even more &quot;howling&quot; than there is in Dreams . . . In [A Kind and Just...</span></a></div>
