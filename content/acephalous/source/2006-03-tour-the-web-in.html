Definitively prove that you've attended a grand total of three classes by writing the single most wrong-headed paragraph I've ever read. Decide that &quot;seven to ten pages&quot; means &quot;four unfathomably foul ones.&quot; Pretend to have read what was required of you while admonishing Janet Malcolm for criticizing Truman Capote's In Cold Blood in her book about Joe McGinnis' Fatal Vision Cite a blurb from the back cover of The Perfect Storm. Misattribute it to the author. Misspell the author's name. And the title of the book. And the word &quot;and.&quot; As &quot;nads.&quot; Neglected to have been written your essay in English which resembling language.

I think he does believe in the unconscious, even if he doesn't realize it (and especially if the latter is true, how much the better evidence for the unconscious itself?). I believe this to be true because The Best Quotation in the History of Everything means little if the quote doesn't carry more weight in its very presence than it carries in its proportionality to the rest of S. Weir Mitchell's writing. Such is the acuteness of Laura's question: &quot;If you have read through reams &amp; reams of this writer and only found this one remark that fits your profile, isn't that kind of a slender peg?&quot; Well, of course it's not a slender peg, but only because its presence (singular though it seems) reveals that Mitchell was preoccupied by Lamarck, which is a way of saying that unconsciously Lamarck was &quot;in Mitchell's head.&quot; This is one of the significances of &quot;The Writer's Mark&quot;. Laura's question did flummox me. (So much so I tried and failed to answer it twice. Since the third time is by definition the charm, this will be my definitive answer. Unless it isn't.) But Mitchell'd articulated an opinion in absolute concord with the structure of thought whose existence I take inductive pains to document in my chapter. To see expressed in plain English undeniable proof of what I had I reasoned from Mitchell's not unsubstantial corpus brought joy to my heart and bounce to my step. Why? Here is where Rodney intervenes. He claims that what I found amounts to Mitchell's unconscious adoption of Lamarckian thought. A fine asseveration, that is, but not quite correct. Mitchell was not &quot;unconscious&quot; of his Lamarckian influence in the psychoanalytic sense. He was &quot;unconscious&quot; of them in the same way many literary critics are &quot;unconscious&quot; of the influence of Copernicus on their astronomical thought: it is unacknowledged—perhaps even unacknowledgeable—not unconscious. An unacknowledged intellectual debt which takes the form of a cultural assumption differs from an unconscious belief in that it isn't unconscious so much as unthought. It lives beneath the bayous of cultural literacy. In the thick muck among the crawdads and the nutria. Anyone who wants to find it can . . . only most choose not to. In this case most have chosen not to. &quot;Social Darwinism&quot; suffices for them. Because they want it to it so desperately . . . . . . so desperately they'll see it even if it ain't there. And it ain't. Don't believe me? Buy my dissertation. From me. It'll cost you a little less than a hybrid. But imagine the pain you'll be saving me. You can't count that in dollars. Only I can.</span></a></div>
