Evidence to the contrary, I'm writing a dissertation, not Mad Libs.</span></a></div>

Especially That One</strong> Someone's signing me up for listserv after listserv after listserv again. I'm convinced there's a database for conservative trolls to consult when they feel someone's maligned their dearly beloved. Copy, paste, then give that vicious liberal the spam he so richly deserves! However, there must be a glitch in their system: this is one of the lists to which I'm now subscribed. (Replace the slashes with &quot;a&quot; to view the site.) The email itself was so entertaining, I took a minute to learn about &quot;Mich/el Isr/el&quot;: Isr/el's work moves far beyond the act of painting and the final result of what is achieved on canvas. Yet, if only those portions of his work are considered, he may well be keeping company with some of the most brilliant artists. And while our First Amendment guarantees us the right to make any statement we wish, Mich/el believes that such freedom comes with the moral obligation to use it for good purpose and not sensationalism and vulgarity for the sake of profit and greed. Call me an elitist, but I'm not sure I'd want my official online biography to contain freshman comp. quality filler about the First Amendment. So, what is this work that &quot;moves far beyond the act of painting&quot;? The act of painting is just one component of his artistic expression in a fervently charged performance, one in which his audience is very much a part of the process. To date, there may not be a specific definition for Isr/el's work. Is it a performance? Is he a painter in the artistic sense? Is it a concert? A social commentary? An experience? The answers are all emphatically yes, yes, yes, yes and yes. It is all of those things and more. Mich/el Isr/el is an anomaly. What it is like to experience this anomaly? His performance encompasses a multitude of components. The initial and most obvious being the heart-pounding music, pulsing and reverberating, crescendos highlighting Mich/el's performance in perfect unison to his strokes, sometimes with double fisted paint brushes, others with only his hands. As he spins his canvas, round and round, back and forth, the audience is mesmerized [and covered in paint ], curious as to what his movements and strokes will reveal. Mich/el Isr/el, lithe and athletic, uses his whole body in what seems to be a magical, lyrical, exuberant dance, pulling his audience in as part of a heightened experience. To witness him in action is to think that he personifies the concept of kinetic art [and be covered in paint]. It is that and more, which defies definition. As his program builds to a booming, thrilling conclusion, audience members are left exhilarated and fulfilled [and covered in paint ], having been captivated by his hypnotic performance. Far more than an up-side-down portrait or abstract splashes Mich/el’s presentation exudes originality and significance. I concur: that and more do defy description. Or maybe I'm being uncharitable? For charities, Mich/el's performances raise awareness, goodwill, and funds on a grand scale....</span></a></div>
