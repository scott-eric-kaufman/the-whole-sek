Tyrion may be a &quot;halfman,&quot; but in the eyes of all watching, Clegane is perceived as half the &quot;man&quot; he was. When the camera reverses, another clever element of Marshall&#39;s blocking and framing becomes evident:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef016766ea15ef970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Game of thrones blackwater2012-05-29-11h57m34s122" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef016766ea15ef970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef016766ea15ef970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Game of thrones blackwater2012-05-29-11h57m34s122" /></a><br />By situating Tyrion half-way down the staircase, he avoids the infantalizing effect of the sea-of-crotches shot. Tyrion doesn&#39;t look like a child about to wrap his arms around his mother&#39;s leg—he looks like a man who&#39;s half-way down a staircase berating an underling. Note again the position of his head relative to the upper reaches of the frame, as Marshall appears to be doing all in his power to prevent the camera from robbing Tyrion of his.</p>
<p>As the scene continues, Marshall&#39;s intent becomes ever more apparent and ever more effective. For example, Clegane and Joffrey Lannister are both afforded medium shots with natural head-placement:</p>

However, when Marshall reverses to Tyrion:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef016766ea2693970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Game of thrones blackwater2012-05-29-11h57m50s17" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef016766ea2693970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef016766ea2693970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Game of thrones blackwater2012-05-29-11h57m50s17" /></a><br />He switches to a close-up that can&#39;t even contain the entirety of his head in frame. Tyrion is bigger than the shot, so to speak, such that at this moment the audience&#39;s knowledge of his height is only theoretical. That is to say, we know that he&#39;s a &quot;halfman,&quot; but his presence on screen is militating against that knowledge. Directors use these techniques to manipulate their audience on a non-intellectual level—think of the rousing effect a bit of non-diegetic music can have on an otherwise mundane scene—which means that the cumulative effect of Marshall&#39;s shot selection here is emotional. Tyrion is enlarged by the manner in which Marshall shot Dinklage. Don&#39;t believe me? Look at him two minutes later:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0168ebeba49b970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Game of thrones blackwater2012-05-29-11h58m32s185" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0168ebeba49b970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0168ebeba49b970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Game of thrones blackwater2012-05-29-11h58m32s185" /></a><br />His head&#39;s now effectively even with those of the soldiers behind him. How did that happen? I&#39;m not entirely sure, but that&#39;s not the point: as Tyrion prepares to lead his troops to battle to the cry of &quot;Halfman,&quot; Marshall manages to render the epithet inaccurate.&#0160;</p>
