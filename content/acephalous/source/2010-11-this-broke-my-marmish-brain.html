You&#39;re right that both examples are in the passive <i>voice</i>, but the distinction Perry is making is about structure, and &quot;active&quot; in this case refers to placing the subject first, rather than the context.</p>

<p>And I think Perry is rambling, which the following panel reinforces, which is why he&#39;s being so sloppy with the language: his brain isn&#39;t fully engaged in the conversation. Neither is Clark&#39;s, apparently. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef013488a4655d970c-content"><p>Hahaha, Scott, yes, clearly your brain ceased to function normally at some point; however, I&#39;m surprised that grading student papers didn&#39;t cause you to circle the whole rant and write &quot;logic - both are passive&quot; (or some such) in the margin.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m with Anodognosic. Straczynski just doesn&#39;t know his passive voice from a hole in the ground and this is a clear case for a Language Log rant. Wait, I&#39;ll do it. The verbs in both sentences are obviously and identically passive: was killed. Apologies to Ahistoricality, but passiveness or activeness applies only to verb structure, not clause or sentence structure. (You&#39;ll find people out there referring to &quot;passive structure&quot; but it means the same as &quot;passive voice,&quot; and I wish they&#39;d use the latter, because then maybe people would be less confused, since verbs and only verbs have voice. Then again, maybe people would find another way to be confused.) And subject-verb order doesn&#39;t determine voice, or else questions such as &quot;Have you eaten yet?&quot; with the subject in second position would be considered passive (they&#39;re not). At any rate, the subject-verb order is the same in both sentences (&quot;dog...was killed&quot;) -- it&#39;s only the adverbial phrase &quot;last night&quot; that&#39;s moved around. BUT, you can talk generally about the *liveliness* of the *style*, and since unnecessary passiveness can lead to wordiness, which deadens style (especially in word-budget conscious journalism), the inter-relatedness of the two (plus the misleading ways in which the concepts are often taught) may have confused Straczynski, like so many others before him.</p>

<p>Anyway, I only know this panel and its contents, but if the killer of the dog is unknown, the passive voice is actually *called for* here, no matter where you put the &quot;last night.&quot; The agent is unknown; hence, &quot;a dog was killed.&quot; A good reporter does NOT &quot;always&quot; go for the active voice.</p>

<p>Btw, when I read Straczynski, I thought Kaczynski (as in Ted, the Unabomber), and not just because of the -czynski. TK had an obsession with Strunk and White, who *also* didn&#39;t know the passive voice from a hole in the ground. Wait, Perry&#39;s last name is White...oh great, now *I&#39;m* over-reading the whole thing, too!</p></span>

<p>The Modesto Kid - FWIW, I think &quot;A dog was killed last night&quot; is better for two purely stylistic reasons: 1) it has better continuous rhythm (whereas the other version forces a short pause after &quot;Last night,...&quot;), and 2) it lets you know the focus of the story more immediately (a dog) vs. the context of the story (last night).  And that&#39;s probably what Straczynski was trying to get Perry to convey (see Ahistoricality&#39;s comment, which in my own addled state, I misread).</p></span>

<p>Honestly?  One of the reasons I prefer reading graphic novels is that it&#39;s almost physically impossible to write in their margins: either the paper stock is too glossy or the image too crowded for me to write anything substantial, so I&#39;m freed to just enjoy the book.  (This is the same reason I prefer Penguin editions of George Eliot, although there I can still annoy myself by underlining significant sentences.)</p>

<p><em>Scott, why aren&#39;t you writing your own graphic novel?</em></p>

<p>Because I have three unfinished prose ones?  Ha, like that would stop me.  Yes, I&#39;ve got one of those in the works, too, but it&#39;ll be years before 1) I have time to devote to it and 2) it sees the light of day.  Unless, of course, some well-connected reader wants to put me in touch with someone ...</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f5a9383f970b-content"><p>On the one hand, I agree with Ahistoricality that MJS was trying to have Perry White say that it&#39;s better to put the subject of the sentence first. (That is, that White is talking about structure rather than voice, and that his use of the word &quot;active&quot; is a red herring.) On the other hand, I agree with various people here that the most likely explanation for White&#39;s phrasing is that MJS (a) thought he was talking about active vs passive voice, but (b) wasn&#39;t entirely clear on what those are.</p>

<p>I say that because in my experience, many many people are confused by the terms &quot;active voice&quot; and &quot;passive voice.&quot;</p>

<p>For example, I&#39;ve lost count of the number of times people have told me things like, &quot;Well, &#39;hit&#39; is obviously a really active verb, so &#39;the ball was hit by him&#39; is active voice.&quot; That&#39;s not the same confusion displayed in this panel, of course; I&#39;m just saying that a lot of people, including a lot of people who ought to know better, aren&#39;t really clear on what exactly active voice is; they just know that whatever it is, it&#39;s better than passive voice.</p>

<p>...I love the idea that &quot;Someone killed a dog last night?&quot; could be a suggested active-voice alternative, but I agree that that reading isn&#39;t supported by the punctuation or by White&#39;s response. Too bad; that could&#39;ve been really clever dialogue.</p></span>

A quick diagram of Kick Ass would work something like this: an unclever premise (what if superheroes were real?) presented as a brilliant counterfactual (they would regularly get their asses kicked! in extremely graphic ways! by amoral people!) whose logic would be violated at the first opportunity (superheroes do exist!) to &quot;cleverly&quot; twist the narrative (but they're sympathetic 10-year-old girls who like to say the word &quot;cunt&quot;!) with no regard for the logical (supereheroes can't exist! but they do!) or moral (Hit Girl is a sympathetic sociopath!) consequences such a twist entails As I've already discussed his fascination with the word &quot;cunt&quot; and he's since named his magazine after the old printing pun so I think it goes without saying that Hit Girl is Millar indulging in a spot of gender-bending narcissism with pedophiliac overtones and, as such, is telling me things about himself I frankly don't want to know. Think about it: Big Daddy and Hit Girl are clearly variations of Batman and Robin, itself a relationship of questionable provenance, only Millar turns the 10-year-old proxy for Robin in a female version of an idealized vision of himself. How is that not disturbing? But I digress: His premise is that superheroes can't exist in a world constructed with something resembling a realist ethos, and in order to prove this he has John Romita, Jr. draw the reason why with unflinching brutality. (This is because at our current historical moment, &quot;realism&quot; functions as a synonym for &quot;gritty,&quot; but you already knew that.) For example: In the real world, panels like this argue, a superhero would be stabbed and then hit by a car and then all the blood in his body would fly from his wounds like so many kicked-in teeth. Such panels claim to be realist but are, in fact, hyper-stylized indulgences in violent juvenile fantasies ... which also happens to be a fairly accurate assessment of the entire book. All that said, you might be surprised to learn that I actually liked the film. Why? Compare the above to its on-screen equivalent: Notice a difference? The first and most obvious one is that the amount of blood on the pavement approximates the amount someone stabbed in the stomach would bleed. The second and more important difference is that Matthew Vaughn shoots the aftermath...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/11/kick-ass-millar-.html"><span><strong>How a person becomes a body</strong> Since some complained that my lack of detailed anatomical knowledge or emergency room experience undermined my larger argument in my first Kick-Ass post, I thought I'd approach the same argument from another angle. If you'll recall, in that post I argued that Vaughn's shot selection is essentially critical of Millar and Romita, Jr.'s excessive lust for representing broken human bodies. To put it another way: in Millar and Romita's book, the characters aren't people so much as bodies to broken; whereas in Vaughn's film, the characters are sympathetic people with lives to be invested in. This dynamic, it turns out, also exists in scenes that don't involve the quantity of blood that a body can realistically bleed out. Consider the scene in which the titular hero, Dave Lizewski, teases the audience with a typical origin story: In the first panel, the dead mother is a headless body sprawled on the floor. The high angle of framing only allows for the reader to register the shock of her death via Lizewski's body language, as his face is so distant that the only visible emotional marker is his oblong, half-opened mouth. That's not a shot that's liable to build sympathy for a character; in point of fact, the almost omniscient perspective in the panel creates a sense of the narrator's distance from the events being narrated (despite said events being the death of his mother). The second panel transposes the reader from the reality (however coldly rendered) of a mother's death to the decidedly unreal world of superhero origin stories. Again, the distance of the reader from Lizewski places the emphasis on his body; his face is an open howl, but his vengence (such that it is) is communicated through the Liefeldian posturing. (I have a strong memory of Sunspot frequently being in an identical posture during Liefeld's run on New Mutants, but Google's being unforthcoming.) All of which is only to say that, in the book, grief is demonstrated not through facial expressions that might lead readers to sympathize with Lizewski, but with exaggerated postures that render him less of a person than a trope. Compare that to the same scene in the film. It opens with an establishing medium shot of the family at breakfast: Then zooms to the right and into a medium close-up of the dead mother: For narrative reasons the cereal occupies the center of the screen, but it also divides the scene between the mother's head and Lizewski's reaction to it falling to the table. His face is visible; his reaction is measurable. The woman at the table is not a headless anonymous thing called &quot;Mother,&quot; but a woman who once was, but is no longer, a presence in a life. The camera then pans up into the next shot, which mirrors the one from the book: Before panning back down to the table: This shot is identical to the previous with the exception of the fact that the mother is missing. It then pans back...</span></a></div>
