float: right;" /></a>The only other features of our collection worth mention are Theoryland and the Science Fiction &amp; Irish Literature ghetto.&nbsp; Theoryland is stacked three rows deep.&nbsp; While I wish this were some clever commentary on &quot;the depth of the books,&quot; it's really a testament to Gigantor--the 8.32 ft. tall solid-cherry monster once home to an ornamental law library but purchased for $80 in a secondhand shop--and his marketing prowess.&nbsp; All the books want to live on Gigantor.&nbsp;

float: left;" /></a>The sublime materiality of a 318 lbs. bookshelf in an apartment almost exclusively festooned with particle-board attracts all the best books.&nbsp; They know that social mobility flows both ways.&nbsp; On Monday you're right where you want to be, sandwiched between Derrida and Deleuze, a complete set of Durant's <em>Story of Civilization </em>above your head; on Tuesday you awake dazed in unfamiliar and unfriendly environs, comics and graphic novels to your left, Vintage reprints of Phillip K. Dick novels to your right.&nbsp; You'll wonder when it all went so terribly, terribly wrong.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>2. What books or records do you keep separate from your collection for easy access?&nbsp; </strong><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/the_desk.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=533,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="100" height="66" border="0" alt="The_desk" title="The_desk" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/the_desk.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>As I've already mentioned, the books which feed the dissertation's fires live on the bookshelf to the immediate left of my desk.&nbsp; Migrations to-and-from the desk occur with stunning regularity: I should <em>remember </em>the gist of that passage in <em>Our America</em>, the standard abbreviation for seaborgium (Sg), or what naturalism is.&nbsp; The most attractive feature of this system is that it allows me to construct bookshelves <em>out of books</em>.&nbsp; The more time they spend on my desk, the more likely they are to become a feature of it.&nbsp; The stacks of books doubling as bookends contain the material I consult with desperate abandon four or five times daily.&nbsp; This system's actually quite inconvenient.&nbsp; I have to remove all the books on top of the book I want in order to read it.&nbsp; It's the product of the monthly straightening of the material on my desk into neatly disorgnized stacks and is a terrible, terrible idea.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>3. When you take down a book for reference, how long after you finish it does it take you to reshelve it?&nbsp; </strong>I like <a href="http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2005/07/pickle-meme.html">Adam</a>'s idea: when I'm finished with a book I ought to put it back and bask in feelings of accomplishment.&nbsp; But as I haven't accomplished anything yet, and as I compulsive chech and re-check the source material for the work I've already done, reshelving isn't really an issue yet.&nbsp; But that's the dissertation talking.&nbsp; Before the books I &quot;needed&quot; to write the beast started occupying multiple rows on multiple shelves, like Adam I reshelved as I moved from project-to-project.&nbsp; Now that I don't know who I'll need off the bench from one day to the next, I prefer to keep them all handy in the aforementioned bookshelf-of-books.</p>

<p><strong>4. What resources do you keep separate from your collection because you don't want anyone to know you have it?&nbsp; </strong>There's a reason it's called the Science Fiction &amp; Irish Literature Ghetto.&nbsp; (What do you mean the Irish don't deserve it?&nbsp; <em>Of course they do</em>.)&nbsp; One day I'm sure I'll break down and sell some books.&nbsp; Undiscussed above are some shelves in a dark hallway containing the detritus of the Don Stafford collection.&nbsp; Stafford was an English professor at LSU, and when he died the used bookstore I worked at for 4 years acquired his collection.&nbsp; I'm not sure what possessed me to purchase the complete works of Samuel Tyler Coleridge, but I did.&nbsp; Now they sit on a shelf waiting to be sold.&nbsp; But unlike <a href="http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the_little_professor/2005/07/further_adventu.html">Miriam</a>, I can't bring myself to sell them.&nbsp; They're <em>books</em>.&nbsp; They're meant to be hoarded.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Now it's my turn to tag: <a href="http://hnn.us/blogs/2.html">Ralph</a> and <a href="http://ghw.wordherders.net/">Gzombie</a>, consider yourself memed.</p>

<p>Hahahaha!  Er, I mean: hold on to that thought.  It will aid in preserving your sanity over the coming decades.  It will not, however, actually happen; or rather, you will sell a drib here and a drab there as the books continue to cascade in by the shelfload, until the sig. oth. starts wondering about the load-bearing capacity of the floor you&#39;re thinking of putting a new bookcase on.</p>

The same can not be said for the loyal reader of this blog and generally interesting person who masquerades as Mr. Language Hat. You should read his blog daily because I've listed it in my blogroll, but if that's not motivation enough, I bumped into a link to his site while tracking down the &quot;Can You Raed Tihs Or Cotnempalte Taht Aynnoe Wtih Kownlegde Of Lnagauge Or Wahtont Can?&quot; meme. Read his original post on the subject and then work through a few sentences on your own. I think you'll find, as I have, that it isn't simply a matter of first and last letters, but is related to syllabic units. For example, I doubt you can parse &quot;wahtont&quot; with the same ease with which you parse &quot;raed.&quot; (Or maybe this is another example of the unusual way the deaf relate to language. I'm not sure. But the more I think about it, the more I wonder whether abandoning linguistics for purely practical reasons was a truly terrible idea.) The longer the word, the less likely you are to parse it quickly. Take, for example, that exemplar of long words antidisestablishmentarianism I'd wager that I can rearrange the word order of antidisestablishmentarianism such that it becomes impossible to parse quickly (which is the point of the study in question). In fact, I bet I can begin it with an &quot;a&quot; and conclude it with an &quot;m&quot; and stick pretty much any letters inbetween and you'll be as flumoxed as you would be if I inserted the actual letters. You probably couldn't even tell the difference. To wit: asinitareabishemnartiandtnm aartiantemenhsilbatesdistism</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/the_coarse_unde.html"><span><strong>The Coarse Underwear of Some Minds</strong> It's official: if I read another word written by Jack London, I will hunt down his great-grandchildren and make them pay for his sins by shaking my fist with force and a countenance so unsubtle even their great-grandfather would understand it. Arguments about aesthetics often boil down to nebulous notions of complexity, but I think that wrong-headed. Boiled to the bone, it really is a matter of what familiarity breeds: contempt or contemplation. But the category of contempt needs to be considered more carefully. Does it breed a contempt for a particular author or for the written word itself? Does reading and re-reading a particular author drain from you the desire to ever read anything again? Does it make you doubt the value of the printed word? To counter the &quot;London Effect&quot; I'm re-re-reading Musil's The Man Without Qualities. I've read it through twice and both times I've been struck by the intensity of the experience of reading a 2,545-page unfinished novel. After 250 pages you begin to think like the narrator. I'm all of eleven pages into my re-re-reading, but its allure's already a comforting reacquaintance. Reading about the &quot;the fine underwear of their minds,&quot; or what it's like to be &quot;irritated by the subservience of a man who was, after all, a member of the intellectual aristocracy toward the owner of horses, fields, and traditions&quot; reminds me that not all writers possess the &quot;depths&quot; of Jack London. I've been plumbing them and my forehead pounds from my results.</span></a></div>
