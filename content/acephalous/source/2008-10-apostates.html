It’s in the next sentence: Obama is an Anti-American/Pro-Jihadi/Anti-Semitic/Anti-White Rascist Marxist Muslim FACT. The commenter wrote fact in all-caps. I can see a lowly “fact” being reputed, but, by the foundational laws of typography, a “FACT’ is irrefutable. See? NRO is one of the best sources for conservative thought on planet earth, and Buckley can go fly a kite, which under [Obama] he’ll have to obtain a federal and state license to own and operate.

But this post isn’t about barrels or even The National Review. This post is about elitism and elites: hristopher Buckley and Heather MacDonald should mate, but have Michelle Obama offer to be the surrogate mother. Then Barack Obama can raise the child as if it were his own. They’ll name him John, in honor of Kerry, and in 30 years we’ll be blessed with the Perfect Snob. This post is about us and them, with them responding to the above comment thus: Typical black family. LOL. Which means this post is about the Culture Wars: I do know that we have NOT had 8 years of conservatism as [Buckley suggests]. And I know that electing an eloquent radical Marxist is not the way to advance the cause. It’s suicide. Good riddance to you, and Kristol, and McCain, and for that matter GWB. The hell with reaching across the aisle. Where has it gotten us? Until we recognize the enemy as the enemy, we will continue to be defeated. Make that the intra-conservative Culture War. To wit: Christopher Buckley is another super-rich elitist, who can afford to behave and say whatever he wants. No, I was right the first time.

<p>Make that the <em>intra-conservative</em> Culture War.&nbsp; <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/14/christopher-buckley-quits-national-review-over-obama-endorsement/comment-page-3/#comment-1526710">To wit</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Christopher Buckley is another super-rich elitist, who can afford to behave and say whatever he wants.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, I was right the first time. This is about the Culture War, only
the populists (such that they are) are throwing their intellectual
elites (such that they are) overboard because the latter are <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/14/christopher-buckley-quits-national-review-over-obama-endorsement/comment-page-3/#comment-1526731">too centrist</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Look on the bright side[:] since McCain has failed to
pick up the vaunted [independents] and moderates, perhaps no one else
will be so hasty to try this strategy in the near future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why would they?&nbsp; <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/14/christopher-buckley-quits-national-review-over-obama-endorsement/comment-page-3/#comment-1526761">After all</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is binary. A or B.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is why, in the post to which all these people are responding
(as well as conservative sites in general these days) “nuance” is used
as a term of opprobrium:</p>
<blockquote><p>The gratuitous sneer about ideological diversity, as if
The Nation or Salon was any better, makes me think his political
leanings are a tad more <em>nuanced</em> than he’s letting on, but if that’s the case then he probably shouldn’t have been given a column to begin with.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because you can’t have nuance when everyone’s asked to pass “the litmus test.”</p>

So I avoided these duties today by defending what I’d written yesterday from this. I don’t know what to make of that—the anger spills from, well, I’m not sure—but in the end, I’m blamed for present hate-mail from Atlantic readers and future hate-mail from American Conservative readers. All because I considered Jeff Goldstein’s “disinterested” disquisition on the relationship of ghostwriters to their subjects insufficiently disinterested, what with it being a series of hypotheticals about Bill Ayers ghostwriting Barack Obama’s autobiographies and all. Why would I think Goldstein’s interests weren’t disinterested? Probably because he’s been postulating this here and that there about Ayers’ relation to Obama’s relation to Alinksy’s relation to the New Left and all things radical. Admittedly, in the post I linked to—the disinterested “What If…?” about Ayers ghostwriting Obama’s memoirs—Jeff didn’t speak directly to his beliefs about Obama and the totalitarian state his victory will usher in. He spoke entirely hypothetically and disinterestedly about the sort of material James Olney wrote brilliantly about in Memory &amp; Narrative—a book I can’t recommend highly enough, for what it lacks in the faux-theoretical sophistication of insecure blowhards it makes up with genuine, old-school erudition—except unlike Olney, whose impetus was either Beckett or St. Augustine, Jeff felt compelled to share his wholly and entirely disinterested thoughts about life-writing after reading Cashill’s hackneyed “analysis” of Ayers and Obama’s memoirs. What was I thinking, connecting what he’d been writing to months to his totally disinterested post about life-writing that just so happened to feature the same two figures who star in his drama of inevitable American decline? I’m such a liar . . . but if you can bear with me for a moment, there’s a more important topic at stake here. Jeff’s commenters have sunk to a new low: Now they’re claiming UCI is a community college. They’re making fun of the institution that made me a Doctor of Philosophy of Literature, and I won’t stand for it. I’m this close to blowing all my gaskets and— —what’s that you say? UCI isn’t the armpit of the UC system? Davis is? I suppose my gaskets are safe then. I can’t imagine anyone here taking offense to that. *Via Insult incarnate.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/10/the-enduring-im.html"><span><strong>The enduring image of the 2008 Presidential campaign</strong> (x-posted.) Via Warren Ellis (whose realist* riff on Batman I taught last week): If ever a photo called out for a caption, this one does. UPDATE: It's a little long for a caption, but I do believe AWB allegorizes the moment to perfection: The whole situation is emblematic of his campaign. He's smug and overconfident sitting on his side of the desk, but Obama makes a move to the left and he unconsciously follows it, until he realizes it makes him look like a follower, at which point he does something hideous and shocking before heading as far to the right as possible. *By which I mean, I asked the students to discuss whether Ellis's take was more or less realistic than the genre-driven cycle of incarceration Umberto Eco described here [JSTOR].</span></a></div>
