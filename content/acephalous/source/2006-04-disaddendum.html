<p>Michael, first, that&#39;s the best literary theory joke about working at Infocom I&#39;ve ever stumbled across, and second:</p>

<p><i>You are in a big room full of people listening to Phil Collins.</p>

<p>&gt; kill self</p>

<p>You are on a big cloud surrounded by people listening to Phil Collins.</p>

<p>&gt; request transfer</p>

<p>You are in a fiery lake.  A hellspawn speared your balls and cut out your tongue.  Over the screams of the damned you hear a faint Muzak version of &quot;Take Me Home.&quot;  </p>

<p>&gt; tade be hobe</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand that.</p>

<p>&gt; TADE BE HOBE</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand that.</p>

<p>&gt; PLEADE?</p>

<p>Please what?  &#39;Cuz I don&#39;t remember.</i></p></span>
