I think he does believe in the unconscious, even if he doesn't realize it (and especially if the latter is true, how much the better evidence for the unconscious itself?). I believe this to be true because The Best Quotation in the History of Everything means little if the quote doesn't carry more weight in its very presence than it carries in its proportionality to the rest of S. Weir Mitchell's writing. Such is the acuteness of Laura's question: &quot;If you have read through reams &amp; reams of this writer and only found this one remark that fits your profile, isn't that kind of a slender peg?&quot; Well, of course it's not a slender peg, but only because its presence (singular though it seems) reveals that Mitchell was preoccupied by Lamarck, which is a way of saying that unconsciously Lamarck was &quot;in Mitchell's head.&quot; This is one of the significances of &quot;The Writer's Mark&quot;. Laura's question did flummox me. (So much so I tried and failed to answer it twice. Since the third time is by definition the charm, this will be my definitive answer. Unless it isn't.) But Mitchell'd articulated an opinion in absolute concord with the structure of thought whose existence I take inductive pains to document in my chapter. To see expressed in plain English undeniable proof of what I had I reasoned from Mitchell's not unsubstantial corpus brought joy to my heart and bounce to my step. Why? Here is where Rodney intervenes. He claims that what I found amounts to Mitchell's unconscious adoption of Lamarckian thought. A fine asseveration, that is, but not quite correct. Mitchell was not &quot;unconscious&quot; of his Lamarckian influence in the psychoanalytic sense. He was &quot;unconscious&quot; of them in the same way many literary critics are &quot;unconscious&quot; of the influence of Copernicus on their astronomical thought: it is unacknowledged—perhaps even unacknowledgeable—not unconscious. An unacknowledged intellectual debt which takes the form of a cultural assumption differs from an unconscious belief in that it isn't unconscious so much as unthought. It lives beneath the bayous of cultural literacy. In the thick muck among the crawdads and the nutria. Anyone who wants to find it can . . . only most choose not to. In this case most have chosen not to. &quot;Social Darwinism&quot; suffices for them. Because they want it to it so desperately . . . . . . so desperately they'll see it even if it ain't there. And it ain't. Don't believe me? Buy my dissertation. From me. It'll cost you a little less than a hybrid. But imagine the pain you'll be saving me. You can't count that in dollars. Only I can.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/last_night_the_.html"><span><strong>A Xenobiological Romance, Part II</strong> Tuesday night the Little Womedievalist and I celebrated the end of Winter Quarter by rewatching War of the Worlds . Of course it's not the best film out there, but it enabled us to mock thetans mercilessly. (Let me tell you: we need the enabling.) The film, we thought, would be exactly the sort of thing we needed to establish a sound boundary between the Winter quarter which ended on Monday and the Spring quarter which begins on . . . Monday. Can you smell the panic in the air? Because I'm emenating it as I once &quot;emenated&quot; sweat at baseball clinics held on astroturf in humid Louisiana summers. (By &quot;humid&quot; I mean &quot;precipitationish days in which the periwinkle sky contained nary a puff of cloud yet made one feel end-of-a-marathon wet the moment one stepped from air conditioned bliss.&quot;) Check below the fold for my initial reaction to the film. (Far fewer of you read me then. I was but a babe.) While lacking historicist oomph of my typical diatribe, it still bears some relation to yesterday's objections. (I remember wanting to edit some grammatical infelicity from it earlier. Only I can't find it now. First person to point it out wins Recognition For Being the First Person to Point It Out . . . and a yellow ribbon.) The usual caveat attached to things I wrote before yesterday applies here: If I say anything stupid it's only because I wasn't that bright and haven't read widely enough yet. All of which is only to say that my new theories about the film and novel will be expounded upon in the comments tomorrow. I can't see to put two sentences which aren't about S.W. Mitchell together tonight. It's a personal failing. I understand. _____________________ 18 July 2005 A chunk of narration near the end of Wells' War of the Worlds has always bothered me. That same chunk of narration in Spielberg's War of the Worlds bothers me even more. I haven't read Wells in years, but as I started working the influence of evolutionary theory ca. 1890-1910, I realized I'd have to account for War of the Worlds. After all, it's one of the few novels in which evolution qua evolution wins. Pure and simple: the best laid plans of man and alien fall before the unremitting logic of Darwinian adaptation. That's why the inclusion of this passage--in the form of a voice-over by Morgan Freeman--seems so, dare I say, conciliatory: And scattered about it, some in their overturned war-machines, some in the now rigid handling-machines, and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a row, were the Martians--dead!--slain by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems were unprepared; slain as the red weed was being slain; slain, after all man's devices had failed, by the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth. Spielberg, founding member of the Actual Jewish Media Conspiracy (a.k.a. Dreamworks), kowtows to an increasingly Christian...</span></a></div>
