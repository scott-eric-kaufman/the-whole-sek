Fawcett went on to noir novels and Popular Mechanics. </p>

<p>Sorry, I couldn&#39;t resist that, but while your first five bullets are hard to argue with, the Eisner one is much more contentious (Osamu Tezuka might want a word with you, unless you&#39;re comfortable implying that &quot;ever&quot; = &quot;in the United States&quot;). He doesn&#39;t slot into the superhero tradition very smoothly, and, let&#39;s face it, as great as The Spirit can be, it&#39;s tainted by the presence of Ebony.</p></span>

<p>My views on this are complicated — I’m an historian, so my views on everything are complicated — but as a Jew I can certainly say that the only time I truly felt “White” in that sense was in Asia.

Jewish comics artists and writers, by contrast, did their creative work in mass-market publications, rather in, say, Yiddish language newspapers.</p></span>

<p>2. Building on JPool&#39;s comment, not writing in Yiddish is the least of it. When you create heroes who grow up with the Kent family in Smallville, and blond guys named Steve Rogers who turn into Captain America, and old-money aristocrats named Bruce Wayne, it takes some real chutzpah to turn around and complain that the goyim are stealing your comics.</p></span>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have used the term &quot;stealing&quot; the way Scott did, for precisely the same reasons that JPool describes. I&#39;d describe it as a form of historical erasure, obscuring the ethnic origins of the art form in order to market it, and thus enabling non-ethnic artists (Elvis, Stan Lee) to reap the greater rewards.</p></span>

<p>Also, you don&#39;t get many crackers around these parts. Elvis wasn&#39;t just &quot;white folks.&quot; He and his fellows were white <i>trash</i>. Down-home racist populists attacked him for putting tainted music on the airwaves complete with credits to black songwriters, and present-day <a href="http://www.pseudopodium.org/ht-20030112.html#2003-01-12" rel="nofollow">ignorant dissers</a> attack him for &quot;theft,&quot; but Yankees of his own time were happy to attack him for being a redneck simpleton. Such obnoxious boundary-crossing is, of course, commonly associated with meddling by outside Jewish agitators, but in this story they didn&#39;t show up until Leiber-and-Stoller were roped in (and then chased off again).<br />

<p>He did, but that doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t bear repeating.  (Plus, I read that book on a plane and barely remember it.)</p>

<p><em> He doesn&#39;t slot into the superhero tradition very smoothly, and, let&#39;s face it, as great as The Spirit can be, it&#39;s tainted by the presence of Ebony.</em></p>

<p>I was just being hyperbolic with the &quot;ever&quot; there: Eisner&#39;s the most prominent forgotten innovator of the medium (remembered for the award, but unfamiliar to the majority of comic readers), so I was overstating the case.  That said, yes, Ebony; and so to his replacement, <a href="http://www.comics.org/issue/213129/#500381" rel="nofollow">Blubber the Eskimo</a>.</p>

<p><em>In many cases, I think twas Jew(ish person)s who stole superheroes from other Jew(ish person)s.</em></p>

<p>Let me just say: Rob, that&#39;s a fantastic post.</p>

<p><em>Jewish comics artists and writers, by contrast, did their creative work in mass-market publications, rather in, say, Yiddish language newspapers.</em></p>

<p>Obviously, you&#39;re right about the second half of that statement, and the analogy falls a little flat because of it.  That said, I meant it more in the sense of an invasion: just as Elvis brought an African-American sensibility into lily-white American households, comics brought a Jewish sensibility into them.  Of course, what with radio and the movies, there was already plenty of that, which is why Elvis&#39;s contribution was more significant (though not so significant that, as some have argued, there wouldn&#39;t have been a Civil Rights Movement without him).</p>

<p><em>When you create heroes who grow up with the Kent family in Smallville</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s not what <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG02/yeung/actioncomics/page1.html" rel="nofollow">originally happened</a>, though; moreover, even when the Clarks adopt this brown-haired, brown-eyed foreigner, there&#39;s still a sense in which his outsiderness is of an immigrant quality.  (As opposed to, say, Bruce Wayne&#39;s constitutional churlishness.)</p>

<p><em>I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have used the term &quot;stealing&quot; the way Scott did, for precisely the same reasons that JPool describes.</em></p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t really say &quot;stealing&quot; either, hence the long footnote.  I was simply riffing on the common complaint about Elvis, Eminem, etc.  </p>

<p><em>I can answer this: according to Ivory, Jewish people are &quot;White&quot; &quot;technically.&quot;</em></p>

<p>I can&#39;t read through the irony there, Ray: they&#39;re not white, they&#39;re &quot;white,&quot; but they&#39;re not really &quot;white,&quot; and they&#39;re not technically &quot;white,&quot; they&#39;re &quot;technically&quot; &quot;white.&quot;  Wait---never you mind, I see what you&#39;re saying now.</p></span>

<p>The highlight of that issue&#39;s tribute to bigotry, though, had to be the newsletter of &quot;Americans United to Beat the Dutch,&quot; which beautifully caught the look of white American supremacist rags (I know, because my high school library had a subscription to one) with some great meta-gags. After all these decades, its Dutch jokes still stick with me:</p>

<p>Moe: &quot;There are some Dutch cheeses on that plate.&quot;<br />
Joe: &quot;Gouda?&quot;<br />
Moe: &quot;Are you kidding?&quot;</p>

<p>Mack: &quot;There are some Dutch cheeses on that plate.&quot;<br />

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01310fa2ddea970c-content"><p>I thought of this post last night when I was reading Joe Glazer&#39;s description of how &quot;We Will Overcome&quot; went from being a song of the (mostly white) textile union workers to the anthem of the Civil Rights movement. </p>

<p>The short answer is that he doesn&#39;t know, exactly, but the chronology looks something like this. He, a child of Eastern European Jewish immigrants to NYC, was working for the Textile Workers Union in the late 40s and adapting a variety of traditional songs for use as union songs (for example &quot;We Shall Not Be Moved&quot; derived from a hymn &quot;I Shall Not Be Moved.&quot;). He learned &quot;We Will Overcome&quot; from a friend who learned it from the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee. She had learned the song from several black workers who were attending the school. </p>

<p>Glazer taught the song to various union groups all over the South and ended up making the first recording of the song in 1950. Around the same time Pete Seeger learned the song from the music directory at Highlander Folk School and changed &quot;We Will Overcome&quot; to &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; which he thought sounded better. </p>

<p>Then in 1959 Guy Carawan (another white sociologist and folksinger) worked at the Highlander Folk School and then ended up traveling around the south working with the emerging civil rights movement. Glazer thinks that Carawan was important in spreading the song, but certainly wasn&#39;t responsible for it&#39;s popularity which he thinks is due to some mysterious combination of qualities of the song and circumstances.</p>

<p>But, it&#39;s interesting to note the various twists and turns in how the song ended up being what one of the speakers on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sing-Freedom-Rights-Movement-Through/dp/B000001DHL/ref=pd_bxgy_m_img_b" rel="nofollow">Sing For Freedom</a> (sorry, I don&#39;t remember which one) called, our gift to people in struggle all over the world.</p>

<p>The two things that struck me about that story were, first, that the question of who steals from who can get complicated quickly and, secondly, that the world of folk music in the early 50s was a small world. It&#39;s interesting that all three of Seeger, Glazer, and Carawan learned the song from connection to a small school in the Cumberland mountains, rather than from other singers or recordings.</p></span>

Finished. Kaput. Over. Now, what should I do when I'm in England next month?</strong> So ends another maddening iteration of William Rainey Harper's infernal experiment writ large (except for all the office hours I'll hold next week and however many days it takes me to honestly assess my performance this quarter and grade their final papers equitably), and I'm so exhausted I can't even muster brains enough to translate time zones and purchase tickets to England, where I'll be headed in April to attend this conference. I'll be spending a week in England, and plan on spending time with friends I haven't seen in some time and some I've never met, but what else should I do and see while I'm there? What's essential to the non-tourist experience of London and how much of it can I cram into the four days I won't be attending the conference? (And if you happen to live there and feel like risking hosting a stranger to whom random and terrible things frequently occur, drop me a line.) On a completely unrelated note, there's a new album by the National on the horizon, and I'm giddy as a Jew-child is annoyed on Christmas morning:</span></a></div>
