Did you consider the possibility that Palin&#39;s handlers simply don&#39;t believe in staging photographs to conform to the identity politics mindset that any arbitrary person needs to be able to look at an image and &quot;see someone who looks like me&quot;..?  Perhaps instead of ascribing a racist motivation to their choice of event phototgraphs to distribute, maybe they just don&#39;t consider such things.  I mean, she might actually believe, as most conservatives I know do, in a color-blind society; one like Dr. King spoke of in the early 60&#39;s.</p>

<p>Just because conservatives consider the philosophy of identity politics divisive, just as multi-culturalism dilutes the strength of the national kinship between Americans, doesn&#39;t mean that they embrace racism or endorse a segregation of any sort.  Just as the liberals don&#39;t repudiate the support of the Jeremiah Wrights, Lewis Farrakhans, Jesse Jacksons, and Al Sharptons of the nation-and are not considered advocates of reverse racism by association with these people, neither should conservatives be impugned as &quot;institutional racists&quot; based on the behavior of some who would call themselves conservatives.</p>

<p>Perhaps when Palin talks of &quot;real Americans&quot;, she&#39;s not speaking in racial code words.  Maybe she&#39;s alluding to folks who embrace a strong feeling of nationalism and pride in this country as it is-and needn&#39;t wait for it to change into one outcomes are guaranteed instead of opportunity.  And while I realize that this message has a rubish, provincial tone to sophisticated globalists who believe we need to have a society that is more akin to the Euro-zone, or even advocate one world government; I would point out that there is nothing inherently evil, racist, arrogant, or even concieted in believeing that the reverse is true, and that their societies should operate more like our own.</p>

<p>As wth the UN, most conservatives would respect their pronouncements if they were comprised of free and open democratic societies like our own, instead of treating as equivalents, morally and functionally, two bit dictators and other tyrannical governments.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more about recognizing American exceptionalism than racism; exceptionalism that&#39;s due to the enlightened and most free system we enjoy here, governance of and by the people, and not simply based on our ethnic or geographic specifics.</p>

<p>All the best.</p></span>

<blockquote>Did you consider the possibility that Palin&#39;s handlers simply don&#39;t believe in staging photographs to conform to the identity politics mindset that any arbitrary person needs to be able to look at an image and &quot;see someone who looks like me&quot;</blockquote>

<p>If it&#39;s true, as someone on MSNBC <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/11/william-a-jacobson-likes-making-my-points-for-me.html" rel="nofollow">claimed</a>, that there are &quot;a lot of people from different races&quot; at those events, then you look at the picture in this post, the only conclusion you could draw was that the photograph was staged <em>to exclude all those non-white people</em>.  Do I think she and her people did that?  Of course not.  Do I believe that many politicians want to appear to appeal to a broad base, and therefore include a representative sampling of American diversity at their events?  Absolutely.  Is it beyond obvious that Palin and her people are doing no such thing?  </p>

<p>I think it is, and I think they&#39;re doing it on purpose.  Not necessarily because they&#39;re racist, but because they know who their core constituency is and post pictures designed to appeal to them.</p>

<blockquote>Perhaps when Palin talks of &quot;real Americans&quot;, she&#39;s not speaking in racial code words.</blockquote>

<p>Maybe not, but given when and where she said it, she&#39;s revealing who she believes &quot;real Americans&quot; to be.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a6e415ca970b-content"><p>It should be duly noted that gentleman Bob Reed is, in my opinion, a racist.  Furthermore, Bob&#39;s denials of his racist extremist stripes are as thin and used as toilet paper in Fort Bragg&#39;s busiest latrine.</p>

<p>One should take into account the fierce guiltless ignorance of a Bob Reed type.  It&#39;s for his racist devotion that there exists affirmative action, which, ironically, he feels is unconstitutional, though the Supreme Court has upheld its constitutionality time and again.  And that&#39;s the big rub of it all, smack a guy like Bob in the head and you get soap bubbles, yet he lectures the world of MLK and the Constitution.  The man is simply fully and completely self-unaware. </p>

<p>If you run across a right-wing racist blog, Stacy McCain&#39;s for example, you can likely count on Bob being there to defend the odious coward&#39;s words, as if he&#39;s a simple spectator in the crowd who wears a slightly amused smirk as he gazes upon a black man swinging from a noose.  But they, in the crowd, didn&#39;t themselves hang the Negro, don&#39;t blame them, or so goes the Southern gentleman&#39;s typical guilt aversion-inspired alibi. </p>

<p>He won&#39;t the one doing the noosin&#39;, ain&#39;t no racist neither! </p>
