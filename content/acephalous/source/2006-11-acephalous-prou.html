[Voyeur! — The Management] For the past week I've been cribbing lectures notes from your discussion of Keats because I knew I was teaching it this Monday. To make a long story short, at the University of [Anonymous Readers], we have to do these weekly writing assignments in introductory courses like the one I'm teaching. This week mine was about Keats. Imagine my surprise when I found these sentences in student's response: Since it can't speak for itself, the speaker must impute meaning to the urn.

Eventually he said a friend of his sent some comments to him that he thought were so smart he kept them in his paper. He wanted to know whether acknowledging his friend's help in the next paper would get him off the hook. I told him he would be fine so long as he admitted where he got those sentences from. Finally he confessed that his fraternity brothers told him that if they use Google Blog Search to find ideas, no one will ever find out because they don't include those results on Google or Turnitin.com. Which means you're empowering plagiarists everywhere! I love you, Scott, but you are now officially part of the problem. With the permission of its author, I forwarded this to a friend of mine. He said: Admit it, you're like one of those porn stars who loves the thought of all those guys getting busy on their bad selves. The only question is, what do you say when the camera stops rolling? Do you turn the cameraman and complain that $400 isn't worth all the shit you have to put up with. I have absolutely no idea what he's talking about. Not that I'm changing the subject—even though I am and at twice the speed of type no less—but the nice young lady who sent the original email loved the thought of my publishing it (and my friend's response) here.
