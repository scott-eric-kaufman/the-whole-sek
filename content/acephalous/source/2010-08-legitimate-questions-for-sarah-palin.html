			<p>Sarah Palin’s latest inane statement, “<a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?saved&amp;&amp;note_id=418811008434&amp;id=24718773587">Legitimate Questions for the President</a>,”  may be inane, but it demonstrates quite nicely how those on the left  lost the rhetorical battle concerning what she calls “this Ground Zero  mosque.”  As Eric Rauchway <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2010/08/09/political-geography/">pointed out</a>,  Manhattan Island is a small place—only about 13 miles long and 2.3  wide—that looms larger in our collective imagination because of its  social and cultural importance.  If you asked Palin or any of the others  who have temporarily abandoned their disdain for all things East Coast  and elitist whether it would be acceptable if someone built a mosque within  a 1.5 mile radius of where the Twin Towers once stood, they would  likely continue protesting <em>because they are utterly ignorant of the fact  that that roughly eliminates <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=6+World+Trade+Center,+New+York,+NY&amp;daddr=40+Washington+Square+S,+New+York,+10012+%28NYU+School+of+Law%29&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FbcubQIdnKOW-yF_mkz-JACefCknrSKfEFrCiTFuEvV2DYF6YA%3BCaqnZDQLq5bSFap_bQIdhtuW-yHA1cLjBzVz6Cl5g5GgkVnCiTGPMokStbbRfw&amp;mra=pd&amp;mrcr=0&amp;sll=40.720176,-74.006638&amp;sspn=0.049634,0.051241&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.721079,-73.996096&amp;spn=0.024817,0.02562&amp;t=h&amp;z=15">everything south of NYU</a></em>.*</p>
<p>To their minds, New York City is less of a <em>teeming</em> than an <em>endless</em> metropolis, one that begins on the southern tip of the island and extends  beyond the horizons to the north and east and west.  They fail to  recognize that there was a reason New Yorkers stopped building out and  started building up—there is only so much room on an island 22 square  miles in area—and so they assume that renovating a Men’s Wearhouse into a  community center must, perforce, be an insult to the memories of the  victims of 9/11.  Their reaction to learning that the mosque being built  on Ground Zero is actually a community center being built two blocks  away is a stubborn spectacle couched in deliberately deceptive language.</p>
<p>Palin’s rhetorical transformation of “the mosque being built on  Ground Zero” into “this Ground Zero mosque” would be brilliant if  intentional.  It draws a scar across an infinite island and declares  everything to its south to be sacred American soil.  The area she calls  “Ground Zero” is a fictional place in whose name she and her ideological  brethren can express their xenophobia without fear of being called  xenophobic.  She and they can claim to support the good Muslims—the ones  who know that their place, literally, is not in lower Manhattan—safe in  the knowledge that, with a wink, their fear of people with strange  names from foreign lands can arguably be something other than it is. In her mind and theirs, “this Ground Zero mosque” is less of a  building than a psychological representation of the controversy caused  by their ignorance of the island’s geography, <em>i.e.</em> they have retooled their own stupidity into a potent rhetorical feint whose truth is undeniable <em>because it refers to the debate about an imaginary building on an infinitely large island</em>.   For Palin and those like her, the “Ground Zero” in “this Ground Zero  mosque” functions not as a reference to the former site of the Twin  Towers, but as a simple adjective that identifies the particular  “mosque” in question.</p>
<p>That it happens not to be located on Ground Zero is, at this point in the conversation, irrelevant.</p>
<p>Palin proves this by obfuscation.  Her concern about “this Ground  Zero mosque” is not that it will be located on Ground Zero, but “steps  away from” it.  Twice in her short post she uses the phrase “steps away  from” to describe the distance of “this Ground Zero mosque” from Ground  Zero.  Part of me wants to chide her with a simple reminder that,  despite being in Southern California, I am “steps away from” her front  door in Wasilla, Alaska.  Granted, I’m many millions of steps away from  it, but steps away nonetheless.  Another part, however, wants to ask her  to define her terms.  How many “steps away from” something she  considers “hallowed ground” must American citizens of Islamic faith  be required to take before they can enjoy their constitutionally  guaranteed right to religious freedom?  How many “steps away from” must they  be before they can exercise their constitutionally guaranteed right to  assemble freely?</p>
<p>I have a feeling that waiting for specific answers will be a fruitless waste.</p>
<p>*I write “roughly” because superimposing a circle on a grid and describing the results hurts my head.</p>

But in Lower Manhattan, even in Brooklyn, it&#39;s a ways away. Even 3 or 4 blocks is a distance encompassing probably the entire population of Wasilia. </p>

<p>In other words, duh, Palin&#39;s a rube who knows nothing about NYC and who also doesn&#39;t understand that distance, particularly in the symbolic sense in which she&#39;s deploying it, is anything but quantitative. </p></span>

<p>And completely independent of the First Amendment issues, all the talk about &quot;hallowed ground&quot; seems to me to be utterly misguided, as it proves way too much.  <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/scocca/archive/tags/Auschwitz/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">Slate</a> had an article about this today; the relevant segment is part of the author&#39;s punchline:<blockquote><br />
Get rid of the Islamic center and the alternative will not be a memorial park, but a fitness center, an American Apparel, a Pinkberry. Dignity makes a lousy standard for downtown zoning.<br />
</blockquote><br />
I, for one, would rather have a building in that location which is dedicated to educating or otherwise improving the lives of those nearby, rather than an edifice designed to worship the Almighty Dollar. But in any case, the most important thing is that its use is not up to me, nor to anyone else who doesn&#39;t own that space.</p></span>

<p>It is intentional.  Or really, what makes you think it isn&#39;t?</p>

<p>Your post is full of statements like &quot;In her mind and theirs&quot; which elide the obvious: she&#39;s a liar and a demagogue, and makes her living from playing up race hatred.  I&#39;d guess that everyone in the GOP commentariat knows the obvious facts about the mosque, or at least doesn&#39;t care and wouldn&#39;t be surprised by them.  I&#39;d guess that most of the people repeating the lie really know the facts too.  But it&#39;s more enjoyable for them to try to gin up a lynching.  They&#39;re evil.</p></span>

A dilution of that argument (the one I think you&#39;re offering, though you&#39;re so vague that I cannot be sure) is &quot;Well I don&#39;t have a problem with the mosque, but some people do, so don&#39;t build it.&quot;</p>

<p>You failed to define &quot;considering other people&#39;s sensibilities.&quot;  For example, civil rights protestors considered white people&#39;s sensibilities, and then marched and did sit-ins at segregated restaurants anyway.  Consideration does not equal obedience.  </p>

<p>The burden is on you to prove that the Cordoba House should not be at its proposed location.</p></span>

The thing is, nothing in our system of laws precludes people from being offended by the religious expressions of others--in fact, making people offended in this way is Constitutionally protected on many levels (just ask Fred Phelps).</em></p>

<p>Yes, but those laws only protect the right of (possibly/potentially radical) Muslims to build their sanctuary of sin there, that doesn&#39;t mean they ought to do it.  Isn&#39;t there some nice land in [<em>insert somewhere rural and preposterous</em>] that they could use instead?  After all, the needs of the non-existent Muslim community in [<em>somewhere rural and preposterous</em>] outweigh the needs of the actual, extant Muslim community in lower Manhattan.  </p>

<p>In other words, Kyler, I&#39;m with you on this one.</p>

<p><em>It is intentional. Or really, what makes you think it isn&#39;t?</em></p>

<p>Because the move to create outrage over a fictional building on a fictional section of an unimaginably large island is too rhetorically sophisticated for the likes of her to intentionally create.  She accidentally did so while walking away from the claim that a mosque would be built in the Freedom Tower&#39;s stead, saw that &quot;this Ground Zero mosque&quot; resonated with people who knew no better, and stuck with it.</p>

<p><em>As a one-time resident of the Bronx, I have to insist that you&#39;re going wrong when you equate New York with Manhattan. Those people sweeping up ash in Brooklyn were victims too. That&#39;s how terrorism works; the particular killing is a bonus.</em></p>

<p>As a one-time resident of Brooklyn, I&#39;m inclined to agree ... but I wasn&#39;t talking about the city of New York so much as &quot;New York City&quot; as it exists in the minds of people who&#39;ve never been there, who know it only through <em>Law &amp; Order</em> and <em>Sex and the City</em>, <em>i.e.</em> for whom Manhattan <em>is</em> New York City.  I mean, honestly, you don&#39;t think when someone in Iowa thinks of New York City that they picture Queens, do you?</p>

<p><em>Would it be sensible?</em></p>

<p>Many things people do with their constitutionally guaranteed rights aren&#39;t sensible, and to my mind, purchasing a building and using it to worship a god that doesn&#39;t exist strikes me as insensible whether that god be Jesus, Yahweh, or Mohammad.  Whether it&#39;s politically insensitive is another matter, but in all honesty, I think if FOX hadn&#39;t manufactured this outrage, no one would&#39;ve cared.</p></span>

<p>Throwing mud at a wall and seeing what sticks is not rhetorically sophisticated, perhaps, but it is intentional, and it leads to the same result.</p>

<p>Although I actually would disagree, possibly, about its sophistication.  Which is more efficient -- carefully calculating an elaborate rhetoric to rile up your audience, a rhetoric that may fail?  Or saying any old thing and staying with whatever works, knowing that your audience will forget about any of the things that you said that didn&#39;t work?  It&#39;s like the Mars launch of hate vs. the million seeds of hate.</p></span>

I guess. I suppose I was a victim too because I missed my Bynum seminar that morning. You see, the subways stopped running. I don&#39;t think of myself as a victim though. You want real victims? They&#39;re all over the place, including Iraq, which we attacked because PNAC decided that the 9.11 attacks were the perfect catalyst, including Pakistan, 20% of which is underwater right now, no doubt in part bc the Right has wasted billions of dollars on killing people that could have been used to combat climate change. Victims a plenty.</p>

<p>In sum: you want not to build near victims of the WTC/Pentagon attack? Don&#39;t build anywhere.</p>

<p>As a CURRENT resident of Brooklyn, and a former resident of both Manhattan and the Bronx, as someone who saw one of the towers come down while standing on his Brooklyn roof (and who, indeed, on the evening of 9.10.2001 declared the WTC an &quot;eyesore,&quot; wrecking his view), I say: let them build wherever they like. Why should it bother me? If, as people say, there can be Irish pubs in London, there can (continue) to be Muslim community centers in Lower Manhattan.<br />

Still, John Nolte’s review is a teleological marvel. What he likes about the film is the simple straight-forward plot, all the B-movie mayhem you could possibly ask for, and two unapologetic hours of masculinity—which may be two hours more than we’ve seen in all of the last decade put together. These boys smoke cigars, drink beer while piloting airplanes, and return us to those glorious pre-Oprah days when stoicism was still a virtue and real men didn’t gush about their inner-emotional lives like 13 year-old girls drunk on Dr. Pepper at a slumber party. Maybe someone should tell him that the reason flat characters don’t “gush” about “their inner-emotional lives” is because they don’t have them. Maybe I should. I suppose I will. Please, Mr. Nolte, continue: Sylverster Stallone’s glorious throwback to the brawny 80s is also about something, and it’s not Bourne-ian self-discovery. It’s about something that actually matters. And in this age of nihilism when believing in anything bigger than self is considered old-fashioned, unsophisticated and naïve, that’s both refreshing and important. If you insist on italicizing the word “about,” you might want to indicate what that “something” that it’s about actually is. Sorry, I’m being rude. Mr. Nolte, you may continue: The story opens with a well-crafted action sequence involving Somalia pirates that not only establishes how deadly competent our guys are, but also that they’re not cold-blooded killers. These are men with a moral code and one of their own breaking that code will be the root cause of deadly complications and a couple over the top action sequences to come. So these are mercenaries who only ever fight the good fight? If I may, Mr. Nolte, let me recommend my friend Adam Roberts’s post on Iron Man, in which he notes that that film adheres to the dream narrative of US military involvement in the Middle East: one American is able to go to Afghanistan, kill only the bad Afghans, leave all the good Afghani men women and children alive and leap away into the sky. That “dream narrative” isn’t the product of a moral code, but simply a denial of the reality of reality. But I should let you finish: The plot gets a nudge courtesy of a self-referential Meeting of The Titans. Ever in search of a job, Barney meets with “Church” (Bruce Willis), a CIA spook in need of some housecleaning that won’t make headlines and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a long-time rival. Cinematically this is far from a great scene— First, stop pretending to be German. Second, I think you’re starting to realize that you didn’t even like the film. You call it a “B-movie,” rate its action scenes as “over the top,” and now you’re criticizing how it films a conversation. What did you think of the dialogue? [T]hese aren’t men...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/08/someone-should-tell-john-nolte-that-tendentious-people-ought-not-call-others-tendentious.html"><span><strong>Someone should tell John Nolte that tendentious people ought not call others tendentious.</strong> Yet again, the duty falls to me. Here goes: Nolte is complaining about Steven Zeitchik’s article in the L.A. Times, in which he writes: But the Stallone picture—with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (”We will kill this American disease,” as the TV spot enticed us)—planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. According to Nolte, this amounts to Zeitchik “toxifying ‘The Expendables’ by ridiculing its simple worldview,” but Nolte fails to explain why a film should be praised for the simplicity of its worldview. The most he can muster is that “the nihilism found in the moral equivalency preached by the likes of George Clooney and Paul Haggis is [not] complicated,” which amounts to “if they can do it, we can do it.” The problem with that logic should be obvious: it’s not a defense of simplistic worldviews, it’s the claim that if I set your house on fire, you would be right to retaliate by doing the same to mine. That both positions may be weak is evidently a point beyond his ability to comprehend. Nolte then provides another non-answer, claiming that a simple straight-forward story that’s actually about something is much more difficult to successfully craft than a confusing and muddled story that’s believes in absolutely nothing. Paint-by-numbers might not be Rembrandt but it takes more skill than throwing monkey shit at a canvas. Note that he again argues that The Expendables is “about” something without ever defining what that thing is. This is the obverse of Groucho Marx’s “Whatever It Is, I’m Against It” argument, in that whatever The Expendables is about, Nolte’s in favor of it, whatever it might be. But whatever it is, it’s morally unambiguous, which means the following claim of Zeitchik is utter bunk: [u]ntil this weekend, old-school action movies—defined, for argument’s sake, as films with a slew of explosions, a shortage of moral ambiguity and a triumph of physical effects over digital ones—had seen better days. Nolte responds: [T]his is what happens when you’re in possession of a laughably biased theory in search of proof—especially when the surprise successes of “300″ and “Taken,” not to mention “Salt,” the first “Transformers,” and “Gran Torino”—make a total fool of that moral ambiguity theory. Admittedly, Nolte is an expert in all things tendentious, so he should know it when he sees it. But a brief comparison of the material between both parties’ em-dashes demonstrates who’s arguing honestly and who isn’t. Zeitchik defines “old-school action movies … as films with a slew of explosions, a shortage of moral ambiguity and a triumph of physical effects over digital ones.” Nolte responds by listing four films, but only one of them, Taken, fits Zeitchik’s definition. 300 was filmed entirely in front of a green screen; Gran Torino contains no “explosions,” much less “a slew of” them; and unless he knows something I don’t, the Transformers in Transformers...</span></a></div>
