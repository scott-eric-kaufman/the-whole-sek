<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; e asshole</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">You are in a verandah.&#0160; The subtle hum is less subtle and you can almost make out what they say about you in the room to your left.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; what they say</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">Go south and I&#39;ll let you listen in.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; s already</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">You are standing in the hallway leading to a Louis XV bedroom stuffed with Queen Anne furniture.&#0160; To your left is a gauche chinoiserie dining room.&#0160; To your right, a Renaissance ballroom. <br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; people what they say</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">They know you&#39;ve been brooding over something lately, and they must find out what it is, as it&#39;s in their interest to do so, since they always tell you what they think.&#0160; They know that if only you trust them, but as you have been so odd lately, they can&#39;t think what you&#39;ve been plotting, or whether the Lord Trevanna has divined your intentions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; um what</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">You have been withdrawn of late, so their concern is no surprise.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; who cares</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">They evidently do.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; brandish sword</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">You remove your wit from you heart-pocket and approach the women.&#0160; They cease to gossip.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; brandish sword</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">They blush under the force of your compelling wit.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">You slay them with your tongue.&#0160; Their guilt for spreading unfounded rumors weighs upon them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; what</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">Isabel addresses you—</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; who</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">Isabel.&#0160; She says that only this morning you were her supreme court of justice, but that there was no appeal from your verdict.&#0160; That not an hour ago you decided a case for her</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—against herself! And now</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—. And now the worst of it is that it&#39;s not because you&#39;ve changed. How does she know if you&#39;ve changed?&#0160; You haven&#39;t said a hundred words to her.&#0160; And yet the years must have enriched you</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—she daresays you&#39;ve doubled your capital. You&#39;ve been in the thick of life, and the metal you&#39;re made of brightens with use.&#0160; Success on some men looks like a borrowed coat, she says, but it sits on you as though it had been made to order.&#0160; She sees all this; she knows this; but she doesn&#39;t FEEL it.&#0160; She doesn&#39;t feel anything, anywhere, she is numb.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; brandish sword now</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">You say to her, why good God, we belonged to each other</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—that you won&#39;t let her go</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; let her go</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—that you&#39;ve fought for things since that weren&#39;t worth a crooked sixpence; fought as well as other men. And she</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—she</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—you lost her because you couldn&#39;t make a scene</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—you might have survived them, as men have been known to.&#0160; They&#39;re not necessarily fatal.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; yes are kill self</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">She finds your self-deprecating display charming.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; no with sword</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">You remove a handkerchief from the breast pocket of your dinner jacket.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; where grue</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">You walk into a gilt bamboo jardiniere, in which the primulas and cinerarias are punctually renewed, and which blocks access to the bay window, where the old-fashioned would have preferred a bronze reduction of the Venus of Milo. The sofas and arm-chairs of pale brocade are cleverly grouped about little plush tables densely covered with silver toys, porcelain animals and efflorescent photograph frames, and tall rose-shaded lamps shoot up like tropical flowers among the plants.&#0160; There is no grue here, but to the right is still the Renaissance ballroom.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; fine fine go ballroom</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">You stand in the doorway, studying the petty manoeuvres of the women and the resigned amenities of their partners.&#0160; You wonder whether these were your friends, these mincing women, all paint and dye and whalebone, these apathetic men who looked as much alike as the figures that children cut out of a folded sheet of paper.&#0160; Was it to live amongst such puppets, you ask yourself, that you sold your soul?&#0160; The bald man with the globular stomach who made his pile in wrecking railroads and the political lawyer who had been mixed up to his own advantage in an ugly lobbying&#0160; transaction, whose wife was such a good manager that they kept a brougham and victoria and always put in their season at Newport and their spring trip to Europe, whose little ferret-faced youth pretends this is not a domino-party at which the guest are forbidden to unmask</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—</span></p>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/thought-in-pr-5.html"><span><strong>Thought-in-Process: Wharton's &quot;The Descent of Man,&quot; Part III</strong> (Previous installments: Part I, Part II) Further rationalizations follow: his colleagues &quot;would see the tongue in his cheek&quot; (318); since the book was already in print, he was &quot;caught ... in the toils of that mysterious engine,&quot; such that &quot;if he had had time to think the matter over, his scruples might have dragged him back; but his conscience was eased by the futility of resistance&quot; (318). His personal disavowals matter less, however, in light of the fact that he has promised not to reveal his insincerity to the public. He &quot;descends&quot; from the ranks of the professional scientist into those of the professional fraud, since he willingly peddles in pseudo-scientific nonsense for profit. It is not of the earth-shattering variety Darwin described, but a moral descent to which the title refers. But it resonates socially, too, via the crass advertising campaign Harviss orchestrates: Weeks in advance the great commander had begun to form his lines of attack. Allusions to the remarkable significance of the coming work had appeared first in the scientific and literary reviews, spreading thence to the supplements of the daily journals. Not a moment passed without a quickening touch to the public consciousness: seventy millions of people were forced to remember at least once a day that Professor Linyard's book was on the verge of appearing. Slips emblazoned with the question: Have you read &quot;The Vital Thing&quot;? fell from the pages of popular novels and whitened the floors of crowded street-cars. The query, in large lettering, assaulted the traveler at the railway bookstall, confronted him on the walls of &quot;elevated&quot; stations, and seemed, in its ascending scale, about to supplant the interrogations as to soap and stove-polish which animate our rural scenery. Given the title, the language of ascent here is telling: the newly elevated stations as one sign of debased modernity; the billboards destroying the same scenic views which initially inspired Linyard (in the indirectly roundabout way Nature does in American literature) another. To the writer of The Decoration of Houses (1897) and Italian Villas and Their Gardens (1904), these intrusions of crass modern and marketing culture into city and country alike suggest that &quot;ascent&quot; carries as much ironic heft as its obverse here. Linyard's descent is enabled by the ascent of an unaesthetic modernity, one more concerned with money than the taste with which is it spent, with moving from one place to another than the landscape traveled over. The cumulative effect of this unthinking is vitiating. Under the handling of the first reviewer, The Vital Thing's &quot;emancipated fallacies ... [were] made up admirably as truths, and their author began to understand Harviss's regret that they should be used for any less profitable purpose&quot; (319). The first reviewer &quot;set the pace,&quot; the others followed, &quot;finding it easier to let their critical man-of-all-work play a variation on the first reviewer's theme than to secure an expert to 'do' the book afresh&quot; (319). In a culture in which thinking what everyone else thinks matters more than...</span></a></div>

Many of the emails I receive are tragically misguided, like the men unsuccessfully shopping his book on how to get published. Others are plain tragic, like the women who write &quot;I have been writing this novel of my autobiographical experiences with ovarian, breast, brain and left-leg cancer, and I have two daughters who will need its proceeds when I die, &amp;c.&quot; I only mock because the two times I've Googled the names and/or email addresses of these folk I found them happy and hale in many a online forum. Today I received a pitch from someone who took the trouble to prescreen his manuscript through a &quot;Critique Company.&quot; I appreciate the effort, as it saves me the trouble of having to submit his manuscript to my own Critique Company before I publish this sure-fire best-seller. How could I distrust this incisive, erudite critique: This is an amazing manuscript! Many, many readers will benefit from this material! Thank you for writing this manuscript! This will be a huge success! I do wish you luck with this endeavor! However, you will not need luck! You have an awesome manuscript, and a special gift with words! What with seriousness of thought being directly proportional to the ratio of exclamation points per sentence, only a fool would balk at the opportunity to publish an awesome manuscript written by someone with a special gift with words! They learned to appreciate this ratio sometime since 16 May! (Not that is seems to have helped matters much!) I have contacted the sender of this email and asked him for information about his Critique Company! Mine always scowls! (And without exclamation points! How stupendously unserious!)</span></a></div>
