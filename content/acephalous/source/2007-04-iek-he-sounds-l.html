<p>We all know what Zizek needs to do. Blogspot, Wordpress, TypePad -- hell, I&#39;d even friend him on LJ. Theorist, get thyself a blog.</p></span>

Showmanship aside, the Lacanian emphasis on &#39;lack&#39; rings increasingly hollow for me, as does the Lenin-celebrations, etc. In any case, I also wanted to alert you to my new blog <a href="<a" href="<a" rel="nofollow">http://zoepolitics.blogspot.com/&gt;Zoepolitics</a></a> if you feel like adding it to your blogroll, I used to do <a href="<a" href="<a" rel="nofollow">http://jasonadams.livejournal.com&gt;Immanent</a> Multiplicity</a>. </p></span>

Especially the opening bit about oblique representation. That is exactly what I would say about the film too, if somebody rolled tape with me talking. </p>

<p>In general, god, what a wonderful set of extras. You can say what you like, but, holy christ, look at least at what Cuaron is trying to do here... Would you rather have had, dunno, a Clive Owen blooper reel? </p></span>

Don&#39;t crucify me, but maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve seen him riff more than a couple of times that I knew he wasn&#39;t being elusive and indirect, but that one of his brilliant fifty-minute-long improvisations had been chopped beyond recognition?</p></span>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen the extras yet but of six people I&#39;ve heard say anything about it you are the only one to be expressing this particular opinion. That ranges from guy with high school diploma-artist to PhD holding dude. When I first read your post I did think you seemed to be expecting an academic, nay, a peer-reviewed, rigorous, and scholarly piece of work, which seem to be a little much for a DVD extra.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying not to crucify you, but it&#39;s just so hard not to sometimes. Especially with all this extra wood and nails always lying around my apartment.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-66175784-content"><p>I&#39;m having a hard time localizing your complaint here, Anthony.  I think that Zizek would have been able to&#39;ve made a brilliant point had he not been edited to bits by an overzealous producer.  I don&#39;t think we&#39;re disagreeing here.  All I&#39;m saying is that what he was allowed to say was interesting, but that what I imagine he actually said was much, much more so.  I&#39;m not expecting a peer reviewed work here, merely something more than the faux-profundity of (what was likely) the former Discovery Channel director, schooled in the tradition of withholding everything interesting until the final commercial break ... </p>

<p>... in short, between this and the Foucault thread, I just want to spit nails.  How many times can I say &quot;I think the very interesting ideas of these brilliant folk are being obscured by unnecessary detritus&quot; before someone realizes that I do, in fact, believe what I so plainly stated.  (<em>I.e.</em> that I was frustrated by the producers&#39; reluctance to let the man speak, and that if I had my druthers they&#39;d have let him ramble on for a while.)</p></span>

I wasn&#39;t clear, I didn&#39;t mean to suggest that you expected from Zizek a peer-reviewed bladdy-blah, but that you expected from the DVD extra. People get edited and sometimes it comes out badly, from what other people have told me this is not one of those times. This really isn&#39;t a statement about your character, I was just making conversation by pointing out that most people I&#39;ve talked to really like it and that your standards for DVD extras were a bit higher than most peoples. I do hope you won&#39;t write a mock news dialogue saying that I&#39;m stupid now. I do think on the Foucault thing I&#39;ve not really commented on your post the way you are suggesting.</p>

<p>I have to ask though, isn&#39;t editing taking away detritus? I guess it was just a metaphor.</p></span>

The point of my post was to say that I saw germs of more developed thoughts slashed to bits by an editor who wanted to make Žižek look like a layman&#39;s version of an intellectual.  That doesn&#39;t seem like the best approach to Žižek, who plays the role of the public intellectual poorly.  Given that they didn&#39;t fill the DVD with 28 hours of commentary, they could&#39;ve included more with him, such that what he said would be more than just suggestive.  (Again, because what he unintentionally &quot;suggested&quot; sounded so interesting.)</p></span>

<p>I can certainly agree, though, that for someone like yourself who has read Zizek and is pursuing a humanities PhD the editing would obscure what you find interesting (or would have found interesting as the case may be). Seriously, my only point was that you seem to have a minority opinion on this. Nothing wrong in that as it was really just small talk. Sorry it got confused as being part of the great Death to Theory Blog Wars of 2005-continuing.</p></span>

Insofar as public intellectuals are or should do that, he&#39;s phenomenally successful. Insofar as public intellectuals are people who should have stuff to say about politics that will help anyone do anything important about anything which is important, I&#39;ve yet to see evidence of his being one.</p></span>

Yesterday, I discussed the academic variation of the Sanity Preserver, in which the time invested in learning the nuances of a particular body of thought leads to an irrational investment in the thought itself. I am convinced that this investment is different only in degree from the very bane of our existence: the student complaint that the effort put into writing a paper should determine its grade. In both cases, the quality of the work is back-seated to the time invested in producing it—although in its more &quot;mature&quot; form, the time invested is more likely to approach the time the complainant claims to have invested. Not that the outcome is altogether different. The rigidity of thought and distortive perspective persist, only now bound to an insufferable academic identity. More often than not, it is now that the Sanity Preserver passes the torch to the Intentional Omission. One could argue that the Intentional Omission is as unconscious as the Sanity Preserver, that the intentionality is merely the byproduct of years of refusing to countenance uncomfortable facts and arguments in the effort to preserve sanity. There may be something to that, inasmuch as the temper tantrum inevitably following any inquiry suggests some shoddy preservation. Once the stomping stops and the spittle dries, what remains is a picture of academic failure: intelligent enough to have mastered a complex body of thought but lacking the confidence to admit of its shortcomings, this &quot;scholar&quot; has no choice but to turn to the Intentional Omission. This flaw may be summarily dismissed—the illusion of an openness to criticism must be maintained—but that one must never be acknowledged. And so the Intentional Omitter carefully builds the wall behind which his expertise will be expertly defended by himself, a noted expert. As he slides in that last brick, His Expertness sighs a knowing sigh of relief. At long last, he thinks to himself, I have my wall. That it is in his basement, and he behind it, matters little. He will lord over these sad dolls, his only company. Bricked in, he will be free. Experto crede.</span></a></div>
