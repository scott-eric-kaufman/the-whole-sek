<p>And, more generally, reading/experiencing a bad book (or whatever) isn&#39;t the worst that could happen; it&#39;s through occasionally questionable works that one sharpens and develops one&#39;s tastes (a lifelong process).</p></span>

		<span id="comment-19063147-content"><p>Rich, I&#39;m not going to listen to you until you put it in verse.  That said, I&#39;ve read most of what you&#39;ve put there, and I&#39;m reading <i>Transmetropolitan</i> right now.  I like Ellis, but I&#39;m a fan of angry pithiness, so that&#39;s not surprising.</p>

<p>Chance, Seaguy sounds too much like a terrible joke for me to take seriously without some hefty recommendations from well-respected folks.</p>

<p>Tom, That&#39;s a damn fine idea.  I&#39;ll hit you up for them pronto.  And, of coure, you&#39;re correct.  I spent yesterday afternoon delineating exactly what bugged me about <i>The Invisibles</i>, and came to some fairly predictable conclusions: the hippie wishy-washiness and liberatory rhetoric foremost among them.  The thing is, I caught glimmers of criticism--such as when they informed Jack that the blue mold wasn&#39;t hallucinogenic--of a kind of internal critique I could dig.  I also thumbed through me copy of Blake&#39;s &quot;Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot; to see whether that final scene with the John the Baptist&#39;s glossolalia had visual as well as philosophical echoes.  (The answer: No.)  So no, it wasn&#39;t a complete waste of time, merely a disappointment, one which I could avoided had I an official arbiter of taste who could inform me, ahead of time, what I will and will not like.</p>

<p>Rob, That&#39;s not encouraging.  I&#39;ll borrow Tom&#39;s copies and see whether I agree with you about that one.  (I&#39;m partial to the late &#39;90s myself, and could easily thrust myself into that headspace if necessary.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-19066167-content"><p>&quot;I&#39;ve read most of what you&#39;ve put there&quot;</p>

<p>But have you read Muktuk Wolfsbreath, Hardboiled Shaman?  It&#39;s the best noir comic about a Siberian shaman that I&#39;ve ever read.  (Really, it isn&#39;t bad.)</p>

<p>I do have a strange liking for the obscure limited series like that one, or Mobfire.  The best idea from some less-well-known person trying out Vertigo is often better than Morrison being given yet another vehicle that he doesn&#39;t quite know what to do with (Sebastian O, anyone?), or yet another attempt to stretch out a secondary character created by a really good writer into an ongoing series started by a middling good writer and eventually dumped to whoever wants to take over (Hellblazer, Lucifer, Hunter, the Age of Magic, etc.).  Vertigo is always trying to turn an individual vision into an ongoing franchise.</p>

<p>As for verse, no dice.  Unless when you said that you wanted to find verse dealing with turn-of-the century evolutionary theory, you didn&#39;t mean that it had to be *from* the turn of the century.  I could probably whip up some doggerel by July 1 to meet your self-set requirement.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-19073078-content"><p>Morrison told an interviewer something along the lines of &quot;<i>The Invisibles</i> is an optimistic book for children; <i>The Filth</i> is a pessimistic book for adults.&quot; Most of what I found interesting or intelligible in the former was done better, IMO, in the latter.  &quot;Hippy wishy-washiness&quot; is a great characterization of what I&#39;ve seen a number of people describe as the source of their disappointment in <i>The Invisibles</i>.</p>

<p>Having been moved by <i>Seaguy</i>, I&#39;d say it would appear as a terrible joke to readers who&#39;d characterize, say, <i>Brazil</i> in that way.  I think my regard for it was influenced by bloggers like Marc Singer and Dave Fiore.  And the messageboards complaining, &quot;This is <i>weird</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>Rich --good list.  How about <i>Kill Your Boyfriend</i>?  And more Milligan! (<i>Animal Man</i>, <i>Face</i>, <i>The Eaters</i>, <i>The Extremist</i>, <i>Egypt</i>, <i>girl</i> . . . <i>Shade, the Changing Man</i> probably doesn&#39;t hold up as well as one might hope a dozen years later)</p>

<p>Hope these opinions are of value as data points.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/abstractalous_m.html"><span><strong>Abstractalous Mission Statement</strong> One reason I've opened Abstractalous overwhelms all others: I'm terrible at quickly, cogently summarizing what I read. I belabor outlines until they're of equal or greater length than the article they're intended to supplant. That's not a useful skill. Re-writing an article or a chapter in so many different words doesn't help me remember the argument contained therein. So shortly before the accident, I started abstracting what I read in a deliberate fashion unseen since the days of qualifying exams. But I'm not good at it. I miss things. Big things. Things which lead others to believe I'm lying about having read the article. I think this the result of dissertation-scavenging for so long, but whatever its etiology, it must stop. Now. I have drawn the line, in the form of this blog, and I hope you find it as useful to read as I do to write. My purpose is two-fold: Get the argument right. Include all the important nuances. Establish its place in the critical tradition. Provide enough theoretical background so it makes sense to non-specialists. (Because someday you too will forget how to connect-the-dots of that subtle Derridian argument.) Focus on what the argument says, not criticisms of it. Too often the presence of criticism alongside fractures the argument itself. We can hash out the problems with the argument in the comments. The main body should be a direct, uncritical account of the argument in question. It should be the strong form of the argument, so that when we take up arms against it, we do not assail a man of straw. Create a resource for budding literary scholars. A catalog of abstracts they can turn to (or back to) when they need to understand a particular argument about a work of literature. To that end, I want these to be as direct (as per #1) and clearly written as possible. You're probably asking yourself: Why is he setting down these groundrules if he's going to be the only one writing it? Pish-posh. I don't think I'm that important. I also can't write an abstract for every book and/or article out there. I'm offering you the opportunity to help me out. Is your computer larded to the guts with abstracts of everything you've read the past five years? Why not post them? The information isn't proprietary, after all, since no one will ever publish your summaries of other people's publications. However, think of the status you could eventually acquire in the profession's reputation economy: you could be one of the few, the proud, the abstractors. People who took a little time every day to boil important arguments to the bone and put them up there for public consumption. I don't hold out too much hope that other people will agree to participate. But some of you already do something of the sort, so I'm still somewhat sanguine about my chances. But even if all my utopian desires are foiled, this should be a damn fine way for...</span></a></div>
