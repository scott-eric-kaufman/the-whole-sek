<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">You have been withdrawn of late, so their concern is no surprise.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; who cares</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">They evidently do.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; brandish sword</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">You remove your wit from you heart-pocket and approach the women.&nbsp; They cease to gossip.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">You slay them with your tongue.&nbsp; Their guilt for spreading unfounded rumors weighs upon them.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; what</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">Isabel addresses you—</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; who</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">Isabel. 
She says that only this morning you were her supreme court of justice,
but that there was no appeal from your verdict.&nbsp; That not an hour ago
you decided a case for her</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—against herself! And now</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—.
And now the worst of it is that it's not because you've changed. How
does she know if you've changed?&nbsp; You haven't said a hundred words to
her.&nbsp; And yet the years must have enriched you</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—she
daresays you've doubled your capital. You've been in the thick of life,
and the metal you're made of brightens with use.&nbsp; Success on some men
looks like a borrowed coat, she says, but it sits on you as though it
had been made to order.&nbsp; She sees all this; she knows this; but she
doesn't FEEL it.&nbsp; She doesn't feel anything, anywhere, she is numb.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; brandish sword now</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">You say to her, why good God, we belonged to each other</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—that you won't let her go</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; let her go</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—that you've fought for things since that weren't worth a crooked sixpence; fought as well as other men. And she</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—she</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—you lost her because you couldn't make a scene</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—you might have survived them, as men have been known to.&nbsp; They're not necessarily fatal.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; yes are kill self</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">She finds your self-deprecating display charming.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; no with sword</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">You remove a handkerchief from the breast pocket of your dinner jacket.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; where grue</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">You walk
into a gilt bamboo jardiniere, in which the primulas and cinerarias are
punctually renewed, and which blocks access to the bay window, where
the old-fashioned would have preferred a bronze reduction of the Venus
of Milo. The sofas and arm-chairs of pale brocade are cleverly grouped
about little plush tables densely covered with silver toys, porcelain
animals and efflorescent photograph frames, and tall rose-shaded lamps
shoot up like tropical flowers among the plants.&nbsp; There is no grue
here, but to the right is still the Renaissance ballroom.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">&gt; fine fine go ballroom</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">You stand
in the doorway, studying the petty manoeuvres of the women and the
resigned amenities of their partners.&nbsp; You wonder whether these were
your friends, these mincing women, all paint and dye and whalebone,
these apathetic men who looked as much alike as the figures that
children cut out of a folded sheet of paper.&nbsp; Was it to live amongst
such puppets, you ask yourself, that you sold your soul?&nbsp; The bald man
with the globular stomach who made his pile in wrecking railroads and
the political lawyer who had been mixed up to his own advantage in an
ugly lobbying&nbsp; transaction, whose wife was such a good manager that
they kept a brougham and victoria and always put in their season at
Newport and their spring trip to Europe, whose little ferret-faced
youth pretends this is not a domino-party at which the guest are
forbidden to unmask</span><span style="font-family: &quot;OCR-A II&quot;;">—</span></p>

It&#39;s a sweet environment for writing these games in a language that approximates English. For example:</p>

<p><blockquote><br />
Chapter 1 - Outside the Castle</p>

<p>The Drawbridge is a room. &quot;[if the Drawbridge is unvisited]Even in your short absence, [the castle] has come to look strange to you again. When you came here first, you stood a long while on the drawbridge, unready to cross [the moat], for fear of the spells that might bind you if you did. This time it is too late to worry about such things[end if][if the Drawbridge is visited]There is little enough purpose in loitering outside: He and his servants never come out here, and whatever you must do, you will have to do within[end if].&quot; The castle exterior is scenery in the drawbridge. The printed name of the castle exterior is &quot;castle&quot;. Understand &quot;tower&quot; or &quot;tower&quot; or &quot;drawbridge&quot; or &quot;bridge&quot; as the castle exterior. The description is &quot;The drawbridge looks longer than it actually is; the towers are so high that the tops are lost in cloud, and looking east or west, you cannot see the furthest extent of the walls. An optical illusion: it is smaller inside.</p>

<p>Probably.&quot;</p>

<p>The iron-barred gate is a door.  &quot;An iron-barred gate leads [gate direction].&quot; It is north of the Drawbridge and south of the Entrance Hall. It is closed and openable. Before entering the castle, try entering the gate instead. Before going inside in the Drawbridge, try going north instead. Understand &quot;door&quot; as the gate.</p>

<p>After opening the gate:<br />
	say &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be able to open it, heavy as it is, but it swings aside lightly at your touch. The Beast said that it knows friend from enemy; and the castle, at least, still regards you as friend.&quot;</p>

<p>The description of the Entrance Hall is &quot;There is no fire in the big [fireplace][if the Entrance Hall is unvisited], and no one is waiting for you here[end if]; the air is very cold. Over the gate, the old familiar [warning sign] is painted.</p>

<p>Various passages lead deeper into the castle: north towards the central courtyard, southwest to the guard tower, east and west into the libraries, the offices, the galleries. [if beast is seen]And no wonder he was not here to meet you.[otherwise]Somewhere in this maze, he waits; and he should be told as soon as possible that you did return.[end if]&quot;<br />
</blockquote><br />

I responded: You mean my other blog? That'd be The Valve. Reader replied: I know about that one. I mean the secret one where you talk shit about your department and the profession. (A friend told me about it.) I'm adjuncting right now and could use some comical venting. I responded: Are you sure your friend was talking about me? Because to the best of my knowledge—and I'd be the one to know—I don't write a secret blog. Reader replied: Understand if you don't want to share. That kind of complaining can be political dynamite. Don't worry, though, I won't tell anyone about it. I'm not sure how to respond. I'm almost certain I don't have a secret blog. I mean, is this my secret blog? Maybe this is my secret blog? Because I'm pretty sure I don't have a secret blog. Unless I write one I don't know about, like in that book by Philip K. Dick. I wonder, though, is there a secret blog out there in which people slag UCI faculty and whinge about the profession? That might make for some interesting reading. Who do I contact to get its address?</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/02/the-style-of-no.html"><span><strong>The Style of No Style</strong> A very smart man once wrote: I think one of [a particular author's] greatest gifts—one that will be enduring—is, paradoxically, the unevenness of his prose. It makes reading him much more disturbing than, say, reading Kafka, who always writes so well, even when he is turning into a giant bug. The fact that he writes well sort of insulates us, whereas in [this author's] case, the madness is evident in the unsteady prose stylings, and so feels more contagious on our fingertips. I'm currently re-reading one of this author's later novels and am inclined to agree. There's a lurching quality to his mostly competent, sometimes execrable, occasionally brilliant prose. Readers remain uncomfortable, never able to predict whether the next sentence will advance the plot; obliterate the illusion of immersion; or force them to pirouette, spot, and re-read. The prose isn't literary per se, but the effect is. (Think &quot;Nausikaa.&quot;) To wit: &quot;Look,&quot; the voice said. He looked—and saw that his control board, which contained all his communications gear, was on fire. &quot;Jesus Christ,&quot; he said, and reached for the wall switch that would turn on the emergency fire extinguisher. Then he realized something. Something perplexing. The control panel was burning, it was not consumed. Most of you probably know where this is from, but if you didn't—if you encountered a passage like that in the wild—would you be so quick to dismiss it? The splice is artful. The comma's beat lulls you into expecting the ordinary, not something you haven't heard since Hebrew school.</span></a></div>
