This is an all-star team, man; we&#39;ll never beat the postmodernists (to whom Beckett might be traded, if the rumors are true) with a cake at SS.  If you don&#39;t like Conrad, bench him and put in William Carlos Williams.  No heavy-hitter, but a table-setter with quick hands, perfect for that spot in the lineup and the diamond.</p></span>

<p>Starting Beckett over Faulkner?  When exactly is this game being played?  Nineteen-whatever?  Tomemos is right about those pomo rumors, and right about William &quot;Doc&quot; Williams, but why he thinks Faulkner can pitch is beyond me.  He&#39;s a dead ringer for Wade Boggs, after all.</p>

<p>Btw, the thing that kept Derrida out of the HoF was his bizarre claim that both hitting and pitching are both iterable forms of &quot;archehitting.&quot;  Hard to know what to do with a reliever who sees his job as a mere supplement to the game.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-150162123-content"><p><em>Disrespect Conrad if you want, but it&#39;s criminal to put a modernist you don&#39;t like on your lineup just to make fun of him.</em></p>

<p>CR, er, AWP inserted Conrad in the lineup.  I couldn&#39;t do anything about that.  </p>

<p><em>Oh, and how about Faulkner as the closer? Overpowering stuff, but not a lot of endurance in him.</em></p>

<p>I see Faulkner as the folksy, Larry Bowa-type bench coach.  He spins yarns about Teddy Ballgame&#39;s approach at the plate to try and convince Hart &quot;The Rookie&quot; Crane that he need not imitate <em>every single one</em> of his teammates&#39; quirks.  </p>

<p><em>Wyndham Lewis is a perfect pinch hitter, capable of igniting the offense when it&#39;s lethargic.</em></p>

<p>Yes, but would he be an igniter or would he be sticking a fork in one?  You want a quirky <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_McDowell#Prankster_reputation" rel="nofollow">hotfooting reliever</a>, though, Lewis may be your guy.  (Or he may start making love to the pitching machine.  Never can tell.)</p>

<p><em>Robert Penn Warren is a starter converted to long relief, Brooks is the closer, and Wimsatt and Beardsley are lefty one out guys. Empson is the wild man; the fans never forgave him after certain allegations of impropriety, but his pastoral pitch is heart-stopping.</em></p>

<p>Penn Warren is no modernist.  If Faulkner-Bowa is the bench coach, Penn Warren is the Single A coach on the hot seat.  My own loyal devotion aside, I&#39;m not a fan of the bombastic closers.  (But I now love K-Rod.  I now love K-Rod.  I now love K-Rod.)  Give me a workmanlike performance from Kenneth &quot;Mariano&quot; Burke . . . although that doesn&#39;t work, as Mariano has the cutter and the, um, cutter.  Whereas Burke has as many grammars as Matsuzaka has Variations on the Theme of Curve.</p>

<p><em>Hemingway doesn&#39;t seem light enough to make a good leadoff guy.</em></p>

<p>Hemingway is more Pete Rose than Rickey! I admit, but I wouldn&#39;t mind either in the first slot.  (So long as the latter stayed away from the slots.)</p>

<p><em>Starting Beckett over Faulkner?</em></p>

<p>Faulkner&#39;s a hard call to make.  He&#39;s Julio Franco at this point: will you get the raw shortstop singing about soldier&#39;s pay?  The solid third baseman who a flair for sound and fury?  The MVP candidate of <em>1989, 1989!</em> or the wealthy Mexican league cast off in that mansion?  (That and I like him as my bench coach.)</p></span>

Insomnia.</strong> As a child I lulled myself to sleep by imagining myself into the fiction worlds I inhabited by day. I was Ishmael and Frodo and I was Luke Skywalker and the Great American Hero. I visualized myself to sleep through my teens. Every night I strengthened my muscle's memory by ceaselessly starting my swing: load the back leg, close the front shoulder, keep the head steady, uncoil the hips. Again and again until a zen-sent sleep settled down like rain. College was spent perfecting my jump shot: turn the knees in, center the thumb, cock the arm, roll off the index finger. Sleep came quick and stayed sound. Insomnia took me when I started grad school. How could I inhabit a fiction after years of being trained to do exactly otherwise? What use was practicing swings never swung or shots never shot? My nights were spent studying the ceiling while writing essays or chapters in my head. I would exhausted but awoke with plenty of material. Now I simply brood about that which I can't control: students, budgets, jobs, Darfur. When I do drift to sleep I dream I'm at a Halloween party dressed as an uncle's experience of last year's Christmas party after the LSD kicked in. I am Rudolph in the body of a psychedelic Christmas tree. Its needles chafe my skin. On my nose is a bright hot bulb and I have tied a menorah to my head for antlers. The bulb glows brighter and hotter and the world fades into crimson. I am awake. It is 2 a.m. I drift off again and am late for class. I arrive to see my students armed with bows and arrows. They want to win this archery competition but I have yet to teach them which is their dominant eye. I stare blankly at them. I know I know nothing of archery and so do they. But they play along because they want to win their grade then everyone is screaming because someone has shot someone and there has been a death because I didn't teach them what they needed to—and I am awake again. It is 2:30 a.m. I study the ceiling and wonder how other scholars manage sleep. I tell myself I should write a post about it . . .</span></a></div>

The colored man will admit that the calf larceny deserves the severest penalty of the law, and if he were on a jury, he would enforce it too; but let a case of stolen melons come before a court, and he’ll stand up stoutly for acquitted, and he is the delinquent, plead his innocence with an injured air of being unjustly persecuted.
