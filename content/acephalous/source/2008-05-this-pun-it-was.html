<p>But it&#39;s only one number. You have to multiply it by number<i>s</i>. As in, all of them.</p>

<p>Including zero. Which is why there is no pun. It is a times-zero pun.</p></span>

<p>As is -1!</p>

<p><em>Do you ever worry that the person who would hire you recognizes himself in your posts?</em></p>

<p>I doubt it.  I keep it so general that anyone, even the worst punster, would sympathize with the reader of the bad pun instead of the punter who took masturbatory glee in writing it.  That is to say, even if the person who inspired this post read it, they&#39;d think it wasn&#39;t about them, but about someone else who wrote a pun they themselves gagged on.</p>

<p>Also, I came here as a Joycean, so I <em>love</em> a good pun.  But as they say, when writing on the <em>Wake</em>, it&#39;s better to repeat one of Joyce&#39;s than trying to outdo him.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-117240398-content"><p>Maybe it&#39;s more of a challenge for literary writers: The only time I intentionally made a pun in a formal paper was my very first graduate seminar paper. It was <i>awful</i>, but I thought it clever; fortunately, only I and my advisor ever read it. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember, offhand, any examples of significant punning in the published work I&#39;ve read over the last few years, either. It&#39;s just not <i>done</i>.</p>

<p>(note: I love puns, and it&#39;s a fondness my family and spouse shares, much to my mother-in-law&#39;s dismay. I just wouldn&#39;t <i>publish</i> one)</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/05/the-plot-of-oba.html"><span><strong>The Plot of Obama's Tangled Web of Lies Thickens: It Wasn't Even a Concentration Camp</strong> The latest in long line of gaffes conservatives are manufacturing on Obama's behalf concerns the service record of his uncle, Charles Payne, during WWII. Obama claims Payne helped liberate a concentration camp. Only a gullible liberal would believe that. His uncle did nothing of the sort! He helped liberate a work camp, Ohrdurf, not a concentration camp like Auschwitz. Obama is a liar, courting the Jewish vote by inflating the importance of Ohrdurf. When Patton toured Ohrdurf, he didn't &quot;walk over to a corner and sicken.&quot; He did? Who told you that? Him? Mr. Secret Muslim? You'll need to do better than that. You can? I don't believe you. It's not like you have archival footage of Gen. Dwight David Eisenhower, Commander, Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces, Generals Omar M. Bradley, George S. Patton and others viewing the crematorium and the bodies stacked in court yard and woodshed. You do? I see. I also see it's conveniently priced at $649. I'll believe it when I see it, but as everyone knows liberals are only generous with other people's money, I doubt that'll ever happen. You don't even have a graphic, disturbing picture from the camp that should only be viewed by people with strong stomachs and even then only if they're empty. You do? So what. Ohrdurf was a work camp, not a concentration camp. Anyone who ignores this very important, incredibly meaningful, absolutely crucial distinction is simply trying to score political points with the Jewish community.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/05/skewering-acade.html"><span><strong>Skewering Academia, Just Because ...</strong> In a comment on the previous post, Justin asks: Do you ever worry that the person who would hire you recognizes himself in your posts? If I wrote good puns, I'd be unnerved by this post. I would fear that your presence in my department would make me feel inadequate, on account of my inadequate puns. You don't use names, but you skewer most everyone in academia. To address the last point first: I do skewer the excesses of academia, but only because they deserve skewering. My criticism is in the same vein as Mark's, except about trivialities no reasonable scholar wastes three thoughts on. More importantly, I doubt any scholar recognizes him- or herself in my posts. The thing about self-delusion is that it's based on delusional thoughts. I remember the many puns larding my first essay on Finnegans Wake with a horror as histrionic as it is appropriate. They were beastly. The knowledge that I handed a paper overbrimming with them to Margot Norris, one of those rare scholars whose eminence is deserved, will cold dog me to the grave. At the time, however, I mistakenly believed in the transparency of their brilliance. I couldn't have been more wrong. So do I worry that someone will recognize themselves in that post? Only in the way that I do, i.e. as the nightmare of history returning its just verdict. No one believes they currently produce drivel so stimulating they'll be unable to continue working without a brief onanistic indulgence. But they do believe they once believed that. Only with embarrassment do they remember their first overexcited forays into academia. Even if they still love their puns and their unnecessary accoutrement—the insecure plumage of parenthesis, slashes and dashes whose clutter they consider proof of genius—they won't consider this post an affront. These are the puns of an amateur unconvinced of the obviousness of their brilliance. They are the clumsy stabs of the scholar-in-training who, for the moment, is overreaching. Or so I hope.</span></a></div>
