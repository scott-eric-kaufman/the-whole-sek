And stop reading my friggin' blog and start taping your friggin' windows, filling every available container with fresh water, locating your stash of canned green beans and collard greens (and something to open them with), and nailing everything you want ruined (but not lost) onto something stable. Like a concrete patio. In Houston. Good luck to you and yours. (Before anyone says anything, I agree that most of the time the weather isn't news. When it resembles The Day After Tomorrow, however, it's news.) Shades of Galveston dance their frightening dance in my head tonight. I shouldn't say that because Aaron Brown's on CNN saying that &quot;by this time tomorrow we might be looking at Louisiana, at New Orleans, and shaking our heads saying 'Yesterday there was a city there.'&quot; How's that for a cheery, chipper thought? I have many Hurricane Andrew stories, however, and most of them involve stupid adolescent antics in the midst of one of the most dangerous hurricane of the 20th Century. So I have hope that all those I know, love and will be angry beyond the telling of it if they don't evacuate will look around in a week and have humorous flying projectile stories of the same sort I have. (But will they involve Lemonheads like bullets or will they be mundane tales of human survival in the face of natural disaster? Pray for Lemonheads, gentle reader, pray for Lemonheads.) EDIT: There's no reason to panic. Really. From the National Weather Service: AT LEAST ONE HALF OF WELL CONSTRUCTED HOMES WILL HAVE ROOF AND WALL FAILURE. ALL GABLED ROOFS WILL FAIL...LEAVING THOSE HOMES SEVERELY DAMAGED OR DESTROYED. THE MAJORITY OF INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS WILL BECOME NON FUNCTIONAL. PARTIAL TO COMPLETE WALL AND ROOF FAILURE IS EXPECTED. MANY WOOD FRAMED LOW RISING APARTMENT BUILDINGS WILL BE DESTROYED. CONCRETE BLOCK LOW RISE APARTMENTS WILL SUSTAIN MAJOR DAMAGE...INCLUDING SOME WALL AND ROOF FAILURE. HIGH RISE OFFICE AND APARTMENT BUILDINGS WILL SWAY DANGEROUSLY...A FEW POSSIBLY TO THE POINT OF TOTAL COLLAPSE. MANY WINDOWS WILL BLOW OUT. AIRBORNE DEBRIS WILL BE WIDESPREAD...AND MAY INCLUDE HEAVY ITEMS SUCH AS HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES AND EVEN LIGHT VEHICLES. SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES AND LIGHT TRUCKS WILL BE MOVED. THE BLOWN DEBRIS WILL CREATE ADDITIONAL DESTRUCTION. PERSONS...PETS...AND LIVESTOCK EXPOSED TO THE WINDS WILL FACE CERTAIN DEATH IF STRUCK. POWER OUTAGES MAY LAST FOR WEEKS...AS MANY POWER POLES WILL BE DOWN AND TRANSFORMERS DESTROYED. WATER SHORTAGES WILL MAKE HUMAN SUFFERING INCREDIBLE BY MODERN STANDARDS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF NATIVE TREES WILL BE SNAPPED OR UPROOTED. ONLY THE HEARTIEST WILL REMAIN STANDING...BUT BE TOTALLY DEFOLIATED.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/08/four_days_witho.html"><span><strong>Bloggissimus Omnibus, i.e. Every Paragraph a Different Treat (So If You Find One Dull, Skip to the Next)</strong> Four days without regular (by which I mean &quot;constant and dictatorial&quot;) access to computing and networking power has made me realize how much of my life depends upon my laptop: dissertating and blogging (an activity which not only encompasses the act of writing on my blog but also the regular reading of others') are the active outlets; reading the news I otherwise only hear from Jon Stewart, keeping tabs on the latest developments in my statistics-heavy hobby and whittling hours upon hours upon hours away on the most trivial matters are the passive ones. (Though truth be told, for the humanistically inclined any hobby which involves crunching numbers shouldn't be considered &quot;passive.&quot; Still, this one--despite the mathematics involved--is more than a whit indulgent.) All of that said, all I can say is that I've so much to say that I can hardly decide where to start. There's the umbicular connection I share with my malfunctioning laptop. I realize this, recognize the problem and scream inside my head everytime I can't record some mundanity in an ephemeral email to myself (which I'll never read or even remember writing come day's end). Then there's the fact that My Hometown (despite my self-identification with Brooklyn and northern New Jersey and the years spent in the Canadian hinterland), what Huey Long compulsively called &quot;The Great State of Louisiana,&quot; currently stands more submerged than usual come creole August, and that the estimated death toll rises with every learned estimation. The emails I've received from friends in the midst of it remain unencouraging. One friend's father has lost everything, another's mother only materialized after three agonizingly uncommunicative days, and still another's brother remains among the missing. I could blather on for days about what the tragedy that is My Hometown at this moment, but my blather would only trivialize the magnitude of the events about which I blather. On a similarly somber subject, Badger (of Badgerings) lost her husband last Monday. Even though I only know her through that most tenuous of tenuous connections (the polite acknowledgment of the link), I send my sympathies and (were I one to pray) all the prayers I know. But since I'm not one to pray I'll settle for sending my thoughts, so that she knows her husband's touched lives so distant, so removed, and will not be forgetton. (And while it may seem untoward to address her grief in so omnibus an entry, since I don't know when I'll have unfettered access again, I think the sentiment outweighs whatever violation of decorum I've committed. Best to you and yours in your time of trials, Badger.) Come Monday I decided to attend this year's MLA (so that I've experienced one before I scour another for reasonable job offers) and have no idea how to follow through with this decision. Do I purchase a ticket, book a hotel room and wander from motel-to-hotel in search of thems that I know and thems that I'd like to? (Paging Mr. McLemee, Mr. McCann,...</span></a></div>
