	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
			<p>I was <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/07/about-that-rolling-stone-cover">initially dismissive</a> of the “controversy” concerning the latest <em>Rolling Stone </em>cover because it originated from people making arguments <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2013/07/17/celebs-decry-rolling-stone-cover-choice">like this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cover of <em>Rolling Stone</em> was once reserved for
 the newest bands, the hottest singer-songwriters or the pop culture 
phenoms grabbing the country by the scruff of its neck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christian Toto, the author of this one, strikes me as one of those 
“internet researchers” whose store of knowledge consists of ideas 
half-mastered and mistakenly remembered, the sort that require a quick 
search to “confirm” that <em>Rolling Stone</em> is “about” music. He has
 no personal connection with or real knowledge of the magazine and 
doesn’t desire any. This lack of intellectual curiosity is made manifest
 in the rest of his post, which consists of quoting “celebrities” like 
Ralph Macchio re-tweeting the sage words of “one of the creative forces 
behind HBO’s <em>Entourage</em>.” The limitations of such critics notwithstanding, they accidentally stumbled over a solid point. To quote <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/07/about-that-rolling-stone-cover/comment-page-1#comment-598621">joe from lowell</a>:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The criticism here isn’t that a lowly music magazine is breaking from
 routine and lionizing Tsarnaev — it’s an aesthetic judgment that 
acknowledges what <em>Rolling Stone </em>tried and failed to do. The 
difference, in other words, between conservative and aesthetic critics 
of the image is that only the latter are capable of correctly assessing 
its intent and judging its effectiveness. Conservative critics 
legitimately believe that <em>Rolling Stone</em>‘s trying to disseminate
 images of dreamy Islamic radicalism to impressionable American youths, 
whereas aesthetic critics can read the words beneath the image and 
understand that the cover fails rhetorically. I think Other Scott <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/07/that-settles-it-2">need not fear the progeny of strange bedfellows</a>
 — this is just the most recent case of deliberate conservative 
misprision. They see what they want to, so when they look at the <em>Rolling Stone </em>cover, instead of seeing what’s printed:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/rolling-stone02.jpg"><img alt="" height="556" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/rolling-stone02.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="rolling stone02" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>They see what’s politically convenient:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/rolling-stone03.jpg"><img alt="" height="555" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/rolling-stone03.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="rolling stone03" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>The context is still <em>technically </em>there, but it’s rendered 
inscrutable by the controversial imperative: “Act only according to that
 maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that all should become 
offended by a universal flaw.” Defining the entire cover down to 
Tsarnaev’s self-portrait — treating it as if the words didn’t exist — 
allowed conservatives to circulate an ahistorical and acontextual 
version of it that’s offensive to everyone. Much like the fight between 
Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman began when Martin landed his first 
blow, conservatives have managed to bracket the conversation about this 
“controversy” such that the image being discussed is, by and large, the 
second one above. Having done so, they can rally their cultural warriors
 against the Shariah-loving editorial board of <em>Rolling Stone</em> with the usual dishonest gusto.</p>
<p>But liberal and aesthetic critics should have sense enough to realize
 that the problem with this cover wasn’t in its intent so much as its 
execution. In all honesty, I don’t think <em>Rolling Stone </em>should 
be criticized for its visual-rhetorical failure here, but for rehashing 
the tired trope of “The Monster Next Door.” That’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Morrison">Keith Morrison</a>‘s bailiwick, and Saturday mornings on MSNBC would be infinitely poorer if <em>Rolling Stone </em>put him out of business.</p>

The evidence all points to Zimmerman becoming increasingly obsessed with the presence of black males at his apartment complex in the months leading up to Trayvon Martin's death. Prior to April 2011, Zimmerman's 911 calls were the work of the neighborhood busybody. For example, he called to report: 12 August 2004: &quot;a male in a green Ford pickup&quot; 20 August 2004: &quot;an open garage door&quot; 27 April 2005: another &quot;open garage door&quot; 17 March 2005: &quot;pothole that is blocking the road&quot; 21 September 2005: &quot;a stray dog&quot; 10 June 2009: &quot;fire alarm going off&quot; 7 September 2009: another &quot;pothole in the road&quot; 22 September 2009: &quot;yellow bike ... doing wheelies&quot; But starting in August of 2011, Zimmerman's calls took on a decidedly different note. He reported: 3 August 2011: &quot;[a] black male last seen wearing a white tank top and black shorts,&quot; who he &quot;believes ... is involved in recent [burglaries]&quot; 6 August 2011: &quot;two black males ... in their teens&quot; 23 September 2011: yet another &quot;open garage door,&quot; but specifies reason for calling is &quot;neighborhood watch [meeting] last night&quot; 1 October 2011: &quot;two black males ... 20 - 30 [years old] in Chevy [possibly] Impala at the gate of the community,&quot; about whom Zimmerman's concerned because he &quot;does not recognize [the subjects] or [vehicle] and is concerned due to recent burglaries&quot; 29 January 2012: children &quot;running and playing in the street&quot; 2 February 2012: &quot;[black male last seen wearing] black leather jacket, black hat, printed PJ pants [who] keeps going to [the same] location&quot; And then on 26 February 2012 he calls about Trayvon Martin. There's a pattern here obvious to anyone without an investment in not seeing it. What began as annoying 911 operators with pointless complaints escalated to notifying the authorities any time he saw a black male he didn't know. The argument that he's not racist and wasn't profiling is based on the fact that he &quot;mentored black children&quot; and &quot;had black friends&quot; and is entirely beside the point, because it presumes that he's an overt and deliberate racist. Those who make it claim victory when they demonstrate that he never wore a white hood or bedecked his body in Nazi ink. I'll grant that that Zimmerman didn't pine for the days of short ropes and sturdy limbs. I'll grant that he didn't dream of goose-stepping down the Champs-Élysées in his dress browns. But I won't grant that race didn't color his judgment when it came to young black men with whom he wasn't personally acquainted. From 3 August 2011 forward he's increasingly -- and almost exclusively -- concerned with unfamiliar black males in his apartment complex. Maybe confirmation bias is more the problem here than racism, but the fact remains that the bias being confirmed is that young black males are suspects until...</span></a></div>

One side-effect of such viewings is that I sometimes drift in and out of consciousness during commercial breaks, and I assume that anything I remember watching is a daft melange of half-heard words and half-remembered dreams of the sort an almost-deaf person might concoct to explain the episode to himself after the fact. Like the time I watched that episode about Big Boi being eaten by hyenas after Detective Stabler was shot over a monkey in a basketball — that had to the product of secondary elaboration. Only it wasn’t. So, when I awoke this morning convinced that I’d seen two seasons of Doctor Who spoiled by a 2008 episode of SVU about “sexting,” I couldn’t just chalk it up to shoddy dreamwork. I fired up the Netflix machine, turned on the closed captions and wouldn’t you know it? A 2008 episode of SVU does contain the mother of all spoilers for the fifth and sixth seasons of Doctor Who. See what I mean below the fold: But I’m sure it’s just a coincidence.</span></a></div>
