<p>Compounding my difficulty is that from the street, these monstrosities are indistinguishable from the stolid brownstones flanking them on either side.&nbsp; Only when you open the front door and step into a mud-walled bathroom in which a stove sits beneath a sign reading &quot;FOR SHITTING APRICOTS&quot; do you sense something is amiss.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In short, convincing you that a conventional-sounding statement about social evolution is no more rational than a foyer dedicated to disposing peaches ain't the easiest stunt to pull.&nbsp; Here's my malformed attempt:</p>

<blockquote><p>Early in [&quot;<a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/WhaDesc.html">The Descent of Man</a>&quot;], [Edith] Wharton mentions [Professor Linyard's] authorship of
“Ethical Reactions of the Infusoria” and “The Unconscious Cerebration of
Amoeba” (314). These microscopic animals
are not, however, his area of expertise: “On the structure and habits of a
certain class of coleoptera [beetles],” Wharton writes, “he was the most
distinguished living authority” (318). His
interest in infusoria indicates the speculative—almost unscientific, but
certainly unprofessional—cant of his thought. </p>

<p>That he extends his investigation into the ethics of infusorial reaction
points to a metaphysical tendency extant prior to writing [his popular mockery of metaphysically informed &quot;science&quot;] <em>The Vital Thing.</em> Infusoria are
so named because they appear in infusions of decaying organic matter. Throughout the latter half of the nineteenth
century, debates as to the classification of infusoria persisted. “Though the term Infusoria has usually been
applied to all the Protozoa provided with cilia or flagella,” declares A.S.
Packard in 1875, “it is not restricted to the highest [Ciliata] division of the
Protozoa” (87). </p>

<p>In the same issue of <em>The American Naturalist </em>in which
Packard’s essay appears, noted evolutionist T.H. Huxley places them within the
category of “Endoplastica,” which “while not forsaking the general type of the
single cell, attain a considerable complexity of organization” (66). Infusoria are thus single-celled animals with
uncharacteristic complexity; unless, that is, they are not animals at all. David S. Kellicott, delivering the keynote
address at the annual meeting of the American Society of Microscopists, notes
that it is without question that “these [infusoria] teeming in the hay infusion
are alive,” then asks, “but why relegate them to the animal kingdom rather than
to the vegetable?” (14). </p>

<p>He then reminds
his fellow microscopists that no lesser light than Ernst Haeckel proposed a
third kingdom, Protista, in which to include animals with chlorophyll-bearing
bodies. Straddling the fence between
animal and vegetable, infusoria and related protozoa occupied a central place
in early debates about the evolution of mind. The eminent neo-Lamarckian E.D. Cope argues that 

</p><blockquote><p>It is evident…that education
commences low in the scale, since some of the acts of Infusoria indicate an adaptation
of means to ends which cannot be supposed to be possible to a totally new
experience. The discharge of weapon-like
cilia of the Dinidium at its prey would indicate that the animal knew the
effect of the act from past experience, and anticipated that food would be
secured in this way from its success in previous performances of the kind.
(“The Evolution of Mind,” 904)</p></blockquote>

<p>Linking consciousness to adaptations like “weapon-like
cilia” is a conventionally Lamarckian move, for “specialization of structure
means specialization of function; and specialization of function means
accomplished education” (903).&nbsp; Specialization is the result of adaptations
acquired over time, Cope argues, and the mechanism of adaptation for Lamarckians
is force of will; therefore, if infusoria possess specialized
structures—and they do—then Cope must “[believe] in the presence of
consciousness in Protozoa” (903). </p>

<p>That
it would have been possible to believe that microscopic organisms occupying the
neutral slot between animal and vegetable possess rudimentary consciousness is
enough to open infusoria to endless speculation of the sort Linyard produces in
<em>The Vital Thing</em>; that they were
considered immortal by many opened more pseudoscientific avenues still.</p>

<p"></p"><p>R. von
Lendenfeld outlines the argument for infusoria immortality in “The Undying
Germ-Plasm and the Immortal Soul” (1891). The theory originates with the fierce neo-Darwinian, vehement
anti-Lamarckian August Weismann who, as von Lendenfeld summarizes, argued:

</p><blockquote><p>All unicellular beings, such as the
Protozoa and the simpler Algae, Fungi, &amp;c., reproduce themselves by means
of simple fission. The mother-organism
may split into two similar halves, as the Amoeba does, or, as is more common in
the lowest unicellular plants, it may divide into a great number of small
spores. In these processes it often
happens that the whole body of the mother, the entire cell, may resolve itself
into two or more children; at times, however, a small portion of the
mother-cell remains unused…From this it follows that these unicellular beings
are immortal. (92)</p></blockquote>

<p>Despite being only arguably animal, infusoria possess
consciousness and are immortal, which facts forced scientists and sociologists
to consider the possibility that “colonies” of infusoria were but a single, immortal
individual. Even if it is, the
cooperation between individual infusoria are considered the basis of what in
1902 Arthur Allin calls “sociality.” </p>

<p>Following Herbert Spencer’s analogy of society as an organism, Allin
notes that “Selfishness necessarily generates altruism. The chalk cliffs of infusoria are the result
of the individualistic action of each of the infusoria, the infusorium being
typical of egoism” (81). The infusoria
thus represented the lowest form of life in which social behaviors equivalent
to those of human society could be observed. As Henry Fairfield Osborn observed in 1892, “the most impressive truth issuing
from…recent researches in evolution and heredity is the uniformity of life-processes
throughout the whole scale of life from Infusoria to man” (668).</p></blockquote><p>Does that sound suitably insane?&nbsp; </p>

		<span id="comment-76831042-content"><p>Hearing &#39;immortality&#39; and &#39;Ernst Haeckel&#39; in the same breath reminds me that this kind of talk isn&#39;t limited to 19th C. &#39;protista&#39; and &#39;germ-plasm.&#39; You do know that Haeckel had a hand in the definition of  the concept <i>stem cell</i>, a definition which still has resonance and relevance today?</p>

<p>I think <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=16479584&dopt=Abstract" rel="nofollow">this article</a> does a reasonable job of reviewing early terminology and exploration of SCs.</p>

<p>The idea of &#39;immortality&#39; is important here as well -- stem cells were originally seen as defined by their ability to proliferate and self-regenerate, making them effectively immortal.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s only been in the last few years that we&#39;ve been able to actually unravel what that <i>means</i>, in molecular and genetic terms.  </p>

<p>Anyway.  It&#39;s not like these ideas are just the &#39;bad science&#39; of the 19th century.  The strains and descendants of this kind of thought have seeped into the models and ideas of a lot of modern scientists, too.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-76868058-content"><p>I&#39;m not sure which parts of the paragraph you&#39;re actually picking out as bad science.  I&#39;m going to number some possibilities to try to get more clarity:</p>

<p>1.  The idea that purposeful-seeming behavior implies consciousness.  This, I agree, is an interesting Lamarckian pseudo-scientific bit as written in the example from E.D. Cope, with the discharge of cilia implying the learning of effects from experience.</p>

<p>2. The idea that organisms that reproduce by fission can be immortal.  This idea is, as far as I can tell, still in use.  If you agree that a single-celled organism has no individual consciousness, then really all it has is unbroken metabolic activity and an unchanged genetic code to say that it has not yet died.  So it seems like a single-celled organism that reproduces by fission could be said to be immortal until a time is reached at which all of its descendents are either dead or their genetic material has mutated.  This isn&#39;t immortality in the way that a person&#39;s soul is sometimes believed to be immortal, but it isn&#39;t mortality in the sense that a person suffers from either.</p>

<p>3.  The idea that organisms with the same DNA form a single super-organism.  The idea that a colony is best thought of as an individual seems pretty common in neo-Darwinian writing.  And I&#39;ve seen popular biological articles about the largest living organism being some form of fungus that spreads underground for miles with unchanging DNA; clearly that&#39;s on a similar principle.</p></span>

I use the conventional approach of cultural evolution myself although I am not a scientist. As I don&#39;t know anyone else working on such themes who exactly is incorrect and shitting for apricots? The remark with regard to reinforcing social prejudice I find particularly ironic (though not I would note in a P. modernist sense) As most of what I do is informed by an evolutionary perspective seems a bit weird.</p>

<p><a href="http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1975HisSc..13....1B&data_type=PDF_HIGH&whole_paper=YES&type=PRINTER&filetype=.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1975HisSc..13....1B&amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;type=PRINTER&amp;filetype=.pdf</a></p>

<p>Like Lovejoy I have an interest in Lord Monboddo, which is where I first came across A.O.L. Monboddo of course had a particular interest in the beaver. His work of course was not scientific but I think that is clearly demonstrated when it comes to discussing his very unusual taste in source material.</p></span>

Showering to the smell of stale bong water invigorates my soul. Watching your morning fog on its miasmatic creep from the bathroom into the hall, then from the hall into my office, is the highlight of my day. You have a kind heart. However, I find the material I produce in the wake of your morning ablution decidedly subpar. This morning I transcribed a passage from Herbert Spencer's Psychology thus: &quot;Every form of Intelligence being, in essence, an adjustmust of inner to outer relations; it results that as, in the advance of this adjustmust, the outer relations increase number, in complexity, in heterogeneity, by degrees that cannot be marked.&quot; Granted, in terms of Lamarckian adaptation, the neologism &quot;adjustmust&quot; has some traction: individuals who &quot;adjustmaybe&quot; are less likely to survive than the &quot;adjustmusters&quot; who crane their necks for the next highest leaf. But I digress. (I do that a lot lately.) I know what you're thinking: &quot;Dude. Just 'cause you see my smokes in your place don't mean you score a contact high. Seriously.&quot; Perhaps. You do know about those scientific studies of scent and cognitive function, right? The ones saying strong scents like peppermint work as mnemonics, and that you remember what you were thinking when you first smelt those smells? Because let me tell you: The crap my brain excavates every time you pump my place full of your noxious weed ain't exactly helping me finish my dissertation. Quite the opposite. It would be awesome if you could do your business in some room not connected to any of mine. If you must—if it's bathroom or bust—maybe not toke so early in the morning or keep it up for quite so long. You have work to do, and I'm sure the shirts you smoke don't help so much. Make an adjustmust. All will be cool.</span></a></div>
