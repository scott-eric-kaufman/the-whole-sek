While waiting for the former to process so that the lady at the latter's desk could perform her assigned task without frowning and huffing and asking whether it would be too much trouble to fill out this seventy-four page affidavit proving that I had already deposited all arms and legs owed the University of California Regents—while avoiding that, I wandered the third floor in search of a rare (during midterm week) empty cubicle. Finally I found one inhabited by a stack of books but sans any other scholarly elluvia, so I sat down to read some George Eliot. Two minutes passed before the shame of having possibly stolen some bathroom-bound undergraduate's cubicle drove me to look at the stack of books before me. A couple of Twayne's Guides to Sounding Like You've Actually the Read the Book and Mastered the Criticism, a copy of China Mieville's Looking for Jake and a copy of Adam Robert's Stone. I looked at that one suspiciously. &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;I know an Adam Roberts who writes science fiction novels.&quot; So I started reading it. Then I stopped... ...after an abosrbing hour. I put the book down, rescued my hostages from the untroubled inter-library loan lady and walked home. Then I ordered Stone. (Yes, I know, dissertation. And I'm on it. But Stone has passages in desperate need of underlining and, good egg that I am, I can't deface library property.) Plus, his new novel is a tribute to Y.T. called Land of the Headless. I expect those royalty checks to start streaming in any month now.</span></a></div>

Instead I copy this doggerel copped and forwarded by mine beloved: withLeefen I her on tha morrow Drawen to memorie wolde I be? Fore wenden I moot be, anon, For sith tha bene so greet londes moot I sey. But, if bileven her wytht ye, mayde, Thyngis coldna bene algates. For sith anon I be quit as ane foule, And this foule ye conna chaunge. Tha Lorde konne, I conna chaunge. If Skynyrd do not for ye, tha Lord konne ye love Shaft: Wha be tha blake prevy lawe That bene wantoun too alle tha feres? Shaft! Ya damne righte! Wha be tha carl tha riske is hals wolt Fro is allye leve? Shaft! Konne ye? Wha be tha carl wha ne wolden flee Whan peril bene all aboughte? Shaft! Verray! Alle clepe tha carl ane badde mooder- Softe! Speken of Shaft bene I. Than konne alles we! He be a man konne unnethes Namo save is mayde konnes im. JOHN SHAFT! This warbled blasphemy brought to ye by the wife and the venerable Geoff Chaucer. Were I not too annoyed with Typepad to write words of value I would best this Chaucer at his own game. For tonight, I defer to the whims of technological failures and promise my beloved audience a Wakean &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot; come tha morrow.</span></a></div>
