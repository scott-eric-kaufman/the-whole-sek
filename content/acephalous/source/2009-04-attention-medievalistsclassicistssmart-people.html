There is also Monika Otter on Gerald of Wales in her book Inventiones (Gerald describes a utopia of tiny men that is quite entrancing). Otter connects it to Gerald&#39;s nostalgia for his lost possibility of &quot;true&quot; Welshness.</p></span>

<p>Aside from the obvious Persephone reference and Garden of Eden/Pandora overtones, I&#39;m reminded of the (modern Western) tradition of Egyptian mummy curses, where death stalks those who remove anything from a tomb..... The Egyptians did have a tradition of magical stories (I used a World History reader with a fantastic tale called &quot;Setne Khamwas and Naneferkapta&quot;; it was gone in the next edition, and I stopped using it), but I don&#39;t know enough to point the way. </p></span>

Otter&#39;s reading of William of Malmesbury&#39;s Gerbert/ Pope Sylvester II tale is one of the few studies I&#39;ve found to date, along with David Rollo&#39;s chapter on the same text. </p>

<p>Ahistoricality: Persephone! How did I manage to miss the Persephone reference? (Slapping self on forehead...)  </p>

Ofelia, like Orpheus, is still alive and well after breaking the one rule that she was given.  They both have to live knowing what they have lost.</p>

<p>There may be some Lot&#39;s-wife-pillar-of-salt sort of thing going on here too, but maybe that&#39;s more of a stretch. <br />

<p>Also, you&#39;d need a good South Asianist to say definitively whether it shows up in the Indian/subcontinental traditions at all: I haven&#39;t run across anything like it, but it&#39;s not really my area. Anything which shows up in 1001 Nights is under suspicion of being Indian in origin, of course.</p>

<p>Bilbo gets away with it; Smaug was going to wreck destruction on <i>someone</i> once the dwarves got there, so you really can&#39;t lay it on the thief.</p></span>

(Even Odysseus and the gift of Aiolus would have some similarities, along with Pandora and the Garden of Eden.)</p>

<p>I imagine that, while the setting of underground palaces might change, the narrative of arrival - rule - breach of rule - exile is pretty universal.  There&#39;s a wonderful Coyote story in which he travels to find his dead wife, back when the living and dead were more connected.  But Coyote breaks the rules and the line between life and death is from that point on rigidly defined.  </p>

<p>So much of this ties to traditional ideas of hospitality: a guest is fed, while a thief steals; a host feeds, while a monster feeds on a guest.</p>

<p>None of this is helpful, but I like thinking about folklore.</p></span>

There might be some discussion of this in Tolkien&#39;s essay &quot;Beowulf: The Monster and the Critics&quot;.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I&#39;m pretty sure there was no mention of human statues in the dragon&#39;s hoard.</p></span>

<p>First, let me point you at <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodChains" rel="nofollow">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodChains</a> and <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldilocksAndTheMinesOfMoria" rel="nofollow">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldilocksAndTheMinesOfMoria</a> which have varying examples.  Tvtropes is actually a good site tracking down examples of a specific related trope once you identify it.</p>

<p>Besides what’s there (and the Goldilocks exemplar is one of those duh examples). I can’t think of any other really pat examples except for Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell (it’s been a while and I can’t remember the specifics, but Arabella is drawn further and further into the celebrations of Lost Hope and out of the world as she accepts gifts) and Young Sherlock Holmes (Watson, drugged, starts eating food, which comes to life to attack him).  However, there are many, many sort of related things.</p>

<p>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has a number of kids who go into a strange place and are tempted (and picked off by) giving in to lust for possession of food.</p>

<p>The related tropes that intersect in this trope include:</p>

<p>The opulent hall/mansion which is actually dilapidated with spirits that want you to join them (Jonathan Strange, Disney’s Haunted Mansion ride -999 ghosts, make it an even 1,000, etc. – even the French Plantation scene in the longer version of Apocalypse Now)</p></span>

<p>The innocent thrust into a corrupt but attractive setting, trying to get out without being pulled back (this is the underpinning of your tale – noir, especially Lynchian Noir like Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks/Fire Walk with Me, the Bible, especially the Passover stuff – Exodus 12, I think – and the Sodom and Gomorrah story – leaving corruption with a rule to prove you are untouched, in this case don’t look back – salt pillar thing – as opposed to don’t take anything).</p>

<p>The physical object you weren’t supposed to take/touch/eat deal (don’t touch it trope <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ptitle2me3m8d0" rel="nofollow">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ptitle2me3m8d0</a> ).  Also see garden of eden (forbidden fruit <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit" rel="nofollow">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit</a> ).</p>

<p>Decent into underworld/down the rabbit hole aspect (<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownTheRabbitHole" rel="nofollow">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownTheRabbitHole</a> and spurs off of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shadowland" rel="nofollow">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shadowland</a> ), or mines of Moria thing.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.  It was just sort of a quick brain dump.  I could actually go on about this stuff, but my day is too fragmented and I type too slowly.  BTW, I think you have some sort of LSU/Louisiana connection?  I’m NOLA born and raised, my wife is red stick born and raised, and I spent 10 years at LSU (BS, MD, PhD), while my wife spent 4 (BA).  We live in Vegas now. </p>

<p>Oh, and there&#39;s some eastern mythology stuff (Japanese myth) in the first couple of links. Take care.</p></span>

It&#39;s only a case of bad timing that ultimately brings them down.

His book contains rules of grammar phrased as direct orders.&quot;</strong> On this day in 1959 as you may already know, The Elements of Style by William Strunk, Jr. and E.B. White was published by the MacMillan Publishing Company. To this day the college students that read The Elements of Style learn how to properly utilize; a semicolon, dashes, colons and the serial comma. Thinking about it, the prose of none of these students was perfect: but with hard work their writing will be great! You would anticipate such improvement when the book in question is regarded as being the best guide to direct and/or concise writing ever written. An especially meaningful example of directness comes from the noted prose stylist, Herbert Spencer, who in his not ironically named Philosophy of Style wrote about compelling examples: In proportion as the manners, customs, and amusements of a nation are cruel and barbarous, the regulations of its penal code will be severe. There is no doubt but that this second quotation is superior: In proportion as men delight in battles, bullfights, and combats of gladiators, will they punish by hanging, burning, and the rack. Spencer is a man who knows the proper insertion of the particular for expressive purposes is a subject with which all good writers should be familiar. The Elements of Style is both a great book and not tedious to read---but one must watch his or her step lest they depersonalize their prose for the foreseeable future. Which is possible because the truth is, some of the advice they give has the effect of flattening prose: as when, for example, you are told not to use the adverb &quot;tangledly&quot; because no one, at least no one they know (or knew, depending on whether Strunk, White or the current editor, of the fourth edition, named Roger Angell, is the person who is speaking out against &quot;tangledly&quot;) ever said the word &quot;tangledly&quot; out loud, even though the word &quot;tangledly&quot; would literally be the most appropriate word to describe a sentence like, for example, this one. So as not to inject too much of my own opinion into this celebration of The Elements of Style today, I will stop this post here, hopefully long after you realize what it is I have done, which is to boldly piss on their grave.

The book in question: Warren Ellis's one-shot cross-over between the Wildstorm imprint Planetary and the DC franchise that is the Batman. Ellis created the book as a means of investigating the enduring popularity of the superhero genre. Over the course of thirty-odd issues his team of quasi-cultural anthropologists tore through the history of the 20th Century in an attempt to answer that deceptively simple question: Why have impossible people in tights mattered so much for so long? Planetary/Batman: Night on Earth (2003) opens by jiggering that old comic standby: the multiverse. An incidental murderer named John Black has been having seizures, and every time he seizes, a blue dome extends from his body and shifts him and everyone else from one dimension to another. The dome looks like this: The people who shift from a point in their dimension to an already-occupied point in another end up like this: Not a pleasant way to die. So the Planetary team is called in to investigate. They learn that Black's fingerprints were recently found outside a soup kitchen and go to investigate. They corner him in an alley when: They reorient themselves and move to apprehend him when they hear something above them: That would be Batman circa 2003. How do I know? The Batsuit lacks the yellow shield around the symbol on his chest, meaning this iteration must come before the introduction of the &quot;New Look&quot; suit in Detective Comics #329 (July 1964) or after they retired the shield in Detective Comics #742 (March 2000): Factor in the photorealistic gestures and that can only be the Batsuit of the 21st Century. But why did folks at DC decide to go with the throwback costume at the dawn of a new century? Nostalgia? What happened in 2000 that made the less cartoonish Batsuit more attractive to fans of the book? Because the subtraction of the shield was not the only change: the greys now skew black, the blues shift black-navy, and the yellow of the utility belt pales to a washed and muted gold. My class and I begin to talk a little about the turn of the last century within the context of the story—at this point a fight between one member of the Planetary team and Batman—until the scene abruptly shifts again to reveal: Adam West! We talk about what America would have been like when the show was on the air (1966-1968) and then I show them this clip. Why would people in the 1960s want a Batman who walks into a bar and orders orange juice? What would have been appealing about a Batman who was a fully deputized Peace Officer in the Gotham City Police Department? They respond very generally about the Civil Rights Movement and Vietnam and and drugs and hippies and the perceived erosion of the moral fabric of society—at which point I stop and ask, &quot;Who exactly was perceiving...</span></a></div>
