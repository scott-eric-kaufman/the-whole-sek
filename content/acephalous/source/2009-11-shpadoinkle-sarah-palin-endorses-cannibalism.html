		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a6a89c51970b-content"><p>The theology is twisted. God <i>didn&#39;t</i> intend for humans to eat animals. Genesis, Chapter <b>ONE</b>:<br />
<blockquote>29: And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.<br />
30: And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.</blockquote><br />
Only later, after the abomination and destruction of all life but Noah&amp;Co., does God permit the eating of meat. Chapter Nine:<br />
<blockquote>1: And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.<br />
2: And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.<br />
3: Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.</blockquote><br />
God then goes on to start writing the rules of Kashrut. God may have made animals (and people) edible, but allowing them to be eaten was Plan B.</p></span>

Eisenhower Bowing Hour!</strong> (Apparently TypePad timed out and didn't post this yesterday, in case you're wondering why it only went up now.) Seems someone forgot to tell Ike what everyone on the right knows (but oddly never cites a source for): the President never ever bows. Because as even a cursory search of the AP Image archive indicates, the man could not stop bowing. Hello there, Pope John XXIII! Howdy to you, wife of Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Gronchi! Hi again, Archbishop Iakovos of New York, Primate of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America! Long time no see, Charles De Gaulle! By their logic, I believe that last bow means we have all been French since 2 September 1959. Eisenhower clearly demonstrated by that bow that the American President is a subordinate of the French, which means that for the past 50 years America has been a French territory with pretensions of sovereignty. Mon Dieu!</span></a></div>

Let me tell you.</strong> My old monitor was issuing death rattles—taking three days to turn on without flickering and the like—so with the money you people so generously provided by buying stuff I recommend from Amazon, I purchased a new one under the impression that it was the same size as my current one. It is not. It is oppressively large. It looms over me. I moved it further back on the desk and am slouching in my chair not because I have good eyes and bad posture, but because I am frightened by the monstrosity in front of me. I can now fit three formerly maximized windows on my screen at the same time, or (and this might not be a bad thing), maximize a single window and become more creative through the power of bilateral symmetry.</span></a></div>
