But I&#39;m not! According to <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/12/17/mla">the MLA&#39;s annual forecast on job listings</a>:

<blockquote>In English the fields with the greatest percentage of positions are rhetoric and composition (20.1 percent), British literature (17.9 percent), multiethnic literature (13.7 percent), creative writing (7.0 percent), and American literature (6.1 percent).</blockquote>

But to rehash the old argument, it&#39;s a mistake to conflate literary theory and critical theory, especially when teaching non-majors what might otherwise learn portable skills. To put this in less polemical terms: I&#39;m baffled by the fact that most composition programs teach their largely non-English-major populations how to quote and cite material in MLA format. It&#39;s not that I have anything against MLA style <em>per se</em>, only that I think the needs of the students would be better served if they learned how to cite material in accordance with the arcane rules of their future fields. The only reason so many programs teach MLA is because that&#39;s all most composition instructors know, so that&#39;s what they feel qualified to grade. I&#39;m not running anybody down, then, merely seconding Wally&#39;s contention that there&#39;s a disconnect between what we hope to accomplish through the classroom and what we do in it.

<blockquote>Peak intellectual jobs are supposed to be what you get a Ph.D. to get. If people are getting Ph.D.s and not the jobs that a Ph.D. is supposed to prepare you for—and Scott&#39;s is not simply an individual case of this—then something in society is broken.</blockquote><p>

I see what you&#39;re saying now: the training of people for jobs that never existed is a toxic practice, and anyone who—unlike me—would be unable find satisfaction in the jobs that do exist has been mistreated. You&#39;ll get no argument from me on this count. 

<strong><br /></strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>On Beards:</strong></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>[Y]ou shaved the beard?</blockquote>

Now that I&#39;m an adult, I don&#39;t need facial hair to feel like one. Or I simply like the routine: not shaving became an excuse to feel like a shut-in even when I left the house.</blockquote>

<p>&quot;That never existed&quot; needs clarification -- those jobs once did exist, but they were taken away.</p>

<p>You also keep returning to this same trope: previously it was important happiness, now it&#39;s you finding satisfaction.  Maybe satisfaction isn&#39;t really the most important thing.  Maybe the waste of a Ph.D.-trained person doing lower-level work is a waste whether they&#39;re satisfied or not.  Perhaps it&#39;s still mistreatment -- to return to one of my original stories -- even if the guy that the Party sent to do farm labor really is much happier tilling the fields.  I mean, I wouldn&#39;t keep from quitting his biology job to work on a farm if that&#39;s what he wanted to do because it made him happy.  But that&#39;s not what happened.</p></span>

<p>I&#39;m confused, Rich - or maybe just refusing to believe something I find off-putting. Do you really believe you can be scholastically overqualified to teach freshman composition? In your mind, what constitutes the <em>appropriate</em> training for such a teacher?</p></span>

<p>Wax Banks, a Ph. D. is supposed to teach you how to do something I&#39;ve been summarizing, perhaps incorrectly, as &quot;research&quot;.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s supposed to take so long and be so difficult: ideally, you are supposed to think of something that no one has previously thought of, and express that thought within whatever standards of rigor and communicability exist in your field.  Do you need to know how do that to teach freshman comp?  No.  Most freshman comp, in the U.S., is really remedial high school classes, and could be taught by an intelligent person with a college degree.  Otherwise they could probably use a Masters&#39;.</p></span>

<p>Ah, see, I was confused by your use of the term &quot;failed.&quot; Surely you can see that my point still stands. Maybe you don&#39;t want to do the lit teaching thin anymore or don&#39;t care either way, but it&#39;s far too soon to decide that it&#39;s never going to happen.</p>

<p>More later, but Rich, you&#39;re wrong about the division of academic labor. It&#39;s been thus for most of a century. The problem is not that their are fewer academic jobs; there are more of them than ever. The problem is that there are also more of those of us looking for them. There is also currently a crisis around public funding of higher ed, but that&#39;s an exacerbating condition rather than the base issue. Where is your narrative coming from?<br />

You&#39;ll get no argument from me on this count.&quot;</p>

<p>How strongly do you hold to this? Certainly not everyone who has limped their way through a post-grad degree is owed their job of choice. Nor under-grad, for that matter. Not all those who graduate from acting school get starring roles in films or on Broadway, either. Not everybody who attends basketball summer camps plays in the NBA, etc. To some extent any sort of training is a costly lottery; you buy the ticket, you take the ride. If you don&#39;t know your job prospects before you enter grad school, well that&#39;s hardly a structural problem.</p>

<p>Academia is a highly competitive world. If one doesn&#39;t get the job she expected, it could be because her work just wasn&#39;t impressive. Hopefully she, like you, can find meaningful work elsewhere. In any case she&#39;s hardly entitled to anything.</p></span>

<p><em>&quot;That never existed&quot; needs clarification -- those jobs once did exist, but they were taken away.</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s within the purview of the last four or five generations of people going into English, for whom such jobs only existed in theory---in particular, in the theory of the ever-expanding university.</p>

<p><em>Most freshman comp, in the U.S., is really remedial high school classes, and could be taught by an intelligent person with a college degree. </em></p>

<p>It&#39;s partly remedial when it comes to the writing component, but it&#39;s certainly not when it comes to the researching.  Once their writing reaches a certain level, we&#39;re teaching them how to do academic research, which is ideally something taught by people who have actually done some.</p>

<p>WKW:</p>

<p><em>If one doesn&#39;t get the job she expected, it could be because her work just wasn&#39;t impressive.</em></p>

<p>That suggests that there&#39;s some universally-accepted standard of impressiveness, when they&#39;re <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/you-dont-deserv.html" rel="nofollow">really</a>, and I mean <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/i-wont-deserve.html" rel="nofollow">really</a>, isn&#39;t.  We might not be owed jobs, but we can at least feel entitled to a less schizophrenic market that markets, you know, actual jobs.  It&#39;s not about getting the job of your choice, then, but of getting any job at all.</p></span>

<p>There&#39;s a point at which a quantitative change becomes a qualitative change.  If 1/3 of graduating Ph.D&#39;s aren&#39;t getting TT jobs, then sure, maybe the least impressive ones just aren&#39;t being as impressive.  But once it becomes a large majority of them, it&#39;s no longer a matter of competition within a functioning system.</p>

<p>These are all the standard excuses that people give to reconcile themselves and others to a dysfunctional system.  It&#39;s competition, and someone has to lose -- at least I&#39;m still better off than those other people -- I downgraded my job, but I found happiness.  That last one, as I&#39;ve repeatedly written but who knows whether some of you can read, is particularly pernicious because it&#39;s often true.  Simpler tasks are often more satisfying.  If the individual person is happy, great -- again as I wrote at the beginning, for people who can&#39;t read, it&#39;s always better to be happy than unhappy.  But once you start generalizing that, as Scott is doing here, it immediately has to become a devaluing of what came before.</p></span>

I can certainly see why &quot;blooming where you&#39;re planted&quot; and trying to make the best of things would be better for your soul, and your ulcers. </p>

<p>But maybe Scott learned, when he went to grad school, that he loved _teaching_, rather than teaching any _specific_ subject? Likewise for the researching --- he is co-writing a book and doing research on rhetoric and pedagogy stuff. </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t think so much that he&#39;s devaluing whet came before as learning both teaching literature and teaching comp provide him pleasure. </p>

<p>On the other hand, I can count way more than .06% jobs that Scott could have applied to, and then there are the job listings that split lit and comp as well. </p>

<p>Is it better to ruthlessly compete for one of those last jobs, or to Bartleby it and say &quot;I prefer not to?&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m always kinda stuck on the third option, because we&#39;ll need to eat and get money somehow while collectively advocating for social change. And I ain&#39;t joining a commune!</p></span>

<p>&quot;Then I realized something tremendously important: I was happy. I was teaching composition to freshmen and felt strongly gratified doing so. I wasn&#39;t teaching students abstruse theories about how literature works or arcane theories about how species evolved—I was teaching them the tools they need to interact with the world with a critical distance.&quot;</p>

<p>Look again at the sentence that &quot;tremendously important&quot; and &quot;strongly gratified&quot; ones lead up to. It&#39;s a compare-and-contrast. The material in Scott&#39;s field is abstruse and arcane, while freshman comp teaches tools people need. That&#39;s not devaluing? It&#39;s being developed into an argument: teaching literary theory to majors teaches them how to talk to literary scholars, while teaching freshman comp teaches critical life skills.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume that&#39;s all true. So what? When did teaching critical skills of general applicability to life to freshman become a higher academic value than teaching future scholars? It&#39;s only more important if what the scholars do really isn&#39;t that important. If what they do is abstruse, arcane, disconnected from anything.</p>

<p>And about the happiness thing. Sure, if something bad happens, it&#39;s always best to be happy in your new situation. Far better than being bitter. But if it involves denial that something bad happened -- complete with bits about how yes this would be mistreatment of someone else if they, unlike Scott, weren&#39;t happy with it -- that just reinforces all the routines of social denial that I see playing out in this thread.  The whole narrative around happiness in America is a corrupt narrative that isn&#39;t about actual happiness, it&#39;s about taking social forces and making them an individual responsibility.  Couldn&#39;t get a job because your field has no jobs?  If you are happy anyways, you&#39;re fine!  No harm has occurred.  If you aren&#39;t happy -- well then, you should get happy.  Not that Scott has said anything like that, but it&#39;s there, isn&#39;t it?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0128771de46c970c-content"><p>&quot;That suggests that there&#39;s some universally-accepted standard of impressiveness, when they&#39;re really, and I mean really, isn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p>I never said a universally-accepted standard. I should have said the opposite: impressiveness is in the eye of the beholder, which (yes) includes hiring committees. But again... how is this different from any other job? I once heard a hiring manager say that he preferred to hire B students from anonymous state schools rather than A students from Ivy schools. In his experience the B students worked harder and were more teachable. Yes, that&#39;s a bias, but are the Ivy kids somehow wronged by this or somehow entitled to a different sort of job market that favors their particular qualities? </p>

<p>&quot;We might not be owed jobs, but we can at least feel entitled to a less schizophrenic market that markets, you know, actual jobs. It&#39;s not about getting the job of your choice, then, but of getting any job at all.&quot;</p>

<p>Again, if someone doesn&#39;t do enough due diligence to know what the job market dynamics were like in her discipline before signing up for 5 or 7 years of grad school, then it&#39;s hard for me to have too much sympathy.</p>

<p>Not that it particularly matters, but I&#39;m currently a PhD student, although not in the humanities. I understand that hiring is a difficult and capricious process, and sometimes the breaks just don&#39;t go your way. Sometimes nobody will be hiring people who study financial regulatory regimes, as I do. Sometimes seemingly everyone will be. Sometimes people will be hiring Wyndham Lewis scholars, and sometimes they won&#39;t be. </p>

<p>But I also understood all that before I signed up for this. &quot;Luck&quot; or &quot;networking&quot; or &quot;being in the right place at the right time&quot; is a part of *every* job market, not just that for humanities professors. Sometimes it&#39;s really great to be coming onto the job market with a freshly-minted MBA from the University of Chicago. These days? Not so much. Do hiring committees have biases and histories and peculiarities? Sure, but so does the HR manager at your local Kinko&#39;s.</p>

<p>Do you agree? If so, what are you really complaining about? That the academic job market is too similar to other job markets?</p></span>

<p>It&#39;s differentiating, not devaluing.  I was never as gratified teaching literature surveys as I have been teaching composition.  A lot of that has to do with the program I&#39;m in---working beneath someone you respect enough to be co-authoring a book with is a joy---but a lot of it has to do with the simple fact that I&#39;m not sure what value there is in training people to be like me.  Why?  So they can go to grad school too?  It <em>killed</em> me that I had these brilliant students who&#39;d make brilliant colleagues, because I didn&#39;t want to encourage them to become so.  </p>

<p>WKW:</p>

<p><em>Do you agree? If so, what are you really complaining about? That the academic job market is too similar to other job markets?</em></p>

<p>I absolutely don&#39;t agree, at least not as it pertains to the MLA as a job market.  It might seem the same on the surface, but it isn&#39;t.  If I get a degree in computer science and respond to a job ad for a programmer, they&#39;re going to 1) narrow the field down to all the candidates who can perform the tasks that&#39;ll be required of them, then 2) evaluate them in terms of office politics, <em>i.e.</em> who they&#39;d think would make the best candidate.  The problem with MLA job ads is that they might claim to be looking for a programmer when they really want a janitor, but because they can&#39;t in good conscience hire a janitor, they have to pretend to want a programmer; but as long as they&#39;re hiring a programmer, they might as well hire the best one out there, only they won&#39;t tell anyone what programming languages they want this programmer to know, so the applicants must guess, pay $1,000 to fly and stay at the conference, then walk into the interview only to find out that although the hiring committee couldn&#39;t come out and say it, they really only wanted a janitor with expertise in a language they don&#39;t know.  Sorry!</p>

<p>Gas:</p>

<p>I changed course mid-stream their, so what should&#39;ve been they&#39;re ended up in some other sentence.  It happens, even to the best of us.</p></span>

They also expose students to different perspectives on the world they live in and train them in new methods for analyzing texts/discourses/arguements, both of which they can take with them into whatever career or life-course they pursue.  They also help students to, as the teaching goals statements put it, &quot;improve the quality of their verbal and written communication.&quot;  This doesn&#39;t make them better than or even, if it&#39;s done right, all that different from something like composition and rhetoric.  So let&#39;s not pretend that one is zen and the other motorcycle maintainance.</p>

<p>Dude, that&#39;s devaluing.  You even use &quot;value&quot; when you write about it.  If you don&#39;t want people to end up like you, I don&#39;t really know how much stronger a devaluing statement you can make.</p>

<p>You could say that you&#39;re criticizing the job market, not the work itself.  But really, not.  The whole thing is accompanied by a claim that teaching freshman comp teaches them critical skills which are useful to them in life, while teaching majors teaches them mostly how to talk to other people in the field, which is useless if they aren&#39;t going to work in the field.  That still means that it&#39;s useless.  Perhaps not intrinsically -- I haven&#39;t seen you write anything about how people should just give up doing literary studies -- but literary studies have been consigned to being an activity only useful within a professional context that no longer exists.  Like learning how to be an alchemist, say.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that anyone here really understands what I&#39;m trying to say.  Responses have ranged from totally moronic to polite-and-puzzled.  But really, I think your rhetoric does what I think it does.  It&#39;s understandable, and not too bad, but it&#39;s just not doing what you seem to think it&#39;s doing. </p></span>

<p>But saying I&#39;m not sure what value there is in training people to do what I can do isn&#39;t the same thing as saying there&#39;s no value to what I can do---it&#39;s simply an acknowledgment that I&#39;d rather not train people to do something that damn near ensures they&#39;ll be broke and unemployed if they follow through with it.  </p>

<p>It is odd that, for the most part, the people who are arguing for what you take to be the &quot;devaluing&quot; side are all literary scholars, whereas those who find merit in the practice and value in it as such aren&#39;t.  That&#39;s not to say you&#39;re not correct, as y&#39;all have a perspective that we obviously lack, but still, I don&#39;t think any of my &quot;us&quot; are devaluing the study of literature to the extent that you think we are.</p>

<p>In other words, it goes without saying that I think I have a skill, that I think I&#39;m an expert, but as a someone who also likes to eat, I can&#39;t in good conscience encourage others to acquire it.  Not because I don&#39;t value it, but because the market evidently doesn&#39;t.  It&#39;d rather reward those who [<em>insert whatever theory&#39;s trendiest at the moment</em>], and there&#39;s nothing I can do about that.</p></span>

My investment in that particular professional identity waned as the odds of its fruition faded, so I remade myself into someone who teaches literary journalism and spent a few years invested in a conception of myself as a candidate who could teach American literature and literary journalism, creative nonfiction, or whatever a particular institution called its program in the writing of things that belong in The New Yorker. But I still considered myself a future literary-critical professional and wrote things that indicated as much, e.g. most everything I wrote about literary theory. Not that my interest in those issues wasn't genuine, but the attention paid to them was commensurate to their foundational significance to an identity that, it became increasingly apparent, the market valued in name alone: the well-rounded literary scholar. After finishing the dissertation, I became that thing that no one wants to admit exists: the professional composition instructor. When tenured English faculty bother to note the existence of these poor souls, they speak to them as if their lives consist entirely of pain and wasted potential. As you might imagine, it is difficult to invest heavily in the identity that for years had functioned as an object lesson in professional failure. Had I focused on rhetoric and composition in my graduate work, I wouldn't have been in this situation, as my current position would have been an extension of my professional identity. But I didn't. To this day, I'm still not entirely comfortable in my professional skin, so much so that I have to trick myself into thinking I'm an adult by wearing slacks and dress shoes to class, shaving daily, and not punctuating my sentences with as much profanity as is my wont. All of which is only to say that as my expertise played an increasingly smaller role in what I taught, I began to feel ungrounded. I'd prepared myself to be a well-rounded literary scholar, but ended up a professional composition instructor. Then I realized something tremendously important: I was happy. I was teaching composition to freshmen and felt strongly gratified doing so. I wasn't teaching students abstruse theories about how literature works or arcane theories about how species evolved—I was teaching them the tools they need to interact with the world with a critical distance. Moreover, the online...</span></a></div>

You can tell he only watched the first half because he thinks the whole film is about Cuba—the second half, sometimes called Guerilla, covers events that took place in Bolivia and, more importantly, undercuts the romantic image of Che cultivated in The Argentine, the part of the film devoted to the Cuban revolution. Did Soderbergh omit the years between the Cuban and Bolivian insurgencies—years in which Che grossly mismanaged the Cuban economy, openly insulted the Soviet Union, and failed to exploit the revolutionary potential in the Congo? He did; however, he did so for narrative reasons, not political ones.Guerilla documents the abject failure of the great revolutionary to accomplish anything in the Bolivian wilds. Che and his dwindling forces spend the entire movie walking in circles—about an hour in, his forces are divided and compelled to walk in circles looking for each other, as if their mothers never told them that should they become separated from her at the mall, they should stay put and let her find them. The already leisurely pace of The Argentine slows to an appropriately Jarmuschian crawl, as it allows the viewer to realize that, as in Dead Man, the protagonist died in the first five minutes of the film and all this pointless wandering through desolate lands is designed to get him to understand as much. Anyone who watches the whole film would know this, but then again, no one who had paid attention to either half of the film would ever write: [I]n those two years of “ferocious” battles, the total casualties on BOTH sides actually ran to 182. New Orleans has an annual murder rate DOUBLE that. The famous “Battle of Santa Clara,” that Soderbergh depicts as a Caribbean Stalingrad, claimed five casualties total—on BOTH sides.I'm not touching the reference to New Orleans, and will instead focus on the author's claim that Soderbergh filmed this battle like &quot;a Caribbean Stalingrad,&quot; i.e. as the equivalent of a battle in which an estimated 2.7 million soldiers died, because nearly every casualty in Soderbergh's film was an established character. If anything, the film creates the impression that eleven of Che's closest friends were killed during the entire revolution. Then again, I'm not even sure why I'm paying any attention to someone who would write: Seems to me her tragic story makes ideal fodder for Oprah, for all those women’s magazines, for all those butch professorettes of “Women’s Studies,” for a Susan Sarandon or Sandra Bullock role.Because honestly, if you write the phrase &quot;butch professorettes,&quot; you're clearly confused as to what stereotype you're trying to convey: &quot;These masculine fairies, I mean, feminine meatheads, I mean—I mean—I mean.&quot; No sir, you mean no more than your words signify, and they're all sound and fury.</span></a></div>
