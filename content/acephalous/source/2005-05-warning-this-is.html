(In that sense, everyone’s affected by history, which is I think part of the reason for Jones’s wide social canvas. He’s less interested in special individuals than a whole society.) But you may need something like a racial soul to believe that you possess a history that is a special inheritance. That's a damn fine point, and I think he's right.

(11) That's the Short Version.* This argument hinges on the materiality of the text because, in the first case, you believe that the author of the intention is inscribed in every single copy of the text for anyone to interpret, but in the second, you value your experience with this particular copy of the text and you're the only one who can experience your experience. If this sounds like a strange argument to be making, it's because 1) it is and 2) Michaels is arguing against the position that every last dash, stroke, line and doodle in Emily Dickinson's notebooks is a part of her poems (and that if you only reproduce the words and dashes you're not reading the &quot;real&quot; poems).

<p>Even though thinking about books you haven't read often produces displays of rank stupidity, I've been thinking about Edward R. Jones' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060557559/qid=1117032087/sr=2-1/102-5180286-9483348?v=glance&amp;s=books"><em>The Known World</em></a> this afternoon and I've reached some damn damning conclusions about the conclusions Sean McCann draws from it <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/worlds_known_and_unknowable/">over yonder</a>.&nbsp; Not really.&nbsp; I'm loath to think too long about what I haven't read, so what I'm really talking about here is McCann's suggestion that <em>The Known World</em> chooses &quot;history over memory&quot; because</p><blockquote><p>emphasizing history will mean assuming that no one living in the

It’s true, of course, that you don’t have to assume a

which is I think part of the reason for Jones’s wide social
canvas. He’s less interested in special individuals than a whole
society.) But you may need something like a racial soul to believe that
you possess a history that is a special inheritance.</p></blockquote><p>That's a damn fine point, and I think he's right.&nbsp; He's building off what Walter Benn Michaels argued in the penultimate chapter of <em>The Shape of the Signifier</em>.&nbsp; In it, Michaels argues that ideas of &quot;special inheritance&quot; and the &quot;materiality of the signifier&quot; inevitably slide into identity politics.&nbsp; I'll tackle the more complicated, less convincing case first.&nbsp; What Michaels means by &quot;the materiality of the signifier&quot; is a De Manian commitment to the &quot;material vision&quot; of a text.&nbsp; The text becomes a thing, a series of physical marks readers don't interpret but experience.&nbsp; This focus on the experience of the readers leads, inevitably, to identity politics.&nbsp; Building on &quot;Against Theory,&quot; Michaels wants to prove that </p><blockquote><p>if you think the intention of the author is what counts, then you don't think the subject position of the reader matters, but if you don't think the intentions of the author is what counts, then the subject position of the reader is the only thing that matters. (11)</p></blockquote><p>That's the Short Version.*&nbsp; This argument hinges on the materiality of the text because, in the first case, you believe that the author of the intention is inscribed in every single copy of the text for anyone to interpret, but in the second, you value your experience with this particular copy of the text and you're the only one who can experience your experience.&nbsp; If this sounds like a strange argument to be making, it's because 1) it is and 2) Michaels is arguing against the position that every last dash, stroke, line and doodle in Emily Dickinson's notebooks is a part of her poems (and that if you only reproduce the words and dashes you're not reading the &quot;real&quot; poems).&nbsp; In other words, he's arguing against the De Manian position that all these marks &quot;count as part of the object...not because they are important to the 'purpose' of the object's maker but because--insofar as they are part of the object's 'sensuous appearance'--they are part of what the reader 'reads' or 'sees' without reference to the maker's purpose&quot; (6).&nbsp; One that necessarily individual experience is privileged, people can't disagree about what a poems mean; they can only discuss the different things it means to them.&nbsp; We can't argue about what it means because it doesn't mean anything, it's only experienced differently by people with different perspectives.&nbsp; And &quot;different perspectives&quot; means &quot;identity politics,&quot; because people with different subject positions &quot;can without disagreement give the same mark different meanings&quot; (66).&nbsp; </p>

<p>All well and good, I suppose, but I find the obverse more interesting: if you base your work on identitarian politics, you're necessarily talking about your experience with the materiality of the text, and must therefore admit that you've never known the world beyond your navel, must less said anything interesting about it.&nbsp; Which is where this ties in with the original conversation, because those who buy into identity politics are ones who want to privilege a supra-empirical knowledge of the past.&nbsp; The question stops being &quot;What does this History mean?&quot; and starts being &quot;How does this History make me feel?&quot;&nbsp; The problem with that, obviously, is that someone not only can decide to feel any way they damn well please about History, they can argue that because of who they are, they should get to be the ones who decide what it means.&nbsp; It's their special privilege, their culture, their Memory, and if you're not one of them, you can't say anything productive about it because it didn't happen to you.&nbsp; And by the implied &quot;happened to me&quot; they really mean &quot;happened to my ancestors, my culture, and living in my cultural Memory,&quot; you know, like slavery or the Holocaust.&nbsp; Michaels wants to divorce these claims, divorce History from Memory, because he believes that &quot;what we owe the victims of injustice is justice, not a causal account of how they came to be victimized&quot; (166).&nbsp; </p>

<p>So he disposes of the idea that we're haunted by the Ghosts of History and replaces it with one that relies not on identity but justice.&nbsp; I'm on board.&nbsp; But, but, but...</p>

<p>...I have trouble imagining what this world would be like, and I think that's the crux of the problem I have with Sean's argument.&nbsp; (Not to mention an excellent excuse to read <em>The Known World</em>.&nbsp; I still naively believe that literature expands my imaginative horizons.&nbsp; Reading Jones may help me imagine Michaels' vision of A World Without Identity Politics that doesn't involve jump-suits, unitards or uniformly shaved heads.)</p>
		</div>
					<a id="more"></a>
			<div class="entry-more">
				<p>*This is the Long One: Michaels wants to determine &quot;what a text is--what is in it and what isn't, what counts as part of it
and what doesn't--without the appeal to the author's intention.&nbsp; And
the point is that if you do this, you find yourself committed not only
to the materiality of the text but also, by way of that materiality, to
the subject position of the reader.&nbsp; You find yourself committed ot the
materiality of the text because, if you don't think it matters whether
the author of the text did or didn't intend [for example] eighty-six
blank pages to count as part of it, the mere fact that they are there
must be dispositive...Once, in other words, the eighty-six pages count
not because some author meant them to count but because they are there,
in front of you, then everything else that is there must also
count--the table the pages are on, the room that the table is in, the
way the pages, the table, and the room make you feel.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because
all these things are part of your experience of the pages, and once we
adjure interest in what the author intended (once we no longer care
whether or not the author intended us to count the room the work of art
is in as part of the work of art), we have no principled reason not to
count everything that's part of our experience as part of the work.&quot;</p>

<p>As I walked to class this morning I realized that one aspect of Michaels argument that bothers me is that he attacks materiality-of-the-signifier-ists and identity politicians on their own terms.  That&#39;d be akin to me debating creationists on their terms.  Sure, my biblical exegesis might be superior to theirs, but I&#39;ve still defended evolutionary theory on the basis of biblical exegesis.  That argumentative mode intends either to 1) convince people of the problems with their own arguments using the only evidence they&#39;ll accept or 2) mock the hypocrisy of the people you&#39;re debating.  Michaels intends both, I&#39;d wager, and he has a sound reason for doing so: the positions of the people he&#39;s debating are subtended by contradictory propositions and therefore ought to be discarded in favor of self-consistent ones.  As a political position, by which I mean, as a position on a matter of academic politics, I admire what Michaels&#39; accomplishes; but as a position on literary texts and on the interpretation (and, I&#39;m realizing, the production) of literary texts, I&#39;m not sure of its value.  (And this isn&#39;t because I love Faulkner.  Alright, maybe 37% because I love Faulker, 23% because I&#39;m a contrarian, and 40% because I&#39;m balking at the implications of Michaels&#39; argument.)</p>

<p>You&#39;re certainly right that Faulkner (and to a far, far lesser extent, Morrison) have won because their traumatic-birth-and-historical-or-cultural-continuity model has generated, well, the works of Faulkner and Morrison.  Because I haven&#39;t read Jones yet, I can&#39;t speak to its accomplishments, but here&#39;s a shot at what I think is behind my concerns: what&#39;s at issue in debates of History vs. Memory is really a matter of individual responsibility vs. collective trauma/guilt.  Individual responsibility can be historically compartmentalized, whereas collective trauma/guilt necessarily extends to all members of the collective, past, present and future.  In political terms, collective trauma/guilt subtends claims for slavery reparations; furthermore, it focuses attention on the sins of the past instead of the inequities of the present (and therefore botches the opportunity to hold contemporary individuals responsible for the actions that&#39;ve created/perpetuated these inequities).  I&#39;m with Michaels there.  I can see why the representation of this continuity in literature would also--if we grant culture this sort of formative power--have implications for politics at large, i.e. dispense with the idea of collective guilt on television and in books and movies and people might think differently.  But even though I grant culture the ability to shape thought thusly, I&#39;m not sure that sense of collective trauma and collective guilt could be eliminated.  Logically, and ideally, it should be; but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s possible.  Without saying that the capacity for this collectivist sense is hard-wired, I&#39;d say I strongly believe that it&#39;s a necessary by-product of how humans have and will continue to interact.  I realize I&#39;ve backed myself into a corner, because I not only can&#39;t explain why I strongly believe that, I&#39;m also well aware that I might only believe it <i>because</i> of the limitations imposed on my horizons by the cultural moment in which they&#39;ve been shaped.  And, of course, short of undertaking a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/082647697X/qid=1117217089/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-1563246-7465707?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" rel="nofollow">Gadamerian</a> intellectual history of the past 3,957 years, I can&#39;t responsibly refute that latter claim.  In short, I currently think that that is necessarily true, but I can&#39;t substantiate that claim.  I&#39;m more than willing to be talked out of trying, however...</p></span>

		<span id="comment-5932195-content"><p>Maybe collectivism can be explained by evolutionary psychology.  (Well, everything can be explained by evolutionary psychology.  That&#39;s the problem, right?)  But before going that route, or only that route, you&#39;d also want to consider other possible factors--social, economic, institutional, and, above all, political contexts.  Nine times out of ten, when we&#39;re talking about collective responsibility we&#39;re talking about state action and state compensation.  But to the extent that memory talk is (as it usually is) intensely psycholgistic, it usually doesn&#39;t have very useful ways of talking about state action.  </p>

<p>What I mean to say is that I&#39;m not at all averse to considering problems of collective responsibility and collective redress for historical injustice or injury.  (Trauma is another thing entirely.) I don&#39;t think being suspicious of trauma or inflated accounts of memory is necessarily inconsistent with that at all.  And, of course, being suspicious of them wouldn&#39;t mean you couldn&#39;t appreciate great novels, anymore than being suspicious of heroic virtue would mean that you couldn&#39;t appreciate, um, Icelandic sagas.</p>

Check out this article. I'll leave the legal analysis up to the experts, so this'll be short. Imagine you're a lawyer defending someone against charges of sexual molestation. Imagine you arrive in court to find that the person accusing your client has hired a new attorney. The plaintiff isn't wealthy. You're not worried. Then: In. Walks. Lawrence. Lessig. Imagine you shit your shorts. Imagine you look for somewhere to hide. Imagine you shit your shorts again when it's revealed that the plaintiff wasn't the only one molelsted by your client: So. Was. Lawrence. Lessig. Give 'em every last bit of what they deserve, Lawrence: Every. Last. Bit. EDIT: To those who emailed me saying this post was inappropriately glib, I want to say that 1) I understand where you're coming from, 2) I appreciate that you maintained a civil tone in your responses, but 3) my admiration for Lessig and his work compels me to think in these terms. I'm not making light of what he's had to suffer through; I'm expressing a grander social gratification that he's not only managed to survive it but is in a position to do something about it. Many people don't and aren't.</span></a></div>

Then on another blog the banner accused me of stalking him. I confessed, saying: Busted! When you check your counter again--T-minus thirty seconds and countin'--you'll see that since I've written this, I've reloaded your blog another 17 (SEVENTEEN!) times. Ten minutes from now, I'll have reloaded it another 37 (THIRTY-SEVEN!) times. Ten minutes from then, and you'll have another 101 (ONE HUNDRED AND ONE! OH MY!) reloads. On a Sunday morning (OH MY!). From my cell-phone. During services at Higher Heights Full Gospel Baptist Church Ministies. While being threatened with e-ternal damnation for my de-plorable de-pravities, my de-pletory de-precations, and don't you forget, my sons, nor you, my daughters, my de-testable de-pedence on the fruits of my bounty of sin (OH MY!)... &quot;It's unfathomable,&quot; you think, &quot;that anyone could believe that something other than the honest, heartfelt confession of a stalker.&quot; You're an idiot...but not alone. In response to the afore-linked post on my banishment, John Bruce graced my comments with some of his trademark &quot;apt and memorable locution,&quot; writing: Your little &quot;clique and claque&quot; routine might seem harmless to you, but I already got Jonathan Goodwin's Bradley Foundation summer grant frozen. Don't you remember what I wrote the other day? Don't mock me because 1) I've got a &quot;little man,&quot; 2) I don't &quot;get&quot; irony, or 3) I think boulet is the coolest word ever. If you want to mock me, do it because 1) my opinion of myself is so inflated I believe I could be responsible for Jonathan Goodwin losing his summer grant, 2) because I attack people for, among other things, &quot;mix[ing] UK and US spelling&quot; even though I mix UK and US rules on the correct placement of commas and periods relative to quotation marks--like I did in the very same post in which I criticized Miriam Jones for &quot;mix[ing] UK and US spelling,&quot; something I'd think ironic if I could identify irony when it isn't putting its boot to my neck, demanding I scream its name (and even sometimes when it is)--or 3) because I can't stop talking about how many hits I get, you know, because I spend hours watching that hit-counter click higher and higher, even though it's probably more people popping on by to have a laugh at my expense. Damn! His elocution is apt to the motherfuckin' memorable extreme. But today he dropped another apt and memorable elocutionary bomb. Check this shit out: Likewise, the frequent commenter on The Valve A. Cephalous had a similar reaction a couple of weeks ago -- same thing, 20 or 30 visits a day. Both the Linguistics prof and the Androgynous Cephalous would leave multiple furious comments on many posts -- it goes back to my suggestion that if someone's mad, maybe it's because someone else has a point. The A.Cephalous got so weird, it started posting with other people's names, and I...</span></a></div>
