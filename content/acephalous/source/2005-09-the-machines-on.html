CR implies that theory is as parasitic on the work of “serious scholars” as their work is on whatever unacknowledged theories subtend it.&nbsp; If that’s the case—if these categorical beasts are as beastly as I contend—then despite the horrendous boredom works of “serious scholarship” ostensibly entail,<a href="#1">[1]</a> without such work the quality of theoretical tinkering will decline.&nbsp; <em>The machine’s only as reliable as its cogs.</em>&nbsp; What disaster would befall the machinist who depends on cogs of talc!&nbsp; Springs all sprung but the talc cogs <em>have evaporated</em> and the machine, dear readers, the machine, its innards dusted with a fine coat of talc, grit for future gears.&nbsp; 

<em></em></p>

<p><em>Grit for future gears!</em>

</p>

<p>Given that any theoretical approach necessarily builds on these historical commonplaces, its fate is inextricably bound to the claims beneath the claims beneath its claims.&nbsp; If some of those are of dubious quality, then no matter how sophisticated or interesting the theoretical edifice built upon them, they fall with the foundation.&nbsp; 

Everywhere I turn I find foundations I wouldn’t even pitch a tent upon.&nbsp; (Much less build a house.)&nbsp; Since muddy foundations and putty cogs endanger all in equal measure, the call to continue pouring water on dirt from mixers made of talc seems to me the worst possible solution for all involved.&nbsp; </p>

<p>To put it another way (<em>back on the beat!</em>), the critical race theorist whose formulation of racialism involves a discussion of Social Darwinism in Gilded Age or Progressive America either 1) discovers the fact that Social Darwinism did not exist as advertised and adjusts his account to reflect more accurately the lineage of contemporary racial politics or 2) he never learns that Social Darwinism as advertised was a myth, never adjusts his account and, consequently, disseminates an inaccurate (and depending on the nature of the inaccuracy, potentially dangerous) account of race in contemporary America.&nbsp; &nbsp;

</p>

<p>One question I demand answered by all invested parties is whether what I’ve said here rings true or is 1) simply more evidence of my substantial historicist bias or 2) another example of the same empiricist logic behind my persnickety resistance to psychoanalysis.</p>

<p><a name="1">[1]</a>This argument, I should add, elides the fact that the writer’s as responsible for the quality of the work written as his or her approach, evidence or what-not.&nbsp; I can still sit down and read with enjoyment David Wallace’s <em>Chaucerian Polity</em>.&nbsp; We all feel this way about certain authors, as well.&nbsp; For example, I always find myself mesmerized by J.G. Ballard, but were you to describe to me the plot of <em>Concrete Island</em>, there’s little chance I’d be interested in reading it.</p>

		<span id="comment-9551558-content"><p>Hi Scott, I really agree with you. Maybe it&#39;s just me being cranky on an overworked saturday morning, after 4 weeks of not being to be a scholar because of my classes, but some of us actually study subjects that are shrouded by the past and which require philological and material reconstructions in order to be understood, interpreted and projected into more abstract models. Scholars who work on theory should work on theory. That&#39;s fine. But don&#39;t pretend to make historical statements that are unfounded. And I will stay out of high theory debates because that&#39;s not my specialty. This notion that everyone is an expert in everything or should be, or pretend to be, and have -tude about it, is a load of crap. I believe that literary critics who work on theory are rigorous and can do important work. Such theorists need to recognize that historicist literary scholarship also has its merits. We&#39;re not all the same. There&#39;s too much to know and examine from too many points of view. OK I have to go and wipe up some cat vomit now. I mean it. I&#39;m not being creative when I say that. My cat just puked.</p></span>

<p>My question is - where are the grand claim makers? Where did they disappear to? The dustiness is all well and good (even if it&#39;s not my thing - and I overstate that a bit for effect on the Valve) - but what doesn&#39;t it all add up to if it emerges as the sole sanctioned activity... </p>

		<span id="comment-9566934-content"><p>Cam, </p>

<p>You capture in this sentence what I danced around in my post: <i>Some of us actually study subjects that are shrouded by the past and which require philological and material reconstructions in order to be understood, interpreted and projected into more abstract models.</i>  I feel like valuable work, theoretical or otherwise, cannot be done without careful attention paid to the context in which a work&#39;s written and read.  The latter is especially important if one plans to theorize a work&#39;s continued and future significance.  </p>

<p>CR,</p>

<p><i>My question is - where are the grand claim makers? Where did they disappear to?</i></p>

<p>I think there&#39;s an absence of the kind of synthetic superstars--those who dance from Freud to Nietzsche to Hegel and back again--who ruled days past, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a dearth of ideas, or that the work currently being done isn&#39;t considered by those who do theory to be of critical importance.  I think what we&#39;re seeing isn&#39;t the result of less celebrity aspirants so much as less celebrity-enthralled audiences.  The Lacanians have split from the Foucauldians in ways that make critics who appeal to both thinkers suspect to both audiences.  The fact that, say, I didn&#39;t see many of the faces familiar to me from Derrida&#39;s seminars at Zizek&#39;s lectures indicates that, on some level, theory has specialized in ways that make the kind of thinkers whose absence you lament difficult to both produce and disseminate.</p>

<p><i>And who gets to determine who picks nits and who gets to shout?</i></p>

<p>We do, of course.  When I came to UCI, I came here to &quot;do theory&quot; and study Joyce.  I chose to do otherwise, to become the foot stool of future theorists, and I don&#39;t regret the decision.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-9569550-content"><p>I think (vs. CR) that the distinction between &quot;grand claim makers&quot; and &quot;library workers&quot; is spurious.  Good theory is good scholarship - i.e., it draws general conclusions (relevant for a wide variety of other researchers) from careful combing of an archive of materials.  Bad theory, by contrast, is also bad scholarship - i.e., general conclusions floating alone with nothing to support them.</p>

<p>The relevant class distinction should instead be between good scholarship that is broad, and good scholarship that is narrow.  The former synthesizes a broader range of materials and is thus relevant to more researchers - think, for example of John Guillory&#39;s Cultural Capital or Michael McKeon&#39;s The Origins of the English Novel.  Not everyone has the energy or ability to produce this kind of work.</p></span>

Sometime that evening, Mrs. Selinger (a dear friend and frequent alibi of Mrs. Stenberg) informed the young adulterers of her encounter with a “Hindoo.” He threatened exposure, she said, though not in those words. The previous November, the Los Angeles Times had editorialized Jack’s divorce: “The Times suggests that the incident will serve well enough to call attention to the fact that the public is inclined to look more leniently on divorces where alleged ‘geniuses’ are concerned.” Now Jack knew the public will not look leniently on another divorce. He knew that this time it will frown on him “the same as upon all others who put themselves outside the pale of decency by reprehensible actions.” And what, Jack thought, what about Mr. Stenberg, branded a cuckold in boldface from Sacramento to New York City. He might respond with a reprehensible action of his own. “Pay the Hindoo what he wants,” Jack said. Months later, London explained his actions to a friend: “There’s no use getting them into trouble with their husbands, even if they are rattle-brained.” Later that same January night, at a meeting of the New York Educational Alliance, London entranced another sympathetic crowd with talk of the lucky cave man. “He Didn’t Have to Ask for the Right to Work,” read the byline the next morning. “If he woke up hungry he picked up his club and sallied forth.” London glanced down. He had first delivered this diatribe the previous March on the banks of the Sacramento River. He continued: “He was able, more or less, to satisfy his hunger. There was nobody between him and his work.” The Hindoo wanted too much. He wrote London every month. The letters were unsigned, but the Hindoo was unconcerned. Jack would know who he is. London continued to work. He completed Before Adam. On June 9, he mailed George Sterling the manuscript. “It’s just a skit, ridiculously true, preposterously real.” London implored him to “jump on it.” “I guess you know the thing’s pretty punk,” was Sterling’s reply, “or you’d not suggest that I roast it.” The Hindoo played both sides. He persecuted Mrs. Stenberg on Jack’s behalf, and London on Mrs. Stenberg’s or Mrs. Selinger’s. (Possibly his own.) His actions confused London, who no longer understood to whom he was beholden. He wrote Mrs. Stenberg: Now I am writing to you for information. I am the real Jack London. I don’t know you. I don’t know the Hindoo. I don’t know Mrs. Stenberg, much less love her. Was this all a concoction of yours, or did you really know some fellow who claimed that he was Jack London? Four days after finishing Before Adam, on June 14, 1906, London informed Elwyn Hoffman that “I undoubtedly have a double impersonating me.” In a letter written around the same time to A.L. Babcock, the...</span></a></div>

Or a drunk. (Different, as souvenir shirts once scattered across Southern Louisiana—mostly in the French Quarter but available everywhere come Fat Tuesday—different, that is, from alcoholics because drunks don't go to meetings.) Speaking of drunks, I like to drink. Because I'm a graduate student. And a drunk. But not an alcoholic. How do I know? Back when I had cancer and couldn't drink for fear of interfering with the chemo, it came to my attention that while I enjoy unwinding in the evening with a drink (or two or three or enough shots to send me bending for a fortnight), I hadn't reached the point where I needed a drink to unwind. Now maybe there's a stage in the writing process during which all dissertators drink a little more than they should or safely handle. If there is I haven't reached it. Because I can drink prodigious amounts of alcohol and feel nary a thing. To wit: This evening I've recreated a wonderful concoction named something like a Double Super Sucker Nipple Twister. It consists of Pineapple juice, Malibu Pineapple Rum and Jagermeister. Yes, Jagermeister. I know many of you will scoff when I say that my favorite mixed drink consists in part of a liquor reputed to contain the blood of Bambi's mother. I suffer this embarrassment not because of the blood of Bambi's mother, who according to Whit Stilman is responsible for the modern environmental movement, but because Jagermeister's the shot of choice amongst &quot;shot connoisseurs&quot; like all of these incredibly refined folk. (All of whom were found, I feel it necessary to add, by a Google image search for &quot;Jagermeister.&quot; That such drunken revelry appears at the very mention of the drink's name should be damning. Should, I say, should. Not is. Bear with me.) So I have my cocktail, and it contains Jagermeister, and I have similar cocktails on a fairly regular basis. Or I have since I've kicked the cancer and worked in earnest on my dissertation. (Not that I wasn't working on it when I had cancer. I was. Only I wasn't working on it so well, what with the insomia and nausea and wanting to cry like a spoiled child all the time.) But I digress. From my digression. From this digression in a digressive post that people will undoubtedly think Jagermeister responsible for. Well, &quot;people,&quot; I said I recreated a cocktail. I haven't started drinking it yet—and even if I had, my tolerance is so manly at this point that I could've downed a couple of shots of Jager, peirced my ears, stuck some clasps through them, attached said clasps to a keg of Jager and walked around some nondescript stage like that guy in that photo I've already linked to. I'm that manly. (Or...</span></a></div>
