<p>I don't need to speak to your supervisor <em>thank you very much.&nbsp; </em>But
I would like an answer.&nbsp; Because you know what I think?&nbsp; Your addiction
to torture porn has become so all-consuming it now encompasses its
opposite: reverse torture porn.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For almost six years, you've drifted off to sleep play-acting Jack
Bauer.&nbsp; A dark foreigner planted a ticking bomb in a Major American
City and only you can discover its location before millions die.&nbsp; You
tumesce at first thought of the necessary force this mission requires. 
Which method will you use?&nbsp; You weigh the pros and cons of all the law
allows, but the bomb is ticking, so you consider those it forbids.&nbsp; You
delight in cataloging the sadistic acts the situation necessitates. 
Your decision made, you apply the screws, water, electricity, heat,
cold, Manilow, &amp;c.&nbsp; You save America.&nbsp; You are a hero.&nbsp; Men want to
be you, women to be with you.&nbsp; You fall asleep.</p>

<p>But just as legal coercion lost its luster, so too have the
techniques implemented outside the law.&nbsp; You can do no more harm to these imagined
bodies without imagining yourself a murderer, so you shift from the
torturer to the tortured.&nbsp; Where before the tortured man made war upon
America, in John McCain, mind and body are broken in its service.&nbsp; Your
heart swells with pride when you consider his sacrifice.&nbsp; Your beloved
car battery acquires menace, as the means by which you once saved
America nightly becomes the means by which they would have you betray
it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You are now addicted to reverse torture porn, and John McCain is
your enabler.&nbsp; You are incapable of thinking about politics outside
a primal scene of human suffering.&nbsp; You shape your policy in rooms
whose walls perspire, on improvised furniture carelessly shat on a
bloodstained concrete floor, and you ignore the damnable hypocrisy of
it all.**&nbsp; Whatever McCain learned in a hole like this qualifies him to
lead the free world.&nbsp; We teach terrorists something different. </p>

<p>What exactly?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; You don't either.&nbsp; But it's
categorically different than what McCain learned, whatever that was;
and whatever that was, it is now a quality desired in a President; and
because whatever it is, Obama lacks it, McCain is the better
candidate.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I think that about covers it.</p>

<hr /><p>

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">*The comparison doesn't work because, as Clark himself
said: &quot;Barack is not—he is not running on the fact that he has made
these national security pronouncements. He's running on his other
strengths. He's running on the strengths of character, on the strengths
of his communication skills, on the strengths of his judgment—and those
are qualities that we seek in our national leadership.&quot;&nbsp; <br /></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">**Overwritten, certainly, but considering I initially
wrote &quot;walls perspire fungal rot,&quot; you should be thankful I somehow
managed to rein myself in.</span></p>

Wesley put forward a perfectly good one and the least you can do is acknowledge it I think. Experience shapes leadership and wisdom but more importantly in this context it informs <i>character</i>. McCain&#39;s experience as a POW was really unpleasant and involved extensive dental work after. However it impacted the guy he is now is unknowable, but no less real for that. Baracky&#39;s bad experience is he&#39;s just mad cause he never had no daddy. In terms of compare and contrast, I think McCain&#39;s experience probably informs his views on national security and military issues every but as much as Baracky&#39;s does.</p></span>

<p>This is, IMHO, just like the preemptive (sorry, I know how you hate preemption) playing of the race card by Obama before a single McCain commercial has hit the air. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s entirely relevant to the situation, but it has something to do with the resonances the writing touches off at the moment. </p>

<p>The best I can say about military experience -- POW time being part and parcel of it, in many ways -- as furher-bildung (and I just mean that in the sense of &quot;leader&quot;; just because it&#39;s German doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a Nazi reference!) is that dealing with the military and paramilitary is a significant (much more so lately, it seems) part of the job, and the active experience of it should give the erstwhile candidate both some empathy for the people under their command (though they have many more civil servants in that category, they rarely send them into dangerous situations, except for IRS agents) and some communicative and leadership skills which will ease that relationship somewhat. </p>

<p>But after a while that expires and it&#39;s overshadowed by policy, character, allies, etc.</p></span>

<p>I would think that reverse torture porn has a much longer history in representational culture, going back at least to the WWII German interrogation scenarios of the 1950s.  Withstanding the worst that the enemy can throw at you nicely combines American notions of masculinity with Christian martyrdom fantasies.  It&#39;d be interesting to set something roughly coeval like <i>Alias</i> against <i>24</i>, in terms of representation of torture.</p></span>

Tacky, yes; but probably also true.  It seems like people are worked up by the idea of McCain&#39;s military service somehow being denigrated, even if Clark actually has a reasonable point.</p>

		<span id="comment-122188456-content"><p>Three qualifications:  First, leadership is an executive quality.  John McCain demonstrated leadership in his conduct as a prisoner and also as the commander of a US Navy training squadron after the Vietnam War.</p>

<p>Secondly, I would argue that quality of character is an executive quality.  When the executive makes a promise or signs up to a policy we need to have faith that he will stand by his promise.  John McCain&#39;s conduct while a prisoner of war demonstrate quality of character in spades.  He had the opportunity to be sent home early, but seeing that it would give propaganda points to the enemy he refused, sticking to the agreement that POWs would be released in the order of capture, meaning Everett Alvarez should have been the first to be released.  McCain remained true to his country and to his fellow POWs.</p>

<p>Sen. Obama, on the other hand, has demonstrated he will stand by no one.  He started off by throwing his grandmother under the bus to perform damage control regarding Rev. Wright.  When he began to lose political support he threw Rev. Wright under the bus.</p>

<p>Third, moral courage.  John McCain demonstrated moral courage throughout his ordeal as a prisoner of war.</p>

<p>Others&#39; mileage may vary.</p>

First in the foremost if you are stimulated by new ideas because you are the kind of person like me and you can think for yourself rather than simply accept what Obama says as ultimate truth I think you will find this post importantly of interest to you. I guess I should start by saying that what Obama thinks is not what he says and even what he says he thinks only provides cover for an incoherent agenda of sorts. Even if we overlook the logistical impossibilities of such ideas as the ones Obama has profligated the underlying premise of all of them is flawed and you can tell this is the ontological truth of the matter because of the insults he employs like raucous scoundrel and pugnacious. But if you look soberly and carefully at the evidence all around you on the television you will obviously see Obama's grandisonant effusions are not pedantic treatises expressing theories or extravaganzas dealing in fables or fancies they are substantial sober outpouring from the very soul of demagogism. Now stay with me for a moment here because I am making a point. Specifically that there may be nothing we can do to prevent Obama from making good on his word to destabilize and undermine the already volatile social fabric he purportedly aims to save. When we compare this disturbing conclusions I have drawn from the premises presented we can only conclude that the comforting picture purveyed by his conspirators and feel what is called by experts cognitive dissonance from it. Our only recourse is to kick ass and take down names. If his attempts to perpetuate what we all know is a corrupt system have spurred us to challenge his uncouth libidinous assumptions about merit then Obama may have accomplished a useful thing because if we are to set our sights on eternity then we must be guided by a healthy and progressive ideology not by the salacious ornithological ideologies Obama promotes. It is possible that Obama does not realize this because he has been imbibed by so much of the propaganda of quislingism and if that is the case as I believe it to be then I tremulantly recommend we halt the malmish adulation heaped upon wretched misfits. If anything Obama has hair in his brain and even though we all are to some extent as hairy Obama sets the bar on the curve that much higher up the mountain.
