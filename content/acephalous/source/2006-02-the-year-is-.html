<p>The year is . . . some year in Eighties.&nbsp; A tired old man watches a presidential news conference:</p><blockquote><p><strong>President: </strong>Now it's taken some doing—<br /><strong>Old Man: </strong>Yeah, some <em>doing.</em>&nbsp; Like repealing the Bill of Rights.<br /><strong>President: </strong>—but we have arrived.&nbsp; We are at <em>peace</em>—<br /><strong>Old Man: </strong>Of <em>course </em>we're at <em>peace</em>!&nbsp; We've<em> killed </em>just about everybody who disagrees with us!<br /><strong>President: </strong>—our <em>children </em>live in a world free of crime—<br /><strong>Old Man: </strong>Our <em>children </em>live in a damn <em>police state</em>!<br /><strong>President: </strong>—we are prosperous beyond the <em>dreams </em>of previous generations—<br /><strong>Old Man: </strong>We're well-paid <em>slaves</em>.&nbsp; WHO WILL STOP ALL THIS.</p>

<p>Thinking about the complicated interaction of myth and politics depicted therein forced my fourteen year old brain to consider a picture more realistic than the superheroes-fight-supervillains and larger than vigilante-fights-petty-crime.&nbsp; Sure I could've waited a few years and read Umberto Eco on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F025320318X%2F">Superman</a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" /> as defender of property rights and all things <em>status quo</em>.&nbsp; But because of that graphic novel I didn't need to.&nbsp; </p>

<p>So needless to say I felt profoundly disturbed when I learned that Frank Miller had nearly finished &quot;a piece of propaganda&quot; in which &quot;Batman kicks Al Qaeda's ass.&quot;&nbsp; The man who <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/superman.jpg">aligned Superman with Reagan foreign policy</a> has decided to align Batman with Bush's?&nbsp; (Click on that link even if you don't read comic books.&nbsp; It's about as brilliant a panel-to-panel progression as you're likely to see.)&nbsp; <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/004546.htm">Conservatives</a> <a href="http://brainster.blogspot.com/2006_02_12_brainster_archive.html#113985914760313518">danced</a> <a href="http://www.rightwingnews.com/archives/week_2006_02_12.PHP#005207">in</a> <a href="http://www.ridingsun.com/posts/1139909991.shtml">the</a> <a href="http://www.rightwingnews.com/comments.php?id=5207">street</a>.&nbsp; But consider their logic:</p>

<p>If Batman attacks al Qaeda then Miller must've turned Dennis Miller's corner.&nbsp; He must now believe in the conservative way of life because . . . no liberal would approve of a vigilante going to Afghanistan and finding and fighting Bin Laden.&nbsp; Now I have no idea whether Miller will reverse the symbolism of the above panel and align Batman with The War President and The Global Struggle Against Extremism . . . but isn't it strange that conservatives can't imagine how Miller sending Batman to Afghanistan might constitute a <em>criticism </em>of the current administration?&nbsp; How can they be sure the book won't be an indictment?&nbsp; Because he called it &quot;propaganda&quot;?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Maybe they're right.&nbsp; Maybe Miller's desire to depict Batman fighting the war Bush claims to be winning will be a ringing endorsement of the President's policy.&nbsp; Maybe Olsen's words about saving &quot;the children&quot; via genocide and wage slavery will resonate in patriotic young hearts across America.&nbsp; Or maybe they don't understand how complicated a message sending an unstable vigilante to fight a war we claim to be winning might be.&nbsp; Miller has betrayed an awareness of nuance in the past . . . but so had Hitchens.&nbsp; There's no point in barking about a book that hasn't been finished yet.&nbsp; I understand that.&nbsp; But the conservative cheerleading of Miller's decision convinces me that their ideology has robbed them of their imagination.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Consider Miller's example: &quot;Superman punched out Hitler. So did Captain America. That's one of the things they're there for.&quot;&nbsp; <em>Superman </em>and <em>Captain America </em>punched Hitler.&nbsp; We know how Miller once felt about Superman.&nbsp; (<em>Click on <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/superman.jpg">that link</a>!</em>)&nbsp; And Captain America?&nbsp; Can you think of a more subtle propagandistic vehicle?&nbsp; The problem is that vocal conservatives can't seem to think outside the most basic political binaries.&nbsp; Anyone familiar with Miller's thought would know that he's about as <em>libertarian </em>as they come.&nbsp; His affection for Batman—a vigilante who thinks wealthy private individuals can do better than Big Government when it comes to issues like fighting petty crime and climbing buildings in kevlar tights—should tell them something.&nbsp; Or they can read some of his diatribes against political correctness in which he says things like: </p><blockquote><p>The most palpable threat to free speech these days comes from the
secular political left.&nbsp; Janet Reno, Paul Simon, all those little
'politically correct' fascists that haunt our universities, preaching
that the purpose of fiction is not entertainment, but rather
indoctrination.&nbsp; These shameless, lying, whiny scumbag baby boomer,
sixties-generation spoiled brats who think they serve society by
rewriting history and trying to unravel our language . . . they represent a
much more effective and successful effort to shut down free speech and
the free press than the Bible-bangers ever have.</p></blockquote><p>I don't agree with those sentiments <em>but I recognize them</em>.&nbsp; They're textbook post-adolescent <em>libertarian</em> rage.&nbsp; <em>Textbook</em>.&nbsp; (I would continue but then I'd have to think about Ayn Rand.)&nbsp; In closing I will quote (without comment) some other conservative responses to Miller's decision:</p>

				<blockquote><p>[<em>All of these statements can be found in one of the links above.</em>&nbsp; <em>I would point to the irony in the people's inability to understand the logic of a vigilante but that would be too easy.&nbsp; Most of my responses to them would fall into that same category.&nbsp; Which is why I present them 'without comment.'</em>]</p>

<p>&quot;I think comic books should be forbidden by law from depicting the
president, or, if they're going with a fictional president,
specifically referring to him as a Republican or Democrat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Watch libs get angry Batman abuses &amp; oppreses people whom are just
fighting to be freed from the evil American military-perto-industiral-capitalist complex serving the expansionist
needs of an evil empire. Besides, Batman is too macho. Until he and
Spiderman do a Brokeback style movie they are bad for libs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've been daydreaming lately about Kratos from (God of War) going to
Iraq and showing those terrorist scum what REAL brutality is . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can only hope that Miller doesn't phone it in near the end of this 'Holy Terror' and turn Batman into an apologetic rat who 'recognizes
diversity and celebrates a person's right to exist.' To me, that's not
Batman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Dark Knight Stomps a Mudhole In Bin Laden's Ass.&nbsp; Opening scene - Batman is beating the shit out of Pinch Sulzburger.
Frank Rich and Paul Krugman are already in Arkham Asylum after a good
beat down. Maureen Dowd just gets a good scaring. Batman doesn't hit
chicks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Scene 2: Batman runs over Robert Fisk with the Batmobile, then
repeatedly drives back and forth over him as Fisk explains why Batman
is justified in doing so. Hillary Clinton locates a hidden stockpile of
Smylex in Syria and plans to use it to prop up her sagging
protruberances . . . and poll numbers!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;SUPERMAN PUNCHING BIN LADEN SPIDERMAN SOCKING WARD CHURCHILL WONDER
WOMAN USING HER MAGIC LASO ON CINDY SHEEHAN AQUAMAN TURNING SOME
DOLPHINS LOSE ON SOME GREENPEACE WACKOS&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;[Superman] also grabbed Stalin as well and dragged them back to Geneva,
Switzerland to stand trial in front of the League of Nations.&nbsp; Damn, I wish America was like it was back then; even if we have a new
comic like that -- and I sure would love to see it and don't
underestimate its worth; will it ever be as popular? I sure hope so.
Its true that country music is still popular like that, but we do need
more of that good honest American wisdom and pride.&nbsp; Its just so sad when the left say that we are jingoistic for caring
about the freedom in America and hating and proudly fighting the true
enemies of freedom such as Stalin, al Qaeda and Hugo Chavez/Castro.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;IRONMAN beats the crap out of all of AL QUEDA THE AVENGERS take on the
insergents the DEFENDERS are out to see what they can do with the
radicals and sgt FURYS HOWLIN COMMANDOS will play havoc with the
suicide bombers and HUGO CHEVEZ&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>Brainster, that&#39;s what I get for revising.  (I&#39;ll try to keep that to a minimum in the future.)  But yes, the more recent works haven&#39;t met his high standards.</p>

<p>Gaijin Biker, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m <i>over</i>- so much as simply analyzing it.  Speculating, actually, since I haven&#39;t read it.  And your second point, about the relative merits of AQ not being a hot-button political issue, was partly my point.  Why, then, was the conservative reaction to think that liberals would necessarily hate this book.  </p>

<p>Rich, I&#39;ll read it, post about it, then I&#39;ll expect your volume on my desk first thing tomorrow morning.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-14044653-content"><p>Did I ever tell you that when I was 14, I won the Ayn Rand Essay contest and became one of the youngest members of the Objectivist Society?  (never mind the cognitive dissonance that at the time, my life was saved by Medicare) I left at 16 after I became disillusioned with her philosophy--no space for altruism, welfare, anything charitable.  Now I argue for affirmative action, civil rights, universal healthcare, and non-absolute free speech. People would call me a left-wing commie pinko fag hag! How one evolves! (or Ayn would say, &quot;devolve&quot;)</p>

<p>My brother was really, really into comic books, so I absorbed some of that.  But I never knew this about Frank Miller. What an eye opener.</p>

<p>Also, although I would not risk imputing it to gender differences, my favorite comics are about anti-heroes, sad sacks, and losers.

<p>I feel sorry for objectivists, I really do, they want to do philosophy ( at least some of them) so that&#39;s why it&#39;s sad that they don&#39;t really understand the problem of induction, why it is incoherent to found logic on observation, why it is almost certainly incoherent to found mathematics on observation, why the is-ought gap is not so easily crossed, why there is a sense/ reference distinction etc etc.</p></span>

<p>&quot;&quot;Snow?&quot; she asks. She brushes at her shoulder. Reason quickly informs her that it is snow.</p>

<p>&quot;And, why,&quot; she says, &quot;a lamp post!&quot;</p>

<p>The lamp post shines like a monument to industry.&quot;</p>

<p>From <a href="http://rebecca.hitherby.com/archives/000491.php" rel="nofollow">Hitherby Dragons</a>, of course.</p>

<p>Actually, probably my favorite part is:</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;I do not do this thing,&quot; rumbles Aslan, &quot;because you are unworthy and small. You are not. I do not do this thing to save an evil land. It is not. I do this because Narnia is good. I do this because you are good. I do this because you are worth this to me. Because in a world that seems very dark I will prove to you that you are worthy of my life.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>After which the kids debate whether Aslan is coming back from the dead, and Susan asks why they&#39;re waiting around.  </p>

<p>&quot;&quot;Because Aslan is Aslan,&quot; says Peter. &quot;A is A.&quot;&quot;</p></span>

		<span id="comment-14304998-content"><p>I&#39;ve been meaning to read The Dark Knight Returns for a while, not because I&#39;m specifically a Batman or Miller fan but because I&#39;m a comics fan in general, and maybe Batman vs. Al Qaeda will inspire me to do it. </p>

<p>But I have to make a revision to this. <br />
<i>I don&#39;t see how you can prejudge the tenor of Miller&#39;s Batman Does Kabul until you see it. My guess: everyone will get skewered to some extent; smart people will recognize that they got hit and object; dumb ones will notice where the opposition got hit and celebrate....</i></p>

<p>No, more like dumb right-wingers will notice where the opposition got hit and celebrate, dumb left-wingers will notice where they got hit (or the opposition got praised) and object, and smart people will enjoy it based on their personal tastes and whatever value it might or might not have as art.</p>

<p>I&#39;m reminded of &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, how a left-wing friend of mine refused to see it for months because he had heard about a reactionary slant, and then he saw it and was amazed at how all the villains were greedy bastards and arch-capitalists. Or reactionaries eager to find a political message in &quot;Serenity&quot;, never mind that in &quot;Firefly&quot; economic injustice was at least as important as political oppression. At least no one is dumb enough to be bothered by the pro-monarchy messages of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;.</p>

<p>Some art and media lends itself to simple and clear political interpretations. But there&#39;s a lot that doesn&#39;t, or has political themes but no actual messages, or where the political messages are part of the narrative rather than being proscriptive. So barring endorsements or straightforward public statements by Miller, I&#39;ll go out of my way to avoid finding partisan politics in <i>Batman Does Kabul</i>.</p></span>

Just so you know. 'Cause I set high standards for posts around here. I like them to be freestanding and am disappointed when they seem otherwise. And so I have banished it below the fold . . . where it will frolic in fields of flowers with all your beloved dead pets.] N. Pepperell of Rough Theory points to her desire to engage in gender-neutral online debates as one of the reasons she doesn't post under her full name. I should begin by noting that I hadn't realized she was a woman despite her having commented here fairly frequently over the past few months . . . but neither did I assume her a man. Be gentle, dear readers, as I blunder through this minefield: the operative question here is how I could have failed to notice the import of gender entirely. The answer? If someone's name fails to mark their gender it doesn't pique my curiosity. I'm more interested in what &quot;entities&quot; have to say than in communicating with them as people. Not that I don't acknowledge them as human beings, mind you, because I do. But online all the identitarian benchmarks can fall to the wayside without damaging the intensity of intellectual interaction. Like Pepperell, I would prefer my words not be implicated in the masculinist discourse I've taken pains to remove myself from elsewhere. And that's what trips up so much online communication. Because I've done what I've done elsewhere and previously instead of always here and immediately, I leave myself open to charges that I'm ignoring what I've failed to explicate here. This is why I'm such a devoted bridge-builder. WHAT? YOU? A BRIDGE-BUILDER! Yes. (Stop laughing.) I am. (I really am.) A bridge-builder. (Don't make me turn this car around.) Despite the fact that my posts on the Valve tend to generate more comments than any post which doesn't include the word &quot;Zizek&quot; in it, none of the principle combatants considers me anti-intellectual or unnecessarily hostile. (I can provide definitive proof of this but am satisfied to let the statement stand and have Matt, LB, CR, Ken Rufo, &amp;c. waiting in the wings in case anyone doubts me on this one.) Despite regularly ruffling everyone's feathers I have somehow maintained my integrity and popularity. The reason, I believe, is that I confront arguments instead of people and proffer counter-arguments instead of attacks. I don't think this an inherently masculine or feminine so much as an acquired trait. I've trained myself to respond in such a way that the compact that is &quot;the benefit of the doubt&quot; is never broken no matter how heated the debate becomes. (Speaking of which: I've been grading and grading and grading all day . . . and so may need a heartier benefit of a greater doubt than is typical.) Belle (if I may) notes that seriously blogging transforms fun into work. I don't think that's quite right. The thing about studying...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/few_would_dispu.html"><span><strong>Herr Loves a Good Joke . . . er.  (Groan.)</strong> Few would dispute the claim that Michael Herr's Dispatches stands somewhere near the summit of journalistic achievement. You have your Capote boosters , your Mitchell partisans and your rabid Joan Didion fans . . . but even they would admit that while Herr lacks their beloved's body of work, Dispatches alone earns Herr the right to be mentioned in the same breath. Unless you ask Herr, who now insists that Dispatches is a novel with all the trappings one expects from fiction in which the author writes &quot;what he knows.&quot; The vivid characters are composites, the dramatic moments were invented &amp;c. I'm tempted to dismiss his claims to having invented these characters as part of what had been (before the memoir craze of recent years) a structural bias against the literariness of literary journalists, the best of whom only filter the brilliance of others. Who wants to filter genius? More to the point: Who can't? Anyone can filter. Only geniuses are geniuses. Such seems the reasoning behind Herr's '80s argument and his subsequent struggle to have Dispatches declared fiction. I don't buy it. My main objection is that it dehumanizes the grunts he lived with in Vietnam. My secondary one is that it suggests that Vietnam couldn't do to kids what everyone knows it did. Some of the more sensational scenes in Dispatches do seem invented . . . but so do commonplace accounts of daily life during the Vietnam War. In short: Herr wants credit for what historical context created. I don't want to give it to him. At least not for Dispatches. But I'll give it up for Full Metal Jacket . &quot;Wasn't Full Metal Jacket was based on Gustav Hasford's The Short-Timers?&quot; I admit: The first half of the fim was lifted verbatim from &quot;The Spirit of the Bayonet&quot; section. But the second half of the film contains numerous reworkings of material from Dispatches and, more importantly, doesn't end with Cowboy's death like &quot;Grunts&quot; did. The novel concludes with Joker killing Cowboy after he's been mortally injured by a sniper. Then they return to base. In the film the Lusthog squad tracks down the sniper. Rafterman shoots her down . . . but let me step back and let the ironies compound. In the screenplay for the film Herr creates a composite of Hasford's &quot;Joker&quot; and Michael-Herr-working-journalist-in-Vietnam. Hasford's Joker is a combat correspondent like Herr . . . only Joker went through BT and is actually a Marine. Herr was a combat correspondent for Esquire. But when Herr adapted Hasford's novel he had Joker experience much of what Herr did and wrote about in Dispatches. He grafted Dispatches onto The Short-Timers. Thus we see Dispatches' most memorable dialogue crop up in Full Metal Jacket. To wit: DOORGUNNER: Anyone who runs is a V.C. Anyone who stands still is a well-disciplined V.C. You guys oughtta do a story about me sometime. JOKER: Why should we do a story about you? DOORGUNNER: 'Cause I'm so fucking good! That ain't...</span></a></div>
