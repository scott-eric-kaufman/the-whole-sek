<p>* I hate using the term &quot;camp&quot; in this context, as it implies both natural fun and impermanence, neither of which are appropriate. </p></span>

<p>I am sure the entire Jewish community appreciates your fine points and distinctions between the concentration camps and the work camps.  I take it the lucky jews got sent to the work camps to die while the unlucky jews got sent to the concentration camps to die.  Thanks for clarifying it.</p></span>

(Or, possibly, an explanation as to why I really can't.) Sadly, this is my strongest chapter, the one that should be my writing sample and/or job talk, but I'm thinking I should go with something else, like the one in which I prattle on about a fish. Crap. I'm never going to land a job, am I?</span></a></div>

Remarkable. Think of the most clever pun you've ever read. Now multiply it by numbers. I imagine the author at work, staring at the blank screen, until suddenly, from nowhere, The Muse assaults him with an unthinking ferocity unknown outside legend and hyperbole. Unblinking, he longs longingly at his creation, his only wish that he could experience its birth again. The decision between slashes and parenthesis lingers in his loins. He feels the tingle spread as he remembers how gently he unpressed his shift and brought that slash to life. On the brink! It had been on the brink! For a moment the subtle curves of the parentheses had seduced him, but as he withdrew his pinkie he knew he had chosen wisely. In his loins. He knew in his loins he had chosen wisely. Like countless dead dinosaurs compressed in a diamond, his pun condensed his brilliance into sharp translucence. No one could encounter his pun and fail to acknowledge the awesomeness of the mind responsible for it. So he walked into the bathroom and beat off. THE END</span></a></div>
