<p>In news whose normally noxious effects on my sanity may have been mitigated by the surprising arrival of the Spring Quarter I present the lowlights of this week's Academic Calls For Papers (CFP) Puns Division:</p>

<li>roots/routes</li></ul>

<p>General stupidities include:</p>

<ul><li>&quot;Integration and Fragmentation affect every aspect of contemporary life and academic activity...What kind of activities are integrating, which are fragmenting; and what manner of strategies might bring these issues together.&quot;</li>

<li>&quot;While much critical attention has been given to the disiplinary moves which have created the student body in education, the significance of teachers' bodies remains central to the production of knowledge...For this special edition we seek articles that examine this problematic through the signification of the teacher's body and the spaces in which teachers perform their identities.&nbsp; Teaching as performance implies an audience...We are looking for smart, lively essays that examine the construction of the teacher's body inside and outside the spaces of schooling...as well as the performances that are required of teachers to maintain their status as (in)visible containers of knowledge.&quot;</li></ul>

		<span id="comment-4646300-content"><p>See, now /this/ is the kind of blog entry you should write more often. Spittle-flecked, bug-eyed with rage, this close to shooting a man (and by a man, I mean a coworker) just to see him die.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the more familiar I become with the jargon of the race-gender-class crowd, the more I think it&#39;s not only similar to, but serves the same /function/ as, Sovietese-- that distinctive, malformed, and deadly dull language you&#39;ll find in anything produced by the Communist bloc. And I&#39;m almost /certain/ that was a run-on sentence. Anyway, if you&#39;re not familiar with Sovietese, you have only to read even a tiny bit of Soviet history and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll spot the parallel on your very first encounter with it.</p>

<p>It f&#39;ing /killed/ the Russian language, too-- particularly Russian literature. I&#39;m just sayin&#39;.*</p>

<p>* Actually, in fairness-- hah, fairness-- the &quot;socalist realism&quot; school of art and literature, memorably summed up as &quot;boy meets tractor,&quot; is what killed Russian literature. But since the Party decided that socialist realism was the only acceptable form of art, because it was supposed to help advance the cause of the proletariat, whereas art for art&#39;s sake was simply a decadent bourgoise conceit (yes, they really thought like that); and since the end result, once the state&#39;s organs of censorship were in place (Organs of Censorship would be an /excellent/ name for a rock band), was a distinctive brand of Soviet &quot;literature&quot; just as cloying, dull, and heavy-handed as anything you&#39;d read in Pravda, what I said was true in spirit. Also, I suspect this footnote will be longer than the rest of the post combined. Good times.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-4646728-content"><p>Wait, crap. That post is horribly unclear, I fearinate. (&quot;Fearinate?&quot; &quot;Fearinate. I also fearify.&quot; &quot;You frighten me.&quot;) So let me clarify.</p>

<p>When I referred to race-gender-class jargon serving the same function as Sovietese, I didn&#39;t mean that it was supposed to &quot;advance the cause of the proletariat&quot; (although I&#39;m sure its authors think they&#39;re helping oppressed masses); rather, what I meat was that it&#39;s designed to comfort and reassure the faithful while at the same time /not provoking any thought/ about the faith itself. </p>

<p>Of course, there are some differences between the two. The Soviet system had the advantage of education on its side-- that is to say, small children were taught in school that the class struggle is an international struggle, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, solidarity with the proletariat, ultimate triumph of the workingman over the exploitative capitalists, from each according to his abilities and to each according to his needs. It would be extremely difficult to grow up in the Soviet Union and /not/ believe in the fundamental underpinnings of the Sovietese, no matter how deadly-dull and thick-tongued the phrasing was. Whereas a Soviet child was taught from a very early age that Marxism-Leninism was incontrovertible scientific fact, most Americans pass through a happy childhood without hearing anybody say &quot;genderracial.&quot;</p>

<p>On the other hand, this particular jargon has advantages that Sovietese didn&#39;t. For instance, if all you freaking read in the paper every goddamn day is &quot;the Soviet economy is constantly overfulfilling the quotas set forth in the Five-Year Plan,&quot; and yet there are shortages of /everything/, you&#39;ll develop a healthy skepticism towards the claim that the Five-Year Plan is in fact being overfulfilled; indeed, you&#39;ll rather doubt it&#39;s being fulfilled at all. On the other hand, for the good folks who come up with terms like &quot;genderracial,&quot; there /are/ no barren store shelves to confront them with their emptiness; they can therefore trundle contentedly along, secure, despite all common sense and evidence, in the unshakeable conviction that someone, somewhere, believes that they aren&#39;t full of it.</p>

<p>Ah, vitriol. I do enjoy it so: yet it appears I have said everything I wanted to. The hour is advanced, near 3 AM: and so to bed.</p></span>

I refuse to be bested so lightly, so I present to you some books A. Cephalous has never read: Hawthorne's The Marble Faun: One of the few books I abandoned while in the middle of the penultimate chapter. I trudged through 454 pages and emerged with first-degree purplings over 91% of my body: &quot;You have an advantage over me! I am no true creature of the woods; while you are a real Faun, I do believe. When your curls shook, just now, methought I had a peep at the pointed ears!&quot; However, having read Megan Marshall's article on Hawthorne's treatment of Elizabeth Peabody in this week's New Yorker, I'm more than willing to hike the well-manicured gently gradient path to the moral high ground occupied by Cornell West, John Carlos Rowe, Eric Cheyfitz, etc. and declare my disapproval of Hawthorne's behavior reason enough to avoid reading anything he wrote ever again. Frank Harris' The Bomb: Atop the stack of books I must read on pain of painful death stares Harris' fictional account of the Haymarket riots. Necessary to my dissertation? Certainly. Riddled with so many egregious typographical errors as to make some of my students' hasty &quot;efforts&quot; look carefully edited ? Absolutely. Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff: I teach literary journalism. I teach the research skills necessary to write the interior monologues for which Wolfe is so famous. But I haven't read anything he's written since 1979 except The Bonfire of the Vanities and a couple of chapters of I am Charlotte Simmons. Am I a fraud? Because I feel like a fraud... I'm stopping here. Any further and those gnawing doubts would feast on my insecurities...before asking the waiter to doggy-bag what's left.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/03/cfp_transgender.html"><span><strong>CFP: Transgendered Trans/Portation: &quot;The El Word&quot;</strong> The inimitable David followed his early morning scorching of Soviet Realism with a screed I present untranslated, unaltered and unadulterated: Speaking of, are Some Gay Guy and Some Guy one and the same? (I mean the folks leaving comments on your blog; no grand, sweeping comment on society and sexuality was implied. Normally I wouldn't need to say that, but you spend all day surrounded by people who say things like &quot;queering &quot; and really mean it. Any day now your English department will hold a conference on queering public transport systems. The keynote speaker will ask the provocative question, &quot;Are city buses gendered, and if so, does that imply the existence of /trans/gendered city buses? What radical, transgressive artists have addressed the plight of transgendered city buses in their work?&quot; Then he'd be interrupted when half the audience walked out in protest, because by discussing city buses, he was marginalizing schoolbuses and even subway trains. Then my fucking head would explode from the sheer pointlessness and, if there was any justice, so would all of theirs.) -- Anyway, if Some Gay Guy and Some Guy are indeed one and the same, would you pass on my sincere compliments on his /unbelievable/ laziness, per the &quot;Things I haven't read&quot; thread? I'm so tempted to write a CFP for a panel on &quot;Transgendered Trans/Portation: 'The El Word.'&quot; It'd look like this: CFP: Transgendered Trans/Portation: &quot;The El Word&quot; In multiple locations, activists and scholars are currently mapping the intersections of queer theory and public transportation. Recent years have seen an efflorescence of queer work on &quot;the gaze&quot; as a site of resistance for queer and transgendered commuters. Papers should explore how this gaze implicates voyeurs and exhibitionists in power dynamics and interrogate the dynamics these looking relations entail and cultivate. Topics may include: An analysis of gazing queerly, Queer gazes, gazes in queer spaces. The interuption of the transgendered gaze by ruffled newspapers, staring out the window, moving to the other side of the bus. Performativity of transgendered identity and its relation to the gazes of bewildered old widows who lost children in Korea and Vietnam and who wish this once they could get to Macy's and back without a counter-hegemonic force invading her personal space. Looking at &quot;Others&quot; as a tool of identity construction. Conversely the psychological effect of the gaze of the other. The ways in which specific theories of transgendered spectatorship affect interactions between characters in the text. The specular relationship between the reader and characters in books cleverly marketed as &quot;subway fare.&quot; Disrupting the gaze: fragmentized narratives of missed stops, appointments and opportunities for radical performances of transgendered identities before captive audiences in buses/trams/subways/airplanes. Transcontinental performances of transgendered identities. You know what's really sad? I could go all night. Jesus Creeping Shit!</span></a></div>
