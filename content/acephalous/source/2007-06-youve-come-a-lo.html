		<span id="comment-73497990-content"><p>Michael McKeon&#39;s last book had a section on privacy and hallways.</p>

<p>Regarding Wharton, it&#39;s interesting that Henry James also bemoans the loss of privacy in the NYC section of *The American Scene*.  I remember two particulars: (a) the grid arrangement of NYC streets, which afford no little nooks or crannies like the English Muffin of London streets; and (b) the glaring public-ness of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.  He also bemoans the lack of men in High Society.  In America, the socialite is stuck with women, because all the men are socially inept business types off making money at all hours of the day.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re stuck in public with women.  Clearly, not Henry James&#39;s dream.</p></span>

I have a difficult time dealing with interfaces seemingly designed to frustrate both the subject doing the interfacing and the object being interfaced. I can barely read it, and half the time I turn a page, the next one never loads. It seems both Scott and the Server are unhappy. I'm this close to moving on entirely, despite the fact that the discussions of &quot;conditions&quot; and &quot;conditioning&quot; in the book seem perfectly geared to my topic. Does the book not know I only have nine days to finish this chapter? Does it not realize that I'm only futzing with it because the copy I interlibrary-loaned four weeks ago still hasn't arrived? Does it not care?</span></a></div>

People keep telling me this. It must be true. So I beg of you, please immediately forward the following email to everyone in your address book: Dear My Dear Friends, You must understand that I would not send this email unless I had good reason, and as you have known me for a very long time you know I am not someone who sends emails like this without good reason. My good reason today is my friend I met over The Internet who has a name and it is Acephalous. He is a nice boy who had cancer and got hit by a car but now he has no head and it is very serious and it does not look like he will make it without YOUR HELP. Bill Gates who is a GREAT MAN sent him an email and in it he wrote that if ONE MILLION people clicked on the site of Acephalous that he would buy him a new head made of computers and parts so he can live a good life again. So please click on THIS LINK as hard as you can and pray all the time every day and then forward this email to everyone in your address book and maybe you can help a suffering young little child to have a new computer parts head to replace the one he lost to cancer and being hit by the car and pain.</span></a></div>
