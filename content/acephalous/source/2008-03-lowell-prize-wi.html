		<span id="comment-106425262-content"><p>I thought it was hilarious, and dead-on. SEK is right: humanities articles are never withdrawn, retracted, amended, or corrected, allowing bad information and absurd theories to live on in the literature forever (and its even worse now with digital archives dragging this stuff back up). There was a period in the 60s and 70s when historians attempted to apply the ideas of Freud and Jung to historical biographies and social phenomenon -- we called it psychohistory -- which produced some of the most embarassing stuff, thought it&#39;s still cited in some venues. There are more recent attempts to apply much better social psychology and cognitive theory, post-Freudian developmental psychology, etc, which is very promising in the development of family history, children&#39;s history, etc., but nobody calls it psychohistory any more, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Alfred North Whitehead said that &quot;Learning preserves the errors of the past as well as its wisdom. For this reason dictionaries are public dangers, although they are necessities.&quot; </p></span>

		<span id="comment-106426912-content"><p>It&#39;s fascinating how quick we are to turn SEK&#39;s piece of farce into something that can be paraphrased: he is &quot;right&quot; or he is &quot;saying&quot; something. Not that I don&#39;t do the same thing, let me quickly put in, but the humor seems to be getting lost in the translation, what E.B. White said about dissecting a frog (you can dissect frogs and jokes, but both tend to die on the process). The piece is funny because the humanities don&#39;t work the same way as the sciences, and the absurdity of treating them as if they do is just FUNNY. But that humor isn&#39;t reducible. It&#39;s funny for contradictory reasons: first that the humanities necessarily can&#39;t correct their own mistakes (and can therefore be mocked), but *also* that this is a good thing (the virtue of the methodology is that nothing is proven).</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/03/i-generally-aga.html"><span><strong>Retract the Humanities: No, I Despise It Despite How Often It's Been Cited</strong> I generally oppose explaining jokes, but when genuinely bright people miss the point, evidence points to me missing the mark. An article in which someone argues that repressed negrophilia motivates the actions of Ben Cameron in The Clansman would be unspeakably stupid. (I thought the caption to the accompanying photograph would've made that plain.) Dixon is admirably frank about his intentions: &quot;The Clansman&quot; is the second book of a series of historical novels planned on the Race Conflict ... [It] develops the true story of the &quot;Ku Klux Klan Conspiracy,&quot; which overturned the Reconstruction regime ... How the young South, led by the reincarnated souls of the Clansmen of Old Scotland, went forth under this cover and against overwhelming odds, daring exile, imprisonment, and a felon's death, and saved the life of a people, forms one of the most dramatic chapters in the history of the Aryan race. Early in the novel, Austin Stoneman presents President Lincoln with the following argument: The life of our party demands that the Negro be given the ballot and made the ruler of the South. This can be done only by the extermination of its landed aristocracy, that their mothers shall not breed another race of traitors ... Nature, at times, blot out whole communities and races that obstruct progress. Such is the political genius of these people that, unless you make the Negro the ruler, the South will yet reconquer the North and undo the work of this war. The Southerners may have been defeated, but their stock is as hale as their minds are sharp. If not put to the Negro's boot, Anderson argues, the South will rise again. He quickly learns the gravity of his error, and by novel's end he entreats the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan thus: My will alone forged the chains of Negro rule ... When I first fell a victim to the wiles of the yellow vampire who kept my house, I dreamed of lifting her to my level. And when I felt myself sinking into the black abyss of animalism, I, whose soul had learned the pathway of the stars and held high converse with the great spirits of the ages— At which point he is interrupted. The plot thickens until Stoneman feels compelled to declare: The Klan!—The Klan! No? Yes! It's true—glory to God, they've saved my boy! The novel ends with the Grand Dragons of six states wiring in election results so favorable Cameron announces That Civilization has been saved, and the South redeemed from shame. THE END In short, The Clansman is so profoundly racist it precludes even the cleverest of scholars from reading against its grain. Any theoretical model allowing for such a reading would be invalidated by its ability to allow for such a reading. Granted, an article claiming Dixon's novel is structured by Cameron's repressed negrophilia should never have been published in the first place. But were one to slip past the gatekeepers, it would be out...</span></a></div>
