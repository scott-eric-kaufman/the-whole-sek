			<p>In the midst of the sunshine there stood an old manor house
that had a deep moat around it. In this wilderness of leaves, which
was as dense as the forests itself, a duck sat on her nest,
hatching her ducklings. At last the eggshells began to crack.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&quot;Peep, peep!&quot; said the little things, as all the ducklings but one poked out their heads.&nbsp; The duck looked at the intact egg.&nbsp; &quot;It takes a long time with that one egg,&quot; said the duck on
the nest. &quot;It won't crack, but look at the others. They are
the cutest little ducklings I've ever seen. They look
exactly like their father, the wretch! He hasn't come to
see me at all.&quot;</p>

<p>The summer months passed.&nbsp; At last the big egg did crack. &quot;Peep,&quot; said the young one,
and out he tumbled, but he was so big and ugly.</p>

<p>The duck took a look at him. &quot;That's a frightfully big
duckling,&quot; she said. &quot;He doesn't look the least like the
others. Into the water he shall go, even if I have to
shove him in myself.&quot;</p>

<p>So off went the duckling. He swam on the water, and dived
down in it, but still he was slighted by every living creature
because of his ugliness.</p>
<p>Autumn came on. The leaves in the forest turned yellow and
brown. The wind took them and whirled them about. The heavens
looked cold as the low clouds hung heavy with snow and hail. It made one shiver to think of it. Pity the
poor little duckling!</p>

<p>Then from the thicket before him came three lovely white swans.
They ruffled their feathers and swam lightly in the stream. The
duckling recognized these noble creatures, and a strange feeling
of sadness came upon him.</p>
<p>&quot;I shall fly near these royal birds, and they will peck me
to bits because I, who am so very ugly, dare to go near them. But
I don't care. Better be killed by them than to be nipped by
the ducks, pecked by the hens, kicked about by the hen-yard girl,
or suffer such misery in winter.&quot;</p>
<p>So he flew into the water and swam toward the splendid
swans. They saw him, and swept down upon him with their rustling
feathers raised. &quot;Kill me!&quot; said the poor creature, and he bowed
his head down over the water to wait for death. But what did he
see there, mirrored in the clear stream? He beheld his own image,
and it was no longer the reflection of a clumsy, dirty, gray
bird, ugly and offensive. He himself was a swan! Being born in a
duck yard does not matter, if only you are hatched from a
swan's egg.</p>

<p>Alright, I know I should stand up for my (current) school, but is Tulane still a college baseball powerhouse?  Because I remember them billing the LSU/Tulane games as the Civil War back in the &#39;90s.  Unless, of course, it&#39;s just a matter of a racist Southerner ... which, having lived in the South, wouldn&#39;t surprise me in the least.</p>

<p>FOR THE RECORD: My mother posted that comment without having watched the video.  I doubt her warm fuzzies would&#39;ve been quite as stoked if she had.  That said, it&#39;s nice to know I&#39;m like Edith Wharton, as I&#39;ve got twelve pages in that chapter about her making things up by &quot;reading&quot; books before she&#39;d learned to read.</p>

<p><em>Please don&#39;t make this a metaphor about grad school. Please?</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s not!  It&#39;s what happens when I&#39;m still awake at 5:00 a.m. and flip through <em>National Geographic</em> online -- this sort of thing Just Makes Sense.</p></span>

My dream began and ended with me prostrate and paralyzed on an unkempt dirt floor. I've never had a dream half so dull or claustrophobic before. For uncountable hours I spit up the turf I'd otherwise inhale. The tang of organic compost permeated my every thought ... all of which were hummed to this tune, causing me to wonder whether I wasn't dreamily demanding you recognize me. I float on! Float on! Because I'm William Blake: Don't you know my poetry?* *If this post makes no sense, it's only because I couldn't find video of the closing scenes of Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man. Why did I fail? Because Johnny Depp thought it'd be a good idea to star in another movie prominently featuring the words &quot;dead&quot; and &quot;man&quot; in the title, thereby rendering Google more useless than useless.</span></a></div>
