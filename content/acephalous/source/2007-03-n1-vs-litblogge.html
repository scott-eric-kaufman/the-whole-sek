<p>The lit-blogging community is positively apoplectic about the latest <a href="http://www.nplusonemag.com/"><em>n+1</em></a>.&nbsp; In “The Intellectual Situation,” <a href="http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2007/02/the_intemperate.html#comments">you’ll recall</a>, the editors write:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The blogs salved this ennui and created nourishing microcommunities. Yet criticism as an art didn’t survive. People <em>might</em> have used their blogs to post the best they could think or say. They <em>could</em>

satifsfaction—&quot;The Divine Comedy is SOOO GOOOD!&quot;—or displeasure—&quot;I shit
on Dante!” So man hands information on to man.</p></blockquote>
<p>
The pace of the contemporary moment is ruinous.&nbsp; Who has time to
develop an opinion anymore?&nbsp; We must choose between the obvious and <em>la critique trouvé</em>. 
The former wins little readership; the latter, a devoted following. 
Canny appreciation will win a blogger an audience—earn him entrance
into the nourishing microcommunity of his choosing—but the quality of
his thought will suffer.&nbsp; He will repeat himself repeating others and
be praised for it.&nbsp; But it’s not like the editors of <em>n+1</em> won’t begrudge such coteries the solace of companionship.&nbsp; As Keith Gessen writes in <a href="http://marksarvas.blogs.com/elegvar/2007/03/the_n1_letters__1.html">an email Mark Sarvas posted</a>:
</p><blockquote><p>It’s just a different model of magazine. As you say, Eliot’s <em>Criterion</em>, where he published <em>The Waste Land</em>, or something like <em>Partisan Review</em>
(those guys published their own poetry!), are places where the editors
had things they wanted to say that they believed no one else was
saying. Irving Howe’s <em>Dissent</em>. Herzen’s <em>Bell</em>. Dwight Macdonald’s <em>Politics</em>. Sartre’s <em>Les Temps Modernes</em>.
The other model is curatorial: you’re throwing a creative writing
contest and whoever wins the contest gets published. That’s the <em>New American Review</em> or the <em>Paris Review</em>—or
the thousand magazines associated with MFA programs. They’re both valid
models, but obviously we’re working in the first one.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Most of those—especially those publishing the work of the New York
Intellectuals—are coterie work.&nbsp; When judging it, you take into account
the intellectual environment that produced it.&nbsp; You look for the shared
ideological, intellectual and personal assumptions of the group of
people writing for a particular venue and you adjust your assessment
accordingly.&nbsp; To rail against <em>n+1</em>
for treating a self-sustaining intellectual community as a single
entity is a general complaint, one easily recognizable to you folk if I
substitute “theorists” for “lit-bloggers.” You can, <a href="http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2007/02/are_we_who_you_.html">like Jodi</a>,
consider any such effort inherently dismissive, but much of what I’ve
learned earning my Book of the Month Club degree says otherwise.&nbsp; The
issue is <em>always</em> thornily general; complaints about the inaccuracy of the generalization <em>always</em> miss the point ... <em>especially</em> when they validate the generalization in the same breath they deny its explanatory power.
</p>
<p>
Take Sarvas.&nbsp; He should be shamed for publishing private
correspondence, but he should be mocked for publishing it because
Gessen, Marco Roth <em>et al</em>
had to gall to point out that “lit-bloggers [have] become a
self-sustaining community, minutemen ready to rise up in defense of
their niches.” The pettiness behind his decision to publish Gessen’s
emails proves the editors of <em>n+1</em> correct: some lit-bloggers do turn bellicose when their authority’s questioned.&nbsp; Garth Risk Hallberg’s <a href="http://www.themillionsblog.com/2007/03/love-burning-thing.html">considered rebuttals</a> on <a href="http://www.themillionsblog.com/">The Millions</a> work to refute the generalization, but the <a href="http://www.themillionsblog.com/2007/03/keepers-of-flame-reply-to-n1.html#comments">comments and links to his post</a> contains more of the same:
</p>
<blockquote><p>You think I’m small-minded?&nbsp; I’ll show you.&nbsp; <em>I’ll publish your private correspondence.</em>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Teach you to call me petty.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Or consider Edward Champion’s <a href="http://www.edrants.com/?p=5653">biting response</a> to the claim that lit-bloggers “represent a perfection of the outsourcing ethos of capitalism”:
</p>
<blockquote><p>[insert author name]’s [latest book from author] has hit
bookstores. It’s criminally underated, and [reviewer who writes
somewhat intelligently or has interesting take] has an interesting take
on why it’s worth your time.
</p>
<p>Last night, I had a [vaguely personal moment in which I don’t reveal
too much of myself to readers, because, based on some of the comments
here, I think a few of you are keeping extremely close track of my
personal life—for what reason I have no idea]. And it reminded me of
[article which probably has nothing to do with moment in question].
</p>
<p>And I would be remiss if I didn’t mention [A friend or acquaintance
who has done something interesting, must keep this near the end to
avoid favoritism]’s thoughtful project, which should blow the lid on
[incongruous reference here because I’m overworked and I need more
coffee so that I can stay awake, until such moment as I will be able to
properly collapse].</p></blockquote>
<p>
As withering self-deprecation goes, Champion’s performance is
brilliant; unfortunately, it also proves the very point he wanted to
refute.&nbsp; In real sense, Champion and other lit-bloggers <em>are</em> vehicles for information about literature, not organs (<em>ahem</em>, <em>ahem</em>) devoted to its study.&nbsp; Which is <em>fine</em>.&nbsp; I read Champion <em>because</em>
he has his ear to the ground.&nbsp; He does a phenomenonal job tracking
trends in contemporary literature.&nbsp; (I find his book reviews a little
too mainstream for my taste, but their failings are exemplary of the
form, not the individual.) Perhaps unfairly, <em>n+1</em> castigated
the lit-bloggers for not being something they aren’t trying to be; but
the editors do have a point about the lack of speculative gusto, or
more mundanely, the poor reading skills of many in the lit-blogging
community.
</p>
<p>
You see, my biggest complaint about the lit-blogger’s response <em>n+1</em> is that it simply <em>misses the point</em>.&nbsp; The entire “Intellectual Situation” is a meditation on the relation of speed and technology to the cultivation of thought:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The true mood of the form is spontaneity, alacrity—the
right time to reply to a message is right away. But do that and your
life is gone.</p></blockquote>
<p>
As with email, so too with cellphones and blogs.&nbsp; The dearth of analytic vim in <em>any</em>
blogging community is not necessarily the fault of the individuals
comprising it, but a symptom of the temptations of the genre.&nbsp; It <em>is </em>tempting to write book-chat.&nbsp; It <em>is</em> tempting to turn a blog into group therapy.&nbsp; It <em>is</em> tempting to post the same sort of fluff found in <em>Slate</em>.&nbsp; It <em>is</em>
tempting to link to the same YouTube video everyone else has.&nbsp; Unless
you consciously fight it, the inertia of generic norms will exert its
influence on you ... and your blog’ll be the worse for it.&nbsp; That
lit-blogs are singled out speaks to their potential—to the potential of
people who are still devoted readers—to bring to their blogging the
same spirit of resistance they demonstrate every time they choose to
read instead of write an email, use their cellphone, or turn on their
Wii.</p>

<p>As my <a href="http://www.pseudopodium.org/ht-20070213.html#2007-02-17" rel="nofollow">my own</a> positively apoplectic response attempted to point out: And so too with new intellectual print journals. It <i>is</i> tempting to simply repeat the past-arm&#39;s-length put-downs we read two years ago in the <i>NYTBR</i> and environs.</p>

<p>Whether your vanity publishing&#39;s serialized online and cheap or offline and expensive, you&#39;ll find it easier (and more rewarding, for many ideas of &quot;reward&quot;) to give commonplaces a snappy gloss than to take the risk of research, engagement, and original thought. I can&#39;t deny the comfort &quot;the same sort of fluff&quot; brings to most writers, most readers, and most prospective employers. But when fluff-wallowing appears in &quot;places where the editors had things they wanted to say that they believed no one else was saying,&quot; I suspect the editors have gone wrong, either in meeting their goal or in stating it.</p>

<p>(Now, if <i>n+1</i> had asked <i>Turbulent Velvet</i> or <i>John Latta</i> to insult literary blogs, they might really have had something worth reading.)<br />

		<span id="comment-63570976-content"><p>Ray, in one draft of that post, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>Ray already addressed the <a href="http://www.pseudopodium.org/ht-20070213.html#2007-02-17" rel="nofollow">unflattering gamesmanship</a> in the first paragraph, so I will focus my attention on the...</blockquote>

<p>But I couldn&#39;t finish the sentence elegantly, so out it went.  I think you&#39;re being a little too hard on the editors here, however.  What they&#39;re saying in &quot;The Intellectual Situation&quot; isn&#39;t new -- Milan Kundera wrote a book about it a few years back -- but that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t worth saying (or repeating, whatever the case may be).  Hell, I can&#39;t count the number of times I&#39;ve been in the library reading some &quot;revolutionary&quot; account of something or other and had to stifle the urge to cough &quot;Kenneth Burke&quot; into my hands (for my own amusement, of course).  </p>

<p>The mention of the <em>Baffler</em> brings back fond memories of my undergraduate years, when I&#39;d sit in the bookstore reading back numbers for hours and hours.  (True story: I didn&#39;t realize that my advisor was an editor for it until well after I&#39;d hitched my wagon to his star.  Sometimes, I like to pretend that I somehow knew all along.)</p>

<p>If <em>n+1</em> had asked Turbulent Velvet to write <em>anything</em>, I&#39;d probably unsubscribe.  His is the kind of intellectual posturing we could all do without.  </p>

<p>Marydell, you&#39;re certainly correct, but there is a representational logic at work here.  As my own intellectual insecurity deepens, I&#39;m more and more interested by the confluence of the literary and political notions of representation: does Jack London &quot;represent&quot; a political or an artistic movement; how do his representations play into our conception of the politics and art of the time, and do we consider them somehow representational?  Alright, that sounds awfully pretentious, but I promise there&#39;s more to it than that.  Grist for a future post, I suppose.</p>

<p>Constructivist, I&#39;m not sure which of the lit-bloggers you ought to link to, because, well, I don&#39;t link to them.  I read Maud Newton, Scott Esposito and Edward Champion via RSS, but they&#39;re mainly for background, like <em>The New York Review of Books</em>.  As for the number of hits the Hawthorne site gets, I should probably click over when I read it, but I only do that when I comment.  It may look like far fewer people are reading it than you think.  I can&#39;t contribute much to a Hawthorne/Morrison conversation, but I&#39;ve learned a hell of lot by lurking ... which is good, since now I&#39;m a C19th guy and need to know it.<br />

		<span id="comment-63593454-content"><p>Just to clarify, Scott, I think a lot of the <i>n+1</i> editors. (In case even <i>that&#39;s</i> too ambiguous, I don&#39;t mean I obsess over how to damage their lives; I mean I respect them a great deal. I greatly respect most of the people I publicly disagree with or append to. Tut-tutting at someone like Ann Coulter would be too much of a fulltime job.)</p>

<p>That&#39;s why when I suspect them of going wrong, my first impulse is to Blame the System. In this case, sure, they (like me, like you) got disappointed by most &quot;lit-blogs&quot;. But I think their response said more about the old medium they work in than the new medium they&#39;re supposedly responding to.</p>

<p>Turbulent Velvet came to mind as one of the earliest anti-utopian voices on my usual rounds, and those pieces didn&#39;t sound like &quot;posturing&quot; to me. Unless you mean like Jack Nicholson in <i>The Departed</i>: &quot;Ha ha. She fell funny.&quot;<br />

<p>Look at, say the discussion of &quot;whither literature&quot; (in issue #4)?  Sure, there were some individually interesting essays.  But they had all been editorially chosen as if their writers were pronouncing judgement on entire genres or forms.  The effect is one of, at best, myopia, at worst, provincialism.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-63631680-content"><p>Ray, I suppose I see it a little differently: in this case, the medium&#39;s important because print&#39;s the slower, less disposable of the two.  They argue there for, I don&#39;t know, &quot;critical lethargy,&quot; a performed slowness which affords a body time to be genuinely critical.  So while it looks like the pish-poshing of the new by the old, it&#39;s actually central to their point, no?  (Not to say there isn&#39;t a reason they value slowness, and that their unfamiliarity with certain online nooks isn&#39;t responsible for that.)</p>

<p>As for Turbulent Velvet, I&#39;m not following (in no small part because I haven&#39;t seen <em>The Departed</em>).  My encounters with him have been wholly unpleasant: rank condescension coupled with an enviable lack of self-awareness about the context and implications of his own statements.  </p>

<p>Rich, what I said to Ray applies here too inasmuch as what they&#39;re doing has quite a bit to do with the medium they&#39;re doing it in.  And while that discussion of literature in #4 drew some, shall we say, highly dubious distinctions, there&#39;s something to be said in favor of open declarations of aesthetic criteria.  Too often those conversations trade in pithy misdirections about &quot;the literary.&quot;  I prefer someone say &quot;this is what it is,&quot; as I can actually argue with that.  (As opposed to the subtle non-distinctions which pass for aesthetic theory in this day and age.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-63633272-content"><p>Open declarations of aesthetic criteria are fine, but overgeneralization?  That&#39;s fine within a particular context: the blog comment box.  It&#39;s good to have a medium in which you can write strongly for two paragraphs and fulminate about how writing is being destroyed by the writing workshop, or something.  But it&#39;s not something that I associate with critical lethargy, a performed slowness which would seem to imply careful thought.  The n+1 people are in the amusing position (to me, anyway) of disparaging lit-blogging while editing a body of work that would make a great lit-blog, and in my opinion makes a not so great literary magazine.</p>

<p>That body of work does have individual essays that are quite good, of course.  But I get the impression that the more highly edited they are, the worse they are.  WBM, for example, already is writing his essays about the current situation, so getting him to do one for n+1 doesn&#39;t change what he writes.  But their editorial vision for the magazine is strong, and I don&#39;t think that it produces good writing in people who do write specifically for them.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/the_library_of_.html"><span><strong>The Library of America Presents...</strong> (X-posted to the Valve) ...some “Xtre-heeemely Cheezy Sci-Fi Ga-haaarbage.” (Credit CR and Dr. Percival Cox for the words and music there.) The popular canonization of pulp writers—The Library of America doesn’t reflect academic sensibilities as much as one might think—will directly influence the way future generations of scholars view the latter half of the twentieth century, but how accurate will it be? I ask more as an historicist than a cultural anthropologist, and largely because Daniel Green’s recent post about the relation of literary language to the world represented through it has me thinking about turn-of-the-last-century debates on the verisimilitude of “realist” and “naturalist” works. To bandy in some gross overgeneralizations, the naturalist perspective is often shorthanded—via Tennyson—“nature, red in tooth and claw.” Jack London and Frank Norris did not represent the world as it is, but as it would have been were it not for the patina of civilization. Their work may not reflect or represent society, but it does register the fact that something shook the cultural landscape, and that this something related to the crumbling of anthropocentric conceit. Daniel invokes another metaphor, that of fiction as a window through which one peers into the past, but my three models—reflection, representation and registering—seem a more useful way to consider the relationship of literature to history. M.H. Abrams already covered reflection and representation, so I’ll focus on registering here. To pick a random example: I consider myself a literary seismologist, scouring the written record for subtle signs of a larger catastrophe. I sometimes dream of stumbling into the literary equivalent of “a gaping open wound in the earth’s skin,” but mostly I content myself with reading rock face for signs of deformities evolutionary in origin. The rocks will reveal their secrets, but only if one speaks the language. To choose another entirely random example, one cannot identify Silas Weir Mitchell’s influences without being familiar with the conventions of the historical romance; the development of the Darwinian and Lamarckian branches of evolutionary science; American politics, foreign and domestic, &amp;c. Hugh Wynne, Free Quaker: Sometime Brevet Lt. Col. of His Excellency General Washington is less a window through which you can spy the nineteenth century prancing around in its unmentionables, and more an Ozarks—deceptively flat, its plateaus are all that remain of a mountain thrust high back when Bermuda waltzed into the Atlantic. Just as it takes a trained eye to look at flatland and see a mountain island surrounded by vast coral complexes, so too does it take a trained historicist to read a novel about the Revolutionary War and witness competing theories of physical and social evolution attempting to account for McKinley-era American imperialism. To return to the top now: thinking about the present in historicist terms affords me perspective I would otherwise lack, what with the contemporary moment being so contemporary and momentous. So, presuming the eyes who scan our outcrops are trained, what will they make of the twentieth century as represented in its pulpier moments. What...</span></a></div>
