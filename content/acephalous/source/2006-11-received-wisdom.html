</p>
<blockquote><p>In the 1950s, the New Criticism, championed by F.R.

Empson, was the dominant literary ideology. This insisted that the text

<p>
Which is the correct account of Empson’s relation to the New Criticism? </p></div>

			<div class="entry-more">
				 
<p>The author of the <em>Times</em> article—not to mention people who have or desire employment in an English department—should read Mark Jancovich’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521034841/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Cultural Politics of New Criticism</em></a>.&nbsp; For once, the Amazon description of an academic book is pithy and cogent:
</p>
<blockquote><p>In this book, Mark Jancovich concentrates on the works
of three leading American writers—Robert Penn Warren, John Crowe Ransom
and Allen Tate—in order to examine the development of the New Criticism
during the late 1920s and early 1930s, and its establishment within the
academy in the late 1930s and 1940s. This critical movement managed to
transform the teaching and study of English through a series of essays
published in journals such as the <em>Southern Review</em> and the <em>Kenyon Review</em>.
Jancovich argues that the New Criticism was not an example of bourgeois
individualism, as previously held, but that it sprang from a critique
of modern capitalist society developed by pre-capitalist classes within
the American South. In the process, he clarifies the distinctions
between the aims of these three Southern poets from those of the next
“generation” of New Critics such as Cleanth Brooks, Warren and Welleck,
and Wimsatt and Beardsley. He also claims that the failure on the part
of most contemporary critics to identify the movement’s ideological
origins and aims has usually meant that these critics continue to
operate within the very professional terms of reference established
through the New Critical transformations of the academy.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Empson and Richards don’t factor largely in Jancovich’s account, which
is my point—the term “New Criticism” transforms all literary
scholarship written before 1968 into a caricature of second generation
of American New Critics.&nbsp; Much of what passes for the “political” in
literary scholarship relies on the contradistinction between the
current face of literary studies and that caricature.&nbsp; I share with
those who <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/bruce_robbins_on_michael_berube/#comments">commented</a> on Bruce Robbin’s review of the <a href="http://www.michaelberube.com/">Bérubé</a> the belief that literary studies tilts left for <em>some</em> reason—but “not being a New Critic” isn’t it.

Æsthetic production is guided—in a strongly teleological sense—from the particular, through the imagination, to the universal. I’ve mused myself into a corner. Whose thought would you paraphrase like that? I’ve identified nine or ten plausible candidates, but they’re all more or less equally likely. I read this one and conclude it must be that other one. I read that other one and decide it’s probably that one over there. I read that one over there and wonder whether it wasn’t the first. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. So treat me like the idiot who presses his nose to the pointillist masterpiece and complains when all he sees is this: Be a dear and lend a fellow some perspective. UPDATE: Not a trick question! I need others to blink for me before my sanity slams its glass jaw into some meathead's hard fist ...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/ascendant_chess.html"><span><strong>Ascendant Chess Abuse: The Thomas Pynchon and Tom Waits Edition</strong> I had planned a long post on that feeling you get when the guilt over all those novels never read, films never seen and albums never listened to stops mattering in light of the sudden arrival of multiple works demanding your immediate attention. You know, like when the new Thomas Pynchon novel and Tom Waits album* ship the same day. I'll save that post for the next time Jupiter is within 4° of the ascendant of the seventh house. In its stead, I present two chess conjuncts on the cusp of relevance. The first comes from Tom Waits' &quot;The Road to Peace&quot; [.mp3]: But Bush is reluctant to risk his future, In the fear of his political failures, So he plays chess at his desk and poses for the press, Ten thousand miles from the road to peace. The second, from Michiko Kakutani's review of Against the Day: The problem is these characters are drawn in such a desultory manner that they might as well be plastic chess pieces. Which annoys you more: Waits' notion that Bush plays chess or Kakutani's that Pynchon draws plastic chess pieces? * If you're interested in hearing the new Tom Waits album, drop me a line. So long as you're honest and will buy it one day, I'm happy to share.</span></a></div>
