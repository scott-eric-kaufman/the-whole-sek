(The moments when I narrate the plot are likely the most compelling for those not interested in Film Theory 101 because I wrote them plenty funny.) Unlike my earlier posts I skipped a lot of frames. Why? Because director Bryan Singer is a loon whose camera only stops panning once in this entire sequence and there are only so many hours in the day/seconds in your attention span. We begin with a computer simulation of what's supposed to happen: Singer provides a template his audience can refer to. (Note that in the simulation the camera is above the plane. This will be important.) He pulls the camera back into a close-up on the nice stewardess lady who's explaining in her nice-stewardess-lady voice what's happening in the simulation: This would be a good time to mention that Singer films this scene like the obsessive former film student he is. The camera never stops moving. Never. The only reason this close-up doesn't become a medium close-up is because he cuts to Lois Lane asking a question. At this point the camera glides slowly and fluidly—not unlike the plane on the simulation—creating a sense of constant motion without any excitement. Then he cuts to Lois with a workmanlike reverse shot: But it's an odd reverse shot. Lois meets the stewardess's eye but there's no eyeline match because the stewardess responds to everyone on the plane: Because viewers expect eyeline matches in shot/reverse shot sequences, the stewardess's response feels like a snub. Singer violates convention in order to evoke an emotional response from the audience and does so with great efficiency: he doesn't need for Lois to look snubbed or say she feels snubbed because the editing took care of that for him. He then reverse cuts back to Lois: Who never appears to break eye contact with the stewardess. Keeping the one-sided match makes Lois seem determined. With his next cut he reveals something we had no reason to suspect: that this shot sequence has a source in the scene itself. This has a mildly unsettling effect. Singer tells the audience that he's willing to withhold critical information. What we see may be focalizing through the needs of a particular character (the network cameraman) or those of the director (Singer himself) or both.

<meta name="twitter:title" content="A scene analysis of the 9/11 analogue in Bryan Singer's &lt;em&gt;Superman Returns&lt;/em&gt;">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="Being the fourth in a series. Earlier installments can be found here: Batman Begins (first glimpse of Batman-as-classic-horror-monster at the docks: depth of field, continuity editing, eyeline match) The Dark Knight (interrogation scene: focus, lighting, framing, shot selection) The Dark Knight (fundraiser scene: camera movement, blocking, mise-en-scene) If it seems like there's a lot of narrative sans analysis in there, that's because there is. One assignment for Tuesday is that the students need to select one of the frames I didn't analyze and describe its formal properties (framing, lighting, &amp;c.). (The moments when I narrate the plot are likely the most compelling for those not interested in Film Theory 101 because I wrote them plenty funny.) Unlike my earlier posts I skipped a lot of frames. Why? Because director Bryan Singer is a loon whose camera only stops panning once in this entire sequence and there are only so many hours in the day/seconds in your attention span. We begin with a computer simulation of what's supposed to happen: Singer provides a template his audience can refer to. (Note that in the simulation the camera is above the plane. This will be important.) He pulls the camera back into a close-up on the nice stewardess lady who's explaining in her nice-stewardess-lady voice what's happening in the simulation: This would be a good time to mention that Singer films this scene like the obsessive former film student he is. The camera never stops moving. Never. The only reason this close-up doesn't become a medium close-up is because he cuts to Lois Lane asking a question. At this point the camera glides slowly and fluidly—not unlike the plane on the simulation—creating a sense of constant motion without any excitement. Then he cuts to Lois with a workmanlike reverse shot: But it's an odd reverse shot. Lois meets the stewardess's eye but there's no eyeline match because the stewardess responds to everyone on the plane: Because viewers expect eyeline matches in shot/reverse shot sequences, the stewardess's response feels like a snub. Singer violates convention in order to evoke an emotional response from the audience and does so with great efficiency: he doesn't need for Lois to look snubbed or say she feels snubbed because the editing took care of that for him. He then reverse cuts back to Lois: Who never appears to break eye contact with the stewardess. Keeping the one-sided match makes Lois seem determined.

<meta property="og:description" content="Being the fourth in a series. Earlier installments can be found here: Batman Begins (first glimpse of Batman-as-classic-horror-monster at the docks: depth of field, continuity editing, eyeline match) The Dark Knight (interrogation scene: focus, lighting, framing, shot selection) The Dark Knight (fundraiser scene: camera movement, blocking, mise-en-scene) If it seems like there's a lot of narrative sans analysis in there, that's because there is. One assignment for Tuesday is that the students need to select one of the frames I didn't analyze and describe its formal properties (framing, lighting, &amp;c.). (The moments when I narrate the plot are likely the most compelling for those not interested in Film Theory 101 because I wrote them plenty funny.) Unlike my earlier posts I skipped a lot of frames. Why? Because director Bryan Singer is a loon whose camera only stops panning once in this entire sequence and there are only so many hours in the day/seconds in your attention span. We begin with a computer simulation of what's supposed to happen: Singer provides a template his audience can refer to. (Note that in the simulation the camera is above the plane. This will be important.) He pulls the camera back into a close-up on the nice stewardess lady who's explaining in her nice-stewardess-lady voice what's happening in the simulation: This would be a good time to mention that Singer films this scene like the obsessive former film student he is. The camera never stops moving. Never. The only reason this close-up doesn't become a medium close-up is because he cuts to Lois Lane asking a question. At this point the camera glides slowly and fluidly—not unlike the plane on the simulation—creating a sense of constant motion without any excitement. Then he cuts to Lois with a workmanlike reverse shot: But it's an odd reverse shot. Lois meets the stewardess's eye but there's no eyeline match because the stewardess responds to everyone on the plane: Because viewers expect eyeline matches in shot/reverse shot sequences, the stewardess's response feels like a snub. Singer violates convention in order to evoke an emotional response from the audience and does so with great efficiency: he doesn't need for Lois to look snubbed or say she feels snubbed because the editing took care of that for him. He then reverse cuts back to Lois: Who never appears to break eye contact with the stewardess. Keeping the one-sided match makes Lois seem determined. With his next cut he reveals something we had no reason to suspect: that this shot sequence has a source in the scene itself. This has a mildly unsettling effect. Singer tells the audience that he's willing to withhold critical information. What we see may be focalizing through the needs of a particular character (the network cameraman) or those of the director (Singer himself) or both.

<p>This would be a good time to mention that Singer films this scene like the obsessive former film student he is.&#0160; The camera never stops moving.&#0160; Never.&#0160; The only reason this close-up doesn&#39;t become a <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48047">medium close-up</a> is because he cuts to Lois Lane asking a question.&#0160; At this point the camera glides slowly and fluidly—not unlike the plane on the simulation—creating a sense of constant motion without any excitement.&#0160; Then he cuts to Lois with a workmanlike <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#51531">reverse shot</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f160062970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3418980" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f160062970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f160062970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p>But it&#39;s an odd reverse shot.&#0160; Lois meets the stewardess&#39;s eye but there&#39;s no <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#98485">eyeline match</a> because the stewardess responds to everyone on the plane:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f160187970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3418984" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f160187970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f160187970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p>Because viewers expect eyeline matches in shot/reverse shot sequences, the stewardess&#39;s response feels like a snub.&#0160; Singer violates convention in order to evoke an emotional response from the audience and does so with great efficiency: he doesn&#39;t need for Lois to look snubbed or say she feels snubbed because the editing took care of that for him.&#0160; He then reverse cuts back to Lois:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d358f970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3419017" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d358f970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d358f970b-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p>Who never appears to break eye contact with the stewardess.&#0160; Keeping the one-sided match makes Lois seem determined.&#0160; With his next cut he reveals something we had no reason to suspect: that this shot sequence has a source in the scene itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f160526970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3419050" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f160526970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f160526970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p>This has a mildly unsettling effect.&#0160; Singer tells the audience that he&#39;s willing to withhold critical information.&#0160; What we see may be focalizing through the needs of a particular character (the network cameraman) or those of the director (Singer himself) or both.&#0160; I say &quot;both&quot; because Singer immediately cuts to <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48019">a point of view shot</a> from the cameraman&#39;s perspective as he <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#23580">whip pans</a> from Lois to the stewardess:</p>

<p>The camera stops and settles on a <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48043">medium long shot</a> of the stewardess as she continues explaining what will happen when the space shuttle piggybacked to the plane separates.&#0160; Singer then cuts away from the cameraman&#39;s perspective and shows a close up of the plane and shuttle coupling devices in the simulation:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f1609de970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3419134" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f1609de970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f1609de970c-320wi" /></a></em>&#0160;</p>
<p>Unless that&#39;s a close up <em>of a close up</em>.&#0160; If this is from the cameraman&#39;s perspective the only way to get this picture would be for him to have zoomed in on the monitor showing the simulation.&#0160; That would make what follows a close up of a <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48039">long shot</a>:&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f160b66970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3419203" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f160b66970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f160b66970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure this status of these shots matters all that much, but I am invested in you paying close attention.&#0160; Moving on.&#0160; Singer reverse cuts from the monitor to a medium close-up of Lois:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f160d0e970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3419243" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f160d0e970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f160d0e970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p>Then from that shot to this one:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d3f24970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3419257" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d3f24970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d3f24970b-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p>How do we know that&#39;s not the simulation?&#0160; Because the camera tilts <em>up </em>to the plane and shuttle instead of <em>down </em>on them.&#0160; Plus the shuttle in the simulation already decoupled.&#0160; But Singer wants to avoid all possible confusion because he&#39;s about to start in on a rather impressive bit of prolonged <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#51525">parallel editing</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d4016970b-pi" style="display: inline;"></a><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f1612d6970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3419293" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f1612d6970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f1612d6970c-320wi" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/fact-the-ongoing-quality-of-popular-culture-ruins-perfectly-fine-lectures.html">KUTNER</a>!&#0160; Not really.&#0160; But that is Kal Penn cutting something delicately for Lex Luthor.&#0160; Hard to tell what it is.&#0160; Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we could somehow—</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d40c5970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3419360" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d40c5970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d40c5970b-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Much obliged.&#0160; So we have Lois in a plane with a space shuttle parked on it and Kal Penn cutting a millimeter off the tip of a crystal somewhere.&#0160; The trick to parallel editing is rhythm: you need to give each of the multiple narrative lines enough screen time relative to the others to remind the audience that they&#39;re happening simultaneously.&#0160; Spend too long on any one of them and the others will seem to have stalled.&#0160; Singer knows this and cuts back to the plane and shuttle:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f16137e970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3419414" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f16137e970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f16137e970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Or not:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f161414970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3419443" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f161414970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f161414970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But fooling us into thinking we were back with the plane has the same effect as cutting back to the plane: it reminds the audience that of the other narrative and prevents it from stalling.&#0160; But why is there a model plane?&#0160; Because (in a sequence I&#39;m not going to show you for reasons of space) the crystal Kal Penn cut is going to be dropped into a lake in the middle of a model town:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d461c970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3419499" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d461c970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d461c970b-320wi" /></a> </span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Note how Singer&#39;s still futzing with conventional perspective.&#0160; This is a medium long shot that looks like an <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48035">extreme long</a> or <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm#51530">establishing shot</a>.&#0160; Or at least that what it looks like until it doesn&#39;t look like anything at all:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d485b970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3419874" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d485b970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d485b970b-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The grain-of-sand-sized bit of crystal Kumar dropped in the fake lake caused a power outage.&#0160; Given how tiny that crystal bit was I&#39;m sure the outage is localized—</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f16196b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3420079" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f16196b970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f16196b970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nope.&#0160; The lights also went out in some random bar somewhere.&#0160; Probably close to the—</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f161a4e970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3420105" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f161a4e970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f161a4e970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So all the lights and cars in the city also went dead.&#0160; Happens all the time when someone launches an EMP.&#0160; Nothing to worry about.&#0160; The cars will start working again momentarily.&#0160; It&#39;s not like they&#39;re going to drop out of the sky or something with power.&#0160; Wait a minute isn&#39;t Lois Lane in a—</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f161b68970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3420229" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f161b68970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f161b68970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nothing to worry about.&#0160; The NASA place never blacked out.&#0160; Lois is safe as houses up there.&#0160; Nifty bit of parallel editing.&#0160; After cutting to random places blacking out he moved into another scene where another narrative will be playing out.&#0160; He cuts to a close up of one of the NASA technicians doing his job:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f161d46970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3420359" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f161d46970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f161d46970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Everything is normal.&#0160; No need to panic—</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f161df3970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3420370" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f161df3970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f161df3970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Shit.&#0160; Singer lulled us into thinking the blackout hit everywhere simultaneously by showing the random bar and the city.&#0160; Then he went back in narrative time and only now do we see the effects of the blackout.&#0160; But at least the plane still has power:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f1621e3970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3420472" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f1621e3970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f1621e3970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&quot;We here in the space shuttle lost Houston.&#0160; Can you reach them airplane pilots?&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&quot;Us airplane pilots lost Houston too.&#0160; Good thing we won&#39;t be needing them.&#0160; We should start decoupling.&#0160; But first I need to make sure the engine&#39;s still turning.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d53aa970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3420586" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d53aa970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700d53aa970b-320wi" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&quot;The engine&#39;s fine.&#0160; Time to decouple!&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&quot;This is Houston.&#0160; We had a power outage but now we&#39;re back.&#0160; You two crazy kids decouple yet?&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Meanwhile, in the random bar from earlier that turns out not to be random:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The power comes back on and Jimmy Olsen is watching a random baseball game by himself.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I meant &quot;Jimmy Olsen is watching a baseball game with Clark Kent.&quot;&#0160; I was gonna say that but it seemed unimportant.&#0160; I wonder what&#39;s going on with Kumar and the fake city?</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Disaster</em>?&#0160; That can&#39;t be good.&#0160; Perspective-wise Singer films this disaster as if it&#39;s happening to a real city.&#0160; When trains fly off the rails you don&#39;t see Lex Luthor in the background.&#0160; He spends a good minute depicting the devestation of the fake metropolis.&#0160; Then he cuts back to the NASA place:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Because this post is made of pictures, you can&#39;t hear the waxing of the dunt dunna, dunna nunna, dun dun dunt, dunna nunna but I promise it&#39;s there.&#0160; Also of note is Singer&#39;s slavish fidelity to the original.&#0160; Not only does he recycle the John Williams score to <em>Superman </em>(1978), his first appearance of Superman shot directly references the original.&#0160; To wit:</p>

</object>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Why would he reference the earlier film so explicitly?&#0160; What rhetorical purpose does that serve, that is, who is the intended audience for that tracking shot?&#0160; Moving along: Singer then cuts to an out of focus shot of something fuzzy:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f163209970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3429682" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f163209970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f163209970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nothing in this shot is in focus, but contrary to what I said in class today, this is not because everything in the frame is not because the <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#38662">depth of field</a> is so absurdly shallow it captures nothing.&#0160; The depth of field describes how the aperture of the lens relative to the location of the objects and the level of lighting and look a pretty butterfly!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f2cfc970b-pi"><img alt="Depthoffield" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f2cfc970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f2cfc970b-320pi" title="Depthoffield" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When the butterfly is too close to the lens, it appears unfocused.&#0160; Same thing when it&#39;s too far away.&#0160; If you imagine the butterfly is fluttering towards you, you have what I thought was happening in this shot: Kent is too far away at first and runs into the depth of field.&#0160; But I was wrong.&#0160; Singer slowly <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#53908">racks the focus</a> here such that <em>everything </em>comes into focus:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f180137970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3429699" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f180137970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f180137970c-320wi" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Had Kent been entering the depth of field the cars behind him would have stayed blurry.&#0160; Note that this is not how racking focus normally works, but sometimes violating conventions can be rhetorically effective (as it was with the lack of eyeline match earlier).&#0160; All that said, right before cutting away Singer does monkey with the depth of field:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f18027c970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3429705" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f18027c970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f18027c970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At this point Singer has stopped fiddling with the focus and Kent is simply too close to the camera.&#0160; Note that by letting him run out of the depth of field right when he rips his shirt has the effect of turning Kent the jogger into Superman the blur.&#0160; Meanwhile, miles above the Earth the secondary boosters are about to fire and Lois is struggling to get back to her seat:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f332c970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3429880" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f332c970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f332c970b-320wi" /></a> </span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Note the angle of the camera: it is tilted to the left in order to make Lois appear to be climbing uphill—which she is because of the angle the plane is pitched at.&#0160; Were you in the plane, however, she would not appear to be tilted <em>because your head would be too</em>.&#0160; This is another example of Singer violating the natural perspective for rhetorical effect.&#0160; (Natural perspective being our shorthand for how cameras as eye-surrogates typically view the world.)&#0160; Singer then cuts back to NASA:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f181397970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3429900" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f181397970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f181397970c-320wi" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&quot;Shuttle, this is Houston.&#0160; Were you able to stop the secondary boosters from igniting?&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f3b90970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3429972" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f3b90970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f3b90970b-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&quot;Nega—&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f18154e970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3429981" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f18154e970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f18154e970c-320wi" /></a> </span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At which point Singer whip-pans the struggling Lois to the back wall of the plane:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f18197e970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3430011" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f18197e970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f18197e970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Skipping ahead a bit—Singer&#39;s editing is so busy I can&#39;t possibly cover it all—we have Lois fighting the g-forces to grab the oxygen mask:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f3fc6970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3430287" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f3fc6970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f3fc6970b-320wi" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Singer opts for a close-up of her face to emphasize the struggle, then cuts to her hand, then to an <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm#48049">extreme close-up</a> of her face:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f40d1970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3430310" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f40d1970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f40d1970b-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">First item of note: Singer violates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180_degree_rule">the 180° rule</a> three times in the span of ten seconds.&#0160; Why would he purposely disorient the reader in this respect?&#0160; Second item of note: after failing to grab the oxygen mask, but while still trying to lay her paws on it, <em>Lois</em> <em>looks out the window for absolutely no reason</em>.&#0160; Singer pans to follow her glance and what does she see?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f1823d1970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3430328" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f1823d1970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f1823d1970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course.&#0160; Only there&#39;s no compelling reason within the scene for her to look out the window right there.&#0160; Singer gives common sense and narrative logic the finger in order to score emotional points.&#0160; Is he successful?&#0160; It depends.&#0160; Are you the sort of person who hates puppies and kittens and flowers and loves the anal retentiveness of this post?&#0160; If you are, your answer to that question might be different from that of the average moviegoer.&#0160; But how about we just finish this scene now?&#0160; Sound good?&#0160; Good.&#0160; Superman lands on the roof of the plane and shows those astronauts the meaning of the phrase &quot;manual decoupling&quot;:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f1830ca970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3430516" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f1830ca970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f1830ca970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While the plane spins wildly back to earth:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f183246970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3430833" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f183246970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f183246970c-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Superman admires his handiwork:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f4ce9970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3431052" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f4ce9970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f4ce9970b-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(<em>humming own theme song</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f18348e970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3431129" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f18348e970c " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f18348e970c-320wi" /></a> </span>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&quot;Wasn&#39;t there something else I was supposed to be doing?&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef01156f183564970c-pi" style="display: inline;"></a><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f4fe6970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vlcsnap-3431148" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f4fe6970b " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f4fe6970b-320wi" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&quot;SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT!&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At this point Singer executes the niftiest mid-air whip pan in the history of cinema.&#0160; Think about where the camera would have to be; namely, 30,000 ft. and plunging but at a slightly slower speed than the plane.&#0160; I&#39;ve slowed it down so you can see the effect:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f651f970b-pi"><img alt="Mid-air-whip-pan-template" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f651f970b image-full " src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0115700f651f970b-pi" title="Mid-air-whip-pan-template" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If anyone asks why this scene feels exciting, think about what Singer did with natural perspective there.&#0160; I could keep going with this until the plane crashes into The House That Ruth Built and 40,000 Yankee fans are incinerated in a flash, but since that doesn&#39;t happen I figure I&#39;ll just end the post. &#0160;&#0160;</p>

But in truth, the much more interesting sexual dynamic in the film involves Singer and Routh-as-Superman --- there&#39;s a gay male aesthetic present throughout the film, I&#39;m told.  (I&#39;m being serious both about it being there and having been told about it.  I&#39;m not as familiar with the conventions of queer cinema as I should be, but apparently Singer&#39;s depiction plays off some of its stereotypes.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef011570111bd7970b-content"><p>Regarding the first post, the 9-11 motif didn&#39;t work for me for a couple reasons, but mainly because for us, the audience, superman never left.  We begin the movie with him &quot;returning&quot;, so there&#39;s no real catharsis there.  We still don&#39;t have him in real life and, given the multitude of movie superheroes lately, it&#39;s not like his was a yawning cinematic absence.  Then there&#39;s the fact that Singer&#39;s film ultimately paints Superman, not as a fabulous savior, much less as a necessary evil, but as a creepy stalker who saves people so that he can continue to stare at them through the walls of their house.  OK, not just that, but yeesh.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m the sort of person who loves puppies and kittens and flowers, doesn&#39;t tend to watch movies for individual shots and doesn&#39;t care so much about violating convention, but artificiality is a problem if you notice it.  The problem for me came much earlier in the Lois-Lane-gets-out-of-her-seat-during-an-emergency-situation sequence.  As Kenneth Turan <br />
<a href="http://www.dailypress.com/entertainment/movies/stv-movies-reviews-supermanreturns,0,2485258.story" rel="nofollow">observed</a>, Kate Bosworth is a game actress, but doesn&#39;t have the chops to give her character depth, make the broken heart at abandonment by superman thing convincing.  This makes the putting herself and others in danger shtick seem moronic rather than plucky (this is even more poignant/infuriating in the &quot;let&#39;s bring my young son to the super villain’s hideout&quot; scene).  Margot Kidder managed to infuse her Lane with the awareness both that she was compensating for sexist coddling and that she was a real adrenaline junky who enjoyed putting herself in danger.  Bosworth&#39;s lane just seemed somewhat self-involved.  The combination of arbitrariness, lack of emotional connection, and problems of believability, meant that during the scene where she gets bounced around inside the passenger compartment, I wasn&#39;t thinking, &quot;Oh no! What will happen to her?&quot;, but &quot;She would have been knocked out twenty seconds into this, dead a minute later, and then probably taken a couple of other passengers out with her as her lifeless body pummeled them to death.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe Singer was somehow trying to deconstruct the Superman mythos, but he sure wasn&#39;t doing a good job of it.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef011570122d1b970b-content"><p><em>Regarding the first post, the 9-11 motif didn&#39;t work for me for a couple reasons, but mainly because for us, the audience, superman never left. We begin the movie with him &quot;returning&quot;, so there&#39;s no real catharsis there.</em></p>

<p>Singer needed to set that up more forcefully at first, because the audience never really feels his absence (opening the film with his return will do that), so what follows may be an artifact of me having re-watched the film a couple times, but I do think that Singer establishes the world-wide elation at Superman&#39;s sudden reappearance: the montage of devastations averted and kittens rescued betray an impolitic giddiness to the social body of the sort that flies in the face of reality.  An exuberance so earnestly and consistently performed points to a depression <em>in petto</em>, and because I&#39;m feeling literal today, let me rephrase it thus: you&#39;re only implacably giddy on a mountaintop if your lungs ain&#39;t used to the thin air; so from the fact that you&#39;re sucking wind between giggles, we can infer that you&#39;re unaccustomed to breathing at high altitudes, that you have, in fact, spent a few years in the heavy air of some deep valley.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re correct, the film would&#39;ve worked better had Singer followed in Nolan&#39;s footsteps and kept the audience in the dark as to when Batman would actually be beginning.  As I noted in the <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/batman-begins-works-because-christopher-nolan-decided-to-spend-the-first-hour-and-twenty-minutes-denying-the-audience-what-it.html" rel="nofollow"><em>Batman Begins</em></a> post, it&#39;s not like we think Batman&#39;ll never arrive, it&#39;s that we want him to and Nolan denies us that pleasure.  Singer&#39;s film would&#39;ve worked better, more viscerally, had he done something analogous.  </p>

<p>That said, there hadn&#39;t been a Superman film in 14 years, and the actor people not in the AARP associate with Superman had, in fact, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_reeve" rel="nofollow">disappeared forever two years earlier</a>.  (On some level, Singer was aware of that fact, otherwise why would he have chosen a clone for his lead?)</p>

<p><em>Then there&#39;s the fact that Singer&#39;s film ultimately paints Superman, not as a fabulous savior, much less as a necessary evil, but as a creepy stalker who saves people so that he can continue to stare at them through the walls of their house.</em></p>

<p>You see, I <em>liked</em> this part, not because he was deconstructing the Superman mythos in the colloquial sense of &quot;deconstructing,&quot; but because he was deconstructing the Superman character in the technical sense: the film addresses the deep melancholy of the character that Reeve&#39;s chippy earnestness always obscured.  <em>Superman Returns</em> embraced the first half-hour of the 1978 film in a way the Reeve films never did.  Singer&#39;s Superman was and is despondent: he leaves Earth, the place a dying father on a planet entrusted him to protect, on the off-chance that he could locate some other Kryptonians.  Why?  Because he wanted to live among peers, to have not even a family, but an equal.  It&#39;s a typical immigrant tale of the sort the bespoken devotion to Truth, Justice and the American Way tends to erase.  How can he embody the American Way when he&#39;s even less of a <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/were-i-a-real-american-i-wouldve-ended-this-post-it-doesnt-help-matters-any-that-they-all-look-alike.html" rel="nofollow">Real American than I am</a>?  (<em>Edit: Linked for posterity, not because I don&#39;t believe you can remember what I wrote yesterday</em>.)  All of this is Anglicized out of the Reeve films, but it&#39;s there, in all its creepiness, in all its pained immodesty, and that works . . . </p>

<p>. . . except when Singer feels the need to prove Umberto Eco correct by showing that, above all else, Superman defends the property rights of powerful interests.  There he is, floating in space, ostensibly able to hear the life drain from a murdered Sudanese or the hunger pangs of a Muscovian orphan, but instead of putting himself in front of a Janjaweed bullet or plowing and irrigating the Russian steppes, he stops a bank robbery.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef011570143b5a970b-content"><p>One thing that annoyed me about this movie, and actually the other Superman movies as well, is that for some reason they always portray Luthor as some third rater conman, rather than the corporate titan he usually is in the comics. In this movie, he actually plays rent boy to some elderly rich woman to get the start-up capital for his scheme. </p>

<p>Why is that? It robs the character of the very plausibility he has as a villain: Superman might be a superhuman individual, but his strengths are all physical (unless you go with some of the really stupid 50s era comics that give him super-basketweaving). Luthor&#39;s an ordinary human, but he&#39;s so smart and rich that he can use the system to even the odds up a bit. </p>

<p>One of the best Superman comics I ever saw involved Superman running in Luthor for some complicated crime, and then Luthor walking out of the courthouse a free man thanks to his wealth and his hordes of lawyers and just smirking at Superman as he walked off scott-free. <br />
So much better than giant icicle-islands. </p></span>

More on that tomorrow.) It goes without saying that Bryan Singer's Superman Returns (2006) is not a very good film. Or so I thought before hitting up Rotten Tomatoes. Let me put it this way: I think Superman Returns is a mediocre but interesting film. If you look at my chart you can probably guess why: the film mines the imagery of 9/11 in order to address the shit mist of uncertainty Americans fumbled through from 9/12 forward. The Americans in the film had themselves a Superman and the supreme confidence having a Superman entails. Then they lost him. Suddenly and inexplicably. Singer wants his audience to imagine what it would be like to wake up one morning and realize that the truly terrible things that never happen here can now happen here. Not too hard. I remember staring numbly at video of the first Tower smoking when I saw the nose of the second plane enter the frame: I was watching the truly terrible things that never happen here happening here and I felt sick. The sense of security I lost that morning never returned. No amount of anything will ever bring it back . . . with the possible exception of the arrival of Superman. The Americans in the film have learned to live without Superman. Or so they tell themselves. Lois Lane wins a Pulitzer for a stiff upper lip of an article entitled &quot;Why the World Doesn't Need Superman&quot; but the article has all the conviction of an empty gesture. (&quot;I never really loved you either!&quot; says the man whose girlfriend just left him.) When Clark Kent suddenly reappears after five years of being elsewhere, the audience knows what the Americans in the film don't: they can quiet that nagging nothing in the pit of their guts and breathe a little easier because Superman is back. Untangling why actual Americans are happy for their fake brethren is something of a chore, so let me leave it at this: 9/11 so rattled our presumptions that we experience real pleasure at the very thought that someone out there might reclaim some of the gusto they lost that morning even if that someone is an imitation American on a Sydney sound stage. Whatever the circumstances, the film's most powerful moment was always going to be when Superman reappeared. But Singer goes one step further and stages this scene in a manner designed to prime our 9/11 pumps without calling attention to what makes us shit the sheets (terrorism generally and Islamic fundamentalism in particular). All the props are there—the airplanes, the New York City landmarks, the air traffic controllers—but Singer stripped them of their normal significance so they only horrify secondhandedly. The scene I'll analyze tomorrow is equivalent to what the man who lost control over his car and slammed into a ditch in December feels when he starts...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/04/were-i-a-real-american-i-wouldve-ended-this-post-it-doesnt-help-matters-any-that-they-all-look-alike.html"><span><strong>Were I a “Real American,” I would’ve ended this post “It doesn’t help matters any that they all look alike.”</strong> Via PostBourgie, I learn that Texas State Representative Betty Brown thinks Asian-Americans should adopt names “easier for Americans to deal with.” When called out on this, a spokesperson compounded Rep. Brown’s idiocy by saying “her comments were only an attempt to overcome problems with identifying Asian names for voting purposes.” Problem the first: if people vote in American elections, they’re Americans, so the notion that they ought to adopt names “easier for Americans to deal with” entails a definition of “American” that excludes “American citizens.” These citizens are Americans who “deal with” their names dandily, so Rep. Brown’s statement makes no sense on its face—unless you assume that she means to exclude certain American citizens from her definition of “American.” Had she been a little clearer, this confusion could’ve been avoided. All she needed to say is that Asian-Americans should adopt names “easier for Real Americans to deal with” and no one would’ve batted an eye at the remarks by the racist old white woman from Texas. Problem the second: I teach at a school where more than half of the students are of East or Southeast Asian descent, and let me tell you: I have never had a class that wasn’t stuffed full of Jennifers and Jessicas. Why? I’m not as qualified to speak to this as I would’ve been had LSU not dismantled the linguistics program my senior year (not that I’m bitter), but as I remember it, about half of the Chinese consonants fall somewhere between what native English speakers would hear as a “j,” so to native Chinese speakers “Jessica” and “Jennifer” sound more like actual names. I could expand this out to the voiceless affricative equivalent of “j,” the English “ch” sound, but suffice to say that if you think about all the different ways you can pronounce “Beijing,” you’ll see my point. So it only makes sense that the most common Chinese-American names have initial consonant sounds that resemble Chinese phonemes. (I could expand it even further and talk about more than Chinese, but the same principle applies.) All of which is only to say that if the Asian-American community wants to make it easier for “Real Americans to deal with” them, they don’t need to simplify their names so much as make them more complex. One quarter I had three students in a class or twenty-three named “Jennifer Hu” and two named “Jessica Quan.” Not that I count as a “Real American,” mind you, but if I did I wouldn’t be advocating for less variety in Asian-American names but much more.
