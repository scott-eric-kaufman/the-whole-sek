<p>It’s a good thing Mitt Romney’s not a drunken frat boy.</p>
<p>You know why Mitt Romney’s awesome? Check out his stats: he has so

<p>Obama? All daughters. Mister Rogers was a pussy.</p>
<p>Science says Romney should have all the lady-votes. Even Obama’s 
bitch should vote for him. I’m not saying he’s a polygamist, but he 
could be if he wanted to. Like this rich guy who had 61 children and 
they were all boys. He can’t have a harem, but if he could bitches would
 be lining up to join it. He’s in charge. Because now that we don’t hunt
 it’s all about the money and Mitt has more. He’s more President than 
the last eight Presidents. If he paid taxes, he’d pay more a year than 
Obama’s worth. If he didn’t tap ass so expertly he’d have more money 
than the only wealthy black guy I can think of who’s a rapper.</p>
<p>It’s time for Romney to drop trou’ and show us his moneybags.</p>
<p>Some hippies think calling him “R-MONEY” is funny. The only wealthy 
black guy I can think of uses lowercase letters but R-MONEY’s 
capitalized. He drops can do what black rappers do only bigger. Rappers 
have money, but R-MONEY’s money has money and it lives in money. He has 
so much money it’s heavy.</p>
<p>Romney’s always saying that he loves money, and that we should love 
money, but the haters will hate. He celebrates people with money and how
 they got it. He even loves the little money so much he once didn’t give
 in a fight to protect it. He could’ve sued that guy and took his money 
but the point is he was on an airplane he didn’t own because he cares 
about the little money. He could buy his own airplanes and still have 
more money than an actress and a Senator. And the Senator can’t even 
remember how many houses he owns.</p>
<p>I suppose he’s frontin’ and good on him. Humility is next to 
godliness which is next to money. But he needs to stop frontin’ and 
start ballin’ like the player he is. He should show us his money. He 
should show us how awesome it is having his money. People will be like 
“I don’t hate you or your money! I love your money!” They sit on there 
couches without nearly the amount of his money and watch someone who 
only acts like he has money curb-stomping poor people. They don’t hate 
that guy with the 17 Italian cars because he has 39 other ones and 
they’re green. Lots of children of men like Mitt Romney don’t turn into 
R-MONEY. That Senator has more houses than he can remember but is his 
daughter going to turn into R-MONEY?</p>
<p>Romney should find out what happened to some other rich guy but not 
tell anyone about it because he voted for Obama. But he spent his money 
so hard nobody can even find him anymore. When someone asked that rich 
guy about his money he said he’d had it since the Puritans. Romney 
should follow his lead and talk about the rich history of his money all 
the time.</p>
<p>He’s always had money—his Dad was CEO and America—but he gave it 
Dad’s money away and started a school so people remembered Dad’s money. 
Why? Because he already had his money by the time Dad kicked. His Dad 
was a boss. So is Romney. Men want to be under him. He will curb-stomp 
poor people. His sons will curb-stomp poor people. Obama was never a 
boss until the democratic process made him one and only because when 
Americans travel to Europe they act like assholes. Obama made his little
 money in politics and by writing about himself. He’d be nothing without
 a foul-mouthed Jew.</p>
<p>Elections aren’t about issues. They’re not about our money. They’re 
about his money and what it took to get it: leadership. Romney rules and
 we don’t. Some former someone once had some uppity bitch try to teach 
him to be like Romney and she failed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Show us your big dick” she said. “A man is top dog” she 
said. Then she said “Everyone thinks you’re a pussy so prove you can 
man-up.” But she also said the opposite about another guy when she 
didn’t like him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But she was right the first time—only a man with a dick that makes 
sons and grandsons who rape people is a man. Some lady told us that we 
need a lot of people and Romney made a lot of people and they’re men. A 
magazine called Romney a pussy, but look at the size of his money. Look 
at what his dick made. Look at his wife back when she was attractive and
 look at him smirking about the ass she lost to time. Why should he 
worry about people knowing about his money? I bet he doesn’t. He’s done 
everything right and should own it. And by own it I mean flash mad 
plastic and put it on a jet or something.</p>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/08/obamas-dan-quayle-moment.html"><span><strong>Obama's &quot;Dan Quayle moment&quot;</strong> Surprise! It never happened. But I'm not opposed to conservatives claiming it did, if only because it makes my life even easier than it already was. Here's the allegedly damning image: Conservatives look at this and salivate: &quot;The President misspelled 'Ohio'! That's worse than misspelling 'potato' because 'potato' ain't a state!&quot; At the second link above—which I can't recommend clicking on, because that's what you have me for—the comments are largely anticipatory about how the mainstream media will spin this. One person heads off the excuse that the image has been reversed because in an image taken moments later, Obama's watch is still on his left arm. Another cracks wise about how Arabic is written from right-to-left and what we all know about Obama's real religious affiliation. But not a single one of them points out the blindingly obvious fact that the people in the picture are facing the camera. Which means that their left is the photographer's right. So from their perspective they're spelling &quot;O-H-I-O,&quot; which as many of you know is the proper spelling of &quot;Ohio.&quot; Not that there isn't a legitimate complaint to be made: I'm not sure I'm entirely comfortable with a Leader of the Free World not knowing how to spell out words via a human chain. What if that 3 a.m. phone call is from the Village People in 1978? An entire generation might be left wandering dark streets and darker alleys in a vain search for the ACMY.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/08/whos-defrauding-the-university-of-california-now.html"><span><strong>Who's defrauding the University of California, now?</strong> SEK's insurance provider outsourced its &quot;dependent eligibility verification process&quot; to a company called Secova whose homepage redirects to a shifty search engine that's already looking for &quot;xanax bars.&quot; Or it redirects to an ebay store selling Unique Jewelry from Paula. [DO NOT CLICK ON THOSE LINKS UNLESS YOU LIKE TROJANS AND YOU DON'T LIKE TROJANS.] The point being that it redirects ... and that his insurance company required him to send this company his last two years of tax returns to prove that he's married to his wife. Had SEK known about the fraudulent web-redirects before speaking to this representative this conversation would've gone much differently. Not that he finds any of this surprising mind you. Now that they're not returning his calls, SEK will provide them with some free publicity. SEK: What's with you not wanting to acknowledge that I'm married to my wife? SECOVA REPRESENTATIVE: Did you know your wife has a different last name than you? SEK: Yes. She kept her maiden name. SECOVA REPRESENTATIVE: That's odd. Hold on (audibly typing) &quot;kept ... maiden ... name.&quot; What's wrong with yours ha ha ha? SEK: (resisting the urge to say &quot;Mine's too Jewish&quot;) Nothing. SECOVA REPRESENTATIVE: I see. And who told her to keep it ha ha ha? SEK: ? SECOVA REPRESENTATIVE: It just seems strange. Woman marries a man, keeps her own name. Like it's not a real marriage ha ha ha. SEK: (resisting the urge to say &quot;After 13 years, someone's finally busted us, congratulations, sir!&quot;) ?? SECOVA REPRESENTATIVE: We're going to have to investigate this. I'm not saying it looks suspicious, but if we can't verify you're married, she'll lose her coverage on September 11th. SEK: (resisting the urge to say, well, something about 9/11 and Obama and the ACA) ??? SECOVA REPRESENTATIVE: We'll be in touch once we've sorted your relationship out. You could've made this easy if you just made her change her name, you know ha ha ha. Ha ha ha.</span></a></div>
