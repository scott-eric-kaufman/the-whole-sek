        <meta name="description" content="Irrational insomniacs have for centuries fought sleeplessness with objects designed to keep them awake. Who am I to break with tradition? So I have spent the past two nights engrossed in the works of Robert Charles Wilson . (Someone I trusted told me someone he trusted had recommended Wilson. Three degrees of separation suffices in the sci-fi community.) I read and was impressed by Spin. So I was groggily enthused when I began reading Blind Lake late last night. &quot;Here is an author,&quot; I said to myself, possibly aloud, &quot;who rigorously works through the implications of his fantastic premises.&quot; Blind Lake proved to be an original and inventive novel. Unfortunately it proved to be the same original and inventive novel I'd read earlier in the week. &quot;Why does this keep happening!&quot; I yelled as The Little Womedievalist's alarm sounded. &quot;What?&quot; &quot;Nothing, dear, nothing.

Add one large egg and beat until she almost can't feel again. You want her dejected but not suicidal, so pay attention to how much she cries. If she starts balling constantly, ease up on the whipping until you think she can handle it. Once you get her to the brink, add in the other man who wants to feel her again. (Some people like to spice this up with the rogue genius, but I prefer to wait until after the second inexplicable phenonemon caused by pervasive interstellar Buddhism.) Stir. Once the two men who want to feel the woman who wants to feel again have been properly agitated, add 1/2 a tsp. of kosher salt and another egg and beat vigorously. You want one of the men to fall apart. Once one has, remove the other and set him alongside the genius.

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, dear, nothing.&nbsp; Just blog stuff.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nevermind,&quot; I said.&nbsp; So, without further ado, I present the recipe for writing Robert Charles Wilson novels:</p><blockquote><p>1 large bowl<br />2 isolated group of humans<br />1 tsp. kosher salt<br />1 woman who &quot;wants to feel again&quot;<br />2 men who want to feel her again<br />1 rogue genius<br />2 inexplicable phenomenon caused by pervasive interstellar Buddhism<br />1 cipher to embody it<br />3 large eggs

</p>

<p>Isolate one scientifically-inclined human community in an inexplicable planetary envelope or military cordon in a large bowl.&nbsp; Add the woman who wants to feel again and beat her until she's good and numb.&nbsp; Slowly add one of the men who wants to feel her again.&nbsp; (Set the second aside for later.)&nbsp; Once you see life enter her eyes again, quickly pour the first inexplicable phenonemon caused by pervasive interstellar Buddhism into bowl.&nbsp; Add one large egg and beat until she almost can't feel again.&nbsp; You want her dejected but not suicidal, so pay attention to how much she cries.&nbsp; If she starts balling constantly, ease up on the whipping until you think she can handle it.</p>

<p>Once you get her to the brink, add in the other man who wants to feel her again.&nbsp; (Some people like to spice this up with the rogue genius, but I prefer to wait until after the second inexplicable phenonemon caused by pervasive interstellar Buddhism.)&nbsp; Stir.&nbsp; Once the two men who want to feel the woman who wants to feel again have been properly agitated, add 1/2 a tsp. of kosher salt and another egg and beat vigorously.&nbsp; You want one of the men to fall apart.&nbsp; Once one has, remove the other and set him alongside the genius.&nbsp; (You'll need them to season the second inexplicable phenonemon caused by pervasive interstellar Buddhism.)&nbsp; Add the cipher and refrigerate.&nbsp; This part of the recipe should bore you.</p>

<p>Pre-heat the oven to 3500° for fifteen minutes.&nbsp; As soon as the boredom is replaced by real narrative heat, remove the cooled plot from the refrigerator.&nbsp; Sprinkle the other man who wants her, the genius and the second inexplicable phenonemon caused by pervasive interstellar Buddhism on the mixture and place it in the oven.&nbsp; Let it cook for 150 pages.&nbsp; (About two hours.)&nbsp; When you think it's done, violently open the oven door and yank the mixture of the oven.&nbsp; Don't worry if it ends up all over the cabinets and walls.&nbsp; You weren't going to eat it anyway.&nbsp; You had it once, remember, and while satisfying the first time you knew you didn't want to have it again.&nbsp; Then why did you cook it?&nbsp; That's right:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.henryfarrell.net/">Henry Farrell</a> told you to.&nbsp; Once you've cleaned the kitchen up, sit at your desk, turn on your computer and send him anonymous hate mail. <br />&nbsp; </p></blockquote>

		<span id="comment-15080838-content"><p>Yeah, but almost every SF writer writes the same book over and over to some extent.  In descending order, the repetition gets more annoying for: theme (e.g. PKD), universe (Banks), reused characters (Bujold), plot structure (your description of RCW), narrative voice (Wolfe), non-reused but indistinguisheable characters (Vance).  Of course SF&#39;s attempts to bow towards the new prevent them from reaching the heights achieved by fantasy in this area.  David Eddings, for instance, employed *all of the above* at once complete with a within-universe rationale for why things had to be that way.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-65174158-content"><p>Clever, funny in parts, but wrong.  The fact is Spin is a very good book and Blind Lake is not.  That&#39;s why you liked the former and disliked the latter.  Its not because you read one first.  I read The Chronoliths, Blind Lake, Bios, and Spin in that order and I loved Chronoliths and Spin and thought Bios and Blind Lake were mediocre.  I would have thought the same regardless of the order (although I might not have kept reading his stuff if I had not loved The Chronoliths).  The &quot;formula&quot; you discern is too complex to be a real &quot;formula&quot;.  I could go through and show all the differences but whats the point.  You could do the recipe trick for all but the very best &quot;literary&quot; novels I bet, and maybe even some of them.  </p>

<p>    If your complaint is that while Wilson aspires to merge the literary novel with the hard science fiction novel (see Paul De Filippo&#39;s thoughtful review of Spin), he, like Kim Standley Robinson, is ultimately a better genre writer than a literary beacon, I would say, no kidding.   That&#39;s why he received the Hugo Award but not the National Book Award, and why his name is Robert Charles Wilson and not Richard Powers.  But if you want thoughtful science fiction with relatively believable characters, elegant writing, well thought out and exectuted premises, you can&#39;t do much better than Wilson.    <br />

After an exhaustive survey this afternoon, I'm happy to inform you that, generally speaking, the answer is nothing. But damn do we ever do it self-consciously. The humble origins of future giants amused me most. Crooked Timber introduced itself with an apology for not apologizing and an admission of its insignificance: The bringing of a new blog before the public is a practice now so common as scarce to need an apology. Nevertheless, such lists, assemblages, diaries, complaints, lamentations, polemics and records of triumph and disaster are now so common and so diverse that new entrants into the field must perforce struggle to be noticed. Future Crooked Timber contributors but then unknown-expat-analytic-philosopher John Holbo and his AWOL ABD partner Belle Waring opened John &amp; Belle by declaring that they didn't &quot;want to look like big retards.&quot; They closed with a declaration of love for their &quot;sole reader.&quot; Compare that to John's holbonic first post on The Valve and you'll see the effect minor internet celebrity has on one's once humble ambitions. (Not uninteresting are the identities of the Valve's first two commenters. Similarly not uninteresting is the Crooked Timber post which gave birth to the Valve. Who wants to play &quot;Guess the Future Valve Contributors?&quot; Half of them are there from the get-go. I'm surprised John didn't ask Adam to join.) John had a plan. Other bloggers were bored. With nothing better to do at 10:13 p.m. one night in April 2002, Atrios asked the world &quot;Is this thing on?&quot; Exactly fifteen minutes later he wondered how long it will be until literally dozens of people are reading this on an almost monthly basis. At 12:37 a.m. on 6 July 2004, Bitch Ph.D. informed the world that The events are real. The thoughts are my own. But the names have been changed to protect the guilty and the innocent. Is there some significance to these late-night beginnings? Do some types of people start particular types of blogs while suffering from insomnia? This particular pairing suggests the answer's a firm &quot;No.&quot; (Then again, there does seem to be something to the fact that many conservative blogs are early morning births. They wake up one morning and decide to remake the world in their image. Someone has to make sure the trains run on time. Who better than them?) I've gathered many more examples, but I'm too tired to list 'em all tonight. Instead I'll point to the first post here, entitled &quot;Yes, But Is It Radical.&quot; In it, you'll note that my staunch support homosexuality had been temporarily overwhelmed by my loathing of hippies. An email had come over the departmental listserv indicating that there'd be a &quot;Radical Faerie&quot; retrospective on campus later that week and I couldn't contain myself. At the tail end of three months of chemotherapy . . . angry at the world and my place in it . . . I exploded. I threw up a test post...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/graduate_studen.html"><span><strong>Graduate Students Love Fun Too</strong> Over the CLCWEGSA1 listserv this afternoon I learned that a faculty member had graciously agreed to donate her old junk to furnish the future &quot;graduate student lounge.&quot; According to the email, &quot;She says she has a nice futon, some rungs, and a few more ideas to make it a more comfortable space.&quot; My first response? Thank the lady for luxurious ideas. But then I thought about her offer of &quot;rungs.&quot; Because what this graduate student community really needs is a jungle gym. Freshman have their &quot;fifteen.&quot; Graduate students know how to multiply. I decided that in addition to rungs, the Graduate Student Lounge of the Future could stand for some swings. Swinging invigorates both mind and body! If we're gonna have rungs and swings we oughta have monkey bars too. Sure there's something inherently racist about the African-American students swinging on the monkey bars, but who cares? I'm talking about monkey bars here people. Monkey Bars. What hunched graduate student wouldn't disavow Derrida after a few hours of monkey bar-induced glee? (Besides the closeted Republican one, since he obviously hates fun. Why else become Republican?) Nothing could improve a graduate student lounge with rungs and swings and monkey bars. Except a slide. So I sprung into action and formed the CLCWEGSA Wants Monkey Bars and a Slide Committee. Our first meeting is tomorrow. I anticipate the Swing Faction will complain about their marginalization. But don't worry. If they don't like it they can take a long slide down a short . . . slide.
