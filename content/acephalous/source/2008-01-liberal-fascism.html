It is considered doubtful whether the ... If the real murderers are not found it is improbable that the Italian troops will ever evacuate.</p></blockquote>

<p>Like Bush, Mussolini believed the free market can do anything the government do, only better and more efficiently:</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Mussolini Greets Business Congress, Tells the Delegates Paternalism Must Go and Capitalism Will Stay,&quot; <em>New York Times</em>, 19 March 1923</p>

<p>&quot;It is my conviction,&quot; said Signor Mussolini in his address, &quot;that the State must renounce its economic functions, especially those of a monopolistic character, for which it cannot provide.&nbsp; The Government must give free play to private enterprise, and must forego any measures of State control and State paternalism.&nbsp; Such measures may satisfy the demagogy and ambitions of Socialists, but as shown by experience, will in the long run turn out to be absolutely fatal to the interests and economic development of any country.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not believe the complex of forces which is known by the name of capitalism is about to end, as has for so long been announced by several extreme Socialist thinkers.&nbsp; Events have shown that all systems which interfere with initiative and individual impulse fail more or less in a short lapse of time.</p></blockquote>

<p>Like any neoconservative, inchoate or not, Mussolini wanted to privatize everything in sight:</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Mussolini Starts Drastic Reforms,&quot; <em>New York Times</em>, 3 November 1922</p>

<p>[T]he State will sell or lease to private enterprises all the State monopolies ... These include the parcel post, the telegraph, and the railways.</p></blockquote>

<p>He and Bush share a hatred of the Ivory Tower and a desire to defund the elitists who live in it:</p>

<blockquote><p>[T]he State will abolish ... all universities[.]</p></blockquote>

<p>And the poor are, of course, lazy.&nbsp; Something must be done about them:</p>

<blockquote><p>In any case [the State] will oblige the unemployed to go to the places where they can be usefully employed[.]</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the army can usefully employ them?&nbsp; If not, there's always the <em>other</em> army, a.k.a. &quot;Mussolini's Blackwater&quot;:</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Fascisti to Create Formidable Army,&quot; <em>New York Times</em>, 11 September 1930</p>

<p>&quot;The reform,&quot; said General Teruzzi, &quot;while it harks back to the origins and voluntary tradition of the corps, will inspire morale of the highest order, an augmenting of military efficiency, of perfect cohesion and of strict collaboration between the militia and the army.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>Gen. Teruzzi chose to announce these reforms on 9/11 for an important reason.&nbsp; Like Bush, Teruzzi and Mussolini know what the final page will say when history was written.&nbsp; If anyone dares suggest otherwise, the <em>fascisti</em> knew how to deal with the liberal media:</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Fascisti Leader Wins Duel With Communist Editor,&quot; <em>NY Times</em>, 27 October 1921</p>

<p>Etore Ciccotti, communist editor of Il Paese, was seriously wounded today in a duel with Professor Benito Mussolini, leader of the Fascisti.&nbsp; Swords were used.&nbsp; [...]&nbsp; 

It ended in the fourteenth bout, when the physicians pronounced Ciccotti to be in a serious condition and unable to continue the encounter.&nbsp; [...]&nbsp; A dispatch to The London Times from Milan says that it is believe that the duel between Signor Ciccotti and Signor Mussolini will be resumed tomorrow with pistols.</p>

<p>&quot;Mussolini Victor in a Duel,&quot; <em>NY Times</em>, 15 May 1922.</p>

<p>Professor Benito Mussolini, leader of the Fascisti, who bears more than 100 wounds received in battle, engaged in a duel yesterday with Signor Missiroli, editor of the Turin Secolo, over differences arising from articles appearing in their respective newspapers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ciccotti and Missiroli got off easy:</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Anti-Fascisti Lose Teeth,&quot; <em>New York Times</em>, 16 February 1923</p>

<p>A new and grotesque method of asserting their authority [has] been adopted by the Fascisti at Fiume.</p>

<p>Entering apartments, they forced residents to utter the national cry, &quot;Hail, Hail Italy!&quot;&nbsp; Those who refused to obey has some of their sound teeth pulled out.</p></blockquote>

<p>That's either O.G. waterboarding or special rendition for teeth.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; Doesn't matter.&nbsp; What was Mussolini to do, <em>not</em> act on actionable intelligence?</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Mussolini Busy Rounding up Reds,&quot; <em>New York Times</em>, 7 February 1923</p>

<p>The rumored discovery of a secret order from the Moscow International executive to Italian Reds to the effect that the Mussolini government must be overthrown and the Fascisti party disbanded by every means, has caused the government to adopt most drastic measures.&nbsp; Wholesale arrests of Reds are proceeding in the most important cities [and] a prominent leader of the Reds was found in possession of sterling and checks amounting to several thousand lire.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Ticking Nuke, people.&nbsp; <em>The Ticking Nuke</em>.&nbsp; What choice did he have?&nbsp; Like Bush, he had none but one:</p>

<p>Invade Iraq.&nbsp; What did Mussolini do?&nbsp; He invaded Ethiopia.&nbsp; Big mistake.&nbsp; In this sense, Bush is a <em>better </em>conservative fascist ... but I'll save that discussion for the book.</p>

<p>As you can tell from my very serious, thoughtful post, my argument about Conservative Fascism (&quot;From Mussolini to The Invisible Hands of Compassionate Conservatism and Fetuses&quot;) is one which has never been made in such detail or with such care as I will make it.&nbsp; I plan to erect a website <a href="http://liberalfascism.nationalreview.com/post/?q=M2M2ZWUyZGIzNDFhZjE2NzVlM2VjMDQxMjRkYzdmYzA=&amp;p=1">devoted to singing its praises</a> and a blog in which I'll do nothing but shamelessly <a href="http://liberalfascism.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTcyODA3NjA5NTcxMWYwNzc2ZDEyMzQ3NzU4MTkxZTU=">reprint</a> <a href="http://liberalfascism.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZmEyM2RkODQ5YWFhNzg5ODJjMjJjMzUwNGQyZDJiOTY=">embarrassingly</a> <a href="http://liberalfascism.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTFiYjkyMzU5ZjM3YWFjODI4NmZlNTQ4ODdhMTQ4Y2E=">sycophantic</a> <a href="http://liberalfascism.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZjA4N2U2ZmQ1NjJhYzhjZWIwNjc4MGExMzgzYzM2NmM=">letters</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Because you <em>know</em> you've Hit It Big Time when your words resonate with those ideologically disposed to agree with them.</p>

I sat at the computer writing or maybe just typing. Sometimes I listened to music I liked or laughed at something I read. Mostly I forwarded through songs that didn't move me and stared cross at idiots. Spent so many hours eyes wide and mouth agape I developed some conditions. Dry conditions. I tried to fix them with moisture but the root stupidity haunted me. I tried to write but could only type. Aware of the vultures circling above I vowed to continue writing or typing or whatever it was I was up to. Just as despair prepared to pin me on that dry mat I heard the dainty knuckles of a dame rapping on the door. I listened for a sharp tap of a ring the second time around and there it was. Married lady showing up here at this hour could only mean one thing ... [You continue below the fold.]</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/01/about-the-previ.html"><span><strong>About the Previous Liberal Fascism &quot;Post&quot; ...</strong> Wasn't meant to be one. Was what professional bloggers call a &quot;draft.&quot; Now that I think about it, that is what &quot;professional&quot; bloggers call a &quot;post&quot;: blustery quotations, predictable sarcasm and no original thought. I'm no professional blogger. But Jonah Goldberg is! You no doubt wonder why I continue to bother with this intellectual fraud. Has something to do with finishing the dissertation, with all the crossing of t's and dotting of i's I've performed these past few months. Bothers me someone could write something so crassly opportunistic and demand it be taken seriously. Bothers me more some people will oblige. Goldberg bathes in the adulation of those who know no better. Attend to the plaudits of the proud anti-intellectual! Witness the alexipharmic email he published this evening! You're a guy looking at two fish saying, &quot;They're the same thing: fish.&quot; [Michael Ledeen]'s the specialist in ichthyology saying, &quot;Nice try, but please. But this is a carp and the other is a haddock. The differences may be enumerated thusly ... &quot; That carp are freshwater fish and haddock saltwater matters not! &quot;Both are fish,&quot; Goldberg opines, &quot;and should be treated as such. All that is required to raise either is a saltwater tank and some fish food. What do you mean, have I raised them myself? They're both fish. All they need is fish-food and saltwater. Are you some kind of expert or something?&quot; When informed that his interlocutor is an expert, instead of demurring, Goldberg takes comfort in the ignorance of his readers. They know carp and haddock are both fish. They know all carp and haddock (being fish) need is fish-food and saltwater. &quot;What,&quot; they demand, &quot;could an ichthyologist possibly add to the conversation?&quot; To which the ichthyologist rejoins, &quot;Fewer dead fish. Better smelling tank. Cleaner filters. Edible food.&quot; Only expertise renders his opinion suspect. Experts distinguish when they should simplify. Imagine the headlines in Goldberg's ideal republic: &quot;Anti-Anti-Fascists Lose Teeth,&quot; New York Times, 16 February 2008 A new and grotesque method of asserting their authority [has] been adopted by the Anti-Fascisti at The Corner. Entering apartments, they force residents to utter the national cry, &quot;All Fish Are Fish, Are Fish, Are Fish!&quot; Those who refuse to obey have some of their sound teeth pulled out. Would that my dissertation could &quot;rise&quot; to Adam Bellow's &quot;high&quot; standards ...</span></a></div>
