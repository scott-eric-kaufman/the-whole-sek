			<p>When their parents tucked them into bed last night, conservatives 
knew they wouldn’t be able to sleep. Tomorrow was Benghazi Day! They’d 
been waiting all year and putting them to bed at 9:00 p.m. was nothing 
short of torture. They rolled away from the mocking light of their alarm
 clocks and tried to fall asleep for hours, but when they rolled back 
over the clock read 9:04 p.m. Four minutes!</p>
<p>How were they supposed to make it through the night? In a few hours it would be Benghazi Day, and even though <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/05/06/weekly-standard-accidentally-disproves-central/193917">they knew exactly what’s under the Benghazi tree</a>,
 their imaginations were running as wild as Muslims outraged by our 
freedom. Obama would be impeached! The Democrat Party disbanded! Niggers

enough!</p>
<p>They trembled like old men with weak bladders every time they thought
 they heard those whistles blow. But sleep would not come. Visions of 
dead Americans danced in their heads to the sweet sounds of a gavel 
calling liberals to order. They tried <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/05/08/Live-Updates-Benghazi-Hearing">counting lies</a> but quickly lost track of which ones were supposed to matter. They <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2013/05/08/open-thread-benghazi-hearing-in-house-oversight-committee/">thought about the video</a>
 but then thought better about thinking about it because it didn’t 
matter. All that mattered was that it was almost Benghazi Day!</p>
<p>They rushed downstairs and turned on the television. FOX was interviewing <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2013/05/08/cheney-on-benghazi-i-cannot-understand-why-they-werent-ready-to-go/">Benghazi Claus</a>! Happy day! He reminded them that “<a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2013/05/08/cheney-on-benghazi-i-cannot-understand-why-they-werent-ready-to-go/">when we were there, on our watch, we were always ready on 9/11</a>.”
 What an unexpected Benghazi Day present! They were so excited it took 
everything in their power not to shoot each other in the face.</p>
<p>But it was only 10:00 p.m. Benghazi Day was still hours away!</p>
<p>So they went on the Internet and spent the night <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/05/obamas-departure-predicted-as-congress-focuses-on-cover-up/?cat_orig=politics">writing fan-fiction</a>.
 When they fell asleep on their keyboards they dreamed of a border whose
 siren song beckoned illegals and liberals into its electrifying

What do I mean? A translation of last night’s episode, “For Immediate Release,” from their perspective should suffice: With the exception of Matt Zoller Seitz and a few others, the majority of responses to this episode have focused on how “satisfying” it was to see Don Draper behaving like Draper again. Meaning the majority of the people writing those responses are still watching the show primarily to experience the thrill of being a powerful white man. The episode, directed by the always excellent Jennifer Getzinger, undermines this reading at nearly every turn. Consider when Sterling announces that he’s landed SCDP a chance at Chevy after Don brushed off Jaguar: Pete Campbell upbraids Draper, saying “Don’t act like you had a plan, you’re Tarzan, swinging from vine to vine,” creating an image that would seem to correspond with the “appealing” white male narrative above. Draper isn’t just any powerful white man — he’s the walking-talking embodiment of early 20th Century theories of white male supremacy. Like Tarzan, he’s an orphan who cultivates the talents required to survive in a hostile and alien society; and like Tarzan, when he finds himself among “normal” people again, these talents appear superhuman to them. To become king of the apes he had to become more than just a man. In this particular context, Campbell’s insult almost reads like a compliment; however, this isn’t the first time this season we’ve encountered an ostensibly superior white man in a society of apes: For the second time in two weeks, the show demands we consider the hubris of a white man in the society “unworthy” of his talents. The reference to Tarzan in “For Immediate Release” only seems ambiguous if we conveniently forget that Draper’s mildly obsessed with a film whose premise is that no man — not even a white one on a world mad with apes — is beyond reproach. Campbell’s insult holds these two visions of white male supremacy in tension: Draper can only continue to feel superior if he deliberately forgets what he learned watching Planet of the Apes. Those critics who found this episode a “return to form” fail to realize that they’re taking comfort in a momentary resurgence of white male privilege — a momentary return to that Golden Age “when things just made sense” that conservatives reference every time a woman, person of color, or anyone under the age of forty-five decides to have an opinion. Wasn’t it grand when self-made men like Draper could impose their will on the world? The problem with finding “satisfaction” in this episode, then, is that it requires us to ignore the same things Draper does. Note how the medium shot of Campbell upbraiding him is composed: Draper, representing the old guard, is in the foreground, but he’s a face without a brain and out of focus; Campbell, Ken Cosgrove and Joan Harris, representing the generation after Draper’s, occupy the midground; and in the background is an...</span></a></div>

SEK’s listening, quite loudly, to the Replacements’ Tim, when he notices PORSCHE GUY seems to be having problems paying his $2.50 toll. PORSCHE GUY: I only have fifty cents. TOLL BOOTH ATTENDANT: It’s a $57.70 fine. PORSCHE GUY: I’m not going to pay that. PORSCHE GUY exits his car and slowly looks around. He turns to SEK, who turns “Bastards of Young” up even louder. PORSCHE GUY: HEY YOU! SEK: IT BEATS PICKING COTTON AND WAITING TO BE FORGOTTEN! PORSCHE GUY: I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME! SEK: (turns down music) What? PORSCHE GUY: Can I borrow $2? SEK: (looks at PORSCHE GUY’s Porsche while the fuel injector on his one-eyed Taurus sputters) Sorry. Don’t have it. PORSCHE GUY: How were you doing the tolls then? SEK: (realizing PORSCHE GUY knows some logic) I have $5 and change. Just enough to get me to work. PORSCHE GUY: Can I borrow it? SEK: I have just enough to get to work. PORSCHE GUY: Great. You can pay it forward. SEK: I don’t think that’s how that works. PORSCHE GUY: Are you a religious man? SEK: Not remotely. PORSCHE GUY: Because I am. I believe in Christian charity. SEK: (looking at PORSCHE GUY’s Porsche) I can tell. PORSCHE GUY: Great! PORSCHE GUY gets back in his car and talks to the TOLL BOOTH ATTENDANT. Both point at SEK, who vigorously waves his arms in an improvised semaphore of “NO NO NO.” PORSCHE GUY sticks his head out his window and turns to SEK. PORSCHE GUY: Jesus pays you forward! God bless! PORSCHE GUY speeds off. SEK pulls up to the toll booth and is informed by TOLL BOOTH ATTENDANT that he’d agreed to cover PORSCHE GUY’s toll. She also informs him that if he doesn’t pay the PORSCHE GUY forward, she’ll be docked for the difference. SEK hands over $5.00 and heads to class.</span></a></div>
