In the clinical sense, Click is the more interesting case because she thinks that the only problem with her cartoon is that it’s racist. I repeat: she drew a cartoon in which the punch line is a gang rape and the only potential problem with it she can see is that it might be racist. Don’t misunderstand me: it’s plenty racist—plays into tropes as old as slavery and everything—but the punch line is that the President and his associates are going to gang-rape the Statue of Liberty with, I kid you not, immigration reform. In service of the cheapest of laughs, Click asserts that the statue that symbolizes America’s commitment to the tired, poor, huddled masses of the world is about to be raped because of the President’s commitment to those selfsame masses-yearning-to-be-free. Talk about your industrial grade ideological incoherence—and I would, except for the fact that Goldstein, never one to be upstaged on his own blog, told a woman that the only way she would ever be cool was if someone raped her with an icicle. That’s not true, though. Goldstein never said that. What he said, and I quote, was: For instance, here’s Nishi, whose only hope of ever really touching cool would be to pay somebody to fuck her once with an ice dong. Such are the depths to which Goldstein sinks to maintain the illusion that he’s cool, which is sad, you know, because he’s a middle-aged man worried about whether people think he’s cool. Then, in yet another example of just how over me he is, he declares me to be the exemplar of uncool. Far be it for me, a 32-year-old blogger who sports a backwards Mets cap and is currently writing a scholarly book about comics, to complain when someone says I’m not cool, because honestly, I’m not cool. I grew up, got a job, and am working for the Man; however, forty-something bloggers who alternate between whining about how poorly jobs they don’t have pay and writing 10,000-word-long semiotic screeds about Alinksy and catch-wrestling? Not cool. Doesn’t matter how many people whose favorite film is Mr. Smith Goes to Washington say otherwise, because them? Also not cool. But you know what really, really isn’t cool? Unsubtle threats of politically motivated violence against women: I predict Nishi will look very surprised the first time she’s knocked down by someone who doesn’t much like the glee she takes in the losses of freedom we’re undergoing.

 is <em>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</em> say otherwise, because them? <em>Also
 not cool</em>. But you know what really, <em>really</em> isn’t cool? 
Unsubtle <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=17380#comment-878217">threats</a>
 of politically motivated violence against women:</p>
<blockquote><p>I predict Nishi will look very surprised the first time 
she’s knocked down by someone who doesn’t much like the glee she takes 
in the losses of freedom we’re undergoing.</p>
<p>I predict Nishi won’t have as much fun playing the griefer game once 
it becomes obvious that while she’s playing a game, many of us are not.</p>
<p>I predict that Nishi doesn’t know who she’s fucking with.</p>
<p>I predict Nishi will soon find it best not to post here anymore.</p>
<p>I predict that I don’t much care about “blogging” anymore; I care 
about my family and my family’s future, and I see barren narcissists 
like Nishi as threats to my family—all because they get their kicks 
seeing how much they can connive their way into control and power.</p>
<p>I predict having such an attitude as Nishi’s will turn out badly.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m sure my pointing this out will result in a cool discussion about 
the coolest of abstruse literary theories—intentionalism—and about how I
 don’t get what Goldstein intended there, and I’d care, you know, but <em>whatever</em>.</p><p><strong>Update. </strong>Surprisingly for someone who is so over me, Goldstein 
just devoted an <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=17414" mce_href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=17414">entire post</a> to refuting
 my argument—I kid, I kid.&#0160; He makes fun of my beard and completely 
ignores the fact that, as <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/03/what-do-you-do-in-the-wake-of-a-crushing-political-defeat/comment-page-1#comment-38039" mce_href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/03/what-do-you-do-in-the-wake-of-a-crushing-political-defeat/comment-page-1#comment-38039">Jay</a> and <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/03/what-do-you-do-in-the-wake-of-a-crushing-political-defeat.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef01310fd8e479970c#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01310fd8e479970c">Rich</a> noted, the rape of Lady Liberty trope is so tired that the <em>Onion</em> uses 
it as a running [<em>insert scary minority here</em>] gag.&#0160; He also refers
 to Click&#39;s depiction of the moments after non-consensual sex as a 
&quot;metaphor,&quot; which it would only be were it not actually a depiction of 
the moments after non-consensual sex.&#0160; A picture of a cute puppy isn&#39;t a
 metaphor for a picture of a cute puppy, it <em>is </em>a picture of a 
cute puppy for the simple reason that things can&#39;t be metaphors for what
 they are.&#0160; Click produced a very literal depiction of what might 
otherwise be a metaphor, but it&#39;s not a metaphor: it&#39;s a drawing of a 
callous rapist informing his victim that he&#39;s coming back from more.</p><p><strong>Update II. </strong>By request, as a few of you mistakenly believe that
 Click can experience shame and will take down her cartoon shortly, I&#39;ll
 report it here:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/liberty_sml.jpg" mce_href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/liberty_sml.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6397 " height="342" mce_src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/liberty_sml.jpg" src="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/liberty_sml.jpg" title="liberty_sml" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>See how that&#39;s a &quot;metaphor&quot; for a violent rape, and not a depiction 
of the aftermath of one?&#0160; Of course you do.</p>

<p><em>Bring back the comics analysis and deft pedagogical anecdotage</em>.</p>

<p>More pedagogy next week, once the Spring Quarter starts.  This is my one week off until the end of June.  More comic stuff, however, is in the pipes, I just haven&#39;t finalized it yet.  Stick around, I promise there&#39;ll be more of the fun stuff shortly.</p>

<p>happy:</p>

<p><em>I thought the rape was more like a metaphor. Like when you say someone&#39;s murdered hope you don&#39;t mean for reals they&#39;re a murderer.</em></p>

<p>It is a metaphor, at least until you make it not one, which is what Darlene did.  If you literalize it by having Lady Liberty crying naked on a bed and President Obama putting his clothes on and telling her he&#39;ll be back with friends, it&#39;s not a metaphor anymore: it&#39;s the thing itself.  She depicted the aftermath of nonconsensual sex, which is rape.  Click probably thinks that mentioning that she consented two Novembers ago absolves her of that, just like husbands can&#39;t rape their wives because they&#39;re married; which, however, is patently untrue.</p>

<p><em>but there is animosity in your post, no?</em></p>

<p>Actually, there isn&#39;t.  There&#39;s quite a bit of it in Jeff&#39;s aggressively formulated posts and comments, but I&#39;m actually perfectly fine with not being cool.  It&#39;s just sad to see someone have to argue that they&#39;re cool, which when you think about it, pretty much guarantees you&#39;re not.  </p>

<p><em>I think the thing I would key in on is the expression of concern what is voiced about the losing of the freedoms.</em></p>

<p>True enough, but I don&#39;t see that I&#39;ve lost any.  </p>

<p>Karl:</p>

<p><em>isn&#39;t the Statue of Liberty ALREADY anthropomorphized?</em></p>

<p>The only question is, then, an anthropomorphized <em>what</em>?</p>

<p>Rich:</p>

<p><em>Their book Our Dumb Century includes a running bit that, to quote wiki, parodies &quot;newspaper fear-mongering by drawing a caricature of America&#39;s enemy du jour (among them, Spaniards, Nazis and hippies) [sexually] assaulting an anthropomorphized Statue of Liberty.&quot; </em></p>

<p>The fact that it&#39;s a running gag <em>about racists</em> would, you think, undermine Click&#39;s argument that there&#39;s no racial angle to it.  But, you know, it won&#39;t.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a973931f970b-content"><p>A crushing political defeat?  Crushing?  13% of the Democrats in the House defected; 59% of the American people are against (or, charitably, confused about) Obama&#39;s plan.  Neustadt, who should be taken seriously in these matters, wrote that &quot;The power of the President is the power to persuade.&quot;  Who did President Obama successfully persuade, exactly?  Remember, the big topic of discussion prior to passage was whether Speaker Pelosi was going to use a parliamentary technique to allow her party to avoid direct responsibility.</p>

<p>Maybe you can explain to me how, exactly, were the Republicans supposed to &quot;win&quot; given that they didn&#39;t have control over any of the political branches?  It&#39;s a defeat, sure, but more Thermopylae or Dunkirk.  In other words, if you have to lose, the Republicans did it in the best way possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-03-15/the-decision-that-changed-the-dems/full/" rel="nofollow">I think that Beinart identifies the cleavage in the Democratic party aptly.</a>  In any case, the true determination of what this defeat, crushing or otherwise, really means will come in November.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef01310fda946c970c-content"><p>Beinart&#39;s analysis is moronic.  Obama didn&#39;t &quot;[choose] Karl Rove’s politics of base mobilization over Dick Morris’s politics of crossover appeal, &quot;  He tried to use crossover appeal over and over, and only gave up when it was apparent, even to him, that it wasn&#39;t going to work.  He didn&#39;t then reluctantly agree to pass the bill because he was choosing a politics of base mobilization -- he did so because he ran on health care reform, and he needed to accomplish at least one of his major promises.</p>

<p>Sure, Obama performed miserably.  Which doesn&#39;t make it any less of a crushing defeat for the Republicans.  They failed to stop something that, at least according to their own strategists, is going to turn the middle class firmly against them for a generation.  You can&#39;t argue that it was inevitable that they were going to lose because they had lost all the branches of government when just until recently they were claiming they were going to win.</p></span>

<p>The closest analog that immediately occurred to me, mostly because it involved an hitherto unheard of use of presidential rhetoric, was Wilson and the debate over the League of Nations.

<p>&quot;59% of the American people are against (or, charitably, confused about) Obama&#39;s plan.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s last week&#39;s figure.  <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/126929/Slim-Margin-Americans-Support-Healthcare-Bill-Passage.aspx" rel="nofollow">Get with the program, man!</a></p>

<p>&quot;Who did President Obama successfully persuade, exactly?&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/22/AR2010032203729.html?hpid=topnews&sid=ST2010032304326" rel="nofollow">Happy to be of service.</a></p>

<p>&quot;In any case, the true determination of what this defeat, crushing or otherwise, really means will come in November.&quot;</p>

<p>I have no idea if you&#39;re a Republican or not, but this strikes me as perfectly-distilled Republican thinking.  Democrats have just achieved the most sweeping domestic legislative accomplishment in at least the last four presidencies, one that&#39;s been a Democratic priority for some sixty years…but if they lose a midterm election, that&#39;s what will <i>really</i> matter.  Republicans really are interested solely in politics, not at all in policy.</p></span>

<p>Well, I don&#39;t see where Happyfeet said that, but it&#39;s true nonetheless.  There&#39;s a running joke where a liberal will point to something awful that Limbaugh, or Beck, or some Republican Congressman said, and a conservative will respond, &quot;Oh yeah?  Well, here&#39;s a link to a blog commenter on YOUR side saying the same thing!&quot; as if a blog commenter and a Limbaugh or a Bachmann were comparable figures.  But Click really <i>is</i> a blog commenter, or rather the next step up the food chain.  I&#39;m sure Day by Day has some idiotic take on this too, but what&#39;s the point?

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a9750596970b-content"><p>So, I&#39;m British.  My personal political biases aside, it is the case that the National Health Service is one of the very few things that everybody over here, left-wing and right-wing, agrees is A Vitally Good Thing.  When the Tories get back into power, as they will in May, they may well roll back the State in many areas: they probably will slash unemployment benefit, privatize pensions, cut local grants; they may privatise the universities and smash the BBC.  If they do so, some will oppose them bitterly, and some will applaud them energetically.  But I offer his copper-bottomed prediction: they will not privatise the NHS because that would alienate the <i>entire</i> electorate.  It&#39;s such a palpable good, and it or something like it so palpably <i>works</i> in almost every country in the world outside America that I&#39;ve watched the enormous kerfuffle on your side of the pond with frank astonishment.</p>

<p>I mean, I understand liberty is one of the big three Foundationally-American things, but those things are ranked, no?  Life comes before both liberty and the pursuit of happiness; and the point of free-at-point-of-use healthcare is, precisely, to safeguard everybody&#39;s life and quality of life.</p>

<p>That said, I still don&#39;t understand the ire, here.  The barb is that Obama has done something without consent.  What has he done?  Assuming the cartoonist isn&#39;t so shallow as to think &#39;this bill passed without <i>my individual</i> consent, and that is tantamount to passing without the consent of the entirety of America&#39;; and assuming nobody is confusing &#39;democratic consent&#39; with &#39;absolute unanimity&#39;, I&#39;m at a loss to see how a man elected President by a democratic majority on the promise of delivering public healthcare, who then passes a healthcare bill through the democratically elected legislature, has done anything non-consensual.  There are (as I understand it) opinion polls suggesting that a slim majority oppose the bill, and also polls suggesting that a slim majority support it.  Is the point here &#39;by ignoring the particular opinion poll that coincides with my personal position, Obama is raping American Liberty&#39;?  Surely it can&#39;t be anything so crass.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a baffled Anglo, I&#39;m afraid.</p></span>

A fair majority of Americans opposed the bill prior to passage, but that&#39;s because some felt it didn&#39;t go far enough, whereas a sizable chunk felt it went too far. Add the &#39;not far enough&#39; to the &#39;bill&#39;s ok&#39; set and you get a minority of Americans opposed to the bill and a majority who want AT LEAST the bill at this moment making its way through the reconciliation process. Even a dipshit like Wolf Blitzer&#39;s figured that one out, finally.</p>

<p>Adam, it&#39;s a mystery to me too. I&#39;ve had various facebook arguments with family who believe that this is the first step towards, essentially, the eschaton. The math is sort of underpants gnomey (famously: &#39;1) steal underpants; 2)? 3) profit&#39;). I suppose it has something to do with liberty, or somesuch,and a mistaken sense of the frontier and self-made men. Of course, we postmodernists have put a stop to such nonsense by our critique of the liberal subject, but some people just haven&#39;t received the memo yet.</p>

<p>Arguments against the health care bill are either patently political (and unprincipled), objecting as they do to things Republicans did themselves during the Gingrich years or between 2002-2006, or incorrect (&#39;no one&#39;s ever been compelled to buy goods or services to be a legal resident of the US&#39;: ask my foreign colleagues, who have to buy health insurance to be legal residents of the US), or just flat out reactionary readings of the Constitution&#39;s Commerce Clause. The latter arguments I&#39;m more willing to entertain, but I&#39;d like to see a chart of the effect of returning the commerce clause to its, say, c. 1940 or 1920 interpretation. C</p>

<p>Scott, &#39;anthropomorphized Statue...of liberty.&#39; hmmm. Now my head&#39;s spinning.</p></span>

He honestly believes that because some people on the left are sexist or racist, everyone on the right is morally superior despite, you know, supporting policies designed to protect the interests of white males. In this case, his ire is raised by a New York Post article about the casting call for the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean movie: The filmmakers sent out a casting call last week seeking “beautiful female fit models. Must be 5ft7in-5ft8in, size 4 or 6, no bigger or smaller. Age 18-25. Must have a lean dancer body. Must have real breasts. Do not submit if you have implants.” And they warn that there’ll be a “show and tell” day. To make sure LA talent scouts don’t get caught in a “booby trap,” potential lassies will have to undergo a Hollywood-style jiggle-your-jugs test and jog for judges. Nolte is outraged on behalf of surgically-enhanced women everywhere: This isn’t some sleazy porn peddler in the valley doing this, this is…Disney. DISNEY is going to subject and exploit young women desperate to be stars to the indignity of a booby ”show and tell.” DISNEY is going to have them jog in place for producers and casting agents in order to keep score of the bounciness of their breasts. Not only is this a case of discrimination against women whose only crime was undergoing a dangerous surgical procedure in order to enhance their appeal to sexists like Nolte, it involves a particularly dehumanizing &quot;booby 'show and tell'&quot; in which woman will be asked to &quot;jog in place for producers and casting agents in order to keep score of the bounciness of their breasts.&quot; How does he know this? It says so right in the actual, unexpurgated casting call: Must be 5'7-5'8, Size four or six - no bigger or smaller. Age 18 to 25. Must have a lean dancer body. Must have real breasts. Do not submit if you have implants. This is a show and tell of costumes with the director and the producers. Plan on an entire day of trying on clothes and being photographed. Sticklers might insist that the prepositional phrase &quot;of costumes&quot; modifies &quot;show and tell,&quot; and that there's nothing in the casting call about actresses being asked to &quot;jog in place&quot; so producers and casting can &quot;keep score of the bounciness of their breasts.&quot; Since it's not in the casting call, where did this idea of a &quot;booby 'show and tell'&quot; in which a parade of topless women jiggle only what the good Lord gave them come from? Where else? The imagination of John Nolte. The man can't even defend hypothetical women without undressing them in his mind. This...</span></a></div>

I have a confession: I have never watched or listened to Glenn Beck for any sustained period of time. I’d read transcriptions of his rambling monologues and seen parodies of his lunatic shtick, but until today, I’d avoided prolonged exposure to the Glenn Beck Experience. Would that I could still say the same. As a public service to anyone else out there who might be tempted to try and understand his appeal, I offer the following transcript of the horrors I witnessed condensed down to their rhetorical appeals: Good evening, America, I am you. Do you know what you hate? Let me tell you: You hate it when people tell you what to think. Do you want to be told what to think? Let me tell you: You don’t. You hate it when people tell you what to think. You’re an independent thinker, and what do all independent thinkers hate? Let me tell you: You hate to be told what to think, because you're an independent thinker. How should you feel about being told what to think? Let me tell you: You should feel insulted by these people who are telling you what to think. What does being talked down to by Washington elites make you feel like? Let me tell you: Being talked down to by Washington elites makes you feel like a child. How should you feel when Washington elites treat you like a child? Let me tell you: You should be outraged that Washington elites are trying to tell you how to live your life. How should you live your life? Let me tell you: You should live your life with freedom, because you're an independent thinker. What should you do when condescending Washington elites treat you and other independents just like you like children? Let me tell you: You should buy my book, because you're an independent thinker, and my book tells independent thinkers what they think. To be honest, I expected something more. I assumed Jon Stewart’s parody of Beck was a parody, but I was wrong—the Glenn Beck shows demonstrates that a significant number of American adults have the intellectual maturity of a punk apologist insisting that until you listen their favorite band, you’ll never learn to think for yourself. I honestly expected Beck to possess more rhetorical savvy than a teenage version of myself, but if you replace “America” with “the Replacements,” the resemblance is uncanny. (Before you say anything: I understand that I’m so late to the party that I shouldn’t even bother posting this, but I’ll risk inevitable redundancy in order to register the magnitude of my shock.)</span></a></div>
