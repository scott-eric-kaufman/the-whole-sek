			<p>When I read Scott Thomas' &quot;<a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc_posts.mhtml?i=20070723&amp;s=diarist072307">Shock Troops</a>,&quot; it didn't ring inauthentic.&nbsp; I've taught the memoirs and novels of Vietnam veterans and what Thomas described was tame in comparison.&nbsp; So imagine my surprise when I learned that the right <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2007/07/shock-troops.html">had gone apoplectic</a> over Thomas' comparatively sedate column.&nbsp; He hadn't document the violation of fundamental human rights, nor had he spoken of atrocities committed by American troops.&nbsp; All he'd communicated was the lengths some soldiers will go to remain sane in the heat of war.&nbsp; </p>

<p>From <em>our </em>perspective, the private who wore part of a human skull under his helmet is almost inhuman.&nbsp; From <em>his </em>perspective—<em>i.e. </em>from the perspective of someone who wakes up every morning knowing the odds of him ending someone else's life are comparable to those someone else will end his—his disrespect for the dead commingles with the profound disrespect for Death instilled in those who kill in our name.&nbsp; Their reluctance to revere our monuments to life is what makes them effective killers; moreover, it is what allows them to return home thoroughly disconnected from the monsters they had to become to kill.&nbsp; </p>

<p>They are not horrible people.&nbsp; They are who we have made them.&nbsp; They are who we need them to be.&nbsp; </p>

<p>So please, <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2007/07/26/scott-thomas-steps-out-of-the-shadows/">Mrs. Malkin</a>, stop with the sanctimonious bullshit.&nbsp; You've been to Iraq.&nbsp; You know these men suffer.&nbsp; Spare them your feigned outrage.&nbsp; They're trying to cope.&nbsp; Permit them their poor taste.&nbsp; Permit them to thumb their nose at the mean deaths they bring by flipping their finger at the mean death they fear.</p>

<p>Dan, stop <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=9513">tarring </a><em><a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=9513">The New Republic</a> </em>for allowing a soldier to tell what happens in a combat zone.&nbsp; Whatever you say about him, grant him the courage of his convictions—he is no armchair liberal, and even if he were, deployed as he is, he has learned quickly and rudely the lessons of war.&nbsp; His humor belongs to the soldier, to the gallows; respect it for being won hard, and at a price well beyond the means of our outrage.</p>

<p>Jeff, he may be an &quot;<a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=9511">antiwar opportunist</a>,&quot; but that doesn't mean he's not a soldier.&nbsp; That doesn't mean he wouldn't lay down his life for the men he fights beside.&nbsp; Say what you will about the intentions of men who go to war—I've known more I care to count at this point—who they become when they get there changes them forever.&nbsp; They don't become flag-waving patriots, nor do they embrace the <em>casus bellum </em>unthinkingly; but they <em>do </em>feel the bond only felt by those who, together, violated the code of the very society they kill to defend.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The life of a grunt is difficult enough.&nbsp; Stop piling it on.</p>

		<span id="comment-77308750-content"><p>Quite simply, because I&#39;ve read hundreds of memoirs of Vietnam vets, and recognize the style Thomas was self-consciously imitating.  Do you mean to tell me that what he says isn&#39;t true simply because it belongs to a well-established (and well-respected) tradition of war-reportage?  I doubt it.  My point is simply that nothing he said screams bullshit; that, in fact, it corresponds with what I&#39;ve read and heard from Vietnam, Gulf War, and Afghanistan/Iraq veterans.  And that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s damaging in any respect.  They <em>have no choice but to be a little dehumanized</em>; after all, what they&#39;re doing is quite literally <em>inhumane</em>.  Necessary, but inhumane.  If you castigate them for their gallows humor; if you make it seem as if what they need to do to survive&#39;s beyond the pale, well then, now you&#39;re the one who&#39;s inhumane.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-77309776-content"><p>I&#39;m sorry, Scott, if my perception of what constitutes verisimilitude differs from yours, if my estimate of the relative humanity of American soldiers in Iraq differs from yours, if I think that it is appalling that TNR has enabled this young idiot, who was writing the tales he&#39;s dispatching from Baghdad before he got there--not for the experience of proving what he thought was right, but in order to gain the credentials to underwrite what he knew beforehand it would be, and that he would be rewarded for it.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I am appalled that what is presented as diary has so little basis in fact, that the burned face woman somehow supernaturally appeared in his blog writings before he went over, that TNR has fallen for a Piltdown Man that they paid to have created before it was buried.  I&#39;m sorry that you feel that I am apoplectic over it, because that&#39;s really not how I feel right now.  I burned through my outrage some time ago.  Right now, I find this thing delightfully amusing, even though I realize that it&#39;s in bad taste, and that serious people like Malkin and the Captain would recognize in that my terribly vitiated sensibilities.</p>

		<span id="comment-77310266-content"><p>No, my belief that what he says is, shall we say, highly embellished, comes from the reportage of numerous milbloggers and his own command. </p>

<p>Specifically, the burned woman is a mystery to many people who have served at FOB Falcon in the time period described, including the command. And yet, Beauchamp tells us that she&#39;s a regular in the chow hall. How is it that all of these other people on a relatively small post with but one dining facility manage to have never seen this hideous damaged woman that Beauchamp and his friends mocked? </p>

<p>Another issue is the running dogs over with a Bradley account. First, the driver is not autonomous, and one does not joyride in a Bradley. Secondly, should one do such things, exposing the entire crew to the threat of roadside IED&#39;s, not to mention being tossed around said Bradley, he&#39;d get his ass kicked by the crew for foolishly risking their lives and then he&#39;d face disciplinary action from the vehicle&#39;s commander. </p>

<p>He also says that they&#39;d hit a dog and <i>dragged</i> it. A Bradley will not drag anything under its tracks. Links drop in the front and are picked up in the rear. While on the ground, they&#39;re stationary. They&#39;re tracks, not wheels. You can get squished, but without an inhuman effort to get caught in the drive, you can&#39;t possibly get dragged. </p>

<p>I completely understand that black humor will get you through some truly awful times. But this is something else that simply doesn&#39;t ring true, not only to me but to those in a much better place to make such determinations than either of us. Beauchamp is writing fiction of the very same sort he was writing about Iraq before he&#39;d ever set foot there. </p>

<p>You ignored my question regarding Dr. Barnes. Please respond to it. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-77312354-content"><p>Dan and Pablo, I&#39;m with Marc on this one.  True or not, the American people have a long history of despising the actions of the teens they&#39;ve sent to die.  I&#39;m not excusing atrocities here, but I&#39;m <em>absolutely, positively</em> absolving them of any responsibility for uncouth or infelicitous behavior.  Their standards aren&#39;t ours, because they served in our stead.  They&#39;re not monsters, not inhuman, only men and women, barely adults, thrust into circumstances they can&#39;t rationalize away.  So they laugh at the dead.  So what?  You think they could live with themselves in our society without some distance from what they&#39;d done to protect it?  I don&#39;t.  Isn&#39;t a matter of just this case, merely one of acknowledging that war alters all, and that anyone who can&#39;t recognize that is...I won&#39;t even say.  But it ain&#39;t good.  </p>

<p>Another way to say this: the automatic disbelief on the part of Ace and Malkin is disingenuous in the extreme, or if not, idiotic beyond belief.  They <em>should</em> know what war does to people -- after all, they&#39;ve vigorously supported it in all its contemporary guises -- but if they don&#39;t, if they belief that war doesn&#39;t dehumanize, or that what Thomas wrote was unbelievable, then there&#39;s a larger problem with those who so easily call for war without understanding the stakes of doing so.  Needless to say, they&#39;re <em>not</em> supporting the troops, no matter what they say.</p></span>

<p>No, Pablo: it doesn&#39;t fit my expectations of <em>this</em> war, or <em>its</em> soldiers, but of <em>any</em> war I&#39;ve ever studied, <em>any</em> conflict I&#39;ve read about.  Let me reiterate: what they&#39;ve done is well within the bounds of believability, and the fact that you deny that tells me that you haven&#39;t read many frank war memoirs.  Remember, I&#39;m not disparaging the troops: I&#39;m outraged by the fact that you seem to deny the psychological toll war takes upon a soldier, the little dehumanizations which allow him or her to do a job.  This isn&#39;t that complicated, Pablo: war alters all, and it&#39;s something we need to deal with, lest we do to this generation of vets what we did to those unfortunate enough to return from Vietnam.  For the sake of the troops, don&#39;t become the &#39;70s Left you revile.</p></span>

<p>I&#39;ll pose the same question I asked you on PW. What is this knee-jerk dismissal/automatic disbelief? Please quote a bit of it. The vast majority of what I&#39;ve seen debunking this comes from milbloggers and Beauchamp&#39;s command. Where is the out-of-hand dismissal?</p>

<p>And again, please offer an explanation as to how Barnes pegged Beauchamp so very closely. </p></span>

<p>Stop debating, Pablo.  You <em>know</em> that some men break in war, while others merely bend.  That&#39;s a necessary consequence of asking people to kill strangers, and those military ought not be vilified for being a little off-kilter after having done so.

Pablo, the magical semiotics man insisted that this writer was an MFA student.  Now that we know that he apparently isn&#39;t, what did the magic semiotics man actually get right?

		<span id="comment-77316886-content"><blockquote>Let&#39;s say the guy made all these incidents up. So we have a storm of tar-and-feathering from the Keyboard Kommandoes of an actual soldier serving in Iraq,</blockquote>

<p>Uh, no. What we have is other soldiers serving in Iraq, including his command, debunking those stories, and people not serving there relating that information. </p>

<blockquote>Pablo, the magical semiotics man insisted that this writer was an MFA student. Now that we know that he apparently isn&#39;t, what did the magic semiotics man actually get right?</blockquote>

<p>No, he got that right too. Barnes said:</p>

<blockquote>Based on a mix of semiotic analysis and my seat of the pants experience as a frequent reader of professional and near-professional writing by new writers, my guess is this: I think &quot;Scott Thomas&quot; is actually an MFA writing student, or a recent graduate of such a program, probably with some military experience – he may be serving in some non-combat specialty in Iraq – probably from one of the elite MFA programs, the twenty or so from which college creative writing faculty and small-press staff come disproportionately.</blockquote>

<p>And we then find that:</p>

<blockquote>“Glenn is completely submerged in politics on campus. It is honestly impossible to think about politics at MU without thinking of Glenn,” <b>says Scott Beauchamp, editor-in-chief of Prospectus, a liberal campus news magazine.</b> Beauchamp and Rehn met one year ago while campaigning for Howard Dean.</blockquote>

<p>Beauchamp is/was a student of writing, and given that the article linked was written by his wife, I say we give it credence. And as for Barnes, you know he&#39;s on your side, right?</p>

<blockquote>I suppose I wish Foer well.  He&#39;s got a long life ahead of him and right now he&#39;s way up a tree and that looks like a long fall.  But I can&#39;t help thinking that the sooner he falls out of that tree, the better for all of us on the left, and maybe for the country as a whole.</blockquote>

Luckily, today I chanced by accident upon a monograph which shows me exactly and precisely what I must not do if I hope to finish this chapter (and I do). What I must not do is define my terms in the affirmative, because as everyone knows (and they do), everyone else has preconceived notions of what words mean—especially when they refer to concepts instead of things—which means that if I wish to be precise to an exact degree, I must specify both what my words mean and what they decidedly don't. In order to make this relevant, I will replace the actual name of the monograph I chance upon with one under more frequent discussion in the present moment of the now, i.e. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: The print market in which [Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows] appears may be described as an &quot;open&quot; system. By this I do not mean that it is a self-regulating totality that sustains some essential character through the sort of homeostasis that is characteristic of, for example, many biological systems. The print market is a system of production and consumption in which no one can control or guarantee the meanings that sweep through its texts. It is open to seismic shifts and dislocations ... The market for [Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows] isn't analogously biological but geological, a fine distinction of precision which takes the better part of three whole entire paragraphs to draw. To think that all this time I've been arguing affirmatively! I could've been done, finished and completed by now had I but begun by demonstrating everything my every claim was not. If only I believed in a next life, this would all have been worthwhile.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/07/things-did-you-.html"><span><strong>If I Were Lawyer You Would Meet Me in Court and We Would Yell Words</strong> Things you did not know about the name that you have stolen of Acephalous include that it belongs to band that no less than Metal Review said that of their album Divine Purity that it is &quot;45 minutes of blackened, brutal melodeath&quot;? I knew that there was a band named &quot;Acephalous,&quot; but I was not aware that I had stolen their name, nor that they play &quot;blackened, brutal melodeath.&quot; Did you know Acephalous whose name you use combines what Ultimate Metal called &quot;old Sacramentum meets Alf Svensson era At The Gates coupled with an accessible flare more common to the newer wave of death metal and deathcore acts&quot;? You may as well be speaking another language. Did you know Metal Fan reviewed the album to say &quot;Heugelijk nieuws van onze zuiderburen: de Belgische undergroundscène zit de laatste tijd behoorlijk in de lift. Een lift die qua spooksferen niet onderdoet voor de lift uit Stephen King's Overlook en qua bruutheid voor de lift van Dick Maas. Nu toko's als Shiver Records en Rotten To The Core behoorlijk uitpakken is het oogstseizoen van verdienstelijke Belgische metal in volle gang. Hoe mooi is dat?!&quot; Now you are speaking another language. Care to get to the point? True metal fans do not appreciate the thievery which you have done to this deathcore group which their furiously riffing style. You take their original name but do not say so anywhere on your website. You should be shamed of yourself for stealing on the reputation of the band who played Divine Purity. If I were lawyer you would meet me in court and we would yell words. I feel a little guilty laughing at someone who, in the end, reveals himself to be a non-native speaker whose (infrequent) grammatical sentences are borrowed from the English portions the blog on Acephalous' Myspace. But then I read the reviews written on Acephalous' Myspace and remember: Mockery can be mighty entertaining. The unintentionally humorous bits of my anonymous correspondent's email are entertaining enough; however, the actual reviews of Divine Purity are infinitely more so. Witness the faux-intellectuality of the modern metalhead: Thus it should not be surprising that Acephalous' main method of attack is based around relentless counterpoint tremolo picked riffing. And it is here where the band is clearly the most comfortable as the melodies and combinations that result therein are greatly satisfying. Thus the result of the pretension of this review is therein greatly satisfying indeed. Then there's the undergraduate-essayist-cum-music-reviewer: Beginning a review with a definition can be cliché, but in the case of Belgium's Acephalous, it's too interesting to pass up. From the American Heritage Dictionary, via Dictionary.com, acephalous means: Biology Headless or lacking a clearly defined head: acephalous worms. Having no leader. See? Very interesting. Indeed! But my favorite review comes from &quot;FYU&quot;: I'm a bit ashamed to admit it but until now I never had heard of this band before. So when I got this album in the mail and looked at the drawing...</span></a></div>
