It looks something like this: Only with more words. The first of which look like this: The fifth season of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; is an exercise in aggressive nostalgia. &quot;Ozymandias,&quot; lauded by many as one of the strongest hours in television history ten minutes in, is especially committed to reminding the audience how different the world these characters inhabit is. It opens with a flashback that doubles as a classic &quot;process&quot; shot, an extreme close-up a cook flask. But this is no ordinary flashback. This flashback is holding the narrative hostage.

The second part will be available on Monday. Audio: You can listen to the above podcast here. Archives: Back to the beginning with &quot;Winter Is Coming&quot; (S01E01). Our very civilized discussion of the premiere (S03E01). Fancy-talking about “Dark Wings, Dark Words” (S03E02). Here we are blathering on about “Walk of Punishment” (S03E03). Don’t watch — because you can’t — us discuss “And Now His Watch Has Ended” (S03E04). The rudely interrupted first half of our discussion of “Kissed by Fire” (S03E05). The second half of our discussion of religion in “Kissed by Fire” (S03E05). In which we discuss “The Climb” sans spoilers (S03E06). “The Climb” with spoilers (S03E06). “Second Sons.” We has them (S03E08). Belatedly, “The Bear and the Maiden Fair” (S03E07). You’re all invited to an epic performance of “The Rains of Castamere” (S03E09). This is the end … the end of Season Three (S03E10).</span></a></div>
