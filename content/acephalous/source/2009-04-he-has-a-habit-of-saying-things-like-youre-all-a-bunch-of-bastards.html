<p>The pictures reminded me of the famous <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=pFP&um=1&sa=1&q=macarthur+hirohito+photo&btnG=Search+Images" rel="nofollow">MacArthur and Hirohito</a> meeting. Because of the size differential and monarchy involved, not because we&#39;re an occupying power in Great Britain. I&#39;m behind on my Jewish Conspiracy newsletters, though, that may have changed.</p></span>

And before anyone asks, it should be obvious that this is not the only thing I'll be doing in class on Thursday. It's the pump I'm using to prime a more interesting (and necessary) discussion about the rhetorical triangle—which, given how much fun I'm having image-manipulating right now, might just look like this: Because there is ethos and then there is ethos. But enough assorted silliness from me today. I have serious papers about Ok, Big-Tooth, Afraid-of-the-Dark and Earnest Everhard to revise.</span></a></div>
