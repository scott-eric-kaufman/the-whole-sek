<p>Any slightly more than casual reader of literary journals knows either repertoire, and probably yawns at them both—as much as he is also bored by any eclecticist who tries to use all the factional vocabularies to make a transcendental synthesis.&nbsp; But, in the manner of an impressionistic historian, one can say there <em>are</em> things about what goes on in contemporary criticism today that are typical, even representative of the mode...</p>

<center><strong>From &quot;Fugitive Essays&quot; to <em>Aletheia</em> in Three Simple Steps</strong></center>

<p>If these anthologies serve any real function—aside from being convenient ways for the reader to get hold of fugitive essays—it is to let one think that they make up a consensus for today's critic, an immediate background he presumes to be accurate, from which he launches his own work, to which he responds, against which he defines himself, his allies, or his opponents.&nbsp; In accepting such a background the critic also presumes a background for the background, and without being too dodgy, he would say that these anthologies and what they represent aim to be different from previous anthologies and consensuses, which in turn were different from previous ones...</p>

<center><strong>&quot;Challenges&quot; of the Lesser Critic</strong></center>

<p>Most great critics are methodical; this perhaps only means that they are able to articulate and rationalize their intuitive awareness of literature.&nbsp; But it also means that they are not afraid of making their methods and their own writing independently interesting and intellectually consistent, over and above a work.&nbsp; For the lesser critic such challenges are rare.&nbsp; He will use the work in order to make it work, which it always will.&nbsp; His method will demonstrate its effectiveness, which it will always possess.&nbsp; And on and on, without any sense of the drama underlying method, or of its fundamental ground in intellectual life...</p>

<center><strong>The Will-to-Eccentricity</strong></center>

<p>Some of these dimensions appear perforce eccentric, even determinedly so.&nbsp; But this will-to-eccentricity, I think, is a major project of contemporary critical discourse...</p></blockquote>

	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/02/but_lacan_he_sa.html"><span><strong>But Lacan, He Said Names Were Meaningful</strong> I've always wished my surname was a verb.* I'll sit there at my desk, chin cupped in palm, wishing my mother had possessed sense enough to marry &quot;Gary Conquers,&quot; &quot;Harry Rules&quot; or, I don't know, &quot;Steve Fornicates.&quot; (Better than &quot;Steve Jobs.&quot; No one wants a curious green surname, no matter how it sleeps.) My passion for verbal surnames was inflamed a few years ago, when I taught a student named &quot;Elizabeth Spies.&quot; (You doubt me?) In the age of Google, she is practically invisible, buried beneath the combined noise of her name and its various permutations. As if the Queen of the same name and her elaborate network of spies (I'm looking at you, Franky) weren't enough to foil casual efforts to locate Elizabeth, Google's insistence that someone searching for &quot;Elizabeth Spies&quot; may be interested in &quot;Elizabeth's pies&quot; and its permutations seals the deal. Not that I'm looking for Elizabeth, mind you, or that I want a less visible web presence. I only mention all this because I've spent the day trying to figure out what Edward said. In this database, Edward said quite a bit. In that one, many Edwards have said many things, but none of them are my Edward, so none of them said what I'd remembered my Edward said. Frustrating in the extreme, I tell you. So perhaps not having a verbal surname is a good thing. I could've ended up in the imperative mood, forced to live my life under the strangest of directives: &quot;Stanley, fish!&quot; &quot;Susan, sontag!&quot; &quot;Wolfgang, iser!&quot; *The desire to change my name may be genetic. Upon immigrating to America, my grandmother and great-aunt changed their last name to &quot;Starr.&quot; Hollywood, you know.</span></a></div>
