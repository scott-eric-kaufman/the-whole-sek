<p>The question &quot;What would these workshoppers name their blogs?&quot; circled through my head as I explained the origins of Acephalous to Mark.&nbsp; Would they unintentionally infringe on <a href="http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/">Adam Kotsko</a>'s trademarked dry wit?&nbsp; &nbsp;Would they unwittingly imitate <a href="http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/">John Holbo and Belle Waring</a>'s dead-pan mastery of the obvious?&nbsp; Would they venture down the respectable trails blazed by <a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/~amsp/blog.html">Amardeep Singh</a> and <a href="http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php">Michael Berube</a>?&nbsp; Or would they engage in gentle self-mockery like <a href="http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/">Miriam Burstein</a> or vicious self-deprecation like <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/">Yours Truly</a>?</p>

progress to work on it, and adaptation depends on what Lamarck called <em>sentiment
intérieur</em>,
the ability to adapt, reflexively if not consciously, to environmental
vagaries. In a revision of his last
major work, <em>The Principles of Ethics </em>(1897),
Spencer nuanced Lamarck’s statements on the subkingdom Mollusca. Lamarck, it will be remembered, considers the
entire subkingdom to belong to the <em>animaux
sensibles</em> or “sensitive animals.”</p>

<p>[snip]

</p>

<p>[Spencer] divides Mollusca into
the “cephalopods,” the higher mollusks, and what Lamarck had called “acephala,”
the “head-less” or lower mollusks. I
have chosen to focus on the subkingdom Mollusca because the division between its
orders is so stark: some have heads and are non-adaptive, others have heads and
are adaptive. To be a headless mollusk
is to remain beholden to the whims of the force of progress. For Lamarck, Chambers, and Spencer, the
headless mollusks will acquire heads at a moment preordained by force of
progress. To be a headed mollusk, on the
other hand, is to possess the ability to form habits, and as I discussed above,
the formation of habits is the first link in the causal chain of Lamarckian
evolution—altered environment to changed habits to modified forms. But the headed-headless distinction indicates
why his adamant belief in a progressive, evolutionary, and absolute force would
be tempered by the adaptive prong of Lamarckian evolution: heads mattered. So did what was in them.</p></blockquote><p>So you see, dear reader, I am 1) without head and 2) dependent on a non-existant force of progress if I'm ever to improve my station.&nbsp; Since I place no more faith in non-existent progressive forces than the non-existent divinities compelling them, I'm doubly doomed to this acephalic life.&nbsp; Luckily I've come to like it.</p>

<p>[Tomorrow will witness the conclusion of two long-awaited (if not anticipated) posts: one on <em>Literary Interest </em>and another on <em>The Literary Wittgenstein</em>.&nbsp; Excite will ensue!]</p>

<p>So I guess ignore this contribution if you already know it, but the British anthropologist Meyer Fortes used the term &quot;acephalous&quot; to describe Talensis and other West African societies: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acephalous_Society" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acephalous_Society</a></p>

<p>Might be important, given your interest in social-biological intersections.</p></span>

Since its continuation sounds as indulgent as I thought it would, I've left it there in the comment section. But if you really want to you can read it.] In eleven days Acephalous will have been around for six months. Happy Birthday Acephalous! What can I say? You began as a necessary distraction during a year in which I accomplished almost nothing. That angered me, and that anger confused me because it had been years since anything had pinched the nipples of my soul. I hadn't sweat the small stuff since high school and couldn't be bothered to nearly a decade later. So what did I do with my anger? I started you! I wanted to channel all these useless afflictions into something productive. I had tired of the typical existential wallowing that follows any brush with mortality and I hadn't written a damn thing in months. I would prepare for class and teach and return home exhausted. Then you came around. I haven't been the same since. When you were first conceived you were nothing but an outlet for the unabated anger of a recent cancer survivor. You've since become so much more. You invented yourself an author by the name of &quot;A. Cephalous&quot; who posted hither and thither. &quot;A. Cephalous&quot; earned himself a reputation and then was subsumed into He Who Is Scott Eric Kaufman. (He became the guy in the middle unworthy of the women to his right, your left. Before you ask, he also became the guy whose mother is more Irish than Irish and the guy whose beard grows in bright Irish-Red despite his otherwise stereotypically Semetic features. He also knows how silly this genetic essentialism is. But his beard's still bright red if allowed &quot;philosopher-length.&quot;) This post began with a point. It was to be a retrospective of the evolution of the way in which Acephalous has mattered to me, but it will have to settle for knowing that without it my cancerous anger at universal injustice may've vented itself in far less productive directions. I could say that one of the reasons I groped for The Valve-preservers was because at that moment anger and argument were all I had. That and Wilco. But Jeff Tweedy could only inspire me. He could do nothing for the doldrums that had parked themselves on my jet stream. So I waited-out the weather but the weather did out-wait me. And here I am. Six months later. No longer &quot;A. Cephalous&quot; but myself. No longer chock-full of cancer but filled to the brim with healthy cells. And now you have pictures. Happy birthday Acephalous who is not &quot;A. Cephalous.&quot; Thank you for the survival. (Tomorrow night we'll resume the serious arguments about Zizek, Knapp and Theory. Tonight we eat cake.)</span></a></div>
