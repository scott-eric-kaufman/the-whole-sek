			<p>Every department houses one person who doesn't understand the purpose of the departmental listserv.&nbsp; What is, for the majority of its recipients, a simple means of alerting interested parties to talks, job offers, and other relevant departmental business is, for this person, a public confessional.&nbsp; If an email opens:</p><blockquote><p>LGBT Event at Cross-Cultural Center</p></blockquote><p>This person's outraged response will look like this:</p><blockquote><p>LGBT<strong>Q</strong> Event at Cross-Cultural Center</p></blockquote><p>Or perhaps like this:</p><blockquote><p><strong>G</strong>LBT<strong>Q?</strong> Event at Cross-Cultural Center</p></blockquote><p>Point being, this person will find fault with whatever the first email said because the entire department must be constantly reminded that his or her devotion to justice entails questioning of any potentially privileging statement.&nbsp; If the &quot;G&quot; follows the &quot;L,&quot; the author replicates—and in replicating legitimizes or, even worse, <em>appears </em>to legitimize—divisive structures of representation within the queer community (as broadly as the word can be defined).&nbsp; </p>

<p>Such grievous offense requires a brave crusader to parse every last permutation and then decide, in the end, that since every possible combination privileges <em>something</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>the only thing to do is consider the sending of any email ever a pregnant &quot;teaching moment&quot; and append something like the 5,000 words he or she has just written to every one of them ... for great justice.</p>

<p>Should someone respond to this email with a sarcastic recommendation that the letters be stacked, so as to avoid the any possibility of untoward LTR directional privilege, this person will write <em>another </em>5,000 words, this time about how unfunny the resulting mess would be:</p>

</p></center>


<p>Only it is not merely unfunny—nothing is ever &quot;merely&quot; anything for this person—it is also symptomatic of the desire by hegemons to obliterate the unique identities of the various groups represented by each letter by transforming their hard-won bonds into an amorphous blob of non-identity, thereby effacing the personal struggles of people, like this person, some of which he or she will now share with the entire department no matter how inappropriate discussing the loss of your virginity on a departmental listserv might seem.</p>



<p>Positive responses to this cathartic effusion will be deemed patronizing; negative, evidence of insensitivity born of privilege; silence, a vile attempt to shame this person back into closet in which the queer-uncomfortable majority clearly believes he or she belongs.&nbsp; Any attempts to pull this person aside—via email, in the break room, it matters not—and convince him or her that no offense was offered or intended will result in <em>yet another </em>5,000 word missive about the <em>conspiracy </em>to silence him or her.&nbsp; Were someone to pipe in with a reminder of listserv decorum, complete with a lengthy quotation of its charter, the conspiracy becomes <em>institutional </em>and <em>still another </em>5,000 word letter must be written, this time only CC'd to the listserv as a courtesy when it is sent to the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity.</p>

<p>When this person finally leaves the department, he or she will write a lengthy email reminiscing about how crucial the listserv was to development personal and professional and apologize if exchanges were ever unnecessarily heated.&nbsp; Sooner or later, word will come through grapevine or the <em>Chronicle of Higher Ed</em> that this person has moved up in the world—what was once limited to interdepartmental listservs is now featured on the local news.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And I will laugh at the poor television producers who have no idea what they've gotten themselves into.</p>

<p>Glad I&#39;m not the only one who saw it. It&#39;s <a href="http://guidesmedia.ign.com/guides/9846/images/jigglypuff.gif" rel="nofollow">Jigglypuff</a>, except with a tail.</p>

<p>They should totally use that instead of whatever-letters-are-currently-being-used-(to-reinforce-oppressive-binaries), because it&#39;s adorable. Rather than effacing personal struggles, it raises them up into the expansive lovableness of a <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Jigglypuff_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29" rel="nofollow">balloon pokemon</a>.</p>

You’d think the book-designing avant-garde would be thrilled to work with people unconcerned with sales or money, yet the best cover I’ve seen in ages still falls prey to put-a-giant-fingerprint on-a-book-about-fingerprints logic. That said, it could be worse: Had I access to my old laptop and its surplus of image manipulation software, you’d be treated to covers of novels entitled POISONED! featuring drowned bodies. Or something like this. (Only better.)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/06/knowing-the-res.html"><span><strong>Knowing the rest of the story is half the battle</strong> The reason I'm an historicist instead of an historian—besides the obvious, like being in an English department—is because I'm a bit of a romantic when it comes to my history. For example, to appropriate a line from (of all things) Elizabethtown, I'm a connoisseur of first looks. When, I ask myself, did this figure of future historical significance first enter the national consciousness? Who, for example, is buried in this paragraph from the 30 July 1967 edition of the LA Times? The flames quickly spread to the hangar deck ... setting off bombs, rockets and other ordnance, while touching off many jet planes, all of which were fully loaded with fuel and heavily laden with ordnance. You can almost picture him in one of the &quot;many jet planes,&quot; &quot;bombs, rockets, and other ordnance&quot; exploding around him; but as of 30 July he has no name, no face. For the moment, this anonymous pilot sits alone, as yet undisturbed by history, on the burning pitch of an aircraft carrier in the middle of the Tonkin Gulf. The next day, the New York Times provided a fuller, albeit tentative, account of the fire that took the lives of more than 130 US sailors: For some unknown reason, a plane parked near the carrier's island, midway up the 1,045-foot flight deck, experienced an &quot;extreme wet start.&quot; This malfunction, comparable to what happens when a cigarette lighter is ignited after having been filled too full, occurs about once a week on attack carriers, but almsot never so severely as as it did yesterday. A thick tongue of flame lashed backward from the parked jet, igniting a missile on one of the dozen or so planes parked near the fantail, their engines turning over in readiness for a strike launching scheduled for 11 A.M. The rocket &quot;shot across the deck,&quot; Captain Beling said, &quot;and by a quirk of fate smashed into a fuel tank under a plane on the port side.&quot; No one aboard the Forrestal seemed to know today which plane the missile had hit — but it was probably either the Skyhawk whose cockpit was occupied by Lieut. Comdr. John S. McCain 3d or the one immediately to his right. He is become historical, mentioned by name in the paper of record. Not that this is the first time his name has appeared, as the father and grandfather with whom he shares it appear regularly in Vietnam and WWII reportage; but this is our first glimpse of the man who will lose to Obama in November—alone, almost exploded, surrounded by the agonized screams of the likely dead. What can I say? I'm like Paul Harvey. (Only macabre.)</span></a></div>
