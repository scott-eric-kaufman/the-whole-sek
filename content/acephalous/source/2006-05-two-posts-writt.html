        <meta name="description" content="[Two posts written while Typepad writhed: &quot;Get Your Pretty Tired Act!&quot; and &quot;I Don't Speak Neanderthal, But . . .&quot;] Tonight I want to talk to you about staring at women's breasts. I do it all the time. I'll be standing there talking to a woman only to be stricken by the sudden and irresistible urge to stare at her breasts. She'll register her discomfort by pulling her lapels close or yanking her plunging neckline chin-high. Then she'll become intensely interested in objects in the general vicinity of her feet. But I won't let that deter me. I'll continue to stare at her breasts until she won't be able to take it anymore and informs me in tones of suppressed outrage that she had some important elsewhere to be fifteen minutes ago. Then she'll never talk to me again. Such is the experience of the deaf man in America today. When the eyes of a hearing man break contact and wander south, the obvious conclusion is the correct one: he is staring at her breasts and she is justifiably uncomfortable. When a deaf man who relies on verbal cues and lip-reading to converse lets his eyes drift south of his conversant's, he stops at her lips. (You can tell because if he didn't—that is, if he actually stared at her breasts—he would have no clue how to answer whatever it is she would have said to him while he indulged in some &quot;covert&quot; sexism.) Why mention this in the one forum this commonplace of deaf life will never make anyone uncomfortable? Because I've acquired another rude habit: Talking to people while wearing headphones. People who know me—for example, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Barry Siegel—won't bat an eye when I talk to them with my headphones on because they'll know that I'm reading their lips and not paying attention to the music. They'll know that I'm so invested in the conversation that I've forgotten that I have the headphones on and have merely neglected to remove them. But other people—for example, the inimitable Gay Talese—will look at me horrified as I chat with Barry without removing my headphones. His eyes will rebel against the solipsistic impertinence of youth culture he detects in my actions. I register his discomfort but, blinded by reputation and desperately trying to impress him, I won't understand what it is I've said that so offends him. I'll rifle my brain for the offensive statement the entire walk home and come up empty. Only later that night, as I force myself to stop thinking about the events of the day, will I realize what I've done. And then? So much for sleep." />

		<span id="comment-17042618-content"><p>While I&#39;m sure they can, that doesn&#39;t obviate the point that, since hitting puberty, I&#39;ve had to deal with this on a regular basis.  It may be because women are, rightly, sensitive about men who break eye contact and head south.  I imagine it happens frequently enough, and that after a point, the annoyance is there whether the eyes drift that far south or only to lips.</p>

<p>That said, I can say that I <i>know</i> there&#39;s some problem, since it crops up on a regular basis, especially when I speak to a woman for the first time.  I regularly make new female acquaintances extremely uncomfortable, and after I&#39;ve explained that I was reading their lips, they laugh it off and inform me they thought my eyes <i>had</i> drifted farther south.  In other words, while I&#39;m sure women <i>can</i> discriminate, I&#39;m not sure that in social situations which involve the introduction of a strange male who seemingly refuses to make eye contact, that they do.  And, as I said, with the louse-to-human ratio being what it is, I&#39;m not surprised.</p></span>

<p>Firstly, breasts are not eye-magnets.  The &#39;compulsion&#39; to stare is not unbeatable - I might suggest that it actually stems from a focus on that woman&#39;s fleshy assets as opposed to what she has to say for herself ... and this is something endemic to the male population as opposed to the female.</p>

<p>Secondly, do you really think that your willy is that attention-grabbing?  Jesus.</p></span>

<p>Wait, staring at breasts stems from an interest in breasts? Dude, you&#39;re blowing my mind.</p>

How fortuitous. David Brown's book demonstrates one problem with the field of intellectual history: Intellectual historians often take the thinkers they write about at their word. I know you know the dead horse I wallop here.* For those who don't, a refresher course. The chapter on Social Darwinism and American Thought opens promisingly enough. &quot;The New Deal changed everything,&quot; Brown writes. And it did. The influence of the New Deal and the reaction of those who, like Hofstadter, stood to Roosevelt's left cannot be quashed from any responsible intellectual history of the period. The New Deal shaped the dissertating Hofstadter's politics to a great extent, so much so that the former Communist critic of the New Deal created a mythic philosophical movement with which the New Dealers could pound their opponents. But from that point forward the quality of the chapter declines steeply. Example #1: But Hofstadter produced his thesis under the eye of Merle Curti, a pioneer in the emerging field of intellectual history. Liberated from the Progressive penchant for appointing heroes and villains, Hofstadter was able to merge both his politics and scholarship into a powerful critique of the great titans. (29) What? You want to know how Hofstadter &quot;liberated himself from Progressive penchant for appointing heroes and villains,&quot; don't you? So do I. I've read few books as many times as I've read Social Darwinism and that statement so disconforms from my knowledge of the book that I'm barely able to type the following summary of Hofstadter's &quot;Table of Contents&quot;: &quot;The Coming of Darwinism&quot;: Summary of the period. &quot;The Vogue of Spencer&quot;: Spencer is a big fat villain. &quot;William Graham Sumner: Social Darwinist&quot;: So is Sumner. &quot;Lester Ward: Critic&quot;: My Hero! &quot;Evolution, Ethics, and Society&quot;: Huxley dreamy, Kidd nightmarish. &quot;The Dissenters&quot;: My Heroes! &quot;The Current of Pragmatism&quot;: Williams James and John Dewey! Give me a &quot;P&quot;! Give me an &quot;R&quot;! Give me . . . I could continue, but I think I've made my point. Hofstadter went to great lengths to create heroes and villains in his turn-of-the-century yarn. On some level, even Brown knows this: Hofstadter found a foil to Sumner's philosophy in the impressive scholarship of Lester Ward. (32) How, I wonder, does one have a foil without antipodes? And if Sumner plays foil to &quot;the impressive&quot; Lester Ward, how does that antipodal logic not cast Sumner as the villain and Ward as the hero? I'm baffled. I could continue all night, but I want to save some material for tomorrow. I'm only three pages into the chapter on Social Darwinism, but I should stop now, as I'm tempted to say, pace Ms. Parker, that this book should not be tossed lightly aside but hurled with great force. *Those with access to the OED can witness the fine pun I stumbled into...</span></a></div>

Originally posted on May 4, 2005, &quot;How Not to Open, Close or Anything In-Between an Academic Essay&quot; marked my entry into big-time blogging. No, not the sort of &quot;big-time&quot; that would unleash the hoards of boingboing on my (limited) bandwidth—but a more modest &quot;big-time.&quot; My readership spiked from 25 to about 70 after this post, so I have a spot for it as soft as the one I have for its subject is sore. Note the reference to the fictional &quot;A. Cephalous&quot; which pepper it. Also note the overwrought prose of someone who tries far too hard. Ain't the fact that I don't have to do the former no more grand? Of the latter, the less said the better.] The discussion at The Valve keeps spurring memories of my erstwhile conversion to Church of Theory and Latter Day Feints in the Spring of '98. [Ugh.] The Critical Tradition clutched to my chest, I would speak to anyone willing to listen about &quot;Butler's fascinating essay,&quot; presumably &quot;Imitation and Gender Subordination,&quot; which at the time I felt &quot;the most eye-opening thing I'd read all semester, in that the perspective it offered me [was] so different from what I assumed the 'gay' perspective to be that I [had] a distinct urge to round up everyone I know who's gay and interrogate them.&quot; [Maybe I should've mentioned that those quotations came from the statement of purpose that landed me this swank position at UCI. And this paragraph—did it really need to be this long? No.] [And now it isn't.] Very impolitic, I know, but at the time I only knew two verbs and &quot;intervene&quot; didn't work either. Also, I had spent the previous paragraph &quot;intervening in Irigaray's critique of male-dominated hegemonic practices,&quot; and too much intervention left the young A. Cephalous feeling less effective than a Clintonian Democrat. (His phrase, not mine.) [Don't you love how I complain about tediously overwritten prose in tediously overwritten prose? I'm so ironic. And intentionally, no less.] And so when it came time to write an Honors thesis, I chose the topic closest to my heart: &quot;a Wittgensteinian critique of the discursive function of the feminine and the cyborg in schlemihlhood in Thomas Pynchon's V. and Gravity's Rainbow.&quot; According to my abstract, By utilizing Donna Harraway's all-inclusive conception of cyborg identity I will investigate the realities Pynchon imposes on his characters' bodies without limiting the factual information provided about those realities to the demands on a system I impose on the text. Instead I will work with the epistemological boundaries present in the text itself, provided by the interaction of the historical details, literary allusions, and philosophical and scientific arguments. This will allow me to explicate the text's complexity without reducing it to a more palatable but less accurate representation of itself. [Why didn't I take the opportunity to...</span></a></div>
