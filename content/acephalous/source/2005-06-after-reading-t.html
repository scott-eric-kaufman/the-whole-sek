In the years since the James Gleick's Chaos, this genre's taken the butterfly-flapping-its-wings-Hurricane-Andrew-hits-Gulf-Coast premise to increasing absurd heights: Hitler decides to wax his mustache one morning, his barber tells him a story about a man named Harry whose two mistresses sought each other out and decided to make Harry pay and BAM!

The vehement (but by no means total or consistent) rejection of romantic individualism by literary scholars and the concomitant appeal of tired, unproven (and often unprovable) Marxist critiques of capitalism have a similar effect: namely, the desire to create a model of human society built not upon concerted action but on the unpredictable results of highly contingent processes.

I was informed, brusquely, that that’s not at all what he meant by “criticism” and recommended, highly, that I hie my way into English 3024 and read myself some “Criticism.” Being the lover of systems all linguistics undergraduates are, I took to “Criticism” with the same vehemence I’d once adopted mud-riding, fungo-drilling and x-bar syntax. But my attraction to Gass never faltered, and for the past week or so I’ve found myself drawn again to Habitations of the Word. In particular, I’ve found myself thinking about “The Soul Inside the Sentence” as an example of an appropriation of Freudian thought that says something psychoanalytic about something other than psychoanalytic theory. “The Soul Inside the Sentence” presents a more attractive application of psychoanalytic theory because Gass grants it limited explanatory power: Freud was certainly frank enough when he wrote at the beginning of his essay on Dostoevsky that “before the problem of the creative artist, analysis must, alas, lay down its arms.&quot; By limiting the utility of psychoanalytic thought--by relegating it to the status of productive metaphor--Gass unburdens himself of the unwieldy psychoanalytic apparatus that demands accounting by virtue of its size and complexity. Gass pounces on Freudian metaphors without having to swallow the system whole, allowing him the freedom to discuss how Freud considers with his “customary unempirical daring the passage of such [unconscious] material into our awareness” (emphasis mine). Or, likewise,&quot;by pulling at the one end offered us, how many silken scarves, like the tail of a kite so far away we cannot see it, can be drawn from the sleeve of this incredible magician?” Those things psychoanalytic thought illuminates it illuminates; those things it doesn’t, it doesn’t. (I take this to be the heart of Luther Blissett’s argument on the aforementioned thread.) If I could find some way to properly format the “exchange between the id and its editors&quot;--in which Gass hilariously progresses from “I want the pleasure of playing with my genitals” to “All right. ‘How do I love thee, let me count the ways...’&quot;--I would. Instead, I’ll move through Gass’ psychoanalytic account of literary production desk-by-desk, beginning with “our hero--Frank--[and his] desire struggling weakly for expression. I WANT MY MOMMY!” First Desk: The Superego and its Wastebasket, the Unconscious. “The desk of the first censor is occupied by Ma, Pa, several Step-Uncles, Foster Parents, God, the Orphanage, and Immanuel Kant. Its nays are categorical.” Frank’s desire for the breast of his mother, seventy-five, is denied by the superego, “that notorious dogmatist,” with a simple “no.” So, “with his id at his elbow, Frank tries again. He has noticed that his hostess, Carol Cozycott, has a...</span></a></div>
