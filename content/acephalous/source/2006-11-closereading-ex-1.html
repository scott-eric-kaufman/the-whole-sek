Or am I getting ahead of myself by assuming that the &quot;pipes and timbrels&quot; which close the first stanza play the melodies opening the second? I think I am. The second stanza reads like a theatrical aside—an excuse to indulge in a little Platonic digression on unheard melodies. Like the sound of a tree falling in the woods with no one around to hear it, these unheard melodies must exist independently of the minds which would otherwise perceive them. Or could the speaker be yoking Platonism to the aesthetic of ignorance? He imagines the sweet sounds produced by the pipers, but he has no idea what they actually sounded like. He assumes their sweetness, but for all he knows, those pipes could produce the brown note. Again, the speaker assembles the aesthetic from a collection of ignorant bits. ...therefore, ye soft pipes, play on; Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd, Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone: The speaker implores the pipers to play on in silence. Only, not exactly silence. One can and should still listen to &quot;spiritual ditties of no tone.&quot; What does that mean? According to the OED, in Keats' time the word &quot;ditty&quot; referred to &quot;the words of a song, as distinguished from the music or tune.&quot; This definition threatens to spiral that fifth line into utter oxymoron. The ancient world being short Sambora's talk box, the idea of piping words through pipes to spirits fails the laugh test—but it does engage the reader in a brutal ekphrastic exercise about how the depictions of sounds on the urn relate to the words used to describe them.

Moreover, the speaker suggests the pipers pipe their impossible ditty sans &quot;tone.&quot; What he means by &quot;tone&quot; here is complicated by the &quot;ditties&quot; which lack it, but be the it musical or linguistic, the word still refers to the uniqueness of the phrasing. Why would the speaker want a tone which lacks distinctness? I'm not sure, and to be frank, this entire section of the stanza staggers me like sharp blows to the head, so I'm tabling this discussion for now. I'll return to it when it ceases to produce stars.

<blockquote><p>Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Are sweeter...</p></blockquote>

<p>Are these lines baldly ekphrastic, in that the sounds of &quot;pipes and timbrels&quot; can't be depicted, only imagined?&nbsp; Or am I getting ahead of myself by assuming that the &quot;pipes and timbrels&quot; which close the first stanza play the melodies opening the second?&nbsp; I think I am.&nbsp; The second stanza reads like a theatrical aside—an excuse to indulge in a little Platonic digression on unheard melodies.&nbsp; Like the sound of a tree falling in the woods with no one around to hear it, these unheard melodies must exist independently of the minds which would otherwise perceive them.&nbsp; Or could the speaker be yoking Platonism to the aesthetic of ignorance?&nbsp; He <em>imagines</em> the sweet sounds produced by the pipers, but he has no idea what they actually sounded like.&nbsp; He <em>assumes</em> their sweetness, but for all he knows, those pipes could produce <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_note">the brown note</a>.&nbsp; Again, the speaker assembles the aesthetic from a collection of ignorant bits.</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ...therefore, ye soft pipes, play on; 	
<br />Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd, 	
&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:</p></blockquote>

<p>The speaker implores the pipers to play on <em>in silence</em>.&nbsp; Only, not exactly silence.&nbsp; One can and should still listen to &quot;spiritual ditties of no tone.&quot;&nbsp; What does that mean?&nbsp; According to the <a href="http://www.oed.com"><em>OED</em></a>, in Keats' time the word &quot;ditty&quot; referred to &quot;the words of a song, as distinguished from the music or tune.&quot;&nbsp; This definition threatens to spiral that fifth line into utter oxymoron.&nbsp; The ancient world being short <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_box#Regular_users">Sambora's talk box</a>, the idea of piping <em>words</em> through pipes to spirits fails the laugh test—but it does engage the reader in a brutal ekphrastic exercise about how the depictions of sounds on the urn relate to the words used to describe them.&nbsp; Instead of moving through two distinct media—difficult enough—the speaker compels us to navigate <em>three</em>.&nbsp; Moreover, the speaker suggests the pipers pipe their impossible ditty <em>sans</em> &quot;tone.&quot;</p>

<p>What he means by &quot;tone&quot; here is complicated by the &quot;ditties&quot; which lack it, but be the it musical or linguistic, the word still refers to the <em>uniqueness</em> of the phrasing.&nbsp; Why would the speaker want a tone which lacks distinctness?&nbsp; I'm not sure, and to be frank, this entire section of the stanza staggers me like sharp blows to the head, so I'm tabling this discussion for now.&nbsp; I'll return to it when it ceases to produce stars.</p>

<p>With line fifteen, the speaker offers a repreive from dizzying ekphrasis:</p>

<blockquote><p>Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave
&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Thy song...</p></blockquote>

<p>Stop.&nbsp; What is being described here?&nbsp; A fair youth beneath <em>multiple</em> trees?&nbsp; Is he one of the first stanza's &quot;men or gods&quot; in &quot;mad pursuit&quot; or &quot;struggling to escape&quot; with &quot;pipes and timbrels&quot;?&nbsp; Are we still looking at the same frieze, or have we moved onto a different one?&nbsp; If we're still looking at the same one, shouldn't it matter whether the &quot;fair youth&quot; is a man or a god?&nbsp; Because if he is the latter, what would the passage of time matter?&nbsp; He wouldn't require the immortality his visage on the urn procures because he already possesses it.&nbsp; Again, the speaker transforms his ignorance into an aesthetic—only this time, he does so through the very invocation of the thing that his ignorance creates: immortality.</p>

<p>I need to think more about that relation than I can this evening.&nbsp; After a <em>long</em> day of dissertating, I find digging through complex works and the critical effusion they inspire altogether taxing.&nbsp; Exhilerating, too.&nbsp; Posting <em>about</em> ignorance from a position <em>of</em> ignorance strains my sad faculties to the breaking.&nbsp; Plus, the deeper into the evening I think, the greater the chance of vicious insomnia.&nbsp; No more poetry for me tonight, love.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You seem to be getting a bit overly tied up here.  Even if you read this as literally as literalness can possibly be literal, then anyone under a forest canopy is beneath multiple trees.  But what is wrong with the general idea of Keats / the poet looking at the drawings on the urn?  You know: first he&#39;s looking at pipers, and even those pipers can&#39;t actually pipe (being merely drawings within the glaze) he&#39;s saying that his imagination of their piping is better than real piping would be (having heard real pipes, I believe him); the next drawing is of a fair youth in a forest, the next of etc.  The second through fourth stanzas appear to be the poet looking at the drawings on the urn in turn, which would have different pictures drawn on different sides of it in typical Greek style.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-24903051-content"><blockquote>But what is wrong with the general idea of Keats / the poet looking at the drawings on the urn?</blockquote>

<p>The problem is that by the second stanza I don&#39;t trust the narrator.  If he can&#39;t answer any of the questions closing the first, why should I believe that he can recognize the figures in the second?  Do we actually have a &quot;fair youth&quot; and &quot;bold lover,&quot; or do we have a god in a man costume trying to rape a goddess and/or mortal woman?  (I&#39;ll try to stick with germane examples.) </p>

<blockquote>The second through fourth stanzas appear to be the poet looking at the drawings on the urn in turn, which would have different pictures drawn on different sides of it in typical Greek style.</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s certainly the poem&#39;s conceit, but I&#39;m not sure we ought to buy into it.  A visual aid is in order.  What&#39;s happening in <a href="http://www.cassdesign.com/images/panel31.jpg" rel="nofollow">this painting</a>?</p>

<p>One answer is obviously &quot;quite a bit,&quot; and I <i>could</i> describe what I think&#39;s going on, but I don&#39;t actually know what&#39;s represented there.  The best I could hope for is an accurate description of the players involved—putting aside, for the moment, the fact that facets of their identity like &quot;immortality&quot; are hidden from me—but there&#39;s no guarantee that what I&#39;d say would be at all accurate.  Imagine, for example, you asked an educated Chinese poet from the 10th Century to describe <a href="http://fits.depauw.edu/aharris/Courses/ArtH132/galleries/images/fullsize/fs_Caravaggio_Entombment.jpg" rel="nofollow">this painting</a>.</p>

<p>The answer would be &quot;people carrying a man, mourning over him possibly, &amp;c.&quot;  This hypothetical Chinese poet would <i>not</i> understand the actual significance of the piece.  The best he could hope to do would be to describe the human pathos it entails.  <i>Maybe</i> from clues immanent to the painting he could describe some general social hierarchical relations—you know, like from the various modes of dress, their positioning in the painting, &amp;c.  But the point would be that, in the end, the possibility to interpret the painting horribly, horribly wrong is high.</p>

<p>More later, though, as well as responses to Nynhav and Porlock.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-24903773-content"><p>&quot;This hypothetical Chinese poet would not understand the actual significance of the piece.&quot;  OK -- but is there really an &quot;actual significance of the piece&quot;?  Isn&#39;t that sort of like the One True Interpretation of a poem?  Can&#39;t you sort of mumble &quot;reading is misreading&quot;, phone something in, and get drunk?</p>

<p>Less humorously, of course you&#39;re more likely to produce a horrible misreading if you know nothing about the culture that produced the artwork.  (As a historicist, I&#39;d imagine that this is not just pragmatically evident for you but also an article of faith.)  But that argues against your apparent thesis from your first post:</p>

<p>&quot;[...] I think the poem is less about the timeless value of aesthetic objects and more about how things only become aesthetic objects once they&#39;ve lost whatever they once meant.  In other words, aesthetic objects are not created without regard to the historical moment in which they&#39;re produced, but become aesthetic objects only after the particulars of that moment have been lost to history.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s difficult to say both that aesthetic objects only become aesthetic after the particulars of their moment have been lost to history *and* that horrible misreadings of an object are more likely once you really lose track of the culture that produced it.  Unless aesthetic objects are made aesthetic by horrible misreadings, then it sounds like you&#39;re suggesting a kind of Golden Mean of cultural distance; particulars lost, generalities not yet lost.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-24906999-content"><p>Scott,</p>

<p>It seems like you&#39;re putting together a wonderful reading -- I have no idea whether you intend to continue posting it to Acephalous, but I hope so. Engaging, original readings of poems like the &quot;Ode&quot; seem to me to be what academic blogging is all about. </p>

<p>It&#39;s helpful that you looked up the original meaning of &quot;ditty.&quot; Keats is writing about the translation of the immediate and the sensuous (here represented by the &quot;tone&quot; of music) into the more abstract and &quot;spiritual&quot; language of &quot;no tone,&quot; in a manner reminiscent of Hegel&#39;s aesthetics of progress towards abstraction. Plato is certainly a point of reference, since Keats identifies truth with perfection of form, and also with those transhistorical elements that can be isolated from the historical particulars of the work (as you write, Keats&#39;s unanswerable questions prove the specific history has been lost). </p>

<p>At the same time, the reduction of content to universal content is not a reduction to nothing. There is passion here, and music, and religious sacrifice, and ecstasy and fear -- the fact that we, cut off from the urn by our own historicity, supply our own &quot;music&quot; to the soundless scene, does not make it identical with any other object. What is beautiful about the urn is that the <i>forms</i> it represents (such as the amorous chase) are true for the Greeks, for Keats, and for his generations of readers. Thus you could say that the object becomes aesthetic at the moment that we can appropriate it subjectively without distorting it. (No distortion is possible, because no historical certainty is possible.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-24908369-content"><p>Rich is onto something with the &#39;horrible misreading&#39; angle, I think.  It may be worth keeping in mind the locus classicus of ekphrasis (a word which means, of course, &#39;stepping away from&#39; or &#39;stepping out of&#39;, <i>not</i> &#39;a bit of a poem describing the visual arts&#39;), the core text being <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/iliad.18.xviii.html" rel="nofollow">towards the end of this bit of the <i>Iliad</i></a>.  One thing that any reader of the Shield of Achilles can&#39;t help but be struck by (as Keats must have been struck, reading in Chapman&#39;s translation) is the way the static bas-relief of the shield (a) contains far more detail than any shield actually ever could, (b) contains scenes <i>in motion</i> and with sound, not because Homer was anticipating TV but because once he has stepped out of or away from the main thrust of his epic narrative he continues in a narrative mode.  Sometihng similar orients Keats&#39; approach too, I think; or rather, precisely an awareness of the horrible (yet inspiring) impossibilities of p.o.v. that inform Homer&#39;s original</p></span>

<p>Looking back over this, I noticed that your germane example above is actually pretty germane to my point as well.  One of the words that you didn&#39;t OED was &quot;unravish&#39;d&quot;.  I&#39;m not sure whether either the Greeks who made the urn and/or Keats really distinguished between the consummation of a marriage, a tryst with a lover, and the act of rape in the same way that we do -- or, rather, I&#39;m sure that they did distinguish between them, but they might have used the verb &quot;ravished&quot; for all, the most important point being whether the woman was virginal or not.  That was the point of some of my casually feminist reading; Keats may not know what the Greeks really meant by their urn, but he&#39;s written part of a narrative of objectification that people thought was in part adopted from Greek ideas.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-24921853-content"><p>[<i>I&#39;m breaking these replies into individual comments, as they&#39;re becoming quite long.</i>]</p>

<p>Rich:</p>

<blockquote>It&#39;s difficult to say both that aesthetic objects only become aesthetic after the particulars of their moment have been lost to history <i>and</i> that horrible misreadings of an object are more likely once you really lose track of the culture that produced it.</blockquote>

<p>Actually, the confusion there is because I&#39;m playing with ideas as I move along.  I can&#39;t use the strong form of both arguments, but the weak can easily coexist.  Replace &quot;only&quot; with &quot;likely&quot; and the argument still works.  Or you can define &quot;aesthetic object&quot; as one pregnant with possible misreadings and argue that such objects are—pardon my nonsense—<i>more</i> pregnant after details of the culture that produced it are lost.</p>

<blockquote>The Greeks who produced the urn presumably thought of it as an aesthetic object, unless you intend &quot;aesthetic object&quot; in a speical term-of-art way that I don&#39;t think is really diffentiated enough from its common usage when discussing a decorative urn.</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not.  Same definition—however, I also take it as an article of faith that they didn&#39;t consider it an aesthetic object the same way we do.  As you mentioned earlier, it could have had a daily, ceremonial or funereal function which we&#39;re simply ignorant about.  I suppose that would make it less an <i>aesthetic</i> and more an <i>aestheticized</i> object, <i>i.e.</i> a car with sharp lines, but still a car.  If thousands of years from now—after teleporters have become ubiquitous—people were to describe the aesthetic qualities of a Porsche 911 and claim that its bucket seats were symbolic of a culture which valued individual meditation in enclosed spaces.  </p>

<blockquote>One of the words that you didn&#39;t OED was &quot;unravish&#39;d&quot;.</blockquote>

<p>You misunderestimate me, Rich.  I looked up <i>all</i> the words in the <i>OED</i>.  I only cited the significant ones.  Point of fact, there is no <i>OED</i> reference to &quot;unravished,&quot; just pointers to &quot;un-&quot; and &quot;ravished&quot; and three quotations:</p>

<blockquote><b>1628 FELTHAM</b> <i>Resolves</i> II. xxxvii. 114 Had not Dinah had so good a one [sc. face], she had come home vnrauished. <b>1717 POPE</b> <i>Iliad</i> IX. 480 My beauteous captives thither I&#39;ll convey, And all the rest of my unravish&#39;d prey. <b>1820 KEATS</b> <i>Ode Grecian Urn</i> i, Thou still unravish&#39;d bride of quietness!</blockquote>

<p>When words lack definition and one of the only citations is the one you&#39;re looking for, the <i>OED</i> tends to be unhelpful.  But there are a couple things to note here: first, that the <i>OED</i> botched the line, or at least presented with an unfamiliar and exhortatory exclamation point.  Instead of the slow excresion of names culminating in &quot;Sylvan historian,&quot; the <i>OED</i> would have us believe Keats intended a series of explosive namings—while minor, the difference could be importance, although attributing too much to typography can get you in trouble, as my wife the paleographer is quick to remind me.  That said, the earliest American print I can find—and by &quot;print&quot; I mean &quot;newspaper&quot; or &quot;magazine,&quot; as I don&#39;t have time for a trip to special collections—has the exclamation point as well.  (That&#39;s from <i>The Rover: A Weekly Magazine of Tales, Poetry and Engravings, Also Sketches</i>, 14 June 1845, p. 198.)  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll come back to ravished in a moment, but I wanted to note how inappropriate, or at least ironic, a terminal exclamation point is right there.  Why <i>yell</i> praise of an object valued for its quietness?  </p>

<p>Back to unravishing, though: I think you&#39;re right about the ambiguity any use of the word entails.  Moreover, it also had a heavy <i>spiritual</i> element, so throw that in the pot too.  What&#39;s more interesting—esp. in light of Adam&#39;s comment—is that one of the only other uses of &quot;unravished&quot; comes from the <i>Iliad</i>.  Granted, I know Keats&#39; &quot;On First Looking into Chapman&#39;s Homer&quot; predilects us to thinking of the Elizabethan translation as primary, but it is unreasonable to think he wasn&#39;t also familiar with Pope&#39;s?  I honestly don&#39;t know—I&#39;m on the wrong shores at the wrong time.  Irrespective of its origin, what strikes me as interesting about the word is its implicit threat.  For something to be &quot;unravished&quot; does not mean it is <i>unspoiled</i> but that it&#39;s yet to be <i>despoiled</i>.  Destiny via neologism, like a woman who sits in a train station &quot;still unraped.&quot;<br />

<blockquote>...precisely an awareness of the horrible (yet inspiring) impossibilities of p.o.v. that inform Homer&#39;s original.</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that, but I&#39;m not sure how that relates to the idea of misreading.  The difference between the shield of Achilles—or, more generally, between ekphrasis in epics like the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Aeneid</i> and Keats&#39; &quot;Ode&quot;—is the amount of contextual information provided by the surrounding work.  Achilles&#39; or Aeneas&#39; shield, Dido&#39;s murals, &amp;c. are nestled in an explanatory framework, providing the reader with the information necessary to produce a decent reading.  (<i>Someone outside my window just blew the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_of_Gondor" rel="nofollow">Horn of Gondor</a>.  Now children cry loudly and my head splits.  Fuck you, Boromir.

Keats appeals to the ekphrastic tradition, but he doesn&#39;t participate in it so much as allude to it via those appeals.  I think that&#39;s where the poem breaks down for me, and why I&#39;m having problems wrapping my head around its representational logic.  </p></span>

<p>This is true for the ekphrases in the <i>Aeneid</i>, I agree, where eg Aeneas&#39; shield carries famous scenes from (to him) future Roman history.  But it&#39;s really not like that in the <i>Iliad</i>: check it out, it&#39;s a glorious mess of all sorts of details tossed out without any attempt to link them into the larger narrative.  I mean, there <i>are</i> two cities described on the shield that are kind of at war (which may remind us of the topic of the epic in which the shield is placed) but there&#39;s also lots of other stuff; harvest, dancing, a murder, panel of justices, blood-money to be paid, the land, the ocean, all jumbled up in a way that make it <strike>really hard</strike> impossible to imagine how all this stuff could be arranged on a circular shield.  It&#39;s quite like Keats, actually: we expect a description of an urn, or a shield, to give us the information necessary to mentally piece together what the urn, or shield, looks like: but Keats, following Homer, doesn&#39;t gives us that.  That&#39;s what I meant: it&#39;s a kind of deliberate, creative stepping away from the responsibilities that might be thought to inhere in the ut pictura poesis tradition.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure anybody has done a reading of the Ode that gives full weight to the &#39;stepping away from&#39;-ness implicit in it being an ekphrasis: the empty town, the struggles to escape, the stepping away to sacrifice and so on; leading up to that gloriously evasive (sidestepping) equivalence of beauty and truth. One day, maybe.</p>

<p><i>...but it is unreasonable to think he wasn&#39;t also familiar with Pope&#39;s? I honestly don&#39;t know</i></p>

<p>EVERYBODY knew Pope&#39;s Homer in the first half of the C19th; every poet at any rate.  Keats certainly did.  There are various references to it in his letters (I don&#39;t have an edition to hand), and a famous couplet in which Keats sneers that Pope sat upon a rocking horse and thought it pegasus.  Check <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=Keats+%22Pope%27s+Homer%22" rel="nofollow">out</a> what even a quick goog shows up.  But though he slagged off Pope, he owed a huge amount to him (as did, incidentally, Byron, who repeatedly said that Pope was the giant who towered over all of post-Miltonic English poetry, Byron&#39;s contemporaries included).  That Popish &#39;unravished&#39; in his <i>Iliad</i> is very interesting.</p></span>

<blockquote>Engaging, original readings of poems like the &quot;Ode&quot; seem to me to be what academic blogging is all about.</blockquote>

<p>Engaging?  Maybe.  Original?  No.  I think you and I had the conversation about genius vs. diligence—if not, well, I had it with <i>somebody</i>—but I belong with the diligent folk.  According to my notes, I&#39;ve read 73 essays on the &quot;Ode&quot; since I recognized its importance on October 21st.  (I say &quot;read,&quot; but what I mean is &quot;I have notes on,&quot; which isn&#39;t exactly the same thing.)  My point is that I&#39;m cobbling my reading together, much like I always do.  I&#39;m not, as <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/08/continuing_with.html" rel="nofollow">I attempted a few months back</a>, doing a close-reading of the poem.  So I doubt I&#39;m breaking new ground <i>here</i> exactly; but in the connections I&#39;ll draw between Keats and Mitchell in my chapter, I think I am.  History will tell. </p>

<p>That said, I find it amusing—and likely the subject of a post with GIANT FLASHING SIGN to ward off prospective plagiarists—that Google&#39;s already ranked this conversation into the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hs=LQp&hl=en&lr=lang_en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&q=%22ode+on+a+grecian+urn%22&btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">the first twenty results</a> queried.  So this kind of conversation may, in addition to being what academic blogging&#39;s all about, also what cements our place in the plagiarism history.  </p>

<blockquote>Keats is writing about the translation of the immediate and the sensuous (here represented by the &quot;tone&quot; of music) into the more abstract and &quot;spiritual&quot; language of &quot;no tone,&quot; in a manner reminiscent of Hegel&#39;s aesthetics of progress towards abstraction.</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m surprised you mention Hegel in this respect.  (<i>HA!</i>)  (<i>For the rest of the class: Joe&#39;s at a Hegel conference right now.</i>)  Seriously though, I thought about mentioning Hegel in <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/closereading_ex.html#comment-24921834" rel="nofollow">my earlier response to Porlock</a>, but didn’t because, well, I&#39;m not sure Keats works with the Hegelian move to abstraction so much as ... some other one?  By which I mean, my Inner Historicist got the best of me.  That said, I think the speaker favors a general process of abstraction, since that&#39;s what affords him the appreciation he can glean despite his ignorance.  Only if he abstracts and aestheticizes the relations depicted on the urn can he turn them in his mind—but I&#39;m not even sure if the abstraction precedes the aestheticization or vice versa.  Does the one enable the other?  Would a Roman who saw the urn kiln-fresh have even considered it an aesthetic object?  I return to this because it points to the question suggested by your next sentence:</p>

<blockquote>Plato is certainly a point of reference, since Keats identifies truth with perfection of form, and also with those transhistorical elements that can be isolated from the historical particulars of the work</blockquote>

<p>What is the perfection of form?  I understand the work it does in this sentence, but doesn&#39;t it point to the very classical ideals which, had they been viewed with the eyes of a very classical person, been a matter of <i>craftsmanship</i> instead art?  Some of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008GK98/diesekoschmar-20" rel="nofollow">lovely machines</a> have smooth lines and gentle balance, but a hundred years from now I hope no one considers them <i>art</i>.  Five thousand years from now they may be of <i>archeological</i> import, but I don&#39;t want to confuse the priority of form and function, which is why I used Halloween-themed napkins as an example earlier.  Granted, confused priorities may be <i>exactly</i> what Keats thematizes here—but that suggests an attitude toward the speaker that I haven&#39;t seen assumed in Keats criticism.  (It may well be, but 73 essays is barely a grain of sand on the beach of Keats Industrial.)</p>

<p>So I would need to know more then about the urn&#39;s form—or maybe not, maybe the urn&#39;s form as suggested by the poem is enough to warrant its place among the art objects of Keats&#39; England.  But then the poem becomes entirely about the <i>response</i> to objects, plural, and not to this particular (albeit composite) urn.  That is, it concerns an attitude toward the world, one which transforms the mundane into objects of high art <i>regardless of what they are</i>.  A father could be chasing his &quot;whore of a daughter&quot; after catching her <i>in flagrante</i>, but the speaker &quot;sees&quot; an amorous chase.  I know I&#39;m harping on an unknowable actual here, but only because I want to resist the urge to flatten the speaker&#39;s interpretation of the events depicted on the urn into the representations themselves.  Even if the urn&#39;s actual can&#39;t be fathomed, that doesn&#39;t mean the speaker&#39;s interpretation isn&#39;t a distortion. As I&#39;ll write today, I think there&#39;s evidence in the poem that we&#39;re supposed to distance ourselves from the speaker&#39;s interpretations.  But on that, more shortly.</p></span>

<blockquote>EVERYBODY knew Pope&#39;s Homer in the first half of the C19th; every poet at any rate.</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what I thought.  I&#39;ve just learned to be careful—esp. about books in the age before mechanical reproduction—about assuming that just because one big name <i>now</i> did something, his contemporaries would&#39;ve known or even been acquainted with it.  (<i>Moby Dick</i>, anyone?)</p>

<blockquote>This is true for the ekphrases in the Aeneid, I agree, where eg Aeneas&#39; shield carries famous scenes from (to him) future Roman history.

<p>My mistake here: I didn&#39;t mean that the context for placing representations on the object being described here, but the larger, cultural contexts that would help make sense of the scenes represented.  The <i>Iliad</i> itself contains enough information about Greek culture as to render some of those meaningful in a way that, had we only the description of the shield provided in Book 18, we wouldn&#39;t—and that Keats, via the speaker&#39;s ignorance, places the reader in the position of only having the description of the shield in Book 18.  Does that make sense?</p>

<blockquote>It&#39;s quite like Keats, actually: we expect a description of an urn, or a shield, to give us the information necessary to mentally piece together what the urn, or shield, looks like: but Keats, following Homer, doesn&#39;t gives us that.</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know—I <i>distinctly</i> remember having to memorize the content of Achilles&#39; shield and be able to reconstruct the shield itself on the final exam.  Which is neither here nor there, I know, since we now have the same knowledge required to reconstruct the shield that we have about the urn.  But that knowledge isn&#39;t immanent in the Keats the way it is in the <i>Iliad</i>, I don&#39;t think.  Moreover, since Keats thematizes his speaker&#39;s ignorance, I can only guess he deliberately wanted to exclude it.  (I could be wrong here, though.  He may have thought it common cultural capital and chunked it for brevity.)</p>

<blockquote>I&#39;m not sure anybody has done a reading of the Ode that gives full weight to the &#39;stepping away from&#39;-ness implicit in it being an ekphrasis: the empty town, the struggles to escape, the stepping away to sacrifice and so on; leading up to that gloriously evasive (sidestepping) equivalence of beauty and truth.

<p>Heh.

Or is it only when a picture of it is taken that the picture becomes &quot;art&quot;?  Sorry for this callow venture into the picked-over world of Duchamp readymades, but the thread seems to demand it.  (I wasn&#39;t trying to make such a point with the &quot;art exhibition&quot; really; I just liked the pictures.

I could have written a poem ostensibly locating this association within the intent of the wheel, as if the shape of the object *intended* to tell me this story.  Is that what you mean?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-24938308-content"><p>Scott,</p>

<p>By perfection of form, I&#39;m referring to all the ways in which the urn is beautiful: it&#39;s beautiful because the trees and figures painted on it are beautiful, and it&#39;s beautiful taken as a whole. Keats takes Plato&#39;s idea that what is unchanging in the world must be its truth, and adds that we find what is unchanging, beautiful.</p>

<p>I definitely would not connect the painting on the urn with the &quot;artistic&quot; qualities of modern, minimalist objects; but that doesn&#39;t mean that minimalism and functionalism aren&#39;t art. </p>

<p>The reason Hegel seems specifically relevant is that he privileged philosophy (i.e. the written word) over other kinds of creative production, such as sculpture, because language is not apprehended through the senses. I&#39;m actually not at the conference yet -- I was painfully aware of the overlap between my comment and my current area of focus -- but darn if it <i>still</i> didn&#39;t seem to apply. </p>

<p>Also, is the need for a responsible historicism met by the overlap between Keats&#39;s lifetime, and Hegel&#39;s? Hegel would have been giving his lectures on aesthetics in the decade following the composition, in 1820, of Keats&#39;s ode.</p></span>

<p>That being said, I believe that there are epigrams in the Greek Anthology that are closer to Keats than Virgil or Homer - ekphrasis without context.  Also Catullus 64 for an ekphrasis in an epyllion where the relationship between the ekphrasis and the surrounding narrative is rather hard to establish.  (Arguably also Moschus&#39; Europa.) So it may not be all that different from the ekphrastic tradition.</p>

<p>  The closest relationship would be with Theocritus&#39; bowl in Idyll 1?</p>

Fifty-five years later, the contradictory babbling of the critical brook has grown into a rushing roar of deafening rapids whose brutal churnings hoist screaming scholars from their tiny boats and into the water, under the water, out of the water, rumbling them here then tumbling them there and pushing them forward, forward, forward, so when they gain, for good, the surface, breathe a breath, or two, and find, their bearings, they have just enough time to see the end they share with the cascade as it launches them over the falls—ascending, soaring, falling, plummeting—and they slam with fury on the surface of the lake below, where their battered bodies drift here, then there, until they join, join the others, on the shore, another academic casualty, half-drowned, half-broken, bloating in the hot sun. Such is the fate of those fools dull enough to venture into criticism of what W.J.T. Mitchell calls &quot;the ritual example&quot; of ekphrastic poetry. Interpret &quot;ritual&quot; as a hazing cruel hazing gratuitously cruel hazing and you'll begin to understand the pleasures attendant upon entering the Murray Kreiger Memorial &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; Wing of the critical canon. Unfortunately, I need to produce a specific, sophisticated reading of the poem in order to finish my Silas Weir Mitchell chapter: specific, because it must conform to Mitchell's notions about art and history; sophisticated, because contemporary literary scholars must be more sophisticated than the dim brutes they study. I can handle the former—I'm likely the only person alive who can—but I could use some help with the latter. Otherwise I'll spit nonsense about how some ekphrastic moments are &quot;considerably less stable than [those] maintained by a model ekphrastic text such as 'Ode on a Grecian Urn,' [in which] Keats' speaker has direct access to the urn.&quot; (No, I will not provide a citation, thank you very much.) Anyhow, on to the interpretation: Most critics agree that the urn is a composite, equal parts Elgin Marble, Townley Vase, Portland Vase, one of Josiah Wedgwood’s jasperware duplicates of the Portland Vase, &amp;c. It's only indirectly ekphrastic, because it does not describe a particular object so much as create in readers' minds the object it describes. So Keats' infamous ignorance, which I will discuss shortly, must be feigned—one cannot not know what's represented on a nonexistent vase. Keep that in mind as I weave—sometimes deftly, sometimes like a drunken sailor—through Keats' poem, the first line of which reads: Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness The speaker addresses the urn here, so we can't say for certain whether he's describing the poem or...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/closereading_ex_2.html"><span><strong>Close-Reading Exercise: A Good Bad Reading of Keats' &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn,&quot; Part III</strong> [This would be the third installment of my insanely close reading of Keats &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn.&quot; You can find the first here, the second here. I know some of you must be bored by now, but I must say I feel like a scientist who—having written the definitive treatise on the leaf—was handed a microscope and then—having written the definitive treatise on the cell—was handed an electron microscope, &amp;c. The more attention I pay the more the poem yields. I will, however, interleave other posts in with the Keats come tomorrow. For now, to the show again!] I open with a few more lines than before: Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu; And, happy melodist, unwearièd, For ever piping songs for ever new; More happy love! more happy, happy love! Why? Happy you should ask! I cannot tell you how happy I am at this happy coincidence! It is a most happy, happy coincidence! Wait—what do you mean? I am not trying to hard. Does it sound like I'm trying to hard? Does not. Does not! Does not! You may have a point. This stanza screams of argumentum ad nauseam. You want something to mean what you think it should, you repeat yourself until no one cares to challenge you or—not to be topical or anything—until people begin to mumble your words under their breath as they stumble into pool halls and voting booths. In this example, the speaker needs you to believe the boughs are happy, happy with their perpetual plumage. Maybe they are. Maybe pain follows every leaf plucked by wind or wanton hand, and so the thought of keeping its foliage lushed and unplucked in perpetuity appeals to the bough. That, at least, is what the speaker assumes. Of course, since he anthropomorphizes the tree, I should have license to. Perhaps Spring is the deciduous equivalent of our awkward, teenage years. Perhaps every tree dreads the arrival of Spring, what with the budding pains, the pericarpal outbreaks—not to mention the inevitable heart rot. Why should we assume that trees are happy in Spring? The Western Tradition? Is the one Keats and his speaker shared the same as the one the Roman potter and his clientele did? Not necessarily. In diction, Keats and his speaker betray an aware of this. The boughs &quot;cannot shed&quot; their leaves. Not &quot;will not shed&quot; but cannot.&quot; Despite its overwhelmingly happy happiness, the tree has been prevented from acting, prevented from doing what it would do left to its own devices. Coupled with the coercive repetition, this characterization of an anthropomorphized tree seems cruel and unnecessary. Had the tree just been a tree, I wouldn't bother—but anthropomorphize it and its inclusion in the scene becomes disturbing. I suppose the attribution of agency hangs me up here, but with repeated readings that first line begins to resemble the words of a serial killer to his victim: &quot;Tell me how happy you are. Tell...</span></a></div>
