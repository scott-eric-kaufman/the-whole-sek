				<p>The <em>Say Anything </em>soundtrack—like its taste-making compatriot <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F6305283516"><em>Singles</em></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important; -moz-binding: url(chrome://global/content/bindings/general.xml#asdfzxcv);" width="1" />—took
pains to prove that despite being married to a founding member of
Heart, Cameron had chops: Peter Gabriel, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The
Replacements, Fishbone, Depeche Mode, Living Colour &amp;c.&#0160; Now <em>that </em>was a soundtrack . . . typical of a time and a place and an attitude I sheepishly emulated.&#0160; Same logic applpies <em>Elizabethtown.&#0160; </em>Right down to the Elton John song &quot;My Father&#39;s Gun.&quot;</p>

<p>Lyrically the song is typical early &#39;70s <a href="http://www.eltonography.com/albums/tumbleweed_connection0.html">Taupin-penned bombast</a> [.<a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/myfathersgun.mp3">mp3</a>]</p><blockquote><p>From this day on I own my father&#39;s gun
<br />We dug his shallow grave beneath the sun
<br />I laid his broken body down below the southern land
<br />It wouldn&#39;t do to bury him where any Yankee stands

</p>

<p>I&#39;ll take my horse and I&#39;ll ride the northern plain
<br />To wear the colour of the greys and join the fight again
<br />I&#39;ll not rest until I know the cause is fought and won
<br />From this day on until I die I&#39;ll wear my father&#39;s gun

</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
<br />To New Orleans well that&#39;s just fine alright
<br />&#39;Cause there&#39;s fighting there and the company needs men
<br />So slip us a rope and sail on round the bend

</p>

<p>As soon as this is over we&#39;ll go home
<br />To plant the seeds of justice in our bones
<br />To watch the children growing and see the women sewing
<br />There&#39;ll be laughter when the bells of freedom ring</p></blockquote><p>When
I initially listened to the lyrics I thought them slyly brilliant. 
Taupin&#39;s narrator longs to head south and fight in one of the few major
engagements unknowingly fought <em>after </em>the peace treaty ending its war had been signed.&#0160; You know: &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_New_Orleans">The Battle of New Orleans</a>.&quot;&#0160; So we have the British-to-the-bone <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=external-search%3Fsearch-type=ss%26index=music%26keyword=Elton%20John">Reginald Kenneth Dwight</a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important; -moz-binding: url(chrome://global/content/bindings/general.xml#asdfzxcv);" width="1" />
inhabiting the voice of an American who wants to fight in a war already
over because he hears &quot;the Company needs men.&quot;&#0160; The Americans lost 13
and had 58 wounded; the British lost approximately 700 and had 2000
wounded.&#0160; What would the Americans have done had Taupin not sent
intrepid Elton to the rescue?&#0160; Would <em>fourteen </em>have fallen?&#0160; Perish the thought!<br /> </p>

<p>Then I realized the talk of &quot;southern land&quot; and its partner-in-rhyme &quot;where any Yankee stands&quot; probably place this song in the <em>Civil </em>instead of 1812 War.&#0160; But that only makes the song stranger.&#0160; <em>Now</em> Sir Elton is an orphaned Southern Boy who wants to parrot the slave&#39;s death sentence by traveling down the Mississippi on a <em>riverboat</em> to a city blockaded the Union Navy?&#0160; And the reason this anti-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilberforce">Wilberforce</a> wants to join the fight?&#0160; To ensure that children will grow (Can&#39;t have them <em>not </em>now
can we?) and women will sew (What else are they good for besides
producing stunted children?) and that there&#39;ll be laughter when the
bells of freedom ring . . . in the infamous New Orleans slave markets
wherein wealthy white landowners will again be free to trade in human
chattel.&#0160; While laughing.&#0160; To murglarize one of <a href="http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/r/rabelais/francois/r11g/part122.html">my favorite passages in all of literature</a> as thoroughly as they did American history:</p>

<p>By what
metagrobalistic circumbilvaginations can Taupin and John justify this emblustricated
gibble-gabble gibberish of odious error and heresy? </p>

		<span id="comment-16182202-content"><p>You know, your above sentence of &#39;despite being married to a founding member of Heart&#39;, got me thinking.</p>

<p>I think &#39;Almost Famous&#39; singlehandedly gave me a sudden appreciation for two whole decades of music. I had formerly really quite despised 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s music that languered in the &#39;Classic Rock&#39; genre. I grew up a child of the 80&#39;s and really heavily got into punk aka emo punk in the 90&#39;s which was all about &#39;politics and integrity&#39;. So I think I just disliked what I saw as manly posing and slick non-truthfullness in the music, clothing, and mood of the 70&#39;s decade. Then in one fell swoop, in one movie and soundtrack, I learned to appreciate Led Zepellin and the like. Why? Empathy. That movie and soundtrack made the 70&#39;s Classic rock accessable to me, a younge lesbian, because I was finally able to understand where they were coming from, what theye were growing up in, and what the time was like (as much as film can convey that kind of meaning.)<br />
Heart is now one of my favorite bands.<br />
Whodathunk it.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/a_night_alas_of.html"><span><strong>The First Day of Class &amp; Last Day of &quot;Vacation&quot;</strong> I pre-season this post with an unnecessary—given the new sidebar item top-right—admission that &quot;My Morning&quot; didn't win a Koufax Award. To be frank: I like the image of the probable kvitcherer I created better than any shot of the smooth Koufaxian delivery of Evelyn Lichtenstein's menscheleh. (On purpose, people, on purpose. C'mon! I ain't that lapsed. What? You! In the peanut gallery. Yeah you. That's right. I did hear. Now shut it! Don't make me take off this belt.) I open by acknowledging that this quarter will be the last I ever teach literary journalism. I won't be hired to teach it . . . and UC requires I stop teaching after I teach, um, as many quarters as I've taught at UCI. This saddens me. I'd like to keep teaching this course indefinitely. Jonathan once accused all teachers of deluding themselves into thinking they're both well-liked and tough graders. He's surely correct. Only not so much in my case. In the past three weeks I've learned that four of my former students will be attending the prestigious Columbia School of Journalism. Another two will enter the equally elite Northwestern School of Journalism. I know what you're saying: &quot;Scott, if you've been teaching literary journalism so long that you're placing your kids in graduate programs, it's time to move on.&quot; And it is. But that doesn't mean I have to be happy about it. On a different note entirely, I'd hoped the &quot;Best Introduction To&quot; post would've gone viral already. Alas! It seems to affect only Americanists, Medievalists and Theory buffs. I solicited some links for it yesterday and that seems to be doing the trick. (Check out this conversation for instance.) I think there's something to what Craig and Matt and Laura argue in the comments; but I also think there's something to be said for an introductory text which allows someone with little more than interest to acquire something resembling knowledge. I would love someone to pick up the baton and run with it. In particular, I'm still sorely lacking in all things pre-Revolutionary American but not Medieval. This includes all things Analytic and Philosophical . . . some Existential stuff . . . and a whole slew of traditions based on the outlandish idea that it's acceptable to write in languages other than English. As if.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/best_introducti.html"><span><strong>Best Introduction To . . . Part II</strong> Because the sight of the unbroken &quot;Best Introduction To&quot; list inspires vertigo, I've decided to chop it up into smaller disciplinary units and repost an updated version of it. I also want to request that if you think this project worthy, please post a link to this post and a brief explanation of my rationale on your site. (I want to thank John, Richard, Sharon, Lance, Ralph and the New Kid for doing so already.) Or if you're an academic and your departmental listserv isn't too particular about the nature of the emails shot across it, maybe drop your colleagues a line and see if they have any suggestions. Because at this point I've probably exhausted the patience and expertise of my regular 500 readers. I want to reiterate my desire to expand the number and types of categories I have here. For example, I have a numerous medieval categories, but they're almost exclusively English. What's the best book out there on the Provençal troubadours or Andalucían Spain? What about Asia? Or the Indian subcontinent? What about genre? Now for a quick rearticulation of the project: Within every discipline and sub-discipline there is a Book X which most professors recommends to students seeking an intelligent introduction to Subject Y. These are not necessarily books designed to be introductions—The Oxford Companion to Metagrobolism or Introductory Essays on Scandanavian Goregrind and Circumadjacent Genres: A Festschrift in Honor of Bjarni Herjólfsson III—but books recognized by those of requisite expertise as the most comprehensive peek at a particular field. Yes &quot;comprehensive peek&quot; is oxymoronic. That's the point. These books allow any student or autodidact who wishes to acquire functional working knowledge of a field and they come credentialed by scholars in a non-blurby fashion. A beginner who scans book jackets quickly learns that every book &quot;is not merely a genealogy and a critical reassessment of the legacy of everything, but a provocation to our sense of our history and our selves and God and the definitive explanation on why every snowflake is unique and special.&quot; If this beginner thumbs through a scholarly bibliography instead, she may as well be preparing for qualifying exams for all the good that obsessive scholarly comprehensiveness will do her. Too little information and she'll miss the point; too much and she'll be overwhelmed. A solid introductory text of the sort faculty members already assign on a regular basis seems to me a happy medium. So without further ado, I present the new and improved &quot;Best Introduction To&quot; list: __________________________________________ Classics &amp; Church Fathers: Homeric: The Best of the Achaeans, Gregory Nagy Presocratic: Aristotelian: Platonic: Images of Excellence , Christopher Janaway Horatian: Augustinian: Patristic: Medieval England: Anglo-Saxon: Early Medieval: Twelfth Century Renaissance: The Envy of Angels: Cathedral Schools and Social Ideals in Medieval Europe, 950-1200 , C. Stephen Jaeger Medieval: The Cambridge History of Medieval English Literature , David Wallace, ed. Late Medieval: Hochon's Arrow , Paul Strohm Early Modern England: Early Modern: English Renaissance: Renaissance Self-Fashioning : From More...</span></a></div>
