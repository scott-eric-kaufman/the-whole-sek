Jackson&#39;s taking advantage of our implicit understanding of filmic convention when he zooms in on Sauron&#39;s hand: he knows that such zooms are sometimes intended to convey <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/01/follow-that-thought.html" target="_self">a thought process-in-process</a>, so by sustaining the zoom it appears as if the ring itself is thinking. The edit from the extreme close-up of the ring to Frodo&#39;s face and back to an even more extreme close-up on the ring breaks up the continuity of the zoom, meaning the ring doesn&#39;t appear to be thinking so much as <em>conversing</em> with Frodo. It&#39;s asking Frodo to put it on, and from one shot to the next is becoming more insistence, hence the increasing extremity of the zoom. That&#39;s a literalization of the typically figurative allure of a token of power. Who falls victim to this allure? </p>
<p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;victim.&quot; In one sense, the victims are a few <strong>singularly important people</strong> through whom the narrative will be focalized; in another, it&#39;s the <strong>anonymous hordes</strong> whose fates will be decided by which of those singularly important people acquire the token of power. For example, here&#39;s a singularly important person surrounded by his anonymous horde:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c71d8bf970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Lord of the rings - fellowship of the ring00029" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c71d8bf970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c71d8bf970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Lord of the rings - fellowship of the ring00029" /></a><br />You can tell Elrond&#39;s important both because of the central framing and the difference in costume: it&#39;s not just that he&#39;s not wearing a helmet, but that not wearing a helmet makes his full face available to the audience. (See <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/09/game-of-thrones-winter-is-coming-for-will-and-bran.html" target="_self">here</a> for a preview of why that&#39;s important.) It goes without saying that in terms of genre it&#39;s the singularly important people who undertake quests and the anonymous hordes that go to war. It&#39;s also worth noting the color of Elrond and his anonymous hordes, which for historical reasons typically fight against anonymous hordes that look like this:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee3e7388e970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Lord of the rings - fellowship of the ring00019" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee3e7388e970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee3e7388e970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Lord of the rings - fellowship of the ring00019" /></a><br />I&#39;m not saying that dark skin and unconventional jewelry decisions necessarily indicate that a character in a high fantasy will be less-than-noble, but neither am I denying it. (There&#39;s a reason that conversations <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/12/king_kong_the_s.html" target="_self">like this one</a> happen, and about Peter Jackson, no less.) But more on that later, because at this point it would behoove us to unify the generic conventions I&#39;ve identified as succinctly as possible: <em></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>High fantasy consists of narratives in which singularly important people go on quests for tokens of power in order to facilitate or forestall wars between anonymous hordes and all of that can be tracked on maps. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems like a fair assessment of the genre, as established in <em>Fellowship</em>, don&#39;t you think? If you don&#39;t, what essential features do you think I&#39;ve missed? </p>

<p>Distinguishing &quot;High&quot; fantasy as a genre separate from fantasy seems like you&#39;re running the risk of a tautological/no-true-scotsman thing. Wouldn&#39;t it be easier to say something like &quot;Magical Realistic Worlds with Homeric narratives&quot;? Or would that just not be useful to your students?</p></span>

It seems to me that that description would possibly include a lot of stuff that we might not really consider High Fantasy, since you&#39;ve removed entirely any dependance on a &quot;world utterly unrelated to the one in which we live&quot;.</p>

<p>For instance, suppose I wrote an epic spy novel following a rookie spy during the Cold War that follows his/her global search for a Secret Document that will help win/end/delay an imminent war between the faceless hordes of the American/Soviet armies. Is that high fantasy?</p>

<p>Aside from the &quot;in order to facilitate or forestall wars&quot; piece, your definition seems remarkably close to a sort of Joseph Campbell-type hero&#39;s journey thingy. (Can you tell I&#39;m not a &quot;literature guy&quot;? Go easy on me...) And I always thought the point of that was that it was quasi-universal, across lots of genres.</p></span>

For instance, with the exception of the &quot;token of power&quot; part of your definition, it also perfectly applies to the Western.  And all parts of your definition encompass a lot of science fiction.</p>

<p>I think any definition of high fantasy should include the nostalgia for pre-modern social hierarchy that runs through the genre.  It should also include magic - the key feature that generally distinguishes fantasy from its more technology-minded cousin, science fiction (with the exception of hybrids like Star Wars, which is basically Tolkein plus space ships).</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c324a2a22970b-content"><p>I&#39;m casting back to a &#39;Narrative Fiction&#39; course I took as an undergrad, the title of which was basically an excuse for a well-tenured Shakespearean to teach Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Charles Williams and George MacDonald. He established a working framework of the genre we were reading at the outset as well: </p>

<p>The main thing his definition had that differs from yours is a specific sense of the &#39;fantastic&#39; (or &#39;phantastes&#39; in the MacDonald sense of the word) as a thing that is of and arises from nature, yet somehow surpasses nature. It&#39;s not so much &#39;supernatural&#39; as <i>supra</i>natural or <i>extra</i>natural. This is basically a broader conceptual framework for what you get in the land of faerie: For the likes of the Inklings and pre-Inklings like Edmund Spenser, John Milton and even Shakespeare -- and arguably this could work for Martin as well -- the specific sense of the fantastic emerges out of the faerie world, which itself is intrinsic, rooted in the rocks, trees, winds, waters and loam of nature. That&#39;s also what sets itself apart from, say, science fiction; the fantastical elements of science fiction are generally constructed by the population of that world or are tapped out of nature, while the fantastical elements of the kind of fiction in question here is more elemental, existing there long before the world was ever populated (hence the Silmarillion). It often does but doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be a throwback to arcane historical social context; Neil Gaiman&#39;s made a career of dealing with fantastical elements in our own contemporary context. </p>

<p>But constituent of that &#39;rootedness&#39; is what prior narrative traditions (mythic, oral) identified as &#39;fantastic&#39; and &#39;extranatural,&#39; and that&#39;s where you get your exotic creatures, especially in northern Europe. Dwarves came from inside mountains; trolls from rocks; giants from out of mountains, etc., and if you really start to dig down into them, you find they&#39;re broadly metaphoric of different states of the experience of nature. Trolls don&#39;t live under rainbows. Check out the connection between the Giant&#39;s Causeway in Northern Ireland and Fingol&#39;s Cave in Scotland. (Interestingly, there are many similar creatures in Native American folktales, at least among the Anishinaabe-speaking tribes.) The Green Man of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is a great example of this, as are Cane&#39;s Clan and the dragon from Beowulf. Its why Christian proselytizers/St. Patrick had to go around blessing and claiming wells in the name of the church; the wells already represented elemental conduits to the faerie world, which Christianity needed to eclipse in order to become established. Yet this rootedness of the fantastic world remains: John Millington Synge went to the west of Ireland to collect old Irish folklore before Gaelic disappeared. At one point while interviewing an old woman, he asked her if she really believed in the faerie folk; she replied she didn&#39;t, but that didn&#39;t mean they weren&#39;t there. And to this day, in Ireland and (IIRC) Iceland, public works like roads will re-route if a faerie-ring pops up in their path.  </p>

<p>Martin&#39;s is a decidedly less exotically fantastic world than Tolkien&#39;s, but not because he&#39;s trying to make it more recognizable; as is pointed out over and over again, when there were dragons in the world, those other fantastical elements emerged, like the ability to produce wildfire. Dragons are certainly linked to the Targaryens (Dany is immune to fire), and they may also be connected somehow to the Others; as the dragons become stronger -- and hence elemental magic becomes increasingly possible -- the Others north of the wall rise up and begin marching south. Whoever controls the iron throne as a token of power (for a long time the magical Targaryens) also controls the fate of millions in direct confrontation with the Others of winter. And don&#39;t forget the weirwoods, Martin&#39;s own imaginative take on the Ents (<i>weir</i> comes from the Anglo-Saxon root for <i>man</i>, as in <i>wergild</i> or man-price, or <i>werewolf</i> -- man-wolf).</p>

<p>So in short, high fantasy quest narratives have singularly important people going after tokens of power in order to facilitate or forestall wars between anonymous hordes in a world whose nature is comprised of fantastical, extranatural elemental features, all of which can be tracked on maps. If you don&#39;t have the elemental, faerie-like fantastical components -- even if they&#39;re not used -- then you&#39;re not really dealing with fantasy.  </p>

<p>[I&#39;m already off on a tangent, and almost went off on a tangent-within-a-tangent, a Chinese box of tangents, about myths, literary syncretism, and how the whole concept of &#39;fantasy&#39; relates to the process of god-like creation through mimesis, but this is long-winded enough.]</p>

<p>(P.S. The National Weather Service is naming the next hurricane &#39;Gandalf,&#39; so you have that going for you.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c324b16b8970b-content"><p>It strikes me as unnecessarily perverse to reject the key characteristic of &quot;high fantasy&quot;, which is that it takes place largely or entirely in a completely different world, one which is moreover explicitly unrealistic (in the sense of containing magic and the supernatural). The problem is that your initial formulation &quot;Works of fantasy exist in a world utterly unrelated to the one in which we live and are therefore purely escapist&quot; conflates two entirely separate concepts, and is arguably just as illogical as saying, &quot;Romantic comedies take place in the real world and are therefore purely escapist.&quot;  I&#39;m happy to agree with the idea of rejecting the automatic assumptions of escapism when it comes to works of fantasy, but you kind of have to keep the &quot;invented world&quot; bit, otherwise, as JME correctly points out, what you&#39;re left with is the much broader category of epic adventure.</p>

<p>After all, <i>Mission Impossible IV</i> fulfills all of your final criteria -- do you really want to say that <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i> and <i>Game of Thrones</i> are in exactly the same genre at <i>MI IV</i>?</p>

<p>(As a minor point, &quot;wars between anonymous hordes&quot; is kind of redundant -- anything on the scale of an actual war is going to involve &quot;hordes&quot;, most of whom will remain anonymous.)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll disagree slightly with Stephen on the issue of &quot;romances&quot; and point out that what <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i> and <i>Game of Thrones</i> -- and JME&#39;s &quot;epic spy story&quot;, <i>MI IV</i>, etc. -- share is that they are, well, <i>epic</i> in scale and scope: the fate of nations -- possibly the whole world -- is at stake, and the story usually spans entire continents (either because individual characters travel across large parts of the world, or because we get different sub-stories taking place in widely separated places). So while Westerns can certainly be seen as romances, they are not epics in the sense of Tolkien&#39;s and Martin&#39;s stories.</p></span>

<p>Yes, it does, although I think it actually does so somewhat more in the mode of the two fantasy movies than is the case with the Indiana Jones map scenes. Which is to say: in addition to the visual evocation of an older filmmaking style, the Indiana Jones map scenes are primarily used to convey the sense of long-distance travel while it&#39;s happening (e.g., as a short-hand for &quot;somehow, the characters get from Nepal to Egypt, but we&#39;re not going to waste time with shots of people boarding airplanes and conversations about which airport they&#39;re landing in now&quot;) more than for purposes of orientation. It doesn&#39;t actually matter where Nepal is in relation to Egypt, just that they&#39;re rather far apart.</p>

<p>By contrast, the map scenes in <i>Fellowship</i> and <i>Game of Thrones</i> are crucial for two things: establishing right from the start that we&#39;re in a completely different world, and giving some very basic sense of geopolitical orientation (the Shire is over here, Morder is way over there; Winterfell is far to the north of King&#39;s Landing, but the Wall is even further north; the Dothraki are across the see on a whole different continent; etc.). The latter is important not just because characters travel long distances, but because of the international politics which are an important part of the story in both cases.</p>

<p>I think the map sequence which opens <i>Casablanca</i> is largely scene-setting, because a 1940s American audience wouldn&#39;t be expected to know where Casablanca <i>was</i>; it also establishes a minimal geopolitical context: Casablanca is across the sea from Nazi-occupied Europe, but not far enough away. And, now that I think about it, the sequence also creates an ironic contrast between the motion of people travelling <i>to</i> Casablanca (&quot;From Paris, to Marseille, across the sea to Oran, then by train or car or on foot across the rim of Africa to Casablanca&quot;) and the fact that they&#39;re now unable to go anywhere else. (<i>Casablanca</i> isn&#39;t a story about people travelling to other places, it&#39;s a story about people who, having travelled from other places, are now stuck and prevented from going any further.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee3f8366c970d-content"><p>In war and in war stories, people can get stuck. People also can be moving and on the run. Genres can mix and mesh. Let me cite another recent popular source: Battlestar Galactica (TNS), ostensibly science fiction, but following for the most part the conventions of a war story, and all full of magic to boot. A simulacrum of a (presumably dead) character appears inside another character’s head. When he defies her one too many times, the character who appears more-or-less immaterially to him assumes corporeal form to put him back in line. The only magical beings I know of who almost always are invisible, but who can appear to whom they choose, and can assume corporeal form when need be, are djinn. Also, very pertinent to the way the story plays out, djinn follow the same religions as human beings. Djinn are mischievous, but no more malicious than we. An entire anonymous horde is fleeing, but all of them together, are on a quest, and are brought to their goal via magic provided by a character who has risen from the dead to lead them to the promised land. High fantasy? SciFi? A war story? I think all three.</p>

<p>And speaking of djinn, I don’t think high fantasy necessarily needs a new map. P.B. Kerr’s Children of the Lamp series presents our world with a twist; djinn and similar beings are real, and like djinn as described above can be good, bad, or any shade in between. The major difference between his djinn and the traditional view as described loosely above is that djinn here are corporeal, and invisible when need be. Also it presents nice opportunities for comedy, as for instance when our twin protagonists emerge from an underground quest to find themselves in the middle of a U.S. Army camp in occupied Iraq. The books are billed as YA, but then so is LOTR, really. As for realism on human motives this is much more Martin than Tolkien. The Harry Potter books are another prime example of our world with a twist fantasy. So my view is that high fantasy does not require a completely other world.<br />

But besides complimenting you on your great eye for framing and your phenomenal abilities as a writer and teacher, I keep stumbling over one recurring detail that may be rare instance of inaccurate critical vocabulary. In a number of posts I&#39;ve read, including this one, you consistently use the word &#39;zoom&#39; for a shot in which the camera moves closer to an object in the frame. Since the use of zoom lenses in both classical and post-classical Hollywood cinema is rare (outside of its use as a historically specific visual style, predominantly in the 1970s), the shots you refer to as zooms are in fact as far as I can tell mostly tracking shots, not zooms. I&#39;m sure the distinction is meaningless to most people, but since it&#39;s something I always find myself correcting in my students&#39; work, I felt compelled to comment here as well.</p></span>

You'll recall that according to the first post, Van Patten made Will a sympathetic deserter and oath breaker; according to the second, Van Patten established the family dynamic through Bran's perspective; according to the third, Bran remained the focal point because everyone believed themselves to be acting in his best interest; and according to the fourth and final post in this series, which would be this one, we'll finally witness the &quot;punchline&quot; of the preceding scenes. To begin: The scene shifts from inside Winterfell to somewhere outside it. It's difficult to tell exactly where because there's a notched log occupying the majority of the frame. Why the log? Because Will's world is now the size of its notch. His world closes in on him as his death nears, so it makes sense that his purview, visually speaking, follows suit. It momentarily expands into an extreme long shot when he believes he's found an excuse that might could maybe save him: But only momentarily: Note contrast between these two shots: in the first, the camera is at a distance and captures a large swath of the highlands that are bright despite the mist blanketing them; in the second, the camera tightens in and centers on Will in a medium close-up, and the compositional structure is oppressive: he is flanked on both sides by armed guard and the hill behind doesn't, as the one in previous shot did, suggest freedom so much as unscaleable-rock-that-might-as-well-be-a-wall. He's trapped within the structure of the shot, and the medium close-up reminds us of the fear and pain we saw on his face when he was captured: The irony of being imprisoned on an open field is more apparent in the above because the framing is looser, but it's essentially the same shot as the one in which he confesses his oath-breaking with one important exception: when he confesses to have broken his oath, he knows all hope is lost. In the shot above, the possibility of escape still exists, if not on that field, then possibly through pardon—hence his mentioning the white walkers two frames previous. But by the time he enters that structurally oppressive medium close-up, he knows his fate. As do the other characters in the scene, and more importantly, the extent to which they sympathize with is indicated by the distance of the camera from their faces. This may seem like a simple means of identifying a complex emotional response, but it has a long history in film theory, the short version of it goes something like this: Films used to be silent. Because actors couldn't tell us what they were thinking and many directors found intertitles aesthetically unappealing, the close-up on actors' faces became the preferred means of communicating their emotions. The heightened expressiveness evident in the close-up compelled audiences to pay more attention to the micro-expressions written upon the actors' faces, which made directors...</span></a></div>

This should be a cat informing you that he can see dead people: This should be a cat yowling the opening notes of &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;: When Typepad let me post on Monday it reshuffled the images about an hour after I posted, so that's how long this post will remain up. If all goes well it'll be replaced by one about Fellowship and Game of Thrones later this afternoon. UPDATE: That obviously didn't work. If you're interested in the sausage-making, I'll just say that on the back-end, they're in the right order. They just won't display that way.
