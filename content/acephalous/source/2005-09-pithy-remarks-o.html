Today I hear from my family in Houston that they're evacuating to Baton Rouge to dodge Rita. (But it's about time for another Storm of the Century, now that we're finished dealing with the political, structural and emotional fallout from Katrina.[1]) At least this time all the politicos understand that their careers are on the line, so the people of Galveston (which has seen its fair share of powerful hurricanes before) have already begun evacuating the barrier island off the single road connecting it to the mainland. (When will the calls to permanently abandon Galveston begin? How long before Dennis Hastert pens some inflammatory, inappropriate and insensitive remarks? Galveston, after all, doesn't front the planet's fourth busiest port complex.) At this point I'm almost tempted to say that the entire South should be reconfigured along the lines of &quot;the perpetual train&quot; in China Mieville's Iron Council. Put the whole region on rails. Instead of evacuating the people, whenever the latest Storm of the Century barrels down on some Southern coastline the South can pick up its skirts, lay down its rails and evacuate itself. (Given his impressive breakdown of the failure of the federal, state and local governments to respond to Katrina I wonder why he hasn't beat me to the punch.) Ugh. I thought I was finished with this particular panic attack for the 2005 Hurricane Season. [1] Because the history of New Orleans (according to Wikipedia) is no longer subdivided into &quot;Colonial Era,&quot; &quot;19th Century,&quot; &quot;20th Century&quot; and &quot;Hurricane Katrina.&quot;</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/09/distracted_by_t.html"><span><strong>On the Materiality of Evidence; or, Can I Cite Listserv Etiquette?</strong> For awhile now I've subscribed to the Jack London Listserv. The discussions range from typical fanboy esoterica (&quot;What ever happened to the Snark?&quot;) to scholarly inquiries into London's sexual orientation (&quot;Was Jack a pitcher or a catcher?&quot;). I had never looked at the listserv's official homepage before, but needless to say I was shocked by this guide to student submissions to it: Students doing papers on London are welcome to send questions, however they should be aksed after the research is underway. Do not ask questions like, &quot;How did Jack London's writings express social Darwinism?&quot; or &quot;Where can I find criticisms of The Call of the Wild?&quot; Instead, be precise, such as &quot;I'm including the following stories for a paper on London and Social Darwinism ... Have I left any out?&quot; Or, &quot;X says the following about The Call of the Wild ... Here is my idea. What do others think?&quot; In other words, do your own footwork first. Now those of you familiar with my dissertation know why this amuses me: I'm currently writing a chapter on London in a dissertation devoted to proving illegitimate questions like &quot;How did Jack London's writings express social Darwinism?&quot; One critical component of my argument is that literary scholars, academic historians and the general public have an unshakeable belief that some thing called &quot;social Darwinism&quot; exists and that popular writers (especially naturalists like Jack London) glean their unflappable faith in some form of pernicious environmental determinism from it. Only it doesn't and they don't. I would love to include that excerpt from the listserv's home page in the list of general misconceptions that necessitate a project like mine. Somehow I don't think it meets the evidentiary standard for academic papers. Then it hits me: I would have (and in fact have not had) any problem including similar ephemera from the turn-of-the-century in my dissertation. (The current version of London chapter itself includes a brief discussion of MacMillan's advertising campaign for Before Adam.) But for some reason I believe brittle and dessicated 98 year old newsprint to be more substantial than a webpage on a university server which has been up since (at least) 13 June 1997 and which has contained the text about London and social Darwinism since (at least) 15 August 2000. While I understand that the London site may disappear, the Wayback Machine shouldn't. (The Wayback Machine is a collaborative project with, among others, the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian. While based in San Fransisco, it has mirror sites around the world, so even if the unthinkable should happen to the entire United States, the electronic record of the webpages of its former citizens will be safe ... deep in the heart of the Middle East.) Anyway, why am I reluctant to cite one form of ephemera when I enthusiastically cite another? Why am I such a technophobe? I'm not entirely sure, but this is something I should think about more rigorously sometime after 1) the quarter starts, 2) I...</span></a></div>
