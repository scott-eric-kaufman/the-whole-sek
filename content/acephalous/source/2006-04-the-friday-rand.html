			<p>The &quot;Friday Random Ten&quot; phenomenon so popular among other bloggers never made sense to me.&nbsp; It seemed more a showcase for one's refined and eclectic taste than anything else.&nbsp; But as I read Jill's <a href="http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2006/04/28/friday-random-ten-15/">FRT</a> on <a href="http://www.feministe.us/">Feministe</a> today, the appeal of it struck me.</p>





<p>An FRT is a mixtape.&nbsp; <em>From</em> no one.&nbsp; But <em>to </em>you.&nbsp; The first two entries on Jill's FRT are:</p>

<ol><li>Radiohead - &quot;Life in a Glass House&quot;</li>

<li>Ani DiFranco - &quot;32 Flavors&quot;</li></ol>

<p>As I read that I was immediately confused.&nbsp; The song which popped to mind was Ani DiFranco's &quot;Glass House,&quot; off her compelling <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000058MY/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Little Plastic Castle</em></a>.&nbsp; The structuring metaphor is nearly identical, being that there's little difference between an anthromorphized goldfish and a person living in a glass house.&nbsp; Like all lyricists who are too-clever-by-half, DiFranco hits the mark or embarasses herself.&nbsp; On both &quot;Little Plastic Castle&quot; and &quot;Glass House&quot; she hits the mark.&nbsp; She takes the conceit and plays with it:</p>
		</div>
					<a id="more"></a>
			<div class="entry-more">
				<blockquote><p>They say goldfish, have no memory,<br />I guess their lives are just like mine. <br />And the little, plastic castle,<br />Is a surprise every time.</p></blockquote><p>She refuses to let what could become a burdensome metaphor dominate the song.&nbsp; Same thing in &quot;Glass House&quot;:</p><blockquote><p>Sitting in my glass house,<br />While your ghost is sleeping down the hall.<br />Watching the little birds fly<br />Kamikaze missions into the walls.<br />Think I'm gonna stay in today,<br />Sit on my couch and watch them fall.</p>

<p>[<em>snip</em>]</p>

<p>Trapped in my glass house,<br />Crowd has been gathering since dawn.<br />Make a pot of coffee<br />While catastrophe awaits me out on the lawn.<br />Think I'm going to stay in today,<br />Pretend like I don't know what's going on.</p></blockquote><p>You
wait the entire song for her to throw the first stone, but instead she
insists on remaining passive.&nbsp; She refuses to throw the stone others
are so sure she'll throw they've been gathering since dawn.&nbsp; As in
&quot;Little Plastic Castle,&quot; in which a woman claims amnesia when she
clearly refuses to hold the grudge she's entitled to hold, in this song
DiFranco refuses to throw the stone she's entitled and expected to
throw.&nbsp; (She <em>did </em>once write a song whose devestating consisted of the single sentence &quot;<a href="http://www.danah.org/ani/Dilate/Napoleon.html">Everyone is a fucking Napoleon</a>.&quot;)&nbsp; </p>

<p>The interesting fact about this discussion is that it doesn't have a
damn thing to do with the actual song on Jill's FRT.&nbsp; It's a confused
combination of a Radiohead title and some metaphorical continuity on an
eight year old Ani DiFranco album.&nbsp; I had made a series of interpretive
leaps and now I'll never be able to think of the DiFranco songs quite
the same way.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because they are now inhabited by the paranoia of
the Radiohead.&nbsp; DiFranco's admirable passivity has been infected by the
Thom Yorke's lyric about a friend who wants to paper the windows of her
glass house:</p><blockquote><p>Once again, I’m in trouble with my only friend.<br />
She is papering the window panes.<br />
She is putting on a smile.<br />
Living in a glass house.</p></blockquote><p>The futility of papering the <em>windows </em>of
a glass house has always struck me as central to the song's
creepiness.&nbsp; Papering the windows will provide you with no more privacy
than you had before.&nbsp; The only way to achieve real privacy would be to
paper the walls.&nbsp; Except:</p><blockquote><p>
Well of course I’d like to stay and chew the fat.<br />
Well of course I’d like to sit around and chat.<br />
But someone’s listening in.</p></blockquote><p>Not only do you live in a glass house <em>but</em> <em>someone bugged it.&nbsp; </em>He
doesn't specify whether those puppies are only wired for sound or if
they can pick up video too—but what difference would that make?&nbsp; All of
which is only to say that Yorke's deep paranoia is now intimately
connected to DiFranco's postures of indifference.&nbsp; The power of the
&quot;Friday Random Ten&quot; isn't dissimilar to that of found art.&nbsp; It relies
on the reader's familarity with the materials accidentally cobbled
together, on havinig an audience both familiar with the songs listed
and who have already done a modicum of precognition.&nbsp; </p>

Girlfriend in particular. But his &quot;Devil with the Green Eyes,&quot; off Altered Beast, may be my favorite song. Unfortunately, technical difficulties prevent me from sharing anything. So instead I'll let Holbo share by proxy. Last weekend, he introduced me to an album almost too indulgent to believe. Sweet teamed with Susanna Hoffs—yes, that Susanna Hoffs—on Under the Covers, an album worth its weight in warm fuzzy nostalgia. Hoffs' voice is as evocative now as it was when she hieroglyphed 'cross the screen twice daily on Nick Rocks! I know you're dying for a couple of samples. Too bad! You'll have to live with three of the worst songs on the album. Please, do not purchase the album and hear the rest of the songs, all of which are better than those three. (Although, good or no, the nostalgia's almost overwhelming enough to render those satisfying. They aren't. You crave the rest.) [Edit: No more gifts! I've overshot my bandwidth allotment and . . . suspect TypePad may be unhappy about that.] [What follows is a version of my initial response to the Spivak event. It seemed inappropriate earlier. I lacked the time to edit my complaints constructively last week, and still do. But I post them nonetheless, if only to deflate some preposterous claims forwarded elsewhere. I hide it all below the fold since it likely bores the lot of you. That said, it contains many pretty pictures, which we can discuss in isolation from the silly words which surround them. This will, however, be my final word on the matter.] Caravaggio, &quot;Doubting Thomas&quot; Mark Tansey, &quot;Doubting Thomas&quot; As I read Spivak's &quot;Scattered Speculation,&quot; I thought it strange that this text was forwarded as a counter-example. How could it not be considered highly eclectic? In tone and diction; in the allusive style of its argument; in its constant quotations from the traditional roster thinkers associated with what I'd call Theory, I could hardly think of a more illustrative example of the form. I was baffled. So I devised some scenarios. What some thought would happen: As everyone surrounded the figure they believed Jesus reanimate, I required solid evidence. I would have to pluck the wound. Once done, the other apostles would be proven correct. Our faith would become fact. Spivak would not be an example of Higher Eclecticism once I engaged her work seriously. What actually happened: As I stood in the middle road, I could not believe that ground had opened beneath our wheels. I had been a passenger, brought to this fissure by another, and she seemed unconcerned. Unbelieving. She stared at me, hand on shifter, oblivious to the altered rock face behind her. She would never believe what had happened. She would insist that Spivak was not an example of Higher Eclecticism despite abundant geological evidence to the contrary. In truth, she would floor the accelerator and wax triumphant when she reached her destination. &quot;Could you imagine such idiocy?&quot;...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/04/friday_random_t.html"><span><strong>Friday Random Ten</strong> After thinking about &quot;Friday Random Ten&quot; as an aesthetic phenomenon, it seems silly not to slap one up there myself. I'm normally no fan of the routine blog post—as evidenced by the couple I've concocted that've fallen by the wayside—but that has more to do with the &quot;length&quot; of my attention span. A few iterations and I'm bored with it. This window into my iRiver's soul will slam shut sooner than later: Clem Snide - &quot;Action&quot; The Pogues - &quot;If I Should Fall From Grace With God&quot; Dave Van Ronk &amp; Frankie Armstrong - &quot;The Legend of the Dead Soldier&quot; Sleater-Kinney - &quot;I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone&quot; The Jayhawks - &quot;Wichita&quot; Django Reinhardt - &quot;H.C.Q. Strut&quot; Wilco - &quot;Box Full of Letters&quot; Blonde Redhead - &quot;Without Feathers&quot; Drive By Truckers - &quot;Lookout Mountain&quot; Grant Lee Buffalo - &quot;Lonestar Song&quot; What have I learned? To believe in Random. At least one-third of my iRiver consists of Jeff Tweedy-related albums, bootlegs, demos, solo- and side- projects. What ends up on my only ever Random Ten? One mediocre track from Wilco's only mediocre album. Not that there aren't some fortuitous entries: When Holbo was out here last week I actually mentioned Grant Lee Buffalo's &quot;Lonestar Song.&quot; Scott McLemee will dig the appearance by the Drive By Truckers. The Pogues' &quot;If I Should Fall From Grace With God&quot; is the best song off the album of the same name. The Dave Van Ronk &amp; Frankie Armstrong album full of Brecht covers is as good as it seems pretentious. More people should own it. Same with the Jayhawks' Hollywood Town Hall. Sleater-Kinney's &quot;I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone,&quot; while not one of my favorite songs, at least comes from their best period ('95-'99). The list is odd in many respects, however. There's no rap or hip-hop. In fact there aren't any African-American performers on it. It seems I own a racist iRiver. Anyone know if there's a firmware upgrade for that?</span></a></div>
