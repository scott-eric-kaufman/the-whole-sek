        <meta name="description" content="If those on the right stop insisting that the antecedent of Obama's &quot;that&quot; was &quot;business&quot; when it was clearly &quot;roads and bridges&quot; and sundry, those of us on the left will recognize that the subject of Ann Romney's &quot;you people&quot; was clearly the mainstream media. Work for you? Of course not. As to Obama: If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business, you didn’t build that. Antecedents can co-refer across sentence boundaries in English. They just can. (See what I did there?) Moreover, the nearest potential antecedent to a pronoun isn't necessarily the actual antecedent. Consider: The monkey took the banana and ate it. The monkey became sick after it ate the banana. In both cases &quot;the banana&quot; is closer to &quot;it&quot; than &quot;the monkey&quot; is, but in the first sentence &quot;it&quot; refers to &quot;the banana,&quot; whereas in the second sentence &quot;it&quot; refers to &quot;the monkey.&quot; This isn't that difficult people. The &quot;this&quot; in the previous sentence? It doesn't even have a referent. It refers back to the situation of entire text. Now it's doing so over three sentence. It can do it over four. It can do so to infinity if I so choose. That's just how it works. In short: Neither inclusion in the same sentence nor proximity to a pronoun is definitive proof that Obama's &quot;that&quot; refers to &quot;business,&quot; and context makes a strong case that Obama's &quot;that&quot; referred across more than one sentence to a catalog of antecedents including &quot;somebody,&quot; &quot;a great teacher,&quot; another &quot;somebody,&quot; the &quot;American system,&quot; yet another &quot;somebody,&quot; and &quot;roads and bridges.&quot; &quot;That&quot; refers to all that in the same way the second &quot;that&quot; in this sentence does. Simple as that. As to Ann Romney: the phrase &quot;you people&quot; only works as an epithet when it's directed at someone. If I write that I'm going to tell you people about &quot;you people,&quot; none of you people will be offended because I wasn't trying to diminish you people by calling you &quot;you people.&quot; If Mitt Romney had said &quot;you people&quot; during his speech to the NAACP, that'd be a different story. But Ann Romney was being interviewed on ABC News, meaning &quot;you people&quot; clearly refers to the mainstream media so beloved by conservatives everywhere. Which means she might have been using it as an epithet targeted at the mainstream media establishment. All of which is only to say: I've now devoted the last half hour of my life to writing about &quot;that&quot; and &quot;you people,&quot; and I hope that you people enjoy it, because I never want to do so again." />

<p>If this whole triviality has to be turned into something interesting, I&#39;ll point out that Obama here is echoing Elizabeth Warren, and that really in that context it&#39;s not so much of a misinterpretation to characterize the sentiment as &quot;If you&#39;ve got a business, you didn&#39;t build that business [alone]&quot;.  Society, via government, built the infrastructure that your business uses, and educated your workers.  Therefore you don&#39;t have a right to operate your business untaxed and unregulated, it is not your fortress that you built.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t particularly like or trust Obama, or Elizabeth Warren for that matter, so I&#39;ll add that what&#39;s interesting to me about this is that Obama is in various ways tacking left for the election.  Why is he doing that?  Probably because he&#39;s offered the people who he needs to get out the vote for him nothing over his term, and he has to try to appease them with rhetoric and executive orders now.<br />

Well, of course it&#39;s trivially true that antecedents can co-refer across sentence boundaries.  But this is political rhetoric, and it&#39;s an echo of this quote by Elizabeth Warren:</p>

<p>“There is nobody in this country who got rich on their own. Nobody. You built a factory out there - good for you. But I want to be clear. You moved your goods to market on roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate. You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn&#39;t have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory... Now look. You built a factory and it turned into something terrific or a great idea - God bless! Keep a hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.”</p>

<p>The logic of &quot;keep a hunk of it&quot; -- but the rest is society&#39;s, because after all society partly built it -- is at base the same thing that the right wing is criticizing.  Yes, they are going at it with deliberate stupidity and malice, but to reduce every part of this disagreement to a lesson about antecedents and sentence boundaries isn&#39;t being truthful, not really.  It&#39;s not a voice of reason that I recognize, because a voice of reason has to acknowledge actual political disagreements rather than trivializing them.</p></span>

<p>Exasperation and mockery. The former because, well, I&#39;d been grading all day, and reading national political commentary that was as uninformed as a college freshmen bothered me. More from the left than the right, though that&#39;s not how it ended up being distributed in the post. It bothers me when people I otherwise agree with peddle wares as cheap as &quot;you people&quot; is. And the latter because, well, mockery exists for its own sake. </p>

<p><em>It&#39;s not a voice of reason that I recognize, because a voice of reason has to acknowledge actual political disagreements rather than trivializing them.</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s implicit in the critique: if you understand how the pronouns work, you necessarily understand the point Obama/Warren make. Moreover, it is important to indicate why something means what you say it means, even if that meaning is merely implicit. So, it&#39;s trivial what the antecedent of &quot;that&quot; is, but over the next couple of months, that triviality may turn into a significant bit of political rhetoric, so having the specific knowledge required to undermine it is important. Quite a few otherwise intelligent people might want to refute it but not have the knowledge of grammar to do so -- I&#39;m imagining, say, a liberal engineering student -- but now they do. I didn&#39;t get so technical as to make it difficult to understand, which I could&#39;ve done by discussing summative pronouns and the difficulty in the exact distribution of antecedents over multiple sentences, because that&#39;s unnecessarily complex. And I probably should&#39;ve given an example like:</p>

</blockquote>A prosecutor is making his closing argument in a murder case and says this. He says &quot;This person’s DNA was found at the scene. This person was captured on camera fleeing the scene. Numerous witnesses heard him say he would murder the victim earlier. That is why you must find this person guilty.&quot; What does &quot;that&quot; refer to?</blockquote>

<p>More clear cut, but I only thought of it later. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef016768ed76d1970b-content"><p>Following up on this again, because I happened to see <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2012/07/romney_takes_you_didnt_build_that_global.php" rel="nofollow">a post</a> about it, from which is a quote:</p>

<p>&quot;Here I&#39;m not talking about the much larger, phony side of the &quot;you didn&#39;t build that&quot; debacle, where Republicans are pretending Obama said entrepreneurs didn&#39;t build their businesses. That&#39;s run of the mill political hackery. But many conservatives were genuinely offended by the fair reading of Obama&#39;s speech -- that successful entrepreneurs should contribute more to public works, because they&#39;ve benefited the most from them -- because it clashes with their view of what&#39;s most fundamental to individual and group success.&quot;</p>

<p>There is a sense in which exasperation and mockery just confuses the issue even more.  I don&#39;t know whether there is anyone so confused or partisan that they think that Obama was literally saying that businesspeople did not build their businesses in the generally accepted sense.  If there are those people, explaining how pronouns work to them will not help at all.   What the attack is about, other than general noise that means that Obama is anti-business and which can not be refuted because it is noise, is about what the quote above calls the &quot;fair reading&quot;.  That is an actual, honest fair reading of what Obama said, and Republicans are actually outraged by it.  It&#39;s an actual political dispute.  Treating it as a subject for mockery about pronouns seems to me to be about on the same level as taking the &quot;you people&quot; thing in the way that you criticize people for taking it -- as a misreading that makes people feel better for some reason.</p></span>

Make them say the words!</strong> After a series of answers in which Speaker Boehner distances himself from Michele Bachmann’s paranoid concerns about the infiltration of our government by agents of the Muslim Brotherhood, this exchange occurs: Q: Would you consider taking her off the Intelligence Committee? Congresswoman Bachmann? JOHN BOEHNER: I don’t know that that’s related at all. Nor do I. It’s not like the Intelligence Committee is tasked to oversee “the intelligence and intelligence-related activities of 17 elements of the US Government, and the Military Intelligence Program.” It’s not as if a person on said committee sending a letter full of undocumented slanders and strange accusations of cultural capitulation has anything to do with intelligence — either in its governmental or colloquial sense. It’s not like the letter to Inspector General Charles McCullough contains material lifted from the splash page of this website or anything. It’s not as if the letter to Acting Inspector General Lynne Halbrooks demonstrates a “serious concern” about how the government labels things. Except the Halbrooks letter demands an investigation into: The failure of the Army in the aftermath of the Fort Hood massacre to characterize the jihadist motivations of the alleged shooter, a self-declared “Soldier of Allah” Major Nidal Hassan. This was compounded by the after-action investigation which did not even describe the incident as an example of “violent extremism” — the government’s approved euphemism for obscuring jihadism. The use of euphemisms, this letter contends, “may even pose security risks for this nation, its people, and interests.” This makes perfect sense: if I say nothing when they come for my language, I won’t be able to complain when they impose shariah law because they already took my language. Policing language is very important to the authors of these letters, as evidenced by a demand for a corrective action, consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States , to ensure that no Muslim Brotherhood associated entity or individual is placed in a position of honor or trust within the programs and operations of the Department of Defense unless he or she has publicly condemned and disclaimed previously stated goals of the Muslim Brotherhood. They must “publicly condemn.” They want to make some unnamed (and all future) people prove they’ve uprooted some thoughts from their heads. In words. (Presumably before the Brotherhood takes them away.) Failure to do so might “unnecessarily expose U.S. personnel [in Afghanistan] to hostile action and diseases.” They must be made to say the words, or Our Troops might catch diseases. The vector of these hypothetical diseases? Doesn’t matter. It could happen. If none of this makes much sense to you, consider it a compliment, because none of these letters make sense. The boilerplate questions that conclude all of them can be summed up thus: Is anyone under you a Secret Muslim, and if so, has he or she publicly renounced their commitment to “civilization jihad”? What is the current relationship of your Secret Muslims to the Muslim Brotherhood? Have you taken the “corrective action”...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/07/glenn-reynolds-demonstrates-how-to-avoid-politicizing-a-tragedy.html"><span><strong>Glenn Reynolds Demonstrates How to Avoid Politicizing a Tragedy</strong> As everyone who pays attention to political blogging knows, tragedies are too tragic to politicize. Discussing gun control in the wake of a tragic shooting is despicable political opportunism. Discussing the discussion of gun control in the wake of a tragic shooting, however, isn’t politically opportunistic because it’s a morally neutral, second-order discussion about a discussion. It’s a meta-discussion about the propriety of having a political discussion in the wake of a tragic shooting, meaning it’s an apolitical discussion whose participants are immune to the charge that they’re violating decorum by politicizing a tragedy. For example, here’s Glenn Reynolds’s first post about Aurora: A TRULY AWFUL mass shooting in Denver. At the Batman premiere. UPDATE: More here. It doesn’t exploit the tragedy by using it to score cheap political points, so no one could accuse him of political opportunism. But here’s his second post on the tragic shooting: POLITICAL OPPORTUNISM: CNN’s Piers Morgan, First to Use Colorado Tragedy to Assault Second Amendment Rights. I’m sure he won’t be the last. Others may blame Hollywood. In both cases, it’s a mix of opportunism and a desire not to confront the existence of evil. Well, okay, in Piers Morgan’s case, it’s not much of a mix, really. UPDATE: Left Blames Aurora Shooting On Rush Limbaugh. Of course they do. Hey, never let a tragedy go to waste, when you might use it to smear an opponent. Every time something like this happens, they roll out the blood libels. Because conservative bloggers have established that it’s not political opportunism to discuss political opportunism, this technically doesn’t qualify as an exploitation of the tragic shooting, because pointing out other people’s political opportunism isn’t politically opportunistic—even though the people doing the pointing are ideologically opposed to the people they’re pointing at. Every conservative blogger knows that. Reynold’s next post qualifies as non-opportunistic for the same reason: FIRST, ABC NEWS CONNECTS THE COLORADO SHOOTING WITH THE TEA PARTY, now Brian Ross says oops, sorry about that. Reaction: “Brian Ross must be fired by the end of the day.” What’s pathetic is that every time, they so clearly want to blame tragedies like this on the Tea Party. I don’t generally like these calls for firings, and Ross was no doubt just reading what a producer sent him, but . . . They know how to be exquisitely sensitive and non-prejudgey when it might be a Muslim or some other protected minority, so maybe the only way to encourage them to show better judgment the rest of the time is to cost some people their jobs. Who was the producer? Meanwhile, I look forward to the libel suit. . . . UPDATE: ABC News goes into “Damage Control Mode.” ANOTHER UPDATE: Jim Treacher on Twitter: “It’s not even about @BrianRoss. It’s about a subculture with a view of the world in which @BrianRoss’s assumption there is only natural.” MORE: Here’s an interview with the man ABC News libeled. MORE STILL: A roundup of “progressive” scapegoating, some of...</span></a></div>
