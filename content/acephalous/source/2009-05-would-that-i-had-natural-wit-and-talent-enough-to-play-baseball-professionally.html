        <meta name="description" content="Fans of good writing (which, if you're reading this, you clearly are), I would like to introduce you to Chris &quot;Disco&quot; Hayes. He may be rough around the edges, but he has a sense of prose (so rare in an age when so few read) and can turn a phrase. Not surprisingly, he has an analytic turn of mind. But this post is about the writing, so here he is on PFPs (&quot;pitcher's fielding practice&quot;), which consist of a line of pitchers waiting to walk up onto the mound to fake their pitching motion and run over to a ball that has been rolled down the third base line by a pitching coach, pick it up, and throw the ball to a lucky veteran pitcher who is stationed at first base. After completing your turn, you go back to the end of the line and repeat. Once you have been through enough times that you are convinced playing in games is merely a drill to prepare you for PFPs[.] Prior to the start of spring training, I'd advise you begin joining every minor league player in cheering hardest during the World Series not for a team, but for solid PFP work. You see, the first week of spring training for pitchers is a series of lectures from pitching coaches about how important PFPs can be. Imagine the momentum and the voracity with which these lectures were given in the Spring of 2007 after the Tigers' PFP performance in the 2006 World Series. I had cold sweats and my feet started to ache in mere anticipation of the upcoming spring training during game 5 in 2006 as Verlander Bucknered the 5th of his team's 5 PFPs into right field for the 7th and 8th unearned runs en route to losing the series.

not for a team, but for solid PFP work.&#0160; You see, the first week of

I had cold sweats and my feet started to ache in mere anticipation of
the upcoming spring training during game 5 in 2006 as Verlander
Bucknered the 5th of his team&#39;s 5 PFPs into right field for the 7th and
8th unearned runs en route to losing the series. <br /></div><p>On <a href="http://discohayes.mlblogs.com/archives/2009/02/its_all_greek_to_me.html">being humbled by a physical and humiliated by a physician</a>:</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">My calves are really the one and only
attribute of my body people might look at in a body catalog and want
to order for themselves. My ankles are skinny and athletic-looking
and my calves are well defined. [F]rom the

Achilles and says, &quot;Make sure you stretch this out well, it&#39;s a bit
tight.&quot; I take it to heart (though it nearly breaks mine) and nod
my head. Duly noted. <br /></div><p class="blockquote" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 40px;">And then the joke hits me. It&#39;s witty,
it&#39;s relevant ... ah, it&#39;s perfect. It happens so fast, before I
know it my lips are making a coy, dry grin to indicate I&#39;m about to
be a smart alec.&#0160; I figure the Doctor has a hundred physicals to
perform, I might as well make a part of his day funny. Accordingly,
I ask, &quot;Would you say it&#39;s my Achilles Heel?&quot; I swear I&#39;m not
making this up. It was so perfect. Contextually ... My entire body
functions perfectly, but there&#39;s one specific area that may be a flaw
that could lead to an injury? <em>And</em> it&#39;s my Achilles? Gold. 
Well played, Mr. Hayes. Delivery was good. Timing: better.</p>

<p class="blockquote" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 40px;">Everything came together like a sinker
just a wink below the knees that gets wrapped to the shortstop for a
double play. The batter practically slipped coming out of the box.</p>

<p class="blockquote" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 40px;">I&#39;m obnoxiously proud of my wit at this
point. I feel like I&#39;ve teed the &quot;uncontrollable belly-laughter&quot;
golf ball up and handed the Doctor the biggest of Big Berthas. In a
way, now, I&#39;m glad the calves and ankles I love so much have been
hated on simply for the sake of this joke. It&#39;s well worth it. 
Unless, someho—</p>

<p class="blockquote" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 40px;">&quot;No, not the heel, just the tendon.&quot; </p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 40px;">The Doctor pats me on the shoulder and looks at the next pitcher in
line. Not even a smile. He said it assuringly, like I really
thought it was my tight heel, but everything was going to be OK. He
raises his eyebrows indicating the end of my physical. And it is. I
walk cautiously (so as to not rupture anything) to the calf-stretcher
and sink my head, dropping my gaze to my suspect heel. I can&#39;t help
but notice my splendid calves.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">On <a href="http://discohayes.mlblogs.com/archives/2009/04/step_1_get_signed.html">going undrafted</a>:</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 40px;">You&#39;d think with 1500 selections, getting
drafted is a pretty easy way to get signed.&#0160; And it should be.&#0160; In
fact, on the second day of the draft while you listen to name after
name get called, a number of teams will stop drafting players after
round 45.&#0160; At this point, you realize you are not getting passed over
for another player, but rather getting passed over for no one.&#0160;&#0160; Your
absence is worth more than your presence to 30 organizations.&#0160; </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Nothing really to add other than as somehow who teaches writing professionally, I&#39;d kill to get my hands on this kid.&#0160; By the way, I think I accidentally found out I won some sort of teaching award.&#0160; It was an email in which everyone referred to me in the third person, which leads me to believe I wasn&#39;t supposed to be a recepient.&#0160; </p>

I yield the floor to the gentlemen from Georgia: “It’s something I’d have to think through with respect to whatever issues might be forthcoming that the court may have to consider.” More interesting than the predictable hypocrisy of bigots are the reponses from Session’s compatriots: “It’s not been part of the calculus for me,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. “I have never, frankly, thought about that situation,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the GOP standard-bearer in the 2008 presidential election. “I’ve never thought about it,” said Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.). Why did it never cross their minds that a gay person might aspire to a position on the highest court of the land? Most would say it has something to do with them being incapable of sympathizing with a good chunk of their constituency. They wouldn’t be wrong. But I like to think this befuddlement a sign that the rainbow cloaks and resplendent daggers of the great homosexual conspiracy learned how to hide in plain sight. Instead of months of comminuted innuendo that amount to the fear that someone might someday marry his dog, conservatives will stroll blithely down the corridors of power completely unaware that a certain piece of legislation might be good for the gays until it’s too late to do anything about it.

For some reason, I thought last year was largely drama-free, and it was . . . except for all the drama. (I'll save my meta-thoughts about Proust and journals for another day.) The Funny: Elderly Jews deserve our scorn. HA HA HA not funny. IT IS ALWAYS ALREADY CURTAINS FOR ME! In what follows I will be writing about signposts. I am become Hunter S. Thompson. This a finely crafted I wrote. What is it, with students and, with commas? Dawg, we is underscrewed. The Great California Earthquake Drill of 2008. Who will weep for the ugly duckling? &quot;He longs longingly at his creation, his only wish that he could experience its birth again.&quot; Cylons have to eat too. &quot;It is a descriptive word. Its description is emotional and resonates to people who have emotions.&quot; .edoc eht kcarc ot sdrawkcab ti daeR Why this blog isn't good anymore. Nothing is ever merely anything. ASCII is too awesome. Interview with a candidate for many jobs (but winner of none). Never has the ding been so pleasant. Tell me everything I need to know to be an expert. &quot;fine i dont hear from u soon u reget it[.]&quot; A brief history of bobulates. Never let cats chat. A goal accomplished. SEK is hating Facebook. Then Socrates admits it was always about the hats. Who among us doesn't aspire to be the Manny Ramirez of academia? &quot;I devoted my life to that study for nearly three weeks, but when I re-read it, I realized I was utterly full of shit.&quot; My best Charles Atlas imitation. The Serious: This day in (fictional) history. Because who ever saw a black person swimming? Can anyone justify teaching Huck Finn? Liberal Fascism is a rank stupid book. No, really, Liberal Fascism is a rank stupid book. That thing I did with the voter registration data that got linked everywhere but was stupid dull writing-wise. The fine line between literary criticism and rank paranoia. That would be pretty damn important. Who really wrote that book the with the pResident's name on it? The first ever time I mentioned Watchmen on the blog. His death still bothers me. John Ziegler is an asshole. Two bits on The Wire. The Still Seriously Sad: &quot;.&quot;</span></a></div>
