I&#39;ll tell you how I know<br />
I read it in the paper<br />
Fifteen years ago<br />
We&#39;re all driving rocket ships<br />
And talking with our minds<br />
And wearing turquoise jewelry<br />
And standing in soup lines<br />
We are standing in soup lines</i> -- <a href="http://www.cowboylyrics.com/lyrics/prine-john/living-in-the-future-10866.html" rel="nofollow">John Prine, &quot;Living in the Future&quot;</a></p>

<p>Introducing the song on his live album he says that it was supposed to be about the future, but it took him seven years to write, so at best it&#39;s about the present. Jeanne Dixon has days like that.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago I would have scoffed at the idea of presidential dynasties, the US becoming a colonial power, or me being an historian. Stuff happens.</p></span>

<p>I don&#39;t, myself.  My argument is: we&#39;re not Brits.  Since we pronounce the &quot;h,&quot; we should say &quot;a history&quot; or &quot;a historian.&quot;</p>

		<span id="comment-93774388-content"><p>I&#39;ll address the easiest issue first:</p>

<p><em>Who here agrees with placing &quot;an&quot; in front of &quot;history&quot; or &quot;historian&quot;?</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s not that we&#39;re British, it&#39;s the first syllable of &quot;historian&quot; is unstressed, whereas the first syllable of &quot;history&quot; is.  Because the unstressed &quot;h&quot; is inaudible, it falls under the rule we use for &quot;an.&quot;  So, technically: &quot;An historian writes a history.&quot;  The flip side of this is when &quot;u&quot; functions as a consonant sound, as in &quot;uniform.&quot;  No one ever says &quot;an uniform&quot; or &quot;an universe.&quot;  Same rule.  It&#39;s only rendered a little awkward in the case of &quot;historian&quot; because some dialects aspirate the &quot;h.&quot;</p>

<p>(Such are the things you learn while doing eight years of speech therapy.) </p>

<p>Now for the more complicated stuff.</p></span>

<p>&quot;Scooter&quot;?  Who is this &quot;Scooter&quot; person of whom you speak?  I&#39;ve never been <em>heard of</em> him.</p>

<p>But yes, I know it&#39;s more often short-cut than social statement -- as opposed to Wallace&#39;s &quot;Year of the Glad,&quot; mentioned above -- but it still irks me when pharmaceutical companies and science fiction authors try to walk the fine line between transparency and scientific sounding.  </p>

<p>Jon,</p>

<p>I initially read that as &quot;tralalafil,&quot; which sounds like treatment for a sore Diane Keaton.</p>

<p>Patterico,</p>

<p><em>See, to me, it&#39;s audible. I can see how the lack of a stress could arguably make it slightly less audible, but I think the same would go for &quot;uniform&quot; and &quot;uniformity.&quot;</em></p>

<p>The stress pattern&#39;s aren&#39;t the same though: the first syllables of &quot;uniform&quot; and &quot;uniformity&quot; are both stressed, and the &quot;u&quot; functions as &quot;y&quot; ini both instances, so it&#39;s not quite the same as history/historian.</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/some-people-ear.html"><span><strong>Some People Earn Their Infamy: Chuck Adkins, Terrible &quot;Person&quot;</strong> A reader wanting to cheer me up sent me a link to this site, the horrors of which I don't want to plumb. But I will. I won't mention that the proprietor of The Populist Blog, &quot;Chuck Adkins,&quot; purportedly lives in his parent's basement. (No reason to put substance to the stereotype.) Nor will I say anything about &quot;his&quot; decision to insult the recently deceased wife of someone he was arguing with. (Why remind people of the niceties of online interaction?) I'm not even going to discuss the remarkable sense of self-importance necessary to address &quot;everyone&quot; when not a single post on any of his many blogs bears comments. I won't speak to any of that ... because I don't believe &quot;Chuck Adkins&quot; exists. He's a fictional character, confabulated by irate conservatives in desperate need of a straw man. How else could he embody the worst stereotypes of liberals and bloggers both? There's a reason everyone who links to his blog does so with rage in their heart and violence on their mind. (As a future English professional, I see red every time he Capitalizes Words like a German. I know he thinks it's &quot;Sort of Bad news&quot; that he &quot;had to nuke the Blog,&quot; but if the news is &quot;Bad&quot; and the &quot;Blog&quot; is nuked, doesn't his illogic dictate the News of the Nuking also be capitalized?) Were Adkins an actual person, he would occasionally write something that didn't play into the conservative stereotype of vile liberals ... like voicing complaint against kicking welfare kittens for being cute, or demonstrating that Bush misled the country about the threat Saddam's chemical weapons program posed. Instead, Adkins always produces material like: Two words asshole, fuck off. Further More, what the fuck is it to you? I mean, if you don’t fucking like what you see here, don’t bother fucking coming here. Update 2: Yeah, I took it off, I wouldn’t want little cry baby azzhat Mikey to cry himself silly, the bitch. Mother fucker lets his Co-Bloggers talk shit about other Blogs, But then WHINES when someone writes a little snark back. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Cry baby assed bitch. I will forewarn you fucking asshole chickenhawks. THE VERY NEXT TIME, THAT MICHELLE MALKIN POSTS SOMETHING THAT *i* DON’T LIKE, I WILL POST HER REAL NAME, TELEPHONE NUMBERS, CREDIT CARD INFO AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS, WITH SHOTS OF THE HOUSE FROM THE AIR. It’s okay for her to do shit, and say shit, but when I do it, I catch hell. BULLSHIT! Even if I have to PAY to get the info, I will get it. Bank on it, bitches. Update: Hello to all the readers from ColdFury! I’ve since posted a follow up, you might wanna read it. Like I said on that posting, if Mike wants to be a gentleman and pull the post insulting me, Fine, I’ll pull this one and the one linked. Otherwise, it stays. I’ve never said a THING about anyone over at Coldfury, ever. But yet, they’ll...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/home-for-the-ho.html"><span><strong>Home for the Holidays</strong> Like many others, I'll be heading home for the holidays, then to the MLA after them, so expect posting to be pretty light—wait—what's that? I'm not headed home for the holidays? What do you mean I put my wife on an airplane and sent to her to my parents' house this morning? Why would I do that? Why wouldn't I go with her? A sick cat? Could that really put all my holiday plans on hold? Of course it could. So while my wife is off being feted by my parents, I'm stuck at home with a little lady who may need to have some toes amputated. That's the bad news. The good news is that cats have their toes amputated quite regularly in the States, so the surgery (if necessary) will be routine. Quick Clarification: I'm not wantonly declawing Rachel. She has tumors growing on three of the toes of her back left paw, which the vet removed yesterday and is testing today. The reason she stopped eating and drinking a month back was because the litter in the litter box hurt her toes. That's why she ended up with a distended bladder. The pain medication and appetite stimulant she'd been taking masked the pain, but apparently it got too bad again this weekend. I took her back to the vet and we found the tumors. Thing is, she had a full-body scan a month ago, and the vet pulled it up on the monitor and we looked and looked and looked for sign of the tumors, but we couldn't find any. The foot must've been uncomfortable to her before modern medicine could detect the tumors. So all the problems seem to have stemmed from these toes—the not eating, the not voiding, the lethargy, and she also lost a pound, which for a cat is 1/10th of total body weight. All because of her toes.</span></a></div>
