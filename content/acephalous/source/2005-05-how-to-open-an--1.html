<p class="MsoNormal">The problem with this approach is that it's awful cute.&nbsp; Not cute like a bunny, a pony, a puppy or a kitten, but cute like a bunny, pony, puppy or kitten who reads Derrida, mistakes academic puns for scholarly insights, and loves little more in life than jamming dashes, brackets, and parentheses into words.&nbsp; Cute like a critic who thinks appending a definitive article to a word transforms it into a concept--<em>e.g. </em>&quot;the preposterous&quot;--and who, unable to leave well enough alone, then demonstrates how &quot;the preposterous&quot; is a function of the anticipation and subsequent disappointment of sexual gratification; that is, how &quot;the preposterous&quot; is really the &quot;the pre/post(Eros).&quot;&nbsp; Cute like that. <br /><br />Since Good Sir, I Implore You! forces readers to understand the complexity of a historical moment, all the potential excessive cuteness can be shoved aside by transforming it into its more pedestrian counterpart, the Historical Anecdote: </p>

<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Darwin’s <em>Origin of Species by National Selection </em>is exciting much interest

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">

 -Anonymous Review, <em>The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature</em>,
March 1860</span></p>

<p>Shortly after reading this review of Darwin’s new work in the
current <em>Eclectic</em>, Theophilus Parsons
found himself glancing past the soft leather spine of a first edition <em>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural
Selection </em>(1859), mulling its ambiguous title. He knew Darwin’s
work was “exciting much interest,” brimming with “novelty” and written with
“ability.” But what, exactly, was it
about? Were he a student of philosophy,
he would have thought it a treatment of the Platonic Ideas, Forms, or <em>Species</em>, an examination of the apodictic
reality beyond the illusions of human experience. Were he a logician, he would expect a discussion
of the second of the five Predicables, that “Term affirmed of several things,
which must express their whole essence, which is called a <em>Species</em>&quot;; a Catholic, a treatise on the transubstantiation of bread and wine, the
Eucharistic <em>species</em>, into the Very
Body and Blood of Christ Himself; a politician, a banker, or a metallurgist, an
account of “the different Rates at which the same <em>Species</em> of Foreign Coins do pass,” or of how “paper securities
[are] held out as a currency … in lieu of the two great recognized <em>species</em> [gold and silver] that represent
the lasting conventional credit of mankind.”<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on"></st1:city></st1:place>&nbsp; Darwin 
frustrates potential readers, then as now, because, as John Dewey says, “few

<a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6"></a>*Theophilus Parsons was, in fact, an early reader of <em>On the Origin of Species</em>. While serving as the Dane Professor of Law at Harvard University,
Parsons wrote one of its first American reviews in the <em>American Journal of Science and the Arts</em>, November 1860, 30:
1. His review concludes with speculation
similar in form, though not chosen personage, to that with which I open this
chapter.</div></div></blockquote><p>I've included the explanatory footnote because it captures the difference between the hypothetical general reader I wrote into existence above and the actual historical figure, Theophilus Parsons, through whom I focalize all the confusion here.&nbsp; Among the various families of Historical Anecdotes, the one I've written here belongs to the species <em>Anecdota relevanta</em>.&nbsp; I could have begun this essay with a discussion of Balinese cockfighting or tourist attractions in natural parks, but I didn't.&nbsp; (Don't worry: Greenblatt's on the agenda and will be discussed in time.&nbsp; &nbsp;By which I mean &quot;tomorrow.&quot;)&nbsp; I chose instead to embody the confusion I earlier implored me readers to feel in an actual person who was, as it turns out, actually confused.&nbsp; The strengths of this approach--besides the unbridled joy I feel whenever I type &quot;Theophilus Parsons,&quot; a.k.a. the Second Stuffiest Man Alive as Judged by Name Alone--are in its conventionality.&nbsp; It's not cute so much as appropriate.&nbsp; Dull and appropriate.&nbsp; But appropriate nonetheless.</p>

<p>Stay tuned, folks, as tomorrow I'll move away from navel-gazing and return to scholar-hazing as I discuss the relative merits of the Balinese Cockfight and the Call to Arms.</p>

<p>&quot;I first became interested in evolutionary theory when, as a child growing up in a strict Baptist community in Mississippi, I discovered a reference to Darwin in my father&#39;s newspaper.  &#39;Daddy, what&#39;s evolutionary theory?&#39; I asked him.  &#39;That&#39;s the work of Satan, son,&#39; he replied, and reached behind the couch for the strap.  For the next three hours, he mutely whalloped my bare ass, while my mother and sister looked on, clutching their bibles and solemnly intoning the psalms.  He meant to drive evolution out of my soul forever, but with each stroke of the leather, Darwin was driven further in.  Two decades later, I was in graduate school, searching about for a thesis topic with which to masochistically punish myself for the next several years.  Darwin was indelibly associated in my mind with the pain and pleasure of the leather on my ass, and thus I came to write this study.&quot;</p></span>

To counter this and similar withering denunciations, many academics fluff up their introductions with the Self-Aggrandizing Personal Anecdote (SAPA). Since the SAPA frequently involves the dropping of names known to no one outside the academy, institutions often bear the load. For instance, in an essay entitled &quot;Mao II and the War on Terrorism,&quot; one SAP (Self-Aggrandizing Person) informs general and academic readers alike of his important contributions to the New York Times' coverage of September 11th: Shortly after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon and the crash of hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11, 2001, I received a call from a reporter at the New York Times. Emily Eakin was working on a story about modern literature's response to earlier forms of terror, in particular the fictional representations of Russian revolutionaries in Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Possessed (1871–72) and European anarchists in Henry James's The Princess Casamassima (1886) and Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent (1907). Eakin reasonably assumed that great literature offers us means of coping with crises like September 11 and that this specific event was not historically unique. We talked by phone and e-mail about the national agendas of early modern revolutionary movements and the global terrorist aims of the Islamic fundamentalist Al-Qaeda, including the aesthetic means required to represent these different political cultures and historical periods. Call Don DeLillo, I urged Eakin, and read Mao II, his literary analysis of postmodern terrorism. Then call Jody McAuliffe and Frank Lentricchia at Duke, who are producing a dramatization of the novel in the spring of 2002. Eakin phoned none of the above and certainly did not read Mao II for her story. Reporters have deadlines; her story appeared eleven days after September 11. In a single introductory paragraph, this SAP earns his name. Through a personal anecdote readers learn that his name and number grace a card in one of the 4,397 rolodexes owned by people affiliated with New York Times; that he not only knows everything a person ought to know about forms of terrorism historical and contemporary; that he knows big shots like Frank Lentricchia and possesses inside information about upcoming theatrical performances of mediocre works of contemporary American literature; and finally, the reader learns how much better this SAP is than the one who called him for information on a topical news story because she didn't fulfill what this SAP, in the first sentence of the second paragraph, calls &quot;the luxury and responsibility&quot; of the scholar. Reading this SAP's introduction one would think Eakin didn't take any of his advice. (One would also think this SAP consulted because of his expertise about &quot;the aesthetic means required to represent these different political cultures and historical periods.&quot; In her article, however, it's clear that Eakins consulted this SAP because, in her words, he's &quot;a James scholar.&quot; I'm sure our SAP...</span></a></div>
