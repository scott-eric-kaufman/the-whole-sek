Let me walk you through his argument: An author intends &quot;readers to imagine that certain things were the case; that is, he intended his readers to imagine certain states of affair.&quot; Furthermore, an author also intends &quot;those imagined states of affairs to to be connected to each other in ways that would sustain certain logical inferences from one to the other.&quot; Were this author Milton--the subject of the first chapter--he would have &quot;intended his reader to imagine states of affair whose interconnections would be tight enough, for example, to sustain an inference from Eve's speaking to Eve's having a mouth; or from Adam's standing to Adam's being in contact with the ground&quot; (9). Knapp's rhetorical strategy here is almost Darwinian in its cunning. Darwin opens The Origin with a discussion of selective breeding--a commonplace of human society since we've settled down--because he knows that if he builds on common sense he's locked his readers down. Knapp works in the same vein: first he convinces you that if Eve speaks she has a mouth, then throws a viscious left and sends you reeling: What happens if the rest of the work doesn't logically follow in the same way Eve's speaking entails her having a mouth? Since the world the author wanted to create cannot meet the Eve's-speech-to-Eve's-mouth standard of logical implication, Knapp wonders whether the author's foisted his authorial responsibility onto his readers. &quot;[A] critic is empowered to imagine additional states of affairs that will enhance the coherence of the world projected by the author,&quot; Knapp argues, &quot;even if the states of affairs thus added are utterly foreign to the author's intentions&quot; (25).

			<p>I promised to dish about <em>Literary Interest </em>and have so far failed to follow through.&nbsp; But I have a reason:</p>

<p>Despite being a straightforward read free of jargon and impressive citations, Knapp's book bedevils those who desire summary.&nbsp; The prose consists of tight argumentative knots which defy <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/a_respose_to_the_deconstructive_angel/#2325">citational logic</a>.&nbsp; (Though maybe not <em>that </em>way.)&nbsp; Especially interesting is the manner in which his prose enacts his argument about authorized implicature (about which more momentarily).&nbsp; Let me walk you through his argument:</p>

<p>An author intends &quot;readers to imagine that certain things were the case; that is, he intended his readers to imagine certain states of affair.&quot;&nbsp; <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/darwin_charles_london_england_1.jpg"><img width="100" height="75" border="0" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/darwin_charles_london_england_1.jpg" title="Darwin_charles_london_england_1" alt="Darwin_charles_london_england_1" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>Furthermore, an author also intends &quot;those imagined states of affairs to to be connected to each other in ways that would sustain certain logical inferences from one to the other.&quot;&nbsp; Were this author Milton--the subject of the first chapter--he would have &quot;intended his reader to imagine states of affair whose interconnections would be tight enough, for example, to sustain an inference from Eve's speaking to Eve's having a mouth; or from Adam's standing to Adam's being in contact with the ground&quot; (9).&nbsp; Knapp's rhetorical strategy here is almost <a href="http://hnn.us/comments/66766.html">Darwinian</a> in its cunning.&nbsp; Darwin opens <em>The Origin </em>with a discussion of selective breeding--a commonplace of human society since we've settled down--because he knows that if he builds on common sense he's locked his readers down.&nbsp; Knapp works in the same vein: first he convinces you that if Eve speaks she has a mouth, then throws a viscious left and sends you reeling:</p>

<p>What happens if the rest of the work doesn't logically follow in the same way Eve's speaking entails her having a mouth?<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=800,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/29425578stopsign.jpg"><img width="100" height="100" border="0" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/29425578stopsign.jpg" title="29425578stopsign" alt="29425578stopsign" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>&nbsp; Since the world the author wanted to create cannot meet the Eve's-speech-to-Eve's-mouth standard of logical implication, Knapp wonders whether the author's foisted his authorial responsibility onto his readers.&nbsp; &quot;[A] critic is empowered to imagine additional states of affairs that will enhance the coherence of the world projected by the author,&quot; Knapp argues, &quot;even if the states of affairs thus added are utterly foreign to the author's intentions&quot; (25).&nbsp; The sign to the left says it all.&nbsp; How can the coherence of an author's imagined world rely on the work of critics who would would &quot;enhance the coherence of the world projected by the author <em>even if the states of affairs thus added are utterly foreign to the author's intentions</em>.&quot;&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewbacca_Defense">That makes no sense</a>.&nbsp; Or so it seems.</p>

<p>According to Knapp, an author <em>invests</em> in his work as coherent a world as he can muster because he knows his readers will <em>speculate </em>on its value.&nbsp; Is Knapp introducing an economic metaphor into his formulation?&nbsp; </p>

<p>He is.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Only it's not his.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It belongs to Keats and Boccaccio.</p>

<p>Knapp is no Keats.&nbsp; Knapp is no Boccaccio.&nbsp; If you sense the imminent arrival of an argument akin to the Darwinian argument alluded to above, you've more insight into <del>Knappy</del> Knappian thought than I.&nbsp; Tomorrow I'll continue working through his argument for you.&nbsp; In the meantime I'd be really interested in hearing where you think he's headed.&nbsp; Not because I enjoy the feeling of rank superiority which accompanies posts in which I summarize books you haven't read.&nbsp; I'm not <em>that </em>kind of asshole.&nbsp; I only wonder if Knapp's rigor is so rigorous that people smarter than me can connect-the-dots faster than I can.&nbsp; </p>

		<span id="comment-8672116-content"><p><i>&#39;How can the coherence of an author&#39;s imagined world rely on the work of critics who would &quot;enhance the coherence of the world projected by the author even if the states of affairs thus added are utterly foreign to the author&#39;s intentions.&quot;&#39;</i></p>

<p>This is a false paradox because the existence of the text establishes the distinction between &quot;an author&#39;s imagined world&quot; and &quot;the world projected by the author&quot;. The word &quot;author&quot; is used literally in the first phrase and figuratively in the second, where it stands for &quot;text&quot;. Also, &quot;world&quot; should be plural -- but more on that in a bit.</p>

<p>Anyway, I can picture Knapp&#39;s initial move being useful as a clearing away gesture, but it seems more like a weed-whacker than like fertile soil. How strongly is he stressing the empowerment of this &quot;empowered&quot; critic? Because that in itself isn&#39;t enough to explain what we go to literature or to critics for. Out of effectively infinite texts and infinite worlds extractable from them, something&#39;s being used to decide between:</p>

<p>a) Reading <i>Ulysses</i> with a 1904 Dublin street directory by your side.<br />
b) Reading a 1904 Dublin street directory with <i>Ulysses</i> by your side.<br />
c) Reading a 1993 Manhattan White Pages with a 1904 Dublin street directory by your side.</p>

<p>Whatever the heuristics are, they&#39;re not limited to what can be definitely established as the author&#39;s intentions, and many authors try to stay alert to that in the <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the_liebestod_of_the_author/" rel="nofollow">course of writing</a>. No matter how much the author &quot;invests&quot; in this awareness, though, if the work continues to be read, the gross readerly &quot;speculation&quot; will always outstrip the author&#39;s investment (or at least move to different currency at some point), and so the usefulness of the economic terminology seems to collapse very quickly.</p>

<p>I have no idea where Knapp&#39;s going, but I know <a href="http://www.pseudopodium.org/kokonino/worldmk.html" rel="nofollow">one place <i>I</i> went</a> from the same start: Since this is an obvious aspect of literary reading, obviously some writers and readers will want to play with it. In a science fiction fan&#39;s strong misreading of Milton (akin to Thurber&#39;s &quot;The Macbeth Murder Mystery&quot;), Eve might be mouthless. And in Blake&#39;s strong misreading, God might be the villain.<br />

		<span id="comment-8687829-content"><p>Having posted such an absurdly long comment, I might as well add to it to forestall possible misreadings of my own.</p>

<p>Given Knapp&#39;s field, he&#39;d have to address why we&#39;d call Blake and the sf fan mis-readers -- why we might admit their extracted Miltonic worlds to be amusing or valuable without necessarily calling them valid scholarly criticism. And I don&#39;t think we can put all the blame on Milton for having invested insufficient funds in <i>Paradise Lost</i>. It also has something to do with what rules are being followed -- what heuristics are preferred -- in the contemporary critic&#39;s game, including the collection of evidence as to the author&#39;s possible imagined worlds. So I&#39;d hope he&#39;s headed in that direction.</p>

<p>(Also, congratulations on the half-birthday.)<br />

		<span id="comment-8838125-content"><p>I enjoy reading your blog, but this post was not one of your finest hours (as you admit in your follow-up post, though I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s for the right reasons). The big problem is that the statement by Knapp you quote -- &quot;[A] critic is empowered to imagine additional states of affairs that will enhance the coherence of the world projected by the author, even if the states of affairs thus added are utterly foreign to the author&#39;s intentions&quot; -- which you take for Knapp&#39;s own view, is actually a view that Knapp states only to reject. He rejects it in the very next paragraph, in fact, and for the same reason that you do: &quot;the fact that Milton or any author has failed to project the world he intended to project is altogether irrelevant to the fact that a critic can revise the content of an imagined world by imagining states of affairs that go beyond authorial intention.&quot; (Knapp, 25)</p>

<p>The primary question Knapp is asking in this chapter is whether it is possible for a work of literature to necessarily mean something other than what the author intended it to mean, using <i>Paradise Lost</i> as a test case. As would be expected from the co-author of &quot;Against Theory,&quot; Knapp&#39;s answer is &quot;no.” He first rehearses the argument that the imagined world of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, as intended by Milton, is logically inconsistent: specifically, that though Milton&#39;s God is perfectly good, and therefore must always act justly, his actions towards Adam and Eve are unjust. (Knapp calls this the Romantic Argument.) If we grant, for the sake of Knapp’s argument, that the Romantic Argument is true, we may be tempted to rescue the coherence of <i>Paradise Lost</i> at the expense of Milton’s intention, by positing that the God of the poem is not God as Milton conceived Him, but a being like the Gnostic Demiurge: powerful, but either not benevolent or not omniscient. But Knapp rejects this option, basically on the grounds that once you allow the critic to “imagine additional states of affairs” that are not part of the author’s intention, there is no reason to limit the allowable “supplements” solely to those that enhance the work’s coherence, and in fact no way to limit the allowable supplements at all, thus allowing any work to trivially possess an infinite number of “meanings.”</p></span>

Alas! I had to check my email, and it contained the graduate seminar descriptions for the fall quarter. Since I've been having this conversation about the extent to which literary studies houses Theory quite a bit lately, I can't help myself: I will post some of the course descriptions of some of the upcoming UCI English, Comparative Literature and Critical Theory Emphasis seminars below the fold. Lest I seem to be attacking the venerable institution which will someday (maybe even soon) authorize all the shit I've stuffed in my head the past six years, I should note that, as a genre, the &quot;course description&quot; suffers from the same Madison Avenue-inflected bombast of theory or anti-theory anthologies, i.e. just as you must buy this anthology over all other anthologies so must you attend this seminar above all other seminars. Wow. Amazing what'll spur Seder flashbacks. If I could figure out how to type in Hebrew, I'd impress you all by reproducing the Four Questions which must be answered once a year, every year, by the youngest, drunkest Jew at the table during what's supposed to be a celebration of the Egyptian Exodus. (As recounted in one of the books of the Original Testament. Which one escapes me for the moment. I'll be brainier come morning.) Since I'm unable to impress you with the modicum of Hebrew I acquired during a decade of Wednesday evenings spent attending Hebrew school, I'll have to settle for saying that to my knowledge these seminar descriptions aren't different from all other seminar descriptions. We &quot;Irvinites&quot; don't place pillows behind our heads and backs to differentiate this seminar from all other seminars. We're not required by the Lord who brought us out of Egypt to be Our Lord to sing the most entertaining and repetitive song ever written; one which is both called and seemingly consists only of the word dahyenu. Typical lyrics run the gamut from dahy-dahyenu, dahy-dahyenu to dahy-dahy-enu, dahy-dahy-enu, dahy-dahy-enu, dahyenu, dahyenu! Few songs are more fun to sing but none are more fun to sing as an increasingly drunk fourth grader. (I'm convinced that Andy Merrill, creator and writer of The Brak Show, is both Jewish and Dahyenu's biggest fan. How else to explain &quot;The Song that Never Ends&quot;?) We neither drink to excess as the Lord commandeth nor do we leave any alcohol for Elijah. We know Elijah's the absent-presence of all that's phallogocentric...alright, alright, we know that Elijah's an absent-presence who somehow manages to imbibe a goblet of wine better left for the Easter Bunny. Because if you had to choose between a guy whose name--in Hebrew Eliyahu, which just so happens to my Hebrew name and is the name (abbreviated as &quot;Eli&quot;) I went by for about half of my formative years--means &quot;my God's name is Yahu&quot; and the Easter Bunny, who would you prefer do the drinking? But I...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/08/acephalous_is_s.html"><span><strong>Acephalous is Six Months Old! or Praises Be I've Survived!</strong> [Note: Amardeep's comment prodded me to finish this post. Since its continuation sounds as indulgent as I thought it would, I've left it there in the comment section. But if you really want to you can read it.] In eleven days Acephalous will have been around for six months. Happy Birthday Acephalous! What can I say? You began as a necessary distraction during a year in which I accomplished almost nothing. That angered me, and that anger confused me because it had been years since anything had pinched the nipples of my soul. I hadn't sweat the small stuff since high school and couldn't be bothered to nearly a decade later. So what did I do with my anger? I started you! I wanted to channel all these useless afflictions into something productive. I had tired of the typical existential wallowing that follows any brush with mortality and I hadn't written a damn thing in months. I would prepare for class and teach and return home exhausted. Then you came around. I haven't been the same since. When you were first conceived you were nothing but an outlet for the unabated anger of a recent cancer survivor. You've since become so much more. You invented yourself an author by the name of &quot;A. Cephalous&quot; who posted hither and thither. &quot;A. Cephalous&quot; earned himself a reputation and then was subsumed into He Who Is Scott Eric Kaufman. (He became the guy in the middle unworthy of the women to his right, your left. Before you ask, he also became the guy whose mother is more Irish than Irish and the guy whose beard grows in bright Irish-Red despite his otherwise stereotypically Semetic features. He also knows how silly this genetic essentialism is. But his beard's still bright red if allowed &quot;philosopher-length.&quot;) This post began with a point. It was to be a retrospective of the evolution of the way in which Acephalous has mattered to me, but it will have to settle for knowing that without it my cancerous anger at universal injustice may've vented itself in far less productive directions. I could say that one of the reasons I groped for The Valve-preservers was because at that moment anger and argument were all I had. That and Wilco. But Jeff Tweedy could only inspire me. He could do nothing for the doldrums that had parked themselves on my jet stream. So I waited-out the weather but the weather did out-wait me. And here I am. Six months later. No longer &quot;A. Cephalous&quot; but myself. No longer chock-full of cancer but filled to the brim with healthy cells. And now you have pictures. Happy birthday Acephalous who is not &quot;A. Cephalous.&quot; Thank you for the survival. (Tomorrow night we'll resume the serious arguments about Zizek, Knapp and Theory. Tonight we eat cake.)</span></a></div>
