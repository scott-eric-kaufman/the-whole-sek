		<span id="comment-4988145-content"><p>I&#39;m just happy that an elementary school, somewhere in the United States, is still trying to sell Darwin to the kiddies, rather than pandering to the dumb-ass fundamentalist creationists.  If cookies and pies are what it takes, then damn it folks, let&#39;s start baking.  Hook those little buggers by the sweet-touth while they&#39;re young. Civilization is at stake.</p>

<p>Just imagine, someplace in Kansas right now, kids might be baking Devil&#39;s food cake Satans planting rice-crispie square dinosaur fossils for the abortion-seeking, marzipan liberals back East.  Until a gingerbread beast of the apocalypse slaughters them all and redeems the angel-food cake true believers.</p></span>

It&#39;s like that thrill when you see that you&#39;re first person since 1953 to retrieve the book from the stacks. Those are the books I always want to write about.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-14086196-content"><p>I share your thrill at the prospect of lost gems, and to be honest, I&#39;ve often thought of systematically reviving old posts in order to spark further conversation.  There&#39;s no law against it, and it&#39;s <i>so friggin&#39; easy</i>, but the blog conventions dictate novelty Novelty NOVELTY! be the format&#39;s guiding principle.  People seem hostile to the thought of revision, as I note every time John re-posts a revision of one of his posts.  They shouldn&#39;t be, since revision is what separates careful scholars from curious cranks.  Bah.  Maybe it&#39;s grading student papers all day that makes me want to write a paean to revision . . .</p></span>

Is it any wonder conservatives so desperately want to crack open our little liberal monopoly on the good life? If there are any volunteers to read my prospectus before I send it off tomorrow, I'd appreciate the help. I should finish the section on the decidedly Lamarckian evolution of traditionally animated Funshine Bear into CGI monstrosity Funshine Bear by hour's end. I'll post and open it up for comments shortly thereafter.</span></a></div>
