        <meta name="description" content="(Not being the second part in the Acephalous series Helpful Tips for Stupid Husbands.) I hope you this email finds you well. Are you having a nice Saturday? Doing any light reading? Translation: Mine is heavy because I am deep. I haven't done much today except for an awesome workout at the RSF this afternoon. Translation: My hard body is only getting harder. I didn't go to any parties last night after all, but mostly hung around with myself. Translation: Hanging around with myself is the favorite activity of people who know me. I'll probably study for awhile after I finish further introducing myself to you. Right now I'm listening to the Beastie Boys new instrumental album, The Mix-Up. It really Rocks. Translation: I am old school and German. I also just bought the new They Might Be Giants CD, The Else. I'll listen to that one later. Translation: Do not let my getting-harder-every-day hard body deceive you: I am indie. I had a nice time talking at you last night at dinner, over pizza, with a Coke. I thought I'd send you a quick email since I'm in a reflective mood right now. Translation: I just finished whacking it. I think I mentioned yesterday how much fun it looked like you had creating your MySpace profile. Translation: You are creative on the internet and I hope in bed too. Since I don't have one to share I guess I'll create one for you in this email, so you can learn a little bit about me. I hope you appreciate the effort I'm putting into this for you. Translation: I think you are special so please love me. I'll start off with 10 quick weird habits/random facts about myself because that is what people on MySpace do. 1. I consider myself to be an extremely private person. I guard my privacy. I rarely talk about myself anymore and I've stopped giving interviews. I prefer listening to other people. Translation: Don't let this revealing email I sent on the heels of our two minute-long conversation give you the wrong idea. Just because I asked around, learned your name, then found your MySpace page and am now bearing what I foolishly believe to be the most charming parts of my soul fool you: I am a private person.

My favorite genre of music is Rock, especially the Alternative from the early 90's, which I think is better and more Creative and awesome than the Rock from the late 60's. Translation: I sometimes suffer Fits of Being the German, but I am not a Person who likes the Scorpions, for while they are a Rock Band with their Guitars Soloing, they are not of the Alternative Movement which is the Movement of Music which pleases me mostly. 3.

I'll listen to that one later. </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>Do not let my getting-harder-every-day hard body deceive you: I am indie.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I had a nice time talking at you last night at dinner, over pizza, with a Coke. I
thought I'd send you a quick email since I'm in a reflective mood right
now. </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I just finished whacking it.</em></p></blockquote><p>I think I mentioned yesterday how much fun it looked like you had
creating your MySpace profile. </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>You are creative on the internet and I hope in bed too.</em></p></blockquote><p>Since I don't have one to share I guess
I'll create one for you in this email, so you can learn a little bit
about me. I hope you appreciate the effort I'm putting into this for
you.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I think you are special so please love me.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I'll start off with 10 quick weird habits/random facts about myself because that is what people on MySpace do.</p>

<p>1. I consider myself to be an extremely private person. I guard my
privacy. I rarely talk about myself anymore and I've stopped giving
interviews. I prefer listening to other people.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>Don't let this revealing email I sent on the heels of our two minute-long conversation give you the wrong idea.&nbsp; Just because I asked around, learned your name, then found your MySpace page and am now bearing what I foolishly believe to be the most charming parts of my soul fool you: I am a private person.&nbsp; I'll only share the video of our first time making love with my fifteen closest friends.&nbsp; </em></p></blockquote>

<p>2. My favorite genre of music is Rock, especially the Alternative
from the early 90's, which I think is better and more Creative and
awesome than the Rock from the late 60's.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I sometimes suffer Fits of Being the German, but I am not a Person who likes the Scorpions, for while they are a Rock Band with their Guitars Soloing, they are not of the Alternative Movement which is the Movement of Music which pleases me mostly.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>3. I once hung out at the pool at the Beverly Hilton with the
comedian Rodney Dangerfield, who is now dead.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I spoke to dead famous people.&nbsp; If for some reason your are not impressed, you should be.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>4. I had a short and volatile &quot;Hollywood-style&quot; marriage with a woman you would find attractive if you were a bisexual.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>My first wife left me but I am not bitter.&nbsp; For every year we are divorced, her tits sag another inch while my hard-and-getting-harder hard body only makes the inevitable threesome all the more likely.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>5. My first job after college was as a newspaper reporter.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I know how to misrepresent things, baby, I'm a former professional.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>6. I dropped out of high school as a junior and took the GED. I
transferred to Berkeley after two years of community college, all the
while having to work and put myself through school. It was a tough time but I am a strong man for it.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I am naturally brilliant and worked my way up from nothing because I am naturally brilliant.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>7. My closest friend for one year was Jill Stefani, Gwen Stefani's sister. I first heard <em>Tragic Kingdom</em> with Jill in April 1995, months before it came out. It already rocked then.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I once nailed a person who was on a <a href="http://www.nduniverse.com/nxd/ndfiles/gwen/gwen.html">video</a> on MTV.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>8. I once meditated for 8 hours straight for no particular reason.
My longest telephone conversation with a friend lasted 9 hours. </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I am so deep my depths take eight hours to plumb.&nbsp; Relatedly, nine hours of mere words cannot communicate my profundity.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>9. I once played $6-$12 Limit Hold Em' Poker in a casino for 12
hours straight. I was stuck in the game and could not recover my money.
I finally quit down -$1,500.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I will go down on you as long as it takes.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>10. I pride myself on accepting other people for who they are, and in being generally loving and
non-judgmental.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I mean &quot;being generally loving&quot; literally.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>11. I am Pisces, and left-handed.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I am random, hear me roar.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>12. My greatest fear is lonliness.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>Why are we not already having sex?</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Well, I'm from Fresno CA, in the Central Valley of California. My
heritage is Mexican-American. I am 6'2 and 240 pounds (of pure muscle).
You should have watched me worked the weights today as I was quite
impressive.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>Have I mentioned my hard-and-only-getting-harder hard body?&nbsp; </em></p></blockquote>

<p>General Interests are:</p>

<p>Food, especially Middle Eastern (Mediterranean) food. I also love Mexican food, especially anything made by my grandmother.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I am a lover of the exotic and my grandmother.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Gardening. I don't have my own land to garden at the moment, but I
can't wait to grow my own fruit trees and vegetables. Avocadoes, Plums,
Sunflowers, Chili's, Apricots, Oranges, Onions.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I believe restaurants grow on trees.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Music, especially David Bowie, Queen, Zeppelin, Sonic Youth, Nirvana,
Hole and Courtney Love. Pavement, Public Enemy, They Might Be Giants,
Blur, Beatles, and Soundgarden/Audiosalve.</p>

<p>My 10 favorite albums are:</p>

<p>1 Queen, <em>A Night At The Opera</em></p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I understand the gays.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Books: My academic interests cover a wide range of Philosophy,
Religion, Business, and Ethnic Studies. I think most people would find
my interests conflicting, but the reality is if you go deep enough
you'll find the various disciplines begin to merge together as one.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>Expect to see my magnum opus, <strong>The Seven Habits of Spiritual Brown Philosophers </strong>any day now.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>My BA from UC Berkeley is in Philosophy. My main areas of interests
are in contemporary Philosophy of Science, and Philosophy of Language.
I am fascinated with the developments in these two fields over the
course of the 20th century. Especially in seeing how philosophical
fashions moved from Logical Positivism to Postmodernism.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I paid attention one day in my Intro to Philosophy course and it's gonna get me laid.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I think the most important book of philosophy I've ever read is Ludwig Wittgenstein's <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>.
It is such a profound example of how language and its concepts shape
reality. His writing style is very unique. He was one of the first to
emphasize the importance of analysis. </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>He thought a lot, but he never hit it.&nbsp; I'm gonna hit it.&nbsp; With analysis.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I really enjoy some of the debates that have raged among Scientist
and Philosophers of Science. My favorite books in this area are Thomas
Kuhn's <em>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> and Paul Feyerabend's <em>Against Method</em>.
These philosophers
were both professors at Berkeley and have been great critics of science
as striving to describe an
objective truth about reality. They view science as a cultural art
form, or social construction. I took both undergrad classes and grad
level seminars at Berkeley from Elizabeth Lloyd, an evolutionary
biologist. She was brilliant and wonderful. I am deeply interested
these days in the Intelligent Design debate.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I can recognize a smart dame when I see one, and you are one, and hot to boot (and in them too).</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I am also very interested in Christian Theology. I became somewhat
spiritual a few years ago, after finishing my philosophy degree. I
completed one year of graduate level work at the Graduate Theological
Union in Berkeley. I studies Catholicism and spirituality. It was a
wonderful time in my life. I studied with Jesuit seminarians, the
liberal-left wing activist movement in the Catholic Church. I spent a
year working with the homeless, poor and oppressed. I studied the
writings of Thomas Aquinas and John of the Cross. I have a very broad
and liberal theological belief system. I am mostly inspired by the
Mystical aspects of Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. I also like Carl
Jung.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I am mystical with my skills.&nbsp; There is more to life than sex.&nbsp; There is also <strong>tantric </strong>sex.&nbsp; Plumb my depths, baby, you know how much I want to plumb yours.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I am Mexican-American, Chicano-Indigenous by heritage. Richard Rodriguez has been an inspiring writer to me. His books <em>Brown</em> and <em>The Education of Richard
Rodriguez</em>
have inspired me. He is the editor of New American Media websiteâan
alternative news media organization devoted to issues for various
ethnic groups. My dream is to write a novel about a very fascinating
Chicano icon whose story deserves to be told. If I get to know you
better, I might tell you about it.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I believe &quot;indigenous&quot; describes a race, and on the news, which I watch all the time, because I am educated, they talk about &quot;indigenous&quot; people the world over.&nbsp; I belong to the dominant race on the planet, sweetness.&nbsp; Make love to me.&nbsp; We can have beautiful indigenous children.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I also love Finance, and the markets. I am studying for level I of
the CFA exam right now. The Chartered Financial Analyst designation is
a very prestigious professional credential that will open many doors. I
really like the quantitative aspect to finance theory. It's not that
I'm greedy or need to wealthy. I'd like to work in Asset Management as
an Analyst. I would also be happy just to work as part of Corporate
Finance team doing Budgeting and Modeling. I will start an MS in
Finance in the fall. I also love trading and the gambling aspect. My
dream life includes Credit Spread trading of Options,
Currencies,Commodities, and more poker tournaments.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>Our indigenous children will never starve, because my depths are complemented by my shallows.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p></blockquote>

<p>I love movies: <em>Star Wars</em> is my favorite. I also like <em>Empire Strikes Back</em>, and <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, in that order. I also like Sylvester Stallone and the <em>Rocky</em>
series. I like all movies about Sports. My favorite director is Woody
Allen. My favorite actress is Jennifer Jason Leigh, I've seen all of
her films. I especially like her in <em>Dorothy Parker and the Vicious Circle</em> which is a film I think you will love. Winona Ryder is a close second.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>I am artsy, yet populist.&nbsp; If you mourn Bergman, do so in my arms.&nbsp; If you want to see <strong>Transformers</strong>, I will hold your popcorn.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Someone once asked me if I could change one thing about my life what
would it be? I thought about for a second and my response hasn't
changed today: I'd add beauty to it.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>Indigenous beauty.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>My ideal women is tall, with a wonderful smile. She is intuitive,
sensitive, and can make deep and lasting connections with people. She
understands how challenging it is to be a friend. Relationships are
very important to her, as is family. She wants to know herself as
deeply as possible and to see the big picture. She is mindful of her
True Self and nonjudgmental of others because she cares about a
person's humanity first before anything else.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>When I think of your True Self, I go all German.&nbsp; Work with me, baby, and our work will set you free.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Wow, I've written a lot. We can talk about more stuff like this,
&quot;the life struggle,&quot; later. I should go study or something right now. I
want to give you my phone number. [XXX-XXX-XXXX]. If you want to call
and invite me to Golden Gate Park tomorrow, that would
be great! I'm not doing anything. If not, I'll see you sometime next
week.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Translation: </strong>Call me and we can whack it together in the park.&nbsp; If not, I'll approach you again next week.&nbsp; Like a date.&nbsp; Exactly like a date.</em></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>The above is a slightly altered version of an email someone posted on Facebook sometime.&nbsp; I would be more specific, but I found it when I accidentally hit something which took me somewhere where I found this.&nbsp; I also learned that UCI has its own chapter of &quot;Freshmen Jews&nbsp; who like to PARTY.&quot;&nbsp; I neither wanted to learn that nor find this email.&nbsp; I wanted to browse at <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/quickstudy/">Scott McLemee</a>'s virtual bookshelf.&nbsp; Instead I find myself lamenting the <a href="http://istherenosininit.wordpress.com/2007/08/06/time-to-pack-it-in/">imminent departure</a> of A White Bear, who surely would've handled this material far better.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I don't know why I felt the need to annotate it, except I like <a href="http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/">Adam</a>, <a href="http://www.unfogged.com/">Ogged</a>, and <a href="http://waste.typepad.com/">Ben</a>, and I'm a &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Bros+Before+Hos%22">Bros before&nbsp; Hos</a>&quot; kind of guy.&nbsp; </p>

It&#39;s easily my third favorite Pavement album if you count <em>Watery, Domestic</em> as an album, my second if you don&#39;t.  I just lacks the looseness of Gary Young&#39;s drums.  <em>CR CR</em> is much more of a rock album than <em>SE</em>, and I liked that odd beast they were before they turned up the amps.  Put another way: &quot;Box Elder&quot; and &quot;Baptist Blacktick&quot; vie for the title of Scott&#39;s Favorite Pavement song, which tells you a little about the song I like.  <em>CR CR</em>&#39;s sloppy, but not tinny.  It roars where it should jingle.  </p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/the-self-correc.html"><span><strong>The Self-Correcting Blogosphere</strong> Two days ago, I told a story about having to have a toilet seat removed from my head by the jaws of life. I mentioned that the people who removed it knew my father, because he was also on the rescue squad. Two days later, the mysterious &quot;alkau&quot; fleshed out my story. Since this happened in Alberta, these firefighters didn't know my father. He was only a paramedic when we lived in New Jersey. I thought this happened in New Jersey. I must've been confusing this with the time the firefighters were called to my parents' house [eight] days after I was born ... when my dad was on call. Can you imagine that? There you are, playing cards with the other paramedics, and a call squawks in: &quot;Fire reported at [your address].&quot; I wasn't even a week old before my knack for getting myself into &quot;situations&quot; outed itself. Back to the topic at hand: I didn't lie when I implied this happened in New Jersey. Nor did the mysterious &quot;alkau&quot; lie when she said my head had been extricated by the jaws-of-life. But, as the equally mysterious &quot;jlkau&quot; informs us, she was mistaken. Seems trained rescue personnel would not use something with &quot;an incredible 195,126 lbs. of cutting force&quot; anywhere near the head of a small child unless he were trapped in the crushed hulk of a burning vehicle. This blog is now made of truth.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/08/signs-the-book-.html"><span><strong>Signs the Book You're Reading is a Revised Dissertation and/or Vintage '70s Fredric Jameson</strong> It is titled or subtitled The _____ Imagination. Its footnotes reference every single piece of secondary literature on a given subject. The distinction between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; literature relies not on any intrinsic feature of the work but on whether or not it was intended to be read by a disciplined bourgeois audience. Claude Levi-Strauss reminds its author to do many things, which he enumerates in grueling detail. Within the first two pages, the author trots out a classic of American Studies, like Constance Rourke's American Humor: A Study of National Character (1933), for the express purpose of bemoaning its naively undeconstructed use of oxymorons like &quot;acting naturally&quot; or &quot;realist performance.&quot; Peter Brooks' The Melodramatic Imagination is cited favorably before its argument suffers a violent death-by-uncharitable-rehearsal. The Algirdas Greimas Orchestra keeps you swinging in a semiotic square &quot;Early in the Morning &amp; Late at Nite.&quot; The author implores his readers to do their best 19th century German philologist and scrutinize comprehensively the entire historical record, from the fall of the Roman Empire to last week's raucous orgy in the penthouse of the Bellagio ... while presenting little evidence that he has done so himself.</span></a></div>
