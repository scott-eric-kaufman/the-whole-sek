First, the owner of the sore throat must contend with History. Both &quot;sore&quot; and &quot;throat&quot; originate in languages unpronouncable to anyone afflicted with a sore throat.

Linguists believe that this practice is the result of, well, the fact that unlike the members of the hearing community, the deaf have to learn to associate the phonemes on the page with the phonemes that they hear in order to reproduce them. When a hearing person learns to read, they associate the letters on the page with the sounds that they hear; when a deaf person learns to read, they associate the letters on the page with the hours and hours of endless toil in a speech therapy lab. I see the letters, but instead of hearing them inside my head I produce them, silently, with my mouth. I don't know why I do this, but it means that if I'm not careful I move my mouth and throat when I read and write. That folks is why writing with a sore throat hurts." />

What!?! Bands I listened to have been broken up for almost 15 years!?! But, but, but, these bands were awesome. My bands weren't like the crap bands all those older-than-dirt folks blather on and on and on about. My bands were awesome, I tell you, awesome. I suppose this isn't the best time to mention that while under the thrall of insomnia I watched unfold on the television the most accomplished cover of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; ever recorded. But I will anyway. That the Foo Fighters were the ones performing is beside the point. (I believe I can manage to alienate all members of my audience who aren't my immediate contemporaries in a single post. If you're three months older or younger than me, you no doubt have no idea what I'm talking about. But that's only because I'm infinitely cooler than you. I have the indie cred you bartered for and failed to land. I possess the banter you so pathetically imitate. That's right children: I'm the King of All Things Trivial, a latter-day Peter Pumpkinhead, if you will. Hooray for me!)</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/superadequate_s.html"><span><strong>Super-Adequate Structural Homologies, or The Ornithorynchus Shuffle</strong> Frank Sulloway titles his recent review of James Secord's Victorian Sensation: The Extraordinary Publication, Reception, and Secret Authorship of 'Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation with brazen inaccuracy: &quot;He Almost Scooped Darwin.&quot; In his response to my contribution to the Theory's Empire event, Sean McCann criticized the distinction I had made between Althusserian interpellation and Foucauldian discourse: [A]t some level the Althusserian account of the interpellation of the subject and the Foucauldian account (in Archaelogy) of its disappearance are in conflict. But the conflict isn’t really that deep, is it? What the two accounts share, of course, is a sense that autonomous personhood is wholly the illusory creation of larger, limiting structures...In other words, would it really be wrong for a latterday American academic to recognize an affinity here? As I noted in my response, Sean's right to say that with sufficient conceptual distance the Althusserian account of social determination resembles Foucault's. Much is lost in the acquisition of that distance. (And by much, I mean &quot;the premises.&quot;) Granted, McCann's operating in the tradition of the New Historicist, Benn Michaels Brigade. The NHBMB values structural homologies, and McCann's analysis pointed to the possibility of a structural homology between Althusserian and Foucauldian thought which would've belied the historical and personal animus between these two pillars of French post-structuralist thinking. I spent an unhealthy amount of time thinking about the Althusser/Foucault homology and I still don't know where I stand on it. But it's keyed me into the appearance of homologies of this ignore-the-premise-focus-on-the-conclusion sort. Hence my problem with Sulloway's title and the argument sitting pretty beneath it. To claim even titularly that Chambers' nearly scooped Darwin is to fundamentally misunderstand the significance of the theory of natural selection. Such a claim entails a cult of personality based first around the anonymous author (later revealed to be Chambers) of the Vestiges and later around Darwin (after the publication of the Origin). If Sulloway's argument held the water I think drowns it, this cult of personality would have to be founded on the principle that the public adored anyone who said &quot;Things Change!&quot; Because &quot;Things Change!&quot; is the extent of the connection between the intellectual content of Chambers' Vestiges and that of Darwin's Origin. (Don't take my word for it. Read the Vestiges yourself.) The most significant difference between Chambers and Darwin concerns the mechanism of evolution: Darwin had natural selection. Chambers had monstrous birth. He discusses the power of monstrous birth in Chapter 14 of the Vestiges. He first grants that the natural laws of reproduction demand that a mother of a given species give birth to a child of the same species. But what if man in his inability to be everywhere all the time has missed the occasional monstrous birth? Is it possible that every once in a while a goose gives birth to a mouse? According to Chambers, who cites as proof the work of Charles Babbage, we cannot disprove that no geese has ever given birth to...</span></a></div>
