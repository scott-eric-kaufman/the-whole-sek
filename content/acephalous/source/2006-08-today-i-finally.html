Before doing so, however, I want to update you on Festival of Self-Congratulation mentioned Saturday. It continues. New charges include &quot;plagiarizing things outright&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld impressions.&quot; It seems our dear Troll's unable to differentiate between quotation and plagiarism.

For her part, Colonel Moutarde has taken to chastizing The Valve for the way in which its contributors responded to Franco Moretti.

Questions like this are burdend with an implicit &quot;for the better.&quot; Some books really change you; however, they don't do so &quot;for the better.&quot; So I'm going to go with Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus.

Gravity's Rainbow and Ulysses I can count re-readings confidently because I can track my marginalia in the various editions littering the apartment.

<p><strong>1.&nbsp; One book that changed your life?</strong></p>

<p>Questions like this are burdend with an implicit &quot;for the better.&quot;&nbsp; Some books really change you; however, they don't do so &quot;for the better.&quot;&nbsp; So I'm going to go with Deleuze and Guattari's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0816612250/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Anti-Oedipus</em></a>.&nbsp; It ignited an already waxing interest in Theory—but that's not quite true.&nbsp; A combination of it and the explosively brilliant guy who taught the seminar on it, John Protevi, sent me scrambling.&nbsp; Then again, said scrambling contributed to my admission here, so I don't want to disown its impetus ... but I do sometimes wonder where and what I'd be if I'd never come to Irvine.&nbsp; (The answer, as previously noted, involves real estate.)</p>

<p>The other candidate for this one is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060931671/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Crying of Lot 49</em></a>.&nbsp; The story accompanyinig that answer is far too long to relate here.&nbsp; Needless to say it involves a student teacher I crushed hard on; a book I bought from her husband's used bookstore; my employment at said bookstore; the creation of a crude database of <em>Lot 49</em> and various other attempts to &quot;solve&quot; its mysteries; hitting on a new employee with talk of <em>Lot 49 </em>and the proper washing lettuce; and, finally, the wedding of the aforementioned new employee (charmed by talk of Pynchon and pesticide) and myself in which the man whose wife I'd crushed hard on stood beside me as my best man.&nbsp; See what I mean?&nbsp; <em>Complicated</em>.</p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp; One book you have read more than once?</strong></p>

<p>I like Kevin's answer, but I demur and go with simple addition.&nbsp; I've read <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140283382/diesekoschmar-20">Gravity's Rainbow</a> </em>eleven times, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679722769/diesekoschmar-20">Ulysses</a> </em>six, and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142437247/diesekoschmar-20">Moby Dick</a> </em>too many times to count.&nbsp; <em>Gravity's Rainbow </em>and <em>Ulysses </em>I can count re-readings confidently because I can track my marginalia in the various editions littering the apartment.&nbsp; <em>Moby Dick</em>, however, was my Christmas break conceit for the better part of two decades.&nbsp; I began with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1577656954/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Illustrated Classics</em></a>, but by sixth or seventh grade had worked myself up to book itself.&nbsp; Then it became a routine—and as anyone who knows me will tell you, I'm a creature of routine.&nbsp; <em>Nay!</em>&nbsp; I am The Creature of The Routine.&nbsp; For years I read it every winter break, sometime around <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/08/festivus_or_the.html">my birthday</a>.&nbsp; So much so, in fact, that three or four years ago I woke up one December 23<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>rd</sup></span> <em>shocked</em> to find that I had neither started nor planned on starting reading it. </p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp; One book you would want on a desert island?</strong></p>

<p><em>How to Get Off a Desert Island and Influence Sailors.&nbsp; </em></p>

<p><strong>4.&nbsp; One book that made you laugh?</strong></p>

<p>I could go with the old standby <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684833395/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Catch 22</em></a>, still the funniest book in the English language.&nbsp; Instead, I'll go with the one whose laughter-generating powers were the most unexpected: John McPhee's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374518734/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Annals of the Former World</em></a>.&nbsp; There are <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/10/geological_weir.html">passages</a>&nbsp; (scroll down) in that book that had me busting stitches no geological history of the United States has the right to bust.</p>





<p><strong>5.&nbsp; One book that made you cry?</strong></p>

<p>Tears of rage?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140431403/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Pamela</em></a>.&nbsp; I hated that book more than I've ever hated any book ever.&nbsp; <em>Ever.&nbsp; </em>As for the most recent, well then, that'd be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345459407/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Perdido Street Station</em></a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>6.&nbsp; One book you wish you had written?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/039332737X/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Will in the World</em></a>.&nbsp; Not because I'm fond of Shakespeare, mind you, but because the rare combination of a storyteller's gift with real critical chops Greenblatt displays therein.&nbsp; Most working academics possess the latter, but very few of us possess the former.&nbsp; (Or even seem to want to, now that I think about it.)</p>

<p><strong>7.&nbsp; One book you wish had never been written?</strong></p>

<p>I'd say <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393061159/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Ecrits</em></a>, but that's not a book so much as a series of essays.&nbsp; Had it not been for Lacan, I wouldn't have detoured three years of my graduate life so disastrously.&nbsp; As a cultural Jew, however, I should probably stick with the safe answer and say <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0395925037/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Mein Kampf</em></a>.&nbsp; (Which, it seems, is out of print.&nbsp; It may seem odd to mourn the fact that a book I wish had never been written is out of print, but surely it's read in history classes across the country?&nbsp; It's nothing if not important, after all.)</p>

<p><strong>8.&nbsp; One book you are currently reading?</strong></p>

<p>My turn to <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/07/curveball.html">throw a curve-ball</a>: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/032112880X/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Longman Anthology of British Literature, Volume Two</em></a>.&nbsp; Part of my scheme to forget even more canonical literature before I hit the market.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>9.&nbsp; One book you have been meaning to read?</strong></p>

<p>Accoring to my to-read pile, the top candidate is Cathy Davidson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195148231/diesekoschmar-20"><em>The Revolution and the Word</em></a>.&nbsp; I've read a chapter or two, thought them magnificant, and have been wanting to read the entire thing.</p>

<p><strong>10.&nbsp; Five people you want to tag?&nbsp; </strong>(<em>altered for symmetry</em>)</p>

<p>I always hate this part of memes, so I'll take the easy way out and tag anyone who wants to respond retroactively.&nbsp; Respond, send me a trackback and I'll doctor the historical record accordingly.&nbsp; That said, I'd love to hear from <a href="http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the_little_professor/">Miriam</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/">Timothy</a> and <a href="http://feministe.us/blog/">piny</a> on this one, if they have the time.&nbsp; </p>

		<span id="comment-21166390-content"><p>Well, I&#39;ve grown to like Freud as something...other than a psychoanalyst.  As for the <i>Wake</i>, it&#39;s difficult to say how many times I&#39;ve made it, since I&#39;ve frequently picked it up, read a few chapters, put it down, &amp;c.  Straight-through, however, only once.  All told?  Maybe four or five times.  (It&#39;s a puzzle for me, and I like puzzles.)  </p>

<p>Bryan, I blame that &quot;two&quot; on Sudafed, not deconstruction.  And of course I had to alter it.  The implicit question is &quot;Name X,&quot; so #10 originally said &quot;Name now tag five people.&quot;  I had a hard enough retaining the question marks, thinking that it must&#39;ve been started <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/ac_dc_derrida/#11027" rel="nofollow">by an Australian</a>.</p></span>

Had he not, I would've missed the following exchange between Our Infallible Colonel and her Brothers in Moral Perfection, Patrick Mullins and The Troll of Sorrow: LCC: Matt likes to start fights, it's his schtick, he had a habit early on of linking, pseudonymously often, at The Valve to other bloggers' posts there to draw abuse and draw the other bloggers, who have no patience for The Valve, which is really like reading I don't know what, high school student papers, into arguments there to defend themselves. PM: Oh, my God, this is all somewhat off-topic, but yes—very pimply ones with more verbosity per square inch than I've ever seen. Who could read a novel if they read 'The Valve?' They reduce all literature to labyrinthine horror and freeze-dried trends (when they can find them; they very often can't). TOS: [constantinated] The Valve, if you follow, is like very pimply high school student papers. I see only one solution available to such morally savvy folks: Drive down to your local pharmacy and buy the Valve some topical tetracycline. Return home and log on to the Valve. Before applying the medicine, thoroughly wash the affected area with warm water and soap, rinse well, and dry completely. Hack the medicine in half with a cleaver. Squeeze its contents into the palm of your hand and apply it to your monitor gratuitously. Be sure to apply it to the entire Internet, not just the affected area, as that will prevent new pimples from breaking out elsewhere. After applying this medicine, it is recommended you cover the treated area with a gauze dressing. Repeat this in the early morning and before bed, and in two to three weeks, your Valve will be as unblemished as you lot are supercilious.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/08/what_should_sco.html"><span><strong>What's Cooking?</strong> Now that this dreadful cold—somehow acquired in a crisp Southern California August—has loosened its thick fingers from my throat, I'm in the mood to blog again. Work, too. I spent today revising the chapter I'd planned on finishing before my unfortunate appointment with the ass-end of a felon's Honda Civic. (Despite not having been convicted, I can still call him a felon, as he committed the felony he would have been convicted of had the police been able to find him.) Not the heady intellectual waters I thought I'd have charted by now, but not nothing—quite a lot, actually, considering what's been thrown at me these past two years. All of which is mere preface to the meat of this post. Meat which, serial punster I am, is very much about meat. You see, back when I was in high school, I converted to ethical vegetarianism. Being the serious sort (and an athlete), I quickly decided my ethical vegetarianism needed to be taken to the next level. So I gave veganism 110% for the better part of two years. Were it not for a beautiful woman and a Louisiana concoction called a &quot;deep-fried 'grilled'-cheese sandwich&quot;—the irony is duly noted, but in the South, if it ain't boiled blisteringly spicy or deep-fried, it ain't fit for consumption—I might very well be the same annoyingly proselytizing gink I was then. Tainted by the power of cheese and general allure of dairy, eventually my ethical objections sloughed away and I considered eating meat again. Well, that and an article in The New England Journal of Medicine arguing that people who ate red meat and chicken but no fish developed Alzheimer's-like symptoms. I didn't eat red meat or chicken, but I also didn't eat fish, which meant that I'd start suffering from Alzheimer's-like symptoms any day now. I started eating fish. Even convinced a few other people to. (So maybe I'm not not the annoyingly proselytizing gink I was then.) Considering what 99.99% of the population ate, I was a god amongst nutritionists. Guzzling green tea, inhaling everything soy, eating fresh fish, working out four times a week—you know, the kind of guy everyone loves to loathe. Like Granny, I was positive I'd bought myself a couple extra decades on this mortal coil before anyone demanded I shuffle off ... then the test came back positive and it turned out I didn't. All those years of &quot;healthy&quot; living turned out not to be so healthy. How did I respond? I ditched vegetarianism. In stages. I began with a little chicken. Sharing a table with General Tso again was a life-altering experience. Still, it was months before I graduated to pork, and I have yet to matriculate in the School of Red Meat. (I tried a few weeks back but failed &quot;disastrously.&quot; That is a euphemism for what you think it is.) All of which brings me to tonight's quiz: What did Scott prepare for dinner tonight? A. Smothered Pork Chops B. Pan Fried Pork...</span></a></div>
