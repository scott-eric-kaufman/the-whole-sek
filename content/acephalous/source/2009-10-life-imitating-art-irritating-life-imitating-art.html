David has a sardonic, slightly depressive presence onscreen, and is
quite natural playing his worst self. Some of his finest moments are
when he gets into arguments—arguments that he always loses—with
children.</blockquote>In this week&#39;s episode, David accidentally
urinates on a picture of Jesus, the urine is mistaken for a tear, and
in the end, he manages to annoy and infuriate everyone around him. So
it goes ... or would have, had he not also managed to annoy and
infuriate conservatives who don&#39;t watch the show.

Near the end of Season 1, the episode about the incest survivor group had me laughing uncontrollably despite how uncomfortable the subject naturally was.  It  reminded me of Alan Alda strutting around Crimes and Misdemeanors saying &quot;If it bends...it&#39;s funny.  If it breaks...not funny.&quot;  By the time they got to the point at which the survivors were in group together, sharing their accounts of childhood horrors, I was thinking &quot;This has surely nearly broken by now, but it&#39;s still working.&quot;</p></span>

Add in the classical-column props at the convention and the Moses-like talk about the seas’ receding and the planet’s cooling, and I think this administration assumes we have a Holy Man in the White House. And when you consider the depiction of Fox News as heresy, Rush as the anti-Christ, and the NEA as the medieval church, it all gets, well, sort of creepy.The above, of course, is renowned military historian and classical scholar Victor Davis Hanson obliging the world. He leads with a Latin quotation so esoteric only people who have studied classical Latin oratory for decades seen Gladiator can recognize the import of its implied &quot;Ave Obama.&quot; Or not. Trotting out some of the only Latin his readers know means he needs a shoehorn to make his metaphor relevant: who are the &quot;saluting&quot; folks &quot;about to die&quot;? They are saluting Obama and are about to die for his entertainment, so they can't be Joe Lieberman and the rest of the Democratic Party, as that wouldn't entertain the President. They could be Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck and Newt Gingrich, but Victor Davis Hanson doesn't belong to the group of people currently enjoying that particular spectacle (that would be us). See, this is the problem with trotting out random bits of Latin in the service of a hopelessly muddled metaphor: you think you're impressing people who know more than you, when in truth you're only impressing people who don't know Latin. *cf lines 5 and 6</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/10/by-that-standard-were-all-already-everybody-else.html"><span><strong>By that standard, we're all already everybody else.</strong> I understand from all my email that Jack Cashill has posted another Obama/Ayers article. I wonder what non-tendentious conclusions he'll draw this time? Ayers and Obama both describe the crisis in the Chicago school system as &quot;perpetual.&quot; Ayers and Obama both complain about increasingly larger educational bureaucracies. Ayers and Obama both criticize the &quot;status quo.&quot; In short, the liberal politician and the liberal academics both air liberal grievances. For some reason, Cashill finds this compelling. The reason, of course, is that Cashill's not that bright. Need more proof? Ayers and a '60s radical in Obama's book both bitch about the Man. Ayers and a '60s radical in Obama's book both think education is a tool belonging to the Man. Cashill is actually shocked by the fact that Bill Ayers, a '60s radical, makes statements similar to those made by '60s radicals. He believes the fact that Bill Ayers, a '60s radical, and other '60s radical use the same language to be incriminating. He must be the only person to watch a Cheech and Chong movie sober and wonder, on account of them talking so similarly, whether they weren't actually the same person.</span></a></div>
