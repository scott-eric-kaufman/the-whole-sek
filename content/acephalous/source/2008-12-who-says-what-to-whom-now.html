The speech was a bust, and helped contribute to Dole’s loss to Bill Clinton… Helprin is right that many Democrats have been feckless. But if everyone from George W.

<blockquote><p>The pity is that the war could have been successful and
this equilibrium sustained had we struck immediately, preserving the
link with September 11th; had we disciplined our objective to forcing
upon regimes that nurture terrorism the choice of routing it out with
their ruthless secret services or suffering the destruction of the
means to power for which they live; had we husbanded our forces in the
highly developed military areas of northern Saudi Arabia after deposing
Saddam Hussein, where as a fleet in being they would suffer no
casualties and remain at the ready to reach Baghdad, Damascus, or
Riyadh in three days; and had we taken strong and effective measures
for our domestic protection while striving to stay within
constitutional limits and eloquently explaining the necessity—as has
always been the case in war—for sometimes exceeding them.</p></blockquote>
<p>The children <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTFhYzM0OGM0MjAyYTc0ZWUzMjljMDVhZDlmMzQzNzY=">on the </a><em><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTFhYzM0OGM0MjAyYTc0ZWUzMjljMDVhZDlmMzQzNzY=">Corner</a> </em>think otherwise.&#0160; According to Peter Wehner, Helprin’s editorial is both wrong <em>and </em>chock-full
of “very sloppy writing.”&#0160; The above soundly refutes the sloppiness
argument, but you should know better than to expect sound arguments
from people who think “Charles Krauthammer [is] America’s best
columnist and one of our finest geopolitical thinkers.”&#0160; My favorite
bits:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is an example of very sloppy writing on the part of <em>Helprin</em>…</p>
<p>I gather that <em>Helprin</em> is lamenting the fact that we did not
attack Iraq immediately after 9/11. &#0160;But we could barely attack
Afghanistan immediately after September 11, 2001, and Afghanistan
required a strategic innovation that <em>Halperin</em> totally ignores…</p>
<p>Reading between the lines, his use of the word “eloquently” probably translates into “we need more speeches written by Mark <em>Halperin</em>.” It’s worth recalling, then, that <em>Helprin</em>’s
most notable speechwriting achievement to date was penning Robert
Dole’s 1996 acceptance speech, arguing that Dole would be our Bridge to
the Past. The speech was a bust, and helped contribute to Dole’s loss
to Bill Clinton…</p>
<p><em>Helprin</em> is right that many Democrats have been feckless.
&#0160;But if everyone from George W. Bush to Democrats have been
feckless—and surely <em>Helprin</em> would throw in every other global ally on that spectrum, too—then <em>Halperin</em>
is saying everybody, but him, has got it wrong. This is akin to the man
on the highway who is going the wrong way and talks to his wife on the
phone about how many morons are going the wrong way.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inherent-Vice-Thomas-Pynchon/dp/1594202249/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229853691&sr=1-10" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Inherent-Vice-Thomas-Pynchon/dp/1594202249/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1229853691&amp;sr=1-10</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a small one -- 416 pages -- but hopefully it&#39;s better than *Against the Day*.</p></span>

Put differently: I didn&#39;t feel compelled to finish it.

<p><a href="http://www.hyperarts.com/thomas-pynchon/inherent-vice.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hyperarts.com/thomas-pynchon/inherent-vice.html</a></p>

<p><br />
It looks like a Jimmy Buffett album, and it sounds like a Tom Robbins novel.  </p>

<p>Adam, you make me want to re-read *Against the Day*.  My problem was this: it seemed like Pynchon writing a &quot;Pynchon&quot; novel.  I see this all the time with aging rock bands.  Take Sonic Youth.  They pioneered new sounds, they created a whole world of influenced bands (like Pavement), and then they started losing steam.  In reaction, they began doing &quot;Sonic Youth&quot; albums, rather than albums by Sonic Youth.</p>

<p>It has something to do with &quot;late style.&quot;  Novelists who want to have long careers can keep pushing their art (Henry James), or they can write the same novel again and again (Kurt Vonnegut), or they can decline (Faulkner), or they can try to rekindle the early flame (Pynchon).  With *Vineland* and *Mason &amp; Dixon*, I thought he was developing a late-ish style, something more humane than his early work, something elegiac almost.  But *Against the Day* seems like an attempt to re-do *Gravity&#39;s Rainbow*.  It seems underwritten, toneless at times, struggling to get the characters here and there rather than to develop them, full of functional sentences rather than Pynchon&#39;s heartbreaking and arch lines of *Mason &amp; Dixon*.  It&#39;s full of saying rather than showing: no dramatic approach, lots of summarizing narration.  Toni Morrison&#39;s recent novels suffer similarly, and it makes me wonder about the pressures of publishing contracts.  </p>

<p>My impression was that *Against the Day* needed another 500 pages and another few years to simmer.  </p></span>

Blackmur essay on Shakespeare’s sonnets with a group of twelve or so students.) TEACHER: Blackmur claims “the hues attract, draw, steal men’s eyes, but penetrate, discombobolate, amaze the souls or psyches of women.” What does he mean by that? CLASS: …? TEACHER: Break his sentence down. What does “discombobulate” mean? STUDENT #1: Bored? TEACHER: So Shakespeare’s language penetrates the souls of women by boring them? (two engineering majors giggle) How do you amaze someone by boring them? STUDENT #2: (confidently) It’s a technical term from Switzerland. Watchmakers call the tiny gears inside a watch “bobulates” (beaming) and what a watchmaker does is he brings the bobulates together, and “com” is the Latin for “together.” So the proper technical term for this watch here (points to his wrist), or any working watch, is to say it’s “combobulated.” But over the life of a watch, it gets knocked around, and the gears get unaligned, and when that happens the watch becomes “discombobulated.” TEACHER: Not “disbobulated”? STUDENT #2: That’s what I said, but he told me– TEACHER: He who? STUDENT #2: My rabbi. TEACHER: I see. STUDENT #2: He said the Swiss wouldn’t be taken seriously if they didn’t keep the Latin in there, because “bobulate” sounds silly enough without the Latin prefix. TEACHER: Isn’t “dis” a Latin prefix? STUDENT #2: I didn’t know that then. TEACHER: So what do you think Blackmur meant? STUDENT #2: …? I still don’t know what Blackmur meant—nor why my rabbi conspired with The Future to punk me—but as the MLA approaches, I’m increasingly convinced that the first time I ever spoke up in class foreshadowed some ominous end to my academic career.* So while I’m not exactly sure what end this start augurs, I take comfort in the fact that Dickens didn’t know what he’d foreshadowed for Pip when he wrote the first installment of Great Expectations.** (Or he wouldn’t have written two endings.) (x-stitched.) *The other lesson? Never trust the Jews. **Not that scholars have written much about this. The only exception I can think of is about Buffy—but that might be because I only dipped my toe in Dickensian waters. (Work on Wharton’s serialized novels focuses on how she altered the plot or how she mimicked James, so even though I should’ve encountered something about it researching my Wharton chapter, I didn’t.)</span></a></div>
