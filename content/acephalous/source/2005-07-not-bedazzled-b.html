So I'm pleasantly surprised that Marjorie Perloff's &quot;But Isn't the Same at Least the Same&quot; and David Schalkwyk's &quot;Wittgenstein's 'Imperfect Gardens'&quot; essays in The Literary Wittgenstein work according to logically incompatible assumptions. Perloff argues that Wittgenstein's language is translatable because it's concerned with language being translatable. Like Beckett, Wittgenstein's vocabulary consists of personal and demonstrative pronouns, ordinary verbs, basic nouns, and simple declarative sentences. The result is that his work, like Beckett's, can easily be translated. No controversies over the relative merit of the various translations of The Philosophical Investigations swirl because his quaint diction and calm style make the translator's job easy. Thus, Perloff concludes, Such language games will become increasingly prominent in an age of globalization where the availability of translation is taken for granted. Poets and fiction writers, I predict, will increasingly write in what we might call, keeping Wittgenstein's example in mind, a language of translatability. (52) There's no wrangling over the details and implications of Wittgenstein's work the way there is in the German translation of Robert Lowell's &quot;Skunk Hour.&quot; Here's the English: One dark night, my Tudor Ford climbed the hill's skull; I watched for love-cars. Lights turned down, they lay together, hull to hull, where the graveyard shelves on the twon... My mind's not right. Here's Perloff's analysis of it: [W]hat eludes [the translator, Manuel] Pfister is Lowell's particular tone. &quot;One dark night,&quot; for starters, has a fairy-tale quality (as in &quot;Once upon a time&quot;) that gives an ironic edge to the reference to St. John of the Cross's &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot;--a quality lost in the German In einer dunklen Nacht. In line 2, the pun on &quot;Tudor (&quot;two-door&quot;) Ford&quot; disappears even though Pfister retains the absurdly pretentious brand name. And his rendition of the third line is at once too specific and too long-winded: Lowell's casual &quot;I watched&quot; becames the emphatic ic hielt Ausshau, and Scheinwerfer ausgeschaltet (&quot;headlights turned off&quot;) does not allow for the resonance of &quot;lights&quot; or of &quot;turned down,&quot; which here connotes beds as well as the lights themselves.

Quoting Wittgenstein, she contends that his language has &quot;remained the same and keeps seducing us into asking the same questions&quot; because of its near-perfect translatability (43). Hammered home yet? Good. On to Schalkwyk, who begins his essay with a discussion of the untranslatability of Wittgenstein's prose: The statement that philosophy should be written as poetry appears in Culture and Value: Ich glaube meine Stellung zur Philosphie dadurch zusammengefast zu haben, indem ich sagte: Philosophie durfte man eigentlich nur dichten..." />

(35)</p></blockquote><p>She continues in this vein for another paragraph, but you see her point: that mode of analysis that <em>cannot</em> be done on Wittgenstein's writing.&nbsp; &quot;Wittgenstein's propositions are by means <em>untranslatable </em>in the sense that Lowell's &quot;Skunk Hour&quot; [is] untranslatable&quot; (36, emphasis hers).&nbsp; Quoting Wittgenstein, she contends that his language has &quot;remained the same and keeps seducing us into asking the same questions&quot; because of its near-perfect translatability (43).&nbsp; Hammered home yet?&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; On to Schalkwyk, who begins his essay with a discussion of the <em>untranslatability </em>of Wittgenstein's prose:</p><blockquote><p>The statement that philosophy should be written as poetry appears in <em>Culture and Value</em>: Ich glaube meine Stellung zur Philosphie dadurch zusammengefast zu haben, indem ich sagte: Philosophie durfte man eigentlich nur <em>dichten</em> (<em>CV </em>24).&nbsp; Peter Winch translates this as: &quot;I think I summed up my attitude to philosophy when I said: philosophy ought really to be written as a form of <em>poetic composition</em>.&quot;&nbsp; But his formulation doesn't quite convey the sense of the original.&nbsp; This is not the translator's fault, because English has no equivalent for the word <em>dichten</em>--an intransitive verb meaning to write poetry.&nbsp; Wittgenstein is saying ... that the <em>activities </em>of writing philosophy and writing poetry are closely related: to philosophize is to poetize--one should write philosophy only (&quot;<em>nur</em>&quot;) as one would write poetry; philosophy should be nothing other than the writing of poetry.</p></blockquote><p>I'm reserving judgment on whether I prefer Perloff or Schalkwyk's account of Wittgenstein until I finish the volume and work through the <em>Philosophical Investigations </em>on my own--Dissertation?&nbsp; What dissertation?--but what I want to stress for now is that juxtaposing these essays in the manner that Gibson and Huemer (the collection's editor) have focuses readers' attentions on the terms of the debates and the conflicting assumptions even sophisticated readers of Wittgenstein bring to his work.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This focusing is exactly what's absent from conventional Theory anthologies: Freud is presented alone instead of alongside critics.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Later psychoanalytic thinkers who tinker with Freud's work don't count as &quot;critics&quot; since they assume the validity of core psychoanalytic concepts.)&nbsp; Thus far <em>The Literary Wittgenstein </em>performs the function of introducing me to the concepts in a critical framework which precludes the uncritical acceptance encouraged by Theory anthologies.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And I just wanted to say that.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Because I don't want to be thought a Negative Nancy.</p>

<p>Even though that would be a fair description.&nbsp; (Well-deserved even.)</p>

Obviously this is none of my business, and I apologize for the brash tone of this post.  But I am both fascinated and awestruck by your seemingly Herculean work ethic.  I too will soon be chest deep in a swamp of seminars and papers and financial aid checks and deadlines and all else that a doctoral program in English Lit entails.  And I am just curious as to how you manage.  Is there even a smidgeon of time in your day for good ole procrastination?  For if not, I am almost certainly doomed.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-7628120-content"><p>Mike, first I should say that it <i>always</i> looks like the person to your left has four or five more hours in their day than you do in yours.  Everyone marvels at everyone else&#39;s work ethic.  However, I <i>do</i> procrastinate productively.  For instance, answering your comment has me thinking about my work ethic, which may become a future post.  Or another: I read <i>The Literary Wittgenstein</i> when I&#39;m struggling with my dissertation; a couple of hours doing unrelated intellectual labor often primes me to dissertate some more.  Same thing with the blog.  As I mentioned a while back, the progress I&#39;ve made on my dissertation on a given day is coded into that day&#39;s entry: if it&#39;s about evolutionary theory, then you can pretty sure that I&#39;m trying to jump-start my brain, to wrap it around the problems I&#39;ve encountered that day, which means I haven&#39;t made much progress on the diss.; if it&#39;s random, then I&#39;ve probably had an excellent day writing, so much so that I&#39;m comfortable putting the diss. down for the night and thinking about something else entirely.  </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t hurt that the Little Womedievalist&#39;s also an academic <i>and</i> that we bring out the worst in each other in this respect.  As long as one of us imagines the other&#39;s still working, we push ourselves to do the same.  That we work in different rooms helps maintain the illusion of the other&#39;s productivity, and that drives us both to be more productive than we might otherwise be.  </p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t attend classes anymore.  I&#39;m A.B.D. and haven&#39;t sat in a seminar room in years.  (I tried to this past Winter quarter, but that pesky cancer killed those plans.)  I teach three times a week during the school year, but it&#39;s nto the brain-drain that comp. sometimes becomes, it&#39;s an intro. to literary journalism course in which we read <i>New Yorker</i>-style articles, learn &#39;em some basic research and reporting skills, then help them write their own <i>New Yorker</i>-style article.  </p>

<p>Oh, and I&#39;m very, <i>very</i> boring.  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-7628891-content"><p>Thanks for the response, Scott.  Productive procrasitnation is a habit I&#39;ve yet to develop.  I suppose I&#39;m just going through a bit of &quot;am I really up to this?&quot;  Your academic background is, I can&#39;t help but notice, just a wee bit prolific, vastly more so than my own.  Honors undergraduate program?  Rigorous Latin studies?  A.B.D. at one of the nation&#39;s most respected English departments?  You&#39;ve done pretty well for yourself.  Not to mention the fact you&#39;ve been married for how many years is it, 5, 6?  Anyway, I&#39;ll stop making you blush if you get to work on that work ethic post.  It would be helpful to me to know what sort of regimen you maintain.  Which year of grad school was the hardest for you?  Why do you feel you&#39;ve &quot;conned&quot; your way through the first few years?  I look forward to hearing your thoughts.  Feel free to digress with reckless abandon.</p></span>

You really should. You can't spend your entire life laughing at everybody else. Sometimes it's healthy to realize how shallow your depths once were.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/07/me_im_the_last_.html"><span><strong>Me?  I'm the Last Person You Ought to Respect!</strong> In the comments to the previous post, Mike S. asked how do you find the time to (a) read and (modestly) review sizable literary anthologies, (b) remain (somewhat) hard at work on that curious dissertation of yours, (c) sift through God knows how many highfalutin weblogs, (d) attend classes, and (e) lavish your wife with attention? My initial response employed the truism that it always seems like the person to your immediate left has four of five more hours in the their day than you do in yours. (That's right, Holbo, I'm looking at you.) The more I thought about it the more I understood that I do have quite the work ethic, but here's the thing: I've cultivated it in such a way that it doesn't feel like a work ethic so much as a life. I spend probably 14 hours a day--and now that summer's here, I spend almost 14 hours every day--either sitting at my desk writing or reading online or with my desk chair swivelled around and my feet propped up on the bed reading books, journals, magazines, &amp;c. When I confess to Mike that I'm a very boring person, well, I'm not kidding. I'm a veritable shut-in, the kind of person who wakes up one morning and realizes that the sexy stubble he'd created with his beard trimmer what seemed like just yesterday has become quite the manly beard, complete with chops. (I am, however, a shut-in of the bathing variety. I bathe every single day and brush my teeth at least three times per diem. And according to a self-selecting group of former students, even my minimalist approach to grooming's enough to keep my &quot;hotness quotient&quot; hovering around 71.49 percent. But I digress.) So one answer to Mike's question is that my possibly pathological fear of leaving the apartment improves the quality of my scholarship. I'll return to my actual work habits momentarily, but first I want to address some of the other issues Mike raises: Your academic background is, I can't help but notice, just a wee bit prolific, vastly more so than my own. Honors undergraduate program? Rigorous Latin studies? A.B.D. at one of the nation's most respected English departments? You've done pretty well for yourself. Not to mention the fact you've been married for how many years is it, 5, 6? All I can say to this is that it's very easy to make the accomplishments of others look planned. But a little &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; look at my academic career will demonstrate that much of what seems planned or earned is actually the result of circumstances I never could have anticipated. I'll take this compliment-by-compliment: Mike mentions that I'm an Honors Scholar, i.e. that all of my introductory classes at LSU were taught by Honors professors in the Honors College. What Mike doesn't realize is that my being in the Honors College was a complete fluke. I've mentioned before that one thing people would never guess about me is that I graduated...</span></a></div>
