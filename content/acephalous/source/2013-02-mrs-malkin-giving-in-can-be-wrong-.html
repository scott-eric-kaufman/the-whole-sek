It was a horrifying dream made all the worse by the fact <em>that it was a memory</em>. My camp counselors forced me to belt out songs from the <em>Rocky IV </em>soundtrack because, I assume, they are terrible human specimens.
</p>
<p>Just the worst.
</p>
<p>But as humiliating as it is to admit to having been some failed lifeguard&#39;s dancing monkey, I take comfort in knowing that I didn&#39;t <em>choose</em> to sing that song or the Diet Coke jingle that preceded it: a seventeen-year-old man-child made me do it because of something he mistook for &quot;reasons.&quot;
All of which is only to say that Michelle Malkin&#39;s parents need to sue whatever camp they sent her to <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2013/02/24/parody-video-evolution-of-liberal-dance/">for this</a>:

I mean, her counselors even made her title it a &quot;parody video,&quot; like they knew how few mad props and scrip dividends her version of &quot;Raise of the Roof&quot; would&#39;ve netted at the next PTA meeting sans the signposting.

A few years ago I wrote of my hatred of the flat affect (or affected flatness) that characterizes Delillo‚Äôs prose, and I‚Äôm going to be making a similar argument about Mendes. I can make that argument directly, in that both blame the postmodern condition for the flattening and both think that finding meaning in meaninglessness is the proper aesthetic response to it. To wit: To understand all this. To penetrate this secret. The mountain was here, unconcealed, but no one saw it or thought about it, no one knew it existed except the engineers ‚Ä¶ a unique cultural deposit ‚Ä¶ and he saw himself for the first time as a member of an esoteric order, they were adepts and seers, crafting the future, the city planners, the waste managers, the compost technicians, the landscapers who would build hanging gardens here, make a park one day out of every kind of used and eroded object of desire. To understand Delillo. To penetrate his secret. The appeal is there, everyone sees it when they think about it, everyone knows it is ‚Äúa unique cultural deposit,‚Äù taken by Delillo on the chest of Americans who want to believe they belong to an esoteric order, that they are the adepts and seers of literature. Only they aren‚Äôt. They read a big book full of moments, as above, in which characters look at ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù and are struck by an epiphanic bolt named ‚Äúrecycling.‚Äù Don Delillo writes ‚Äúdeep‚Äù thoughts for stupid people. Mendes traffics in similar crap: I don‚Äôt care if it could be mistaken for a two-shot of people in a museum, that thing they‚Äôre looking at is still a plastic bag, not a reminder that everything is connected. Or if it is a reminder that everything‚Äôs connected we‚Äôre back to the profundity that it is modern recycling. It‚Äôs not evidence that there‚Äôs ‚Äúthis entire life behind things, and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know that there was no reason to be afraid.‚Äù It‚Äôs not an ontological proof of the existence of a non-denominational Kindness that communicates through gusts of trash. It‚Äôs a fucking plastic bag. But it gets worse. It‚Äôs a plastic bag ‚Äúthat was just, dancing with [Ricky], like a little kid begging [for him] to play with it‚Äîfor fifteen minutes,‚Äù meaning that it‚Äôs a plastic bag that Ricky didn‚Äôt recycle. He befriended it in the name of the non-denominational Kindness who speaks through trash and filmed the encounter so we all could meet said Kindness through Art. It‚Äôs first-order Art in the film, when Ricky shows it to Jane, but it‚Äôs second-order Art when Mendes presents us Ricky showing it to Jane, so we experience their experience of Art because in the postmodern world one can never experience The Thing Itself only mediated versions of It through Art. This is a...</span></a></div>
