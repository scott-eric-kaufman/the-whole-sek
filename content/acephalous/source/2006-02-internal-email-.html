        <meta name="description" content="The following is an email The Acephalous Sun recently acquired: Dear SmartPodiums &quot;Я&quot; Us: We here at the Instructional Resource Center would like you to modify the Model-T51789 SmartPodium previously installed in HIB 110. The specific alterations we request are: When an instructor presses the &quot;up&quot; button on podium touchscreen the cursor should move down and when &quot;down&quot; is pressed it should move up. Similarly when the instructor presses &quot;right&quot; the cursor should move left and when &quot;left&quot; is pressed it should move right. Every time an instructor touches the touchscreen it should emit a shrill &quot;beep&quot; to inform the students that their instructor has touched it. If possible we would like it to randomly emit multiple beeps despite being touched only once. That &quot;beep&quot; should not correllate to the cursor moving in the opposite of the desired direction. The cursor should only move when it wants to. But the SmartPodium should beep everytime the instructor touches it. And sometimes when he doesn't. We also request a camera with video capability be secreted in or next to the touchscreen. It should be programmed to record whenever the touchscreen is activated. Once completed the SmartPodium should automatically email the recorded video to the email addresses specified in previous correspondence. We hope these modifications can be completed before 16 February 2006. Thank you again for your willingness to go the extra mile for the IRC. P.S. If you would like your email added to the aforementioned mailing list we'd be more than happy to oblige. Watching these idiots cajole then threaten your quality podiums is all the meaning we can muster from our tiny little lives." />

		<span id="comment-14057015-content"><p>&quot;Turn the cursor upside down&quot;?  How would I do that?  The cursor on the flatscreen before me moves like a cursor oughta.  The cursor on the big screen, however, doesn&#39;t.  I&#39;m hip with flashing button changes.  After all, I&#39;ve been known to play the occasional SNES game on this here laptop . . . but I don&#39;t see why I should have to do that on a SmartPodium.  </p>

<p>Shouldn&#39;t they assume their clients are computer-illiterate?  Even if they don&#39;t, you know, even if they assume they ain&#39;t savvy—which I am, <i>stop laughing</i>, I&#39;ve kept two laptops and three desktops running smoothly for five years, and that&#39;s no small accomplishment—shouldn&#39;t they at least make these things user-friendly?  Isn&#39;t it their job to make these matters intuitive?  <i>Or at the very least not counter-intuitive</i>?  Not that I&#39;m attacking you, brother, but seriously, I don&#39;t think IRC ought to program their &quot;Smart&quot;Podiums to work so . . . unsmartly, no?</p></span>

<p>And yet....</p>

<p>There is a ten-minute delay on the time it takes the classroom computer to go on &quot;standby,&quot; so you get to sit in front of the class, much like Patton, with a projector light in your eyes and an enormous image of Jon Stewart behind you.  </p>

(Groan.)</strong> Few would dispute the claim that Michael Herr's Dispatches stands somewhere near the summit of journalistic achievement. You have your Capote boosters , your Mitchell partisans and your rabid Joan Didion fans . . . but even they would admit that while Herr lacks their beloved's body of work, Dispatches alone earns Herr the right to be mentioned in the same breath. Unless you ask Herr, who now insists that Dispatches is a novel with all the trappings one expects from fiction in which the author writes &quot;what he knows.&quot; The vivid characters are composites, the dramatic moments were invented &amp;c. I'm tempted to dismiss his claims to having invented these characters as part of what had been (before the memoir craze of recent years) a structural bias against the literariness of literary journalists, the best of whom only filter the brilliance of others. Who wants to filter genius? More to the point: Who can't? Anyone can filter. Only geniuses are geniuses. Such seems the reasoning behind Herr's '80s argument and his subsequent struggle to have Dispatches declared fiction. I don't buy it. My main objection is that it dehumanizes the grunts he lived with in Vietnam. My secondary one is that it suggests that Vietnam couldn't do to kids what everyone knows it did. Some of the more sensational scenes in Dispatches do seem invented . . . but so do commonplace accounts of daily life during the Vietnam War. In short: Herr wants credit for what historical context created. I don't want to give it to him. At least not for Dispatches. But I'll give it up for Full Metal Jacket . &quot;Wasn't Full Metal Jacket was based on Gustav Hasford's The Short-Timers?&quot; I admit: The first half of the fim was lifted verbatim from &quot;The Spirit of the Bayonet&quot; section. But the second half of the film contains numerous reworkings of material from Dispatches and, more importantly, doesn't end with Cowboy's death like &quot;Grunts&quot; did. The novel concludes with Joker killing Cowboy after he's been mortally injured by a sniper. Then they return to base. In the film the Lusthog squad tracks down the sniper. Rafterman shoots her down . . . but let me step back and let the ironies compound. In the screenplay for the film Herr creates a composite of Hasford's &quot;Joker&quot; and Michael-Herr-working-journalist-in-Vietnam. Hasford's Joker is a combat correspondent like Herr . . . only Joker went through BT and is actually a Marine. Herr was a combat correspondent for Esquire. But when Herr adapted Hasford's novel he had Joker experience much of what Herr did and wrote about in Dispatches. He grafted Dispatches onto The Short-Timers. Thus we see Dispatches' most memorable dialogue crop up in Full Metal Jacket. To wit: DOORGUNNER: Anyone who runs is a V.C. Anyone who stands still is a well-disciplined V.C. You guys oughtta do a story about me sometime. JOKER: Why should we do a story about you? DOORGUNNER: 'Cause I'm so fucking good! That ain't...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/the_kids_papers.html"><span><strong>&quot;The Kids' Papers&quot;</strong> I woke up this morning with an idea in my skull. I'd dreamed I was sitting on a bench, in Baltimore, facing the tumbling fountain in Harlem Park, beside a woman who wore a veil. I had come there with her. She was somebody I knew well. But I had suddenly forgotten who she was. I asked her if she had finished grading the papers. She answered me, but the roar and swish of the tumbling fountain smothered her voice, and I could hear nothing. The dream ended there. I walked into the kitchen, opened the top of the refigerator and attacked the ice tray. The girl stood in the doorway and asked questions. I didn't answer them while I put ice, lemon juice and seltzer together in two glasses. I put my glass on the table, sat down facing it, and complained. She reached across the table and patted my hand. Her eyes were uneasy. She smiled too softly and spoke too indulgently: &quot;You exaggerate so, honey. Those kids deserve all they get.&quot; I grinned, picked up the glasses, and went out to the kitchen for more seltzer. When I came back she frowned at me over anxious dark eyes and said: &quot;The trouble with you is your nerves are shot. You've been through too many papers in the last few days. Keep it up and you're going to have a nervous breakdown.&quot; I held up a hand with spread fingers. It was steady enough. She looked at it and said: &quot;That doesn't mean anything. It's inside you. Why don't you sneak off for a couple of days' rest?&quot; &quot;Can't sister. Somebody's got to stay here and grade the papers.&quot; Her eyes got large and then narrowd to black-fringed slits. She leaned toward me, upsetting her glass with an elbow: &quot;Then let's talk scratch.&quot; I grinned at the greed in her eyes and said: &quot;Not just yet. We'll have to see how you work out before we start scattering pennies around.&quot; She called me a damned nickle-nurser. I grinned and handed her a paper from the stack. She pretended it took her nearly five minutes to read the fifteen hundred words the kid had written. I gave her my fountain pen and held a notebook under the paper, to stiffen it while she scribbled her comments at the bottom, and to have it in my hands as soon as she had finished. I looked it over and said: &quot;You can't tell some kid that. Where were you raised?&quot; &quot;I was raised in a convent,&quot; she told me. &quot;I won the good behavior prize every year I was there. I thought little girls who put extra spoons of sugar in their chocolate went to hell for gluttony. I didn't even know there was such a thing as profanity until I was eighteen. The first time I heard any I damn near fainted.&quot; She let me look her over, having all sorts of confidence in her belief that, like a lot...</span></a></div>
