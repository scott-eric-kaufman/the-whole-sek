        <meta name="description" content="(This being another one of those visual rhetoric posts.) At this point my point should be staring you in the face: the mid-season finale of Breaking Bad is all about staring and what it means to stare. Staring can signify the acquisition of knowledge (the fly and the painting) or suggest intimacy (the cafe) or indicate an experience with the ineffable (the money pile). That it functions so differently in a single episode prevents the audience from being able to predict how a particular stare will influence the narrative. (Unlike a stare in a generic gangster film, for example, which the audience can safely assume will lead to the death of the person being stared at or being thought about while the staring occurs.) This is why the final scene in the episode works so well: its simplicity. But before I get to that, I should set up the narrative at this particular moment. Walter and his extended family, including his DEA-employed brother-in-law Hank, are having a dinner beside the White's pool. It's worth noting that this is a significant pool: Walter spent the time in which Mike's men were being murdered alternating between staring at it and his watch: Given that the palette of Walter's depravity skews as blue as his meth, it's not surprising that the face of his watch is blue. Nor is it surprising that after he learns that the synchronized hits went down successfully, MacLaren returns to the &quot;scene&quot; of the crime and shots Walter thus: There's bad Walter bathed in blue and staring at the pool. He knows he's crossed a line: it was one thing to murder Fring or Mike in what he could justify to himself as self-defense. It's another entirely to remove Mike's crew from the world because their continued existence posed a potential threat to his empire. He's cooked for three consecutive months and only could have done so by taking out Mike's men. (Otherwise one of them would've talked and Walter would've been arrested.) As he sits by the side of his pool, ignorant of the exact amount of money he's earned during his months long cooking binge, the serene look on his face may come from an exhausted sense of pride in work well-done, but it also hides the fact that he knows that work couldn't have been done had he not arranged the murders of Mike's men. The ends have justified his means. Then he's introduced to the money pile, the experience of which so muddles his immoral calculus and leads to him informing Skyler that he's retiring from the trade and bringing his family back into the fold. Which is only to say that regardless of Walter's state of mind prior to meeting the money pile, its existence alters him in such a way that he believes himself capable of recapturing the life he's lost. The penultimate scene next to the pool is the first step in resumption of normalcy. His wife and children have returned..." />

Nor is it surprising that after he learns that the synchronized hits went down successfully, MacLaren returns to the &quot;scene&quot; of the crime and shots Walter thus:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c1155aa970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Breaking bad00143" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c1155aa970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c1155aa970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00143" /></a><br />There&#39;s bad Walter bathed in blue and staring at the pool. He knows he&#39;s crossed a line: it was one thing to murder Fring or Mike in what he could justify to himself as self-defense. It&#39;s another entirely to remove Mike&#39;s crew from the world because their continued existence posed a potential threat to his empire. He&#39;s cooked for three consecutive months and only could have done so by 
taking out Mike&#39;s men. (Otherwise one of them would&#39;ve talked and Walter
 would&#39;ve been arrested.) As he sits by the side of his pool, ignorant 
of the exact amount of money he&#39;s earned during his months long cooking 
binge, the serene look on his face may come from an exhausted sense of 
pride in work well-done, but it also hides the fact that he knows that 
work couldn&#39;t have been done had he not arranged the murders of Mike&#39;s 
men. The ends have justified his means. Then he&#39;s introduced to the money 
pile, the experience of which so muddles his immoral calculus and leads  to
 him informing Skyler that he&#39;s retiring from the trade and bringing  
his family back into the fold. Which is only to say that regardless of 
Walter&#39;s state of mind prior to meeting the money pile, its existence 
alters him in such a way that he believes himself capable of recapturing
 the life he&#39;s lost.</p>
<p>The penultimate scene next to the pool is the first step in resumption of normalcy. His wife and children have returned home. His sister- and brother-in-law have come over for dinner. Everything is right in the universe. The river&#39;s flowing:</p>

For the first time in what feels like seasons, when Walter looks at Skyler, she responds not by <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/08/realism-and-bad-manners-in-breaking-bad" target="_self">talking to her wine</a> or <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/08/breaking-bad-say-my-name-or-fine-maybe-dont-even-acknowledge-i-exist" target="_self">simply walking away</a>, but with a smile that signifies, if not happiness, at least acceptance of the fact that she might one day be happy again:</p>

He&#39;s forsaken the trade and resumed living what he thinks of as &quot;his life.&quot; Which makes it all the more tragic when Hank needs to use the restroom, can&#39;t find any suitable reading material and settles for some poetry:</p>

<p>Which of course is Whitman&#39;s <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Note though that he doesn&#39;t stare at the volume intently in order to fathom the connections it might represent. He idly thumbs through the pages:</p>

The fact that the camera reverses from a low-angle shot of Hank on the can to a high-angle shot of what Hank&#39;s reading on the can is significant only inasmuch as it seems unwarranted. Something&#39;s happening here, but it&#39;s not happening <em>in </em>Hank&#39;s head so much as it is <em>to </em>it. Hank&#39;s being prodded to remember something:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31e32f71970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Breaking bad00173" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31e32f71970b" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c31e32f71970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00173" /></a><br />But unlike Walter—who was shot staring at the painting until he made the connection becacuse he had to work for it, it couldn&#39;t be conveniently given to him in the form of the flashback—MacLaren&#39;s active camera suggests that something unintended and inadvertent is happening to Hank here, and sure enough, she provides him with a flashback:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c117582970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Breaking bad00176" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c117582970c" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3c117582970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00176" /></a><br />

In the first frame above, Walter convinces Hank that Boetticher&#39;s notes indicate that he couldn&#39;t have been Heisenberg. In the second frame, Hank jokes that &quot;W.W.&quot; could stand for &quot;Walter White&quot; instead of &quot;Walt Whitman,&quot; to which Walter responds:</p>

They&#39;re within each other&#39;s personal space, and Walter&#39;s confessing, albeit humorously, to being the meth kingpin he actually is. Hank laughed it off when it happened, but when he&#39;s presented with the flashback, he feels all the more betrayed by the revelation that Walter actually is Heisenberg:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744c0e296970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Breaking bad00183" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c2df453ef017744c0e296970d" src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017744c0e296970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Breaking bad00183" /></a><br />And he does so in another doubly intimate moment: it&#39;s an extreme close-up <em>and </em>he&#39;s on Walter&#39;s toilet. So what does he do? <em>He stares at himself in the vanity mirror and sees a dupe with the truth in his hands and his pants around his ankles</em>. The episode&#39;s final irony is that for all the revelations and connections that were drawn and communicated through staring, everything that just came back together is going to fall apart because Hank just happened to glance at something. Hank got lucky, or Walter became sloppy, but what this final moment demonstrates is that whereas Walter needs to stare because he needs to be certain 100 percent of the time to maintain his secret, Hank only has to half-notice one thing and half-remember another in order to expose it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t recall -- did you have a look at the scene from a few episodes ago where Skyler walks into the pool? (S&#39;pose I could look myself.) Blue pool, she&#39;s wearing a blue skirt and white top, and she submerges herself in that blue water. Seemed like a pretty significant moment: blue (meth) underneath her, white (Walter) on top, and she&#39;s consigned herself to diving into Walter White&#39;s blue world. </p>

<p>The green filter also stands out (again I s&#39;pose I could go look to see if you already wrote on this), and it&#39;s more prominent in the cooking scenes. Not sure if it&#39;s as simple as green for cash, or if they&#39;re going for a kind of &quot;sick&quot; vibe, like Fincher does with the house scenes in Fight Club. (Or maybe both.)</p>

<p>And with the green, you have the stack of cash on top of a red tarp, right after the synchronized assassinations and the steady shots of red blood pooling on the prison floor. </p>

<p>Is it just me, or did the synchronized assassinations recall something of the baptism montage from The Godfather? Beyond just the synchronized murders, there&#39;s the significance of water at the center of both montages.  </p></span>

In both montages, the scenes mark the point where the protagonists consolidate their power and take the final step over the moral line into the world of organized crime lord. </p>

<p>By making Breaking Bad&#39;s synchronized assassinations recall Godfather&#39;s baptism montage, Gilligan/MacLaren are linking their narrative to a cinematic gangster film tradition of the (anti) hero&#39;s metamorphosis into a position of power. </p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2012/09/breaking-bad-white-savior.html"><span><strong>Walter White is no White Savior</strong> Malcolm Harris is convinced that Breaking Bad‘s Walter White is yet another example of the White Savior, i.e. The white guy who enters a world supposedly beneath him where he doesn’t belong yet nonetheless triumphs over the inhabitants is older than talkies. TV Tropes calls it “Mighty Whitey,” and examples range from Tom Cruise as Samurai and Daniel Day Lewis as Mohican[.] I’m not one to cut Dances-with-Braveheart-Smurf slack, as I abhor little more than the notion that a white mind triumphs over brown bodies, but in this case I think Harris’ criticism is misguided. Lindsay more than adequately addresses Harris’ concern with the “purity” of Walter’s product, so I’ll focus on the simple fact that Harris doesn’t understand the trope he thinks is operative here. He seems to believe that any time a white person succeeds in a predominantly non-white discipline, said person automatically qualifies for the title of White Savior. But the examples he provides—The Last Samurai and Last of the Mohicans—indicate that on some level he’s aware that this trope traditionally involves more than a white man out-doing his non-white competitors in whatever it is they’re doing. It involves a white man teaching non-white people how to be the best non-white people they can be by leading them into battle as only a white man can. There’s typically a cultural synergy—the white man embodies the “best” traits of whites and non-whites—that enables the White Savior to lead his primitative horde to victory. The problem with claiming this trope to be operative in Breaking Bad isn’t just that there’s no cultural synergy, nor is it just that Walter cares little for the fate of the non-white people his work displaces. Walter cuts a culturally unique figure: he’s a typical white imperialist, a brash colonialist who believes his superior technical skills make him better than the “indigeneous” cooks, and the people he wants to enslave aren’t the “natives” but white people. Eighty-one percent of known meth addicts are white people, and Walter wants each and every one of them to be addicted to his product. He’s no more a Hawkeye out to preserve Mohican culture from white incursion than he is a Lt. Dunbar determined to stall American encroachment into Sioux territory. In short: the trope Harris wants to use to condemn Breaking Bad just doesn’t apply to a show that’s more concerned with the ruthlessness of capitalist competition than the color of the working class. I’m not saying there isn’t a racial component to the show, because there obviously is. This just isn’t it. Now that I’ve got that out of my system, I can finish analyzing “Gliding Over All,” so more shortly.</span></a></div>

They have too many notes.</strong> SEK's apartment complex just installed a basketball court right next to his apartment. SEK thinks this is awesome because he finds shooting basketballs to be a zen-like activity. So at 8 a.m. SEK takes his basketball and shoots around for an hour. SEK: (shoots) SEK: (gathers rebound) SEK: (shoots) SEK: (gathers rebound) SEK: (shoots) SEK: (gathers rebound) SEK: (shoots) SEK: (gathers rebound) SEK: (shoots) SEK: (gathers rebound) SEK: (shoots) SEK: (gathers rebound) FOURTH GRADER #1 enters the court. SEK: (shoots) SEK: (gathers rebound) FOURTH GRADER #1: Pass me the ball, would you? SEK: (passes the ball) FOURTH GRADER #1: (airballs) SEK: (gathers rebound and shoots) FOURTH GRADER #1: Hey! It was still my shot! SEK: (passes the ball) Sorry about that. FOURTH GRADER #1: (airballs) FIFTH GRADER #1 appears on the court. FIFTH GRADER #1: (gathers rebound and shoots) SKRRRRRAAAAAAAAAA! SEK: Where did you come— FOURTH GRADER #2 joins him. FOURTH GRADER #2: (gathers rebound and looks around) PRRRRRAAAAAAAAAA! SEK: Where did you— As does THIRD GRADER #1. FOURTH GRADER #2: (passes to THIRD GRADER #1) FRRRRRAAAAAAAAAA! THIRD GRADER #1: (fumbles pass) KRRRRRAAAAAAAAA! SEK: (gathers ball and shoots) Some INTERDIMENSIONAL PORTAL must have been opened because... FIFTH GRADER #2: Quit hogging the ball! THIRD GRADER #2: (shoots) BRRRRRAAAAAAAAAA! FIFTH GRADER #3: (gathers rebound and airballs) NNNNNAAAAAAAAAA! FOURTH GRADER #3: (gathers rebound and airballs) MMMMMEEEEEEEEEE! SEVENTH GRADER #1: (gathers rebound) SLLLLLAAAAAMMMMM! (not even close) SIXTH GRADER #1: (gathers rebound and runs away with ball) TRRRRROOOOOOOOOO! SEK: Come back here! SIXTH GRADER #1: (throws ball into fence) TRRRRROOOOOOOOOO! (runs away) SEK: (gathers ball and makes to leave the court) ALL THE CHILDREN: HEY! COME BACK WITH OUR BALL! SEK: It's my ball! ALL THE CHILDREN: HE'S STEALING OUR BALL! SEK: IT'S MY BALL! I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU CAME FROM! ALL THE CHILDREN: THAT'S OUR BALL! IT HAS OUR NAME ON IT! SEK: YOUR NAME IS &quot;SPALDING NBA&quot;? ALL THE CHILDREN: IS YOURS? SEK declines to answer their question and walks away. He realizes that if he stayed out any longer he'd look like a creepy old man who shouldn't be playing basketball with children anyway. But since SEK lives right next to the basketball court, he walks the long way back to his apartment lest ALL THE CHILDREN realize which porch is his and decide to play Eschaton with the many plants on it.</span></a></div>
