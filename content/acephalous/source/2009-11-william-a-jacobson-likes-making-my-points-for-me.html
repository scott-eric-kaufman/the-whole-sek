			Which is unfortunate, because I&#39;m about to call him illiterate. He <a href="http://legalinsurrection.blogspot.com/2009/11/race-card-player-has-lot-to-learn.html">claims</a>
that I argued that Sarah Palin and her supporters are &quot;racist because
there were so few non-whites pictured in the available photos.&quot; I did
nothing of the sort. My claim, as you can tell by <a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/11/you-only-noticed-im-white-because-youre.html">the words I used to write it</a>,
was that the &quot;images she and her people have decided should represent
her mass-appeal on a mock-presidential bid launch&quot; demonstrates that
&quot;her own handlers consider her appeal limited to white people.&quot; I even <em>emphasized</em>
that first statement in the post, which as we all know is the online
equivalent of burying it under a rock behind the fire-pit in someone
else&#39;s backyard. (&quot;Officer, you can search my property, absolutely, but
I assure you that you won&#39;t find any claims here.&quot;) You would think
that a law professor would be able to recognize an argument when he saw
one, but apparently not, which is why he provides evidence that
bolsters mine. He quotes a reporter from MSNBC:<br /><blockquote>&quot;I
can tell you this crowd today was very, very diverse, a lot of people
from different races, ages, all coming to see Palin and wanting get a
glimpse of who this lady is that says that she&#39;s going rogue.&quot;</blockquote>If this is true—and for the moment, I grant that it is—then Palin and her handlers <em>are deliberately not posting pictures of the many non-white people who attend her events</em>.
That, Mr. Jacobson, is the sort of evidence that someone like me would
use in support of my claim that the pictures posted to her page are
designed to appeal to a specific audience. Because I don&#39;t trust you
with logic, I will draw the obvious inference for you: Palin&#39;s people
are excluding photographs of the non-white people who attend her
appearances because those photographs aren&#39;t intended to appeal to a
non-white audience.<br /><br /><em>Which was my original point</em>.<br /><br />You do realize that you&#39;re helping me out here, Mr. Jacobson, don&#39;t you?<br /><br />He
also claims that I &quot;maliciously and falsely referred to one
conservative blogger as a &#39;noted racist.&#39;&quot; But—no doubt for some reason
other than it demonstrates that Riehl&#39;s a racist—he doesn&#39;t reproduce <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/11/dan-riehl-still-a-racist-only-now-a-homophobic-one.html">the link</a>
that I included to a post demonstrating that Riehl is, in fact, a
racist. He also makes the classic debating mistake of assuming facts
not in evidence when he claims that I only did so &quot;because this is the
internet, and no one is held accountable,&quot; his assumption being that
were I to meet Riehl on the street, I wouldn&#39;t call him a racist. Of
course, being that these words are also on the internet, I can&#39;t prove
to his satisfaction that I wouldn&#39;t; however, in a different context,
he would point out the fact that because I&#39;m an academic who hangs out
with <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/06/update_africana.html">folks like this</a>, I spend all day calling <em>everybody</em> I pass on the street a racist, and since Riehl belongs to that category—how about a little freshman logic, Mr. Jacobson?<br /><blockquote>SEK calls all people who are on the street a racist.<br />Dan Riehl is a person on the street.<br />Therefore, SEK calls Dan Riehl a racist.</blockquote>I
would say that syllogism puts him in a bind, but I think we can safely
assume that someone who believed my earlier posts were intended &quot;to
smear the crowds at Palin book signings&quot; probably never took freshman
logic, and thus isn&#39;t even aware that he&#39;s in one.

The only difference now is that those people feel emboldened to <i>show</i> that they aren&#39;t alarmed by it, and actually, that really is a good thing. Obama&#39;s election has functioned as a kind of truth serum on some people to an extent, and it&#39;s good for black people in particular to see that. It makes things like the &quot;I&#39;m colorblind&quot; dodge that much more transparent.</p></span>

<p>That&#39;s correct: he just wanted see the black President and a largely black organization hanging together.</p>

<p><em>I&#39;m a lot certain he wasn&#39;t trying to organize a lynch mob.</em></p>

<p>As am I.  However, there&#39;s certainly something off about a person whose brain spits out hanging language when he tries to criticize black people.</p>

<p><em>Just cause Obama&#39;s black doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not a crappy president, you know.</em></p>

<p>Absolutely.  On this, Howard Dean and I agree.</p></span>

<p>And yet brokered more often now than before the election, mostly by people who, like Darleen, insist that the real racists are all non-white.  Even more bizarrely, they want to claim that because their ideological opponents voted for a black man, they and their ideological compatriots can&#39;t possibly be racist.  There&#39;s some strange slippage going on there.</p></span>
