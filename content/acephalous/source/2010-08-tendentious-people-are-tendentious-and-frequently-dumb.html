        <meta name="description" content="It will surprise no one who read my previous post to learn that the folks at Big Hollywood loved The Expendables exactly as much as they are ideologically required to anticipated. Still, John Nolte’s review is a teleological marvel. What he likes about the film is the simple straight-forward plot, all the B-movie mayhem you could possibly ask for, and two unapologetic hours of masculinity—which may be two hours more than we’ve seen in all of the last decade put together. These boys smoke cigars, drink beer while piloting airplanes, and return us to those glorious pre-Oprah days when stoicism was still a virtue and real men didn’t gush about their inner-emotional lives like 13 year-old girls drunk on Dr. Pepper at a slumber party. Maybe someone should tell him that the reason flat characters don’t “gush” about “their inner-emotional lives” is because they don’t have them. Maybe I should. I suppose I will. Please, Mr. Nolte, continue: Sylverster Stallone’s glorious throwback to the brawny 80s is also about something, and it’s not Bourne-ian self-discovery. It’s about something that actually matters. And in this age of nihilism when believing in anything bigger than self is considered old-fashioned, unsophisticated and naïve, that’s both refreshing and important. If you insist on italicizing the word “about,” you might want to indicate what that “something” that it’s about actually is. Sorry, I’m being rude. Mr. Nolte, you may continue: The story opens with a well-crafted action sequence involving Somalia pirates that not only establishes how deadly competent our guys are, but also that they’re not cold-blooded killers. These are men with a moral code and one of their own breaking that code will be the root cause of deadly complications and a couple over the top action sequences to come. So these are mercenaries who only ever fight the good fight? If I may, Mr. Nolte, let me recommend my friend Adam Roberts’s post on Iron Man, in which he notes that that film adheres to the dream narrative of US military involvement in the Middle East: one American is able to go to Afghanistan, kill only the bad Afghans, leave all the good Afghani men women and children alive and leap away into the sky. That “dream narrative” isn’t the product of a moral code, but simply a denial of the reality of reality. But I should let you finish: The plot gets a nudge courtesy of a self-referential Meeting of The Titans. Ever in search of a job, Barney meets with “Church” (Bruce Willis), a CIA spook in need of some housecleaning that won’t make headlines and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a long-time rival. Cinematically this is far from a great scene— First, stop pretending to be German. Second, I think you’re starting to realize that you didn’t even like the film. You call it a “B-movie,” rate its action scenes as “over the top,” and now you’re criticizing how it films a conversation. What did you think of the dialogue? [T]hese aren’t men..." />

Still, John Nolte’s <a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jjmnolte/2010/08/14/the-expendables-reminds-us-why-matt-damon-sucks/">review</a> is a teleological marvel.  What he <em>likes</em> about the film is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the simple straight-forward plot, all the B-movie mayhem  you could possibly ask for, and two unapologetic hours of  masculinity—which may be two hours more than we’ve seen in all of the  last decade put together.

<p>Maybe someone should tell him that the reason flat characters don’t “gush” about “their inner-emotional lives” is because <em>they don’t have them</em>.  Maybe I should.  I suppose I will.  Please, Mr. Nolte, continue:</p>

And in this age of nihilism when believing in  anything bigger than self is considered old-fashioned, unsophisticated  and naïve, that’s both refreshing and important.</p>

<p>If you insist on italicizing the word “about,” you might want to  indicate what that “something” that it’s about actually is.  Sorry, I’m  being rude. Mr. Nolte, you may continue:</p>

<p>So these are mercenaries who only ever fight the good fight?  If I may, Mr. Nolte, let me recommend my friend Adam Roberts’s <a href="http://punkadiddle.blogspot.com/2010/05/iron-man-2008.html">post on <em>Iron Man</em></a>, in which he notes that that film adheres to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the dream narrative of US military involvement in the  Middle East: one American is able to go to Afghanistan, kill only the  bad Afghans, leave all the good Afghani men women and children alive and  leap away into the sky.</p>

Cinematically this is far from a great scene—</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, stop <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/thesis-writing-formal-essays-turns-certain-people-into-germans.html">pretending to be German</a>.   Second, I think you’re starting to realize that you didn’t even like  the film.  You call it a “B-movie,” rate its action scenes as “over the  top,” and now you’re criticizing how it films <em>a conversation</em>.  What did you think of the dialogue?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]hese aren’t men who talk a whole lot, and when they do  it’s usually in the form of affectionate crowd-pleasing insults that  might not move the plot or add character dimension, but once again  Stallone (who co-wrote the screenplay with Dave Callahan) knows his  audience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I definitely think you  hated this film.  I mean, you’re <em>praising</em> dialogue that neither advanced the plot or added depth to the  characters because, to your mind, Stallone’s audience consist of people  who prefer pointless banter.  I can’t even tell whether you’re insulting  them more than your own intelligence here or vice versa.  Wait, I have a  test:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s also a kind of validation that comes with the  price of admission, especially for those of us who couldn’t figure out  why in the hell anyone would call metro-sexuals angsting over calling  evil what it is and apologizing for America an action movie.</p>
<p>“The Expendables” proves us right.</p>
<p>Matt Damon sucks and the eighties freaking ruled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m still not sure, but I will say this: your intelligence deserves  to be insulted, because the reason you’re saying “Matt Damon sucks” is  that he starred in movies with “Bourne-ian self-discovery,” whereas <em>The Expendables</em> “freaking ruled” because it was of the 1980s.  Guess what?  So’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bourne_Identity_%28novel%29"><em>The Bourne Identity</em></a> (1980) and, of course, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bourne_Identity_%281988_film%29"><em>The Bourne Identity</em></a> (1988).</p>
<p>Hate to burst your bubble, Mr. Nolte, but your precious ’80s were a  bit smarter and more “inner-emotional” than you’ve chosen to remember  them as.</p>

<p>But I do remain nonplussed by Matt&#39;s request (plea, even) that we &quot;just agree&quot; to dislike the character.  What&#39;s it to you, Matt?</p></span>

Bourne is a loyal and effective soldier betrayed by elements of his own out-of-control government, one which has taken to carrying out private vendettas and wasting taxpayer money on dead-end, pie-in-the-sky projects. Bourne never has moral qualms about his actions, and wants to be left alone: he&#39;s a perfect libertarian, and their failure to recognize this is just one more piece of evidence that they don&#39;t understand themselves, much less anything else.</p></span>

<p>First off, Rich, you&#39;re being a little tone deaf.  Then again, there&#39;s not enough of my initial post to get any real sense of tone.  Needless to say, I&#39;m not whining.  </p>

<p>Second, Scott, no, I didn&#39;t care if *Scott Pilgrim* succeeded or didn&#39;t.  It looks like a retreat of other Michael Cera movies, only this time with Real Live Special Effects.  Do I need to see another awkward man-child chase after a hipster girl?  Not really, not after *300 Days of Summer* or *Chasing Amy* or *Nick &amp; Nora* or or or.  The fact that the plot plays like a video game doesn&#39;t help it in my books, because as you know, I&#39;m a pretty big snob when it comes to comics, video games, etc.  </p>

<p>Finally, you can defend the whiny man-child hero.  I&#39;ll take Bogart or Brando.</p></span>

Most people do not mind hearing that someone else doesn&#39;t like a particular actor.  On the other hand, it tends to stick in people&#39;s craw when you say that they should &quot;please just agree&quot; to agree with your position, whether you&#39;re talking art, politics, or what have you.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t tell whether you saw <i>500 Days of Summer</i> and <i>Nick &amp; Nora</i> or not.  I didn&#39;t, because the reviews weren&#39;t good and no one recommended I see them, which I find is a good way to save my money and keep from getting annoyed.  Did you see them expecting to enjoy them?  Or expecting not to enjoy them?  Or did you not see them but are annoyed with the trend anyway?  Nothing wrong with that—I&#39;m annoyed by the incessant trend of remakes—but I don&#39;t find it productive to simply ask for people to stop liking them; if I&#39;m going to talk about them at all I&#39;d rather give an argument for why they&#39;re bad, rather than gripe about a personal preference.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve stopped enjoying Anthony Lane&#39;s criticism because all he does is harp on modern pop cinema (often the really easy targets, <i>Speed Racer</i>, e.g.) and complain that it&#39;s not as good as the old stuff.  That&#39;s a pretty shoddy way to make a living, but at least he gets paid for it; I don&#39;t know what would make one do it for free.  There ain&#39;t going to be no more new Bogart or Brando movies, so I would find some new stuff you like—or blog about the old—rather than just going around stating contrary preferences without elaboration.</p></span>

I pick on him because it&#39;s fun.  But it&#39;s interesting to see the response, to see how much some people have invested in such a limited actor.</p>

<p>I mean, I guess I can understand.  I used to defend Scarlett Johansson a lot, before simply accepting that, although she&#39;s wildly talented, she has no idea how to choose the right roles (or how to turn Woody Allen down).  </p>

<p>In the end, though, I was watching Altman&#39;s *3 Women* tonight, and I remembered just how different a great movie from any of this trite crap, whether it&#39;s Sly Stallone or Michael Cera.  </p></span>

<p>If you were really confident in the greatness of your favorite cinema, you wouldn&#39;t feel compelled to compare it to every summer film that comes along.  No one was expecting Edgar Wright to dethrone Altman, so your interest in putting them in the ring together shows me that you&#39;re a lot less secure in your personal canon than you like to project.  <i>I just think that&#39;s interesting.</i></p></span>

Which is why I so confidently asked, &quot;Can we all just agree, et cetera?&quot;  I was actually surprised by this reaction.  It&#39;s one thing to enjoy Cera in *Arrested Development* (he&#39;s a child, after all); it&#39;s another to put up with the same character in every one of his films, and the same character in so many other films.  </p>

<p>And yeah, of course I&#39;m insecure about my &quot;canon,&quot; as you put it.  Not because I&#39;m not confident that it&#39;s superior, but because artistic superiority means nothing today.  We don&#39;t teach it, we don&#39;t appreciate it, we don&#39;t write about it, we don&#39;t read about it.  It&#39;s an endangered species.  And when we get smart people arguing over the relative merits of a Stallone or Cera picture, well, I think we&#39;re in trouble.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f317e1ee970b-content"><p>Over here (<a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/movie-talk-sylvester-stallone-blames-batman.html)," rel="nofollow">http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/movie-talk-sylvester-stallone-blames-batman.html),</a> you can see Stalone blame the decline of the 80s muscle-and-gun genre on Tim Burton&#39;s Batman. The terms he employs are hilarious. </p>

<p>&quot;He went on to say, &#39;The action movies changed radically when it became possible to Velcro your muscles on,&#39; a clear dig at how the trim Keaton was encased in a sculpted Batsuit for the film. Stallone joked, &#39;I wish I had thought of Velcro muscles myself... I didn&#39;t have to go to the gym for all those years.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>He then goes on to make a distinction between how Burton made action films less about the actor and more about the style of the film. What strikes me as significant about Stallone&#39;s values is that he underplays the art of film making (direction, custom design) for the mere physicality of the actor. However, it also seems significant that Stalone&#39;s discourse suggests a language of masculinity and self-improvement that sees the strong male action hero attacked by directors, geeks, and other collaborators whose existence are necessary for any film to be made, let alone an action film. <br />

You know, it&#39;s hard to be a troll when I&#39;ve been commenting on Scott&#39;s blog for, I dunno, seven years now?  Sometimes I agree with him, sometimes I disagree.  But when I disagree under my real name, and not my blog name (Luther Blissett), I get called a troll.  It goes to show how much uniformity of thought people basically desire.</p>

<p>And no, it&#39;s not a &quot;kids these days&quot; complaint.  I *am* one of the kids these days.  No, it&#39;s more a complaint about what the previous generation of intellectuals did to the standards of taste.  I&#39;m a rebel against old fogies who &quot;deconstructed&quot; the canon.  </p>

<p>And JPool, sorry if the nipple tweaking gets you down.  In any case, I touched a nerve by not joining the Michael Cera whiny man-child lovefest.</p></span>

Maybe if I point out that, in this &quot;Michael Cera lovefest,&quot; <b>not one person has praised Michael Cera</b>, you&#39;ll realize that people are objecting to your superciliousness rather than the content of your opinions, as I said before.

It's finally here! Today I can be a proud white man again!*</strong> And by “it,” I mean the day when white men and white male interests are finally represented in American cinema again, for today is the day that The Expendables is released. Given my interests and the past few months of my life, you might think I’d be more excited about the film based on a graphic novel in which dialogue like this appears: You would be wrong. The good folks at Big Hollywood have spent the past week convincing me that if I fail to appreciate the manly awesomeness of The Expendables my penis will fall off. The assault on my manhood began on Monday, when Ezra Dulis reminded me of the true purpose of film itself: All you’re doing is marveling at the most sensible use of a medium that consists of moving images: incredible feats performed by tough, charismatic men. The dearth of action films designed for and marketed to men since the 1980s actually had made me forget how intimately the medium of the film and the genre of the 1980s action film were related. As Leo Grin wrote in the second installment of “Bring on ‘The Expendables’”: Rumor has it that Sylvester Stallone’s The Expendables marks a return to the glory days of 1980s action mayhem and pro-American machismo. Its appearance on the cultural horizon has certainly stirred up memories of my mid-Eighties, Midwestern suburban adolescence. Fly-over country is back! After years of being denied films that represent the “action mayhem and pro-American machismo” native to 45-year-old white men from the Midwest who once “papered over [their walls] with posters and photos of oversize he-men,” beauty school drop-out and former porn star Sylvester Stallone has directed a film that revels in the fact that the “inherently brutal nature of males isn’t a design flaw but a feature.”** But the best part about The Expendables, according to the author of the third installment in the series, is that despite being a movie geared toward men who “love seeing stuff blown up,” there is “relatively little profanity” in the film. Because God-fucking-Forbid someone embodies the inherent brutality of maleness while cursing. Just ask the author of the most recent entry in the series, Kurt Schlicter, who claims that the 1980s represent the high watermark in American cinema because of, for example, films like the “great 48 Hours (1982), [which] blew minds with violence and profanity.” But for Schlicter, the “archetypal specimen” for manly male films in the 1980s was Lethal Weapon (1987), because it was the first movie to prove that Hollywood could do something correctly; namely, produce “slick popcorn adventure/comedies with memorable action set-pieces paired with laugh-out-loud hilarity and featuring big stars and top shelf production values.” That he writes this about 1987’s Lethal Weapon despite Beverly Hills Cop having been released three years earlier is beside the point—as is the fact that he spends the majority of the review gushing about Mel Gibson—which is that all of those movies would have improved if, as Darin Miller...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/08/legitimate-questions-for-sarah-palin.html"><span><strong>Legitimate Questions for Sarah Palin</strong> Sarah Palin’s latest inane statement, “Legitimate Questions for the President,” may be inane, but it demonstrates quite nicely how those on the left lost the rhetorical battle concerning what she calls “this Ground Zero mosque.” As Eric Rauchway pointed out, Manhattan Island is a small place—only about 13 miles long and 2.3 wide—that looms larger in our collective imagination because of its social and cultural importance. If you asked Palin or any of the others who have temporarily abandoned their disdain for all things East Coast and elitist whether it would be acceptable if someone built a mosque within a 1.5 mile radius of where the Twin Towers once stood, they would likely continue protesting because they are utterly ignorant of the fact that that roughly eliminates everything south of NYU.* To their minds, New York City is less of a teeming than an endless metropolis, one that begins on the southern tip of the island and extends beyond the horizons to the north and east and west. They fail to recognize that there was a reason New Yorkers stopped building out and started building up—there is only so much room on an island 22 square miles in area—and so they assume that renovating a Men’s Wearhouse into a community center must, perforce, be an insult to the memories of the victims of 9/11. Their reaction to learning that the mosque being built on Ground Zero is actually a community center being built two blocks away is a stubborn spectacle couched in deliberately deceptive language. Palin’s rhetorical transformation of “the mosque being built on Ground Zero” into “this Ground Zero mosque” would be brilliant if intentional. It draws a scar across an infinite island and declares everything to its south to be sacred American soil. The area she calls “Ground Zero” is a fictional place in whose name she and her ideological brethren can express their xenophobia without fear of being called xenophobic. She and they can claim to support the good Muslims—the ones who know that their place, literally, is not in lower Manhattan—safe in the knowledge that, with a wink, their fear of people with strange names from foreign lands can arguably be something other than it is. In her mind and theirs, “this Ground Zero mosque” is less of a building than a psychological representation of the controversy caused by their ignorance of the island’s geography, i.e. they have retooled their own stupidity into a potent rhetorical feint whose truth is undeniable because it refers to the debate about an imaginary building on an infinitely large island. For Palin and those like her, the “Ground Zero” in “this Ground Zero mosque” functions not as a reference to the former site of the Twin Towers, but as a simple adjective that identifies the particular “mosque” in question. That it happens not to be located on Ground Zero is, at this point in the conversation, irrelevant. Palin proves this by obfuscation. Her concern about “this Ground Zero mosque” is...</span></a></div>
