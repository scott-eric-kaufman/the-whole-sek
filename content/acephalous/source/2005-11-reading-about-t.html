<p>Which brings me to a related conversation my stalwart stalking-horse, John Emerson, brought about.&nbsp; All I can say is that I'm thankful my conversation with <a href="http://www.adamkotsko.com/weblog/2005/11/darwin-race-catholicism.html">Doug Johnson</a> avoids the shallow gunplay of anti-intellectual brouhahas.&nbsp; The core issue is similar: a misrepresentation of the historical stature of Darwinian theory is used to condemn contemporary Darwinian theory.&nbsp; Just as Lysenko's ideological application of Lamarckian theory . . . </p>

<p>Here is my measured and intellectually honest response to Doug's measured and intellectually honest query:</p><blockquote><p>First, and most importantly, the reason not to link Darwin to the
eugenics movement (outside of familial relations) is simply that up
until &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_synthesis">The Modern Synthesis</a>,&quot;
Darwinism wasn't the dominant evolutionary theory; in fact, there were
many competing evolutionary theories--some of which, like Lamarckism,
were antithetical to Darwinian theory, shunning core ideas like
&quot;natural selection.&quot; The reason we look back, after the Modern
Synthesis (established in the '30s and '40s) and think there's a
relationship between Darwinian theory and eugenics is because, in the
end, a variation of Darwinian theory turned out to be correct. had
Lamarck been correct, we'd probably all intuit a connection between
acquired characteristics and eugenics (and think that because some
people cannot acquire benefitial characteristics, they should be put
down). Let me put it this way:</p>


<p>Vernon Kellogg, writing about the decline of Darwinian thought among evolutionists in <em>Darwinism Today</em>
(1908), sought to inform his readers about &quot;the various new theories of species-forming with whose
names, such as heterogenesis, orthogenesis, metakinesis, geographic
isolation, biologic isolation, organic selection, or orthoplasty, [they]
occasionally meet in [their] general reading.&quot; At the time, then, that
eugenics movement picked up steam in the US, Darwinism was on the wane
and all those other variations of evolutionary thought were on the
ascent. </p>

<p>To put it another way: Herbert Spencer, the most
popular philosopher of the day, was a Lamarckian, not a Darwinian, and
yet his name's normally tossed out there as one of the founders of
Social Darwinism. This may sound like I'm nit-picking about the names
of evolutionary theory, but I'm not: the imagined historical connection
of, say, scientific racism or eugenics in 1908 to (pun intended)
Darwinism today, in 2005, is constantly evoked. The argument, never
stated, is that the current form of Darwinian thought ought to be
distrusted now because of the deleterious effects it had on society
then. </p>

<p>Only it didn't. To really see which evolutionary ideas
were &quot;the dangerous ones,&quot; we'd have to look back at which variation of
evolutionary theory a particular proponent of eugenics believed in. But
that introduces another problem. I said above that Spencer, the man who
coined the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest,&quot; was a Lamarckian. But he
always claimed to be a Darwinian, despite the fact that if you look at
what he wrote and the way evolution worked--progressively, as in his
infamous phrase, &quot;from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous&quot;--you'll
see nothing but an explanation of Lamarckian ideas. And this is
Spencer, the single most influential philosopher of the period. There's
a reason Stephen Jay Gould called this time &quot;a decade of maximal
agnosticism and diversity in evolutionary theories.&quot;</p>

<p>Why then do we associate eugenics and the like with Darwinian thought?&nbsp; As Peter Bowler wrote in <em>The Non-Darwinian Revolution</em>:
&quot;the pre-Darwinian history of evolutionism is manipulated to show that
earlier naturalists were really groping their way toward Darwinism.&quot;
Like all Whig histories, this one &quot;distorts the past by picking out a
main line of development whose inevitable end product will be the
triumph of those telling the story. Any event that does not fit into
the scheme is either ignored or distorted so that it does fit.&quot; &quot;This,&quot;
Bowler concludes, &quot;is exactly the pattern followed by the scientific
community to create the conventional image of the Darwinian Revolution.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>How do you know this, Mr. Self-Citation Man?&nbsp; Simple:</p><blockquote><p>I recently (thanks to <a href="http://mclemee.com/id4.html">Scott McLemee</a>,
who sent them) began looking into the history of the “Little Blue Book”
series, since it published both London’s work in pamphlet form, as well
as primers on “The Survival of the Fittest” and the like.&nbsp; What’s
significant about these isn’t their materiality per se, but the
relation of their materiality to their distribution; understanding the
relation of these two aspects is critical to understanding 1) how
people were learning what they knew about evolutionary theory and 2)
how widespread these ideas were.&nbsp; I haven’t been able to track down
publication data for them yet--haven’t had time to really look,
actually--but it will be one factor in which aspects of evolutionary
theory I really ought to address.&nbsp; Reading oodles of contemporary
newspapers and magazines, both local and country-wide, has already
narrowed the field immensely.&nbsp; As my new stalker, John Emerson, will
attest, I’m currently writing a little about this <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/adamkotsko/113257386045070078/#364741">elsewhere</a>.

</p>

<p>
On this same front, I don’t know where I’d be without my copy of Hackett’s <em>70 Years of Bestsellers</em>.&nbsp; I know there’s an updated edition, but they’re not going to sell any more copies of <em>The Jungle</em>
in 1904 than they already have.&nbsp; The relation of what, in literary
circles, typically passes for “a popular novel” doesn’t correspond in
the least to which novels were actually popular.&nbsp; To return to
Sinclair, every essay I’ve read about <em>The Jungle</em> discusses how
popular and influential it was, the suggestion being that it dominated
the literary marketplace and was the book everyone talked about and
read...well, it wasn’t.&nbsp; Influential, yes, but it barely outsold
Margaret Deland’s <em>The Awakening of Helena Ritchie</em> and wasn’t in spitting distance of Winston Churchill’s <em>Coniston</em>. 
Now, this doesn’t take into consideration lending libraries, ubiquitous
pirate copies, &amp;c.&nbsp; But it does indicate the need to inject some
Moretti-esque empirical data into our scholarship.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

Turns out I hit on a variation of the perfect business model: Collect underpants. ??? Profit! The way Amazon Associates works is simple: if you click through to Amazon from Acephalous and place some junk in your shopping trunk, 4% of whatever you end up spending gets deposited in my now overflowing coffers. Since that Typepad Tip Jar strikes me as crass capitalism, I want to float the following idea: if you're a loyal reader, appreciate what I write here and are going to make a purchase through Amazon anyway, why not click here first and help a starving grad. student starve a little less. Granted, maybe &quot;starve&quot; is too strong a word . . . so how about &quot;inebriated&quot; instead? (As in &quot;Help an inebriated grad. student drink a little more?&quot;) Full disclosure: I only say this because there's something slimy about my having set this up and y'all &quot;contributing&quot; to the site without knowing it for the past few months. I'm all about transparency and guilt. Crippling guilt.</span></a></div>
