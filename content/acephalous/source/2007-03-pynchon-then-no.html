Not to dredge up old animosities, but more and more Pynchon seems burdened by his distinctive voice. When his characters speak in their own voices, they sound like the stilted hack-work of an imitator; when they speak in his voice, they rise to Pynchonian heights, but they do so at the cost of being recognizable characters. In Gravity's Rainbow, Pynchon was better able to strike a balance. It has taken me four months to publish this post, as I'm annoyed by my own reaction to Against the Day.

<p>I remember being kinda unimpressed with the voices and speech styles of the characters in Vineland at the time, too, but what stays in the mind this much later are the hilarious and strange descriptions of events, so I have a vague glow of well-meaning toward that book.</p>

<p>What did you think of Mason &amp; Dixon in terms of the voices? Were the strange 18th-C typographical tics enough to justify their dialogue in your mind? </p>

<p>It&#39;s been a long time since I revisited Pynchon. I wonder if I have progressed past my first crush. </p>

<p>In other excessive Faulknerian sentence news, I just got a new Cormac McCarthy book. Since I have to be in a nondepressive mood to read him, though, it will be a while before I actually tackle it.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-64834576-content"><p>Two hundred pages left -- and they&#39;ve been left since the beginning of February.  I know I&#39;ll finish eventually, but I&#39;m in no hurry, in part because I know the ending won&#39;t really &quot;do&quot; anything: you can&#39;t tie up what&#39;s not hanging in any interesting way.</p>

<p>The novel feels &quot;underwritten,&quot; undercooked, to use Peter Elbow&#39;s term.  In too many places, it&#39;s like a hastily written outline of a Pynchon novel.  (Much like Morrison&#39;s *Love* was a hastily written skeleton of a Morrison novel -- which it was, because her publishers forced her to get it out before she was finished with it.)  </p>

<p>It&#39;s sad to me not only because I love Pynchon&#39;s work.  It&#39;s sad because this should have been his best novel.  The historical material is far richer, and the plot lines -- Western vengeance novel lingering after the death of the frontier; Victorian boys adventure story lingering after the death of Victorian optimism; anarchist espionage novel about to be swallowed up in the real chaos of world war; novel of mathematical ideas about to be swallowed up by Einsteinian physics -- could have continued Pynchon&#39;s rethinking of globalization started in *Mason &amp; Dixon*.  The Chicago World&#39;s Fair itself should have presented him with enough rich material to fill a novel -- Christ, Chris Ware did a far better job with that stuff.  Pabst&#39;s Blue Ribbon won the damned blue ribbon there!  Juicy Fruit started there!</p>

<p>(The issue of narrative voice Scott raises is more complex, in part because there are several narrative voices in this novel.  The perky Victorian boys novelist; the salty Western voice; the Conradian espionage voice.  All of Pynchon&#39;s novels have characters who speak in &quot;his&quot; voice -- the feng shui master in *M&amp;D* and DL&#39;s &quot;mother superior&quot; at the ninja retreat come to mind.  And I read Pynchon for that voice, that Fitzgeraldian oratory, not the pastiche schtick.  I guess I&#39;m not as much a stickler for &quot;doing the police in different voices.&quot;  My problem is that *ATD* has too much plot exposition and not enough &quot;Pynchon&quot; voice.</p></span>

For those wondering where Cerebus went, I note that my reading Wilde in my spare time has something to do having received Melmoth last week. More on that later.) I’m reading literary biographer extraordinaire Richard Ellmann’s Oscar Wilde and, as I always do with scholarly material, I hopped onto JSTOR to read reviews. (Were this another sort of post, I’d write something about why I feel the need to read reviews of every scholarly monograph I read. Were this another sort of post, I’d write about how frustrating it is to not be able to find any reviews of scholarly monographs until five years after they’ve been published. Were this another sort of post, I’d announce that our solution to this problem is host yet another book event, this time on Amanda Claybaugh’s The Novel of Purpose: Literature and Social Reform in the Anglo-American World. But this is not another sort of post.) As I was saying, I was sifting reviews of Oscar Wilde when I stumbled upon a review of Melissa Knox’s Oscar Wilde: A Long and Lovely Suicide. Its reputation seems to hinge on how the reviewer feels about vulgar Freudianism—recent concessions about literary Freudianism aside, I think my position on psychoanalysis sufficiently established—still, I’m baffled by the final sentence of John Stokes’ review: A book as profoundly wrong-headed as this can never produce the right answer for the very reason that psychic processes are of their very nature over-determined, which is also why the debate about Wilde and syphilis will fester for a long while yet. I understand that this is one of those rare cases in which literary interpretation can yield a correct answer—Oscar Wilde either (1) did or (2) did not contract syphilis—so the nod to “the right answer” is not throwing me here. Nor is it the pun on syphilitic discourse—although I wonder whether the question of Wilde carried what the English called morbus gallicus (&quot;the French disease&quot;) and the French called la maladie anglaise (&quot;the English disease&quot;) will fester in quite the same way its trademark pox will. What confuses me is that Stokes seems to identify as “profoundly wrong-headed” the very methodology he employed in judging it “profoundly wrong-headed.” This oddity can be attributed to a problem with conventional academic reviews. Unlike popular arbiter-of-taste—who, if not a known quantity, borrows some cultural capital from the venue in which the review is published—no one assumes any academic reviewer is without methodological bias. There is no singular conception of quality to which an academic reviewer can pretend to measure a work against. Despite this, most academic reviews are written as if there were, the result being strange compressions like the one quoted above. Obviously, this isn’t the only problem with academic reviews, and my annoyance is such that I may even start a series in which I complain and complain and complain ...</span></a></div>
