I've done my damnedest to reconstruct the history of Dublin from Ulysses of humans, human-looking robots, robot-looking robots and Cylons on Battlestar Galactica. The dates are purposely vague: I'm more interested in the order in which events occurred than precisely dating them. 5,000ish years ago: Humans inhabit Earth. They leave. Stop at the Algae Planet and build the Temple of Athena so future people can find their way back. Keep on moving and settle on Kobol. 4,000ish years ago: The residents of Kobol create a race of robot slaves that look exactly like humans, i.e. in their own image. These robots can resurrect but not reproduce. Some sort of Blade Runner-scenario maybe ensues? Can't tell but could be important. Either way, the monotheistic Thirteenth Tribe of human-looking robots leaves Kobol and—in Ellen Tigh's words—backtracks to Earth. They stop on the Algae Planet to find the way to Earth. They re-colonize it. 3,500ish years ago: But they are lazy. So the human-looking robots on Earth build robot slaves who look like proper robots. No chance of a Blade Runner-scenario there. Their slaves look like robots. By this point the human-looking robots have acquired the ability to reproduce sexually and do so for so long they eventually forget how to resurrect. 2,000ish years ago (on Earth): The human-looking robots we know as Ellen and Saul Tigh, Galen Tyrol, Samuel Anders and Tory Foster (henceforth &quot;Ellen and the Gang&quot;) are born and become scientists. They are warned that their robot slaves plan to destroy them. They rediscover resurrection technology and put a resurrection ship in orbit. The human-looking robots and their robot-looking slaves mutually assure their own destruction—except for Ellen and the Gang, whose brains are downloaded up to their new bodies on the resurrection ship. 2,000ish years ago (on Kobol): Something happens. The Twelve Tribes of humans leave Kobol and settle on twelve loosely-affiliated planets. Each of the Twelve Colonies develops an individual mono-planetary culture because that is what happens in science fiction. Between 2,000ish years ago and 53 years ago (in Twelve Colonies): Mono-planetary cultures notwithstanding, humans become lazy again. Like the human-looking robots of the Thirteenth Tribe, these humans learned from their mistakes and did not make their new robot slaves in their image. They made Toasters. The Toasters rebelled. The Twelve Colonies unite under the Articles of Colonization. Between 2,000ish years ago and 53 years ago (on their way from Earth to the Twelve Colonies): Ellen and the Gang move at sub-light speed.

			<p>(<em><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/not-infodumps-constellations.html">Explanation</a></em>.)</p><p>I&#39;ve done my damnedest to reconstruct the history <del>of Dublin from <em>Ulysses</em></del> of humans, human-looking robots, robot-looking robots and Cylons on <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>. The dates are purposely vague: I&#39;m more interested in the order in which events occurred than precisely dating them.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>5,000ish years ago:</strong> Humans inhabit Earth. They leave. Stop at the Algae Planet and build the Temple of Athena so future people can find their way back. Keep on moving and settle on Kobol.</p>

<p><strong>4,000ish years ago:</strong> The residents of Kobol create a race of robot slaves that look exactly like humans, <em>i.e.</em> in their own image.

The human-looking robots and their robot-looking slaves mutually assure their own destruction—except for Ellen and the Gang, whose brains are downloaded up to their new bodies on the resurrection ship.</p>

<p><strong>2,000ish years ago (on Kobol):</strong> Something happens. The Twelve Tribes of humans leave Kobol and settle on twelve loosely-affiliated planets. Each of the Twelve Colonies develops an individual mono-planetary culture because that is what happens in science fiction.</p>

<p><strong>Between 2,000ish years ago and 53 years ago (in Twelve Colonies):</strong> Mono-planetary cultures notwithstanding, humans become lazy again. Like the human-looking robots of the Thirteenth Tribe, these humans learned from their mistakes and did not make their new robot slaves in their image. They made <a href="http://media.battlestarwiki.org/images/thumb/b/b2/Cent_005.jpg/250px-Cent_005.jpg">Toasters</a>. The Toasters rebelled. The Twelve Colonies unite under the Articles of Colonization.

</p><p><strong>Between 2,000ish years ago and 53 years ago (on their way from Earth to the Twelve Colonies):</strong> Ellen and the Gang move at sub-light speed. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation#Time_dilation_and_space_flight">Time dialates</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Approximately 53 to 40 years ago:</strong> The Toasters and the Twelve Colonies fight a war. On the Toasters&#39; home planet—wherever that is—they try and develop their own human-looking robots. These are the hybrids who control their ships. Ellen and the Gang finally reach the Twelve Colonies. They convince the Toasters to end the war with the humans by promising to help them create human-looking robots.</p>

<p><strong>Between 40 years ago and the <em>Miniseries</em>:</strong> Ellen and the Gang are true to their word. The first one they create is named Number One. He&#39;s modeled after Ellen&#39;s father. He helps Ellen and the Gang create Numbers Two through Eight. He develops issues. Doesn&#39;t like that he was created with human limitations. Wants to see nebulae explode in infrared. He orchestrates two plots: one is to kill and have Ellen and the Gang resurrected in the colonies—he wants them to suffer the limitations they imposed on him—and another to have Number Seven, a.k.a. Daniel, permanently boxed. Ellen and the Gang live among the Twelve Colonies until the Cylons attack again by nuking them in the <em>Miniseries</em> and then the show started.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Important Final Point:</strong></p>

<p>One thing that confuses people is that all the robots are called Cylons. They shouldn&#39;t be. We should only speak of Cylons when referring to the Toasters, the hybrids they created, and the human-looking robots they created with the help of Ellen, Saul, Galen, Anders and Tory. Why? Because we know that human historians did not refer to the Thirteenth Tribe as Cylons, and the Ellen, Saul, Galen, Anders and Tory are descendents of the Thirteenth Tribe. You could make a larger argument about lineage and descent—the fact that Saul can procreate with Number Six means they belong to the same species—but I&#39;m not about to label as &quot;American&quot; everyone who lives in Russia just because I could father a child by a Russian woman.</p>

<p><strong>Unimportant Brief Note: </strong></p>

<p>In an interview, the biggest name attached to the spin-off, Eric Stoltz, said he was playing a character named &quot;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0090099/">Daniel Graystone</a>&quot; on <em>Caprica</em>. Make of it what you will. Given the timeline sketched above, I think we probably have Number One exiling a Daniel along with Ellen and the Gang because he was Ellen&#39;s favorite. Whether this has anything to do with Starbuck—Daniel was supposedly artistically inclined, Starbuck&#39;s father was a composer—I don&#39;t know.</p>

		<span id="comment-148646627-content"><p>In a way, I sort of hope so.  Because honestly, I was totally baffled after-the-fact by last night&#39;s episode.  While watching, it all made sense.  But as soon as I tried to sort it out, I realized I couldn&#39;t . . . at least, not without a close reading I couldn&#39;t.  So I went back, read around, and put together the only thing that works.  I&#39;m sure fanboys will pick apart the dates, but the dates are less important than the sequence here---because all the emotional resonance depends on who did what to whom after what, not who did what to whom on 22 January 2214.</p>

<p>But yes, I expect as many people will think I desecrated their beloved as will thank me for ordering the available evidence for their convenience.</p>

<p>(As for the mono-planetary culture bit, there&#39;s actually been a lot of interesting work done on that issue.  There&#39;s a sort of inherent utopianism to the idea that a planet could coalesce around a particular set of values, which would be great if it wasn&#39;t accompanied by the inconvenient fact that other planets coalesced around other planets and <b>WAR WAR WAR</b>!  That just makes it all into a more expansive version of a very mundane notion of the border dispute.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-148646977-content"><p>I think the first part of this timeline is wrong.  The gods created humans on Kobol; the humans created humanoid &quot;cylons&quot; (also presumably on Kobol).  The humanoid &quot;cylons&quot; the humans created left Kobol and colonized Earth, building the temple of five on the algae planet on their way to Earth; the humans meanwhile left Kobol and colonized the twelve colonies.</p>

<p>The humanoid &quot;cylons&quot; on Earth created their own version of mechanical toasters; these Earth-built mechanical toasters destroyed Earth and humanoid &quot;cylon&quot; civilization.  The Final Five, warned by Head Six type hallucinations, were ready for the end and uploaded into their waiting ship, having rebuilt the resurrection technology of the gods, intending to go to the humans and warn them not to repeat their mistake.  The Final Five retrace their path to the algae planet, stop a while, keep going till they get to the colonies.</p>

<p>The Final Five arrive at the colonies during the first cylon war (between mechanical toasters and humans).  The toasters have been trying to create humanoid models unsuccessfully.  The Five agree to help them in return for stopping the war against the humans... They create the eight brand new humanoid &quot;cylons,&quot; modeled genetically on Earth-based humanoid &quot;cylons&quot; (which explains why they&#39;re genetically alike, and should all be called cylons if any of the biological cylons are called cylons).  You pretty much get the rest right. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-148647175-content"><p>Lee, I&#39;m not sure where we&#39;re disagreeing.  I know that the humans on Kobol thought their gods created them there, but if they had, the human-looking robots of the Thirteenth Tribe wouldn&#39;t have been able to locate Earth via the temple on the Algae Planet, right?  That&#39;s from last night&#39;s episode, where Ellen talked about them having to &quot;backtrack&quot; from Kobol to Earth.  Given that you can&#39;t &quot;backtrack&quot; to somewhere you&#39;ve never been before, aren&#39;t we stuck assuming that humans had originally lived on Earth?  (Because the first generation of human-looking robots, the Thirteenth Tribe, were built on Kobol.)</p>

<p>This is where I should say that I&#39;m honestly interested in figuring out what happened, not arguing about whose pet theory is right.  If I&#39;m missing some vital bit of evidence, tell me and I&#39;ll edit the original post to reflect it.  (Especially since the rest of your account squares with mine, Lee.  I think we&#39;re on the same page, so I&#39;d like to know what you make of the &quot;backtracking&quot; comment.)</p></span>

That is, when the Thirteenth Tribe had initially gone from Kobol to Earth, they built the Temple of Five; when the Final Five left Earth, more than (I think) sixteen hundred years later, they were the ones who backtracked (starting from Earth) on the way to finding the twelve human-inhabited Colonies.  They hung out a while on the algae planet, at which point something mysterious and &quot;miraculous&quot; happened imprinting their images to the Temple for Deanna to discover later, then the Final Five eventually made their way to the twelve colonies (perhaps with a pit stop on Kobol)... but I may be wrong.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-148648573-content"><p>Lee is correct regarding the backtracking. Ellen however says that the 13th Tribe stopped on the Algae Planet to pray for guidance. It&#39;s not clear whether the 13th Tribe was simply looking for guidance to a suitable place to settle, or whether they were looking for guidance to Earth. As the latter possibility hasn&#39;t been foreclosed, it&#39;s possible that the Humans originated on Earth and then traveled to Kobol. Since the Pythian prophecies spoke of Earth, and they predated the return of the Final Five, it would suggest that Humans had experience with Earth prior to the 13th Tribe settling there. The sky-map in the Temple on Kobol also suggested that Earth was a known entity.     </p></span>

<p>&quot;You can&#39;t backtrack to somewhere you&#39;ve never been before&quot;: Why not? The point of &quot;tracking&quot; a prey is to find out where it went, so you can find where it is &quot;now,&quot; when you meet up with it.

		<span id="comment-148677975-content"><p>Odd side note: <a href="http://www.galactica-science.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/battlestar-galactica-s04e17-no-exit-4128-baseship-with-orion-in-background.jpg" rel="nofollow">We know exactly where the baseship Boomer and Ellen escaped is</a>.</p>

<p>As to the backtracking thing, here&#39;s the dialogue:</p>

<blockquote><b>Cavil:</b> It’s not likely. By planting that carnival trick to reveal your own faces, you left me no choice.

<p><b>Ellen:</b> We didn’t plant anything. We backtracked the path of our ancestors---found their temple. The one true God must have orchestrated these events.</blockquote></p>

<p>Ellen is pretty clearly saying what y&#39;all have said: Ellen and the Gang retraced the Thirteenth Tribe&#39;s path too Earth in order to find the Colonies.  But if that&#39;s the case, then all the stuff with the Temple of Hope had to have happened <em>after</em> they connected with the Cylons---or they just planted that memory in the Three&#39;s (Threes&#39;?) head(s).  And if the virus on the satellite was deadly to the Cylon skinjobs, wouldn&#39;t it have been deadly to Ellen and the Gang?</p>

<p>(Wow---My head&#39;s not up for speculating today.  Feel too dense.  More later.)</p></span>

Does Ellen believe, or not? Was she being sarcastic?</p>

<p>Also, do we really <i>know</i> the &quot;humanoid Cylons&quot; inhabiting Earth are not simply <i>human</i> (and thus, perhaps, that all humans at one point were able to resurrect)?

And even if you assume the Colonial Centurion toasters converted the Five to monotheism, Ellen&#39;s belief in the One True God could easily retroactively be applied as an explanatory framework to make sense of past events (events which occurred while the Five were still polytheists).  In any event, I think the evidence suggests that the Five were *already* monotheists when they left Earth, and that the Colonial Centurions were also monotheists.  Remember:  all the head hallucinations are advocates of monotheists, and the Five admit to having been contacted by such hallucinations before the Earth Centurions destroyed Earth-based humanoid cylon civilization.</p></span>

<p>They do say that the Thirteenth Tribe were robots created by the other twelve tribes, and they&#39;re the ones who end up on Earth.  That said, way back when I had it in my head to claim that <em>everyone</em> on the show was a Cylon, <em>i.e.</em> that humans may&#39;ve existed at one point in time, but that they&#39;d long been extinct, replaced by organic machines along the lines of Number One and company.  </p>

<p>Lee, nice points about the headcases being monotheists, but one problem: I don&#39;t think Baltar was a monotheist when he first had the visions.  Didn&#39;t Six have to <em>convince</em> him to become a monotheist?  Also, what do we make of Lee&#39;s vision of Starbuck after she&#39;d disappeared?  Is he a monotheist?  (And wait, was that a vision, or was that her?  I can&#39;t remember now.)</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of assumptions being made on my part, KB.  (By the way, your nifty flowchart is far more effective at showing the parallel narratives than is my post.  Wish I&#39;d have thought to do it like that.)</p>

<p>Gerry Caravan neatly summed up what I (and everyone else) are assuming with the concept of &quot;<a href="http://gerrycanavan.blogspot.com/2009/02/bsg-word-of-day.html" rel="nofollow">the fanon</a>,&quot; <em>i.e.</em> the shared assumptions of an online fanbase created by that fanbase.  (At least, that&#39;s what I take it to mean.)  The only problem with that is that I didn&#39;t consult the online fanbase, because I wanted to figure it out by myself.  (Such is the nature of <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/not-infodumps-constellations.html" rel="nofollow">my obsession</a>.  I wonder whether I would&#39;ve enjoyed <em>Ulysses</em> a lot less if I&#39;d been able to read it alongside some of the web concordances.)</p></span>

Constellations.</strong> The infodump, as Todd VanDerWerff points out, may well be the single generic feature shared by all flavors of science fiction: You might find some infodumping in a Western or in a period piece, but for the most part, we know the rules those genres play by because those genres take place in our reality, just in the past . . . . To a large degree, the division between hard and soft [science fiction] often hinges on things like infodumps. The hard [science fiction] is often for the people who are really, really interested in the science part of the science fiction equation. The soft stuff skews more toward the fiction end of things and isn’t particularly concerned with plausibility much of the time. This strikes me as wrong in one crucial respect: the infodumps about which people complain occur at the outset of a work. They're presented as the technological enablers of the narrative to follow. They are exposition before the fact—before readers have any emotional investment in the characters whose narratives are enabled by the infodumped technology. No surprise, then, that people whose primarily invest in character or narrative find the lengthy technological preambles of hard science fiction off-putting. To label as infodump the exposition on the Battlestar Galactica episode &quot;No Exit&quot; is to be a little too literal. &quot;No Exit&quot; did &quot;dump&quot; quite a bit of &quot;info&quot; on its audience, but the information was not intended to make the narrative work, because it already does. You cannot have an infodump four seasons into a series: you can only have a revelation. The argument should be whether too much information was revealed too quickly, but what else were the characters meant to do? Naming an episode after Sartre's No Exit signals a forthcoming entrapment of the character's own devising. Their Hell will be the other people they're trapped with. But that's not where I'm headed with this post. I think the thematic parallels with Sartre's play are important—certainly significant is the implication that this is a Hell of their own devising, one in which they remain not by force or compulsion, but through fear of the unknown. (That all the characters begin by talking about what happened on Earth, only to become increasingly occupied with their own infighting seems an important parallel, even if I am being a bit literal.) What I want to focus on the effect on a viewer when almost 70 hours of thin-streaming history are followed by one of torrential exposition. On a certain type of reader/viewer, the result is little different than the cumulative effect reading Ulysses or Gravity's Rainbow or Infinite Jest; namely, this person feels like the night sky yearns to snap into constellations—he feels like the heavens look down on, disappointed, because some personal failing prevents him from discovering the order they contain. So what does this person do? If he's reading Ulysses, he maps Joyce's universe onto the tram-lines of William Martin Murphy in order to demonstrate that...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/little-bit-more-on-teaching-the-dark-knight.html"><span><strong>Little bit more on teaching The Dark Knight</strong> What's the point of cataloging film and comic conventions in a composition course? Students should leave my class knowing that the mechanics of a film or comic reveal the intentions of the mechanic. Am I doing an end-around theoretical objections to authorial intent? I certainly am—because I want to instill in my roomful of future rhetors that they need to pay attention to the effect their prose will have on their audience. I want to slow down the process whereby they make claims, and the best way to do that is to explain the joke. Consider the fundraiser scene in The Dark Knight. I start shortly before the Joker puts the knife to Dawes' throat. Here he is approaching her: It's a medium long shot with a slightly shallow focus. Viewers know who to focus on, but are also given a strong sense of the mise-en-scene. This frame belongs to a fairly long and unbroken tracking shot: Note how the camera moves back more slowly than the Joker moves forward, transforming the medium long into a medium shot: As the camera follows the Joker, the crowd slips off the frame—but we know what the mise-en-scene contains. The camera moves with the Joker until this moment: Now it swings to the left and begins to bring the crowd back into the frame. As the camera pivots the frame momentarily centers on Dawes before returning the Joker. The immediate intent is fairly straightforward: Nolan wants to keep the attention focused on the Joker. Viewers now must gauge how Dawes reacts by how the Joker or the crowd reacts to her reaction. The camera continues moving left until the entire crowd is back in the frame. Note that over the next three frames Nolan will show the crowd assembled behind the Joker in its entirety: For those shots the camera traces a circle around the Joker. The viewer attends to his face because the camera gravitates around him like the Earth around the sun. The camera moves behind Dawes's head and brings them into profile: At this point it begins to describe a circle around her instead of him. The effect is delicate if disorienting. Note that over these three frames Nolan shows the entire crowd behind her in its entirety: We now know who is behind her as well as him. Nolan again uses the profile shot to switch dance partners. The camera now circles the Joker again and again Nolan uses the attention on the Joker to scan the crowd behind him in its entirety: Why all the circling? The first reason is kinetic: a shot and reverse shot combination would have settled the action down by introducing a conversational rhythm. The second reason is temporal: once a director starts reversing shots the audience begins to experience time as a function of narrative. The first person says their say. The second person says their say. The first person responds. The second responds. I should note that this is a natural reaction...</span></a></div>
