		<span id="comment-15408355-content"><p>In high school Advanced Grammar and Composition -- still the most useful course I ever took in 26 consecutive years as a student -- we used something called the &quot;Fog Index&quot; to determine the &quot;grade level&quot; at which we were writing.  I&#39;m too lazy to google it to see if it still is in use.  Nonetheless, it became something of a sport -- among the boys in the class, at least -- to see how MASSIVE and GIRTHY our fog index could be if we really, really tried to &quot;go huge.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;d try to analyze that competitive drama, but I don&#39;t know if anyone has ever developed an, um, instrument that would allow us to -- you know -- probe the inner psyche of the virginal young male mind.  When that happens, I think many aspects of human experience will instantly ripen for study.</p></span>

Is There Anybody In There?</strong> No. However I did post something relatively substantial elsewhere this evening. Check it out if you're at all interested in evolutionary minutiae. If you're not 1) I don't know why you read my blog and 2) you may be interested in this artifact recovered from the depths of Gmail's spam folder. Yes, that is Adam's review of the Clarke shortlist. According to his email, he &quot;thought [he] was being all soft and cuddly,&quot; whereas everyone else thought he was being &quot;Nasty . . . And not in a Christina Agulera way.&quot; (He's already confessed his eternal shame at not being able to spell Her Holiness' name. However, I suspect that's the very error which relegated him to the spam folder in the first place.) I'll respond to the exceptional comments I've received on yesterday's post tomorrow. I'd respond tonight, but after a day of grading and a night of revising half of an essay I wrote weeks ago and am still incredibly unsatisfied with, I fear I'd catch some of the grumpiness going around. W. [EDIT: That was a typepad artifact. Now it's something awesome instead. When you save a draft of a post, the cursor's always in the &quot;post continuation&quot; window instead of the &quot;post introduction&quot; window. I don't know why it does that. But we can pretend the &quot;W&quot; is more meaningful. See!]</span></a></div>

(And me!) The emails poured in: &quot;Who who who who who who who?&quot; That conversation with the sensational comments is still going strong . . . or would be had I any intellectual wherewithal tonight. Tomorrow! An email entitled &quot;URGENT!!!&quot; just arrived. [someone else] wants to know &quot;Who who who who who who who?&quot; Didn't I just cover this? Every grant and fellowship application must be postmarked by midnight April 10th or the applicant will be strung up and pelted with cranberries. Why is that? What so I'm an asshole now because I haven't answered your email of forty-five seconds ago? You really want to know who who who who who who who? Lionel Ritchie. Adam thinks he's so funny. Well . . . he is. Usually. Side-splittingly. Only tonight he's wrong. (In baseball though he'd be batting .700 and that ain't too shabby.) [EDIT: Maybe Adam isn't wrong. But he really oughta be.] What do you mean you don't believe me? But but but I sounded so sincere. You want to know who who who who who who who else? Mandy Patikin. Last night The Little Womedievalist—she's the looker in the goofy hat next to some goofy fool she shouldn't even admit to knowing—and I had so few brain cells firing we watched this thing . It had little plot and what it did have was mind-numbingly episodic. The acting was excrutiatingly actorly. The transitions audibly clunked. Thankfully we have this to look forward to tonight. All hail bow-hunting! He is too still famous. He was on that show . No he didn't sing . . . but yes somewhere deep down and unforgivably corny I wish he had. When The Littlewomedievalist and I watched The Village Thurdsay night I kept thinking (and, yes, saying) &quot;This is exactly like Octavia Butler's book Clay's Ark .&quot; So last night Insomnia and I re-read Clay's Ark and came to a consensus: I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. The whole night he kept looking at me with his what-the-fuck-are-you-talking-about eyes. I shrugged my shoulders and professed idiocy. 'Cause really . . . those two couldn't be more different. Stop hounding me already. I can only check my email ever so often. Fine. I give up. The other three people on the panel are WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU AND WHAT YOU DOING IN MY OFFICE?!? IS THAT A KNIFE!?! WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</span></a></div>
