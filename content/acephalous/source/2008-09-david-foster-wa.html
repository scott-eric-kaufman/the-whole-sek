			<p>Of an apparent suicide, according to <a href="http://www.edrants.com/david-foster-wallace-dead/">Ed Champion</a>.&nbsp; <em>Los Angeles Times</em> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-wallace14-2008sep14,0,246155.story">confirms</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>CR’s <a href="http://adswithoutproducts.com/2008/09/14/dfw/">reaction</a>
nails mine.&nbsp; Wallace was a brilliant, unpredictable author whose next
book always could’ve been—what I mean to say, if Philip Roth dies, I’ll
be upset, but it wouldn’t tie my stomach in knots.&nbsp; Roth’s entered the
late-James stage of his career—his works refine and distill and what
readers expect from them.&nbsp; With Wallace, there was still potential—his
next book could’ve been another <em>Infinite Jest</em>, his next story could’ve been utterly unlike <em>Oblivion</em>, his next article could’ve done to McCain what Wallace’d done to lobsters.&nbsp; In short, his unwritten work could’ve been <em>differently brilliant</em>.</p>

<p>Thoughts on suicide from a man who’s already committed it, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316010766/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Oblivion</em></a>’s “Good Old Neon”:</p>
<blockquote><p>I simply said, without going into anything like the
level of detail I’ve given you (because my purpose in the letter was of
course very different), that I was killing myself because I was an
essentially fraudulent person who seemed to lack either the character
or the firepower to find a way to stop even after I’d realized my
fraudulence and the terrible toll it exacted . . . I also inserted that
there was also a good possibility that, when all was said and done, I
was nothing but another fact-track yuppie who couldn’t love, and that I
found the banality of this unendurable, largely because I was evidently
so hollow and insecure that I had a pathological need to see myself as
somehow exceptional or outstanding at all times. Without going into
much explanation or argument, I also told Fern that if her initial
reaction to these reasons for my killing myself was to think I was
being much, much too hard on myself, then she should know that I was
already aware that that was the most likely reaction my note would
produce in her, and had probably deliberately constructed the note to
at least in part prompt just that reaction, just the way my whole life
I’d often said and done things designed to prompt certain people to
believe that I was a genuinely outstanding person whose personal
standards were so high that he was far too hard on himself, which in
turn made me appear attractively modest and unsmug, and was a big
reason for my popularity with so many people in all different avenues
of my life . . .” (173)</p></blockquote>
<p>Of this story, Dan Green <a href="http://noggs.typepad.com/the_reading_experience/2004/08/reviewers_of_da.html">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>At its core, “Good Old Neon” is indeed a story about a
story, although we don’t know that until its conclusion. We do then
discover, however, that “Good Old Neon” has been an impersonation by
“David Wallace” of one of the latter’s high school classmates who died
in a “fiery single-car accident he’d read about in 1991,” an attempt by
the fictionalized author of <em>Oblivion</em> to “imagine what all
must have happened to lead up to” that crash, why someone “David
Wallace had back then imagined as happy and unreflective and wholly
unhaunted by voices telling him that there was something deeply wrong
with him that wasn’t wrong with anybody else and that he had to spend
all his time and energy trying to figure out what to do and say in
order to impersonate an even marginally normal or acceptable U.S. male”
would drive into a bridge abutment.</p>
<p>It is a wholly convincing impersonation, and emotionally charged in
a way we perhaps don’t expect from David Foster Wallace. And it is
precisely in the act of “baring the device”—the story self-reflexively
disclosing that it is indeed a story—that “Good Old Neon” produces its
greatest emotional effect. For in addition to the genuine human feeling
for the distress of its imagined protagonist the story encourages in
us, even more compelling is the revelation that it was some such
feeling on its author’s part that led “David Wallace” to write the
story in the first place.</p></blockquote>

<p>The quoted bit from <i>Oblivion</i> is throwing me irresistibly into self-narrative mode.  Well, what the hell -- why be a bad poet unless you are going to maunder on about yourself?  So here it is:</p>

<p><br />
On Hearing Of Another Death</p>

<p>I&#39;d never kill myself<br />
The love of dear people, their aging and growing up<br />
The hate of those creeps who I&#39;m going to see go down<br />
Love tattooed on one lobe,  hate on the other<br />
Attached, non-Buddha-fashion, I will laugh at the last<br />
I&#39;ve told my partner not to turn me off even as a vegetable<br />
Attached to life support, machines bleeping<br />
I&#39;ll lie there in the way, bankrupting somebody<br />
Hanging on by one last gurgle <br />
One last second of a dream</p></span>

The only element absent from Ari's post was the reaction of the rest of the country. The first chapter of Erik Larson's excellent recreation of Galveston's last hours, Isaac's Storm, reads: TELEGRAM Washington, D.C. Sept. 9, 1900 To: Manager, Western Union Houston, Texas Did you hear anything about Galveston? Willis L. Moore We already know the answer---in 1900, everyone was confused. On Wednesday, September 4th, the Louisville-based Christian Observer reported that &quot;all the great damage done to the roads [in Puerto Rico] by the hurricane of August 8, 1899, has been repaired.&quot;[1] By the time anyone read that article, the pluperfect had supplanted the perfect: another nameless storm had already slammed into the island and re-destroyed its infrastructure. The New York Times tracked the storm in its daily weather bulletins: For those of you with eyes like mine, I'll transcribe the important bits: September 5: &quot;The tropical storm was moving over Western Cuba in a northerly direction last night, and had increased somewhat in intensity. It has thus far caused rains through a portion of Cuba, and brisk to high northeasterly winds, which have extended as far north as Jupiter, Fla.&quot; September 6: &quot;The tropical storm was central last night near Key West, Fla., and has increased greatly in intensity. It has caused northeast gales over Southern Florida, and is moving slowly northward. The storm will cause high winds and general rains over the eastern portion of the country, and will probably terminate the high temperature period.&quot; It's in poor taste to mock forecasts before the Live StormTrack 8000 Triple Doppler Radar Slaves™ made it to Moline, so I won't say a word---I'll italicize theirs instead: September 7: &quot;The tropical storm continued slowly northwestward, and was apparently central last night over the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, and has still a tendency toward a northwesterly direction. Note how on September 6th, &quot;The Weather&quot; columnist---for the sake of clarity, I'll pretend one person's responsible---confidently declares the storm's &quot;moving slowly northward.&quot; He's pinpointed the speed and direction of the storm and stated them in no uncertain terms. Now, note how on September 7th, this same person rewrites the history it mis-predicted: saying the storm &quot;continued slowly northwestward&quot; creates the impression it has been and &quot;still&quot; is headed &quot;northwesterly.&quot; But it hasn't and it ain't. It's &quot;apparently&quot; headed northwesterly now, but under what or whose power? Where before the storm moved, now it exhibits a &quot;tendency&quot; to intercardinal &quot;directions.&quot; As you've no doubt guessed, &quot;The Weather&quot; is not the kind of column that requires flair. The tone of a typical column resembles a bureaucrat's notion of a copy-editor who writes with the brio of a type-setter. The party (or parties) who composed &quot;The Weather&quot; were, after all, forced to translate the daily bulletin compiled by The Divison of Telegrams and Reports for the Benefit of Commerce and Agriculture. If you spy...</span></a></div>

Jonah Goldberg’s modest opinion of his own work: It is a very serious, thoughtful, argument that has never been made in such detail or with such care. Jonah Goldberg’s serious, thoughtful argument about John McCain’s time in a North Vietnamese prison, presented in detail and with care: The reason he doesn’t send email is that he can’t use a keyboard because of the relentless beatings he received from the Viet Cong in service to our country. Not that I expect any better, but if you’ve written about a war between North and South Vietnam, shouldn’t you know the difference between North and South Vietnam?</span></a></div>
