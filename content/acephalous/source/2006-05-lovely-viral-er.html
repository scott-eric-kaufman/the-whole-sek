Let me weave a few conversations together here: CR: &quot;I have found that the closer that I keep to the issues that are actually important to me, what keeps me up at night thinking and reading and writing, the happier I am and, so far, the better I do. The trick, as is always the trick in intellectual production, is adapting what is most authentically mine to what the market demands.&quot; Laura: &quot;But my point is that you’re wrong to claim that love must end before 'pointed interest' (which I take to be the most you think a professional critic ought to own up to) can begin. You’ve every right to say there’s no place for love in your personal experience of writing about literature, and perhaps even within the culture of your institution, but there are no grounds for asserting that it’s also how things must work for everybody else. Reasoned, communicable academic scholarship and criticism is perfectly compatible with love, warmth, pleasure, curiosity, respect and enjoyment. I would even go so far as to say the very best criticism must harbour some sympathy for the object of its attention. It’s a negative capability thing. Marco Roth: &quot;It seems to me that an interesting debate could be had about the idea of love implied in the essay. Can’t we go from love of a single author to love of styles that remind us of our first love? Can the circle of our affections widen without betraying us to pseudo-science? But surely the purpose of a profession ought to have some relationship to the reasons people have for entering it. And—thinking psychologically rather than professionally—what does actually happen in English departments?&quot; Now thrust this all into the intellectual environment of an English department during graduate study and witness love's ideal evolution: You come to graduate school with love. You're forced to adapt that love to professional ends, preferably without soiling or despoiling it, in order to survive graduate school. You take your professionalized love to the MLA and hope that it enhances your performance and increases the odds that you'll land a job you can stomach. You land such a job and allow that love to guide your intellectual development for the rest of your days. Somewhere beneath that professional veneer your first love continues to inform the work. The formal properties of the academic article deaden interest in their content. Love enlivens the tired form. It inflates the flattened prose and communicates to the reader its contagion. Case in point. Now I'm gonna read Shakespeare. Why? Greenblatt...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/the_new_republi.html"><span><strong>Beloved?  Meh.  It Could've Been Important</strong> [Now new and x-posted!] The New Republic's &quot;This Week in the Arts&quot; mailer suggested that since &quot;The New York Times recently proclaimed Toni Morrison's Beloved to be 'the single best work of American fiction published in the past 25 years,'&quot; I should check out how TNR reviewed back in 1988. A quick dip in the archives and I was reading &quot;Aunt Medea.&quot; It opens with a misguided slam of James Baldwin. In stunning prose, Baldwin claims people who cannot suffer can never grow up, can never discover who they are. That man who is forced each day to snatch his manhood, his identity out of the fire of human cruelty that rages to destroy it knows, if he survives his efforts, and even if he does not survive it, something about himself and human like that no school on earth—and, indeed, no church—can teach. Baldwin may not always be correct, but few sound so good being wrong. According to TNR's reviewer, with Baldwin the claim to martyrdom, real or merely asserted, began to take on value. One on longer had to fear the charge of self-pity when detailing the suffering of one's group. Catastrophic experience was elevated. Race became an industry. It spawned careers, studies, experts, college departments, films, laws, hairdos, name changes, federal programs, and so many books. Then came the feminists. They exposed the patriarchial assumptions of black male protest literature. But exposing the shortcomings in protest writing by black men didn't automatically make writing by black women any better. Writers like Alice Walker revealed little more than their own inclination to melodrama, militant self-pity, guilt-mongering and pretensions to mystic wisdom. Enter Toni Morrison: With Song of Solomon, which appeared in 1979, she became a best-selling novelist, proving that the combination of poorly digested folk materials, feminist rhetoric, and a labored use of magic realism could pay off. Beloved is no better: It is designed to placate sentimental feminist ideology, and to make sure that the vision of black woman as the most scorned and rebuked of the victims doesn't weaken. For Beloved, above all else, is a blackface holocaust novel. It seems to have been written in order to enter American slavery into the big-time martyr ratings contest, a contest usually won by references to, and works about, the experience of Jews at the hands of Nazis. That Morrison chose to set the Afro-American experience in the framework of collective tragedy is fine, of course. But she lacks a true sense of the tragic. For all the memory within this book, including recollections of the trip across the Atlantic and the slave trading in the Caribbean, no one ever recalls how the Africans were captured. That would have complicated matters. That's not a bad point. Erasing the role of Africans in the slave trade is a matter of political pragmatism which does strip some formal element of tragedy from the slave trade. Wouldn't it be far more tragic to be sold into slavery by your cousin. Better...</span></a></div>
