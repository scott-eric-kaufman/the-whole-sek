<p>In the lot more money,lot more fans category, Goldberg still has a long way to go to catch up with our girl Britney, who&#39;s also ten times as laid-back, down-to-earth, and TV watching. Can&#39;t argue with success!</p>

<p>Britney&#39;s heterosexual, and unlike Goldberg, fertile too. Get on it, Jonah!</p></span>

<p>What&#39;s awesome, Herzog, is that you display the same diligence in making an argument that Jonah does: namely, none. You care to respond to any of the points made here--for example, Jonah&#39;s laziness about Herbert Spenser--or any number of the posts <a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a> by someone--and I know expertise makes you people gag--who&#39;s, wait for it, an EXPERT in fascism? </p></span>

If you start with Goldberg, you can&#39;t then branch to a reasonable discussion about WBM, even if a reasonable discussion about WBM was clearly possible with the same group of people.  In this case the context operates through the &quot;basically makes the same argument&quot; phrase, which will alternately make people deride WBM for the manifest ridiculousness of Goldberg and make people defend WBM against any connection with the manifest ridiculousness of Goldberg.  But nothing in WBM is really about Goldberg.</p>

What he seems to doing instead is using eugenics as a launching pad for arguing that bussing and affirmative action are the modern version of the creation and liquidation of the Łódź ghetto.  Among other things this is an interesting version of the contemporary conservative rallying cry, &quot;Let&#39;s refight the 70s!&quot;</p></span>

I wrote my dissertation on Kant, and other ethicists have come to me asking what Kant means with so-and-so, explain Kant&#39;s derivation of the categorical imperative to me, etc. I never thought they weren&#39;t real scholars. So for Goldberg to ask people about Herbert Spencer--well, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s crazy. Academics do it all the time, so why can&#39;t Goldberg? I haven&#39;t read his book, though; does he have a whole chapter about Herbert Spencer? </p>

<p>Incidentally, sek, I wrote a dissertation that was rather revisionary about one part of Kant&#39;s corpus; in fact, I think everybody but me is wrong about this part of Kant&#39;s thought. Yet I can see how, if someone asked me about it, and I told him what I thought, and he said, &quot;no one else has said it like this&quot; and I said &quot;well, that&#39;s because everyone else is wrong&quot; ... well, I can see why he&#39;d be suspicious. </p></span>

<p>Thanks for the response. Sometimes they wanted me to save 3-4 hours of work, but only where the reference to Kant wasn&#39;t really necessary for their point -- it was really because they knew Kant had street cred with philosophers and wanted to see whether they could include him as for or against their project. </p></span>

There is no polite way to to refuse, but I tend to think that you should not help these people.  This is partly because in this case they&#39;re missing the entire intellectual point (to my mind the point of reading Kant is the exercize of reading Kant), but also because, at a certain point, you&#39;re essentially abetting someone else&#39;s intellectual dishonesty.</p></span>

<p>I have posted a review of this sorry excuse for a book at Amazon, and hope you don&#39;t mind that I appropriated your description for my title.  Attributed, of course.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IZJNOKCSQ31T/ref=cm_cr_pr_cmt?%5Fencoding=UTF8&ASIN=0385511841#wasThisHelpful" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IZJNOKCSQ31T/ref=cm_cr_pr_cmt?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0385511841#wasThisHelpful</a></p>

<p>I notice some twit responded that you go by your middle name and somehow that is evidence of something. Or maybe it&#39;s Spencer who goes by his middle name?  Or ... huh?</p>

<p><br />
Hope you get around to posting a review.  It should be dynamite.</p>

Try Conservative Fascism (Very Seriously Thoughtful, Dripping with Unprecedented Care and Detail)</strong> In the wake of the success of fellow Jew Jonah Goldberg, I've decided to quote-mine my way into a publishing deal with a reputable firm. My thesis: Bush is not only a fascist, he is the direct ideological heir to the fascist, Benito Mussolini. We begin (where else?) in Iraq: &quot;Italian Oil Group Fight Iraqui Grant,&quot; New York Times, 30 September 1930 The stakes are the rich and as yet unexploited oil fields of Iraq, and the contestants are the present holders of an exclusive concession ... and an entirely new international oil group in which the guiding genius is understood to be Benito Mussolini. The troops? As of 9/11, they'll be there indefinitely: &quot;Long Occupation Indicated,&quot; New York Times, 12 September 1923 ROME, Sept. 11 -- All present indications are that it will be a long time before the Italian troups evacuate. It is obvious that bringing the ... murders to justice must be a long and difficult if not impossible task. Two weeks have elapsed since the crime was committed ... It is considered doubtful whether the ... If the real murderers are not found it is improbable that the Italian troops will ever evacuate. Like Bush, Mussolini believed the free market can do anything the government do, only better and more efficiently: &quot;Mussolini Greets Business Congress, Tells the Delegates Paternalism Must Go and Capitalism Will Stay,&quot; New York Times, 19 March 1923 &quot;It is my conviction,&quot; said Signor Mussolini in his address, &quot;that the State must renounce its economic functions, especially those of a monopolistic character, for which it cannot provide. The Government must give free play to private enterprise, and must forego any measures of State control and State paternalism. Such measures may satisfy the demagogy and ambitions of Socialists, but as shown by experience, will in the long run turn out to be absolutely fatal to the interests and economic development of any country.&quot; &quot;I do not believe the complex of forces which is known by the name of capitalism is about to end, as has for so long been announced by several extreme Socialist thinkers. Events have shown that all systems which interfere with initiative and individual impulse fail more or less in a short lapse of time. Like any neoconservative, inchoate or not, Mussolini wanted to privatize everything in sight: &quot;Mussolini Starts Drastic Reforms,&quot; New York Times, 3 November 1922 [T]he State will sell or lease to private enterprises all the State monopolies ... These include the parcel post, the telegraph, and the railways. He and Bush share a hatred of the Ivory Tower and a desire to defund the elitists who live in it: [T]he State will abolish ... all universities[.] And the poor are, of course, lazy. Something must be done about them: In any case [the State] will oblige the unemployed to go to the places where they can be usefully employed[.] Perhaps the army can usefully employ them? If not, there's always the other army, a.k.a. &quot;Mussolini's Blackwater&quot;: &quot;Fascisti...</span></a></div>

As I'm having to borrow the internet cable from someone currently using it to communicate with her students, until I resolve this issue (tomorrow) my online presence will be hit-or-miss. (I'll be doing the hitting thank you very much.) But! I hope to have this all resolved very shortly (tomorrow) and begin posting Very Seriously Intellectual items about funny books. I'm team-teaching a unit on Alan Moore's Watchmen the next two weeks for a course on the rhetoric of heroism. You're to be my test audience.* More shortly (tomorrow). *Awkward phrasing, I know, but far better than what I first wrote: &quot;You'll get the dry runs.&quot; This is what happens when you don't post for five days. All dissertation and no play makes SEK a poor writer.</span></a></div>
