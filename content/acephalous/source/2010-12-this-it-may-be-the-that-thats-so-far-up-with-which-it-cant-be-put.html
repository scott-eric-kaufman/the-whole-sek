He cites her two books on spirituality and hope, then says &quot;Having not read them, I can&#39;t say what it is --- spiritual or otherwise --- that animates her sense of grace, but it&#39;s not God.&quot; Read that again.</p>

<p>He comes to this conclusion, apparently, through several statements she made in public including rejecting the efficacy of intercessory prayer and emphasizing a focus on the rightness of our actions over a &quot;let&#39;s not piss off god&quot; fear-driven morality. I&#39;m paraphrasing, of course. </p>

<p>None of this in any way conflicts the possibility, and may well increase the probability in my opinion, that Elizabeth Edwards, of blessed memory, believed in God, in Christ, and in <i>the core Protestant tenets</i> of salvation through <i>the grace of God</i> by faith rather than through works. In other words, she was an entirely mainstream believing Christian who just didn&#39;t believe in magical prayer fairy dust to solve problems. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0147e07d8608970b-content"><p>Douglas is clearly an asshole and, despite his existence in some corner of the academy, not worth paying attention to.  Anyone who thinks that it is appropriate to judge the faith of someone else at the moment of their death is beyond tacky.  My monotheist friends keep telling me that that sort of thing is reserved for God, but apparently Douglas disagrees.</p>

<p>To Ahistoricality&#39;s point, however, I think Elizabeth Edwards was pretty clear in her <a href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_original_theology_of_elizabeth_edwards" rel="nofollow">public statements</a> that, while she still saw herself as a Christian and belonged to a Methodist church, she did not see her faith as a <i>mainstream</i> Christian one.  She came to her faith in a non-intercessory god in part based on childhood exposure to Buddhism, and in part based on her reflection on the death of her son.  The sort of God that could have saved him but chose not to was not one she felt she could worship or believe in.</p>

<p>I think that it&#39;s too her credit, and part of a larger legacy of maintaining her integrity in the face of public pressures and not allowing herself to be made a shallow political performer that she resisted the urge to simplify her faith and keep her doubt and deviations to herself.  That some religiuos bigots think otherwise just says something unfortunate about them.</p></span>

<p>JPool, I will defer entirely to your understanding of Edward&#39;s theological background, as it&#39;s a topic I&#39;ve never had any interest in before; I was just riffing on DD&#39;s incoherence. You&#39;re right about her dignified public role in that regard, absolutely.</p>

<p>That said, I don&#39;t understand - being Jewish is part of it, I guess - why a non-intercessory God wouldn&#39;t be considered a mainstream Protestant belief. Perhaps it&#39;s my historian&#39;s originalism: the whole point of Protestantism was getting away from an instrumental view of prayer and virtue. </p></span>

Certainly Protstantism could have developed a non-intercessory vision of God (Deism&#39;s God the watch maker or some sort of refinement of Calvism in which God preordains everything and so couldn&#39;t do anything except what they were already going to do after that), but that never caught on.  While some individuals and theologians disagree, my sense is the broad Protestant consensus is that God answers prayers, and that suggesting that God doesn&#39;t is stepping out on a far limb.</p></span>

While all this was happening her husband dishonored her by having a child with another woman and Elizabeth handled this as well. She already knew God does not always do what we want Him to do.  She knew she would now join her son and hoped for calm in her leaving 3 children behind.  I am sure she found what she was looking for in the end.  Mothers fight harder to live when they have young children.  I have seen this many times.  Problems in other parts of their life become meaningless.  The power within them is reserved for their children and to say she had loset or had no faith in God is far from the truth.  As adults we believe God can&#39;t give us things.  We have free will and can go in one direction or another without God saying &quot;Do this&quot;.  It makes no difference what we believe, we just hope there is a place to go to when we leave here.  She died with grace and that is what we will remember most.  We will not remember someone was an ass and should get his punishment for being one.</p></span>

My teeth. What happened — to my — tee-th.” Court it within shot of my ears – my ears – again, and the word whispered will be “death.” Two syllables, you see, not one, but two: “Death.” But not– not – before “pain.” Never before “pain.
