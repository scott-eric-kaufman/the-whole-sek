Most of these will concern technique–from sentence-level wit to large argumentative structure–and are there because I belong to the writing-as-perpetual-apprenticeship school. The only way to become a better writer is to imitate better writers, to work their prose over and under until you know it inside and out, and then to appropriate their techniques into your prose. *As White Bear and N. Pepperell noted, a little practice can be a dangerous thing–but I don't think that logic holds here. (By &quot;think&quot; I obviously intend &quot;hope.&quot;)" />

		<span id="comment-19146579-content"><p>Blah, I think the whole &quot;structuralism&quot; and &quot;poststructuralism&quot; phases have a little to do with that.  That said, I think the &quot;structure of feeling&quot; bit comes from Raymond Williams, but I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a single genesis point for &quot;structures of thought,&quot; outside the aforementioned affair with stucturalisms place and post-.  </p>

<p>CR, I don&#39;t see what you mean.  I think you can judge a lot about a scholar by his or her footnotes: thoroughness, for one; theoretical orientation, for another.  But more to the point, you can tell whether they argue with their source material or cite it authoritatively.  I can say, for example, that someone whose footnotes consist 90% of page references to Lacan will not be the sort of person who says something I think worth my time; whereas, to use a similar example, if someone&#39;s footnotes consist 90% of arguments with and/or about the application of Lacanian psychoanalysis to literary studies, I&#39;m likely to respect this scholar and, quite possibly, find some of what he or she has to say useful, even if said scholar self-identifies as a Lacanian.  In short, then, you can demonstrate intellectual honesty in footnotes, and since we don&#39;t know long we have on this earth / until our advisors demand a draft, everyone must find some way to prioritize.  This just so happens to be mine.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-19153509-content"><p>Sorry I jumped. I must have been in a bad mood. Not sure if I&#39;m in a better one because I stepped outside for a second and I think a bird shat on my head. Do birds fly at night? I doubt it was, like, an owl. Why don&#39;t I know this? I could have been a raindrop, but a really big and heavy raindrop. And there will be no shower tonite, as baby&#39;s asleep. Boo yah. </p>

<p>Anywho. You&#39;re OK. But there are two ways that people use the phrase &quot;reading for the footnotes.&quot; One is your way. But (and I&#39;m sure you know this but for the benefit of our studio audience) there&#39;s also a practice of judging journal articles on the basis of footnotic proflicness. I should know. The piece I&#39;m working on getting published came back last time from extremely prestigious / little read journal R with a reader&#39;s report that actually included a sentence that went something like, &quot;Now I know it&#39;s going to look like I&#39;m reading for the footnotes, but where is x, y, and z?&quot; It wasn&#39;t that my reader was making a case that there was something wrong with my article, just that it didn&#39;t touch the customary bases. In fact, the verdict boiled down, for this reader: &quot;Brilliantly done, but citationally deficient.&quot; Which is very frustrating. And lead me to revise the piece in the worst possible way: digging out the works of x, y, z, and maybe a,b, and c for good measure, and sprinkling the text with irrelevant footnotes and mini-paragraphs that start &quot;There, of course, has been much scholarly debate on the subject. X famously said...&quot; </p>

<p>I think the article will get published now, in a slightly-less / actually read journal D, now that I&#39;ve done the requisite name-dropping. But I really don&#39;t think my corrections have improved the piece. Certainly didn&#39;t add anything substantive to the argument. </p>

<p>This is the second time this has happened to me. The first time was a revise and resubmit. They yelled at me, called me sloppy, told me to look at some critics, I cut and pasted, and they were fabulously happy with the new version. No substantive changes at all. Window-dressing. Strawmen. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny. I think you and I had two very different sets of advisors. When I would tell mine about this, they would say things like &quot;fucking imbeciles! fuck them and their footnotes.&quot; Which, of course, explains the chip on my shoulder. Still, I wouldn&#39;t trade them for anything. Ultimately, this needs to be about something other than sub-discipinary circle jerking, ya know? </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s been beaten in to me enough that I&#39;ve pavlovianly gotten the picture, and have a cite-cite-cite tic going on that&#39;s fucking up my writing now a tiny bit. Footnote fetishism, which I&#39;ve never suffered from before. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-19222528-content"><p>That&#39;s pretty gross, CR. Is there some career point at which editors are allowed to assume that you know your field and you can focus on writing your piece without mashing  it up with an oral exam? Or is this just the way things stay when aiming at American academic journals? It&#39;s certainly a nasty habit to be forced into if you ever need to communicate with the outside world.<br />

<blockquote>*As White Bear and N. Pepperell noted, a little practice can be a dangerous thing–but I don&#39;t think that logic holds here.</blockquote>

<p>Eric, I take the opposite view.  &quot;Practice does [indeed] make perfect,&quot; as I am always telling my lover(s):  Practice, Practice, Practice!</p></span>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/abstractalous_m.html"><span><strong>Abstractalous Mission Statement</strong> One reason I've opened Abstractalous overwhelms all others: I'm terrible at quickly, cogently summarizing what I read. I belabor outlines until they're of equal or greater length than the article they're intended to supplant. That's not a useful skill. Re-writing an article or a chapter in so many different words doesn't help me remember the argument contained therein. So shortly before the accident, I started abstracting what I read in a deliberate fashion unseen since the days of qualifying exams. But I'm not good at it. I miss things. Big things. Things which lead others to believe I'm lying about having read the article. I think this the result of dissertation-scavenging for so long, but whatever its etiology, it must stop. Now. I have drawn the line, in the form of this blog, and I hope you find it as useful to read as I do to write. My purpose is two-fold: Get the argument right. Include all the important nuances. Establish its place in the critical tradition. Provide enough theoretical background so it makes sense to non-specialists. (Because someday you too will forget how to connect-the-dots of that subtle Derridian argument.) Focus on what the argument says, not criticisms of it. Too often the presence of criticism alongside fractures the argument itself. We can hash out the problems with the argument in the comments. The main body should be a direct, uncritical account of the argument in question. It should be the strong form of the argument, so that when we take up arms against it, we do not assail a man of straw. Create a resource for budding literary scholars. A catalog of abstracts they can turn to (or back to) when they need to understand a particular argument about a work of literature. To that end, I want these to be as direct (as per #1) and clearly written as possible. You're probably asking yourself: Why is he setting down these groundrules if he's going to be the only one writing it? Pish-posh. I don't think I'm that important. I also can't write an abstract for every book and/or article out there. I'm offering you the opportunity to help me out. Is your computer larded to the guts with abstracts of everything you've read the past five years? Why not post them? The information isn't proprietary, after all, since no one will ever publish your summaries of other people's publications. However, think of the status you could eventually acquire in the profession's reputation economy: you could be one of the few, the proud, the abstractors. People who took a little time every day to boil important arguments to the bone and put them up there for public consumption. I don't hold out too much hope that other people will agree to participate. But some of you already do something of the sort, so I'm still somewhat sanguine about my chances. But even if all my utopian desires are foiled, this should be a damn fine way for...</span></a></div>

One of the occupants of the apartment characterized its contents as &quot;four more funny books.&quot; &quot;She likes to call them that,&quot; said the other occupant, who asked he be referred to as &quot;Morning Person.&quot; &quot;Morning Person? He wakes up early three mornings in a row and now he's 'Morning Person'?&quot; said the other occupant, who then requested she be called &quot;Smell Good.&quot; &quot;Well, she does,&quot; Morning Person said. &quot;Writes perfume reviews and everything. Always talking about 'notes' and having me stick my nose in ornate bottles. But she's completely off-base about the funny books.&quot; The funny books in question contained materials Smell Good considered inappropriate for intelligent adults to consume. &quot;I walked in the room this morning and I saw a picture of Captain America,&quot; she said, referring to Marvel Comics' walking jingoism. &quot;And he was standing over a dead body screaming 'Do you think this &quot;A&quot; [on his forehead] stands for France?' Seriously, I mean, seriously.&quot; Morning Person refused to recant. &quot;Alright, Captain America said that, and my stomach turned too. But ten minutes later Hawkeye said he preferred to work alone because there was 'no showboating, no &quot;you think this A stands for France,&quot; no overgrown kids getting in their battle armor drunk.'&quot; &quot;What does that even mean?&quot; Smell Good replied. &quot;I can't take it anymore. Yesterday he tied a towel around his neck and insisted I call him 'The Multitasker' because he had 'the power' to watch television and surf the web simultaneously.&quot; Local residents responded to the dispute stoically. &quot;We know what goes on in there,&quot; a neighbor said. &quot;Which is more than enough to know that we don't want to get involved.&quot;</span></a></div>
