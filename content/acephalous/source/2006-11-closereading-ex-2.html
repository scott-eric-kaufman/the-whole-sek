			<p>[<em>This would be the third installment of my insanely close reading of Keats &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn.&quot;&nbsp; You can find the first <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/closereading_ex.html">here</a>, the second <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/closereading_ex_1.html">here</a>.&nbsp; I know some of you must be bored by now, but I must say I feel like a scientist who—having written the definitive treatise on the leaf—was handed a microscope and then—having written the definitive treatise on the cell—was handed an electron microscope, &amp;c.&nbsp; The more attention I pay the more the poem yields.&nbsp; I will, however, interleave other posts in with the Keats come tomorrow. For now, to the show again!</em>]</p>

<p>I open with a few more lines than before:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed<br />&nbsp; Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;<br />
And, happy melodist, unwearièd,<br />&nbsp; For ever piping songs for ever new;<br />
More happy love! more happy, happy love!</p></blockquote>

<p>Why?&nbsp; Happy you should ask!&nbsp; I cannot tell you how happy I am at this happy coincidence!&nbsp; It is a most happy, happy coincidence!&nbsp; Wait—what do you mean?&nbsp; I am <em>not</em> trying to hard.&nbsp; Does it <em>sound</em> like I'm trying to hard?&nbsp; Does not.&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>Does not!</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Does not!</strong></em></p>

<p>You may have a point.&nbsp; This stanza screams of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_nauseam"><em>argumentum ad nauseam</em></a>.&nbsp; You want something to mean what you think it should, you repeat yourself until no one cares to challenge you or—not to be topical or anything—until people begin to mumble your words under their breath as they stumble into pool halls and voting booths.&nbsp; In this example, the speaker <em>needs</em> you to believe the boughs are happy, happy with their perpetual plumage.&nbsp; Maybe they are.&nbsp; Maybe pain follows every leaf plucked by wind or wanton hand, and so the thought of keeping its foliage lushed and unplucked in perpetuity appeals to the bough.&nbsp; That, at least, is what the speaker assumes.&nbsp; Of course, since he anthropomorphizes the tree, I should have license to.&nbsp; Perhaps Spring is the deciduous equivalent of our awkward, teenage years.&nbsp; Perhaps every tree <em>dreads</em> the arrival of Spring, what with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budding#In_Horticulture">budding pains</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit#Simple_fruit">pericarpal outbreaks</a>—not to mention the inevitable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rot">heart rot</a>.&nbsp; Why should we assume that trees are happy in Spring?&nbsp; The Western Tradition?&nbsp; Is the one Keats and his speaker shared the same as the one the Roman potter and his clientele did?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Not necessarily.&nbsp; In diction, Keats and his speaker betray an aware of this.&nbsp; The boughs &quot;<em>cannot</em> shed&quot; their leaves.&nbsp; Not &quot;<em>will not</em> shed&quot; but <em>cannot</em>.&quot;&nbsp; Despite its overwhelmingly happy happiness, the tree has been <em>prevented</em> from acting, <em>prevented</em> from doing what it would do left to its own devices.&nbsp; Coupled with the coercive repetition, this characterization of an anthropomorphized tree seems cruel and unnecessary.&nbsp; Had the tree just been a tree, I wouldn't bother—but anthropomorphize it and its inclusion in the scene becomes disturbing.&nbsp; I suppose the attribution of agency hangs me up here, but with repeated readings that first line begins to resemble the words of a serial killer to his victim: </p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Tell me how happy you are.&nbsp; Tell me.&nbsp; You <em>are</em> happy, aren't you?&nbsp; Yes?&nbsp; Do you want the hose again?&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>At least the speaker was kind enough to specify that the happy melodist would pipe his song <em>unwearied</em>, as the alternative would fall prey to the logic of eternal life sans eternal youth.&nbsp; Even so, the speaker informs us that the piper'll be &quot;for ever piping songs <em>for ever new</em>.&quot;&nbsp; Novelty without remission sounds like my idea of the good life, let me tell you.&nbsp; Never to repeat the same song twice!&nbsp; Happy!&nbsp; To produce, without interruption, in endless succession, swinging new tunes!&nbsp; Happy!&nbsp; Happy!&nbsp; <em>For the love of Christ could someone please remind me how fucking happy I am?</em>&nbsp; Happy!&nbsp; Happy!&nbsp; Happy!</p>

<p>Putting aside the silliness momentarily, the note of insistence the speaker hits, hits then hits again lends a manic quality to the first half of this stanza.&nbsp; That last line segues from the &quot;happy&quot; repetition to the &quot;for ever&quot; repetition, which I'm not sure I understand.&nbsp; More and more of the &quot;happy, happy love&quot; will be:</p>

<blockquote><p>For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,<br />&nbsp; For ever panting, and for ever young;</p></blockquote>

<p>But for the panting, that sounds good—only I'm not sure who will experience this.&nbsp; The piper?&nbsp; One of the men, gods, maidens, pursued, pursuers, strugglers, escapers or musicians from the first stanza?&nbsp; The fair youth or his bold lover from the second?&nbsp; The melodist from this one?&nbsp; Does the &quot;Ode&quot; offer us enough information to make this determination?&nbsp; Probably not, for reasons <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/closereading_ex_1.html#comment-24921871">I explain here</a>.&nbsp; The speaker never provides enough context to connect those who appear—albeit disguised by the narrator's ignorance—in one stanza and those appear in the next.</p>

<p>Those last three lines, on the other hand, seem to echo the first three in ways I don't entirely understand right now.&nbsp; Nor will, before night ends.</p>

<p>That was hilarious. There is certainly the motif of sacrifice or even murder; that appears to be something Keats thinks aesthetic perception does to things by removing them from the flow of time. </p>

<p>One might read the forced joviality of Keats&#39;s repeated exclamations as an enactment of the difference between language (and, by extension, Thought) and image. In trying to reproduce the moment on the urn, he is forced by the diachronic nature of language into a shrill redundancy. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-25044514-content"><p>Well, you&#39;ve convinced me.  After reading the other parts of the analysis and the myriad comments, I feel like the poem is obviously saying what you think, and then some:</p>

<p>Part one IS saying that things are meaningfully aesthetic when you don&#39;t know what they really mean.  And comparing it ceaselessly to consummation.  No, really, imagining sex is better than actually doing it, and you should stay a virgin.  Aesthetically.  Always pursuing, always seeking to know, never able to get any closer at all to it, that&#39;s a good thing, sure it is.  Beauty IS truth.  </p>

<p>And then in all the repetition of happy, he&#39;s protesting too much.  (Shhhh!  He really does want to know what the vase meant to its creator, he wants to pierce the veil, the hymen, get laid...) but he knows he never will so he&#39;s going to keep insisting it&#39;s better to always want and never get - heck, it might make the vase boring if he knew, that&#39;d be tragic, this way it&#39;s forever mysterious and alluring to him - and hope he convinces himself.  He doesn&#39;t need to know.  Really, come on, you gotta believe, he doesn&#39;t.  He believes it.  Sure he does :)</p></span>

On to the show!] Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard Are sweeter... Are these lines baldly ekphrastic, in that the sounds of &quot;pipes and timbrels&quot; can't be depicted, only imagined? Or am I getting ahead of myself by assuming that the &quot;pipes and timbrels&quot; which close the first stanza play the melodies opening the second? I think I am. The second stanza reads like a theatrical aside—an excuse to indulge in a little Platonic digression on unheard melodies. Like the sound of a tree falling in the woods with no one around to hear it, these unheard melodies must exist independently of the minds which would otherwise perceive them. Or could the speaker be yoking Platonism to the aesthetic of ignorance? He imagines the sweet sounds produced by the pipers, but he has no idea what they actually sounded like. He assumes their sweetness, but for all he knows, those pipes could produce the brown note. Again, the speaker assembles the aesthetic from a collection of ignorant bits. ...therefore, ye soft pipes, play on; Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd, Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone: The speaker implores the pipers to play on in silence. Only, not exactly silence. One can and should still listen to &quot;spiritual ditties of no tone.&quot; What does that mean? According to the OED, in Keats' time the word &quot;ditty&quot; referred to &quot;the words of a song, as distinguished from the music or tune.&quot; This definition threatens to spiral that fifth line into utter oxymoron. The ancient world being short Sambora's talk box, the idea of piping words through pipes to spirits fails the laugh test—but it does engage the reader in a brutal ekphrastic exercise about how the depictions of sounds on the urn relate to the words used to describe them. Instead of moving through two distinct media—difficult enough—the speaker compels us to navigate three. Moreover, the speaker suggests the pipers pipe their impossible ditty sans &quot;tone.&quot; What he means by &quot;tone&quot; here is complicated by the &quot;ditties&quot; which lack it, but be the it musical or linguistic, the word still refers to the uniqueness of the phrasing. Why would the speaker want a tone which lacks distinctness? I'm not sure, and to be frank, this entire section of the stanza staggers me like sharp blows to the head, so I'm tabling this discussion for now. I'll return to it when it ceases to produce stars. With line fifteen, the speaker offers a repreive from dizzying ekphrasis: Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave Thy song... Stop. What is being described here? A fair youth beneath multiple trees? Is he one of the first stanza's &quot;men or gods&quot; in &quot;mad pursuit&quot; or &quot;struggling to escape&quot; with &quot;pipes and timbrels&quot;? Are we still looking at the same frieze, or have we moved onto...</span></a></div>

By your permission I lay before you, in a series of letters, the results of my researches upon beauty and art. I am keenly sensible of the importance as well as of the charm and dignity of this undertaking. I shall treat a subject which is closely connected with the better portion of our happiness and not far removed from the moral nobility of human nature. I shall plead this cause of the beautiful before a heart by which her whole power is felt and exercised ... (Read more...) Letter II. But I might perhaps make a better use of the opening you afford me if I were to direct your mind to a loftier theme than that of art ... I hope that I shall succeed in convincing you that this matter of art is less foreign to the needs than to the tastes of our age; nay, that, to arrive at a solution even in the political problem, the road of aesthetics must be pursued, because it is through beauty that we arrive at freedom. But I cannot carry out this proof without my bringing to your remembrance the principles by which the reason is guided in political legislation. (Read more...) Letter V. Does the present age, do passing events, present this character? I direct my attention at once to the most prominent object in this vast structure ... (Read more...) Letter VI. Have I gone too far in this portraiture of our times? I do not anticipate this stricture, but rather another—that I have proved too much by it ... (Read more...) Letter VII. Can this effect of harmony be attained by the state? That is not possible, for the state, as at present constituted, has given occasion to evil, and the state as conceived in the idea, instead of being able to establish this more perfect humanity, ought to be based upon it. Thus the researches in which I have indulged would have brought me back to the same point from which they had called me off for a time ... (Read more...) Letter VIII. Must philosophy therefore retire from this field, disappointed in its hopes? Whilst in all other directions the dominion of forms is extended, must this the most precious of all gifts be abandoned to a formless chance? Must the contest of blind forces last eternally in the political world, and is social law never to triumph over a hating egotism? (Read more...) Letter IX. But perhaps there is a vicious circle in our previous reasoning! Theoretical culture must it seems bring along with it practical culture, and yet the latter must be the condition of the former ... (Read more...) Letter X. Convinced by my preceding letters, you agree with me on this point, that man can depart from his destination by two opposite roads, that our epoch is actually moving on these two false roads, and that it has become the prey, in one case, of coarseness, and elsewhere...</span></a></div>
