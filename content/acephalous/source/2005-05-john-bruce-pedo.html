				<p>*I'm using the newly patented <em>John Bruce Quotation System</em>, in which the mention of a word/phrase constitutes an admission of being or believing said word/phrase.&nbsp; And that word/phrase need not even be said by the person you're accusing, so long as someone they've quoted has said it!&nbsp; Like &quot;pedophile,&quot; which John Bruce has never himself written, but someone he's quoted has.&nbsp; Can you guess who?&nbsp; That's part of the fun!&nbsp; You can make anyone say anything!&nbsp; It's awesome and not at all intellectually irresponsible!&nbsp; </p>

<p>**I've already checked his site 9,851,051 times today.&nbsp; I encourage you to do the same, since he lives for his hits...and do make sure to drop a line, tell him where you came from and what you think about him.&nbsp; I know he'd appreciate it, because for John Bruce, it's better to be laughed at by everyone than listened to by none. </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">[Disclaimer: Unlike John Bruce, who thinks this sort of selective quotation acceptable practice, I don't believe pasting people's words together and willfully misinterpreting them means that these people are, say, or believe what I've attributed to them.&nbsp; John Bruce isn't, to my knowledge, a pedophile/murderer/etc., but he is an ass, an extraordinary ass, and turnabout is fair play.]</span><br /> </p>

		<span id="comment-5961211-content"><p>I too am going to stop posting comments on John Bruce&#39;s site - because, as a certain e-mailer, much wiser than me, pointed out, he is in fact a pathetic figure more worthy of pity than scorn.  However, as a parting shot, I recently found a comment by Mary McCarthy which perfectly sums up why, for me, John Bruce is so annoying.  McCarthy, alluding to Kant, distinguishes between stupidity and mere idiocy:</p>

<p>&quot;Stupidity is caused, not by brain failure, but by a wicked heart.  Insensitiveness, opacity, inability to make connections, often accompanied by low &#39;animal&#39; cunning.  One cannot help feeling that this mental oblivion is chosen, by the heart or the moral will - an active preference, and that explains why one is so irritated by stupidity, which is not the case when one is dealing with a truly backward individual.&quot;</p></span>

According to the blurb, Although Boris Karloff is best known in the Unites States for his horror film roles, he was a classically trained actor with a distinguished stage and film career. His voice and articulation are perfect for these tales: soothing and emotive, suspenseful at just the right places. A 6-year-old listener was as captivated as the reviewer... A six-year old &quot;captivated&quot; by Boris Karloff. I think I've seen this one before. And am I the only person having a hard time imagining Karloff as the narrator of the 1966 television version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas! or does this belong in the category of pop-culture trivia everybody else digested long ago? (And before anyone asks, I'm hard at work dissertating. I amazoned--if one can &quot;google,&quot; one can &quot;amazon&quot; and also probably &quot;imdb,&quot; although we'll probably need a new class of phonemes to pronounce that puppy--the Kipling because I'm tired [as are my eyes] of staring at the just-crisp-enough-to-read but blurry-enough-to-suspect-I-need-new-glasses .pdf of the originals in Ladies Home Journal.)</span></a></div>

I've taken to saving posts as drafts and then never publishing them, thinking that I'll one day have time to edit them with the attention they deserve. What I've got in the queue right now are: one from the archives about the conspicuous absence of Darwin and evolutionary thought from the polygamy debates in the 1890s (and this isn't a silly &quot;male-male eroticism is absent from the work of anchoresses&quot; article, but a serious and amusing look at the extent to which both sides in the polygamy debate avoided anything that might possibly lead to the mention of Darwin and his magical wonderful theory of evolution) a look at the treatment of new historicism in Theory's Empire in which I come to the conclusion that I'm not the new historicist I thought I was, but am one of the other ones, the ones with the white hats and wits about them an increasingly long commentary on The Orchid Thief that I'll post after I teach it (lest the ideas get too concretized to allow me the intellectual flexibility I need to run a smooth, productive discussion) another installment of A. Cephalous' Refutin' and Rebutin' Walter Benn Michaels Travelin' Extravaganza an utterly random post about the way David Simon's Homicide changed the way literary journalists write about group dynamics Soon as any of 'em done to my satisfaction, you'll see 'em up here bells, whistles and all. Until then, I take my leave of you, dear readers. P.S. I'm also done with John Bruce. As easy and entertaining as it is to kick the boy, people whose opinions I respect have informed me that not only has he been down, he is down, and he'll remain down for the foreseeable future. That being the case, kicking him for comedy ain't becoming. So I'm done.</span></a></div>
