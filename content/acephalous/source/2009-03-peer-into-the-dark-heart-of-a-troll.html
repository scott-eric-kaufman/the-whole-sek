First, check out the posters to the right. Look familiar? And isn't that Mr. and Mrs. Wayne at the back entrance of the opera, being saved from a bloody death? And . . . the opera bills say: &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (The Bat). So can we safely come to the conclusion that the original Nite Owl stopped Batman from popping up in their universe? No. If we could, there wouldn't be a poster for a comic book? film? play? radio serial? starring Batman in the background. There is Batman-themed entertainment in this universe. (And if the opera being exited by the Waynes is Die Fledermaus, Snyder alludes not to Batman lore but Batman Begins. Scratch that. The opera in Batman Begins is Mefistofele.) The larger problem with this scene neatly encapsulates the larger problem with Snyder's aesthetic. He is faithful in act but not in spirit. His heart sins. In Watching the Watchmen, Dave Gibbons says outright what every careful reader of the novel already knew: I mentioned to [Alan Moore] the idea of pirate comics, reasoning that a world with real superheroes would have no need of them in comics. Alan later took that throwaway idea and constructed an entire allegorical narrative from it within the main story. So why did Snyder include an advertisement for some sort of Bat-themed entertainment in the credit sequence? Because it would be cool. Who cares if it violates the fundamental narrative logic of the work Snyder purports to love?</span></a></div>

I’m more curious about this: I was fortunate to be mentored by Corrine Glesne, an absolutely wonderful ethnographer (Busier et al., 1997; Glesne, 1989, 1998, 2003; Martin &amp; Glesne, 2002). Do my eyes deceive me, or are those citations meant to substantiate the absolute wonderfulness of Corrine Glesne? Is this a cheap scheme to up the number of times people are cited in professional indexes? If so, how is it nobody’s—wait a minute. I just had an idea. Have I ever told you how awesome you are? I haven’t? Well then, it’s about time that I did. It is my professional opinion that you are awesome. By the authority invested in me by the University of California, I hereby declare that each and every one of you possess more awesomeness than anyone has any right to. You can quote me on that. In fact, I insist that you do. Every time you appeal to your academic ethos, I’d like to see some variation of “Lest you doubt my authority, remember that reputable scholars have attested to my awesomeness (Kaufman 2009).” Feel free to practice in the comments. For obvious reasons, I will x-post this everywhere. The more citations I score, the more reputable I become; and the more reputable I become, the more my stamp of approval’s worth. I think we have ourselves a win-win scenario here. So what are you waiting for? Start practicing already!</span></a></div>
