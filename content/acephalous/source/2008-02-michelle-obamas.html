        <meta name="description" content="Travis Kavulla has some &quot;Thoughts on Michelle Obama's Thesis.&quot; As his title suggests, they are neither smart nor sound thoughts: they are merely thoughts. Kavulla is not a dumb man. He may even be a nice man. So I grant, for the moment, that his thoughts on Michelle's Obama's thesis represent neither his mind nor his character; because if they did, they would speak quite poorly of both. First and foremost, the object of his critique is an undergraduate thesis. It is not written deliberately—with the care a graduate student would write a seminar paper or a law student compose a sample brief—but in bursts of research crammed in between unrelated coursework. (No scholar works on a paper while simultaneously trying to master studentized range distributions and Bowen's reaction series.*) So undergraduate theses tend to resemble fun-house reflections of their committee's interests. For example, remember my undergraduate thesis? Were someone to dredge it up when my wife went up for tenure on the assumption it reflected my current beliefs and standards, I would dismiss them as frivolous. My senior thesis is the product of an immature mind warping John Protevi's passion for continental philosophy into an embarrassing melange of big words and bad ideas. Like any successful undergraduate, I could outline [.pdf] other people's thoughts but had problems generating any of my own. So I did what every undergraduate does: I mimicked. I experimented. I minced the careful prose of my betters until it emitted a fragrance I thought odoriferous, everyone else odorous. But I've changed. In the years since I wrote my undergraduate thesis, I've learned how to parrot the conventions of my betters more convincingly, and that research consists of more than finding a theory that conveniently accounts for what I've already determined to be very important facts. In short, I've honed the skills I once wielded with all the subtlety of toddler with a broadsword. Now for the ironic part: I'd still be an oversized infant struggling to hack with a sword twice as wide as he was tall were it not for one of Kavulla's co-bloggers. When I first arrived in Irvine, I talked BIG TALK. I impressed people with my manifest impressiveness. One day, after witnessing me conquer fellow graduate students in an after-seminar bull-session, a fellow by the name of Jim Zeigler pulled me aside and recommended I read Mark Bauerlein's Literary Criticism: An Autopsy. I was humbled. Not that I agreed (or agree) with Bauerlein, but the idea that someone was challenging the theoretical orthodoxy I'd come to believe sacred was exactly the corrective I needed. I'd uncritically embraced post-modern/post-structuralist theory as an undergraduate and needed some distance. I needed to read something like this: [&quot;Discourse&quot;] has a loaded meaning, but a vague referent, and the vagueness is necessary to this mode of inquiry.

			<p>Travis Kavulla has some &quot;<a href="http://phibetacons.nationalreview.com/post/?q=N2MzNzNjYmE0MmNkNzZiNDdjM2VkYmJmYmIwNjRlZmE=">Thoughts on Michelle Obama's Thesis</a>.&quot;&nbsp; As his title suggests, they are neither smart nor sound thoughts: they are merely thoughts.&nbsp; Kavulla is not a <a href="http://trust.gatesscholar.org/scholars2007/kavulla.asp">dumb man</a>.&nbsp; He may even be a nice man.&nbsp; So I grant, for the moment, that his thoughts on Michelle's Obama's thesis represent neither his mind nor his character; because if they did, they would speak quite poorly of both.&nbsp; </p>

<p>First and foremost, the object of his critique is <em>an undergraduate thesis</em>.&nbsp; It is not written deliberately—with the care a graduate student would write a seminar paper or a law student compose a sample brief—but in bursts of research crammed in between unrelated coursework.&nbsp; (No scholar works on a paper while simultaneously trying to master <a href="http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/intro_ANOVA.html">studentized range distributions</a> and <a href="http://csmres.jmu.edu/geollab/Fichter/RockMin/RockMin.html">Bowen's reaction series</a>.*)&nbsp; So undergraduate theses tend to resemble fun-house reflections of their committee's interests. </p>

<p>For example, remember <em>my </em><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/how_not_to_open.html">undergraduate thesis</a>?&nbsp; Were someone to dredge it up when my wife went up for tenure on the assumption it reflected my <em>current </em>beliefs and standards, I would dismiss them as frivolous.&nbsp; My senior thesis is the product of an immature mind warping <a href="http://proteviblog.typepad.com/">John Protevi</a>'s passion for continental philosophy into an embarrassing melange of big words and bad ideas.&nbsp; Like any successful undergraduate, I could <em><a href="http://www.protevi.com/john/DG/PDF/ATP10New2.pdf">outline</a> </em>[.pdf] other people's thoughts but had problems generating any of my own.&nbsp; So I did what every undergraduate does:</p>

<p>I mimicked.&nbsp; I experimented.&nbsp; I minced the careful prose of my betters until it emitted a fragrance I thought odoriferous, everyone else odorous.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But I've changed.&nbsp; In the years since I wrote my undergraduate thesis, I've learned how to parrot the conventions of my betters more convincingly, and that research consists of more than finding a theory that conveniently accounts for what I've already determined to be very important facts.&nbsp; In short, I've honed the skills I once wielded with all the subtlety of toddler with a broadsword.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Now for the ironic part:</p>

<p>I'd still be an oversized infant struggling to hack with a sword twice as wide as he was tall were it not for one of Kavulla's co-bloggers.&nbsp; When I first arrived in Irvine, I talked BIG TALK.&nbsp; I impressed people with my manifest impressiveness.&nbsp; One day, after witnessing me conquer fellow graduate students in an after-seminar bull-session, a fellow by the name of <a href="http://faculty.smu.edu/jzeigler/">Jim Zeigler</a> pulled me aside and recommended I read Mark Bauerlein's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812216253/diesekoschmar-20"><em>Literary Criticism: An Autopsy</em></a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I was humbled.&nbsp; Not that I agreed (or agree) with Bauerlein, but the idea that someone was challenging the theoretical orthodoxy I'd come to believe sacred was <em>exactly </em>the corrective I needed.&nbsp; I'd uncritically embraced post-modern/post-structuralist theory as an undergraduate and needed some distance.&nbsp; I needed to read something like this:</p><blockquote><p>[&quot;Discourse&quot;] has a loaded meaning, but a vague referent, and the vagueness is necessary to this mode of inquiry.&nbsp; In using it, critics can attenuate their descriptions, yet still sound authoritative.&nbsp; &quot;Discourse&quot; usage converts a methodological weakness into a theoretical exigency.&nbsp; &quot;Discourse&quot; is an essential constituent of inquiry, description, definition, and so an inquiry into any particular discourse must hold off from being too determinate, too positive.&nbsp; The ubiquitousness of discursive products (norms, values, distinctions, etc.) fosters a healthy skepticism toward the methods of empirical investigation (hypothesis testing, observation, fact-finding).&nbsp; Hence critics can make incidental citations of this and that discourse, the mention of them indicating a world of relevant sociopolitical processes, and rightly neglect to fill in the concrete sociopolitical ingredients of the discourses cited.&nbsp; The meaning of &quot;discourse&quot; and the methodological evanescence of it vindicate empirical thinness and oblique statement. (57)</p></blockquote><p>Before you ask: I'm only quoting the conclusion; Bauerlein shows his work in the book.&nbsp; Reading that forced me to refine my vague Foucauldian notion of what constituted &quot;discourse&quot; into something methodologically respectful ... something I couldn't use to lord over my fellows in a cloud of abstraction.&nbsp; I became a respectable scholar in graduate school.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Would that Kavulla could give Michelle Obama the benefit of that same doubt.&nbsp; <br /> </p><hr />

<p>Thanks ... I think.</p>

<p>John, </p>

<p>I defy you to find anything redeeming in it that&#39;s not <em>directly</em> attributable to your, Pat or Water&#39;s influence.</p>

<p>Ahistoricality, </p>

<p><em>Then I started blogging, and all hope of a political career was shot to hell!</em></p>

<p>You know, I&#39;ve been thinking about this in regards the market and tenure, and I wonder whether it&#39;s true.  You can just as easily overwhelm someone with oodles and oodles of facts, muddying the waters with, well, thousands of particles of silt.  (hilzoy&#39;s recent post detailing Clinton vs. Obama&#39;s legislative records comes to mind.  I mean, how many people do you think looked through all that?) </p></span>

<p>If you mean Hilzoy&#39;s posts, I did, actually. I thought it was a draw, mostly.</p>

<p>With regard to the larger point, though, it&#39;s true that you can sometimes overwhelm an unengaged audience (and many tenure/hiring committees qualify) with masses of acceptable if unexciting material, but engaged ones (and it seems like there&#39;s always <i>one</i> in a committee) will have certain things they&#39;re looking for -- what touches their interests, or inflames their passions. They will fix on those details and make snap decisions based on them, reinterpreting all the rest of the material in that light. And you never know what it is, usually: I&#39;ve seen job candidates derailed by offhand comments in a campus visit, things I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t remember saying. </p>

<p>Sometimes it&#39;s a good thing, obviously: you can make someone happy almost as quickly as you can make them unhappy. And we&#39;re approaching -- I fervently hope -- a tipping point where technological and public engagement will be seen as more of a positive than a negative. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-104209994-content"><p>I ran across your post by accident and had a good laugh. Your comments about undergraduates who trot out theoretical frameworks in order to justify their own perspectives hit close to home for me. I just finished my undergrad career a few weeks ago, and I spent the fall flinging Butler and Foucault at one of Cormac McCarthy&#39;s novels. I think I&#39;m very familiar with the topic you discuss, but I still would like to believe that what I wrote was solid.</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking of giving Bauerlein&#39;s book a read just to hear what he has to say. I did some digging, and read this, an article he wrote a few years ago. I think his book could be interesting:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/sample.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/sample.html</a></p>

<p>Thanks for pointing me to his book. I&#39;m looking forward to reading it.<br />

I find comfort in knowing other artists (and particularly a brilliant person like yourself), has had the same fears and stumbling blocks.  Sorry for commenting over a year after you posted this, but there is alot on this site to read, and I&#39;m a slow reader.</p></span>

Eaten by a Cylon, Thank You Very Much</strong> &quot;Scott's Dissertation&quot; is the name of a folder on my desktop. Has been for the past three years. When I migrated my files from my laptop, I copied &quot;Scott's Dissertation&quot; to the external hard drive (a.k.a.); then I copied it from the external hard drive (a.k.a.) to my my new desktop. I assumed my new &quot;Scott's Dissertation&quot; folder would contain all the files and folders housed in the old one. It doesn't. The &quot;Chapter One - Introduction&quot; folder is missing. It's not on the desktop. It's not on the external hard drive (a.k.a.). It's not on the laptop. I had no choice. The folder must've disappeared when I was migrating files. I had to consult the Cylon: What can I do you for? Remember that folder on the laptop with my first chapter in it? Yes. Any idea where it went? I ate it. You ate it? Did you need it for something? Hope not because I ate it. Why would you eat it? It was there so I ate it. And this was a good idea? Probably not. But it was there so I ate it. You would eat it too if it was there. I wouldn't. You would. Also: Bird. Bird? I look out my window and see the Cylon is correct. Atop my air conditioner sit two turtledoves. Their feathers are ruffled and they are looking directly at me. One cocks its head and charges. It pecks the window and looks to its left. The rails of my porch are obscured by a mob of irate turtledoves. You want to eat bird. No. You want to eat bird like I ate chapter. I don't. You lie. Turn in bird instead of chapter. I need chapters not birds. I can't turn in a bird. Why not? Advisers don't accept birds. They want chapters. Search committees don't consider birds. Jobs are not won on the strength of birds. I can't turn in a bird. Too bad. You go to war with the dissertation you have, not the dissertation you want.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/02/anonymity-doffs.html"><span><strong>Anonymity (Doffs, Tips a Macintosh)</strong> People disappear. They wake up Tuesday morning and decide it's better to be a no one somewhere else than some damn fool soul here. Happens all the time. You expect a familiar face and are greeted by a stranger with a story. &quot;He moved to Michigan.&quot; &quot;Michigan?&quot; &quot;To Dexter, I think. Not even a town. A village.&quot; &quot;What's in Dexter?&quot; &quot;A village. He wanted to live in one.&quot; Who could blame him? The living in hamlets ain't easy. (Settlements neither.) No one with any sense plants roots in unincorporated municipalities anymore. Why not abscond to villages distant and remote? Why not abandon the inessential and reinvent yourself somewhere pleasant? The appeal's as obvious as it is compelling: no one appreciates the person rank circumstance created. Everyone thinks they could be more given a fair shake in honest environs. Only everyone is wrong. Some people are destined to fail spectacularly. Doesn't matter where they move to or who with, in two months their straits choke desperate. They disappear into and become the Man in the Macintosh. This they desire, to be anonymous and unknown, to flit from mourner to mourner without explaining anything to anyone. Tortuous anonymity is palpable from space. (Even in Michigan.) Like Joyce I wonder who it is who makes this מנין sing: Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I'd like to know? Now, I'd give a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never dreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he could. Still he'd have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No ants too. First thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it. We all come to look at it eventually. Then we die. (cue earnest horns)</span></a></div>
