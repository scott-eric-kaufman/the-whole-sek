        <meta name="description" content="[Cross-posted . . . why do I even bother saying where anymore?] Sons only learn about their fathers obliquely. The rituals of father and son relations dictate an insurmountable formality which compels them to seek other avenues of understanding. For most of the 20th Century, those other avenues terminated in weekly sessions with other sons' fathers (and infrequently mothers) who would tell them about Oedipus' father (and unfortunate mother) and ask for payment in cash. For reasons which have more to do with the culture of analysis captured by Woody Allen than anything else, I associate this obsession with Freudian psychotherapy and unkempt beards with the 1970s. All of which I offer as introduction to the idea that Noah Baumbach, writer of the recently released The Squid and the Whale (2005) and the brilliant Kicking &amp; Screaming (1995), learned about his father through the fiction of his father, the novelist and short story writer Jonathan Baumbach. Why do I find this interesting? If Jonathan Baumbach's fiction is staunchly personal but ultimately fictional, then Noah Baumbach's depictions of the fathers of his characters don't refer to his father so much as the narrators of his father's fictions. In other words, the narrator of Jonathan's The Life &amp; Times of Major Fiction appears as the father in all of Noah's films. I originally thought I would land somewhere in the vicinity of &quot;Jonathan's narrators are autobiographical in an uncomplex fashion,&quot; at which point I could dismiss the artistry of Jonathan's novels and claim that Noah's depiction of Jonathan (played by '70s icon Elliot Gould) nailed him. But as I re-read The Life &amp; Times today I realized that argument would be facile in the extreme. Jonathan's obsessions can be catalogued with ease: pointless games imbued with meaning, the awkwardness of lives acrumbling, the divorces of the preternaturally witty and their relation to the kids' unconscious, and basketball. This particular constellation of interests appears both in the narratives of Jonathan's The Life &amp; Times and B. and Noah's Kicking &amp; Screaming. (And what, I ask, would Freud make of this family's obsession with ampersands?) In Noah's film, the viewer witnesses Gould attempt to connect with his estranged son through talk of the Knicks' failures and Patrick Ewing's failings. Grover, Noah's surrogate, belongs to a circle who fall out via an argument about the protocols of an improvised bar-room trivia game. Having read Jonathan's work, viewers of Noah's films cannot help but see a world limited by his father's obsessions—a Bloomian anxiety in extremis. Lest you think I desire diminishing the brilliance of my favorite film of the 1990s, I will add that I think this appropriation, intentional or not, an incredible glance into the relation of authors to their lives.

<p>Sons only learn about their fathers obliquely.&nbsp; The rituals of father and son relations dictate an insurmountable formality which compels them to seek other avenues of understanding.&nbsp; For most of the 20th Century, those other avenues terminated in weekly sessions with other sons' fathers (and infrequently mothers) who would tell them about Oedipus' father (and unfortunate mother) and ask for payment in cash.&nbsp; For reasons which have more to do with the culture of analysis captured by Woody Allen than anything else, I associate this obsession with Freudian psychotherapy and unkempt beards with the 1970s.&nbsp; All of which I offer as introduction to the idea that <a href="http://avclub.com/content/node/42407">Noah Baumbach</a>, writer of the recently released <em><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0367089/">The Squid and the Whale</a> </em>(2005) and the brilliant <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0113537/"><em>Kicking &amp; Screaming</em></a> (1995), learned about his father through the fiction of his father, the novelist and short story writer <a href="http://fc2.org/baumbach/baumbach.jpg">Jonathan Baumbach</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Why do I find this interesting?&nbsp; If Jonathan Baumbach's fiction is staunchly personal but ultimately fictional, then Noah Baumbach's depictions of the fathers of his characters don't refer to his father so much as the narrators of his father's fictions.&nbsp; In other words, the narrator of Jonathan's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=diesekoschmar-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932511082">The Life &amp; Times of Major Fiction</a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=diesekoschmar-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" /></em> appears as the father in all of Noah's films.&nbsp; I originally thought I would land somewhere in the vicinity of &quot;Jonathan's narrators are autobiographical in an uncomplex fashion,&quot; at which point I could dismiss the artistry of Jonathan's novels and claim that Noah's depiction of Jonathan (played by '70s icon Elliot Gould) nailed him.&nbsp; But as I re-read <em>The Life &amp; Times </em>today I realized that argument would be facile in the extreme.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Jonathan's obsessions can be catalogued with ease: pointless games imbued with meaning, the awkwardness of lives acrumbling, the divorces of the preternaturally witty and their relation to the kids' unconscious, and basketball.&nbsp; This particular constellation of interests appears both in the narratives of Jonathan's <em>The Life &amp; Times </em>and <em>B. </em>and Noah's <em>Kicking &amp; Screaming</em>.&nbsp; (And what, I ask, would Freud make of this family's obsession with ampersands?)&nbsp; In Noah's film, the viewer witnesses Gould attempt to connect with his estranged son through talk of the Knicks' failures and Patrick Ewing's failings.&nbsp; Grover, Noah's surrogate, belongs to a circle who fall out via an argument about the protocols of an improvised bar-room trivia game.&nbsp; Having read Jonathan's work, viewers of Noah's films cannot help but see a world limited by his father's obsessions—a Bloomian anxiety <em>in extremis</em>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Lest you think I desire diminishing the brilliance of my favorite film of the 1990s, I will add that I think this appropriation, intentional or not, an incredible glance into the relation of authors to their lives.&nbsp; That Noah crafts a fictional father who resembles his father's fictions more than his father fascinates me.&nbsp; Take Jonathan's short story &quot;Familiar Games.&quot;&nbsp; It contains a pointless contest irrationally imbued with significance, intimations of lives teetering on the flimsiest of fulcrums, portentions of divorce and, naturally, basketball.&nbsp; In the story, the narrator (who will grow to become a Jonathan-esque divorcee) tells of a contest between his mother and his younger brother Phil.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The story begins &quot;Every family has its games.&quot;&nbsp; The narrator notes that &quot;Phil practiced at every opportunity, studied self-improvement.&nbsp; One could wake up at two A.M., look out the window, and see him taking shots in the dark.&nbsp; His tenacity awed me.&quot;&nbsp; It did not awe his mother.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This will have to be quick,&quot; she said, making the first basket before Phil could ready himself on defense.&nbsp; &quot;There's something in the oven that needs basting.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Put aside for the moment that this mother trash talks like Gary Payton.&nbsp; (&quot;There's something in the oven that needs basting&quot; being better than the best cut I've ever heard on the court.)&nbsp; This narrative of a contest of a son versus the mother who will float Jordanesque to sink the final shot only to float (if you believe the book a cycle instead of a collection) out her marriage to his unimaginative and obsessive father—this contest hits all the same notes about mothers and fathers that Noah hits in <em>Kicking &amp; Screaming</em>.&nbsp; I daresay this is not a coincidence.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Because it isn't.&nbsp; Jonathan's novel <em>B</em> contains a chapter called &quot;The Reading&quot; in which a writer rides the rails to an obscure liberal arts college in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; No one meets him at the station.&nbsp; Eventually he finds his way to campus and into an auditorium awaiting a famous &quot;trial lawyer (and former basketball great) who has a predilection for representing the blatantly guilty.&quot;&nbsp; He tries to tell the crowd that they've mistaken him for some other dignitary, that's he's only a poet, that their shouts are unwarranted.&nbsp; But his plea that &quot;I am not the man you think I am&quot; only excites the audience more.&nbsp; He cannot win the game he has inadvertantly entered—only by reading his poetry can he lull them to sleep.&nbsp; He breaks the rules of the game the audience expected to play and suffers the penalty of leaving, <em>Pnin</em>-like, on a train whose destination he does not know.</p>

<p>This is the &quot;father&quot; Noah incorporates into <em>Kicking &amp; Screaming</em>.&nbsp; Not a real person but a fictional persona.&nbsp; In short, Noah ups the ante on Bloomian anxiety by incorporating his fictional father into his autobiographical films.&nbsp; Of course, I could be completely intellectualizing this.&nbsp; Jonathan's unreliable narrators may be more reliable than I suppose and Noah's descriptions of them more faithful to fact than fiction.&nbsp; But somehow I doubt that two people so intelligent could fall so forcefully for each other's schtick.</p>

Vampires?</strong> Today I learned that Octavia Butler's published a new novel. It is not the final installment in her Parable series, I add with anger born of deep disappointment. (Parable of the Talents ranks among her best works and I've been awaiting the next volume for what feels like decades now.) It's called Fledgling and it's about . . . vampires. The strength of my reluctance to read another novel about vampires so long as I live falls somewhere between Schwarzeneggerian and Samsonian.[1] Why the reluctance? Her name is Ann Rice. Her Halloween parties were notorious in N'awlins as I adolesced and I attended more than I could care to. Watching all the &quot;vampires&quot; stalk her beautiful home in a desperate attempt to impress her . . . or even worse, witnessing the same conversation circle the room after Interview with the Vampire hit the silver screen: &quot;Is that Brad Pitt? I don't know. I heard he's in costume.&quot; &quot;There's Tom Cruise! You can tell 'cause he's so short.&quot; So I don't like vampires or novels about vampires or films about vampires or tele . . . nevermind, I love the only television show I've ever watched about vampires. What separated Buffy the Vampire Slayer from all the nocturnal emissions of self-identifying goths? In 500 words or less: Joss Whedon. The show bore his fingerprints. When it didn't—when I had to dust the set for evidence of his presence—it stumbled. Over nothing. But somehow still managed to powderize every bone its body in the stumbling. Point being: I trust Mr. Whedon's ability to spin a yarn I want to hear. I trust Butler too. I didn't think I'd want to read books co-opted by every fad to strike academic pavement these past decades: feminism, post-colonialism, post-humanism, critical race theory, and I could continue. But her novels are smarter than academia's reductive readings let on. If ideas are bowling pins then Butler juggles them deftly, letting them light briefly on her fingertips before sending them into the air again . . . for academics to grab and run away with. That's the Butler I first encounter: a juggler with no pins to juggle. But as I read her works I realized that she's one of those not-rare-at-all authors who's much more intelligent than her critics suggest (or are); that the ideas they swipe from her air are handled improperly. I have so much faith in her at this point that I'm almost inclined to read Fledgling. I've got my finger on the &quot;Two Day 1-Click&quot; button and I'm not afraid to press it. So I am. But I shouldn't be. Implicit faith should be implicit faith? When you think about it, this issue isn't entirely divorced from what I was talking about the other day. Do you have faith in thems that speak or do you desire content above all else? [1] Random blip: Has anyone else who knows German had the misfortune of accidentally reading Arnold's name? I know what the...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/the_biannual_ac.html"><span><strong>The Bi-Annual Acephalous Pity Party; or, Earnest like Eddie Vedder only, er, Not So Handsome</strong> So you've exhausted your funding. After the Spring quarter of this year, despite the fact that you're a dedicated teacher who wants to teach, you will find yourself without a position in the institution you've dedicated the past 5 years of your life to. More to the point, you'll find yourself unable to continue refining the program you've invested the past two years of your life in. Not that the program's chair doesn't want you to. He'd love nothing more to employ you so that he doesn't have to fret over the new students and instructors every year. He feels more comfortable with you teaching and advising the new teachers . . . so comfortable, in fact, that he can focus without guilt on his upper division classes because he knows you have the lower division classes covered. But here's the thing: Normative time to finishing a dissertation is six years. If I'm still here in the Fall of 2006, that'll be my seventh year in the program. Normally, I'm not the type to complain. After all, I spent the Fall, Winter and Spring quarters of last year as a T.A. for 1) my advisor (Fall), 2) the chair of the Literary Journalism department (Winter) and 3) my own section Intro. to Literary Journalism (Spring) . . . all the while spending my &quot;days off&quot; at the hospital undergoing chemotherapy. See what I mean? I toughed it out. I didn't tell anyone a damn thing or take a leave of absence . . . and now I realize I should have. I should have told everyone every damn thing. I should have taken a leave of absence. Do you know how much work you can accomplish when on the days you don't teach you're dosed with an ever-changing array of chemicals which kill cancer cells but also convince your immune system to summer in Tahiti? None. Maybe not &quot;none,&quot; but certainly &quot;less than expected.&quot; In retrospect, as my advisor (who has been nothing short of gracious about the entire affair) informed me, I should've taken a leave of absence. I should've extended the time in which I work on my dissertation while teaching another year. Now I face the prospect of a year without teaching . . . a year in which I'll do nothing but research and live off the wife's slim salary. (Money's not an object. To call me &quot;frugal&quot; would be an understatement. I'm a Jew, er, &quot;Jew.&quot; We have savings.) What I fear isn't the lack of income but the lack of intellectual stimulation. I fear that if I'm not forced to bandy my ideas in something resembling a public sphere that they'll cement themselves in their current, untested forms. So here's the radical proposition I'm considering: I have a number of regular readers whose intelligence I respect immensely. A few of you have already stepped to the plate and offered to read my dissertation—and for that I am most grateful—but I want to open this...</span></a></div>
