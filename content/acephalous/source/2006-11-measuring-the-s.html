People write in general (typically truimphant) terms about how swiftly a single voice can travel from one side of the internet to the other and back again, but how often does that actually happen? Of those instances, how often is it organic? Most memes, I'd wager, are only superficially organic: beginning small, they acquire minor prominence among low-traffic blogs before being picked up by a high-traffic one, from which many more low-traffic blogs snatch them.

Imply I'm one of them. (Do whatever you have to. If that fails, try whatever it takes.) Ping Technorati. While you do that, a script I've written will track this meme (via Technorati) across the internet in 10 minute intervals. It will record the number of links to this post, register their authority and create a database the very size of which will cause my poor processor to fall tumbling, in flames, down a steep cliff. (So be it. We all must makes sacrifices in the name of science.) My fear is that I'll post this and no one will participate in my experiment. On the one hand, that'll be educational too, allowing me to talk about top-down vs. bottom-up dynamics, the ineffectiveness of compulsion and coercion on free-range bloggers, &amp;c.

		<span id="comment-25849735-content"><p>Think carefully about why a meme spreads: there are two major factors.  One is how good/fun the meme is and the other is how many readers read the original blog and how many readers they have in their own networks.  You are not controlling for either of these factors.  Furthermore, your meme is the blog equivalent of a chain letter, which is annoying as hell.  It differs from an actual blog meme in the very important respect that instead of spreading itself via its entertainment value, it spreads itself via an attempt at ethical coercion: &quot;Beg them.  Relate sob stories about poor graduate students in desperate circumstances.&quot;  You&#39;re down on the level of a &quot;Microsoft will donate one cent to kids with cancer for every copy of this e-mail it receives&quot; hoax, except hopefully yours won&#39;t be successful.  Sorry for the flame (not usually prone to those) but I feel strongly that people in the scholarly world should set a good example of clear thinking!!  If we can&#39;t think, how can we expect our politicians to?  This &quot;experiment&quot; is marvel of fuzzy thinking.  :P</p></span>

<p>Z, it seems to me that what really separates this from a chain letter is the passive nature of it.  For all the begging SEK, you, or I might do, it&#39;s still within our own little worlds.  And not by emailing 100 of our closest friends.</p>

<p>I have no idea where the data will lead on this one -- I would have thought it might be useful to know where a linker first saw notice of this, but then the machine might be tallying that automatically.  I also note that I didn&#39;t follow the instructions exactly -- I&#39;m not going to check, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if non-compliance of that, or other flavors, is common.  Does it screw up the experiment?  Well, I don&#39;t know, and don&#39;t care enough to go back and re-write my linking post.</p></span>

So instead of starting with low-traffic posts, and waiting for the idea to be &quot;caught,&quot; you&#39;re starting right at the top.</p>

<p>You should have asked Dr. Bitch to wait a while before posting her link.</p>

<p>Maybe identify two or three ideas that got serious play on big blogs but started on smaller blogs (I have no immediate idea what those would be) and then use Technorati to get incomplete but useful data on the speed of transmission in the past?  I bet you&#39;re already doing that....</p></span>

		<span id="comment-25863560-content"><p>Yeah, I wonder how accurately this can be measured. Memes are funny things. People link to them because they are entertained by them, but then, after a time, although everyone&#39;s still looking at the thing, no one links to it anymore because it&#39;s &quot;been done.&quot; I don&#39;t link to memes because everyone who reads my blog reads higher-traffic people who stay on top of stuff better than I do. Would all of us who are linking to Scott have done so if he had provided some memey content, blisteringly entertaining or not? I would assume most of my readers already read Acephalous, so I wouldn&#39;t. I&#39;ll be interested to hear your analysis at MLA, Scott.</p></span>

Very, Very Fast</strong> It should've been just another sentence, one more soldier marching through my twenty-minute presentation on &quot;The New Interdisciplinary.&quot; Now it's a bad apple threatening to spoil the entire ... soldier barrel. Metaphors aside, my interests have expanded to accommodate what I created (albeit accidentally) to prove my original point. To wit: Reading through the academic literature on blogging, I detected notes of vintage 1999 Wired. Scholars wrote as if the bubble had never burst, as if the wildest posthuman dreams were being fulfilled in an interpenetrative blogospheric mêlée. Such language reminded me less of scholarship than the transformation of quantum physics into insipid neospiritual pablum à la What the #$*! Do We Know?!. So I decided to include a sentence—a single, solitary sentence—debunking the idea that one lone voice can be heard in the wilderness, that in truth the blogosphere is highly hierarchical, and that the likelihood of that voice being heard depends on cultivating the wilderness in which bloggers scream. Not that lungs don't matter: the more powerful and engaging the writer, the more likely he or she will be to find and retain an audience. Finding that audience, as any blogger knows, is a difficult task. But given effective quality control, an audience could be enticed to follow strains of thought personally and disciplinarily foreign, i.e. outside idiosyncratic and professional interests. [1] As my 500 devout readers know, I'm a dogged (if amateur) empiricist. I cannot simply make a claim: I must do everything I in my power to verify it. I can't put sentence-to-processor without doing my best to establish its validity. Instead of slapping that sentence down the auto-save abyss, I decided to post something. Little did I know, that sentence would blossom into a meme—which, as Scott McLemee reminds us, &quot;appeals to bloggers because it has 'me' in it, twice.&quot; Not just any meme, mind you, but one I barely have the time, energy, or proper equipment and training to track. It may have even crashed my campus network. It could be a coincidence (it is) that it went down for half an hour (three, actually) while I ran my experiment, but I like to think (on occasion, but always poorly) that the awesome computing power (a Leading Edge Model D86, duct tape, ABC Laffy Taffy) behind my little science fair project (1st Place: Jimmy's Amazing! Volcano) brought the (bring it on!), brought the (oh, it's been brought)—Can you excuse me a minute? [2] Where was I? Right, that sentence blossomed into a meme I'm almost unqualified to track. People may think, &quot;Why then did you propose it? Just to get a little attention?&quot; No. I thought it'd scuttle the margins of the academic blogosphere, crawl whimpering under the couch and expire. Why? Because of its lame content: If you're interested in academic blogging and presentations at the MLA, check this box. Enthralling, ain't it? Turns out it is. Now, if I only knew what to make of it ... [1] Speaking of the latter...</span></a></div>
