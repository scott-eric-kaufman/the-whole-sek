        <meta name="description" content="Yet again, the duty falls to me. Here goes: Nolte is complaining about Steven Zeitchik’s article in the L.A. Times, in which he writes: But the Stallone picture—with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (”We will kill this American disease,” as the TV spot enticed us)—planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. According to Nolte, this amounts to Zeitchik “toxifying ‘The Expendables’ by ridiculing its simple worldview,” but Nolte fails to explain why a film should be praised for the simplicity of its worldview. The most he can muster is that “the nihilism found in the moral equivalency preached by the likes of George Clooney and Paul Haggis is [not] complicated,” which amounts to “if they can do it, we can do it.” The problem with that logic should be obvious: it’s not a defense of simplistic worldviews, it’s the claim that if I set your house on fire, you would be right to retaliate by doing the same to mine. That both positions may be weak is evidently a point beyond his ability to comprehend. Nolte then provides another non-answer, claiming that a simple straight-forward story that’s actually about something is much more difficult to successfully craft than a confusing and muddled story that’s believes in absolutely nothing. Paint-by-numbers might not be Rembrandt but it takes more skill than throwing monkey shit at a canvas. Note that he again argues that The Expendables is “about” something without ever defining what that thing is. This is the obverse of Groucho Marx’s “Whatever It Is, I’m Against It” argument, in that whatever The Expendables is about, Nolte’s in favor of it, whatever it might be. But whatever it is, it’s morally unambiguous, which means the following claim of Zeitchik is utter bunk: [u]ntil this weekend, old-school action movies—defined, for argument’s sake, as films with a slew of explosions, a shortage of moral ambiguity and a triumph of physical effects over digital ones—had seen better days. Nolte responds: [T]his is what happens when you’re in possession of a laughably biased theory in search of proof—especially when the surprise successes of “300″ and “Taken,” not to mention “Salt,” the first “Transformers,” and “Gran Torino”—make a total fool of that moral ambiguity theory. Admittedly, Nolte is an expert in all things tendentious, so he should know it when he sees it. But a brief comparison of the material between both parties’ em-dashes demonstrates who’s arguing honestly and who isn’t. Zeitchik defines “old-school action movies … as films with a slew of explosions, a shortage of moral ambiguity and a triumph of physical effects over digital ones.” Nolte responds by listing four films, but only one of them, Taken, fits Zeitchik’s definition. 300 was filmed entirely in front of a green screen; Gran Torino contains no “explosions,” much less “a slew of” them; and unless he knows something I don’t, the Transformers in Transformers..." />

			<p>Yet <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/08/tendentious-people-are-tendentious-and-frequently-dumb">again</a>, the duty falls to me.  Here goes: Nolte is complaining about Steven Zeitchik’s <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/08/the-expendables-sylvester-stallone-action-movies-guns.html?utm_source=latimes.com&amp;utm_medium=twitter">article</a> in the <em>L.A. Times</em>, in which he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the Stallone picture—with its hard-charging,  take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real  world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its  caricature of freedom-hating enemies (”We will kill this American  disease,” as the TV spot enticed us)—planted itself squarely in the  old-school genre.</p>

<p>According to Nolte, this amounts to Zeitchik “toxifying ‘The  Expendables’ by ridiculing its simple worldview,” but Nolte fails to  explain why a film should be <em>praised</em> for the simplicity of its  worldview.  The most he can muster is that “the nihilism found in the  moral equivalency preached by the likes of George Clooney and Paul  Haggis is [not] complicated,” which amounts to “if they can do it, we  can do it.”  The problem with that logic should be obvious: it’s not a  defense of simplistic worldviews, it’s the claim that if I set your  house on fire, you would be right to retaliate by doing the same to  mine.  That <em>both</em> positions may be weak is evidently a point beyond his ability to comprehend.</p>
<p>Nolte then provides another non-answer, claiming that a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>simple straight-forward story that’s actually about  something is much more difficult to successfully craft than a confusing  and muddled story that’s believes in absolutely nothing.  Paint-by-numbers might not be Rembrandt but it takes more skill than  throwing monkey shit at a canvas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that he <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/08/tendentious-people-are-tendentious-and-frequently-dumb">again</a> argues that <em>The Expendables</em> is “about” something without ever defining what that thing is.  This is  the obverse of Groucho Marx’s “Whatever It Is, I’m Against It”  argument, in that whatever <em>The Expendables</em> is about, Nolte’s in  favor of it, whatever it might be.  But whatever it is, it’s morally  unambiguous, which means the following claim of Zeitchik is utter bunk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[u]ntil this weekend, old-school action movies—defined,  for argument’s sake, as films with a slew of explosions, a shortage of  moral ambiguity and a triumph of physical effects over digital ones—had  seen better days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nolte responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]his is what happens when you’re in possession of a  laughably biased theory in search of proof—especially when the surprise  successes of  “300″ and “Taken,” not to mention “Salt,” the first  “Transformers,” and “Gran Torino”—make a total fool of that moral  ambiguity theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Admittedly, Nolte is an expert in all things tendentious, so he  should know it when he sees it.  But a brief comparison of the material  between both parties’ em-dashes demonstrates who’s arguing honestly and  who isn’t.  Zeitchik defines “old-school action movies … as films with a  slew of explosions, a shortage of moral ambiguity and a triumph of  physical effects over digital ones.”  Nolte responds by listing four  films, but only one of them, <em>Taken</em>, fits Zeitchik’s definition.  <em>300</em> was filmed entirely in front of a green screen; <em>Gran Torino</em> contains no “explosions,” much less “a slew of” them; and unless he knows something I don’t, the Transformers in <em>Transformers</em> aren’t “physical effects.”</p>
<p>In short, Nolte isn’t refuting Zeitchik so much as talking right past  him.  Why?  Because, to quote the man himself, “this is what happens  when you’re in possession of a laughably biased theory in search of  proof.”</p>

He writes, &quot;especially when the surprise successes of &#39;300&#39; and &#39;Taken,&#39; not to mention &#39;Salt,&#39; the first &#39;Transformers,&#39; and &#39;Gran Torino&#39;—make a total fool of that moral ambiguity theory.&quot;</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, he&#39;s not saying these films fit all of the LA Times guy&#39;s criteria; he&#39;s just saying that these films all avoid moral ambiguity and have been quite successful, suggesting that such films haven&#39;t fallen on hard times.</p></span>

As for Nolte, he&#39;s setting up a false equivalence: Zeitchik isn&#39;t talking about moral ambiguity in isolation, but as a component in what he refers to as &quot;old-school action movies.&quot;  Nolte attacks him on the basis of there having been, recently, morally unambiguous films, despite that not having been Zeitchik&#39;s point.  This is a classic example of finding, and only finding, those elements of an argument you were looking for ... it&#39;s just most people are so dumb as to include a list of features that proves that that&#39;s exactly what we were up to.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0133f31ce9a2970b-content"><p>But the problem is that Zeitchik is equally slimy here in the way he defines &quot;old school action movie&quot; in the first place.  I mean, it&#39;s like saying &quot;the old school novel was only in book format, but the new school novel is in book and electronic format,&quot; and using that distinction for an argument about the decline of the old school novel.</p>

<p>But an action movie needn&#39;t have a slew of explosions.  *Jaws* is definitely an old school action movie, even with its lack of much action for a good deal of the film, as is *Shaft* or *Superfly*, neither of which involves explosions.  And an action movie cannot be defined around how its special effects are achieved (which would be like defining literary genres around the type of ink or printing press used).  </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t see why Nolte, who is mainly interested in the issue of moral ambiguity in his piece, needs to address Zeitchik&#39;s rather silly genre definition.  Nolte&#39;s point is that the true form of action movie is not in decline and that a manichean worldview is not a point against an action film.</p>

<p>It seems to me like both Zeitchik and Nolte are rather limited thinkers.  What&#39;s your horse in this race?  Is it simply that Big Hollywood is where writing about cinema goes to die?  Or are you interested in something about Stallone&#39;s film?</p></span>

<p><em>Jaws</em> is no more an action film than <em>The Birds</em>, and I&#39;d list them both under suspense.  <em>Shaft</em> is a blaxploitation film that takes its narrative cues from Chandler and Hammett and its visual ones from police procedures.  The &quot;action film&quot; as an aesthetic object is a product of the &#39;80s, and can be described in further detail than Zeitchik did and, to put it to the ultimate criterion of a category, generate a substantial list of aesthetic objects from the same period that share the details described.  They need not even be successful: Dolph Lundgren is a failed action movie star if there ever was one, but his films, despite being failures, are action films nonetheless. </p>

<p><em>What&#39;s your horse in this race?</em></p>

<p>Railing against the flattening of culture into ideology?  Or maybe the other way around, and I&#39;m railing against the elevation of certain cultural artifacts on the basis of ideology.  It&#39;s one thing, for example, for you and I to disagree about the merits of Edgar Wright, another entirely if one of us were to dismiss it on account of its normalization of homosexuality.  That&#39;s not the game afoot here, though, with Breitbart and his minions: they&#39;re old school culture warriors and their voices are gaining traction.  I see it everyday on Facebook, and a lot of the conservative nonsense I write about begins as a reply to a link posted by someone I know, or think I know, is a decent person, but they happen to live in an environs (the South) that&#39;s militating against their dignity.</p></span>

If you asked Palin or any of the others who have temporarily abandoned their disdain for all things East Coast and elitist whether it would be acceptable if someone built a mosque within a 1.5 mile radius of where the Twin Towers once stood, they would likely continue protesting because they are utterly ignorant of the fact that that roughly eliminates everything south of NYU.* To their minds, New York City is less of a teeming than an endless metropolis, one that begins on the southern tip of the island and extends beyond the horizons to the north and east and west. They fail to recognize that there was a reason New Yorkers stopped building out and started building up—there is only so much room on an island 22 square miles in area—and so they assume that renovating a Men’s Wearhouse into a community center must, perforce, be an insult to the memories of the victims of 9/11. Their reaction to learning that the mosque being built on Ground Zero is actually a community center being built two blocks away is a stubborn spectacle couched in deliberately deceptive language. Palin’s rhetorical transformation of “the mosque being built on Ground Zero” into “this Ground Zero mosque” would be brilliant if intentional. It draws a scar across an infinite island and declares everything to its south to be sacred American soil. The area she calls “Ground Zero” is a fictional place in whose name she and her ideological brethren can express their xenophobia without fear of being called xenophobic. She and they can claim to support the good Muslims—the ones who know that their place, literally, is not in lower Manhattan—safe in the knowledge that, with a wink, their fear of people with strange names from foreign lands can arguably be something other than it is. In her mind and theirs, “this Ground Zero mosque” is less of a building than a psychological representation of the controversy caused by their ignorance of the island’s geography, i.e. they have retooled their own stupidity into a potent rhetorical feint whose truth is undeniable because it refers to the debate about an imaginary building on an infinitely large island. For Palin and those like her, the “Ground Zero” in “this Ground Zero mosque” functions not as a reference to the former site of the Twin Towers, but as a simple adjective that identifies the particular “mosque” in question. That it happens not to be located on Ground Zero is, at this point in the conversation, irrelevant. Palin proves this by obfuscation. Her concern about “this Ground Zero mosque” is...</span></a></div>

Such are the burdens of high expectations. The final scenes of the most recent episode, &quot;The Rejected,&quot; demonstrate that the series deserves those expectations by living up to them. &quot;The Rejected&quot; is the first episode this season not to focus entirely on the perils of being single and Don Draper, instead concentrating on Peter Campbell's continued development into the person his wife thought she married and Peggy Olson's somewhat reluctant embrace of Beat ethics. The closing scene—or scenes if you want to be technical—simultaneously links the two of them while showing the growing distance between. It begins inside the offices of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce with Campbell doing a man thing with other men: This is the world Peggy can never enter. It is medium long shot because business isn't personal, even when conducted with your father-in-law (who is square in the center of the frame). Director John Slattery then cuts to a long shot of the Beatnik crowd Peggy now runs with: They continue to approach until they walk into medium long shot, at which point they are stopped short by the glass doors of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. What follows is unsubtle but effective: as these people belong neither to the world of the firm nor the one it appeals to, they are denied entry. Slattery shoots them through the material barrier separating them from that world, then cuts to a long shot of its smiling Cerberus: Peggy quickly steps into the frame and—just in case you missed that worlds were on the verge of colliding here—Slattery cuts to a long shot behind the secretary in order to survey the scene: Peggy is on the left, aligned with the Beatniks; Peter's on the right, doing man things with men; and they are separated by the guardian of one of the only professions that could keep a creative woman and an enterprising young businessman in the same orbit. The secretary represents what binds these two together while simultaneously keeping the worlds the inhabit apart. It is no accident that her stiff posture cuts a line through the frame that is continued by the joint of the glass wall and wood paneling. Without pushing the windows-equal-freedom angle too strongly, there is no denying that in this scene the set works as representations of the respective worlds Peggy and Pete inhabit: a glass wall leading outside and wood paneling of the sort found in august boardrooms and Mason lodges. As Peggy heads to the door, Slattery cuts to a medium shot that reiterates the fact that Peter runs in the exclusively male circles she never can: Then he cuts to another long shot in which all the parties are visible: Peggy is leaving Peter and his world behind, literally in the background, and is being escorted by a lesbian into one he is barred from. Significantly, if your eyes follow Peggy out...</span></a></div>
