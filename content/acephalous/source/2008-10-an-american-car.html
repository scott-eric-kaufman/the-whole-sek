        <meta name="description" content="(x-posted.) This weekend witnessed the nationwide release of An American Carol, the new comedy by noted comedic genius, David Zucker.* The folks at The National Review could hardly contain themselves. Kathleen Parker wrote “it’s funny—if you like that sort of thing.” Someone who wrote to Kathryn Jean Lopez “wasn’t disappointed.” Given how fond conservatives are of extrapolating what Real Americans feel from the box office receipts of recent anti-war films, I wonder what they’ll make of An American Carol’s success. Here are the films Real Americans voted down with their wallets: In the Valley of Elah (2007) – $6.8 million. Redacted (2007) – $.06 million. The Kingdom (2007) – $47.4 million. Rendition (2007) – $9.7 million. Lions for Lambs (2007) – $15 million. Home of the Brave (2006) – $.04 million. Bombs, all of them—unlike An American Carol, which raked in an impressive $3.4 million this weekend. That’s way more than the $4.5 million the film Stop-Loss scored in its opening weekend, a dismal return which had conservatives saying: People don’t go to theaters to sit through two hours of diatribes and propaganda on their leisure time. They’re not going to spend money on it. Now we have the proof. People are giving Hollywood pretty clear message on these message films: Do not want. We told them so. You tell ‘em! People don’t go to theaters to sit through two hours of diatribes and propaganda! Except for this fellow, who thought: That was the best scene in the film and it was way too short. They missed a huge opportunity to educate there. What scene would that be? Only the funniest in the entire film: Jon Voight at St. Paul’s Chapel in New York City, in the shadow of where the World Trade Center once stood, as George Washington, in a most moving scene, that will have you begging Voight to do a miniseries playing our nation’s first president. That’s Kathryn Jean Lopez again, and she knows from funny. This film was so funny, Lopez is persuaded that names like David Zucker, Steve McEveety, Myrna Sokoloff, Jon Voight, Kelsey Grammar, Robert Davi, and An American Carol star Kevin Farley will one day be recognized as revolutionaries. Or would have been, were it not for the liberal conspiracy: I’d love to see American Carol if THE DAMN THEATERS WHERE I LIVE WOULD PLAY THEM. There is suppression going on . . . The theatre squashed it in the tiniest room and didn’t have many times for it. Conspiracy! The blatant attempt to crush the spirit of the GOP is palpable.

<p>This weekend witnessed the nationwide release of <a href="http://thegspot.typepad.com/blog/2008/10/and-the-reviews.html"><em>An American Carol</em></a>, the new comedy by noted comedic genius, David Zucker.*&nbsp; The folks at <em>The National Review </em>could hardly contain themselves.&nbsp; Kathleen Parker <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YzhlZGMyYjJjZjcwNGQ1MjY3ZGQ2ZjEyMGNmNTFlN2Y=">wrote</a> “it’s funny—if you like that sort of thing.”&nbsp; Someone who <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MmI3MmEyN2ZlNDkyMDg5NGU3YjNkYzE1MGE5ZjU5ZGM=">wrote</a> to Kathryn Jean Lopez “wasn’t disappointed.”</p>
<p>Given how fond conservatives are of extrapolating what Real
Americans feel from the box office receipts of recent anti-war films, I
wonder what they’ll make of <em>An American Carol</em>’s success.&nbsp; Here are the films Real Americans voted down with their wallets:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478134/"><span style="font-style: italic;">In the Valley of Elah</span></a> (2007) – $6.8 million.<br />
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0937237/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Redacted</span></a> (2007) – $.06 million.<br />
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431197/"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Kingdom</span></a> (2007) – $47.4 million.<br />
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804522/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Rendition</span></a> (2007) – $9.7 million.<br />
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0891527/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Lions for Lambs</span></a> (2007) – $15 million.<br />
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0763840/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Home of the Brave</span></a> (2006) – $.04 million.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bombs, all of them—unlike <em>An American Carol</em>, which raked in an impressive <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/daily/chart/">$3.4 million</a> this weekend.&nbsp; That’s way more than the $4.5 million the film <em>Stop-Loss</em> scored in its opening weekend, a dismal return which had <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2007/11/09/hollywood-produces-anti-war-bombs/">conservatives</a> <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/03/29/new-anti-war-movie-tanks-because-americas-not-ready-yet-or-whatever/">saying</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>People don’t go to theaters to sit through two hours of
diatribes and propaganda on their leisure time. They’re not going to
spend money on it. <a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/071109/entertainment/entertainment_us_film_iraq_afghanistan">Now we have the proof.</a></p>
<p>People are giving Hollywood pretty clear message on these message films: Do not want. <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2007/09/15/wsj-anti-war-films-probably-gonna-tank-at-the-box-office-this-fall/">We told them so.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>You tell ‘em!&nbsp; People don’t go to theaters to sit through two hours of diatribes and propaganda!&nbsp; Except for <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/04/video-an-american-carol-debuts-in-new-york/comment-page-1/#comment-1493211">this fellow</a>, who thought:</p>
<blockquote><p>That was the best scene in the film and it was way too short.&nbsp; They missed a huge opportunity to educate there.</p></blockquote>
<p>What scene would that be?&nbsp; Only the <em>funniest </em>in the entire film:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jon Voight at St. Paul’s Chapel in New York City, in the
shadow of where the World Trade Center once stood, as George
Washington, in a most moving scene, that will have you begging Voight
to do a miniseries playing our nation’s first president.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MTIyNWNlNmE3MzAzNGI4ZmYxZTI1ZWE1NjIyMmYwYzg=">Kathryn Jean Lopez</a> again, and she knows from funny.&nbsp; This film was so funny, Lopez is</p>
<blockquote><p>persuaded that names like David Zucker, Steve McEveety, Myrna Sokoloff, Jon Voight, Kelsey Grammar, Robert Davi, and <em>An American Carol</em> star Kevin Farley will one day be recognized as revolutionaries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or would have been, were it not for <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/04/video-an-american-carol-debuts-in-new-york/comment-page-1/#comment-1493105">the liberal conspiracy</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’d love to see <em>American Carol</em> if THE DAMN THEATERS WHERE I LIVE WOULD PLAY THEM.</p>
<p>There is suppression going on . . . The theatre squashed it in the tiniest room and didn’t have many times for it.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>[A] moviegoer who read in the paper that AAC was playing
at a Burbank theater. Upon arriving at the theater, there was no movie
poster and no title on the marquee. They had to ask if it was playing.
They were told it was. There was a sound problem and everyone asked for
their money back. Sounds fishy to me. I wouldn’t be surprised if a bit
of sabotage is going on.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>There’s no irony—and no mystery—in immigrants being
very patriotic (and more patriotic and more openly grateful to their
country than ‘native-born Americans’).&nbsp; You appreciate that which you
never felt entitled to.</p>
<p>Read some of what Jack London wrote: his English (which he taught
himself) was better than most Americans, and he made the most of his
opportunity to live and write here.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t know where to—I mean, that last comment is a trenchant
indication of the cultural literacy of the people out to defend our
culture from radical socialist revolutionaries like <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Jack London</span> Barack Obama.</p>

Obama’s “palling around with terrorists,” yes he is: Because a real American would’ve planted his platform right smack in front of the Liberty Bell, yes he would. This isn’t to say I’m still waiting for the folks who attack Obama for his connection to Ayers to acknowledge that the man who financed the Annenberg Challenge—a.k.a. Annenberg—was a close, personal friend of Ronald Reagan. Because they won’t, you know. Wouldn’t suit “the narrative.” The fact that it’s Annenberg who gave Ayers the $50M these folks claim is proof of Obama’s ideological kinship with the Weather Underground is irrelevant, because, well, because. Reagan was a patriot. Played “Born in the U.S.A.” at every—I mean, it’s not like that guitar-totin’ fellow in the picture knows jack about Philadelphia— —Obama is a terrorist, alright?
