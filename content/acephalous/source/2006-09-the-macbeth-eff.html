<p>&quot;Could be.&nbsp; Should we do a study?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds great!&nbsp; But how would we study that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;First, we'll determine whether a threat to moral purity increases the mental accessibility of cleansing-related words.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah!&nbsp; We'll ask participants to recall in detail either an ethical or unethical deed from their past and describe any feelings or emotions they experienced!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then we'll have them engage in a word completion task in which they convert word fragments into meaningful words!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And of the six word fragments, three could be completed as cleansing-related words or as unrelated words!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like W_ _ H, SH_ _ ER, and S_ _P!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then we'll see whether those who recalled an unethical deed generated more cleansing-related words than those who recalled an ethical deed, suggesting that unethical behavior enhances the accessbility of cleasning-related concepts!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Or maybe they thought the Shakespeare brand would help them find an audience.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Seriously though, I have more of a problem with the unexamined theory of the symbolic favored by contemporary psychology than its psychoanalytic equivalent.&nbsp; Not that depth or complexity necessarily mean anything, but the ease with which Zhong and Liljenquist place cleanliness next to turpitude disturbs me:</p><blockquote><p>Physical cleansing may wash away moral sins through symbolic self-completion; that is, people are motivated to complete their self-definitions (e.g., musicians) when indicators or symbols of this definition are lacking (e.g., skills) by engaging in activities that complete the symbols (e.g., training). Thus, when moral self-definition is at stake, such as when one has indulged in morally questionable activities, one should naturally be motivated to engage in activities that will restore moral integrity.</p></blockquote><p>It <em>must </em>be more complex than that.&nbsp; Why seek symbolic self-completion for an actual offense?&nbsp; But why address those assumptions when you can prescribe a possible remedy for all human ills:</p><blockquote><p>Future studies that specifically address the psychological and behavioral consequences of physical cleanliness will provide valuable insight into regulatory mechanisms that drive ethical decisions. Given the boost to one's moral self afforded by physical cleansing, how might it influence subsequent behavior? Would adherence to a rigorous hygiene regimen facilitate ethical behavior? Or, would cleansing ironically license unethical behavior? It remains to be seen whether clean hands really do make a pure heart, but our studies indicate that they at least provide a clean conscience after moral trespasses.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to describe what the mind does, another to describe why it does it.  I don&#39;t find the psychoanalytic explanation for why people employ symbolic substitution any more convincing than the bold declarations in the article.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-22545712-content"><p>There&#39;s an interesting division, in these comments, between people who appreciate the confirmation of folk  psychology, like Tim, and people who appreciate your (Scott&#39;s) implied critique.</p>

<p>As far as &quot;getting clean&quot; goes, I think both parties could be easily satisfied. Available evidence confirms Shakespeare and folk wisdom because our culture has made a resonant, but nonetheless arbitrary, symbolism that most people accept. The symbol itself is culture, not just the recognition of it. It reminds me of Scott&#39;s comment in some earlier post on psychoanalysis, that one could <i>give oneself</i> a Freudian unconscious with enough time and effort. The structures of thought are that plastic.</p>

<p>I would love to hear alternatives to the psychoanalytic explanation of symbolism (basically, that symbolism is a symptom of repression). One reason why rituals (of any sort, not just baptisms / cleansings) are appealing has, in my view, to do with our experience of time. Time is undifferentiated, a fact that makes it difficult for us to recognize the moment when our misdeed ceases to apply. The ritual creates a break, one which is entirely justified as a mirror help up to one&#39;s freedom: this is the voluntary alienation of consciousness into the material as described in Hegel, as well as the continual estrangement from &quot;self&quot; in Sartre and even Beckett.</p>

<p>In historical terms, however, this break is absurd, no matter how much of a role it might play in Christian mythology. Hence Nietzsche&#39;s theory of totality and eternal recurrence, and the revenant-like afterlife of the deed in Macbeth.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-22553728-content"><p>It should perhaps be noted that much of what you’re complaining about can be easily dismissed as a peculiarity of a particular academic subculture.  If you read the passages (as well as the rest of the article, I would guess) carefully, you’ll notice that few, if any, actual assertions are made.  Every sentence contains a “may” or a “should” or a “remains to be seen”.  This is a convention of scientific writing in which we make all kinds of over-the-top predictions and speculations while making it perfectly clear that we are <i>not</i> indulging in any kind of over-the-top predictions or speculations.  Most journals have this stuff under the subheading “Discussion”, which basically just means “here comes the rampant speculation and self-promotions!”.  The <i>Science/Nature</i> publishing format has done away with the usual introduction/methods/results/discussion subheadings, which means you have to pick it apart yourself.</p>

<p><i>I always find it interesting when little nuggets of folk psychology are confirmed.</i></p>

<p>Thus, confirmed is a very strong word...</p></span>

		<span id="comment-22659382-content"><p>I am often amused by the reactions of some when a piece of brain science research makes the news, especially if the authors of the article make guarded claims about what the research might say about human behavior.  Some folks accuse the authors of brain research of being most unholy: thou shall not link brain research to how people behave in the ordinary humdrum world.</p>

<p>Let us back up for a moment.  The major impetus for conducting brain research is medicine.  When people suffer disease or trauma to the brain it is useful to have physicians who actually know as much as possible about how the brain works.</p>

<p>Those suffering from brain maladies do not rush off to visit an epistemologist or a literary critic expert in the psychology contained in the Eighteenth Century novel.  This seems to be an obvious example of people voting with their feet rather than their pens or mouths.</p>

<p>Besides being amused, I am also mystified as to the sacred ox gored by brain research.  You might think the notion that we can consciously introspect on the mind and arrive at scientific results had died a natural death.  Could its demise be premature because of the large industry the notion supports?</p>

<p>I would coin a name for the effect and phenomenon, but I do not want to step onto dangerous ground.</p></span>

<p>The only absolute fact is that there is no such thing as absolute fact, and, in the case of scientific research, this is absolutely true! </p>

<blockquote><em>
Every sentence contains a &quot;may&quot; or a &quot;should&quot;  
</em></blockquote>

<p>The &quot;may&quot; is always refracted to become &quot;does&quot; as it passes through the lens of the media. </p>

<p>Brain imaging studies are very trendy at the moment, and are usually reported in the mass media as showing that this occurs here or that occurs there. This  will eventually lead us back to a new phrenology. Brain function is far more complex than that; all behaviours involve parallel processing by multiple modules.</p>

<blockquote><em>
You might think the notion that we can consciously introspect on the mind and arrive at scientific results had died a natural death.
</em></blockquote>

<p>The elucidation of the biological basis of mind and behaviour will be the goal of neuroscience in this century, and beyond.</p>

<blockquote><em>
 
you should visit [the neurophilosopher&#39;s blog] if only so you can say &quot;I read him before he became a Scienceblogger
</em></blockquote>

<p>Me? On ScienceBlogs? Never! Well, actually, I&#39;ve considered it, but have decided to remain independent.</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, have you (Scott) noticed that the layout of our blogs is identical? I think you should click back and forth to obtain some empirical evidence of this fact, and encourage all your readers to do the same!</p>

<p>No doubt - in fact we&#39;re lucky if it doesn&#39;t become an &quot;absolutely does&quot; in the media.  That said, I actually think it becomes &quot;does&quot; in our own minds all too often.  I hate writing like that.</p></span>

As I noted last month, I've come to Shakespeare through the criticism. Instead of having my love of The Bard desanguinated by years of graduate study, I've acquired a taste for the man whose works inspired Dead Poets Society to inspire generations to hazard a thwack at the GRE Subject Exam in Literature in English.[1] Not only that, I've been inspired by the very works which earn Rosenbaum's ire: Had Rosenbaum finished up at Yale and landed an academic job (at a time when it was still possible to find one), he would probably have been one of those colleagues soured by the success of New Historicism, cultural materialism, and deconstruction. By the 1980s, Jonathan Dollimore's Radical Tragedy: Religion, Ideology, and Power in the Drama of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries had replaced Cleanth Brooks's reading of Macbeth on syllabi, feminists had shown how much earlier Shakespeare scholarship had ignored, and Irving Ribner's providential approach to the history plays had given way to Stephen Greenblatt's &quot;Invisible Bullets: Renaissance Authority and Its Subversion, Henry IV and Henry V&quot; and other brilliant readings. Initially, I thought &quot;other brilliant readings&quot; Shapiro's attempt to distance his position on the Dollimore/Greenblatt junta from Rosenbaum's. Two paragraphs later, I had to reconsider: Rosenbaum blames &quot;Theory&quot; for this turn of events, and his book is in part an attempt to persuade us that, in the end, Theory lost and Shakespeareans are beginning to cast off its shackles and once again celebrate beauty, pleasure, and ambiguity. This is wishful thinking. Theory didn't lose; its victory was so complete that we no longer need Theory with a big T anymore because we all do theory, though most of us do it without giving it much thought. I don't exactly disagree with Shapiro so much as question how complete that victory actually is; that is to say, I wonder whether the distinction drawn here between the New Critics and proponents of theory ever existed outside overheated rhetoric. But I digress. I want to focus on that &quot;though most of us do it without giving it much thought,&quot; which strikes a similar note to the earlier &quot;other brilliant readings.&quot; Are Dollimore and Greenblatt like &quot;most of us&quot; or do they actually produce &quot;brilliant readings&quot;? Do they do so because of or despite their theoretical sophistication?[2] That Shapiro continues by praising Rosenbaum's account of Shakespeare's recent editorial history doesn't help much; after all, sussing out the authentic Shakespeare is more paleographical than bleeding edge. He wants to find the middleground between materialism (cultural and paleographical) and close-reading, like the work destined to follow Linne Mooney's &quot;Chaucer's Scribe&quot;—discussed informally here, formally here—in which historicism wins a &quot;victory&quot; as complete as theory's. Still, he insists there's a place for idiosyncratic works like Gross' Shylock Is Shakespeare: Argument and speculation can only get you so far in pursuit of a character's mystery. So he...</span></a></div>

Those who can't do, teach. Those who can't teach, well, they agree to guest post on conservative blogs. (About liberals in academia, no less.) Why? Because writing for a hostile audience—or, more accurately, writing for an audience you assume will be hostile—closely resembles walking into a classroom and informing students they'll be re-reading Huck Finn. Speaking of which, that's one of the topics I'll be addressing while there. Re-reading Huck Finn, that is. Why? Some fool devotes a chapter to it in his new book ... [Since PW's servers can't parse liberal guests posts, I've included the text of mine below the fold.] Pot, Kettle, Black and All That [Scott a.k.a. “The Token Lefty&quot;] For some reason, Jeff thought having me blog here wouldn’t be a terrible idea. I hope to make him rue that decision. Not rue rue, mind you, just a little. I’ll be concentrating my posts on two books which deal with multiculturalism in contemporary academia and American society. Each is brilliant in its own way, and each deserves a fair hearing. The first is Michael Bérubé‘s What’s Liberal about the Liberal Arts?; the second, Walter Benn Michaels’ The Trouble with Diversity. Who am I? My name’s Scott. Want to know more about me? Read my greatest hits. That said, I composed something which has absolutely nothing to do with either book this afternoon. You see, I thought it’d be nice to introduce myself via a rational examination of a clearly irrational argument. Looks like I was wrong: So you’ve all seen the infamous photo, right? If not, click on it. Finished? What did you see? I saw an awkward group portrait. Not nearly so graceful as, say, this one. Or this one. Or this one, either. It’s almost as if the photo Ann Althouse considers evidence of feminism’s death wasn’t a carefully orchestrated moment captured by a professional photographer to commemorate the happiest moment in a young couple’s life, but a hastily assembled photo op in which a bunch of amateur photographers told him to stand over there, yes, and her to, no, no, not there, in the first row, now, yes, over there, look here, thanks. Click. Click click. Click click click click click. This confusion, well, it confuses Althouse. To wit: I’m judging you [Jessica] by your apparent behavior. It’s not about the smiling, but the three-quarter pose and related posturing, the sort of thing people razz Katherine Harris about. I really don’t know why people who care about feminism don’t have any edge against Clinton for the harm he did to the cause of taking sexual harrassment seriously, and posing in front of him like that irks me, as a feminist. That second point? Beyond reproach. Feminists can and do have reservations about sharing a conference table with someone with Clinton’s reputation. But the first one? Remember all the sluts in the wedding photos? The ones who stood up straight, turned a little to their left or right...</span></a></div>
