The most intelligent reviewers of any thing I watch/read/listen to are always the ones who spend what little free time they have attacking the movies/shows/books/albums they despise. For reasons I don't entirely understand, I believe that there's so much media (in McLuhan's all-encompassing sense of the term) out there it makes no sense to spend one's time hectoring what one dislikes and more time consuming what one likes. Notable exceptions abound, of course, but these are almost exclusively media with agenda, e.g. Left Behind, The Complete Works of Kirk Cameron, etc. (A right-thinking Christian will counter that Will and Grace has a homosexual agenda, and from their perspective it may look that way, but the producers of Will and Grace never, I imagine, sat down and decided to push their homosexual agenda on the American people. They work for NBC. They're capitalists first. So, this right-minded Christian would counter, are the authors/illustrators/producers/Kirk Camerons responsible for Left Behind. True. But whatever else the producers of Will and Grace are, they're not the vanguard of the homosexualization of Christian America in the same way that the folks behind Left Behind are the vanguard of the Christian Right. Don't believe me? Ask Joan Didion.) But I digress. I complain about those who complain not because they complain, no, but because they complain so poorly. They leave in the mouths of complainants a taste that encourages them not to complain in the future. Examples? Reading reviews of Deadwood, a show I've learned to love during my convalescence, Timothy VM &quot;TVM&quot; informs me that [t]he dialogue was ridiculous. I have no problems with the use of &quot;bad&quot; language in movies, but this was extremely juvenile! I would guess that at least half the sentences include the F word at least once. It was so gratuitous, e.g., &quot;I ain't f*cking goin' down stairs!&quot; The story line was very week. D. White Billy, a.k.a. rinkleroot, desires nothing more in life than a Freud SD508 Super Dado Set with Anti-Kickback Design. (Myself, I'm partial to Freud with a little kickback, but to each his own.) D. White Billy wants me to know how puerile and stupid am I for liking a show that really insults a persons intelligence, how difficult is it to write nothing but cussing over and over. Obviously the show is out to attract a very immature audience that thinks cursing is cool. Stay far away from TRASHWOOD!! Actually, the cocksucker's right about one thing: cussin' is fuckin' cool. But Lance Christian &quot;game over man&quot;, whose tag reveals that that's his REAL NAME, laughs at me and &quot;all the people who are so guilable to buy into this.&quot; What are &quot;all the people&quot; buying into these days? According to &quot;game over man,&quot; we're a passel of anti-realists who don't realize that people in &quot;the grittish...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/04/strawberries_un.html"><span><strong>Strawberries Under Ice Stations</strong> I started thinking about writing this earlier today as a Google-cascade of interesting facts overwhelmed me, but as is often the case, further research proves that initial push-to-conclusion built on the poor foundation of coincidence. This reflects, as does everything right now, on my dissertation and the trial of its writing. I want to walk you through this failure not because it's mine, although it is, but because it's representative. I start with an anecdote from this morning: In one of the stranger essays I teach, &quot;Strawberries Under Ice,&quot; David Quammen avoids metaphor and analogy by fiat. First he says Ablation is the scientists' fancy word for loss. Down here the mass balance is negative. Ice is supplied to this zone mainly by flow from above, little or not at all by direct precipitation, and whatever does come as direct precipitation is less than the amount annually lost. The loss results from several different processes: wind erosion, surface melting, evaporation (ice does evaporate), underside melting of an ice shelf where it rests on the warmer seawater. Calving off of icebergs. Calving is the scientists' quaint word for that event when a great hunk of ice--as big as a house, or in some cases, as big as a country--tears away from the leading edge of the sheet or glacier and falls thunderously into the sea. (200) The diction of that first sentence signals the coming metaphor, but instead Quammen relates a process, a few of them actually, through which ablation whittles away at everything from ice cubes to Antarctica. He resists the movement into a metaphorical or analogical register even though he knows his readers will move in that direction: Possibly this talk about calving reflects an unspoken sense that the larger ice mass, moving, pulsing, constantly changing its shape, is almost alive. If so the analogy doesn't go far. Icebergs don't suckle or grow. They float away on the sea, melt, break apart, disappear. Wind erosion and evaporation and most of those other ablative processes work on the ice slowly, incrementally. Calving on the other hand is abrupt. A large piece of the whole is there, and then gone. The strange asyndeton (omission of conjunctions) in the fourth sentence notwithstanding, this paragraph's plain spoken science resists readers' desire to read these glaciological facts as pertaining to Quammen, his life or that much-maligned abstraction, &quot;the human condition.&quot; Calving is a fact of glaciation, not an analogy by which humans can come, metaphorically or analogically, to understand the processes governing their lives. &quot;The analogy,&quot; Quammen insists, &quot;doesn't go far.&quot; So how to explain the article's abrupt shift? I came home to find a note in my door. The note said that a young woman I knew, the great love of a friend of mine, was dead...I learned the woman had died from a fall. A freak accident...She had slipped on a patch of sidewalk ice, the night before, and hit her head. (201) My students, now, are screaming. &quot;CALVING CALVING CALVING THIS...</span></a></div>
