I ask because to the casual observer your background and accolades are rather impressive, yet I can&#39;t help but notice a potent undercurrent of Weltschmerz streaming beneath many of your career-related posts.  </p>

<p>Is it the case that the job market for English PhDs is so competitive and bleak that even ABDs from the nation&#39;s top schools are losing sleep at night?  </p>

<p>I hope these questions are not too personal.  But as someone who is about to begin down a path similar to the one you&#39;re on, I am naturally curious (apprehensive?) about the prospects for fledgling professionals.</p>

<p>Glad to hear lunch with the advisor went well.</p></span>

<p>There aren&#39;t any factors, chief or otherwise, to forecast how well a newly minted Ph.D. will do in the market.  The market&#39;s so variable that in any given year you may have a run on any of the major specializations, say, medievalist, romanticist, Americanist, &amp;c.  But you can&#39;t predict what period will be best represented, nor what emphasis: maybe 20th Century Anglo-American, or American, or minority American, or Meso-American, &amp;c.  But this situation&#39;s so pervasive that it&#39;s not really worth losing sleep over.  I&#39;ve resigned myself to 1) making myself the strongest candidate as possible, 2) making myself as marketable as possible (not the same thing as #1, much to the shame of the profession), and 3) not worrying about things beyond my control (such as the variability of the market year-to-year).  That said, one way to increase your odds of finding a job is to become a medievalist.  Every university needs one, very few students in any program study to be one.  If you&#39;re a <i>good</i> medievalist--by which I mean, you know the literarture, the history and the languages (Latin, medieval Italian, medieval French, medieval Spanish, Provencal, &amp;c.)--like my wife, you&#39;re almost certain to find employment, from what I&#39;ve been told.  I know this isn&#39;t the reassuring answer you wanted (which is why I debated how to answer this for three days), but it&#39;s an honest one.  You become an academic because you want to do the work, live the life, but you have to realize that that life may eventually be comprised of endless composition courses at smaller institutions...even if you do quality work.  One UCI Ph.D., Chris Diffy, recently published in the <i>American Quarterly</i> (I believe that&#39;s where it is) and also has a couple of other publications, is incredibly personable, charming, and exudes intelligence from every pore...and is now a first year law student at Stanford.  (Granted, he earned a free ride to Stanford with some exceptional LSAT scores, but that&#39;s in large part a product of his years of being an English graduate student.)  In other words, as with all professions, coming into this one involves a number of calculated risks.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-8549892-content"><p>Thanks for getting back, Scott.</p>

<p>Your responses are always unpretentious and generous, and that is why I continue to solicit your thoughts.</p>

<p>So is your area of specialization (I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s a strange amalgam of 19th-20th century American lit, critical theory, and social Darwinism) itself a calculated risk?  Should one select an emphasis based upon personal interests and strengths, or upon market demands?  </p>

<p>I ask because if becoming a medievalist is the only safe road to travel, and if that road is one only few decide to venture, what becomes of the vast majority of students who specialize in other, more typically popular areas (Modernism, Victorian lit, Romantic lit, etc.)?  Well, I suppose you&#39;ve already told me:  they teach comp 101 at junior colleges or they enter law school.</p>

<p>The conclusion I&#39;m (perhaps misguidedly) drawing from what you&#39;ve told me is that pursuing a career in academia is in many ways a leap of faith, albeit a calculated leap of faith.  Unlike other professions (law, medicine, K-12 teaching) in which one&#39;s educational background, work experience, and general strengths (professionalism, a robust work ethic, a jovial demeanor) can all but guarantee a job, academia is different.  Academia is more of a crapshoot, and even though it&#39;s one where you can stack the odds very well in your favor, there is always that possibility of earning a PhD from a hallowed institution and ending up jobless.</p>

<p>Please, Scott, when you get a minute or ten, would you inspire some optimism?</p></span>

So little desire to organize. The debate about the debate about the debate about the debate about Theory rages on. (Much, much more below the fold.) I had completed half a post last night in response to this by Jodi Dean: The Right promises a transgressive thrill of racism, sexism, nationalism: enjoy excluding! enjoy 'returning' to the true values, the true text, before it was corrupted by all these women and ethnically identified or figured people, when it was really English and American literature. The point would have been that she psychologizes the reasons people must not &quot;do Theory.&quot; &quot;You don't read Zizek,&quot; I would have had her say, &quot;you must be a closet conservative and crass careerists enraged by your inability to master these difficult works. What other explanation could there be?&quot; I would have then followed with a list of my complaints that would've demonstrated the reason she didn't read any of the articles on which she presumably based her diagnosis is that she already knew what everyone would say (even though she didn't) and already knew why they would say it (even though she doesn't) and that the only way she could continue to write, think and do Theory is if she ignored the fact that legitimate complaints about its usage and purview exist. Then she had to go be polite and reasonable in her response, so I'm not going to write it in the same way Cicero avoided calling attention Quintus' philanderings by informing everyone that he intended avoiding the topic of Quintus' philanderings. Actually, I'm not going to not write it that way either. I'm going to write it as an example of why I think debates about Theory are so often side-tracked: everyone believes everyone else is intellectually dishonest to the limited extent people so deeply stupid can be intellectually dishonest. I know, I know, I'm not breaking new ground here. Here's the thing: I think we're right. All of us. I think we are all intellectually dishonest (to ourselves and others) and deeply stupid when it comes to thinking about Theory. Consider this comment to Jodi's post: Excellent post, and far more gracious than I would have been if I had time to read the related posts, I'm sure. I just have no patience for graduate students, and especially professors, who profess their desire, or anti-desire, for ignorance. Why get into the profession, why claim to profess, if one doesn't want to challenge one's thought, one's way of being? Why not just do the authentic thing, and become a bureaucrat? This is one intellectually dishonest, deeply stupid comment. Its author--who no doubt considers himself as open-minded as critical thinkers come--assumes that anyone who would question the self-evident importance of Theory desires, er, anti-desires ignorance. (Wouldn't an &quot;anti-desire for ignorance&quot; be a desire for knowledge? Nevermind.) Although this professing machine has yet to answer Jodi's latest comment, I wonder how he'll react to this statement: Yet, I am against...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/08/i_would_like_to.html"><span><strong>Bulwark Against an Actual Empire, or another Maginot Line?</strong> I would like to inform everyone that Timothy Burke has christened me &quot;Scott the Merciless.&quot; Really. He did. No he didn't. You caught me. He said: The deeper problem here is something Scott has been pretty merciless about at his own blog and The Valve: a meaningful reading of alliances made and alliances broken requires fidelity to those tools of analytic social science and historicism that theory (poststructuralist and otherwise) mostly abjures or uses in a mood of romantic bemusement. [...] What I'm referring back to is Scott's remarks about the mobility of a cultural studies/theory sense of the politics: its &quot;left&quot; is not any kind of socially incarnated left (save the social habitus of the constituencies drawn to the writing and consumption of theory, which is semi-effaced in the writing of such work). Its sense of left-ness is derived from a mutable, shifting search of representational space for transgression, liminality, culture-war, contestation, whereupon sides are taken, tents are pitched, and a left posture affirmed. Funny how anytime Burke says something it sounds so much more eloquent than when I do. But he has a point: I do think that. This whole conversation has me reliving the week I spent reading nothing but back issues of Critical Inquiry in preparation for the Theory's Empire event. As I moved through them, I found myself attracted to the theoretical stylings of that earlier generation of theorists, none of whom seemed stricken with the unthinking commitment to irrational positions I observe in contemporary theorists. For this reason, Alphonse van Worden's accusation struck me as willfully ignorant and particularly absurd: This may have something to do with rational, good old fashioned Discerning Consumption's loss of market share to faddish Theory. Poor shopwindow display. She describes &quot;Discerning Consumption,&quot; a neologism whose wit sags with every flat iteration, as a desire for a return to something &quot;rational, good old fashioned.&quot; Given my oft-stated position on Derrida (articulated in the essay to which I had linked once and mentioned linking to two other times in that thread) you would think someone interested in condemning it would bother to learn what it is. She didn't. The quickness to condemn despite a dearth of evidence and her determination to remain ignorant of the evidence despite my proferring it is what I've come to expect from self-identified theorists. Others have recently caused me to question the validity of this expectation. But even they sometimes slip into bad habits. Case in point: the current (and ongoing) conversation between Sean, Rich, Jodi and Matt in which I figure as someone who, contra Sean, attempts to take seriously the claims of all participants. Only I'm not &quot;contra Sean.&quot; It's unfair to Sean to ignore his recent (and forthcoming) discussion of Derrida's apocalyptic thought, in which he engages with the text as seriously as Adam praised Abrams for engaging with Derrida's earlier work. Now, as Adam pointed out, there are problems with Abrams' interpretation of Derrida, and there may well be problems wtih Sean's....</span></a></div>
