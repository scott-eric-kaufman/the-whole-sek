<p>As you can tell by the &quot;currently reading&quot; bar sort of directly to the right of this post--probably a scroll or two down as well--I'm &quot;currently reading&quot; T.H. Williams' biography of Louisiana politician extradorinaire Huey Long.&nbsp; A couple of years ago, I taught Sinclair Lewis' novel <em>It Can't Happen Here</em>, a roman a clef of Huey's life.&nbsp; What I failed to realize is how poor a roman a clef it was.&nbsp; It transformed Huey into a dictator of the fascist sort, when he barely resembled the European socialists-in-name-alone-dictators with whom Sinclair compared him.&nbsp; Wish I could admit to being a homer here, but I'm not: Long was a political enigma, but he was no more a fascist than Gandhi...both genuinely wanted to help as many people as possible...except to do so in America requires a sort of pragmatic dictatorial streak.&nbsp; Huey had it.&nbsp; Gandhi didn't.&nbsp; Should we hold that against the Kingfish?&nbsp; Since I'm only about 443 pages into the book, maybe I shouldn't make such bold proclamations, but I will anyway.&nbsp; I'm not afraid of being as wrong as genocide.</p>

<p>So here's a statement typical of the aristocrats Huey opposed:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;The two worst things that ever happened are universal suffrage and universal education.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Huey opposed this.&nbsp; What a fascist.&nbsp; Now, for some of the Kingfish's greatest hits:</p>

<p>When told that nepotism marred his administration--that far too many of his kinfolk were living on the dole--Huey replied that that's only true if you count &quot;ninth cousins, the in-laws and cousins of in-laws,&quot; and hinted that his critics were probably correct, but needed some proof.&nbsp; He suggested they &quot;investigate the rosters of the state penitentiary,&quot; where they'd find &quot;plenty of his kin doling from the pen.&quot;</p>

<p>When his oppoents complained about Huey's entirely legal but non-traditional appointment of delegates to the Democratic National Convention, Huey replied: &quot;No music ever sounded one-half so refreshing as the whines and groans of pie-eating politicians.&nbsp; They say that they were steam-rollered.&nbsp; I think that is true.&nbsp; The only reason that the roller didn't pass over more of them was because there were no more in the way.&quot;</p>

<p>After a particularly heated battle won by Huey, but thought, in the heat of the moment, to have been won by his opponents, the Kingfish declared: &quot;That was a great contest.&nbsp; Give 'em rope.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the man's favored stock phrases: &quot;bosses and bosslets.&quot;&nbsp; I know one of those isn't a word, but fuck me if it oughtn't be.</p>

<p>I could continue, but you ought to read this book.&nbsp; Especially if you're Some Canadian Guy, since Huey is widely acknowledged as being the first U.S. politician to put expertise above political commitment...because the non-political experts in whom he put his faith respected his ability to defer to their expertise.&nbsp; Brilliant. </p>

<p>[Edit:&nbsp; Another 300 pages into the biography, and I can't help but think that Lewis might not've been as wrong as I initially thought.&nbsp; Huey might've been a colorful and egalitarian dictator, but I'm becoming convinced that he was one.&nbsp; More on these pressing developments later.&nbsp; I know you're waiting with baited breath.]<br /> </p>

There I&#39;d be, at 2 a.m. with 7 papers still to grade, reading it.  Or there I&#39;d be, needing to write another couple of dissertation chapters, reading it.  However, as it&#39;s almost the end of the quarter, I should be able to pick it back up soon.  I&#39;d love to talk about it from any number of perspectives: as a work of literary and/or new journalism; as a novel; as a work of social history; as that rarest of Mailer works, i.e. not wholly about himself; etc.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-27810462-content"><p>Huey Long&#39;s historical legacy seems to be stuck in permanent paradox.  Was he a power and money obsessed dictator, or a crusading beneficiary for the poor?  How can a man be both?  The answer lies not so much in his politics but in his psychology.  </p>

<p>Long showed the defining symptoms of Narcissistic Personality Disorder.  Since childhood, he couldn&#39;t stand being second.  Despite a professed populism, he was never part of the crowd, but rather wanted to stand apart with all eyes on him  -- an addict for attention.  But a pathological narcissist can only love his contrived image, which masks a core of self-hate.  Thus, he was distant to his family, living in hotels, and treated his slavish minions with contempt. Fear equaled respect.</p>

<p>Image and reality blurs in a pathological narcissist&#39;s mind, which manifests as a poor sense of personal boundaries.  Indeed, as far as Long was concerned, he was Louisiana.  &quot;I&#39;m the Constitution around here now,&quot; he retorted to a critic.  And being &quot;all good,&quot;  the end justified the means.  Those who disagreed with Long were &quot;all bad,&quot; and thus deserving of his political machine&#39;s extralegal oppression.  A pathological narcissist is threatened by differences of opinion, making compromise almost impossible. It is all about him, and -- without conscience or empathy -- he manipulates others to make sure it is. </p>

<p>So the verdict of history that Long was by nature a dictator is warranted, regardless of his populist sugar-coating to win votes. His presidency would have been a national nightmare.</p></span>
