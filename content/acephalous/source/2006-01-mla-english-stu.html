			<p>Jonathan's <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/nick_gillespie_goes_to_mla/">response</a> to Nick Gillespie's <a href="http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=122705A">first article</a> hits all the notes mine would have.&nbsp; &nbsp;Since Jonathan couldn't attend the &quot;English Studies and Political Literacy&quot; panel Gillespie addresses in his <a href="http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=122805B">second article</a>, I will.&nbsp; Some preliminary remarks:</p>

<p>Gillespie's response contains some cogent remarks about the necessity of what I'll call &quot;the Third Way&quot; in composition and/or critical thinking courses.&nbsp; That the editor of <em>Reason </em>praised <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/">The Valve</a>'s Mark Bauerlein for suggesting that instructors bring <em>Reason </em>magazine into the composition classroom didn't surprise me.&nbsp; What did was that his ideological—one could almost say utopian—commitment to libertarian principles caused him to misdiagnose the etiology and symptomatology of the positions espoused by the panelists.&nbsp; First an example of his utopianism:</p><blockquote><p>Mindich's exam seems
ridiculous on the face of it -- and his view of the FCC as something
other than a negative force on public discourse seems <a href="http://www.reason.com/0503/cr.gg.who.shtml">positively nostalgic</a>.</p>

<p>Certainly, the last 20 years or so -- precisely the period in which
cable and satellite services gave viewers a end-run around the
FCC-regulated broadcast networks -- have seen <a href="http://www.reason.com/0401/fe.bc.domination.shtml">a massive flourishing</a> in all sorts of informational programming.</p></blockquote> <p>The 'Net?&nbsp; Digital cable?&nbsp; Satellite radio?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Corporate consolidation of the aforementioned media?&nbsp; The gutting of regulations designed to create diversity in local and national news outlets?&nbsp; A return to yellow journalism?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Only people who think everyone acquires their news from the internet or expensive cable television packages thinks the 1995 Telecommunications Act had a salutary effect on American media.&nbsp; For the average news consumer it has been an unmitigated disaster: no more local investigative reporters; no more local reporters period; an eighty-five percent increase in the number of &quot;canned&quot; news stories; &amp;c.&nbsp; I could on but I think I've made my point.&nbsp; The privilege subtending the libertarian position undermines its ability to convince me that those who propound it have thought through their statements with eyes not their own. </p>

<p>His blindness to the needs of those who could work themselves to death but never into opportunity focuses his critique on those panelists who suggest government intervention.&nbsp; When he (and most libertarians for that matter) say that structural economic inequalities &quot;hardly neccessitate a massive [social] program,&quot; the first words from my mouth are &quot;What would?&quot;&nbsp; The answer is invariably &quot;an inequality which cannot be better corrected by allowing market forces to run their course.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Such as?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We'll let you know when we find one.&quot;</p>

<p>And there you have the crux of my complaint against rhetorical libertarianism.&nbsp; It can always invoke—sans evidence or with the ever effective feint, borrowed from Communists sympathizers, that we cannot rely on evidence because their philosophy has never been applied in its pure form—the idea that libertarianism <em>could </em>work better than the system we currently have.&nbsp; It could ... but to date deregulation rates a Far From Impressive in the game of practical politics.&nbsp; Wonderful rhetoric and all, but barring the appearance of proof or pudding, color me unconvinced.&nbsp; </p>

<p>All of which is only to say that while his praise of Bauerlein, Kenneth Warren and Patricia Roberts-Miller hits the mark, his criticism of Donald Lazere, Adolf Reed and David Mindich misses.&nbsp; Badly.&nbsp; He attacks them not for the New Left ideology informing their every word but for the quality of their economic arguments.&nbsp; For example, here is his criticism of Lazere's point about the inability to imbue critical thinking skills in students who have no time to read anything but the bare minimum required to pass the course:</p><blockquote><p>And is working a job really antithetical to intellectual and political engagement? I never worked fewer than 30 hours a week during my undergraduate years and still I found plenty of time to kill in the library, engage in wee-hours bull sessions, and indulge in lost weekends.</p></blockquote><p>But students can no longer attend college working 30 hours a week.&nbsp; In &quot;The&nbsp; Pedagogy of Debt&quot;—from a forthcoming issue of <em>College Literature</em>—Jeffrey Williams crunches the inflation-adjusted numbers:</p><blockquote><p>During the 1960s, a student could work 15 hours a week at minimum wage during school and 40 during the summer and pay his or her public university education; at an Ivy or like private school, it would have been about 20 hours a week during school.&nbsp; Now, one would have to work 52 hours a week all year long, even during school; at an Ivy League college you would have to work 136 hours a week all year.</p></blockquote><p>No doubt Gillespie could have worked 106 more hours <em>every </em>week and still succeeded in college.&nbsp; Mere mortals could and can not.&nbsp; Even if they could, all students are not blessed with the gift of perfect understanding.&nbsp; Some must even read books and essays multiple times to understand them fully.&nbsp; Doing so under the constraints which burden many students is impossible.&nbsp; In the end the only students who succeed are those who either 1) had the time to cultivate those skills earlier in life (and therefore did not have to work through high school or care for younger siblings or stay in crowded afterschool programs) or 2) are so naturally gifted that they would have succeeded under any circumstances.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(That the majority of libertarians I know are geniuses of that latter time only reinforces my impression that they lack touch with reality.&nbsp; They believe that because they overcame the odds anyone can.&nbsp; I think their humility honest if self-deluded.&nbsp; The guy who graduated high school at twelve and college at sixteen shouldn't generalize about &quot;what it takes to succeed in the world.&quot;&nbsp; The sole circumstance in which he wouldn't have is an early death.)</p>

<p>Had he not been so focused on what he perceives as the inefficacy of government loans, he would have found far more suitable reasons to reject Lazere and Mindich's proposals.&nbsp; For my money it would be their New Left utopianism, their glorification of the &quot;movement politics&quot; of their youth: sit-ins, teach-ins, and generally &quot;changing the system.&quot;&nbsp; Whereas Ken Warren spoke of the difficulties of changing high school curricula and the ineffectiveness of teaching cultural diversity at the college level—he likened it to Bobby Kennedy's plan to create a more enlightened ruling class—Lazere, Mindich and Reed all spoke against the corporate and/or institutional structures which <em>necessarily </em>prevented a student from thinking for him/herself.&nbsp; The anti-statist, anti-bureaucratic and anti-organizational biases of the New Left determined how these thinkers reacted to problem of teaching political literacy.&nbsp; <br />The reason Gillespie refused to attack these three on these grounds should be obvious: they correspond neatly with the anti-statist, anti-bureaucratic and anti-organizational biases of contemporary libertarianism.&nbsp; Did he hope to not confuse his audience?</p>

<p>Did he think them insufficiently literate in politics to catch the distinction?</p>

MT asks: You seem to be running into and attending talks by bloggers. How largely does the blogosphere loom at the MLA? And is it a sort of inside secret of those who blog and read blogs, or is it something that pretty much anybody is liable to mention? On the one hand, all the academic bloggers sought each other out. Even if they blog anonymously. The reason being that the MLA can be a terribly alienating experience. The horror stories I heard about the isolation and loneliness of attending day after day of panels in rooms full of strangers never materialized for me. Not because (like &quot;name&quot; academics) everyone knew me and sought me out, but because academic bloggers arrived with the community in their laptop. Time after time we referenced entries we had written in the same way that old friends swap war stories of high school or undergraduate life. I had never met any of these people (except for Sean) before, but I felt like I'd come to know how they think in a way guaranteed to assuage the tiny-fish-in-an-oceanic-pond scenario which so many other graduate students experienced. I see one objection to this scenario: The aforementioned &quot;name&quot; academics have many important friends who they have worked alongside for decades. Surely they are genuinely happy to see each other. That is certainly the case. But consider the difference between the &quot;relationship&quot; of the average blogger to his or her fellow bloggers. They don't only think about them when they stumble across their name in a manuscript or see a particularly meaningful stain on an old sweater. Bloggers actively seek each other out on a regular basis. They make concerted efforts to see what their cohorts have thought about. When I met Holbo we shook hands and immediately picked up one of the ongoing conversations we'd been having. When I met Clancy, I asked her about some of her recent posts and immediately challenged her to an MLA-live-blogging duel. (Which despite disappointing early returns, I clearly one. You'd almost think she had interviews to attend or something.) When I walked into Holbo's Zizek panel and stood uncomfortably just inside the door, Amardeep tugged on my shirt and pointed at his badge and I was suddenly comfortable. The strange thing is that our relationships are all academic at heart, but the medium encourages a different mode of relating to fellow academics. For proof of this I saved my best example for last: John and I emailed one of the most well-respected scholars at the MLA and asked if he wanted to meet up. Now they don't make them any nicer than Bérubé, but if John and I were simply scholars he had exchanged a few emails with over the past year, I doubt he would've offered to meet with meet us after a four hour marathon of an Executive Council meeting and before what would...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/01/firefox_questio.html"><span><strong>Firefox Question (SOLVED!)</strong> Appropos of nothing: Last night one of my cats fell asleep on my keyboard while I had Firefox open. Now Page Up and Page Dn refuse to work because the cursor controls everything. For example, when I'm on a page, I can move the cursor up and down and it'll stop on each line of text and before every picture in the left column, then move to the center, then to the right. But if I hit Page Dn the screen jumps. I've fiddle around with Firefox for past hour trying to correct this but cannot find the setting. Any help would be much appreciated. UPDATE: Solved! Apparently my cat favors Caret browsing. Too bad for him.</span></a></div>
