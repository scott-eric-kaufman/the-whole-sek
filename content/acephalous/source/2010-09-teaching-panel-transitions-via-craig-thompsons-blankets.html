<p>I begin the quarter teaching excerpts from Scott McCloud&#39;s <em>Understanding Comics </em>and <em>Making Comics</em>&#0160;not because all arguments about comic form and content end with the theories contained therein, but because 1) his terms have come to define the debate and 2) they are damn useful in setting up classroom debates. &#0160;(My students don&#39;t realize that they frequently recapitulate the scholarly arguments inspired by the book, but they do.) &#0160;The basic idea behind this exercise is to get them to understand that <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/10/on-informing-your-students-that-theyre-murderers.html" target="_self">they&#39;re all murderers</a> and the only way they&#39;ll get their heads out of the gutters is figure out how to move from one panel to the next. &#0160;First I provide the McCloud:</p>

<p>Then I follow it with an example from their text, in this case&#0160;Craig Thompson&#39;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1891830430/diesekoschmar-20" target="_self">Blankets</a></em>:</p>

<p>You&#39;ll note that I haven&#39;t included an obvious example of a moment-to-moment transition here, but that&#39;s because I want them to understand from the get-go that this terminology is flexible. &#0160;In this case, I would argue that this is moment-to-moment on two accounts: the first would be conventional McCloud, because in the gutter between the those panels the reader must imagine Phil squirm until he can spot the &quot;sharks&quot; on the floor beside the bed. &#0160;My assumption here is that &quot;squirming&quot; represents &quot;a single action&quot; and Thompson portrays its constituent parts, but my assumption is also an assertion that students can (and tomorrow will be forced to) take issue with.</p>
<p>For example, it could be argued that &quot;squirming&quot; is an indivisible act and that, as such, it cannot be broken down into a series of moments (although the very existence of these panels would seem to indicate otherwise). &#0160;Here as elsewhere, the poor fit between McCloud&#39;s term and Thompson&#39;s text works to my advantage: something cannot simply be said to be something. &#0160;It must be argued. &#0160;The same difficulties arise with McCloud&#39;s next transition:</p>

<p>What is the subject of this panel? &#0160;Is it Thompson or the blood on his hands? &#0160;An argument can made be for either (though obviously one is more interesting the the other). &#0160;I could continue in this vein, but I want my students to figure this out on their own and not simply repeat what I write on the blog. &#0160;With that in mind, I will simply present the last examples (minus non-sequitur for Thompson-specific reasons I&#39;ll cover later) in the order in which they will appear on the wall. &#0160;Feel free to knock them (and me) about in the comments. &#0160;Here goes:</p>

Or only differently. It contains statements like: That the people planning the prank—O’Keefe included—know that O’Keefe’s normal persona (or “personality”) is “sleazy” shows improved judgment on their part, at least as concerns character. Association? Not so much. Most reasonable people would rather not associate with someone they consider sleazy. They also seem to have a problem with hyphens and parallelism (or a very odd notion of what goes on necklaces), but grammar is less significant than the fact that they believed she would fall for something “entirely over the top.” Going over the top, much less “entirely over the top,” involves creating situations that cross beyond the boundary of believability and into the realm of the unbelievable. The unbelievable (yet merely exaggerated) persona O’Keefe would have employed wouldn’t have been an element of the prank so much as its undoing. Even if circumstances conspired such that his dress and demeanor didn’t tip Abbie Boudreau off—for example, she could have gone to an eye doctor for an ear infection and boarded the boat with her ears plugged and eyes dilated—the room he had planned for her quickly would: The only possible conclusion is that they never planned to prank her but merely wanted enough footage so that they could later edit to make it appear as if they pranked her. They come out and say as much: All they want to do is “keep her on the boat” long enough to score footage for some future redaction. They even wrote a script in which the “catalytic [sic] moment” would be having Boudreau call O’Keefe’s unprofessional behavior what it clearly is: I’m sure they had some entirely unrelated matter against which to juxtapose her accurate assessment of O’Keefe’s behavior, but as that will inevitably be juxtaposed against some other entirely unrelated matter, I think we should all focus on what this lot thought their joke would prove: I don’t want to be the guy who “writes” posts that consist mostly of photographs, but since they speak for themselves, here are the “hot blondes” who work at CNN: And here are the “hot blondes” who work at O’Keefe’s de facto employer: The fact that I had to make the CNN one myself whereas the FOX was alreadyfloating around out there makes me wonder what tables they thought they were turning (and on whom)?</span></a></div>
