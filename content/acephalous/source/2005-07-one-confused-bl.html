			<p>Before I continue answering Mike's questions, I want to thank all thirty-six of you who emailed me last night for the sole purpose of informing me that my academic career can survive the occasional infelicitous sentence.&nbsp; Why you chose to <em>email </em>me instead of leaving your logic in the comment box is something I could think about, but Bill Pannapacker captures, if not the fact (as <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/is_there_a_fucking_knife_in_this_class/">some have argued</a>), then at least the mind-set that would compel people to console my idiotic fears privately:</p><blockquote><p>Blogs are a useful tool for people on the margins of the profession.
They help to break up the control of editorial boards and conference
committees over the acceptable range of professional discourse. But it
will be a long time before they are regarded as a legitimate venue for
scholarly discussion; participation in them is not likely to help, and
it could do a lot to harm one's career, if that is what matters most.</p></blockquote><p>Let me be the first to admit that I think the nerve Pannapacker touched is raw for a reason: we really don't know what we're doing.&nbsp; We <em>are</em> on the margins of academia (or, in <a href="http://www.pseudopodium.org/">Ray's case</a>, beyond them), and we are inclined to dance when someone questions the validity and viability of what we're doing.&nbsp; (Not that Pannapacker said or implied that; any consideration of what we are or aren't doing strikes the same nerve.&nbsp; It's not his fault we're so jumpy.)&nbsp; By &quot;<em>we</em> are on the margins of the academy,&quot; I don't mean to imply that we're all on the same margins.&nbsp; McCann's a force in the field and Holbo and the Miriams are internet celebrities.&nbsp; Jonathan, um, Jonathan's Jonathan.&nbsp; His position's so cryptic as to defy description.&nbsp; (But I suspect he too is an internet celebrity.&nbsp; Only incognito.)&nbsp; And then there's me.&nbsp; I'm writing a dissertation.&nbsp; I've never been published.&nbsp; I'm not on the margins so much as the testing grounds.&nbsp; Will I succeed?&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; I don't anticipate ticker-tape parades, but I clench my fists in futile prayer that I'll land a job somewhere someday.</p>

<p>Different from my dissertation.</p>

<p>Different from my blog.</p>

<p>And that's <em>precisely</em> the point of Pannapacker's essay.&nbsp; I think the response of my fellow Valveteers is as much a reaction to our own anxiety about what exactly it is we're producing as Pannapacker's generous and flattering article.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Pannapacker&#39;s column seemed more about his personal sensibility than anything else.

		<span id="comment-7673243-content"><p>Jonathan, I know you don&#39;t share the ASLC&#39;s position.  Everytime I look around technorati to see what people are saying about the Valve, I find your footprints and a comment to that effect.  While I realize that you have a valid concern that people will learn of your association with it and judge you accordingly, I believe those who would do that <i>without taking the time to actually read anything you&#39;ve written on the Valve</i> are the problem.  </p>

<p>As for your posts not being cryptic, well, you&#39;re right about your <i>TE</i> posts, but you&#39;ve said yourself that &quot;<a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/an_exceptionally_brief_yet_important_addition_to_a_common_gloss/#2034" rel="nofollow">I have many obscure interests, and one of my favorite forms of humor is to pretend that they’re not obscure</a>.&quot;  That&#39;s the damn near the definition of cryptic.</p></span>

Screams, Runs Around, Then Screams Some More</strong> So I'm quoted in the most recent issue of the Chronicle of Higher Education. No big deal. Only the way I've been quoted makes me sound like I don't know English. To answer your question: I'm screaming on the inside.</span></a></div>

Throw cats off bed. Return to sleep. 7:06 Awake to cats wrestling on head. Throw cats off bed. Throw self off bed. Stumble into kitchen. Prepare mug of green tea. 7:15 Grab magazine from pile near chair. Read articles and note which are 1) of general interest and 2) of pedagogical value. 7:55 Shower. Rebel against rinse repeat. 8:00 Greet wife. Eat breakfast while watching Tivo of previous evening's Daily Show. Laugh. Feel powerless to alter the course of history. Laugh again. 8:25 Inform wife it is &quot;time to get to work.&quot; Walk into bedroom/study. Make bed while computer boots. Douse room in lavender-scented Febreze fabric refresher. 8:26 Read email. Answer urgent missives. 8:27 Curse dearth of urgent missives. Question own self-importance. 8:28 Open 192 windows in Mozilla. Read news of Mets' latest late-inning collapse. Observe that 412 strangers read blog while I slept. Begin rebuilding sense of self-importance. 8:35 Decide today will not be the day every newspaper in America will be read. Close 191 windows. Leave &quot;stats&quot; page of blog open in case sense of self-importance flags. 8:36 Time to dissertate! Stare at piles of books. Read through last four or five pages written yesterday. Despair at own stupidity. Stare at piles of books. 9:41 Work up nerve to select books from piles. Choose this one and, um, that one. Open selected books. Attempt to decipher own marginalia. Curse self for poor penmanship. 10:14 Retype final four paragraphs written day before in failed attempt to remind self what self had in mind when self spent 12 hours writing gibberish. Begin to compose this entry. Wonder why &quot;gibberish&quot; spelled with &quot;g&quot; instead of &quot;j&quot; when &quot;jibber-jabber&quot; spelled with &quot;j.&quot; Feel annoyed at trivial turn of mind. Return to retyping final four paragraphs written previous day. 10:37 Finish &quot;the retype.&quot; Understand what was written. Understand what was written to be stupid. Despair! 10:39 Cease hyperventilation. Open new window in Mozilla. Read the Valve. 10:40 Read response to recent article mentioning Y.T. Consider potential post about being known by full name. Think of mother yelling &quot;Scott Eric Kaufman&quot; to alter deviant behavior. Wonder if people who read this entry will be reminded of Ben Marcus. Wonder if readers familiar with work of Ben Marcus. Decide to inform readers that excerpt from The Age of Wire and String available below fold.[1] 10:59 Return to dissertation. Remember general bearings of train-of-thought. Ride the rails. 1:13 Eat lunch. Converse with wife. Commiserate with wife about current conditions in sinuses. Remind wife of recent bout of cancer in order to diminish wife's suffering. Evoke pity from the ill. Feel like horrible person. 1:21 Finish lunch. Apologize for 19,482 time for lording cancer over wife. Acknowledge that past suffering does not diminish...</span></a></div>
