			<p>Since 1) I have nothing better to do on a Saturday afternoon besides grade 170 essays and 2) <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/03/dear-cowardly-anonymous-commenters">we&#39;ve been talking about trolls and trolling</a> of late, I thought, &quot;Scott, you should troll your own blog!&quot; So here goes:</p>
<p>After watching last night&#39;s episode of <em>Fringe</em> and consulting the deep recesses of my nerdy soul, I&#39;m going to declare that <em>Fringe</em> is very close to eclipsing <em>The Wire</em> as the best English-language television show I&#39;ve ever watched. That final conditional means I&#39;m not going to include shows from the dark days of network television, because I&#39;ve seen more silent films than I have episodes of <em>Hill Street Blues</em> or <em>Airwolf</em>. Now, I know you&#39;re going to complain that <em>Fringe</em> opened as an <em>X-Files</em> clone and didn&#39;t evolve into anything interesting until midway through its second season -- when, threatened with cancellation, the writers decided that if they were going to be cancelled, they may as well do so on their own terms -- whereas <em>The Wire</em>&#39;s first season was a well-orchestrated slow-burn, and I&#39;m not going to disagree. But what I appreciate about <em>Fringe</em> is that it&#39;s become what it is despite itself. Or maybe I&#39;m just being unduly presentist. Either way, here&#39;s my list:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Fringe</em> (technically 1a)</li>
<li><em>The Wire</em>&#0160;(technically 1b)</li>
<li><em>Deadwood</em></li>
<li><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></li>
<li><em>Mad Men</em></li>
<li>The first season of <em>Twin Peaks</em></li>
<li>The only season of<em> Firefly</em></li>
<li><em>Seinfeld</em></li>
<li>Every episode except the series finale of <em>Battlestar Galactica</em></li>
<li><em>Doctor Who</em></li>
<li>The first and second seasons of <em>Homicide</em>, as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_(Homicide:_Life_on_the_Street)" target="_self">that episode with Vincent D&#39;Onofrio</a></li>
<li>The UK version of <em>Prime Suspect</em></li>
<li>The first season of the American version of <em>In Treatment</em></li>
<li>The second and final seasons of <em>Angel</em></li>
<li>The UK version of <em>Life on Mars</em></li>
<li><strong>UPDATE:&#0160;</strong>Shows some idiot neglected to include on this list include:&#0160;<em><em>Arrested Development</em></em>; the second, third and fourth seasons of<em>&#0160;<em>Babylon 5</em></em>;&#0160;<em>Breaking Bad</em>; the UK version of&#0160;<em>The Office</em>; <em>Freaks and Geeks</em>; <em>Leverage</em>;&#0160;and ...<em><br /></em></li>
</ol>
<p>Plus all the ones I forgot or couldn&#39;t stomach including, like the Michael Moriarty episodes of Law &amp; Order, which have been retroactively ruined by his crazy Canadian racism. I imagine I&#39;ve forgotten quite a few, but I&#39;m just as (if not more) interested in discovering and/or being reminded of items not included above.</p>

<p>Veronica Mars (1st or 2nd Season, depending on your tastes)?</p>

<p>Carnivale?</p>

<p>Breaking Bad?</p>

<p>I only really enjoyed the first season of Mad Men. After that it was fun to _look_ at, but I totally lost interest in Don Draper after that.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed Veronica Mars, but I realize it&#39;s not everyone&#39;s cup of tea.</p>

<p>Not sure it belongs on my list, but my favorite guilty pleasure was....Gilmore Girls. I am prepared for any and all mocking.</p></span>

Seriously, sit through the first season and take my word, it&#39;ll be worth the pain.</p></span>

<p>LGM! (I don&#39;t specify I x-post anymore, because I like my different audiences to be, um, different, but I did address that there.)</p>

<p><em>Also, if you&#39;re going to limit yourself to subsections of shows&#39; runs, I think it&#39;s fair to say that only seasons 2-5 of Buffy really qualify.</em></p>

<p>I should&#39;ve gone with more <em>Angel</em> and qualified &quot;Once More, With Feeling&quot; with <em>Buffy</em> and stopped at the fifth season. However, if I had, Rick Perlstein wouldn&#39;t have told me that I don&#39;t suck at lists, I&#39;m actually very modern in my desire to crowd-source away my ignorance, so there&#39;s that, um, consolation?</p></span>

<p>I know, it&#39;s almost like I&#39;m not the goofiest motherfucker most people know, and yet ... I have levels.</p>

<p><em>while I understand that crosslinking is tedious, after the first day or so it&#39;s very useful. At least, if you&#39;re gonna cite the crosspost in comments, link then. Not for us regulars, so much as for posterity, or irregulars.</em></p>

<p>I actually like having the two communities though. I receive vastly different sorts of feedback from them, and I&#39;ve come to value that. When I compose material, I&#39;m actually addressing two audiences. It&#39;s why I don&#39;t x-post everything, too.</p>

<p><em>What is the entertainment value of &quot;Fringe&quot;? I&#39;ve hardly ever heard anyone mention it positively, much less explain why they were watching it. Would it have any entertainment value for someone who despised the soap opera/global alien conspiracy elements of X-Files?</em></p>

<p>I can&#39;t answer the first question without spoiling the series, so I won&#39;t. But I can answer the second: because it&#39;s not a soap opera-cum-global alien conspiracy, it&#39;s brilliantly executed high tragedy performed by actors with the chops to pull it off. In all seriousness, last night&#39;s episode was, by all accounts, <em>slight</em>, and yet it worked. Put differently: they&#39;ve approached and/or pulled off the equivalent of the end of the second season of <em>Buffy</em> about nine times now.</p></span>

<p>I respect that, though I don&#39;t exactly see a balance in your responsiveness. But by definition, then, if you&#39;re going to cite the other discussion here, you have to assume that this readership may not immediately know where to go for the other discussion. </p>

<p><i>the equivalent of the end of the second season of Buffy</i></p>

<p>Can you translate that into Star Trek units? Or is that a geek too far? </p></span>

<p>Gas: Community&#39;s not quite up there with Arrested Development yet, and I forgot to include either on the list, because I&#39;ve the memory of a toddler in need of Ritalin. But as for a BSG finale post, I&#39;ve got two Mad Men posts in the works for tomorrow night, then a Game of Thrones, then I&#39;ll hit up the BSG finale, if I can stomach it.

In fact, you&#39;re the only other person I know besides my spouse who has seen the damn thing.  Even my UK friends haven&#39;t.  One of these days we need to get together and waxed rhapsodic about that show.</p>

<p>And like JME, I&#39;m suprised Veronica Mars isn&#39;t on this list (and not just because it has Mars in the title).</p>

<p>I, too, have been *loving* Fringe lately, but have to laugh at the &quot;Pacey and Denethor&quot; refs JME makes, because even though we&#39;ve been watching it from the beginning, the spouse and I also tend to refer to those actors by those names.</p>

<p>As for the value of it (to answer Ahistoricality), one of the things I love about the show is it&#39;s by far one of the best portrayals of a vexed father-son relationship ever.  It uses the sci-fi framework brilliantly to avoid schlocky sentimentality.  And it does the same with a very grown-up love relationship, too.</p></span>

Behind him are three young men with shave heads and many muscles. MARINE #1: Yo! Marines? MARINE #2: ARE AWESOME! MARINE #3: Every member of the other armed forces is a giant weeping vagina compared to– ALL THREE: MARINES! SEK ascertains that these strapping young men must be Marines. He proceeds through the checkpoint with no problem, so too do the first two MARINES. TSA AGENT: (to the third MARINE) Sir, can I ask you to step aside? MARINE #3: (looking perplexed) Me? TSA AGENT: Yes sir. The TSA AGENT pulls a Paul Hogan “Now THIS is a knife” from the third MARINE’s carry-on. MARINE #3: You can’t take that! It’s my graduation blade! SEK would tell you what happened next, but loitering around security checkpoints while sporting a beard is a bad idea even if you’re a Jew.</span></a></div>

Among a few interesting items uncovered in trying to examine the facts behind the shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin without drawing any conclusions, was that a widely viewed photograph of Martin appears to have been altered, somewhat. Here is what appears to be the original via the Miami Herald. The one below has been observed in the media and at forums such as Democracy Now. Clearly, it has been lightened, or softened, somehow. Along with other possible alterations, he looks far more, perhaps innocent is the right word, in the altered image. Dan Riehl believes that if you &quot;lighten&quot; an image -- that is, if you contribute to the impression that there's a possibility that the person in the photograph may be white -- that person &quot;looks far more ... innocent.&quot; So: White people? Innocent. Darkies? Guilty. Just look at them. They're &quot;technically thugs,&quot; and therefore deserve to be shot by gun-toting racists who've made 46 calls to 911 complaining about &quot;suspicious&quot; darkies engaging in activities such as walking in and out of their parents' open garages or playing soccer in the street. I won't republish them here, but I exchanged a series of emails with Riehl -- who's more than welcome to republish my replies, if he so desires -- after I called him a racist for being afraid of seventh graders who were only &quot;technically thugs.&quot; His defense was that I would've been afraid too, which tells you all you need to know about Dan Riehl. That he worked for and admired Andrew Brietbart and supports the political theater of James O'Keefe is entirely beside the point, except that it isn't. He's a racist parading his denial with all the subtlety of someone who dons a &quot;GOD HATES FAGS&quot; sign at a Marine's funeral. And just as classy, too.</span></a></div>
