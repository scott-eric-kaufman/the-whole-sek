        <meta name="description" content="I woke up this morning with an idea in my skull. I'd dreamed I was sitting on a bench, in Baltimore, facing the tumbling fountain in Harlem Park, beside a woman who wore a veil. I had come there with her. She was somebody I knew well. But I had suddenly forgotten who she was. I asked her if she had finished grading the papers. She answered me, but the roar and swish of the tumbling fountain smothered her voice, and I could hear nothing. The dream ended there. I walked into the kitchen, opened the top of the refigerator and attacked the ice tray. The girl stood in the doorway and asked questions. I didn't answer them while I put ice, lemon juice and seltzer together in two glasses. I put my glass on the table, sat down facing it, and complained. She reached across the table and patted my hand. Her eyes were uneasy. She smiled too softly and spoke too indulgently: &quot;You exaggerate so, honey. Those kids deserve all they get.&quot; I grinned, picked up the glasses, and went out to the kitchen for more seltzer. When I came back she frowned at me over anxious dark eyes and said: &quot;The trouble with you is your nerves are shot. You've been through too many papers in the last few days. Keep it up and you're going to have a nervous breakdown.&quot; I held up a hand with spread fingers. It was steady enough. She looked at it and said: &quot;That doesn't mean anything. It's inside you. Why don't you sneak off for a couple of days' rest?&quot; &quot;Can't sister. Somebody's got to stay here and grade the papers.&quot; Her eyes got large and then narrowd to black-fringed slits. She leaned toward me, upsetting her glass with an elbow: &quot;Then let's talk scratch.&quot; I grinned at the greed in her eyes and said: &quot;Not just yet. We'll have to see how you work out before we start scattering pennies around.&quot; She called me a damned nickle-nurser. I grinned and handed her a paper from the stack. She pretended it took her nearly five minutes to read the fifteen hundred words the kid had written. I gave her my fountain pen and held a notebook under the paper, to stiffen it while she scribbled her comments at the bottom, and to have it in my hands as soon as she had finished. I looked it over and said: &quot;You can't tell some kid that.

			<p>I woke up this morning with an idea in my skull.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I'd dreamed I was sitting on a bench, in Baltimore, facing the tumbling fountain in Harlem Park, beside a woman who wore a veil.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I had come there with her.&nbsp; She was somebody I knew well.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But I had suddenly forgotten who she was.&nbsp; I asked her if she had finished grading the papers.&nbsp; She answered me, but the roar and swish of the tumbling fountain smothered her voice, and I could hear nothing.</p>

<p>The dream ended there.</p>

<p>I walked into the kitchen, opened the top of the refigerator and attacked the ice tray.&nbsp; The girl stood in the doorway and asked questions.&nbsp; I didn't answer them while I put ice, lemon juice and seltzer together in two glasses.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I put my glass on the table, sat down facing it, and complained.&nbsp; She reached across the table and patted my hand.&nbsp; Her eyes were uneasy.&nbsp; She smiled too softly and spoke too indulgently:</p>

<p>&quot;You exaggerate so, honey.&nbsp; Those kids deserve all they get.&quot;</p>

<p>I grinned, picked up the glasses, and went out to the kitchen for more seltzer.&nbsp; When I came back she frowned at me over anxious dark eyes and said:</p>

<p>&quot;The trouble with you is your nerves are shot.&nbsp; You've been through too many papers in the last few days.&nbsp; Keep it up and you're going to have a nervous breakdown.&quot;</p>

<p>I held up a hand with spread fingers.&nbsp; It was steady enough.</p>

<p>She looked at it and said:</p>

<p>&quot;That doesn't mean anything. It's inside you.&nbsp; Why don't you sneak off for a couple of days' rest?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can't sister.&nbsp; Somebody's got to stay here and grade the papers.&quot;</p>

<p>Her eyes got large and then narrowd to black-fringed slits.&nbsp; She leaned toward me, upsetting her glass with an elbow:</p>

<p>&quot;Then let's talk scratch.&quot;</p>

<p>I grinned at the greed in her eyes and said:</p>

<p>&quot;Not just yet.&nbsp; We'll have to see how you work out before we start scattering pennies around.&quot;</p>

<p>She called me a damned nickle-nurser.&nbsp; I grinned and handed her a paper from the stack.&nbsp; She pretended it took her nearly five minutes to read the fifteen hundred words the kid had written.&nbsp; I gave her my fountain pen and held a notebook under the paper, to stiffen it while she scribbled her comments at the bottom, and to have it in my hands as soon as she had finished.</p>

<p>I looked it over and said:</p>

<p>&quot;You can't tell some kid that.&nbsp; Where were you raised?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was raised in a convent,&quot; she told me.&nbsp; &quot;I won the good behavior prize every year I was there.&nbsp; I thought little girls who put extra spoons of sugar in their chocolate went to hell for gluttony.&nbsp; I didn't even know there was such a thing as profanity until I was eighteen.&nbsp; The first time I heard any I damn near fainted.&quot;</p>

<p>She let me look her over, having all sorts of confidence in her belief that, like a lot of people, she looked most honest when she was lying.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&quot;I'm not lying to you, Scott.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like hell you're not,&quot; I said and stood up.</p>

<p> She leaned forward, made her eyes small, and said:</p>

<p>&quot;The next best thing for you to do if you won't let me mark them and you won't go away is to get plastered and forget everything for a few hours.&quot;</p>

<p>I turned and looked at the clock.&nbsp; Ten minutes past nine o'clock.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I left princess at the table and got into a tub of cold water.&nbsp; It braced me a lot, and I needed bracing.&nbsp; At eighteen I could get along on gin as a substitute for sleep, but not comfortably.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I'm not eighteen anymore.&nbsp; </p>

<p>When I had dressed I walked back into the kitchen.&nbsp; I made and drank two cups of coffee.&nbsp; With the sigh of a tired child I picked up the top paper on the stack and started grading . . . </p>

	<div class="content-nav-prev"><div class="content-nav-label">NEXT POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/internal_email_.html"><span><strong>EXTRA!  EXTRA!  READ ALL ABOUT IT!</strong> The following is an email The Acephalous Sun recently acquired: Dear SmartPodiums &quot;Я&quot; Us: We here at the Instructional Resource Center would like you to modify the Model-T51789 SmartPodium previously installed in HIB 110. The specific alterations we request are: When an instructor presses the &quot;up&quot; button on podium touchscreen the cursor should move down and when &quot;down&quot; is pressed it should move up. Similarly when the instructor presses &quot;right&quot; the cursor should move left and when &quot;left&quot; is pressed it should move right. Every time an instructor touches the touchscreen it should emit a shrill &quot;beep&quot; to inform the students that their instructor has touched it. If possible we would like it to randomly emit multiple beeps despite being touched only once. That &quot;beep&quot; should not correllate to the cursor moving in the opposite of the desired direction. The cursor should only move when it wants to. But the SmartPodium should beep everytime the instructor touches it. And sometimes when he doesn't. We also request a camera with video capability be secreted in or next to the touchscreen. It should be programmed to record whenever the touchscreen is activated. Once completed the SmartPodium should automatically email the recorded video to the email addresses specified in previous correspondence. We hope these modifications can be completed before 16 February 2006. Thank you again for your willingness to go the extra mile for the IRC. P.S. If you would like your email added to the aforementioned mailing list we'd be more than happy to oblige. Watching these idiots cajole then threaten your quality podiums is all the meaning we can muster from our tiny little lives.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/02/no_more_online_.html"><span><strong>No.  More.  Online.  Child.  Pornography.  Please.</strong> Observe the list of articles my students could have written about. It didn't occur to me that one-third of them would choose Kurt Eichenwald's &quot;Through His Webcam, a Boy Joins a Sordid World Online.&quot; Maybe I should have foreseen it. I didn't. Now I've spend all weekend reading about &quot;camwhores&quot; and the ethical issues involved in writing about them. Before assigning this article I should've considered whether I wanted to spend two or three days thinking about thirteen year old Justin Berry's descent into a world of online pedophilia and molestation and Mexicon hookers. Because if I had I may have balked at assigned this particular article. Instead I find myself writing sentences like &quot;As you note, Eichenwald regularly suggests that Berry wasn't responsible for his decisions, that from the moment he turned on his webcam he was doom to masturbate in front of it for pedophiles.&quot; Not that the topic is unimportant or that, as has been recently suggested, I'm a prude. I work on evolutionary theory. I think about sexual reproduction all the time. I've T.A.'d for courses which examined questions of normative sexuality. I'm not the least bit uncomfortable with the material. But . . . ugh.</span></a></div>
