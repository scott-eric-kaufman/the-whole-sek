        <meta name="description" content="Via Christopher Shea comes news that will surprise no one I've talked to since returning to the States: Irish drinkers lead the EU in the proportion of those drinking that have 3-4 drinks (35%) or 5-6 drinks (19%). As 5 or more drinks as the threshold for binge drinking, the Irish Times hails our success in binge drinking. But wait. Binge drinking is 5 or more drinks. It's true we lead Europe in the category of very precise binge drinking, i.e. 5 or 6. But you have to look at all consumption over 5 drinks. For Ireland there's another 5% who have 7-9, and 2% who have 10 or more. Total percentage of bingers: 19+5+2=26%. For the UK: 12% have 5-6, and 6% have 7-9, 6% have 10 or more. So 12+6+6=24% are binge drinkers. I spent more than a few evenings in London stunned stupid by the prodigious quantities of alcohol everyone around me was consuming. I'm not simply talking about London toughs either, but professional men and women who stepped in the pub on their way home from work intent on crawling out of it seven hours later stained and debased. If their infamous reserve is roughly equivalent to the Freudian superego, I would say that it performs its role quite admirably until the moment it inexplicably abdicates its responsibilities and allows the id to do what it will. And will it ever. The abuse that streams from their formerly stiff upper lips is more foul than anything this side of Deadwood. That polite archeology student in the hipster sailor suit you were talking to ten minutes ago? He no longer remembers who you are, but is damn sure you gave him mortal offense and insists on taking it outside before disappearing down the bar. When he returns a moment later he promptly introduces himself. Now I'm not unfamiliar with the levels of public intoxication and its attendant calls to violence I witnessed in England, but keep in mind that this is April and the Krewe of Bacchus is nowhere in sight. When your nightly ritual resembles nothing so much as Mardi Gras, it might be time to consider cutting back on your cups. Harsh criticism from a guest to be sure, but it's not like I'm an evangelical teetotaler. I end my days with a vodka-something or two (depending on how stressful being awake has been) and am in no position to lecture other people about the manner or amount they drink, which is mostly my point: when someone like me marvels at the manner and amount of drink a given people consume, something is seriously wrong with the world. Because when people in no position to criticize anyone are flabbergasted into embracing their own hypocrisy it means you have a problem." />

<p>Well, try and put away what a UK mature student union hacktivist in Bloomsbury throws down in an average evening. I tried that for a few months last year, and am still regretting it.</p></span>

Was at my daughter&#39;s primary school yesterday, waiting near the office while my wife paid the lunch money for the term. Other mums in a circle, talking about what they did with their Easter breaks, turned instantly into mega-hangover comparisons. &quot;I still can&#39;t see straight, four days later, and am headed home to be sick in the toilet.&quot; &quot;Right, well, my husband and I were thrown out of Greece for fouling their pavements the morning after the second to last night...&quot; </p>

<p>These were moms of four year olds, mind you. Four year olds who were on the trips with them. </p>

I spent the majority of my time in London on a walking tour without purpose. For example, one time I walked from Crouch End, in the north of London, into Soho, which is nearly eight miles away in the heart of the city. A different day found me trekking from Crouch End to Ford Street, which is also nearly eight miles away, in search of this gift for my wife. So as I sat in Heathrow yesterday awaiting my return flight,* I found it fitting all the televisions were broadcasting the I don't normally watch marathons, but in the terminal I felt as if these world class athletes who bore the name of my airline on their chests were running for me. It felt as though, in a mere three hours, they had kindly recapitulated my weeks of flânerie so that I might better remember the street feel a city I may never step foot in again. *Whose existence remains dubious despite convincing evidence to the contrary.</span></a></div>

The following will not be a typical post. As friends of Scott Kaufman already know, even conservative forecasters believe there's a better than 50 percent chance that a perfect storm of hilarious fatality will strike Kaufman down tomorrow. Consider: because he missed four consecutive classes on account of an ornery volcano, Kaufman must trek down to Irvine tomorrow no matter what. However, due to the merger of the cold he acquired in England with an opportunistic sinus infection yesterday, what little air makes it through Kaufman's head is barely being processed by his lungs. The result of this collaborative suffocation is that he is perpetually one stilted inhalation away from blacking out. If he were to be startled, for example, by his car threatening to stall as it climbs the unholy gradient of the very road where he saw someone die last October, he would pass out and his car would careen off the side of the mountain like stock footage from the Seventies or veer into oncoming traffic and suffer the laws of physics. As he told friends yesterday, Kaufman's car threatened to do precisely that numerous times during the commute home yesterday, meaning that the odds of him dying on the road were already better before his throat and lungs conspired to smother him. Keeping in mind that the root cause of his inability to cancel class is the eruption of an Icelandic volcano that brought Europe to its knees, the likelihood that Kaufman will meet an absurd end tomorrow is quite high. Factor in that once he was nearly arrested while retrieving cat litter from the trunk of his own car and that his trunk currently contains a giant box of the same which he is too winded to ferry into the apartment and it almost seems like the man is asking for it. But what is &quot;it&quot;? How will &quot;it&quot; go down? This is where you come in. Welcome to the First and Last Annual &quot;How Will Kaufman Bite It?&quot; Contest. From now until the inevitable moment of his death tomorrow, we here at Acephalous Identity Incorporated will be taking bets as to how (and with what ferocity) Kaufman bites it. The commenter who best captures the delicious irony of how the universe finally ends SEK will win cash money and needy cats. So what are you waiting for? Comment boxes are standing by.</span></a></div>
