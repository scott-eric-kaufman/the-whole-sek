considers the complex situation and draws some characteristically inane

<p>
To claim the blog exacerabated whatever departmental divisions already existed reminds this
blogger of the days after Timothy McVeigh took down the Alfred P.
Murrah building.&nbsp; Cries of &quot;Islamic fundamentalists!&quot; tore through the
media.&nbsp; This repetition comforted all those who needed explanation. 
When proved patently false, those who had declared that fundamentalists had

<p>
But maybe it was the blog.&nbsp; Perhaps departmental politics <em>do</em> boil down
to some anti-blogger bone.&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; Of course I could be wrong.&nbsp; 
The University of Chicago could publish a statement&nbsp; explaining the Drezner denial declaring that they really wanted to award him tenure but were
threatened by the very thought of his blog.&nbsp; Then I would have to step to
the plate and acknowledge that despite all the tangible benefits my
blog has brought me—the transatlantic emails from scholars I never would have thought interested in my project and the feedback from interested
but not formal academic parties—the
dissertation improvements don't outweigh the mere fact of
blogging.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Grant all that.&nbsp; What matters is the opinion of your material held by the people
you have sell it to.&nbsp; Drezner may have—I'm not qualified to judge—produced
material of the highest caliber at an institution which did not value
it.&nbsp; Or he rubbed someone the wrong way at a faculty party three years
previously.</p>

<p>We could think through this.&nbsp; Or we could jump to conclusions.&nbsp; Sans evidence.&nbsp; Sans testimony.&nbsp; But with a full plate of prejudice.&nbsp; Feel free to do so.&nbsp; I, for one, decline.</p>

He may be intelligent but, as some of those who comment their consolations acknowledge, the department may be headed in a different direction.  Or perhaps he angered one person on his review board.  Perhaps something he had said at a faculty luncheon three years past had rubbed a reviewer raw and submarined his chances.&quot;</p>

<p>But these are even poorer reasons to deny him tenure than his blog! It hardly speaks better of academe to attribute Drezner&#39;s being denied tenure to stuff such as this. Does it?</p></span>

<p>I see no reason to even speculate about whether more-or-less illegitimate factors, like departmental politics, were a factor.  None of us are qualified to judge whether his work was actually good enough to get him tenure at a top economics university.  Blog exaltation of the form that says that since he&#39;s a popular blogger he must really deserve tenure is just as bad as blog denigration that says that you&#39;d better not blog if you want a job.</p></span>

<p>But anyhow, I&#39;d be interested in knowing what percentage of faculty actually get tenure at U. of C.  At some universities (i.e., Stanford, Yale, Harvard), virtually no junior faculty get tenure.  The idea being that you use your job there as a springboard to get a tenured position somewhere else.  These, of course, are Ivy League whereas U. of C. is not, but the point is that there may be institutional factors at work above and beyond departmental politics.</p></span>

<p>It&#39;s possible to get tenure at the U of C, which doesn&#39;t  operate on the same system as Harvard, Princeton, or Yale; however, it&#39;s also quite difficult.  The departments at the U of C keep close tabs on <i>what</i> the junior faculty write--not just <i>how much</i>--and senior faculty expect their comments to be taken seriously.   All of the departments/schools/committees have recognizable &quot;identities&quot; or &quot;profiles,&quot; as it were.  While I was there, at least two people (one in English) lost their tenure bids partly because they decided to ignore their colleagues; both of them promptly found jobs elsewhere.  And as one professor in the English department discovered, having a book from Cambridge wasn&#39;t enough to make it past his third-year contract renewal! </p></span>

<p>Your comment looks strange now that I&#39;ve shooed the trolls away.  Let this be an indication as to why.  As for the rest, if anyone should have insight into departmental politics at U. of C., it&#39;s you.  I expect a report on my desk by 7 PM sharp.</p>

<p>Rich and Stephen,</p>

<p>Linking to Bruce wasn&#39;t my intent, but when I ran a technorati search, his name popped up.  Misspelling Drezner&#39;s name also wasn&#39;t my intent, but at the very least it provides Bruce something to write about later in the week, when he takes up my challenge.  What challenge?  Why, thank you asking!  This challenge:</p>

<blockquote><i>...what I see is a series of justifications for why you aren&#39;t acting like a pompous little twit.</i>

<p>If I am a &quot;pompous little twit,&quot; you should be able to muster some corroborating evidence. Because you can&#39;t--I have many flaws, but pomposity isn&#39;t one of them--I suppose your audience will have to settle for your patented argument-by-repeated-intimation. To wit:</p>

<p><i>I&#39;d still love to hear anecdotes of UCI English Department history; I&#39;ll bet there are many out there.</i></p>

<p>In the rest of the world, you don&#39;t back up a baseless claim with a supposition that you think your baseless claim&#39;s probably true. I mean, you can, but that doesn&#39;t alter the claim.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;m accustomed to the intellectual dishonesty you bring to everything you write, so I don&#39;t doubt that you can manufacture enough examples of &quot;Scott Eric&#39;s pomposity&quot; to prove that I&#39;m twice the twit nobody (outside of you) currently considers me to be. So you know what I say? <i>Give me Hell! Give me the deflation I so richly deserve!</i> (Just be sure you outdo <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/how_not_to_open.html" rel="nofollow">the number I pulled on myself</a>. It&#39;d be embarrassing if my &quot;pompous&quot; self-deprecation out-withers whatever you invent. One suggestion: quote the same excerpts from my Honors Thesis which I soundly mock and claim I wrote them yesterday. That&#39;ll show me!)</blockquote></p>

<p>I know, why even offer it?  I knew he doesn&#39;t play rational, that&#39;ll he twist words out of sentences, sentences out context, and do whatever it takes, honesty be damned, to justify the decision he&#39;s already made.  But I think it&#39;s a difficult case to prove, one which, if undertaken, will <i>so obviously and evidently</i> be the product of selective citation that I need never worry about someone googling me, finding his site and thinking it in any way, shape or form accurate.  Sure, he can call me incompetent for misspelling Drezner&#39;s name or dangling a modifier, but he can&#39;t say that I&#39;m pompous without ignoring 98% of what I&#39;ve written.  He can steal some quotations from some of my more formally academic writings (the recent and forthcoming engagement with Foucault, for example); but he will have to eliminate all self-effacement, all the asides, and everything which makes the prose distinctively mine.  If he does, that, <i>i.e.</i> attacks prose that doesn&#39;t resemble mine, I&#39;d consider the matter settled (for obvious reasons).  </p></span>

		<span id="comment-10273906-content"><p>Tenure cases are somewhat like rituals of passing or transition; there is a public dimension to them, yet what actually happens is a closely guarded secret. At least one way for an outsider to assess the case is to look at the tenure rate for Political Science at U of C. Then, compare D&#39;s public record with that of someone who got tenure. This may not tell you much. It certainly won&#39;t tell you the logic or let you see or completely grasp the moment of decision, but it could make the matter less mysterious.</p>

<p>On blogging: how did D present blogging? As academic work or as a hobby, pasttime, journalism? I have not yet heard anyone count blogging as serious academic publication and this strikes me as right (although this could change). It&#39;s been hard enough getting academic journals to count, or getting workbooks or workprojects formed as downloadable interactive packages to count (I know someone denied promotion when such a project was not considered &#39;publishing&#39;).</p></span>

I know that this machine assigns you IP addresses in the 71.108.xxx.yy range, and that those addresses are assigned (according to <a href="www.geobytes.com" rel="nofollow">Geobytes</a> to machines in the Lancaster, CA area.  In particular, I know that they are assigned to machines around latitude 34.7348 and longitude 118.1710.  I have cross referenced that latitude/longitude combination through Google Earth (not Google Maps, mind you, which doesn&#39;t show that information, but Google Earth) and by analyzing the IP addresses you&#39;ve been assigned by that machine, some of my friends who work for the DOJ&#39;s <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/index.html" rel="nofollow">CCIPS</a> division have determined that you live very close to Papa Johns Pizza and Taco Bell on E.

Your defense will cost money, and if found guilty--and remember, I&#39;ve been logging your IP addresses for the past month, here and on the Valve, and thus have an abundant evidence of your guilt--you could be slapped with a $1,000 fine <i>per incident</i> of harassment <i>and</i> up to one year in jail.  (Keep in mind, you&#39;ve not only threatened my life, but my wife&#39;s as well.)

<p>2.  Of can you grow up, stop leaving violently abusive and threatening comments here <i>and</i> on the Valve, and nothing will happen.  Continue, and after I&#39;ve alerted Verizon I will report this information to the proper authorities.  The ball is in your court.</blockquote></p></span>

I don&#39;t plan on publishing your private information if this continues; I plan on taking it to the DA&#39;s office.  (Look around the LJ department website and then ask yourself &quot;Would a guy who works with a former <i>LA Times</i> beat reporter and for an investigative journalist with ties to the state and federal judiciary have the wherewithal to 1) discover my identity and 2) bring to bear the full force of the law upon me?&quot;)  And for the record: Yes, you have threatened me and my wife:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Hey Yid do your bitch yid clown-schtick while schicksa cooks the matzo balls.

<p>&quot;We know where you are. Your &#39;career&#39; is about to end.&quot;</blockquote></p>

<p>&quot;heh heh&quot;</blockquote></p>

<p>I have the IP addresses both those came from, <i>and</i> they&#39;re yours, <i>and</i> they fall <i>well</i> within the bounds California State Cyberstalking law.  For all I know you could be criminally insane (actually, I know you&#39;re not--yes, I&#39;ve checked--but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t snap).  So criticize to your heart&#39;s content: call me a fraud, cheap, lying or (<i>snickering</i>) a Marxist all you&#39;d like, but threaten me again, and you&#39;ll find yourself ass-deep in lawyer&#39;s fees <i>for years</i>.  (And before you ask, no, I won&#39;t: I have friends in the appropriate places.)</p></span>

Anyone Important Enough To</strong> [Warning: This post may seem livejournalistic. But entertainingly so. You know me better than to think my tales of life at UCI merely personal. They all resonate. Resonate, I say, RESONATE! That, and there's some implicit lessons to be learned on the importance of bibliophile etiquette buried deep beneath the surface of this entry.] Before I begin working through Foucault to the New Historicists, I have some trivia to share. The copy of Hardt and Negri's Empire from which I'll be quoting has an interesting history. It begins in 2000, the year of its initial publication, when Jim Ziegler (since tenure-tracked somewhere) and I were discussing it in the &quot;TA lounge,&quot; a.k.a. the round table in front of the graduate student mailboxes ... which the faculty use as a short-cut between the main English department office and the primary graduate seminar room. (And why shouldn't they? It's their department.) So Jim and I are idly chatting about Empire when Julia Lupton walks up, pauses, greets us, says something to Jim (I'm deaf, remember?) and then hurries off. (Julia's an important person around UCI—a model academic whose standards I fail daily to live up to—she's always hurrying somewhere, and with good reason.) Point being: Julia and Jim exchange words both assumed I could hear. I couldn't, but as I often do in such situations, I nodded my head and pretended to hear all. So when Jim's email arrived later that afternoon asking me what times worked best for me, I had no clue what he was talking about. I related my schedule. &quot;Perfect,&quot; he responded. &quot;I'll get right on it.&quot; &quot;Get right on it?&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;Get right on what?&quot; Turns out everyone rightly pegged Jim as (but mistook me for) the resident Hardt &amp; Negri expert, and that I was now the co-coordinator of the faculty-dominated Empire reading group. You heard me correctly: a first year, in his second quarter, was assumed expert enough in the Hardt &amp; Negri corpus to lead a faculty-dominated reading group. (In retrospect I realize the faith Julia placed in Jim was well-founded, and her willingness to defer to a graduate student on the topic a sign that she practiced the egalitarianism she preached. But I digress.) So I participated in this reading group with Jim, Julia and a host of imposing faculty members like Mark Poster and Andrzej Warminski. One of the highlights of my first year, I tell you. Time passes. The year is 2005. It is Spring Quarter. I haven't thought about Empire or been all that theoretically inclined for years. I still own the book, mind you, and it still overbrims with my original marginalia. I'm invested in every page. Manic glossing. Attack this point here, cheer-lead that point there. The phone rings. &quot;Hello?&quot; I say, assuming the voice at the other end belongs to a machine which desires nothing more than to clean my carpet, lower my mortgage rates or help me refinance my loans. &quot;Yes, I'm told...</span></a></div>

I Wish; or, Cacoethes Scribendi, Indeed! </strong> [If you would like to read some inaugural remarks on Joan Didion's The Year of Magical Thinking, skip the first two paragraphs in which I explain why they're only inaugural. You may also wish to read John Leonard's review of it in The New York Review of Books.] My followup to this post on Foucault's still in the works. In it I'll tie up a few of the criticisms commenters at Long Sunday level, but it proceeds slowly—more slowly even than this damn chapter—and I am a very tired boy. Also in the works: a sustained account of Joan Didion's The Year of Magical Thinking. So far I've bleated and pointed in the opposite direction. Now I'll talk it head on. Not now now, mind you, because sustained analysis isn't possible when you're as tired as I am. How tired am I? Polite of you to ask: Of the past seventy-two hours a grand total of four of them have been spent asleep. Why? That's the funny thing about it: I thought I didn't know why, and it only occurs to me now that I do know why, only I've been so tired I couldn't remember. Since the Big Scary Monster of last year I've been on thyroid hormone replacement therapy, i.e. small doses of levothyroxine every morning. Whenever they change my dosage, I have insomnia. Last Friday they upped my dosage but somehow this slipped my mind. So instead calmly understanding that I wouldn't be able to fall asleep as easily as I typically do, I had one of those insomnia-induced panic attacks, complete with tossing, turning, the choking-back-tears-of-frustration, &amp;c. So tired was I on Saturday that I even though I took my levothyroxine that morning, it still didn't occur to me as I stared sleeplessly at the ceiling Saturday night that my insomnia had a specific and familiar somatic origin. It didn't occur to me until this afternoon. As in Tuesday &quot;after two more sleepless nights&quot; afternoon. So today a couple of scattered thoughts—call it &quot;lucid dreaming&quot; posting—which I'll collect with some presently even more scattered later in the week. The first concerns Didion's implicit contention that John Dunne's &quot;sudden&quot; death could have been prepared for had she seen the signs. Two nights before his death, for example, Didion recalls John asked me if I was aware how many characters died in the novel he had just sent to press, Nothing Lost. He had been sitting in his office making a list of them .... Some months after he died I picked up a legal pad on his desk to make a note. On the legal pad, in very faint pencil, his handwriting, was the list. Why was the pencil so faint, I wondered. Why would he use a pencil that barely left a mark. When did he begin seeing himself as dead? She catalogs all the behaviors which would have had symbolic meaning had she the perspicacity to notice them at the time. As the book progresses,...</span></a></div>
