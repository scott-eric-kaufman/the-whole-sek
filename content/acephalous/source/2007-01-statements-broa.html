The &quot;many&quot; employed in this passage obscures the fact that many, many more domestic novels don't open at physical thresholds. It also conceals the reason why many domestic novels would do so: they're domestic.

Why not focus on how often tables or children appear instead? Notice, too, the implication that the physical location where a novel begins is significant.

<p>As I said, I have every reason to be annoyed with myself.&nbsp; (After those bullets, you do too.)&nbsp; But that's not why I'm annoyed right now.&nbsp; No, right now I'm annoyed by the way in which my annoyance radiates, how it establishes a Zone of Irritation from which nothing can escape.&nbsp; Beards, they can not escape it.&nbsp; Lettuce, it wilts.&nbsp; Other people's work?&nbsp; You must be kidding me.&nbsp; Take this claim, from an otherwise <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674017595/diesekoschmar-20">impressive book</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Many domestic novels open at physical thresholds—such as windows or doorways—to problematize the the relation between interiors and exteriors. (43)</p></blockquote><p>How many?&nbsp; The author discusses three, but looking through my shelf of roughly contemporary novels, I can find no others.&nbsp; Not a one.&nbsp; The nature of the claim-structure is backwards here: I believe X, and &quot;many&quot; cherry-picked novels begin by thematizing it.&nbsp; This is the academic variation of the classic <em>Sportscenter </em>statistic: &quot;On the second and third Wednesdays in March, Bobby Knight-coached teams have only lost to unranked opponents twice in the five years he's coached at Texas Tech.&quot;&nbsp; Only it's worse.&nbsp; The <em>Sportscenter </em>infographic remains faithful to its&nbsp; obscenely specific <em>raison d'être</em>, whereas the academic cousin hides its Wednesdays-in-Marchness behind a facade of general truth.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The &quot;many&quot; employed in this passage obscures the fact that many, <em>many </em>more domestic novels don't open at physical thresholds.&nbsp; It also conceals the reason why many domestic novels would do so: they're <em>domestic</em>.&nbsp; We should expect thresholds and windows to appear frequently for the same reason we expect spaceships to make regular appearances in space operas.&nbsp; Why even make the claim?&nbsp; Why not focus on how often tables or children appear instead?</p>

<p>Notice, too, the implication that the physical location where a novel begins is significant.&nbsp; Should the critic not <em>establish </em>that where a novel opens is more important than, say, where it closes?&nbsp; How could anyone even write this sentence?&nbsp; Isn't the dishonesty of the claim evident to <em>anyone </em>involved in <em>any </em>stage of the writing process?&nbsp; What about all those people thanked on the acknowledgments page, did not a single one of them notice these grievous overstatements?&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; I want to know.&nbsp; I <em>need </em>to know.</p>

<p>This is what life is like inside the Zone of Irritation.&nbsp; Everything is judged by the same unforgiving standards we apply to ourselves, and no one looks—or feels, for that matter—the better for it.&nbsp; </p>

		<span id="comment-28319708-content"><p>How Scott Should Write His Dissertation</p>

<p>1.  Write a chapter as if it&#39;s one big blog post.  If psychologically necessary,  write within the same software used for blogging.  If a chapter is too long to hold the mental state of blog-writing, write each piece of the chapter as a blog post.</p>

<p>2.  Put pieces of the chapter together into Word, and imagine that an inexperienced student has turned this in as an academic paper.  Red-pen/edit the thing into academese.</p>

<p>In this way, it should be able to be done within writing styles with proven productivity already, rather than the new and uncertain dissertation one.  After one or two chapters done this way, you should be able to merge everything into a new style and skip the intervening steps.</p>

<p>If you do try this, the next chapter is the obvious candidate, since you&#39;re probably nearly done with this one and want no excuse to re-write the whole thing.  If you actually try this and it doesn&#39;t work, setting you back horribly, well, you should have known better to take advice from some guy on the Internet.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-28324981-content"><p>I hate to say it, but worrying about style in a dissertation seems like wasted effort.  On the job market, you&#39;ll need one, at most two, 20-page writing samples, and it&#39;s probably best if one of those is a self-contained, article version of a diss chapter (or run-off of a published article).  Other than that, almost no one will ever read your dissertation.  </p>

<p>I received two different, but equally useful, pieces of advice about writing my diss:</p>

<p>1) write three long chapters and don&#39;t worry about anything -- just get it done, get the argument out there, and worry about style and form in the book manuscript and articles (if you decide to pursue that professional route)</p>

<p>2) write seven 25-page chapters in article form so that you can immediately send them off to journals and have writing samples at hand</p>

<p>The second is good advice, but it basically means writing a book manuscipt, not a dissertation.  Book manuscripts take most scholars eight to ten years to write.  Dissertations cannot take that long.  They are disposable forms.  You write one dissertation in a lifetime; you&#39;ll never work in this form again.  There&#39;s not much point perfecting the form.  Of course, you want to impress your dissertation committee, and you want to feel good about yourself.  Still, I&#39;d say, treat the diss more as a means to an end and less as an end in itself.</p>

<p>(Just don&#39;t follow the Walter Benjamin route and write something declared &quot;unreadable&quot; by your committee.)</p></span>

		<span id="comment-28343716-content"><p>The point of the dissertation is to finish it.  Plow ahead until the snowplow gets stuck, dig it out, and keep going until you&#39;ve finished the route.  If you have time, replow the parts that got snowed in since you last plowed them.  Save soul-searching revision agonizing for the time when you turn chapters into into articles and the diss into a book. </p>

<p>Sounds to me like it&#39;s time to put this chapter&#39;s revision aside (at the close of this weekend, if you must keep going a little while longer) and come back to it when you&#39;ve got the rest of the diss done.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-28358387-content"><p>I realize this post is more methodological than substantive, but if you want to see a really creepy and excellent animation about domesticity that does start at a threshold -- the gateway to the front yard -- check out Winsor McCay&#39;s 1921 &quot;The Pet,&quot; which runs for about 11 minutes. The whole thing is framed as a dream. We see a couple in bed at the beginning, talking about dreams, and we return to them at the very end.  But the bulk of the film is the dream itself, the husband&#39;s dream about his wife and her pet. The wife picks up a dog-like pet just after it has walked through the front gate. She brings it into the house, feeds it, and it just grows and grows and grows until, at the end, it’s walking through the city, towering over buildings, eating smaller ones at a single gulp, and so forth, until it is finally destroyed by bombs.  That ends the dream; we then get a few closing seconds with the couple in bed and that’s it. There&#39;s a scene in the middle that&#39;s as creepy as anything I&#39;ve seen in movies and the whole thing is very well drawn and animated. </p></span>
