Sims says of Charles Perrow's Normal Accidents: Much in this book irritates. The sociological theory adds nothing to the argument. The style is infuriating; the long, opening example is tedious and frivolous. There are many assertions which are not technically sustained, particularly the analysis of marine accidents, which is naïve and alarmist. Perrow is too reluctant to use quantitative arguments; there is an implied assumption that dread or hopeless means an infinite disbenefit. Sims' conclusion? This book is important. The principles are sound....With its publication, the science of risk assessment ceases to belong to the shamans. If you're wondering how he got from the first quotation to the second--from reading an irritating, tedious, frivolous, naïve, alarmist book that does its readers infinite disbenefit to an important and sound study whose publication steals the science of risk assessment back from the shamans (who probably didn't much want it anyhow)--be prepared to keep wondering, because those are the final two paragraphs (sans some minor technical detail) of Sims' review. Not that any of this germane to what I want to discuss, which is the thesis of Perrow's Normal Accidents, not its incomprehensible reception. Because I'm not the most adept summarizer in the world--what with my innate and inane tendency to mock anything so uncomplicated even I can understand it--I'll let Bill Williams handle it: Perrow offers the following hypothesis: in technological systems the propensity to accident is built in: the more complex the system the higher the probability--the more tightly coupled the higher the probability. Complex systems are those with many pathways and links between the parts, the full extent of which we often do not understand. Tightly coupled systems are those where consquence follows cause rapidly and inexorably, with little time or opportunity for corrective action...the less complex the system, the less likely to occur are the complicated consequences which may be serious, unforeseen or difficult to diagnose. The less tightly coupled, the more opportunity there is to think, and to try possible corrections. But the obverse is also true: the more tightly coupled, the less opportunity there is to think and try possible corrections. And, as you probably already surmised, systems have been becoming increasingly tightly coupled for a couple of decades now. I ran across the Perrow first in William Langewiesche's article on the downing of ValuJet Flight 592, then again in Jerome Groopman's article on the increasing popularity of patient simulators in medical schools. There's one part of Perrow's thesis I've neglected to mention: the more tightly coupled a system, the less culpable any one actor in that system is when something horrible happens. Any accident not caused by gross incompetence must be considered &quot;normal&quot; because no amount of precaution could have prevented it from happening. I'll let Langewische explain: The failure of one part--whether material, psychological, or organizational--may coincide with the failure of an entirely...</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/ill_bei_iami_a_.html"><span><strong>Implied Associations, Not So Implicit Results, or You Might Be An Unconscious Redneck If...</strong> Bitch Ph.D.--and before you say it, that's her name...there's no proof I'm a misogynist yet--sent readers scuttling over to Harvard's Implicit Association Test. I spent several uncoordinated minutes staring at X after X after X after X only to learn that my incompetence suggested a slight automatic preference for White relative to Black. The next test I took suggested a strong automatic preference for African American relative to White American. The only conclusion I can draw is that I have a slight disinclination to converse with a Black person until I'm 100% certain he or she is an American, at which point the bonds of national identity shove aside whatever minute, unconscious reservations I had had. Which means I'm not a racist... ...I'm a xenophobe. All things considered, is there a better -ist to be in Southern California?</span></a></div>
