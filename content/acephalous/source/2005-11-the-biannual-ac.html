He'd love nothing more to employ you so that he doesn't have to fret over the new students and instructors every year. He feels more comfortable with you teaching and advising the new teachers . . . so comfortable, in fact, that he can focus without guilt on his upper division classes because he knows you have the lower division classes covered. But here's the thing: Normative time to finishing a dissertation is six years. If I'm still here in the Fall of 2006, that'll be my seventh year in the program. Normally, I'm not the type to complain. After all, I spent the Fall, Winter and Spring quarters of last year as a T.A. for 1) my advisor (Fall), 2) the chair of the Literary Journalism department (Winter) and 3) my own section Intro. to Literary Journalism (Spring) . . . all the while spending my &quot;days off&quot; at the hospital undergoing chemotherapy.

I should have taken a leave of absence. Do you know how much work you can accomplish when on the days you don't teach you're dosed with an ever-changing array of chemicals which kill cancer cells but also convince your immune system to summer in Tahiti?

So you've exhausted your funding.&nbsp; After the Spring quarter of this year, despite the fact that you're a dedicated teacher who <em>wants </em>to teach, you will find yourself without a position in the institution you've dedicated the past 5 years of your life to.&nbsp; More to the point, you'll find yourself unable to continue refining <a href="http://www.humanities.uci.edu/litjourn/">the program</a> you've invested the past two years of your life in.&nbsp; Not that the program's chair doesn't want you to.&nbsp; He'd love nothing more to employ you so that he doesn't have to fret over the new students and instructors every year.&nbsp; He feels more comfortable with you teaching and advising the new teachers . . . so comfortable, in fact, that he can focus without guilt on his upper division classes because he knows you have the lower division classes covered.&nbsp; But here's the thing:</p>

<p>Normative time to finishing a dissertation is six years.&nbsp; If I'm still here in the Fall of 2006, that'll be my seventh year in the program.&nbsp; Normally, I'm not the type to complain.&nbsp; After all, I spent the Fall, Winter and Spring quarters of last year as a T.A. for 1) my advisor (Fall), 2) the chair of the Literary Journalism department (Winter) and 3) my own section Intro. to Literary Journalism (Spring) . . . all the while spending my &quot;days off&quot; at the hospital undergoing chemotherapy.&nbsp; See what I mean?&nbsp; I toughed it out.&nbsp; I didn't tell anyone a damn thing or take a leave of absence . . . and now I realize I should have.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I should have told everyone every damn thing.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I should have taken a leave of absence.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Do you know how much work you can accomplish when on the days you don't teach you're dosed with an ever-changing array of chemicals which kill cancer cells but also convince your immune system to summer in Tahiti?&nbsp; </p>

<p>None.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Maybe not &quot;none,&quot; but certainly &quot;less than expected.&quot;&nbsp; In retrospect, as my advisor (who has been nothing short of gracious about the entire affair) informed me, I should've taken a leave of absence.&nbsp; I should've extended the time in which I work on my dissertation while teaching another year.&nbsp; Now I face the prospect of a year without teaching . . . a year in which I'll do nothing but research and live off the wife's slim salary.&nbsp; (Money's not an object.&nbsp; To call me &quot;frugal&quot; would be an understatement.&nbsp; I'm a Jew, er, &quot;Jew.&quot;&nbsp; We have savings.)&nbsp; What I fear isn't the lack of income but the lack of intellectual stimulation.&nbsp; I fear that if I'm not forced to bandy my ideas in something resembling a public sphere that they'll cement themselves in their current, untested forms.&nbsp; So here's the radical proposition I'm considering:</p>

<p>I have a number of regular readers whose intelligence I respect immensely.&nbsp; A few of you have already stepped to the plate and offered to read my dissertation—and for that I am most grateful—but I want to open this up to all interested parties.&nbsp; Come December 1st, I'll have three chapters completed.&nbsp; I would be forever in your debt if you'd read and criticize them.&nbsp; I need outside impetus to finish this thing, to not wallow in the fallows of my compromised immune system—Two <em>different </em>colds and bronchitis in a two week span?—and get my work done.&nbsp; I'd love your feedback, but I can't do much more than ask.&nbsp; </p>

<p>That said, as soon as I cough this shit out of my lungs I'll be my normal acerbic self again.&nbsp; Have no worries.&nbsp; As soon as I stop coughing I'll amuse you again.&nbsp; I promise.&nbsp; </p>

<p>BTW: Can&#39;t you get any adjunct teaching around your area?  I&#39;m like you: I need to teach in order to think and write.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m stupidly teaching as part of my fellowship, adjuncting at a local university, going on the job market, applying for jobs at private high schools, and trying to finish my Morrison chapter.  Fun fun.</p></span>

<p>I want to second Stephens advice as well. It wasn&#39;t that long ago that I read an article at the Chronicle of Higher Education about a new professor that emailed her dissertation to a grad student (supposedly for the student&#39;s research), and the grad student PLAGAIRIZED THE ENTIRE THING for his own dissertation. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say that there are a lot of intellectually dishonest people of all stripes out there. </p></span>

The rituals of father and son relations dictate an insurmountable formality which compels them to seek other avenues of understanding. For most of the 20th Century, those other avenues terminated in weekly sessions with other sons' fathers (and infrequently mothers) who would tell them about Oedipus' father (and unfortunate mother) and ask for payment in cash. For reasons which have more to do with the culture of analysis captured by Woody Allen than anything else, I associate this obsession with Freudian psychotherapy and unkempt beards with the 1970s. All of which I offer as introduction to the idea that Noah Baumbach, writer of the recently released The Squid and the Whale (2005) and the brilliant Kicking &amp; Screaming (1995), learned about his father through the fiction of his father, the novelist and short story writer Jonathan Baumbach. Why do I find this interesting? If Jonathan Baumbach's fiction is staunchly personal but ultimately fictional, then Noah Baumbach's depictions of the fathers of his characters don't refer to his father so much as the narrators of his father's fictions. In other words, the narrator of Jonathan's The Life &amp; Times of Major Fiction appears as the father in all of Noah's films. I originally thought I would land somewhere in the vicinity of &quot;Jonathan's narrators are autobiographical in an uncomplex fashion,&quot; at which point I could dismiss the artistry of Jonathan's novels and claim that Noah's depiction of Jonathan (played by '70s icon Elliot Gould) nailed him. But as I re-read The Life &amp; Times today I realized that argument would be facile in the extreme. Jonathan's obsessions can be catalogued with ease: pointless games imbued with meaning, the awkwardness of lives acrumbling, the divorces of the preternaturally witty and their relation to the kids' unconscious, and basketball. This particular constellation of interests appears both in the narratives of Jonathan's The Life &amp; Times and B. and Noah's Kicking &amp; Screaming. (And what, I ask, would Freud make of this family's obsession with ampersands?) In Noah's film, the viewer witnesses Gould attempt to connect with his estranged son through talk of the Knicks' failures and Patrick Ewing's failings. Grover, Noah's surrogate, belongs to a circle who fall out via an argument about the protocols of an improvised bar-room trivia game. Having read Jonathan's work, viewers of Noah's films cannot help but see a world limited by his father's obsessions—a Bloomian anxiety in extremis. Lest you think I desire diminishing the brilliance of my favorite film of the 1990s, I will add that I think this appropriation, intentional or not, an incredible glance into the relation of authors to their lives. That Noah crafts a fictional father who resembles his father's fictions more than his father fascinates me. Take Jonathan's short story &quot;Familiar Games.&quot; It contains a pointless contest irrationally imbued with significance, intimations of lives teetering on the flimsiest of fulcrums, portentions of...</span></a></div>
