        <meta name="description" content="(Being the first in a series of reposts being reposted solely because Googlers likes them. After &quot;My Morning,&quot; this is the second most popular post on Acephalous. Because Googlers want nothing more than to see some &quot;comic book rape,&quot; &quot;rogue rape,&quot; and, most distressingly, &quot;comic rape.&quot; Because when you get right down to it, is anything inherently funnier than rape?) This post isn't a direct response to &quot;Comic Book Guys Are Stupid,&quot; but it is a response of some kind. Let me walk you through this one: The year is 1988. I'm a recent transplant to Louisiana and am thus a tad on the introverted side. I spend endless hours reading comic books. I may have liked some girls at this point, but I see no evidence of it in my fourth grade yearbook. (My fifth grade yearbook is an entirely different, hearts-encircling-pictures story.) Point being, I distinctly remember not thinking about nor even knowing what rape was. But I mow my lawn every day—my father having decided to instill the value of hard work by allowing me to earn $4 whenever I want by re-re-re-mowing what my work ethic transformed into a mangy lawn—and so have plenty of money to blow on X-books. So I'm spending my afternoons blissfully unaware of anything which doesn't involve the X-Men or X-Factor or The New Mutants or, if I was desperate enough, Alpha Flight. One late October afternoon I'm holding in my hands X-Men #236. On the cover Wolverine and Rogue are hung by their on a scaffold, flanked on both sides by grinning fools in military garb. (This picture disturbs me more now than it did then.) What happened? The X-Men sacrificed themselves to save the world, only in the end they were granted a reprieve: they would be dead to the world but would live undetected and undetectable in the Australian outback. They were invisible to all forms of electronic recording devices. They were able to move throughout the world invisible to all by the naked eye. (You want to privilege presence? I'll privilege you some presence.) Then a fascist state called &quot;Genosha&quot; clashes with the X-Men. Shit hits fans. Wolverine and Rogue are captured. For those unfamiliar with the comics or the films, Rogue has the power to absorb the memories and/or mutant powers of whomever she touches. So naturally, she doesn't touch anyone for fear of knocking them unconscious and draining them of their &quot;life energy.&quot; (Stop sniggering. I was in fourth grade.) Her entire life Rogue has wanted nothing more than to touch someone without hurting them. To be loved. But she's come to accept the fact that this will never happen. This self-sacrifice moves the fourth-grade mind. I sympathized with her despite having no clue as to what she sacrificed or why.

<p>This post isn't a direct response to &quot;<a href="http://blog.iblamethepatriarchy.com/2006/06/02/comic-book-guys-are-stupid/">Comic Book Guys Are Stupid</a>,&quot; but it <em>is </em>a response of some kind.&nbsp; Let me walk you through this one:</p>

<div class="entry-body">

<p>The year is 1988.&nbsp; I'm a recent transplant to Louisiana and am thus
a tad on the introverted side.&nbsp; I spend endless hours reading comic
books.&nbsp; I may have liked some girls at this point, but I see
no evidence of it in my fourth grade yearbook.&nbsp; (My fifth grade
yearbook is an entirely different, hearts-encircling-pictures story.) 
Point being, I distinctly remember not thinking about nor even knowing
what rape was.&nbsp; But I mow my lawn every day—my father having decided to
instill the value of hard work by allowing me to earn $4 whenever I
want by re-re-re-mowing what my work ethic transformed into a mangy
lawn—and so have plenty of money to blow on X-books.&nbsp; So I'm spending
my afternoons blissfully unaware of anything which doesn't involve the <em>X-Men</em> or <em>X-Factor</em> or <em>The New Mutants</em> or, if I was desperate enough, <em>Alpha Flight</em>. </p>

<p>One late October afternoon I'm holding in my hands <em>X-Men </em>#236.&nbsp; On <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/01.jpg">the cover</a>
Wolverine and Rogue are hung by their on a scaffold, flanked on both
sides by grinning fools in military garb.&nbsp; (This picture disturbs me
more now than it did then.)&nbsp; What happened?&nbsp; The <em>X-Men </em>sacrificed themselves to save the world, only in the end they were granted a reprieve: they would be dead <em>to the world </em>but
would live undetected and undetectable in the Australian outback.&nbsp; They
were invisible to all forms of electronic recording devices.&nbsp; They were
able to move throughout the world invisible to all by the naked eye. 
(You want to privilege presence?&nbsp; <em>I'll privilege you some presence</em>.)&nbsp; Then a fascist state called &quot;Genosha&quot; clashes with the X-Men.&nbsp; Shit hits fans.&nbsp; Wolverine and Rogue are captured.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with the comics or the films, Rogue has the
power to absorb the memories and/or mutant powers of whomever she
touches.&nbsp; So naturally, she doesn't touch anyone for fear of knocking
them unconscious and draining them of their &quot;life energy.&quot;&nbsp; (Stop
sniggering.&nbsp; <em> I was in fourth grade.</em>)&nbsp; Her entire life Rogue
has wanted nothing more than to touch someone without hurting them.&nbsp; To
be loved.&nbsp; But she's come to accept the fact that this will never
happen.&nbsp; This self-sacrifice moves the fourth-grade mind.&nbsp; I
sympathized with her despite having no clue as to what she sacrificed
or why.&nbsp; I only know that it pained her and, being the good sympathetic
identifier, felt her pain by proxy.&nbsp; So without really knowing why I
want Rogue to able to touch people.&nbsp; </p>

<p>After she's captured by the Genoshans, she's stripped of her mutant
powers.&nbsp; Now she can touch people without having to worry about killing
them.&nbsp; For a moment I'm happy for her.&nbsp; If only she can get out of this
jam she'll be able to touch someone!&nbsp; That's all she ever wanted!&nbsp; Then
I hit this panel:</p>

<center><img src="http://acephalous.typepad.com/upload13.jpg" /></center><p>And
I'm confused.&nbsp; That's Rogue huddled there in the corner.&nbsp; She's
traumatized.&nbsp; Over the next few issues she'll disappear.&nbsp; Another
personality—and I mean that literally—will emerge.&nbsp; Rogue will be so
hurt by whatever &quot;liberties [were] taken when she was being processed&quot;
that she'll cede control of her psyche to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Danvers">Carol Danvers</a>. 
(Read the link.&nbsp; It's too complicated to explain briefly.)&nbsp; Needless to
say, despite not knowing quite what those &quot;liberties&quot; were, countless
data points began to constellate for me.&nbsp; I saw &quot;touching&quot; and &quot;forced&quot;
and &quot;fascism&quot; and &quot;liberties&quot; circle the pained figure in the panel
above and I was confused.&nbsp; Angry.&nbsp; Upset.&nbsp; I didn't know why, but I
was.&nbsp; My sympathies had identified with something they couldn't
comprehend.&nbsp; </p>

<p>When I was hit by that car and the pain plus the medication turned
my mind to cottage cheese and the most &quot;intellectual&quot; material I could
stomach were comics—<em>i.e. </em>last week until today—I stumbled into
a realization: my feminist sympathies were first marshaled while
reading a comic back in the Autumn of '88.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The medium is far from perfect—as noted in the comments to the post
linked above—but it is not wholly without value.&nbsp; I'm not defending
myself here so much as describing a stage in my development.&nbsp; So please
don't read this and think &quot;Scott think spandex is <em>progressive</em>?&quot;&nbsp; I don't.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Only once upon a time, perhaps, it inadvertently was.</p>

You can actually look at this the other way around: they turned rape into a cheap narrative ploy.  That&#39;s as possible as the alternative I presented above.  But perhaps the point&#39;s that people always come into sympathy obliquely, in the odd human moments when narratives cease making sense.  </p>

<p>Or maybe it&#39;s the fact that I&#39;m reading, quite conflictedly, Alison Bechdel&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0618871713/diesekoschmar-20" rel="nofollow"><em>Fun Home</em></a>.  It&#39;s too pat, the flat version of the incidental-but-importantly-so books it cites, <em>Recherche du temps perdu</em> foremost among them.  I may be wandering in a modernist mist and untypically uncharitable of comics as a genre tonight ... which makes my reposting of this passive-aggressive.  </p></span>

I find the result profoundly humiliating to me. For it obliges me to renounce my allegiance to the Darwinian theory of the Ascent of Man from the Lower Animals; since it now seems plain to me that that theory ought to be vacated in favor of a new and truer one, this new and truer one to be named the Descent of Man from the Higher Animals. [...] Some of my experiments were quite curious. In the course of my reading I had come across a case where, many years ago, some hunters on our Great Plains organized a buffalo hunt for the entertainment of an English earl—that, an to provide some fresh meat for his larder. They had charming sport. They killed seventy-two of those great animals; and ate part of one of them and left the seventy-one to rot. In order to determine the difference between an anaconda and an earl—if any—I caused seven young calves to be turned into the anaconda's cage [of the London Zoological Garden]. The grateful reptile immediately crushed one of them and swallowed it, then lay back satisfied. It showed no further interest in the calves, and no disposition to harm them. I tried this experiment with other anacondas; always with the same result. The fact stood proven that the difference between an earl and an anaconda is, that the earl is cruel and the anaconda isn't; and that the earl wantonly destroys what he has no use for, but the anaconda doesn't. This seemed to suggest that the earl was descended from the anaconda, and had lost a good deal in the transition. I was aware that many men who have accumulated more millions of money than they can ever use, have shown a rabid hunger for more, and have not scrupled to cheat the ignorant and the helpless out of their poor savings in order to partially appease that appetite. I furnished a hundred different kinds of wild and tame animals the opportunity to accumulate vast stores of food, but none of them would do it. The squirrels and bees and certain birds made accumulations, but stopped when they had gathered a winter's supply, and could not be persuaded to add to it either honestly or by chicane. In order to bolster up a tottering reputation the ant pretended to store up supplies, but I was not deceived. I know the ant. These experiments convinced me that there is a difference between man and the Higher Animals: he is avaricious and miserly, they are not. [...] Among my experiments was this. In an hour I taught a cat and a dog to be friends. I put them in a cage. In another hour I taught them to be friends with a rabbit. In the course of two days I was able to add a fox, a goose,...</span></a></div>

The portrait's both compelling handsome and profoundly unsettling. The scars to the cheeks remark equally of STD and the fell deaths of organized criminals. Simply put, my dreams are haunted now not by words, but by him, with his face. (I do have an item half-written about the literate dreaming of words, and will post it as soon as I've thought it through more.)</span></a></div>
