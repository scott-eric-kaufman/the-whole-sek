<p>This is not Bob Barr's Bob Heinlein. Granted, it's a damned clever
interpretation, but I'm more inclined to agree with my colleague <a href="http://adamroberts.com/" mce_href="http://adamroberts.com">Adam Roberts</a>, who <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0333970225/diesekoschmar-20" mce_href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0333970225/diesekoschmar-20">claims</a> that after 1960, Heinlein sacrificed the virtues of his early work</p>
<blockquote><p>to a strident, even desperate 'puppet-master' authorial
persona, which harps incessantly and sometimes unpleasantly on a narrow
range of ideological concerns: the importance of individual liberty
conceived in the American libertarian mode, with a pendant mistrust of
'government' and a fetishisation of authority as such.</p></blockquote>
<p>Difficult as it for us, as adults, to read novels in which
characters break the fourth wall to deliver lectures about politics,
the anti-authoritarian appeal of the libertarian rants of Heinlein's
not-even-veiled surrogates shouldn't be overestimated, as the only
alternative explanation for his continued popularity among the
adolescent set is that 70 percent of his work is <em>made of fucking</em>.*</p>

<p>Not just any old fucking, though, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441788386/diesekoschmar-20" mce_href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441788386/diesekoschmar-20"><em>polyamorous-underwater</em>-fucking</a>, a practice whose appeal to the bookish 16-year-old mind can't be exaggerated.&nbsp; There's also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/034530988X/diesekoschmar-20" mce_href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/034530988X/diesekoschmar-20">rape-fucking</a>, which is mildly disturbing until you remember that by novel's end it becomes <em>marriage</em>-fucking, at which point you overdose on disturb and vow never to use your penis again.&nbsp; Especially when compared to the <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/comic_book_rape.html" mce_href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/06/comic_book_rape.html">respectful, nuanced treatment</a> of rape by <em>Chris Claremont</em>.&nbsp; The mind reels.**</p>
<p>My point, as you've probably surmised, is that this day in 1907
saw the birth of an author whose adolescent philosophy was disseminated

<p>I didn&#39;t mean to imply that he was wrong about everything because he was a libertarian <em>or</em> that if you&#39;re a libertarian you&#39;re wrong about everything.  My intent was to mock myself for adopting the extreme form of libertarianism he espoused in his fiction when thinking about the real world.  Idealism doesn&#39;t work so well when it involves, you know, real people.  (Although reading Iain Banks right now ain&#39;t helping anything, as I&#39;m being subjected to a tour of commonplace horrors which, in the Culture culture of the narrative perspective, are utterly unfathomable.</p>

<p><em>Friday is a great mix of utopic and dystopic elements, classic use of SF to carry out sociological and historical projection, which is good because the backstory makes less sense than the sex.</em></p>

<p>Really?  I read <em>Friday</em> on the tail end of my Heinlein phase and found it loathsome.  I couldn&#39;t even enjoy the story because the premises were so misogynistic.  (And this was <em>before</em> I read the feminist texts which would render me humorless forever.)  I don&#39;t even think the novel worked on its own terms, as it meandered towards its resolutiony thingy with the strict gait of a lapsed alcoholic.  </p>

<p>That said, I may&#39;ve overplayed the Heinlein hatred out of self-loathing, as I remember some of the horrible positions I took back in the day and wish I&#39;d had, you know, something resembling life experience to temper their abstraction.</p></span>

<p>In other news: following the link to the amazon.com <i>Friday</i> page makes for some interesting reading of (87, no less) customer comments.  For example, Joss Delage (Seattle, WA USA): &quot;One of my all time favorite...: Heinlein is great, although sometimes a little bit paternalistic vis-a-vis women...&quot;  First ellipsis mine; second his.  Yes, writing a pneumatic, promiscuous supposedly &#39;strong&#39; female character who loves to be raped <i>is</i> a little bit paternalistic vis-a-vis women.  Pff.  Speaking as a pater I do not concur.  Mind you, perhaps Joss Delage&#39;s observation sets out to deconstruct traditional family dynamics by uncovering the systematic deeprooted sexual violence underpinning our patriarchal culture?  As readings of <i>Friday</i> go, <i>that</i> would be one of my all-time favorite.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-121492498-content"><p><i>Friday</i> was also the last-ever Heinlein book I read.  I must have been 14, something like that.  It was a completely gross book (if I may lapse into 14-year-old descriptive terms).  SEK left out the mutilation that was part of the rape-torture scene that the heroine bravely gets over so that she can sleep with the one of the rapists who was nice.  There&#39;s really nothing much you can say about that other than &quot;ick&quot;. And the politics -- well, a remember a paean to British Canadian politeness, and the idea that politeness was the good from which all political goodness flowed, and even to a 14 year old, that just didn&#39;t seem very rock-and-roll.  It was typical libertarianism, which is to say that serious crimes against the powerless didn&#39;t matter in comparison to the &quot;freedom&quot; to have white middle-class people set the societal rules.</p>

<p>That Iain Banks book, now, that&#39;s politics.  My favorite of the list of commonplace horrors was the volunteer doctors.  I had up to that time completely fallen for the idea of doctors charitably serving the poor as a good thing.  Then of course I thought, but would I want to go to a volunteer doctor?  Given that we&#39;re in a society in which expertise is expected to be rewarded with money, what does it mean that poor people are left to volunteers?</p></span>

If I recall, Friday&#39;s boss tells her that the absolute symptom of societal breakdown is not only that people stop being polite to one another, but that <i>they take perverse pleasure in being rude</i>.  That&#39;s when decadence leads to apocalypse.  Punk rock, you see: after 1976 Western Civilisation had a matter of only a few years before everything broke down completely.</p></span>

He may be setting her up as a paragon/fantasy, and a lot of 14-year olds may read it that way at first, but there&#39;s all kinds of emotional and sexual trauma in her background (and present, yes) which she deals with by using an immense amount of self-rationalization and an intense, frustrated search for emotional security. I&#39;ve never read Friday as a serious sexual fantasy: the character is much too troubled. </p></span>

		<span id="comment-121515794-content"><p>Indeed, I also think this Heinlein-hate is excessive.  Consider that the author of <i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i> also wrote <i>Starship Troopers</i> and <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i>.  For the connection between the first and the second, you might claim that libertarians often have a secret authoritarian streak, and indeed they often don&#39;t hide it well, but you have to do a lot more work to fit in the third.  Heinlein let all his characters speak for themselves with great vehemence; their passion shouldn&#39;t necessarily lead us to think that they were also speaking for the author.</p>

<p>Also remember that Heinlein never claimed to want to change the world, the way Rand did; he always said he wrote for the money.  And one thing that has to be said about even his last, most unreadable novels, is that they always sold very well.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-121519570-content"><p>I am unable to write about Heinlein without perhaps excessive dislike, and don&#39;t pretend to.  But remember that part of <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i> was the threat of genocide.  If the new messiah decided that humanity didn&#39;t measure up, he was ready, willing, and able to do something to the Earth&#39;s core to destroy it.  I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s still authoritarian.  People seem to be willing to treat sex fantasies as anti-authoritarian when really they&#39;re perhaps just fantasies of older men getting to fuck all sorts of younger women equally.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad that Scott has taken my advice to read some Iain Banks.  I renew my advice to read Norman Spinrad&#39;s <i>The Iron Dream</i>, too.  It&#39;s nowhere near as good a book, or as pleasant a read.  But I still think that you can&#39;t really understand early-to-mid SF -- including Heinlein -- without reading it.</p></span>

<p>Rich: &quot;<i>remember that part of Stranger in a Strange Land was the threat of genocide.</i>&quot;  It&#39;s more than just the threat: the novel explains that the asteroid belt was once a planet, until the Martians &#39;grokked&#39; wrongness in its inhabitants and blew it to smithereens.

Few are the authors who inspire the flattery of imitation more than he! Few are the critics who are able to resist the urge to flatter any else but he! Few are the sentences in which I'll continue to enact the enthused imitations I mock! Think I'm making this up? The following might be far less successful than zunguzungu's found Williams, but the poemified version of the anonymous review of Leaves of Grass from the September 1855 edition of The United States Review certainly is telling. In a way, this is an extreme version of a common critical vice: read too much of this or that to the exclusion of all else and you'll start to inhabit the voice you purport to study. The linked example may be Derrida, but read a few books on Joyce and Faulkner and you'll see the same unhealthy attitude abounds. But I digress. On to the ersatz American heart of the body poetic! Walt Whitman and His Poems An American bard at last! One of the roughs, large, proud, affectionate, eating, drinking, and breeding, His costume manly and free, His face sunburnt and bearded, His postures strong and erect, His voice bringing hope and prophecy to the generous races of young and old. We shall cease shamming and be what we really are. We shall start an athletic and defiant literature. We realize now how it is and what was most lacking. The interior American republic shall also be declared free and independent. For all our intellectual people, Followed by their books, poems, essays, editorials, lectures, tuitions, and criticisms, Dress by London and Paris modes, receive what is received there, Obey the authorities, Settle disputes by the old tests, Keep out of rain and sun, Retreat to the shelter of houses and schools, Trim their hair, shave, touch not the earth barefoot, And enter not the sea except in a complete bathing dress. One sees unmistakably genteel persons, Traveled, college-learned, used to being served by servants, Conversing without heat or vulgarity, Supported on chairs or walking through handsomely-carpeted parlors, Or along shelves bearing well-bound volumes. Where in American literature is the first show of America? Where are the gristle and beards, and broad breasts, and space and ruggedness and nonchalance that the souls of the people love? Where is the majesty of the federal mother, seated with more than antique grace, calm, just, indulgent to her brood of children, calling them around her, regarding the large and the young and the older with perfect impartiality? Where is the vehement growth of our cities? Where is the spirit of the strong rich life of the American mechanic, farmer, sailor, hunter, and miner? Where is the huge composite of all other nations, cast in a fresher and brawnier matrix, passing adolescence, and needed this day, live and arrogant, to lead the marches of...</span></a></div>

It’s insufferable.*</strong> (X-posted.) On this day in 1930, the only man to ingest every major work ever written and survive, Harold Bloom, was born. His feats of speed and memorization are legend, but even most literary scholars are unaware that not only has he consumed the entire Western Canon, he has written a magisterial tome about each and every item contained therein. In an April interview concerning the three-month lag between the publication of Thomas Pynchon’s Against the Day and his anxious, Gnostic appreciation of it, Bloom confessed he finds it “increasingly difficult to remain abreast of major works of late because so many of them suck balls.” Asked to clarify, Bloom refused to mince words: “When I declared this the best novel in the history of ever, I must have been asleep. It wouldn’t be the first book I’ve composed thus.” When reached for comment, John Crowley was found on the floor weeping uncontrollably. His agent, Richard Cummings, on a stepladder in the hall affixing a noose to the ceiling fan, was also unavailable for comment. *Cf.</span></a></div>
