<p>[Episodes I, II, II/II, III, IV and V have been <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/how_to_open_an_academic_essay/index.html"> catalogued</a> for your convenience.&nbsp; Now I present the promised <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/05/how_to_open_an__1.html">installment</a> on The Balinese Cockfight.]
</p>
<p>
The origins of the cockfight in literary studies are shrouded in
mystery.&nbsp; No mention of the cockfight appears in Stephen
Greenblatt’s formulaic introduction to “The Forms of Power
and the Power of Forms in the Renaissance” (<em>Genre</em> 15: 1-2).&nbsp; (Of that other New Historical tic, the one <em>not</em>
involving dead chickens, i.e. the chiasmus, the same cannot be said.)
The first appearance of the cockfight as “meta-social
commentary” occurs in Houston Baker’s <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0030-8129%28198310%2998%3A5%3C828%3ATMWMAA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-F">“To Move without Moving: An Analaysis of Creativity and Commerce in Ralph Ellison’s Trueblood Episode</a>.”
Baker quotes the following passage from Clifford Geertz’s seminal
“Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight”:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Like any art form--for that, finally, is what we are
dealing with--the cockfight renders ordinary, everyday experience
comprehensible by presenting it in terms of acts and objects which have
been...raised...to the level of sheer appearances, where their meaning
can be more powerfully articulated and more exactly perceived.</p></blockquote>

<p>Why Geertz felt the need to travel to Bali to discover the inherent
meta-social commentary of a cockfight is curious.&nbsp; A famous
American orator and former cockfight referee once said that “as
long as the Almighty permits intelligent men, created in His image and
likeness, to fight in public and kill each other while the world looks
on approvingly, it is not for me to deprive the chicken of the same
privilege.” Ol’ Honest Abe nailed this whole metaphorical
meta-social meta-commentary meta-long before Geertz wrote one word
about cockfights.&nbsp; Since Mr. Lincoln lacks the scholarly
credentials of a Clifford Geertz, Baker quotes
Geertz instead.&nbsp; He doesn’t attempt to out-cockfight-cite the locus
primus of the cockfight-cite.&nbsp; We’re looking for someone who
opens an essay with the cockfight-cite and unsurpisingly, that someone
is Stephen Greenblatt.&nbsp; <em>In 1994</em>.&nbsp; From <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0734-6018%28199423%290%3A48%3C97%3ATEOTS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-8">“The Eating of the Soul&quot;</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>I have seen Balinese cockfights, and I can assure you that
a resemblance to Shakespeare’s work of art is not immediately
apparent.&nbsp; No doubt the losing cock, bleeding in the dirt, feels
the tragedy of the occasion...but the structure and duration of the
cockfight, not to mention the expressive limitations of the cocks
themselves, preclude the dignity and weight of tragedy.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Opening an essay with two colliding anecdotes draws attention to the
structural similarities between, in this case, cockfighting and
Shakespearean tragedy.&nbsp; The effect of Geertz’s original
juxtaposition of cockfighting and <em>Macbeth</em>, according to Greenblatt, is such that 
</p>
<blockquote><p>Balinese cockfighting and the Shakespearean spectacle of
treachery and damnation--apparently so distant from one another in
their symbolic stakes and their cultural position--are made to touch
and resonate.&nbsp; The immediate result for the anthropologist is an
air of dignity conferred upon Balinese cockfighting; that, and a kind
of hermeneutical license linked to this dignity: cockfighting is a
complex, symbolically charged <em>text</em> that can be profitably read by a gifted interpreter.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Greenblatt’s emphasis on the word “text” reveals the
rhetoric for what it is: rhetoric.&nbsp; Reduce the world to
“text” and any “mundane narrative” can be
juxtaposed, for effect, with a “literary narrative”
counterpart.&nbsp; Sonja Laden rightly argues in <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/poetics_today/v025/25.1laden.html">“Recuperating the Archive: Anecdotal Evidence and Questions of ‘Historical Realism’&quot;</a>
that Greenblatt &amp; Co. are “‘poetic’ New
Historicists,” that is, they’ve more in common--minus the
radical Marxist and feminist politics--with the literary journalism of
John McPhee than conventional academic criticism.&nbsp; Opening an
essay with an irrelevent but structurally homologous anecdote thus
transforms the lowly academic critic into an <em>artist</em>.&nbsp;

And by &quot;complete,&quot; I believe they mean all of them. Plain text and scanned images of the bard's breathlessly illegible script. There will also be plain text versions of all the significant secondary material. The current seraphic quality of countenance notwithstanding, I'm so hankering to read Darwin and his significant secondaries the idea of waiting until October--that's months after my summer dissertation grant (not to mention summer) expires--threatens my sanity. I've led the Rabid Rabble before. I can reassemble their ranks for some Rabid Rabble Rampaging. I know the procedure. Thems what knows best for theirs might should consider putting on in July what they might not lives to publish in October.</span></a></div>
	<div class="content-nav-next"><div class="content-nav-label">PREVIOUS POST</div><a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/06/a_very_unfunny_.html"><span><strong>A Very Unfunny Entry About My Intellectual Shortcomings, or The Five Year Rule</strong> So I've spent some time thinking about Derrida this weekend in order to generate an intelligent response to Matt over on Long Sunday, but I must admit to being severely out of my league. What amazes me is how thoroughly I've forgotten everything I ever learned about Derrida and deconstruction. I'm flipping through my copies of Writing and Difference, Glas, The Gift of Death, &amp;c. and staring incomprehensibly at my incomprehensible notes. I'm reading over the essay I wrote for J. Hillis Miller on The Gift of Death--by which I mean I'm dumbly observing the words tumbling over the pages but not understanding them at all--and it dawns on me that I may've conned my way through the first couple of years of graduate school. I sincerely belive that Hillis' comments on this essay are the product of his genius, i.e. utterly unrelated to the reality of the essay he graded. Which is only to say, qua Matt, that the word &quot;deconstruction&quot; ought not only be banned from undergraduate classroom, but graduate seminars too. In other words, what happened to that eager incoming graduate student who, knowing he'd attend Derrida's seminar in the Spring, spent hours reading every book and article the Man had ever written? I remember sitting before the shelves of the Critical Theory Archive with contraband coffee and unbounded enthusiasm, reading with infinite patience primary and secondary materials whose full import I still can't comprehend. I remember neglecting my other classes--including, ironically, the Introduction to Critical Theory course that might've grounded my extra-curricular study--in order to read, say, Derrida's new essay in Critical Inquiry. But it's all gone. All of it. (Cynics among you will think I'm accusing Derrida of writing in a manner that condemns all but his broadest claims to the void. I may very well be. But I don't think it offensive to say that careful, continual study is required to read and remember difficult works.) Perhaps this all falls under the principles codified in The Five Year Rule, according to which Scott declines to speak about books he's read more than five years ago because he can seldom say anything intelligent about them. Countless times have fellow graduate students throppled by a novel they know Scott's read come to him for intelligent conversation only to have Scott stare blankly at them. &quot;Jane Austen? The name rings a bell. A small one. In a church fourteen districts north. Of some place fourteen hundred miles east. Wait! Isn't she the sister in Middlemarch?&quot;</span></a></div>
