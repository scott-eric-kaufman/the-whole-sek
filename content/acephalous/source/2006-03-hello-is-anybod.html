		<span id="comment-15362470-content"><p>Adam, your review is another example of the recent Acephalsou focus on unpleasant truths revealed -- like the idea that a gaffe is defined as an occasion when a politician accidentally tells the truth. Something that starts with &quot;surely we can hope, surely expect, to encounter newness in SF?&quot; can be guaranteed to draw horrified denial from fans.  No one is allowed to question whether every new SF novel is, in fact, <a href="http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/irrational_inso.html#comment-15080838" rel="nofollow">new</a>.</p>

<p>I have to say that the list looks especially tiresome to me.  Is this really the best the UK is producing these days?  *My* small part of the world, i.e. western Massachusetts, produced two interesting fantasies or sort-of-fantasies in 2005 -- fantasies not being under any obligation to be new, they can be &quot;interesting&quot; while still being complete pastiches of existing source material -- John Crowley&#39;s _Lord Byron&#39;s Novel_ and Paul Park&#39;s _A Princess of Roumania_.</p></span>

<p>(spoilers for the early part of the book that you&#39;ve already read)</p>

<p>premise 1 is that our entire world is fictional, and fairly soon it goes up in smoke when the only copies of the book holding it are burned.  By the end of the book (and I don&#39;t think this is quite a spoiler because it&#39;s an interpretation) I think that it becomes apparent that the protagonist has been fictionalized or virtualized in some manner.  It&#39;s bog-standard adolescent girl fantasy filtered through Borges.  As such it&#39;s a bit more postmodern and mannered than I like -- it has all the problems that, say, poetry about poetry has -- but it&#39;s still interesting in a way that I would guess that many of the books that Adam reviewed are not.</p></span>

She's got the patent resume of somebody that has serious skill. She loves football. She's African-American, which would kind of be a big coon. A big coon. Oh my God. I am totally, totally, totally, totally, totally sorry for that. [.wma] The link to the audio on The St. Louis Post-Dispatch warns potential listeners of the clip's &quot;offensive language.&quot; People were certainly offended by it. KTRS station manager Tim Dorsey fired Lenihan a scant twenty minutes after his self-described &quot;slip of the tongue.&quot; According to Dorsey, Lenihan's &quot;slip&quot; was a most unfortunate racial slur. There can be no excuse for what was said. Dave Lenihan has been let go. There is enough hate. We certainly are not going to fan those flames. That is not what we're about. St. Louis' NAACP chapter president, Harold Crumpton, called Dorsey seeking an explanation. Dorsey explained that Lenihan had already been fired. Crumpton sounded pleased, noting that &quot;coon&quot; is a word &quot;intended to inflame passions . . . like the 'n word.'&quot; I emphasize the word &quot;intended&quot; because the intention is there only in a general sense. It fails to account for the specific context of this utterance. His unfortunate &quot;slip&quot; immediately follows a conversation in which Lenihan agrees with a caller who said she'd make a &quot;fantastic President.&quot; He accidentally calls her a &quot;coon&quot; while trying to refer to the &quot;coup&quot; her ascension to NFL Commissioner would be. I grant you that the word &quot;coup&quot; immediately following the phrase &quot;she's African-American&quot; reeks of tokenism. But to claim that he &quot;intended to inflame passions&quot; by praising her qualifications for both the office of President of the United States and the Commissioner of the National Football League irks me. This kind of unintentionally offensive comment differs from those which result from unacknowledged privilege. Lenihan's language isn't &quot;unintended&quot; in the &quot;I'm unaware of the structural inequalities inherent in contemporary America&quot; so much as the &quot;I tripped over my tongue and out came what sounded like a racial epithet&quot; way. (Unless you believe that in praising Rice he intended to denigrate all African-Americans. One could argue that Rice fits into the old &quot;one of the good ones&quot; mold and that Lenihan did intend to belittle the majority of African-Americans. None of the talking heads I've watched have forwarded that argument though.) Perhaps I sympathize with Lenihan because I also 1) relish speaking in public and 2) frequently trip over my own tongue. I often swap the initial consonant of consecutive words. Some times I catch myself doing it; others only come to my attention when I realize I'm staring at a room of students desperately trying to suppress laughter. One of my more memorable flubs occured at a prospective graduate student party a few years back. A couple of current graduate students malingered around the punch bowl discussing the Dixie Chicks' then-recent banishment from mainstream country...</span></a></div>
