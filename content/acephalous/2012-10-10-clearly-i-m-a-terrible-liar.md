_SEK accidentally cracks [the control panel](http://www.classrooms.uci.edu/images/touchpanel.gif) on the Smart
 Lectern trying to turn on the lights after playing a clip. He calls the 
tech people. Afraid that [The Library will somehow blame him for this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/cashier.html), SEK asks his class not to tell on him. TECH PERSON arrives._

**TECH PERSON:** What happened here?
**SEK:** Don't know. Was like that when I got here.
**TECH PERSON:** (_points at the clip still displayed on the wall_) How'd that get up there then?
**SEK:** It was working at first.
**TECH PERSON:** At first? Before you got here?

_TECH PERSON looks up from behind the Smart Lectern and eyeballs SEK'S STUDENTS._

**SEK'S STUDENTS:** (_SIMULTANEOUSLY BURST INTO LAUGHTER_)
**SEK:** (_to no one and everyone_) Almost done?
**SEK'S STUDENTS:** _(WEEPING UNCONTROLLABLY_)
**TECH PERSON:** (_turning on the lights_) All done.
**SEK:** Thank you. Now as for _you_ lot ...
