## Now For Something Completely Different: Lessig vs. The American BoyChoir

Quickly: Everyone who knows me knows my love for Lessig.  Check out [this article](http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/12061/index.html).  I'll leave the legal analysis up to the experts, so this'll be short.  

Imagine you're a lawyer defending someone against charges of sexual molestation.  Imagine you arrive in court to find that the person accusing your client has hired a new attorney.  The plaintiff isn't wealthy.  You're not worried.  Then:  

In. 

Walks.  

Lawrence.  

Lessig.

Imagine you shit your shorts.  Imagine you look for somewhere to hide.  Imagine you shit your shorts again when it's revealed that the plaintiff wasn't the only one molelsted by your client:

So.

Was.

Lawrence.

Lessig.

Give 'em every last bit of what they deserve, Lawrence:

Every.  

Last.  

Bit.

EDIT: To those who emailed me saying this post was inappropriately
glib, I want to say that 1) I understand where you're coming from, 2) I
appreciate that you maintained a civil tone in your responses, but 3)
my admiration for Lessig and his work compels me to think in these
terms.  I'm not making light of what he's had to suffer through; I'm
expressing a grander social gratification that he's not only managed to survive it but is in a
position to do something about it.  Many people don't and aren't.

Obviously what "you" do in this situation is to reveal in court that Lessig was molested, by way of a casual putdown.  A moron and an asshole both.

i loved your post. Professor Lessig has been so helpful to me. "In walks Lawrence Lessig...". I can't begin to tell you how proud I am that he along with attorneys at Piper Rudnick has represented me.

I am john hardwicke, the plaintiff in a lawsuit against the American Boychoir School where I and uncounted numbers of children were sexually abused by choir directors and staff members.

You can read more about the American Boychoir and how it institutionalized sexual abuse over several decades at www.AmericanBoyschoir.com

I want to thank Professor Lessig for his assistance as my attorney in this case. He is a fine and courageous individual.

Please help us to clarify New Jersey's Charitable Immunity Act which has been interpreted by the state's courts to shield non profit organizations from all claims of negligence.

E-mail Assemblyman Albio Sires who has refused to post Assembly Bill 2512. Urge him to post and pass A2512 to do away with Charitable Immunity in cases of child sexual abuse. Ask Mr. Sires to protect New Jersey's children and help victims of sexual abuse find healing and closure.

E-mail the assemblyman at asmsires@njleg.org

Please feel free to re-post this message to as many web sites, blogs and bulletin boards as possible. Through your letters of support we hope to move Mr. Sires to action.

You can read more about this legislation at www.FixTheLaw.org
