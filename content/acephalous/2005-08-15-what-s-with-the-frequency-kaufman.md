Thank you for asking, but the dissertating's going extremely well right now so I haven't a waking moment to spare on anything but it.

Tomorrow, however, is another day.  If the history of my work habits has taught me anything, it's that the day after a day like today could be spent scrubbing floors for all the good it'll do my dissertation.  To put it another way: 

There's an 80%!c(MISSING)hance of unproductivity tomorrow.

Yes indeed: I wrote 11 pages yesterday, and went for a long drive today, giving me a chance to catch up on the Sufjan Stevens album.  Back to the grindstone tomorrow.  And then another drive.

There are two types of grad students: the tortoises and the hares.  I'm very bunny-like, or even cat-like: lots of sleep followed by bursts of senselessly directed energy.  

(And Scott, as the father of many cats, I'm sure you can agree: having cats around while working makes napping that much harder to resist.)
