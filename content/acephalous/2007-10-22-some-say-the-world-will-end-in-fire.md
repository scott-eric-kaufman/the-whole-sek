Shot this afternoon ([full size](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2056/1696728367\_8642d57c9f\_b.jpg)) about ten minutes before I provided an [update](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/cashier.html#comment-87281570) on my [miraculous mugging](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/cashier.html).    

Why is the Southern California sky a curious shade of pinkish orange?  I believe this has something to do with it:

But I've been wrong before.  

(For reference, Irvine's conveniently located beneath the flaming icon to the right of Huntington Beach.)

Well here it's not pink, but ashy gray and we're having weird soot stuff --- or possibly all the topsoil left exposed from our last massive fire --- blown into the air and collecting on every flat surface. I'm feeling sick and lightheaded. Still pumping out the applications though! Who knows what they will find when they open the materials --- strangely hallucinatory job letters dusted with a fine black powder.

I love to watch the soot fall and quietly blanket my porch.

No, wait, I don't.  I _hate_ it, because it gets in every nook, every crack, and kills my plants.

You have an actual porch!?!?!?!?!?

I'm so jealous. 

I can't even close my windows due to the stuffiness, so the soot blanket is inside where my cats can play in it. ick!

When I lived up the hill, I had a porch.  Down here, I have a tiny place on which to put plants.  (Not chairs, or a grill, or anything of the sort.)  Of course, up the hill, the apartments are ill-lit caves, but still ... incredible porches.

I didn't notice anything weird about the sky today. This has only added fuel to fire of my wife's conviction that I never have any idea what's going on around me.

it looks very apocalyptic and "judgment of god" kind of a scenario - i see Sodom and Gomorrah: streets full of people with masks and slicky RVs: "what's that stuff in the air, scott?" - "fuck that i know, john!" kaboom! the shit hits the fan and lot and his lot are driving away in a stolen RV, wife cannot resist the temptation, glances in the rear-view mirror and, shizaam, she is a pillar of salt - what kind of salt, i wonder? RV crashes, lot is unconscious, daughters forced to have sex with him... my tea is ready, vision is now very blurry - wait, i see library burning down forever burying the secret of $2640.

this morning i had a vision of your blog being attacked by some kind of "wow power" commenting machine - being late for my train, i did not have time to investigate and now it's gone - maybe i am seeing things...
