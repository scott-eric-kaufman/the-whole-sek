## Take my wife—<em>please</em>.

The party of family values seems to having problems [valuing the family sport](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/romney-puts-horse-sized-distance-between-himself-and-dressage/):

It’s a big, exciting experience for my wife. I have to  tell you, this is  Ann’s sport. I’m not even sure which day the sport  goes on.  She will get the chance to see it, I will not be watching the  event. I  hope her horse does well.

Of all the many problems with this statement, the least of them is  Romney’s use of a definitive article before the word “sport.” Not that  suggesting you say things like “Darling, I’ll be out performing the  sport this morning” doesn’t make you sound like a caricature of a  half-blind aristocrat using a mallet at crutch as he bumbles toward some  wickets, mind you. Because that’s a problem. But the real problem is  that it demonstrates that Romney’s willing to disavow _anyone_ who  might impede his candidacy. That he’s not sure “which day the sport  goes on” isn’t an indictment of him as a candidate—it’s an indictment of  him _as a husband_. Admittedly, I only have one wife, so I’m  sure if I had—what I mean is that as someone who also only has one wife,  I can’t imagine a situation in which I’d be blasé about her _representing America in the Olympics_, especially when I was _campaigning to become the President of America_.

I can only assume he’s courting the calloused husband vote here,  because I can’t think of who else he’d be trying to impress with this  brilliant bit of campaign rhetoric.  (Which assumes this statement is  intentional, being that this is part of [his charm offensive](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/07/mitt-romney-diplomat) and all—but of course it isn’t. This is just garden-variety  faux-machismo that Romney’s using to pander to conservatives who’d never  heard the word “dressage” before but immediately associated it with  vaginas.)

Romney: 
But just the honor of being here and representing our country and seeing the other Olympians is … something which I’m sure the people that are associated with this are looking forward to. Continuing: "The rest of us are bored to shit.  I only pay attention to things that are important."
