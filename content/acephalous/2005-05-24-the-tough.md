When the dissertating gets tough, the tough get [denunciating the work of one of Canada's leading lighted literary luminaries](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the\_canadian\_sf\_canon\_and\_the\_vexing\_case\_of\_margaret\_atwood/#1243); [offending without intent](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the\_canadian\_sf\_canon\_and\_the\_vexing\_case\_of\_margaret\_atwood/#1247); [spilling _Geistesgeschichte_'s beans](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the\_canadian\_sf\_canon\_and\_the\_vexing\_case\_of\_margaret\_atwood/#1254); [and into conversations about the relative merits of Philip K. Dick's early, middle and late periods](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the\_canadian\_sf\_canon\_and\_the\_vexing\_case\_of\_margaret\_atwood/#1264).  The Tough also ignores the [original post](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the\_canadian\_sf\_canon\_and\_the\_vexing\_case\_of\_margaret\_atwood/) once some momentum builds in [the comments](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the\_canadian\_sf\_canon\_and\_the\_vexing\_case\_of\_margaret\_atwood/#comments), and for that the Tough apologizes...toughly.  The Tough would also like to inform its readers that fear of being proved the solipsist the Tough is prevents the Tough from responding to John Holbo's [traffic inflatin' nod](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/does\_darwin\_hate\_iguanas\_does\_melville\_hate\_librarians/) in the Tough's general direction.  Did the Tough mention the Tough [can't spell](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the\_canadian\_sf\_canon\_and\_the\_vexing\_case\_of\_margaret\_atwood/#1267)?  Or [remember the names of movies the Tough Tough-loves](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the\_canadian\_sf\_canon\_and\_the\_vexing\_case\_of\_margaret\_atwood/#1274)?

The Tough would also like to inform Tough Readers that, appearances notwithstanding, the Tough endorses no solution to the problem of ["male and female intimacy intimasy,"](http://www.wide-find.com/m/male\_intimacy.html) nor does the Tough have an opinion on [Brad and Angelina](http://www.49media.com/sw=Brad+Pitt).  Finally, [Google lies](http://www.google.com/search?q=acephalous.typepad&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official).  [The Tough is not a beautiful model nor is the Tough available for Live Sex Chat](http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=6&q=http://www.site-de-boules.com/uk/Chat-live-with-beautiful-models.php&e=10313).

And "The Tough" bit has officially worn out its welcome...three paragraphs ago.
