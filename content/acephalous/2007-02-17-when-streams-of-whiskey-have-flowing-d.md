(_This PSA is inspired by a romp through YouTube in search of Pogues' performances.  If you're unsure why such a search would be undertaken, download [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/fallfromgrace.mp3)._)

One minute, you're on top of the world, doing shoots with Johnny Depp:

Then you drink

And drink

And drink
  

[![Shanedrink2](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/shanedrink2.jpg "Shanedrink2")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/shanedrink2.jpg)
  

And drink your teeth away:
  

[![Shanehits2help](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/shanehits2help.jpg "Shanehits2help")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/shanehits2help.jpg)
  

You try to hide them what ain't there by pointing at bears:
  

[![Shanehits5whereami](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/shanehits5whereami.jpg "Shanehits5whereami")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/shanehits5whereami.jpg)
  

But even you don't believe you.  Nor do you know where you are, or where you've been.  So you take to scrawling your name everywhere:
  

[![Shanehitsdefaminginhisname](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/shanehitsdefaminginhisname.jpg "Shanehitsdefaminginhisname")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/shanehitsdefaminginhisname.jpg)
  

Now you won't lose yourself.  Only you do:
  

[![Shanehitshelpless](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/shanehitshelpless.jpg "Shanehitshelpless")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/shanehitshelpless.jpg)
  

Lost, you hurt yourself somehow:
  

[![Shanetheendshanechair2002](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/shanetheendshanechair2002.jpg "Shanetheendshanechair2002")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/shanetheendshanechair2002.jpg)
  

And being hurt, it pisses you off:
  

[![Shanetheendmadshaneinchair](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/shanetheendmadshaneinchair.jpg "Shanetheendmadshaneinchair")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/shanetheendmadshaneinchair.jpg)
  

Shane MacGowan, you first broke my heart with your voice.  
  

Now, your life strangles mine from me.
  

Still . . . if I should fall from grace with God:

Wow that's depressing. 

I'm still digesting your theory about the theories of theory. Maybe I'll be back and comment on it in a bit.

Thanks for posting this. I love the Pogues, and Shane MacGowan's teeth are certainly worthy of a photo essay all their own. I hope his life becomes less tragic soon though.

When I was in Ireland, I heard stories about people literally tripping over Shane MacGowan in darkened alleyways where he was sitting alone with a bottle. Some of them would ask if he wanted something more from the public down the street. Apparently, whenever the police find him that way, they tell him he's a genius and leave him there, declining to arrest him.

I'm afraid the romantic idea of the Irish poet/drunk is killing him just a surely as the drink itself is.

If nothing else, we can buy ourselves CDs of _Rum, Sodomy, & the Lash_ once more, and raise a pint in memory to his best. God, how I wore my cassette out, and ran the needle down into the grooves of my vinyl.

We all go astray, one way or another. Some choose merely to rush ahead and explore.

kugelmass sent me over here... The Pogues have been the soundtrack to some really wonderful times in my life, so this makes me sad. Possibly even more sad than their rendition of The Band Played Waltzing Matilda. I am putting on Rum, Sodomy and the Lash right now, and rummaging around for the whisk(e)y.

No lie, buddy.  I stretched the tape in my cassette to the point that the sonic distortion became a tone poem in its own right.

Pogue Mahone!

I am one who thinks that Shane is a great great song writer.

I am sad to think that we will hear less of Shane just like Freddie Mercury was "taken" away from  us. 

I am torn between personal responsibility and...you know the rest.

Take care,

Mickey

(Drunk Browsing leads to commenting on dead threads :) )

It's been said that a flame that burns will surely burn out and a flame that burns as brightly as he will burn out all the quicker. If Shane wasn't the "Drunk Irish Poet" that he is, would we be as passionate about him and his work as we are?

An embarassing 'plastic paddy' who made a few very good records but disgraced himself with his offensive comments (and performance) at Guilfest and behaviour in general. He is sadly as famous for being a waster as anything else. Grow up, you tragic man. Would you be proud if your children grew up to be Shane MacGowan? Of course not! I would rather sire a responsible failure than an educated 'successful' fool.
