I arrived in London on a Virgin Atlantic flight into Heathrow.  I spent the majority of my time in London on a walking tour without purpose.  For example, one time I walked from Crouch End, in the north of London, into Soho, which is nearly eight miles away in the heart of the city.  A different day found me trekking from Crouch End to Ford Street, which is also nearly eight miles away, in search of [this gift for my wife](http://www.smythson.com/SmythsonSite/product/Mara%!C(MISSING)ollection\_View%!a(MISSING)ll/WP-RF3036.htm).  So as I sat in Heathrow yesterday awaiting my return flight,\* I found it fitting all the televisions were broadcasting the

I don't normally watch marathons, but in the terminal I felt as if these world class athletes who bore the name of my airline on their chests _were_ _running for me_.  It felt as though, in a mere three hours, they had kindly recapitulated my weeks of flânerie so that I might better remember the street feel a city I may never step foot in again.

Clearly you shop at Smythson's because David Cameron's wife is the creative director.

Never say never. You are to young to say I will never be here again. All you have to do is go somewhere near a volcano and I am sure you will find yourself with a FORCED vacation!!  You had an adventure and you used your time well.  You could have spent those days in an airport waiting for a plane that would not come for days.  You were among the few lucky ones.  You had a good, kind friend take you in and "put up with" your crazy American ways.  Now you will have a story to tell when you are old.  Just don't keep telling it to the same people over and over again like some old people you know.
