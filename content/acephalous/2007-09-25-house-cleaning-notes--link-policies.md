## House-Cleaning Notes & Link Policies

RSS readers won't be able to tell, but I've rearranged the site.  Click over to see the new, cleaner _Acephalous_.  The most significant change is that I've removed the unsightly nightmare of my previous "Best of ..." and replaced it with these:

[![image](http://acephalous.typepad.com/earlyyearspic2.jpg)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/09/the\_best\_of\_ace.html)
  

[![image](http://acephalous.typepad.com/GROWINGPAINS1.jpg)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/09/the-best-of-ace.html)

Those will take you directly to "The Best of ..." parts one and two.  More tweaking will occur shortly.

The second and more substantive issue: I receive many emails (and not infrequent comments, most of which I delete) about swapping links.  My link policy is simple: if I read you, I'll add you to the blogroll.  If I don't, I won't.  

However, I don't spend much time peering at my site logs or playing on _Technorati_, so if you've linked to me and think I'm being haughty by not responding, well, I'm not.  I can't read things I don't know exist.  If your blogging software doesn't allow you to trackback, send me an email and I'll take a look.

Also email if you've written something you think I'll like and/or want to respond to.  

For that matter, if you regularly write things you think I'll like, leave a comment below and hawk your blog.  There's no shame in self-promotion, and I'm always interested in finding new voices.

An easy way to get Scott to read all of your stuff; simply write it all as comments on his blog.

At least, I think that he reads it.  Hmm.

Where is the five-hundred-comment thread, anyway?  I think that's better preserved in the "Best of" than the ostensibly about Foucault post that it was a reaction to.

OK, I give up.  What is the second image of?  I can't get it to appear any larger no matter how many times I click it.  

At first I was thinking some sort of bizare cross between a manatee and a lion (a lianatee; it's basically my favorite animal), but now I've settled on a polar bear crying underwater.  But that's just wrong.

_I've settled on a polar bear crying underwater. But that's just wrong._

Actually, it isn't.  It's a [polar bear crying underwater](http://acephalous.typepad.com/polarbear.jpg).  (Bathing, actually, I think.  I wish I remember where I'd grabbed that from.  I _hate_ not being able to credit the photographer.)

(Rich, I purposely didn't respond to your comment, but in this case, "null response" wouldn't have been the right method of indicating "null response.")

Wow, so sad and so wet at the same time.  

If that doesn't cry out to be made into a LOLar bear then I don't know what does.

I got it from Boing Boing, and they got it from [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ucumari/sets/72057594085129925/).  Where, incidentally, I believe it originates.  In case, you know, that genealogy helps you retrace your steps, in your quest to credit the photog.

I would like to add, if I might: goddamnit!  I hate it when my butterfingers don't close link syntax.

And, I'm an RSS lurker + Enjoyer of your handiwork.

Closed that link for you, Flowbear.  (And reading your name "aloud" in my head, the pun becomes apparent.  Coffee, stat!)  And yes, that must be where I found it.  Attribution, go!

Is that spelling of Acephalous intentional? Did I miss a joke?

I haven't got the pun yet either.

No, it wasn't a joke, just a mistake.  But funny enough, I'm tempted to leave it.  It's so perfectly aligns with what non-bloggers think, after all, of our rambling, unedited screeds...

...as for the pun, well, _Madame_ Sharon_y_, it took me a while too.

Alright, so I corrected them on the sidebar, but left the uncorrected ones here, as eternal proof of my (stereotypical blogger) idiocy.

It's a solid B pun.  Easier to get than Rambo (F)... but not nearly as easy as Cock Toe (A+).

But... Madam Sharony?

Wow.  Drawn and quoted.
