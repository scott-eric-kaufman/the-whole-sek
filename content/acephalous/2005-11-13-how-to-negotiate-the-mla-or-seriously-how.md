## How to Negotiate the MLA; or, Seriously, How?

[_X-posted blah blah blah_]

As I browse through the catalogue for the upcoming MLA, I see that
there will be a number of unpleasant decisions to be made.  All of them
boil down to: “Here or here?”

Do I seat myself at promptly 10:15 on Wednesday morning at the panel
on “Citizenship and United States Writing” on which Brook Thomas, one
of my dissertator adivors, sits; or do I attend the special session on
“Covering Academe,” during which [Scott McLemee](http://mclemee.com/id4.html)
will be discussing what it’s like to be “Outside, Looking In”?  This
anecdote pretty much sums up the panic I’ll feel when I hit my hotel
room on Monday and try to decipher the highlighting schemes I’ve
concocted--yellow for “of interest, takes precedence over hunger,”
orange for “of interest, but doesn’t,” &c.  

One panel contributors and readers of the Valve will want to attend is the one on “Walter Benn Michael’s _Our America_
Ten Years Later.” Presenters include Wai Chee Dimock, Kenneth Warren
(who spoke at Irvine last year and who I cannot recommend highly
enough), and our very own Sean McCann; Michaels himself will respond.  

Quick questions of a more general nature: How many panels before you
burn out?  (At the International James Joyce conference a couple of
years ago, I drove everyone, myself included, insane by attending three
panels a day for four days straight.  I think that may cross the line
between “responsible” and “unhealthy.") What exactly is a “cash bar”? 
How do I get invited to all the best parties?  Is dress “business
casual,” and if so, what exactly does that mean?  Which David Lodge
novels should I re-read before attending?  Or has Lodge been
superseded?  Is it considered bad form to slip quietly out of the
Q&A session, or is a convincing enough cough fit a better tactic? 
(I kid, I kid.  If I left during the Q&A session, I wouldn’t be
able to ask the question I’d spent the last half of each presentation
perfecting.)

Finally, if you can think of any panels of general interest, feel
free to offer suggestions.  I’m thinking “Web Logs as Witness” (Friday,
8:30-9:45) may interest may of us, since we think about the relation of
scholarship to blogs to community regularly.  I’m tempted to forget,
temporarily, what I learned during nine years of speech therapy and
pull rank at the “Deaf Critical Theory and Practice” panel . . . but
then I remember that I’m a scholar, not a performance artist, and that
such a performance would be considered offensive.  (Then again, had I
not written this, they wouldn’t have known about the corrective therapy
and could’ve mistaken me for the man I would’ve been without it.  But
that, my friends, would be cruel.  When I speak as I once spoke, I am
utterly unintelligible.  One summer after I’d completed S.T., I
volunteered to help train the speech therapists at the unfortunately
acronymed LSD [The Louisiana School for the Deaf].  They said that the
particular combination of what I heard vs. what I produced was one of
the most bizarre pronunciation schemes they’d ever encountered.  But I
sound like Tom Brokaw now, so none of you need worry that you’ll come
down with a case of the “come agains” if we meet at the MLA.)

A cash bar is one at which you can order bills (or, if you're a skinflint, coins) of various denominations and countries of origin.  It's considered polite to tip the bartender by giving him or her something to drink in exchange.
