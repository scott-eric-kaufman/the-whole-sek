## Dead Speak

More and more often these todays blogs that were once one thing are now another.  They are concept vehicles for speaking from the beyond death of a blog.  The new blind spot, the methods and the materials of its posts, contain the magnetic allure of a beloved URL but the soul of avoiding triggering spam filters for SOA by emphasizing things which resemble luxury sentences.

A unique feature of these zombie blogs is that they are designed to stand out further thanks to mentioning items like Monaco Red Leather accents and a starting MSRP of convertible, so they will not kill your bank account.  That they will not kill your bank account is obvious because blogs with such a convenient starting MSRP is a nonsense that nonetheless is factored in by discriminating consumers of SOA.

Performance: these posts will continue to offer since the 2005 when I opened a rear suspending internet blog with a graceful level of quality.  Should you ever read actual posts that perform at the high level of quality that this one does know that would not be indifferent or apathetic unless I no longer had any use for a car, which to me is more than a mode of transportion.

[_Note: I'm not going to link to any of these Google Reader zombies for the obvious reason that that's what they want me to do_.]
