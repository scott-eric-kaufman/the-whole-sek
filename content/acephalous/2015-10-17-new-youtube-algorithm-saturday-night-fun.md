Apparently YouTube changed its search algorithm, allowing access to material previously available only in theory, and because it's Saturday night, I thought I'd share some of what I've found that has an SEK twist to it. First, when I went to find the video of _Hamilton_'s first cabinet rap-battle, I found a slew of videos of cast members entertaining those in lottery line for tickets. I was watching this one when I realized that the woman they pulled out was my friend Kendra! (Who you may remember [from this podcast](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2015/05/lawyers-guns-money-podcast-age-of-ultron-with-sek-kendra-pettis-and-arturo-garcia).) If you're wondering whether I freaked out when she appeared, wonder no more -- I freaked the freaking fuck out. Also, the following is a testament to the show's power, even when it's being performed a capella on the streets of NYC:

The second item I stumbled into is truly TARDIS-worthy, given that it's an Uncle Tupelo show from 1994 in which 1) Jay and Jeff weren't actively engaged in fisticuffs and 2) I was in attendance. I'd never been to St. Louis before and didn't know who Uncle Tupelo were, but after that night, I was a fan for life. Somewhere in that crowd of bobbing heads is an 18-year-old SEK who has no clue what life's about to start offering him. It's a strange form of nostalgia, watching a crowd you know you're in and wishing the next 21 years doesn't happen to him too.
