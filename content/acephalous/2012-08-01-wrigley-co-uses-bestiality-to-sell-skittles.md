## “Wrigley Co. Uses Bestiality to Sell Skittles”

I lack the parodic skills required to improve the title or content of John Nolte’s [latest screed](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2012/08/01/Skittles-Bestiality). But I’ll try to shorter it anyway:

I used to laugh at loud at the term “slippery slope.”

Then I grew up.

AND WHEN I GREW UP LESBIANS WERE MAKING OUT WITH WALRUSES.

Can you tell which sentence I wrote? Me neither. Did I write this?

If you don’t think there’s an agenda behind this, you  haven’t been  paying attention the last 40 years. And if you don’t think  that there  are those who hold the levers of power in our popular  culture that would  like to remove the stigma from bestiality, you don’t  understand the  depths of sexual depravity the human animal is capable  of.

Or what about this?

Again, what was the point of feminism?  Here’s your real  war on  women.  Waving enough money in front of an actress and have her  do  whatever depravities you can dream of.  Liberated?  If by that you  mean  women are to be accorded no respect and you can expect any female  to do  anything because to say no would be so uncool. Abortion liberates  men because it allows them to walk away.  And if  they pay for the  abortion then they’re the good guy, taking  responsibility.

Parody is dead. Long live actresses who kiss aborted walruses!

This is nothing new: 30 or 40 years or (never saw the publication, only the clipping) someone (probably Playboy) ran a cartoon with a similar mixed-species couple in bed, and the caption was something like "I never knew what a true orgasm was until I discovered tusks."

And let's face it, the mermaid myth... 

Oh, never mind. It's filler. It was a slow day, 'cause the "Obama will declare martial law to avoid the election" thing isn't ripe yet. (Yes, I remember the "Bush could declare an emergency and void the election" talk on the left. It made sense at the time.)

But he'll fake his own assassination to do so, that's the kicker. I've got to say: it's a banner day for crazy if you're on the right. I'm sort of agog, honestly.

Which is deeply creepy, if you think about it: if Obama were assassinated, the right would _already have a conspiracy theory in place_ insulating them from responsibility in which it were his own fault, and not true besides.
