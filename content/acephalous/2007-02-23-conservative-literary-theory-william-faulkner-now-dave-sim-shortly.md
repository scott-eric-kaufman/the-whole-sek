## Conservative Literary Theory: William Faulkner now, Dave Sim shortly

I often wonder what conservative literary theory would look like.  Reading through Malcolm A. Kline's [complaints about the MLA](http://www.campusreportonline.net/main/articles.php?disp=January&yr=2007&type=5)—which continue well into February—I gather that it would emphasize the appreciation of great literature.  What would qualify as great literature is obvious: [Dickens](http://www.campusreportonline.net/main/articles.php?id=1452), for one; [Shakespeare](http://www.campusreportonline.net/main/articles.php?id=1441), for another.  But I come here to bury Kline, not point out the obvious fact that his paragons of literature were considered base in their own time.  (Doing so would mock his kicker of a finale to that [second article](http://www.campusreportonline.net/main/articles.php?id=1441), in which he laments the erosion of historical knowledge.  I do too.  Only it seems we read different histories.) 

[![Lightfirstedition](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/lightfirstedition.jpg "Lightfirstedition")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/lightfirstedition.jpg)But  I feel constructive tonight, by which I mean: I want to say something positive about the tension necessarily created by the representation of "core values" in literary texts.  In the classroom, I would teach this by having the students read Faulkner's [_Light in August_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679732268/diesekoschmar-20) (1932).  That there on your left is the cover to the first edition.  Click on it and examine with care.  Can you tell the race of the man it depicts?  If you haven't read the novel, the answer should be firmly in the negative; but if you have, you'll be no less confused.  The race of the protagonist, Joe Christmas, is both specular (in the novel) and speculative (to the readers).  So maybe you can't tell anything about his race, but what about his class?  Does the tilt of his hat signify?  The cut of his clothes?  What about his slumped shoulders?  The gentle forward cant—half performed cool, half pure exhaustion—does it signify? 

 It should. 

What happens in _Light in August_—not to mention much of what follows—is that Faulkner forces himself to consider the disconnect between his sympathies with poor itinerant whites and the casual racism which life in Oxford demanded.  In fine, _Light in August_ is the book in which you can see sympathy and ideology clash in the philosophical mess of an artfully constructed novel.  If pressed, I would argue that Faulkner emerged from his racism sometime in the writing of this book.  The brilliance of this novel—as well as the five to follow—are born of his struggle against the values he'd uncritically breathed living as he did, when he did.  

And they are, by far, the height of his artistic achievement.  Someone like Kline, for whom all art is instrumental, ends up parroting the claims of the liberal ideologues he denounces.  All his high-minded talk of high literature obscures the conflict of conscience implicit in its creation.  By advocating this purity of spirit approach, Kline accepts the assumptions of his ideological opponents.  Thus, my kicker:

He doesn't desire Shakespeare so much as an ideologically inverted Mike Gold:
America, O step-mother, you struck us from the light,  
You made us slaves and clowns, you kept us in our place.  
But History has spoken, and breaking thru the night,  
We artists and thinkers shall bless our martyred race.

That's from Gold's atrocious _Hoboken Blues:_ _or The Black Rip Van Winkle: A Modern Negro Fantasia on an Old American Theme_ (1930).  You see my point.  Literature as ideology?  Dull.  Literature as the struggle against ideology?  Alright.  Literature as the struggle against one's own ideology?

Awesome.

All of which is a prelude to a couple of posts about anti-feminism, Dave Sim and _Cerebus_.

"I often wonder what conservative literary theory would look like."

Isn't Harold Bloom now the best-known representative of serious conservative literary theory?  As an outside observer, that's the impression I get.  He can be counted on for the usual conservative defenses of the Western canon, or for gibes about those newfangled forms (poetry slams are the death of poetry!), but you can't say that he's unintellectual or unserious or merely political.

Of course, I haven't actually \*read\* any Bloom.  I figure that I should at some point, given that he's apparently made some connection between Gnosticism and SF long before I did, so I've been stockpiling whichever of his books I've happened to see at $3 used book stores -- but, as always, the time for serious reading is deferred several months into the future.

_...you can't say that he's unintellectual or unserious or merely political._

I don't know, I think Harold Bloom is pretty unserious these days, or at least deserves to be taken unseriously.  All he seems to do his beat his chest and shout "Shakespeare, Shakespeare, Shakespeare!" which, more than anything, is just boring.

He may be a "conservative critic," but I think that it's certainly possible to have serious conservative criticism that engages with "Literature as the struggle against one's own ideology," and is much more than an old, stuffy "Appreciating the Classics" shtick.

Can anyone think of a critic you may be conservative but is not irrelevant, like Bloom?  Someone who actually has interesting ideas?

Bloom is old, and I don't think it's fair to judge someone's work by their elder years.  From what little I know of his work about the anxiety of influence and about creative misreading, it certainly seems to be a serious attempt at literary theory, even if you disagree with it.

I don't think anyone's going to deny the seriousness of Bloom's early work.  For example, here's [Said on Bloom](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0300-7162%!(NOVERB)
