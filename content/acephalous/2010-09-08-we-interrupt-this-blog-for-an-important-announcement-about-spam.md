While I'm heartened to see that _Big Hollywood_ didn't even place or show, the prize for the illustrious honor of being the twentieth best film blog in September is, so far as I can tell, being bombarded by sandal-spam.  So if comments end up in moderation, it's not because I hate you, or don't brook dissent, or am censoring you, but because I've switched my spam-phaser from "stun" to "kill."  Have no fears: if you're an actual person whose comment gets caught in the crossfire, I know how to reanimate you.  (Odd that I prefer zombie-comments to spam, but that's the way of the world these days.)
