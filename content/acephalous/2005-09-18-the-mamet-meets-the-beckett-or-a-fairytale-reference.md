Maybe[![21spartan](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/images/21spartan.jpg "21spartan")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/21spartan.jpg) Mamet moves more briskly when watched in an insomnious state, but in the midst of a battle with wakefulness unlike any I've waged lately I thoroughly enjoyed his [_Spartan_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0360009/).  (Why I had insomnia after a night of feigning a prodigious drunk baffles me.  Had I imbibed an abnormal amount of high-octane alcohol last night I would no doubt have passed out like a petrified log.  Instead I stood giant like the sequoia, surveying the vast expanse of consciousness that lay before and behind me and praying for an illegal timber outfit to clear-cut me out of my misery.  But I dendro-digress.)  In _Spartan_, Robert Scott belongs to the government agency involved in the operations.  As the film opens, the woman being chased by the man in the woods passes the seated Scott.  The man sees Scott then looks at the woman.  The woman stops running and shrugs.  Scott turns to the man.  Says
You've had your whole life to prepare for this moment.  Why aren't you ready?

The man claims he is and runs after the woman who seeing the man resume chasing resumes fleeing.  Cut to the military barracks.  The woman loudly informs Scott of her prowess with knives in close quarters.  
**Scott:** What they got you teaching here young sergeant?  
**Black:** Edged weapons sir. Knife fighting.  
**Scott:** Don't you teach them knife fighting. Teach them to kill. That way they
meet some son of a bitch who studied knife fighting, they send his soul to
hell.

Then things happen.  The truck is driven.  The helicopter piloted.  Now Scott leads the task force to find the girl.  The girl had been kidnapped.  The government official named Burch corners Scott:
**Burch:** What about if we had to go off the meter?  
**Scott:** The door is closed sir.  
**Burch:** I need to ask you to do something.  
**Scott:** I am here to get the girl back sir.  And there is nothing I will not do to get the girl back.

Eventually the only native speaker of Mametese (William H. Macy) arrives.  The shots are fired and the credits roll.  Perhaps I exaggerate Mamet's desire to create a conspiratorial mood via the definitive article.  Perhaps.  But in _Spartan_ this technique works to spectacular effect.  Mamet employs a variation of the technique Hugh Kenner attributes to Samuel Beckett: 
Two men waiting, for another whom they know only by an implausible
name which may not be his real name. A ravaged and blasted landscape. A
world that was ampler and more open once, but is permeated with
pointlessness now. Mysterious dispensers of beatings. A man of property
and his servant, in flight. And the anxiety of the two who wait, their
anxiety to be as inconspicuous as possible in a strange environment
("We’re not from these parts, Sir") where their mere presence is likely
to cause remark. It is curious how readers and audiences do not think
to observe the most obvious thing about the world of the play, that it
resembles France occupied by the Germans, in which its author spent the
war years. How much waiting must have gone on in that bleak world; how
many times must Resistance operative—displaced person when everyone was
displaced, anonymous ordinary people for whom every day renewed the
dispersal of meaning—have kept appointments not knowing whom they were
to meet, with men who did not show up and may have had good reasons for
not showing up, or bad, or may even have been taken; how often must
life itself not have turned on the skill with which overconspicuous
strangers did nothing as inconspicuously as possible, awaiting a
rendezvous, put off by perhaps unreliable messengers, and making do
with quotidian ignorance in the principal working convention of the
Resistance, which was to let no one know any more than he had to.

We can easily see why a Pozzo would be unnerving. His every gesture
is Prussian. He may be a Gestapo official clumsily disguised.

Kenner elsewhere insists that _Waiting for Godot_ is "an absolutely realist portrait of the occupation" that could only be accomplished when a man finds himself in "a historical situation in which all the responses are cliches."  Simply "remove the clues to what the situation is" and what had been  "an absolutely realist 
    portrait of the occupation" becomes an absurdist work about two people trying to do nothing as inconspicuously as possible.  But what an evening spent in the company of Mamet forced upon me was that it isn't that the context has been stripped that so disturbs me about _Waiting for Godot_ but that the characters speak as if they still live in a world in which their definitive articles point to anything definitive.  They admit they're "not from these parts" but "these parts" consists of the ditch, the tree and the road.  That they specify that they're not from "these parts" implies that there are some identifiable parts they are from.  Where "those parts" are in relation to "these parts" is unfathomable and yet the language they speak is rife with referential implications.

The cumulative effect of this language is such that it unseats the person hearing or reading it from his or her current context.  It intoxicates whatever part of the brain processes reference with possibilities never likely to be encountered in daily life and that intoxication is experienced by those who favor Beckett as the steady buzz of fine white wine.  (Everyone else feels dosed.)  What I find compelling about Kenner's argument isn't that it denudes Beckett's play of its power to unseat (some literally, some psychologically) an audience but that it grounds this dissociation in the knowable world.  In _Spartan_ Mamet manages much the same effect.  As the film progresses it becomes increasingly unclear who "he" and "she" are or how "they" relate to "the girl" or "the handlers."  As the confusion mounts, however, the pace of the plot quickens.  The more I invested in the mounting action the less I understood but the more I wanted to.  Quite the trick Mamet employs there.  

Quite _the_ trick.  (Repeated for effect.  That "the" doesn't lack a referent.  It's right there.  See it?  Right there?)
