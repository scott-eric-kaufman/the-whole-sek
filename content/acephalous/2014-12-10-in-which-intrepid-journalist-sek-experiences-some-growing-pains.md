So I _almost_landed an interview with Kirk Cameron about why he thought his new film was [the lowest rated movie on IMDB](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/12/the-people-have-spoken-kirk-camerons-saving-christmas-is-imdbs-worst-film-of-all-time/), but I heard back from his people and apparently he found something I wrote yesterday “terribly disappointing” and called it off — which I found weird given that I didn’t work yesterday.\*

But in case you’re wondering what it’s like to be vetted by Kirk Cameron’s people, it goes something like this:

_SEK is being interviewed by Kirk Cameron’s Handler (KCH) for a potential article._  

**KCH:** Kirk wants to know if you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, Christ the Savior.  

**SEK:** I attended CCD for a few years and studied Latin in college. I translated a lot of the Church Fathers — Augustine, Aquinas, and the like.  

**KCH:** That’s really interesting, really. So you know about sin?  

**SEK:** I know more than anyone cares to about the danger stealing pears from your neighbor can pose for your soul.  

**KCH:** So you were raised Catholic?   

**SEK:** Catholic and Jewish.  

**KCH:** You know Hebrew?   

**SEK:** Passably.  

**KCH:** Kirk’s a big fan of Hebrew, big fan.   

**SEK:** It’s the only dead language to be revived.  

**KCH:** I didn’t know that, did not know. That’s really interesting. Are you gay?  

**SEK:** I am not.  

**KCH:** Good, good, just need to dot those “t”s. Have you ever been gay?  

**SEK:** I have not, but I’m not sure how that’s relevant to my ability to discuss film. Did you read the links I sent?  

**KCH:** I did, and they were great, great. Loved them, loved. But some of the language was not quite Christ-like.   

**SEK:** I can adapt to my audience — we’ve been talking for twenty minutes and I haven’t cussed once.  

**KCH:** That’s true, true. Good. What are your feelings about “gotcha” interviews?  

**SEK:** They get you one good moment, but burn your reputation for being fair-minded to people you disagree with.   

**KCH:** So you don’t like them? Hate them?  

**SEK:** I can’t do my job if people don’t trust me to treat them fairly.  

**KCH:** That sounds fair, really fair. How do you think this is going?   

**SEK:** Pretty good.   

**KCH:** I think so too. I think we can make this work. I like you.  

**SEK:** Thanks. I like to be likable.  

**KCH:** Which is why I’m worried about the state of your soul, but we can talk about that later.   

**SEK:** Do I need to be saved to do the interview?   

**KCH:** Kirk would definitely be more comfortable, definitely.   

**SEK:** ?  

**KCH:** Definitely.  

**SEK:** ?  

**KCH:** Let me pass this on to Kirk, and I’ll let you know.

\*I did however write [this](https://www.facebook.com/scotterickaufman/posts/10103004112955411) on Facebook and I suppose he could’ve found that offensive.
