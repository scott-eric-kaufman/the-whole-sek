The infodump, as Todd VanDerWerff [points out](http://www.thehousenextdooronline.com/2009/02/bsg-saturdays-season-4-ep-15-no-exit.html), may well be the single generic feature shared by all flavors of science fiction:

You might find some infodumping in a Western or in a period piece, but for the most part, we know the rules those genres play by because those genres take place in our reality, just in the past . . . . To a large degree, the division between hard and soft [science fiction] often hinges on things like infodumps. The hard [science fiction] is often for the people who are really, _really_ interested in the science part of the science fiction equation. The soft stuff skews more toward the fiction end of things and isn’t particularly concerned with plausibility much of the time.

This strikes me as wrong in one crucial respect: the infodumps about which people complain occur _at the outset_ of a work. They're presented as the technological enablers of the narrative to follow. They are exposition _before the fact_—before readers have any emotional investment in the characters whose narratives are enabled by the infodumped technology. No surprise, then, that people whose primarily invest in character or narrative find the lengthy technological preambles of hard science fiction off-putting.

To label as infodump the exposition on the _Battlestar Galactica_ episode "No Exit" is to be a little too literal. "No Exit" did "dump" quite a bit of "info" on its audience, but the information was not intended to make the narrative work, because _it already does_. You cannot have an infodump four seasons into a series: you can only have a _revelation_. The argument should be whether too much information was revealed too quickly, but what else were the characters meant to do? Naming an episode after Sartre's _[No Exit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\_Exit)_ signals a forthcoming entrapment of the character's own devising. Their Hell will be the other people they're trapped with.

But that's not where I'm headed with this post. I think the thematic parallels with Sartre's play are important—certainly significant is the implication that this is a Hell of their own devising, one in which they remain not by force or compulsion, but through fear of the unknown. (That all the characters begin by talking about what happened on Earth, only to become increasingly occupied with their own infighting seems an important parallel, even if I am being a bit literal.) What I want to focus on the effect on a viewer when almost 70 hours of thin-streaming history are followed by one of torrential exposition.

On a certain type of reader/viewer, the result is little different than the cumulative effect reading _Ulysses_ or _Gravity's Rainbow_ or _Infinite Jest_; namely, this person feels like the night sky yearns to snap into constellations—he feels like the heavens look down on, disappointed, because some personal failing prevents him from discovering the order they contain. So what does this person do?

If he's reading _Ulysses_, he maps Joyce's universe onto the tram-lines of William Martin Murphy in order to demonstrate that

[Stephen's] attempts at upward mobility are futile, frustrated in large part by Murphy’s reluctance to lower the tramfare. However, were Murphy to lower the tramfare, the people riding the tramcars would no longer comprise a tram-riding elite, and Stephen’s desire to ride the tramlines might atrophy into little more than a timesaving utilitarian impulse. Understood in this manner, Stephen becomes a pathetic figure obsessed with belonging to a class he can only feign membership in on payday.

If he's watching _Battlestar Galactica_, he writes [the following post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/02/battlestar-galactica-a-historical-timeline-of-events-leading-up-to-the-miniseries.html).

Two questions: first, where did that last quotation come from? It really sounds like parody. Second, my immediate reaction to these kinds of episodes (and I'm not actually watching BSG, but I can't help running across discussion of it here and there) is that the writers themselves are struggling with the story: the public recitation of the history _as it currently exists_ is intended to keep future writers from violating the premises of the ongoing series; it also can serve to bridge plausibility gaps, fill in narrative holes and continuity issues that have been created by sloppy or overaggressive plotting. 

Most ongoing series have a set of premises, backstories, etc. It's not an accident that these are known as the "bible" of the show.

OK, that second one didn't really develop into a question.

Zounds!  That last quotation's not a parody, it's from my Master's thesis, which I presented as a paper before the International James Joyce Society in Trieste!  Which is in Italy!

Because I'm special!

I'm . . . special.

Seriously though, I should've spent a little more time in the post demonstrating how exhaustive my research into the Dublin tramlines was before throwing that quotation out there.  Not that my conclusion wasn't absurd---I merely foisted that absurdity onto Joyce.  In a nutshell: I did an obscene amount of research in order to document which tramlines belonged to Martin, then mapped all the scenes in Joyce's _oeuvre_ onto the map of Martin's tramlines I'd devised.  I then tracked how Joyce treated each of those intersections of character-and-Martin-owned-tramline---seventeen in all---and argued that Joyce had intentionally put Stephen on that tram at that time in order to humiliate Martin.  

Sadly, my argument _works_.  I mean, if you look at it objectively, Joyce did put all those people (and their corresponding emotional valences) on those trams which belonged to that guy . . . but to claim, as I did, that it was an intentional strategy is well-nigh insane.  Joyce never cared about history in that way---I did, and I mistook my meticulousness for something in the text.  In short, I found something that just so happened to be backed up by history, but that was the turning point in my career.  I could've continued to manufacture compelling nothings, or I could try to figure out relations that actually mattered.

I only hope you know what choice I made.

Damn: I thought it might be from one of your undergrad papers -- you've cited them before as evidence of ... your subsequent maturation as a scholar and writer. I didn't know: I'm sorry. 

"You chose wisely."

Isn't there a classical form of late infodump -- the moment when the detective has all the suspects assembled in the drawing room, and harangues them with untrammeled prolixity until picking one, seemingly at random, as It?
