## Historicism, Slapped on the Wrist, then Around, only to be Reminded, via Pleas, Tears, How much It Is Loved

One reason for theory's former ubiquity was that it sped up the researching and writing processes.  No longer would a literary scholar have to read 70 novels to write a publishable article; 10 would suffice, so long as one had the applicable theory in hand.  Thus was born a vicious cycle: because it didn't take as long to write an article, departments raised the standards of how many articles were required for tenure; and if more articles could be produced, more full-length monographs could, too.  

Theory's not responsible for this acceleration, but it's certainly complicit in it.  The problem for scholars working now—in The Age of Historicism—is that they're working now, in The Age of Historicism.  Theory is not what it once was; journals and publishers are demanding articles and books with a depth commensurate to pre-theory articles and books.  The problem is, the codified acceleration of graduate and departmental standards have made it almost impossible for young scholars to produce such work.  Reading seventy novels, hundreds of short stories, the relevant critical literature—reading that much takes time young scholars don't have.  So they continue to produce theory-heavy scholarship which, unsurprisingly, hits the water with nary a splash and vanishes from sight.  

This problem is an exaggeration of an endemic institutional inequity, normally not worth the energy it takes to complain; however, the longer I work on my dissertation, the more I retrace the steps of my research and realize which tangents I shouldn't have taken, which shortcuts enable me to produce quality work quickly—the more I recognize how steep the dissertation-learning curve is, the more forcefully this particular institutional inefficiency chafes my notions of common sense and fair play.  Not that this has anything to do with me personally, or the progress of my dissertation, except that it does.  As I struggle to finish, I know that it would be in my best interest to invest myself completely in a single, overriding theory and ride it into the market.  

What's stopping me?  For one, an honest assessment of my own work, one which recognizes my strengths—close-reading based on Himalayas of research—and weaknesses—brazen assertions about the validity of this or that to something or another.  Will I ever, I wonder, produce something which meets my own standards?  Or will I be coerced by market-forces into creating a substandard monstrosity of a dissertation, which I'll follow with a parade of inadequately researched articles unacceptable at even the most mediocre journals?  Will _The Other****Henry James Review_****and****_Even More****Postmodern Culture_ reject me?  

Could I live with myself if they did?

This is very true. It's come home to me, very vividly, in the last few weeks. We are raised now, as it were, with a sense that only full expertise will do. My best piece - thankfully forthcoming soon - took ages and ages to write as it required not only a deep survey of the criticism, but some fairly extensive historical research. \* I think it's a valuable paper - I'm very proud of it. But I am quite sure that I won't write anything like it again, at least not before tenure. Quick hits only now - there simply is no time for that sort of work. I wrote it during my one year off from classwork / teaching during grad school. It took the entire year + some. 

But some of the work that I see from the previous generation - late "theory" era folks - feels like once you have the model, you could just keep churning it out over and over again and on demand. If I would be satisfied with that sort of thing, yes, life would be easier. 

(I almost think we're at a point in certain historical periods (modern, for instance) that there are two tracks - and that, in many cases, the assistant level folks coming out present more impressive looking work than do the associate level people...) There are of course major exceptions. 

My own answer, ultimately, will be not to present mediocre "just in time" type work, but rather to narrow the scope of future pieces. To do it well, but less globally. Start - and end - smaller. Know what I mean? 

\* The dark irony of this is that much of what was most time consuming has been left on the cutting room floor after a couple of revise-and-resubmits.

Is this the special case, within academia, of a more general syndrome?  I work by the hour, so I never spend as much time finishing off a project as I'd like to -- the remaining work gets cut off at the point at which someone no longer wants to pay for it, or at the stage where I don't feel like I should be billing them for it even if they'd pay for it (a form of self-censorship, I suppose).  Part of the contemporary market ethos is an increasing drive towards efficiency / productivity in symbolic work.

Isn't one point of tenure, though, to insulate you from that?  Or by the time you get it, are your habits formed?  I suppose that there is also the hierarchy within tenure of levels of professorship (which I don't understand) to keep you going.

My best piece so far is based primarily on two texts that I read in agonizing detail in the original languages (indeed, as a way of learning those languages), plus an author I've been reading basically since my freshman year in college -- primarily, a book of his that I've read close to ten times.  I feel pretty confident that I know what I'm talking about and have even hit on something new.  I also feel like I've "shot my load," if you catch my meaning.  But I'm not yet at the dissertation stage, nor even at the exam stage -- I'm sure I'll pick up some more rigorous knowledge in that process.

Was there ever really an age prior to the age of theory in which a scholar had to read 70 novels in order to publish an article?  Very roughly speaking, the disciplinary paradigm before theory was the New Criticism, which called for detailed analysis of a small number of texts.  Theory was one effort to further professionalize literary studies by yoking it to a difficult vocabulary and conceptual apparatus.  The New Historicism (or "New New Historicism"), with its emphasis upon archival work and breadth of reading in a historical period, is another such effort.

I agree with Stephen--who was it who argued that New Criticism was perfect for professors in the post-G.I. Bill era in U.S universities, as they could spin out a detailed close reading in a 50-minute lecture in all the new gen ed courses they were teaching (and teach majors same skill set), while publishing their lectures as "literary critics" rather than mere "source-hunting scholars"?  

Yet I've put the same pressures on my scholarship as Scott describes, both during and after the dissertation, which means that I've been able to publish side projects that meet my standards b/c the fields they're in and theories they deal with provided a somewhat manageable but still arduous avenue for more rapidly-developable expertise than Hawthorne studies.  It's taken me 14 years on the Hawthorne project so far to get me to the point where I feel ready to finish the book--and most of that time was devoted to teaching dozens of courses, many of which I was able to use to broaden my knowledge of multiple periods of American literature, not to mention preparing for the side projects themselves, which are now ready to take almost central stage in the Hawthorne book itself.  So I can't quite recommend my "career" path, but I would point out that probably 90%!o(MISSING)f the jobs out there won't put the pressure to publish quickly on you that you're chafing against.  Think Paul Lauter's career if you want a model for preparing yourself for the big time.

CR:

This is very true.

It's a shame you can't link to comments on Long Sunday, otherwise I'd have linked to things in which I'd argued against this (and you).  You could've been vindicated!  

But some of the work that I see from the previous generation - late "theory" era folks - feels like once you have the model, you could just keep churning it out over and over again and on demand.

Then again, so could I!

That said, I do think I've come to your way of thinking about the dangers of historicism, especially in a profession which lacks the institutional support required to produce such work.  Ideally, we shouldn't need to take a year off from our jobs in order to do them, and yet, including you, Stephen, and a couple of my friends, we've all had to.  That strikes me as a sign of a profession which doesn't know what it wants, or knows, but isn't willing to institute the changes required to accommodate it.

Still, you're right about limiting the scope of projects in order to get the work done; unfortunately, the people I work with aren't interested in my dissertation being turned into a book, but a series of publishable articles.  

Rich:

Isn't one point of tenure, though, to insulate you from that? Or by the time you get it, are your habits formed? I suppose that there is also the hierarchy within tenure of levels of professorship (which I don't understand) to keep you going.

Someday, someone will explain to me the difference between the levels of professorship, which I'm a little murky on as well.  I think tenure does insulate you from these demands, as the Constructivist's comment below indicates; and that's a problem, since the acquisition of tenure relies on being able to produce publishable work, which one can hardly do unless one has tenure.  

Adam:

To this day, my best work is still all about Joyce.  I haven't produced an Americanist paper half as good.  Like you, I acquired an insane familiarity with one book -- _Ulysses_ -- and its critical history; then I wrote a couple of papers which, to this day, I still think are quite good.

Stephen:

Was there ever really an age prior to the age of theory in which a scholar had to read 70 novels in order to publish an article?

I think there was a time in which having read 70 novels went without question.  You don't read Cleanth Brooks and wonder whether he's read _all_ of Faulkner, or Trilling and wonder whether he's read _all_ of James.  Both obviously have, in part because they were expected to.  Once that expectation disappeared, it opened the door to people reading a single book by an author and saying things like "I don't read literature anymore, I read literary theory."  (Which is, as Stephen knows, an direct quote.)

The New Historicism (or "New New Historicism"), with its emphasis upon archival work and breadth of reading in a historical period, is another such effort.

And a much more time-intensive one, since it requires not the mastery of skills -- which, yes, take time to master, but not nearly so long, at least, not to achieve the "mastery" required to do literary studies -- but the reading of Himilayas of research (_Phrase of the Week_).  One quick example: instead of reading a number of books I should have before writing my current chapter, I did extensive bibliographical research.  That research took me about as much time as it would've taken to read any two of the novels I was researching, but what choice do I have?  I can't read all the novels I should and meet deadlines.  So instead of learning how to be a sound academic, I'm learning how to _sound_ like one through the cunning use of bibliographies.  

Constructivist:

I'm not sure who said that, but it sounds like an early, pro-New Critical response to old historicism.  

As for the nature of career path, well, on the one hand it points to the value of canonical literature (as does my Joyce example above), in that it circumscribes the amount of work required to produce new readings.  It's possible to read everything Hawthorne wrote -- if I'm not mistaken, I've read everything except for a stray short story here or there, thanks to a Brook Thomas seminar devoted to him.  But as soon as you step off the smooth and canonical -- that is, as soon as you realize that, in addition to Hawthorne, there are all the people he's responding to, and all the people they're responding to, and so on -- as soon as you do that, you're on the Auerbachian path to producing _Mimesis_, a grand book which simply couldn't be written anymore.

Heh, I'm not trying to produce _Mimesis_, just trying to do for readings for race and Hawthorne what Colacurcio did for historicism in _The Province of Piety_ (except that I try to address NH's 1840s-1860s episodically and also discuss later writers whose revisions of Hawthorne reveal something significant about race in their times and also provide a primer to ways of reading race in American literature, so you can see why it's taken 14 years to get as far as I've gotten).  If this is your definition of an impossible book, I'll do my best to prove you wrong.  (But I've chosen a strange way of doing it.  Look how dumb I am:  I combined a teaching Fulbright (4/4 although that translates to something like a 3/2 with the less face time yet greater prep time) with a leave, so I don't even get the year off to finish the book as I originally planned.)

I think the idea that the new criticism was perfect for the teaching/publication demands of the post-G.I. Bill U.S. academy was a new Americanist critique of new criticism.  Lauter? Pease?  Jay?  Aaarghh, I used to have this stuff at my fingertips.  But yeah, you're right that the new critics built upon their training by old historicist mentors and probably couldn't have done what they did without it.

Probably about 50%!o(MISSING)f the departments who offer the 90%!l(MISSING)iterary positions I mentioned above put research 2nd if not 3rd when it comes down to tenure decisions.  If you don't mind a teaching load of 3/3 or higher and can find a department that limits preps and students in the process, you've got a great first job in today's market.  But, yeah, if you're aiming "higher," then research is job 1, so keep publishing all you can while you have the time as a grad student, b/c I never believed my advisors who said I'd look back on that time with envy, but...!

Loved your update of the New England Primer.  Just keep this blog up long enough to be able to look back on it....

"You don't read Cleanth Brooks and wonder whether he's read all of Faulkner, or Trilling and wonder whether he's read all of James. Both obviously have, in part because they were expected to."

I don't know, Scott.  The above seems tantamount to saying "hey, you don't read the really famous critics and writers and wonder if they knew their stuff."  Expectations may or may not have included comprehensive reading lists, but selecting folks as examples who were comprehensive and who we know about today in part because of that comprehensiveness doesn't seem to me to indicate any historical, historicist continuum, if only because there will be ten times the number of those examples of people who vanished into the folds of history, presumably because their work lacked something - writing acumen, comprehensiveness, whatever.  Really you just seem to be saying that doing really good work takes an awful lot of effort and time, and can be really, really hard.  No surprise there.  

The dirty secret of every discipline is the copious number of mediocre or worse PhD holders who practice in that discipline's name, and I would suggest that this has vastly more influence on the current pressures than does the introduction of theory.  To be honest, to assume that someone simply picks up a theory and runs with it, and that doing so shortens their work time, seems more an indication of your own interactions with people skimping on their theoretical research and on their thinking through of theoretical issues.  What you're referring to as theory here, when done right, takes serious time, and page for page it takes far more time than a critical examination of a novel.  Anyway, my point being: it seems unfair to praise historicism based on an anecdotal celebration of its most rigorous and comprehensive adherents and then malign a more theoretical approach based a generalized complaint about its lazier practitioners.

_To be honest, to assume that someone simply picks up a theory and runs with it, and that doing so shortens their work time, seems more an indication of your own interactions with people skimping on their theoretical research and on their thinking through of theoretical issues._

I actually think this is one discussion where the theory / Theory distinction is helpful - if it can mean the difference between writing "foundational" works of theory vs. derivative works of theoretically inflected lit crit. Of course, of course, Grammatology took a huge amount of effort. I'm not sure, however, that your run of the mill theory-heavy monograph works the same way. Building the machine, and throwing texts through the machine once it's built are two very different processes.

Oops. I meant to quote a bit more of Ken's comment: 

_To be honest, to assume that someone simply picks up a theory and runs with it, and that doing so shortens their work time, seems more an indication of your own interactions with people skimping on their theoretical research and on their thinking through of theoretical issues.

There. That's better.
