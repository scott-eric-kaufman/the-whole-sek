West of Apartment Complex
](http://acephalous.typepad.com/zork.jpg)

You are standing in an open field west of a white apartment complex, with a boarded front door.  There is a small mailbox here.

&gt; e

The door is locked.  There is evidently no key.

&gt; take key

I don't understand that.

&gt; kick down door

I don't understand that.

&gt; w

You are in a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  One particularly large tree with some low branches stands here.

&gt; climb tree

You are about ten feet above the ground nestled among some large branches.  The nearest branch above you is beyond your reach.  On the branch is a small birds nest.  The birds nest contains: A jewel-encrusted egg.

&gt; take egg

Taken.

&gt; throw egg

You must supply an indirect object.

&gt; throw egg at grammar nazi

&gt; e

You are standing in an open field west of a white apartment complex, with a boarded front door.  There is a small mailbox here.

&gt; s

You are behind a white townhouse.  In one corner of the townhouse there is a window which is slightly ajar.

&gt; open window

With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow passage.

&gt; 
climb in window

You are in the kitchen of the white townhouse.  A table seems to have
been used recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to
the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the
east is a small window which is open.
On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.
A clear glass bottle is here.
The glass bottle contains: A quantity of water.

&gt; open sack

Opening the brown sack reveals:   
A clove of garlic.   
A lunch.

&gt; eat lunch

Taken.  Thank you very much.  It really hits the spot.

&gt; w

You are in the study of the townhouse.  A desk has recently been used to write a dissertation.  A door leads to a closet.  To the east is a litter box which needs to be cleaned.  There is a day old brownie on the desk which smells of cat urine.  A book is open on the desk.

There are seventy four books on the desk about evolutionary theory.  A laptop is open on the desk.    

&gt; look laptop

There seems to be a dissertation chapter on the laptop.

I can relate with everything except your apparent love of the Mets.  Incidentally, I recently discovered that the BBC has released a free version of the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" text-based game on their website for that Infocom classic's 20th anniversary.  When I type "read book" or "grade essays" in the text-based game of my life, I often find myself there asking Ford, "What about my home?"

That was beyond funny.  That was one of the .0004%!o(MISSING)f things on the Net that actually is, as the kids say in their web-speak parlance, LOL funny.  Seriously, I was eating a sandwich, and I laughed and it kinda went down the wrong way and hurt my throat.

You bastard!  See if I pay my bill!

That was not only breathtakingly funny; it was also painfully familiar in more ways that I'd care to admit ...
