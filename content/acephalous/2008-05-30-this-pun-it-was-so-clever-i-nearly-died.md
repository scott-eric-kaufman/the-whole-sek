## This Pun, It Was So Clever, I Nearly Died

You should have read it.  Remarkable.  Think of the most clever pun you've ever read.  

Now multiply it by _numbers_.  

I imagine the author at work, staring at the blank screen, until suddenly, from nowhere, The Muse assaults him with an unthinking ferocity unknown outside legend and hyperbole.  Unblinking, he longs longingly at his creation, his only wish that he could experience its birth again.

The decision between slashes and parenthesis lingers in his loins.  He feels the tingle spread as he remembers how gently he unpressed his shift and brought that slash to life.  

On the brink!  It had been on the brink!  

For a moment the subtle curves of the parentheses had seduced him, but as he withdrew his pinkie he knew he had chosen wisely.  

In his loins.

He knew in his loins he had chosen wisely.  

Like countless dead dinosaurs compressed in a diamond, his pun condensed his brilliance into sharp translucence.  No one could encounter his pun and fail to acknowledge the awesomeness of the mind responsible for it.  

So he walked into the bathroom and beat off.

**THE END**

"0.001 is a number...."

But it's only one number. You have to multiply it by number_s_. As in, all of them.

Including zero. Which is why there is no pun. It is a times-zero pun.

Do you ever worry that the person who would hire you recognizes himself in your posts? If I wrote good puns, I'd be unnerved by this post.  I would fear that your presence in my department would make me feel inadequate, on account of my inadequate puns.  You don't use names, but you skewer most everyone in academia.  

(Do you have job? I feel like you said you did.  But I can't remember, for many reasons, reasons which are beer).

_0.001 is a number..._

As is -1!

_Do you ever worry that the person who would hire you recognizes himself in your posts?_

I doubt it.  I keep it so general that anyone, even the worst punster, would sympathize with the reader of the bad pun instead of the punter who took masturbatory glee in writing it.  That is to say, even if the person who inspired this post read it, they'd think it wasn't about them, but about someone else who wrote a pun they themselves gagged on.

Also, I came here as a Joycean, so I _love_ a good pun.  But as they say, when writing on the _Wake_, it's better to repeat one of Joyce's than trying to outdo him.

Forgot to address this:

_Do you have job?_

I have an adjunct position for next year, and will be hitting the market formally come December.

Shouldn't you be over at Kotsko's pestering Mr. ABD there? He was cruel to you when you were vulnerable, right?

The only problem is that I am never vulnerable.  It is impossible for SEK to repay me for my cruelty.

Only a beautiful woman could cause Kotsko to let down his guard. 

But one beautiful woman owed Kaufman a debt she felt she could never repay. Until, one day, Kaufman came to her with a strange request.

Maybe it's more of a challenge for literary writers: The only time I intentionally made a pun in a formal paper was my very first graduate seminar paper. It was _awful_, but I thought it clever; fortunately, only I and my advisor ever read it. 

I can't remember, offhand, any examples of significant punning in the published work I've read over the last few years, either. It's just not _done_.

(note: I love puns, and it's a fondness my family and spouse shares, much to my mother-in-law's dismay. I just wouldn't _publish_ one)
