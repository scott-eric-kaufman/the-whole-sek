A strange phrase?  Indeed.  Stranger still would be the variation Charles Darwin surely adopted after this unfortunate entomological expedition:
One day on tearing off some old bark, I saw two rare beetles and seized one in each hand; then I saw a third and new kind, which I could not bear to lose, so that I popped the one that I held in my right hand into my mouth.  Alas it ejected some intensely acrid fluid, which burnt my tongue so that I was forced to spit the beetle out, which was lost, as with the third one.

Sometimes this Darwin fellow's diary is 14 karat comic gold.  Had I the time, I'd transcribe the long entries on the _Tritonia arborescens_ or "talking snail," one of the only molluscs able to produce sounds audible to the human ear.  But I've still a week's worth of reading/writing/business ahead of me...
