## This “it” may be the “that” that’s so far up with which it can’t be put.

I confess that it’s Week Ten in the UC system, and as such, I’m swamped with the duties that make me a responsible teacher.  But as [a cancer survivor](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/unbelievable-th.html) myself, I can’t let this pass. In his post about her dying words, Donald Douglas [writes](http://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2010/12/elizabeth-edwards-parting-statement.html):

> The story’s trending at [Memeorandum](http://www.memeorandum.com/101206/p128#a101206p128). And at ABC News, “[Elizabeth Edwards Won’t Receive Anymore Cancer Treatment: John Edwards’ Joins Family at His Wife’s Side](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/elizabeth-edwards-cancer-worsens-treatment-stopped/story?id=12326890).” But I notice at [her farewell statement](http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/eliizabeth-edwards-declining-further-cancer-treatment-20101206) an odd aspect to her “three saving graces”: She doesn’t list faith in God as one of them[.]

I repeat: the first words Donald Douglas writes about the death of a mother of three is, and I quote, “[t]he story’s trending.”

I repeat: “[t]he story’s trending.”

That’s what death is to him: an opportunity to capitalize, via traffic, from the death of a political opponent.  That Donald Douglas doesn’t even go through the motions – can’t even fathom that her acceptance of her fate was hers own, and accomplished with dignity, says something more terrible about Donald Douglas than anything I could write.  Donald Douglas should stick to posting nude images of women the same age as his students.  Better yet, while Donald Douglas publishes nude images of women the same age as his students, he should think about [why I had insomnia last night](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2010/12/why-i-have-insomnia.html):

> There’s a word for your face, for the teeth you have left, and that word is danger, grave danger, because that word is “fear,” but it sounds like “snap,” because that word is “pain,” and it whistles, up through the lungs it’s got left, “What happened to my teeth?  My teeth.  What happened — to my — tee-th.”  Court it within shot of my ears – _my ears_– again, and the word whispered will be “death.”  Two syllables, you see, not one, but two: “Death.”  But not – _not_– before “pain.”  Never before “pain.”

Would that we had a Pembleton — a righteously unhypocritical Christian who-knows-better-but-still is of the sort seen 1:05 seconds into [this clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0\_VBVXuyCM&feature=related) — instead of the likes of Donald Douglas, who believes his Christian duty is to talk “trending” about the recently departed and post to nude images of women the same age as his students.

And he's an ignorant twit, besides, with no theological sense. He cites her two books on spirituality and hope, then says "Having not read them, I can't say what it is --- spiritual or otherwise --- that animates her sense of grace, but it's not God." Read that again.

He comes to this conclusion, apparently, through several statements she made in public including rejecting the efficacy of intercessory prayer and emphasizing a focus on the rightness of our actions over a "let's not piss off god" fear-driven morality. I'm paraphrasing, of course. 

None of this in any way conflicts the possibility, and may well increase the probability in my opinion, that Elizabeth Edwards, of blessed memory, believed in God, in Christ, and in _the core Protestant tenets_ of salvation through _the grace of God_ by faith rather than through works. In other words, she was an entirely mainstream believing Christian who just didn't believe in magical prayer fairy dust to solve problems.

His inhumanity drove my links _literally blue in the face_.  That's all I'm going to say.

Douglas is clearly an asshole and, despite his existence in some corner of the academy, not worth paying attention to.  Anyone who thinks that it is appropriate to judge the faith of someone else at the moment of their death is beyond tacky.  My monotheist friends keep telling me that that sort of thing is reserved for God, but apparently Douglas disagrees.

To Ahistoricality's point, however, I think Elizabeth Edwards was pretty clear in her [public statements](http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the\_original\_theology\_of\_elizabeth\_edwards) that, while she still saw herself as a Christian and belonged to a Methodist church, she did not see her faith as a _mainstream_ Christian one.  She came to her faith in a non-intercessory god in part based on childhood exposure to Buddhism, and in part based on her reflection on the death of her son.  The sort of God that could have saved him but chose not to was not one she felt she could worship or believe in.

I think that it's too her credit, and part of a larger legacy of maintaining her integrity in the face of public pressures and not allowing herself to be made a shallow political performer that she resisted the urge to simplify her faith and keep her doubt and deviations to herself.  That some religiuos bigots think otherwise just says something unfortunate about them.

Come on guys, Douglas has done a real service here; through his idiocy, his utter lack of compassion, he's led to you guys discussing Elizabeth's Edwards faith, and to me thinking that her faith is the type I have real respect for, and value in this world.

JPool, I will defer entirely to your understanding of Edward's theological background, as it's a topic I've never had any interest in before; I was just riffing on DD's incoherence. You're right about her dignified public role in that regard, absolutely.

That said, I don't understand - being Jewish is part of it, I guess - why a non-intercessory God wouldn't be considered a mainstream Protestant belief. Perhaps it's my historian's originalism: the whole point of Protestantism was getting away from an instrumental view of prayer and virtue.

Did you see that the Westboro crowd are showing up now as well?

Maybe they can work together?

I wasn't raised Christian, and I also can't speak to the historical views of the early Protestants, but my understanding is that contemporary Protestants broadly see their approach to prayer differing from Catholicism in being exclusively direct prayer to God/Jesus rather than including prayer to intermediaries like saints or the Virgin Mary.  Certainly Protstantism could have developed a non-intercessory vision of God (Deism's God the watch maker or some sort of refinement of Calvism in which God preordains everything and so couldn't do anything except what they were already going to do after that), but that never caught on.  While some individuals and theologians disagree, my sense is the broad Protestant consensus is that God answers prayers, and that suggesting that God doesn't is stepping out on a far limb.

Elizabth Edward knew it was time for her to die.  She fought a strong fight and then found peace.  While all this was happening her husband dishonored her by having a child with another woman and Elizabeth handled this as well. She already knew God does not always do what we want Him to do.  She knew she would now join her son and hoped for calm in her leaving 3 children behind.  I am sure she found what she was looking for in the end.  Mothers fight harder to live when they have young children.  I have seen this many times.  Problems in other parts of their life become meaningless.  The power within them is reserved for their children and to say she had loset or had no faith in God is far from the truth.  As adults we believe God can't give us things.  We have free will and can go in one direction or another without God saying "Do this".  It makes no difference what we believe, we just hope there is a place to go to when we leave here.  She died with grace and that is what we will remember most.  We will not remember someone was an ass and should get his punishment for being one.
