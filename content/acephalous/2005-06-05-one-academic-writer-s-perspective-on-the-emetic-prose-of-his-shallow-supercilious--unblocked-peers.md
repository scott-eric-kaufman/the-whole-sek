## One Academic Writer's Perspective on the Emetic Prose of his Shallow, Supercilious & Unblocked Peers

I’m a terrible writer.  But you?  You write and
write and write, blithely unaware that every word you put to paper is
further evidence of your awesome incompetence.  There you sit, a
marvel of scholarly productivity, oblivious to the effect the
evacuations of your incontinent mind will have upon your
audience.  You write.  Your complex palaver about the
problems you’ve invented to identify and solve concerns you
alone.  You write.  You entertain fancies of your imminent
importance when you think no one’s around: royalty checks in
whole dollars; a permanent place on trendy syllabi; a course-packet
apotheosis.  

You write.  

I hate you.  

Still you write.

You should see reflected in your words those of Ambrose Beirce: 

Self-esteem, _n._ An erroneous appraisement.

No doubt your inattention to the matter of your audience will have no
effect on the acceptance of your ideas.  But what if you _did_
pay attention to your audience.  What would you produce
then?  A readable book, a potential best-seller like Mark
McGurl’s [_The Novel Art_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0691088993/qid=1118019964/sr=8-2/ref=sr\_8\_xs\_ap\_i2\_xgl14/102-9607103-5071311?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) or Tom Lutz’s [_American Nervousness: 1903_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0801499011/qid=1118020057/sr=8-1/ref=sr\_8\_xs\_ap\_i1\_xgl14/102-9607103-5071311?v=glance&s=books&n=507846)? 
Do you think the quality of your prose alters your readers’
experience of it?  Whose prose do you emulate?  To whom do
you turn when you want to steal _that_ turn of phrase?  One of those literary types you’re always yammerin’ on about?  Another scholar?  

Because you really need help.

You’re a terrible writer.

It sounds as if someone needs a montage. (Even Rocky had a montage.)  Just show a lot of things happening at once; remind everyone of what's going on. And with every post, show a little improvement, to show that it won't take too long.

It's called a montage. Get one.

I knew I married you for some reason, Little Womedievalist.  It's not everyday you find someone who can both recognize that someone needs a montage and is capable of producing one.  Get to it!  If you'd like, I can make you a training montage about your making me a training montage...
