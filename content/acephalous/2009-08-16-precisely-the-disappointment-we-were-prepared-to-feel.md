All the noise from the right about Obama being a
not-so-crypto-socialist or communist or Marxist has had its desired
effect: Obama now seems willing to drop [the public option](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/08/16/democratic-senator-public-health-insurance-option-dead/)
from his health care reform package. But everyone who always saw Obama
for what he is—a dogged centrist who knows how to game the
system—already knew that the public option would likely be off the
table during the initial rounds of reform. Thoughtful folks knews that
Obama would play politics—that he would float a plan far more ambitious
than he could push through Congress—that his concessions would be
scripted from the start, consisting of provisions that he knew to be
untenable in the present political climate but which, after becoming
familiar through repetition, would sound less extreme the next time
they became fodder for public discussion.

Such are the dictates of his technocratic fancy.

What makes the conservative response to his policies particularly
dumbfounding is that he’s flashed his incrementalist credentials
numerous times—most saliently in his treatment of the GLBT issues—and
yet conservatives respond like he’s always playing for the whole pot
when, in fact, all his talk of high stakes is intended to distract them
from the fact that he’s penny-anteing them into poorhouse. In short,
conservatives are giddy because they’ve “prevented” him from winning as
big as he talks _even though he’s the only one leaving the table with anything in his wallet._ 

Tempted as I am to expand on all the apt metaphors here—deaths
accomplished by a thousand cuts that produce ghosts who proudly crow
about not being beheaded, or defeated generals bragging about
transitory victories in a long war—but as conservatives have provided
me (and Obama) with better material, I can cut to the chase. Consider
what the conservative movement currently considers a win:

		

					[]()
			

1.  Conservatives lie about the existence of “death panels.”
2.  Liberals cave to public outcry and eliminate “death panels” _that never existed_ from an inchoate version of the Senate’s health care reform package.
3.  Conservatives [declare victory](http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous\_conservative/2009/08/2009-palin-1-obama-0.html).

I remember playing similar games as a child. I would:

1.  Pretend there were Imperial Storm Troopers in my closet, who I would
2.   Defeat by dint of Force and flashlight, before
3.   Declaring victory over the gathering forces of darkness.

The difference being, of course, that because there were no actual
Storm Troopers in my closet, my imaginary victory entailed nobody
else’s actual defeat; whereas those who boast of victory over imaginary
“death panels” have, in fact, suffered both tactical and rhetorical
losses. Any provision short of a “death panel” that crops up in future
iterations of health care reform will fail to rouse the ire of the
conservative base to the boil it’s at now.  They have, in short,
diminished the rhetorical effectiveness of future complaints. Sarah
Palin has allowed conservatives to feel the thrill of victory amid
their agonizing defeat, and they love her for it.

I anticipate the response to this post from those to my right will
be that I’m reading Obama’s mind—that I can’t possibly know what
concessions he would or wouldn’t have made had it not been for the
conservative opposition. Fair enough, I would say, were it not for the
fact that I know something they don’t—a truth that the collective
oedipalizing of their eyes with stakes named Ayers and Stalin has
blinded them to—and that is, simply, that Obama is a centrist; that his
entire career is accurately characterized as being centrist; that even
his published utopian yearnings show that this is a man who _dreams centrist dreams right down the middle_. This is because I recognize that the center is the equivalent to zero on a number line that looks like this:

[![politicalspectrum](http://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/politicalspectrum1.jpg?w=300&h=300 "politicalspectrum")](http://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/politicalspectrum1.jpg)

So how do I know Obama’s a centrist? Because I’m dialed up to eleven and annoyed by what I can’t hear.

Don't you think that politically sophisticated conservatives are playing their own games, though?  Whatever they say in public to keep the rubes running, it seems like their real objective is to keep pushing back against the center by keeping the yokels scared and angry.  They know Obama will never push anything more than incremental change, but why allow even that much?  He already plans on having to fight for every inch, so why not make him understand what it really means to fight for every inch against the Republican machine?  All they really have to do is play for time and run out the clock.

By the way, Scott, your decision to ignore the news cycle means that you're now [ahead](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/08/staying-step-ahead) of it, instead of behind it.

Thanks, Ahistoricality.  I'm almost already feeling the unmitigated joy I'll feel in full when the conservative base forces conservative lawmakers to remove a provision they themselves inserted into the bill.

CP:

_Don't you think that politically sophisticated conservatives are playing their own games, though?_ 

As per [this](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/08/the-new-stupid-passes-it-on.html), not to mention the Ahistoricality's link above, I don't think there are politically sophisticated running the show right now.  They're taking cues from Sarah Palin, after all.

_They know Obama will never push anything more than incremental change, but why allow even that much? He already plans on having to fight for every inch, so why not make him understand what it really means to fight for every inch against the Republican machine? All they really have to do is play for time and run out the clock._

Thing is, they can't run out the clock---they lack the votes to do so.  All they can do is point at the midterm elections and hope and pray that Obama hasn't made too much progress by then.  But, of course, he will have, even if it's merely incremental.

I hope you're right.  At the moment, I'm cautiously optimistic, based on the beliefs that 1) Obama is brighter and more politically astute than me and seems to be pretty confident, and 2)  Obama is genuinely committed to reform.  The former statement is undoubtedly true.  I don't think Obama has done anything to legitimately cast doubt on the latter.  You have to assume he has a better idea than anyone what he's up against and that he thinks he can come out on top.

I just tend to get nervous watching and reading the media coverage and remembering back to the failures of the Clinton administration.  I'm not sure the GOP needs to run out the clock on Obama--they may just need to run out the clock on the attention span of the citizens who currently, casually, support reform.  If public support for reform falters, if too many of the votes Obama ought to have on paper in Congress are too deep in industry pockets, and if the soi disant liberal media opinion makers run and hide again the way they did time and again in the 90s, I'm afraid healthcare reform could easily do the collapse.

It seems to me that you're comparing the republican elites to the boy who cried wolf.  The republican elites cry wolf regarding health care reform, their base brings heavy weaponry to town hall meetings, incremental reform nonetheless happens (let's say).  So next time Obama wants to do something, the republican elites cry wolf again.  The Aesop version of the story is that the republican base is less likely to bring out the assault rifles the second time.  This seems to depend on an assumption of a kind of reasonableness on the part of the base.  An alternative ending is that the villagers to whom the boy repeatedly cries wolf start to really enjoy running around looking for non-existent wolves (or, in this case, bringing assault rifles to political meetings).

I'll surrender to that temptation: At least Alonso Quixano tilted at windmills.
