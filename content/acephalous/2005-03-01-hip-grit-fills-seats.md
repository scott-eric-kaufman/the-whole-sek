## Hip Grit Fills Seats

I'm currently considering responding to an email I got that announces a book signing by Denise Uyehara, who according to this email is "a pioneering performance artist, one of the first to explore Asian American queer subjectivity through performance."  The post, destined to be satirical in nature, would mainly be about how ineffective academic advertising is, how closely it resembles parodies of itself.  For instance, Uyehara's website bills a previous show, "Hello (Sex) Kitty: Mad Asian Bitch on Wheels"--which I'm sure really has, in the words of the Metro's karaoke-loving music editor Todd Inoue, "enough hip grit to attract fans of poetry slammers" to make "sensitive people of all colors...shi(f)t in their seats"--as one that "excites all the genders to laugh, talk and respect each other."  That sort of hip grit won't fill up the shi(f)t-filled seats of any auditorium...  

So, you ask, why wouldn't I consider posting something about Uyehara?  The answer is obvious: I don't want people thinking I'm a homophobe.  I've already got Some Gay Guy responding to what I write...

...but the real issue is--as Mrs.  Acephalous mentioned to me this morning-- why all the  film screenings  and performances  mass-mailed to various departmental listservs are about queer subjectivity in one form or another.  Not that I mind queer subjectivity.  In fact, I have 150 lbs. of queer subjectivity on my couch most every Saturday night.
