## Shorter Ann Althouse: Racists can't be racist because they <em>love</em> their racism.

So some of Scott Brown's staffers were caught [tomahawk-chopping while war-whooping](http://www.wcvb.com/news/politics/Sen-Scott-Brown-staffers-caught-on-video-chanting-Indian-war-whoops-making-tomahawk-chops/-/9848766/16727976/-/tj3yi5z/-/index.html),
 which is absolutely not a traditional means of representing Native 
Americans as tomahawk-chopping, war-whooping, nothing-noble-about-them 
savages. There's no history of American cinema in which Native Americans
 were a violent bulwark against the tide of civilizing white men eager 
to manifest their destiny. There's no history of American literature in 
which Native Americans played the roles of "Captor #1" and "Captor #2" 
and let's just call them "Tribe of Captors" in [popular captivity narratives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captivity\_narrative) that identified war-whooping with lady-taking and child-killing. None of that is real because [Ann Althouse said so](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2012/09/did-scott-brown-staffers-make-anti.html):

Someone [doing the "tomahawk chop" is himself playing the role](http://www.talkingchop.com/2012/4/30/2990244/how-the-atlanta-braves-adopted-the-tomahawk-chop-from-the-florida-state-seminoles)
 of Indian. This Indian character making a stereotypical gesture can't  
be read as expressing hostility toward Indians. The Indian is his hero.

See? "The Indian is his hero." Whose hero exactly? According to Althouse _anyone doing the tomahawk chop_.
 Which means that she believes that performing a racially offensive 
can't be considered racist because the performance itself is necessarily
 an act of loving emulation. For example, if one of Scott Brown's white 
staffers were [to create a television show called](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/01/american-born-chinese-lecture-notes.html)

[![everyone ruvs chin-kee](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/everyone-ruvs-chin-kee.jpg "everyone ruvs chin-kee")](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/everyone-ruvs-chin-kee.jpg)

It couldn't be considered racist _by definition_ because its 
use of the stereotypical Chinese immigrant is evidence of that this 
white staffer considers Chin-Kee to be "his hero." In all seriousness, 
Althouse's problem is that she's so ignorant that she doesn't realize 
that the stereotype of Native Americans that Brown's staffers invoke 
isn't historically accurate, which is why she can claim, straight-faced,
 that "these fake Indians, the staffers, are pretending to be real 
Indians," when in actuality _they're pretending to be racist stereotypes of Native Americans_.

One day I will wake up in a world in which "Ann Althouse" is revealed
 to be the work of an art collective trying to win a place in the _Guinness Book of World Records_ for the Longest Sustained  Installation of  a Person Who Couldn't Possibly Exist. I pray that day comes soon.

In the meantime [go read my other post](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/game-of-thrones-winter-is-coming-for-catelyn-and-jon-snow). It'll cleanse this stupid clear off your palate.

I'm still praying for the following to go away or dissapear from the different media outlets: Sarah Palin and her entire brood, Michelle Bachman, Rick Santorum, All the Pastors that teach Prosperity theology, Rush Limbaugh ( I don't know who has been in my prayers the longest Rush or Pat Robinson). Do not fret will add this one to the list.
