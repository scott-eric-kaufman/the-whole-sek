			Rob Farley might not have been [born to burgle](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2010/02/does-to-rob-require-some-kind-of.html), but perhaps what we study influences what endowed chair we earn. Consider the curious case of [Dr. Ed Diener](http://diener.socialpsychology.org/):  
Professor
Diener is listed as one of the most highly cited psychologists by the
Institute of Scientific Information, with over 12,000 citations to his
credit ... [His] research focuses on the measurement of well-being;
temperament and personality influences on well-being; theories of
well-being; income and well-being; and cultural influences on
well-being. He has edited three recent books on subjective well-being,
and a 2005 book on multi-method measurement in psychology. _Diener is currently writing a popular book on happiness_ ...What endowed chair does this expert in psychological metrics of happiness hold?  
Ed Diener is the Joseph R. Smiley Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the University of Illinois._Of course_ he is.\*   

\*I'm
sure this joke has been beaten into the ground in the circles in which
Diener runs, but those circles are neither these circles nor my circles.
