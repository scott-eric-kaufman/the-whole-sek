## The Best Science Book Ever Written...

[_That's odd.  I x-posted what I wrote on the Valve yesterday, but it didn't stick.  Now it will.  Be sure to read [the comments](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/the\_best\_science\_book\_ever\_written/#comments) over there, as they're already quite substantial._]

...is _a novel_?

[Jonah Lehrer](http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2006/10/and\_the\_best\_science\_book\_ever.php) links to [_The Guardian_‘s account](http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,1927916,00.html) of the Royal Institution of London’s crowning Primo Levi’s [_The Periodic Table_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805210415/diesekoschmar-20)
“The Best Scientific Book Ever Written.” Not that Levi’s
quasi-modernist memoir doesn’t deserve acclaim.  Every chapter’s
prefixed by an element which plays some crucial part in the plot or
symbolizes—like Linati’s [Joycean kidney](http://www.robotwisdom.com/jaj/ulysses/schemata.html#4),
with all its attendant frustrations—some moment of personal, cultural
or historical of import.  It’s brilliantly executed—but its brilliance
lies in Levi’s deft imbrication of the scientific and the personal, the
personal and the historical, the scientific and the historical,
&c.  _The Periodic Table_ is not a scientific work with
literary merit, but a literary work informed, to take one example, by
practical applications of modern chemistry.  I wouldn’t complain,
except that books like Levi’s receive lay-praise daily.  More worthy of
celebration is the rare scientific book able to _move_ a public forever on the brink of scientific illiteracy.  

I don’t want to rehearse the thesis of Gillian Beer’s [_Darwin’s Plots_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521783925/diesekoschmar-20) here, but the Royal Institution’s inclusion of Charles Darwin’s [_The Voyage of the Beagle_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0792265599/diesekoschmar-20) over [_On The Origin of Species_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393061345/diesekoschmar-20) on the shortlist demands it.\*  _The Voyage of the Beagle_ is an important but _utterly conventional_ document in literary and scientific history.  It lacks _The Origin_‘s novelistic flair.

Beers:

The sense that everything is connected, though the
connections may be obscured, gave urgency to the enterprise of
uncovering such connections.  This was the form of plotting crucial to
Dickens’s work, as we can see, for example, in _Bleak House_,
where the fifty-six named—and many more unnamed—characters all turn out
to be related by way either of concealed descent (Esther and Lady
Deadlock) or of economic dependency ("The dependency of one organic
being on another, as of a parasite on its prey, lies generally between
beings remote in scale of nature") .... As [_Bleak House_]
proceeds the immense assemblage of apparently contingent characters is
ordered and reordered into multiple sets of relations so that we
discover that all of them are interdependent.  What at first looks like
agglomeration proves to be analysable connection.

The unruly superfluity of Darwin’s material at first gives an
impression of superfecundity without design.  Only gradually and
retrospectively does the force of the argument emerge from the
profusion of example. (42)

Darwin accomplished in _The Origin_ what the popular explication of Pinker’s [_The Blank Slate_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142003344/diesekoschmar-20) doesn’t even attempt: namely, to explain a scientific concept _in all its complexity_ to a world which mostly only understood novels.  Richard Dawkins’ [_The Selfish Gene_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199291152/diesekoschmar-20) actually moves in the _opposite_ direction—it is most powerful when Dawkins oversimplifies, _e.g._ when he reduces lived complexity into “memes.”  (The Dawkins and Pinker books were also shortlisted.)  

I suppose my bias shows here, but I think Darwin’s literary-scientific achievement in _The Origin_ towers over the solid work of popularization, _The Voyage_ included.

_I suppose my bias shows here, but I think Darwin’s literary-scientific achievement in The Origin towers over the solid work of popularization, The Voyage included._

As a working scientist, I must say that you are spot on - both here and in your leading remarks.  The Origin is unique in being a work of ground-breaking science as well as an exposition that can be grasped by the intelligent non-specialist.  Nothing comes close in the 20th century.

That said, I can suggest two books that lay out the gist of modern science without being offensive to the literate eye.  My favorite is 'The Einstein Theory of Gravity' by Lieber and Lieber, my other favorite is "Lectures on Physics" by Feynmann.  Each is an accessible description of the field by an active researcher.

    Legitimate theory, Theo

(and stop spying on me!)
