## Hello?  Is There Anybody In There?

No.  

However I _did_ post something relatively substantial [elsewhere](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/how\_novels\_think\_why\_critics\_cant\_an\_exercise\_in\_navel\_gazing/) this evening.  Check it out if you're at all interested in evolutionary minutiae.  

If you're not 1) I don't know why you read my blog and 2) you may be interested in [this artifact](http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/clarkes2006.htm) recovered from the depths of Gmail's spam folder. 

Yes, that is Adam's review of the Clarke shortlist.  According to his email, he "thought [he] was being all soft and cuddly," whereas everyone else thought he was being "Nasty . . . And not in a Christina Agulera way."  (He's already confessed his eternal shame at not being able to spell Her Holiness' name.  However, I suspect that's _the very error_ which relegated him to the spam folder in the first place.)  

I'll respond to the exceptional comments I've received on yesterday's post tomorrow.  I'd respond tonight, but after a day of grading and a night of revising half of an essay I wrote weeks ago and am _still_ incredibly unsatisfied with, I fear I'd catch some of [the grumpiness going around](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/i\_quite\_literally\_woke\_up\_one\_morning\_and\_decided\_to\_write\_a\_thriller/).

[W](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail.html).  

[EDIT: That _was_ a typepad artifact.  Now it's something _awesome_ instead.  When you save a draft of a post, the cursor's always in the "post continuation" window instead of the "post introduction" window.  I don't know why it does that.  But we can pretend the "W" is more meaningful.  See!]

"W"?

Relegate me to the Guantanamo Bay of your spam dump, would you?  I see ... _I_ see ...

Plus grumpiness on the _Valve_.  What is the world coming to?

Adam, your review is another example of the recent Acephalsou focus on unpleasant truths revealed -- like the idea that a gaffe is defined as an occasion when a politician accidentally tells the truth. Something that starts with "surely we can hope, surely expect, to encounter newness in SF?" can be guaranteed to draw horrified denial from fans.  No one is allowed to question whether every new SF novel is, in fact, [new](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/03/irrational\_inso.html#comment-15080838).

I have to say that the list looks especially tiresome to me.  Is this really the best the UK is producing these days?  \*My\* small part of the world, i.e. western Massachusetts, produced two interesting fantasies or sort-of-fantasies in 2005 -- fantasies not being under any obligation to be new, they can be "interesting" while still being complete pastiches of existing source material -- John Crowley's \_Lord Byron's Novel\_ and Paul Park's \_A Princess of Roumania\_.

Roumania?  I am still struggling to get through it.  Half way and holding.

The premise is kind of interesting, the execution less so.  Actually, the writing is pretty good.  It is the whole "two story line" thing that makes it a frustrating read.  That, and the characters have just a little too much cardboard in their makeup.

Jake, but the whole novel is \*about\* cardboard, in a sense.  I mean 

(spoilers for the early part of the book that you've already read)

premise 1 is that our entire world is fictional, and fairly soon it goes up in smoke when the only copies of the book holding it are burned.  By the end of the book (and I don't think this is quite a spoiler because it's an interpretation) I think that it becomes apparent that the protagonist has been fictionalized or virtualized in some manner.  It's bog-standard adolescent girl fantasy filtered through Borges.  As such it's a bit more postmodern and mannered than I like -- it has all the problems that, say, poetry about poetry has -- but it's still interesting in a way that I would guess that many of the books that Adam reviewed are not.

I hope you're having a blast grading.  I've been wondering who's grading my work this time around...

The quarter is over, and after all the studying and hard work, there is this sort of anti-climactic feel to it.  Maybe it's because no one had sex in your office this time around.

Okay, Scott. What's up with all the in-title references to the music I listened to in high school?
