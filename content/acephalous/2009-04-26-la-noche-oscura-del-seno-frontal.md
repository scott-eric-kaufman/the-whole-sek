Sorry for suddenly disappearing on you.  Around 1 p.m. on Friday they began ripping up the parking lot next to my apartment.  By 3 p.m. a headache the likes of which I've never experienced kicked in.  

I've had sinus headaches my entire adult life.  This was no sinus headache.  

This was an [ice-cream headache](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain\_freeze) that lasted for two straight days and which lingers still (only now the _homunculus_ wields a dull thrombotic hammer instead of the chisel he first favored).  

Not much in the way of thinking has happened this weekend.  Many terrible films have been watched.  Will resume normal internet activities as soon as I can stare at the screen for more than a minute at a time without—

Alas, an ice cream headache without even any ice cream! I hope you recover soon. 

PS have you got summer work, or are you working on Teh Booook? (either book, any book.) Or are you going on vacay like some of my friends, lucky bastards?

I'm sorry for your ordeal Scott - but thinking about ice cream headaches prompted me to dig up the most pertinent episode of the [Most Bestest Show of Our Adolescence](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2900641817312954076).

of course it's hard for you to see the episode of which I speak after the html is stripped out - so here's the link:

People have asked you the standard "let's just be sure this isn't menigitis" questions, right?

_Alas, an ice cream headache without even any ice cream! I hope you recover soon._ 

And, of course, you know what provided the most relief?  _An ice pack_.  The world is cruel sometimes.

_have you got summer work, or are you working on Teh Booook? (either book, any book.) Or are you going on vacay like some of my friends, lucky bastards?_

No summer work, but maybe a brief vacation.  (It's Meg and I's tenth anniversary, so we're going to try to do something special.)  I'll be working on 1) one of the two essays I've sent out that people will want me to revise-and-resubmit, 2) the visual rhetoric textbook, 3) turning my dissertation into a book.  As for why I won't be working this summer, it's because---keep this quiet for now---UCI wants to take me on full-time next year, which means a salary north of $60K that begins paying at the beginning of the next fiscal year, which is in June.  Yes, still an adjunct position, but a sweet adjunct working for people I like (my co-author on the textbook) in a program I've helped shape . . . which means I'll also have lots of time to work on the portfolio for next year's job search.  

_I'm sorry for your ordeal Scott - but thinking about ice cream headaches prompted me to dig up the most pertinent episode of the Most Bestest Show of Our Adolescence._

I write in the hope that my ordeals bring others joy.  (In this case, it brought me some too.  Man, the '90s were an odd time.  Where's the internet?  What?  Not there yet?)

_People have asked you the standard "let's just be sure this isn't menigitis" questions, right?_

I actually told my doctor, who had a _House_ shirt under his scrubs, that I was pretty sure it was lupus.  He looked at me cock-eyed and then I pointed at his shirt.  The ER is a strange and unwonderful place.  I'll turn my little ordeal into a funny story as soon as the hammering _homunculus_ relinquishes its hold on my sense of humor.  

_Or Porcine Influenza? That would suck._

I am in Southern California, and I did spend many, many hours in the company of many, many Mexicans this weekend, so you never know.
