What else can be said of someone who invested an entire week writing about the future of electronic publication because he thought this [panel](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/cfp\_literary\_studies\_and\_electronic\_publishing\_stuff/) was at the end of the week when, in fact, this [one](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/07/american-litera.html) is?

Other possible answers: 
"Get to work."  

"Change hotel reservations."  

"I call it: _The Calendar_."

"Stop crying already."

"Get to work."

"I'm not kidding around here.  _Get to work_."

Oh no! At least the next one's done, right? Deadlines are sometimes good things. 

You've already written the immediate one, right? You just need to cut it down to presentation size? I hope? 

Man, good luck and pass the No Doze.

You devoted an entire week to a 2-4 page panel paper?  On a topic about which you've already written vast amounts?

That had better be a fucking awesome 2-4 page paper.

Adam, I spend between six and seven hours daily on the dissertation, and pencil in an hour or two to work on the talks.  So I haven't been working _straight_ through on it, but all of the time I've allotted myself to ... which means I'm going to have to allot myself more to finish the London paper by Friday.

Yes, Sisyphus, No Doze, a more-than-decent suggestion.

CR, what can I say?  It's a line on my CV, and one that'll show people that I'm -- how do you say it -- open to multiple approaches?  I mean, I'm not likely to be applying to Research 1 institutions, so this kind of flexibility will do me some good.  Plus, have you seen my panel?  Scott McLemee and Bob Stein are worth price of admission alone.

No comment. Seriously. No comment.

WTF? Why not? Are you crazy? 

_Plus, have you seen my panel? Scott McLemee and Bob Stein are worth price of admission alone._

Yuck? What yuck? I don't know this conference. Is it going to be populated by Mark Bauerlein and the people who've been commenting on Durham In Wonderland thread? 

The first hit I get on google is The Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC) ---- CR, you have something against children? And libraries?

Oh my god. I'm laughing hard enough to spill my wine. "Extreme forms of feminist criticism"? Evidently, by the next paragraph (this is from "A Short History of the ALSC") they constitute a silent majority, trampled by the  hordes of politically-correct critics who want nothing more than to aggressively revise the canon and tar-and-feather the last few practitioners of New Criticism. 

Snicker.

It's funny how that whole history reads like a reverse-communist organization, complete with agitating for change from within. There's also a weird mix of heroizing the participants (emails are written and sent exuberantly! From across the nation scholars travel to the conservative mecca of Irvine (eh???)), and I love the whole bit at the end, with a we-need-money-but-cant-be-_political_, luckily this conservative foundation just conveniently is willing to fund us a big chunk of cash.

I wonder how many of the "promising young scholars" agree with their credo and agenda, and how many are casting about for someplace, anyplace, to present their work and lengthen their CV as the job and tenure requirements (ignored by the ALSC) quietly ratchet up.

Sisyphus, 

I think you came around too late to know about this, but this ALSC type back and forth was actually how Scott and I first met. (Short version: Teh Valve is a ALSC front, the ALSC is a Scaife foundation front, etc...) Which is both true and not. It depends what "front" means to you. And it depends how much you think it matters where your money comes from. 

So it's half tongue-in-cheek, since the argument has such a long and tired history, and SEK knows it. But no, I'd definitely never go to the conference.

_It's funny how that whole history reads like a reverse-communist organization, complete with agitating for change from within. There's also a weird mix of heroizing the participants_

I think that's called, if I'm not wrong, the neo-conservative ethos. And or Horowitzism. (Horowitzerasty?) 

BTW, you got my email right? Not to be pushy or anything.

People should also know that the ALSC also sponsors The Valve.  I believe that this involves some kind of financial support with web hosting.

CR and I argued, right at the beginning of the Valve, over whether ALSC's sinister right-wing connections meant that the Valve was a tool of the right or not.  I agreed that they had sinister right-wing connections, but wrote that Holbo's known history meant that he wasn't a tool and that they weren't going to get anything for their money.  Given that Bauerlein has since left the Valve -- who knows why, but I'd guess it's because of a distinct lack of culture war, and because Valve commenters pretty universally attacked him whenever he bothered to post about anything -- I'd say I was right.

Yeah, the Valve doesn't seem to be a noxious right wing front. And I'm sure that the ALSC has melted into a wishy-washy place for John to give is One Laptop Novel Per Child stump. But I still wouldn't go. For one thing, and I might be wrong, I picture it filled up with people who look like the sorts that you see on guerilla videos of Young Republican meetups in DC. (Present company excepted, of course. I guess.) 

But I still wouldn't ever go. Having an allegiance to the MLA is probably like being a member of a social democratic party that oscillated between unworkable utopianism and utter thirdway selloutism. I drives you nuts, but you'd feel guilty if you weren't trying to, as it were, change the party from within.

Wow. I'd never thought to wonder what the ALSC is. Funny thing, I went to their site, searched 'medieval,' and turned up a session in 2002 with Lee Patterson. Patterson's a Marxist critic, hence (I presume) hardly a conservative, but he and the Valve (and I guess the ALSC)--if I can gesture wildly here--have in common a deepseated hostility to psychoanalytic criticism. 

(would it be fair to say that the odd origins of the Valve have something to do with the paucity of women among its "current authors"?)

CR: nice description of the MLA. Plug in 'democratic party' for even more despair.

Huh...that 2002 conference program is fascinating. For such a short program, it swings wildly between an uncommonly high number of literary  mikados (Patterson, Guiseppe Mazotta, probably others) and a grab bag of grad students and independent scholars. The 'conservative' bias is probably apparent in the session titles: nothing poco (closest we get is 'Foreign Lit in Translation'), nothing theoretical, almost all 'great books.' Perhaps it's also apparent in the inclusion of Francine Prose, whose repulsive _Blue Angel_ perhaps would have gone down nicely with some of the D-i-W commenters (btw, Rich: did you see that Ralph Luker is getting beat up by Frontpage hoodlums? Politics and strange bedfellows)...all very interesting.

Karl, I already tried my best to annoy Ralph to his senses.  If the body shot of "Ralph marched with dead heroes, with MLK / Who cares what they'd think if they saw him today? / When there's protests bout racism, white moderates wail / Who reads 'Letter From Birmingham Jail'?" had no effect, then there's nothing I can do.

CR: "Yeah, the Valve doesn't seem to be a noxious right wing front. And I'm sure that the ALSC has melted into a wishy-washy place for John to give is One Laptop Novel Per Child stump. "

Agree with the first, not necessarily the second.  (I don't really see how one could characterize the Valve as anything but moderately left-liberal, politically.  Although of course some people have deep objections to that, it's not the same as it being right wing.)  I'd guess that some elements, including of necessity some of the leading elements, of ALSC are fully Scaifed up.

I don't know much of anything about ALSC, but I'm inclined to believe in John's own description of why he wasn't hesitant to work within it.  As I remember, he characterized it as being in part a sort of collection of eccentrics of all kinds, each pursuing their own projects within it.  Sure, they may come together to some degree around opposition to current ideas -- including such things as "hostility to psychoanalytic criticism" -- but it's opposition from all kinds of different directions, much like _Theory's Empire_.  I don't know anything about Lee Patterson, but I do know that opposition of classical Marxists and some Enlightenment-believing anarcho-socialists like Noam Chomsky (i.e. the dreaded "left conservatives") to poco-y tropes is of long standing.

It's nice to see issues resolving themselves magically, while I sleep.

But yes, I'd say that the ALSC started as an anti-MLA, but over the years, has come to be just another scholarly association ... and one which, to its credit, has been far, far more supportive of everything that falls under the banner of "literary studies and electronic publishing stuff."  They've been much better about it than, say, the MLA, whose membership has (officially) demonstrated disturbingly little commitment to e-_anything_.

As for Karl's observation that it seems unusually hostile to psychoanalysis, I'd add what John (via Rich) said: as an organization, it originally appealed to anyone who felt their anti-orthodoxy was insufficiently understood in the '90s.  So you have some virulent anti-psychoanalysis types (Patterson, Crews), some anti-Marxist types, some anti-feminist types ... but the anti-psychoanalytic types are adamantly pro-Marxist, and the anti-feminist types are adamantly pro-psychoanalysis.  

And then you have some old school, New Critical types, like Morris Dickstein.  But even that position has moved closer to the MLA mainstream, making it more difficult to imagine the ALSC as an anti-MLA: 

I received an email from a graduate student yesterday (or the day before, they're all blending together), who talked about a panel at Yale entitled "What is Close Reading," in which Helen Vendler discussed the problematic shift away from close reading, then cited Stephen Schryer's as an attack on formalism in particular and New Criticism in general.  There's something ironic to be said about Vendler's "close" reading of Schryer's essay being, well, not so close to what Schryer wrote, but you see my general point -- strip the ALSC of its anti-this and anti-that factions, and it fairly closely tracks with the disciplinary shift back towards an emboldened, more capacious formalism.

(Not that I'm not a conservative tool, mind you.  I'm simply very sneaky about it.  The whole "defend the profession against the likes of KC Johnson" is but Act One.)

Well, it's perfectly consistent to defend the profession against the likes of KC Johnson and still be the kind of left-liberal that annoys certain parts of the left.

One of the things I disliked about the whole "you're either for Theory or against it" thing was that it collapsed politics both in the institutional/academic and larger sense.  Of course this dislike itself can be depicted as a part of an anti-liberal trope: they're always positioning themselves in the middle against an "equally bad" left and right, they're so moderate they might as well be on the right, so concerned with picky procedural fairness that they're unwilling to see what they're up to as they dominate our institutions, etc.

Wait, Rich, I got lost in your second graph: do the first set of they's refer to annoying left-liberals (what Sadly No would call the Yglesias set) and does the last they = the Right?

And, Rich, my reference to Luker above was to [this,](http://www.sadlyno.com/archives/7303.html) where, I just observe the irony after all our shouting, that Ralph is clearly, at least here, on the side of the angels.

_(Not that I'm not a conservative tool, mind you. I'm simply very sneaky about it. The whole "defend the profession against the likes of KC Johnson" is but Act One.)_

Maybe it's because I'm exhausted--3/3, with classes on Tues/Fri, and I just finished my 3rd class--but this cracked me up. I can't wait for Act II. 

(advice corner: stop doing conference papers Scott! You have enough at enough good places, and you've published more than enough, so just finish that bad boy. If a dipshit like me can get a TT at an okay school ABD, surely you can do better or at least as good!)
