_It is 23°F and SEK is rolling home from the store with a car full of cat litter and sushi when he spots his [HAT-HATING NEMESIS](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/10/crucial-omitted-detail-he-was-wearing-bright-red-shorts-and-had-tucked-a-yellow-polo-shirt-into-them) wearing a hat while taking out the trash._

**SEK:**(_to himself_) The worm has turned!

_SEK slows the car down as he approaches his HAT-HATING NEMESIS._

**SEK:**(_to himself_) This is gonna be great — I’m gonna nail his hat-hating ass for wearing a hat in the middle of winter. I’m gonna be even more Internet-famous now!

_HAT-HATING NEMESIS looks at SEK as he performs a patented “Prairieville drift” into 20 mph terrority._

**SEK:**(_to himself_) Time to roll down the window and give that fucking hypocrite what he deserves.

_HAT-HATING NEMESIS raises his arm and **politely waves at SEK**. SEK prepares to roll down the window and give him the ol’ what-for when…_

**SEK’S CAR STEREO:**“[Shouldn’t I have all of this — shouldn’t I have this — shouldn’t I have all of this and — _passionate kisses_!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXDntCyj7xs)”

**SEK:**(_VERY ALOUD_) FOR FUCK’S SAKE!

_SEK hits the gas and speeds off in shame._
