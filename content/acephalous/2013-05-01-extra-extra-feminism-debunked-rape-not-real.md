What are we going to do with all you lying bitches? Here _we_ are generously giving you privileges you don’t deserve, and _one_ of you pulls this shit? I just don’t—what else can I say?

We tried.

We tried to make you rational. We pretended not to ignore your vaginas and needs and civil rights and you [repay us](http://riehlworldview.com/2013/05/feminist-meg-lanker-simons-threatened-self-with-rape-framed-conservatives.html) [by having one of yours](http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2013/05/01/lib\_activist\_framed\_conservatives\_for\_rape\_threat) [fake rape](http://www.campusreform.org/blog/?ID=4731)? Don’t you realize this discredits everyone who shares your junk? Christ—that’s it. I’ve had enough.

Feminism is officially _cancelled_.

Shut the fuck up. I don’t want to hear it.

You don’t have the right to complain anymore. You could’ve stopped this _one_ woman from fabricating this _one_ rape _but you didn’t_. And I don’t want to hear about all the other rapes that are real or go unreported because I don’t.

I don’t want to hear about them.

This woman lied about a rape threat! Just imagine what the person she
 invented is going through right now. His fictional parents are crying 
great heavy tears at this false accusation against the son they never 
had.

If he already didn’t exist he’d be wishing he never had.

So that’s it feminists. If you can’t rally in defense of men who were never born then I just can’t fathom what you’re good for.
