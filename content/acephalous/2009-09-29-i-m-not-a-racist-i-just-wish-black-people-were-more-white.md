 * Tuesday, September 29, 2009



Listen closely to outrage manufactured over [an utterly innocuous NEA conference call](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/09/conservatives-are-outraged-over-an-actual-outrage-color-me-impressed.html) and you can almost hear Pat Buchanan  [regaling the Republican faithful](http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/patrickbuchanan1992rnc.htm#)
with tales of brave white soldiers taking "back the streets of Los
Angeles, block by block." Fearful his symbolism might prove too subtle,
he charged the overwhelmingly white audience to "take back our cities,
and take back our culture, and take back our country." He never
specified exactly who they would be taking back their cities, culture
and country _from_, but he didn't have to—one look at the army
that'd be doing the taking said it all. None of the current crop of
complaints are explicitly about race any more than Buchanan's speech at
the 1992 Republican Convention was, but now as then, one look at the
enemy they fear and the forces they align against it and the identity
of their antagonists becomes obvious.

The question, then, is
whether this is a story we want told twice. America, conservatives
insist, bought a false sale of goods, and the only way Obama can
sustain his popularity is to pull the wool before our eyes via the
political equivalent of an atomic wedgie: overt propaganda. Attacking
the National Endowment for the Arts comes straight from the '90s
script: every dollar the NEA disburses will be tracked by the likes of [Andrew Breitbart](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/) until [the perfect moment](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0884540464/diesekoschmar-20) to introduce the world to the next "[Piss Christ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piss\_Christ)" arrives. They've already begun to remind the troops of [all the old tropes](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/ggraham/2009/09/28/art-is-stuff-and-stuff-happens/),
but their attempt to preemptively undermine the institutional
credibility of the NEA indicates that this generation of conservative
critics might be more media savvy than their '90s counterparts. Tim
Slagle's [response](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/tslagle/2009/09/25/will-ferrell-and-co-answer-the-nea-call-shill-for-obamacare/) to a recent [MoveOn campaign](http://pol.moveon.org/insurance\_execs/?rc=homepage) is a sign of smears to come:
It looks like the NEA’s call for artists to promote health care initiatives has been heard by some comedy artists.

MoveOn
was not a party to the infamous conference call, but because it
involves actors, and actors are artists, it's a party to the propaganda
agenda established during that call. As a consequence of that call, all
artists—whether they shoot a crucifix in urine like Andrew Serrano or
urinate on themselves like Will Ferrell—will be seen as complicit in a
conspiracy to undermine America so grand even Goebbels would blush.

But
while they may be savvy, they're far from smart. In the article quoted
above, Slagle offers a "prize to anyone who can name all eight [actors
in the MoveOn video] without using Google," includes the name of all of
them in his tags not once, _but twice_, and his commenters are still stumped. And [the one](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2008/09/how-to-be-an-as.html) [and odious](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/01/whos-tribunaling-whose-what-to-whom-here.html) John Ziegler calls for a return to "the Golden Age of television (the 70's and 80's)," when Americans came together [to laugh at black people for the wrong reasons](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jziegler/2009/09/28/why-were-the-emmys-not-racist/), before he realized—or was told—that he should be laughing _at_ Archie Bunker, not _with_ him.

That his list of programs excludes _The Cosby Show_ is no surprise. He prefers _Sanford and Sons_ because its humor was a function of its characters' blackness, whereas the comedy on _Cosby_
was situational, and Ziegler found its situations implausible. How
could a black obstetrician treat white women without race becoming an
issue? The specter of miscegenation may not, I confess, be responsible
for him preferring Golden Age shows with majority black casts, but his
vision of American unity is undeniably odd:
The major
networks used to create a de facto “team photo” of our nation which
(after a slow start) eventually included everyone in the picture. Now,
each race, gender, and age group has their own “team” and tends to
watch programming that is built to only appeal to them. In short, we
end up living in very different realities with almost nothing in
common[.]

So in the Golden Age, when Norman Lear was adapting the BBC sitcoms _[Till Death Us Do Part](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Till\_Death\_Us\_Do\_Part\_%!B(MISSING)ritish\_TV\_series%!)(MISSING)_ and [_Steptoe and Son_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steptoe\_and\_Son)
for American audiences, television became "a de facto 'team photo' of
our nation [that] included everyone in the picture." First, white and
black do not a photograph of America make; second, in Ziegler's
photograph there are shows with majority white casts and shows with
majority black casts, but none, like _Cosby_, with what could be called _integrated casts_.
Ziegler further complains that his inability to find Tyler Perry funny
represents "a net loss to the strength of the fabric of our country,"
because once upon a time he could laugh at the scheming of Fred
Sanford, but now that black people have shows built to "appeal to
them," they appear to be "living in very different realities with
almost nothing in common."

He seems not to realize that _they did then and do now_.
A commenter who named himself after Dane Cook does his damnedest to
embody the plain racist underpinning of Ziegler's argument:
 For
the most part, blacks on television have assimilated into the
mainstream of society and no one thinks much about it any more.

The mainstream of society . . . they assimilated into the mainstream of society . . . now what would that be again?

"The Jeffersons" was (atrocious but) integrated, right? Even had miscegenation!

The meme that one is a racist for opposing Obama's agenda is getting tired, it's time for his promoters to add a new twist.  Besides, I don't understand why you fellows don't recognize the post racial aspect of those critical of Obama that they oppose him for his policies and not simply his race...

And, the problem with NEA call is that there was an overt attempt to use public funds in support of a partisan piece of legislation that the majority of the public opposes.  I mean, George Soros has deep pockets, let him bankroll these "artistic" endeavors; he's still the patron of the left, isn't he?

I didn't say that opposing Obama was racist: I pointed out that race played a significant role in Buchanan's infamous "Culture War Speech," that the last time 'round the culture warriors went after the NEA as well, and that race seems to be playing a role in the Culture Wars, Part II.  

In fact, not only am I _not_ saying that opposition to Obama is racist, I'm saying that---because racism is a structural element of the complaints of culture warriors---had Hillary won, we would still have seen an uptick in racially suspect remarks.

On the NEA and public opinion: really? Do you have a poll you can direct us to?

_he's still the patron of the left, isn't he?_  

What are some of the major Leftist media arms or think tanks or newspapers he's funding?

What about Scaife? Who's he funding? Who's funding Reason magazine?

Who is saying all opposition to Obama is racist, Bob? Are you saying none of it is?

Pardon me if I misunderstood, SEK,  

But there semed to be an underlying assertion along those lines that I percieved throughout your essay.  Perhaps it was more related to what you said more directly in your comment, that racism is a stuctural element of the culture wars.

I disagree with that too, and believe that it is no more an element of the culture wars than class, age, provinciality, and closed-mindedness are.

I think that the whole culture wars concept is one of perception though.  As many folks that feel somehow that women and minorities are culturally put upon, there are an almost equal number that feel our nation has become one of minority exceptionalism and the celebration of mediocrity-all in the name of a stilted "diversity" that is forcibly superimposed regardless of setting.  Neither extremem would have been what Dr. King was referring to when he spoke of a color blind society.

Karl,  

You misunderstand my sentance, the majority of the public is not opposed to the NEA, but is opposed to the health care legislation that the White House and the Democratic leadership in congress is proposing.

[http://tiny.cc/1pEmK](http://tiny.cc/1pEmK)

And I don't know if Scaife is behind "Reason" magazine, but I'll take your word for it.  It doesn't matter really though, because no public funds are going towards advancing his ideological agenda, which is the point I was making about Soros funding pro-Obama agenda art instead of the NEA.

Finally Karl, there are many on the left side of the political spectrum that decry the opposition to Obama's agenda as being revealing of racism, conscious or otherwise.  The list is too long for me to make a complete one, but let's start with Jimmy Carter, Howard Kurtz, Joe Klein, Maxine Waters to name but a few.  And while I never said that there are no racists who oppose Obama soley for his appearance, these are a minority-and nonexistent in the circles I run in, so to speak...

Hey, if you don't want to be called racist, don't hang around with fucking racists. It's that simple. Don't pretend you're the one opponent with pure, policy motivated objections to Obama and then hang around with people who walk around with whitefaced Obama posters.

Especially when you are now objecting to shit that was a lot worse in the previous eight years.
