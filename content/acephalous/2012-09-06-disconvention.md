[West of Apartment Complex](http://acephalous.typepad.com/zork.jpg)

You are standing in an open field west of a white townhouse, with a boarded front door. There is a small mailbox here.

&gt; e

The door is locked.

&gt; fuck door

I strongly advise against that course of action.

&gt; fuck you

We only just met.

&gt; open door

The door is still locked.

&gt; FUCK DOOR

Fine. After a vigorous rutting, the rusted hinges snap and the frustrated door bends until its disappointed timbers give up and finish clattering themselves to the ground alone. You are standing in an open field west of a white townhouse, with a open door and an unsatisfied pile of wood. There is a small mailbox here.

&gt; e

You are in the kitchen of the white townhouse. A table seems to have
been used recently for the preparation of food. Next to it is an empty chair. A passage leads to
the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. To the
east is a small window which is open.
On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.
A clear glass bottle is here.
The glass bottle contains: A quantity of water.

&gt; w

You are standing in an open field west of a white townhouse, with a open
 door and an unsatisfied pile of wood. There is a small mailbox here.

&gt; look wood 

The pile of wood refuses to return eye contact. 

&gt; FUCK WOOD

Haven't you done enough already? Leave the poor pile of wood alone. Just go east.

&gt; FUCK EAST

You cannot have sexual intercourse with a cardinal direction. 

&gt; so fuck wood

You cannot have sexual intercourse with east or wood. But there may be someone or something in the white townhouse with whom or which you can have sexual relations. 

&gt; fine e

&gt; drink problem

A clear glass bottle is here. The glass bottle contains: A quantity of water. Drinking it may help restore your wits.

&gt; no just sit

You are seated on the floor next to the empty chair occupied by the invisible Black President.

&gt; sit in CHAIR

The empty chair is currently occupied by the invisible Black President.

He cannot move. His presence is sustained by the power of your belief in it.

&gt; FUCK YOU INVISIBLE BLACK PRESIDENTS

Anything else?

&gt; INVISIBLE BLACK PRESIDENTS SUCK

Afghantistan is too far away.
