I've been nominated for a [2007 Weblog Award](http://2007.weblogawards.org/news/finalists-announced.php).  I'm up for "The Best of the Top 2501 - 3500 Blogs."  I don't know what that means, but damn it, I want to win.  (I wouldn't care, but I was nominated for this by one of [literature's greatest minds](http://jonswift.blogspot.com/) and the [sharpest of the New Critics](http://2007.weblogawards.org/nominations/best-literature-blog.php#comment-7994).)  

(That and I must always win everything.)

My competition consists of dull political linkers and [a hippie](http://faultline.org/).  I'll whip the politicos no problem, but the hippie worries me, as he's [damn talented](http://faultline.org/index.php/site/comments/whats\_liberal\_about\_the\_liberal\_arts1/).  

I'm hoping to ride my [Winning of the Internets](http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/003564.html) to victory here—should that prove impossible, I'll resort to begging and groveling.  I'll alert you when the voting starts.  

(Remember: this isn't about me winning, it's about the hippie losing.)

I say good luck but the fact that Achewood is not in the best comic category suggests to me that this whole thing is a sham, a damn, dirty sham.  I know the writing has been uneven for the last month or two, but Achewood deserves a place on any list of the greatest comics, online or not.

_My competition consists of dull political linkers_  

Is that the best you could come up with. Damn, I must really be off my game because normally I get a better insult.
