## Someone should tell John Nolte that tendentious people ought not call others tendentious.

Yet [again](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/08/tendentious-people-are-tendentious-and-frequently-dumb), the duty falls to me.  Here goes: Nolte is complaining about Steven Zeitchik’s [article](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/08/the-expendables-sylvester-stallone-action-movies-guns.html?utm\_source=latimes.com&utm\_medium=twitter) in the _L.A. Times_, in which he writes:

But the Stallone picture—with its hard-charging,  take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real  world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its  caricature of freedom-hating enemies (”We will kill this American  disease,” as the TV spot enticed us)—planted itself squarely in the  old-school genre.

According to Nolte, this amounts to Zeitchik “toxifying ‘The  Expendables’ by ridiculing its simple worldview,” but Nolte fails to  explain why a film should be _praised_ for the simplicity of its  worldview.  The most he can muster is that “the nihilism found in the  moral equivalency preached by the likes of George Clooney and Paul  Haggis is [not] complicated,” which amounts to “if they can do it, we  can do it.”  The problem with that logic should be obvious: it’s not a  defense of simplistic worldviews, it’s the claim that if I set your  house on fire, you would be right to retaliate by doing the same to  mine.  That _both_ positions may be weak is evidently a point beyond his ability to comprehend.

Nolte then provides another non-answer, claiming that a

simple straight-forward story that’s actually about  something is much more difficult to successfully craft than a confusing  and muddled story that’s believes in absolutely nothing.  Paint-by-numbers might not be Rembrandt but it takes more skill than  throwing monkey shit at a canvas.

Note that he [again](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/08/tendentious-people-are-tendentious-and-frequently-dumb) argues that _The Expendables_ is “about” something without ever defining what that thing is.  This is  the obverse of Groucho Marx’s “Whatever It Is, I’m Against It”  argument, in that whatever _The Expendables_ is about, Nolte’s in  favor of it, whatever it might be.  But whatever it is, it’s morally  unambiguous, which means the following claim of Zeitchik is utter bunk:

[u]ntil this weekend, old-school action movies—defined,  for argument’s sake, as films with a slew of explosions, a shortage of  moral ambiguity and a triumph of physical effects over digital ones—had  seen better days.

Nolte responds:

[T]his is what happens when you’re in possession of a  laughably biased theory in search of proof—especially when the surprise  successes of  “300″ and “Taken,” not to mention “Salt,” the first  “Transformers,” and “Gran Torino”—make a total fool of that moral  ambiguity theory.

Admittedly, Nolte is an expert in all things tendentious, so he  should know it when he sees it.  But a brief comparison of the material  between both parties’ em-dashes demonstrates who’s arguing honestly and  who isn’t.  Zeitchik defines “old-school action movies … as films with a  slew of explosions, a shortage of moral ambiguity and a triumph of  physical effects over digital ones.”  Nolte responds by listing four  films, but only one of them, _Taken_, fits Zeitchik’s definition.  _300_ was filmed entirely in front of a green screen; _Gran Torino_ contains no “explosions,” much less “a slew of” them; and unless he knows something I don’t, the Transformers in _Transformers_ aren’t “physical effects.”

In short, Nolte isn’t refuting Zeitchik so much as talking right past  him.  Why?  Because, to quote the man himself, “this is what happens  when you’re in possession of a laughably biased theory in search of  proof.”

Scott, I'll probably get called a troll for this, but I think you've misread Nolte here.  He writes, "especially when the surprise successes of '300' and 'Taken,' not to mention 'Salt,' the first 'Transformers,' and 'Gran Torino'—make a total fool of that moral ambiguity theory."

As far as I can tell, he's not saying these films fit all of the LA Times guy's criteria; he's just saying that these films all avoid moral ambiguity and have been quite successful, suggesting that such films haven't fallen on hard times.

I don't think that sounds trollish at all--or that what you wrote on that other thread did either.  Just curmudgeonly, is all.  As for Nolte, he's setting up a false equivalence: Zeitchik isn't talking about moral ambiguity in isolation, but as a component in what he refers to as "old-school action movies."  Nolte attacks him on the basis of there having been, recently, morally unambiguous films, despite that not having been Zeitchik's point.  This is a classic example of finding, and only finding, those elements of an argument you were looking for ... it's just most people are so dumb as to include a list of features that proves that that's exactly what we were up to.

But the problem is that Zeitchik is equally slimy here in the way he defines "old school action movie" in the first place.  I mean, it's like saying "the old school novel was only in book format, but the new school novel is in book and electronic format," and using that distinction for an argument about the decline of the old school novel.

But an action movie needn't have a slew of explosions.  \*Jaws\* is definitely an old school action movie, even with its lack of much action for a good deal of the film, as is \*Shaft\* or \*Superfly\*, neither of which involves explosions.  And an action movie cannot be defined around how its special effects are achieved (which would be like defining literary genres around the type of ink or printing press used).  

So I don't see why Nolte, who is mainly interested in the issue of moral ambiguity in his piece, needs to address Zeitchik's rather silly genre definition.  Nolte's point is that the true form of action movie is not in decline and that a manichean worldview is not a point against an action film.

It seems to me like both Zeitchik and Nolte are rather limited thinkers.  What's your horse in this race?  Is it simply that Big Hollywood is where writing about cinema goes to die?  Or are you interested in something about Stallone's film?

_\*Jaws\* is definitely an old school action movie, even with its lack of much action for a good deal of the film, as is \*Shaft\* or \*Superfly\*, neither of which involves explosions._

_Jaws_ is no more an action film than _The Birds_, and I'd list them both under suspense.  _Shaft_ is a blaxploitation film that takes its narrative cues from Chandler and Hammett and its visual ones from police procedures.  The "action film" as an aesthetic object is a product of the '80s, and can be described in further detail than Zeitchik did and, to put it to the ultimate criterion of a category, generate a substantial list of aesthetic objects from the same period that share the details described.  They need not even be successful: Dolph Lundgren is a failed action movie star if there ever was one, but his films, despite being failures, are action films nonetheless. 

_What's your horse in this race?_

Railing against the flattening of culture into ideology?  Or maybe the other way around, and I'm railing against the elevation of certain cultural artifacts on the basis of ideology.  It's one thing, for example, for you and I to disagree about the merits of Edgar Wright, another entirely if one of us were to dismiss it on account of its normalization of homosexuality.  That's not the game afoot here, though, with Breitbart and his minions: they're old school culture warriors and their voices are gaining traction.  I see it everyday on Facebook, and a lot of the conservative nonsense I write about begins as a reply to a link posted by someone I know, or think I know, is a decent person, but they happen to live in an environs (the South) that's militating against their dignity.

All right, I can dig that.  Breitbart is a vampire if ever there were one.

I suppose I'm not seeing the difference between the 80s action film and the longer tradition of adventure and action films, from \*Bridge Over the River Kwai\* and \*The Dirty Dozen\* to \*Jaws\* to \*Indiana Jones\* to Lundgren's material.
