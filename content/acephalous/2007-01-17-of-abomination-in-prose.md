## Of Abomination in Prose

Whoever will revise a work of mine knows how impressionable I am, and how indulgent in my whims, to what location soever they direct me, here near and comforting, there remote and disturbing: always shifting without reason, like fickle winds, which wear away foundations now from the north, now from the south; so my voice, once stable, sways and threatens ruin: these are common menaces, and having, peradventure, thought of them a thousand times, I am afraid I have set them down somewhere else, and more profitably; but never in the style of Montaigne, whose sentences, in translation, kick and whinny like a sleeping horse, bucking nothing, stampeding nowhere; in this manner, his manner, I have yet to testify how the pacing and the phrasing of the words before my eyes works upon those my pen extrudes, or how I abominate the resultant inanity.

It's okay to take a break if you're tired of blogging.

Tired?  A bit, but of writing generally.  Blogging's its most enjoyable instantiation.  Mostly though, I'm tired of reading my own prose and being able to pinpoint, with uncanny accuracy, what I'd been reading when I wrote it.  Looking over yesterday's revision, I couldn't help but note how, full of Montaigne's long and loping sentences, my own partook of their "drunken, stumbling, reeling, infirm motion."  (_See!  I did it again!  "Partook"?  Who says "partook"?  Not I!_)

I also tend to mimic styles.  It was pretty bad when I was freelancing a couple summers ago, reading corporate 10-Ks all day long.

You know who screws me up? Bataille. I almost never read him, but when I do, it's like getting Lyme disease. I just can't shake it.
