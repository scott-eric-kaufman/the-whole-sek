Would it be the [latest](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/hudlash/2010/03/14/obama-nation-much-needed-health-care/)
 _Obama Nation_ comic by James Hudnall and Batton Lash:

Or [this painting](http://io9.com/5492977/the-most-self+explanatory-painting-in-human-history) of Batman stabbing a shark with a lightsaber:

[![Batman-stabbing-a-shark-with-a-lightsaber](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a9375ee3970b-500wi)](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a9375ee3970b-popup)

The fact that this is even arguable speaks volumes about the current state of political discourse on the right today.

They're both bad art, but the second one is intentionally funny.

I don't even understand the first one, though.  I mean, what does that even mean?  Are the doctors behind him threatening him because he's insane?  Presumably not, since they're his political props.  Are they threatening him because he's saying too much?  Maybe, but that would mean he's working for them, not the other way around, and since now of them is George Soros, etc. etc. etc. _I can't parse it_.

I think you were right the first time: though they may have started as political props, they've realized that Obama's irrational and dangerous and are taking necessary action. Or, it's possible -- if we're assuming the best of the cartoonists (it took two people to do that?) -- that the first image is part of his delusional belief that the doctors are there to support him, when they're really coming to take him away, ha ha.

FYI: Hudnall's over at _LGM_ [informing me](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/03/which-of-the-following-images-that-appeared-in-google-reader-today-makes-more-sense/comment-page-1#comment-36914) that I'll "get it" when I "grow up."  Presumably, its meaning is transparent and we're just dolts.

That cartoon is stoking fear about giving control over to the self-proclaimed smartest guys in the room.  In the first panel Obama the technocrat is bragging about the plan he is going to implement.  In the second panel, the plan has allowed nefarious doctors have to take control.  Obama the technocrat, already suffering but failing to understand why, is undeterred and begins articulating another foolish technocratic solution to a non-problem.

Why did they draw Dubya's ears on him though?  Is this a subliminal message?

Well, they're assumed to be his political props in the first panel, but in the second they're really "the men in white coats" coming to put him away because he's talking crazy.

By the way, when was the golden age of political discourse?

Everyone else here probably knows this already, but I just discovered that the second image is a takeoff on an existing image -- the version I encountered in _Batman RIP_ is clearly a memory from before, so it may have had several incarnations before this one -- though the shark anatomy isn't quite so bad.

You have to remember that it's _James Hudnall_ who wrote the first cartoon [1] and political or not, he has always been a godawful writer and a Dunner-Kruger effect sufferer, in that he thinks he's much smarter than he really is. Telling you to grow up is entirely in character.

[1] though it saddens me to see Batton Lash involved; he used to be better than this.

The second one is the one that doesn't make sense.  The shark is missing his pectoral fin.
