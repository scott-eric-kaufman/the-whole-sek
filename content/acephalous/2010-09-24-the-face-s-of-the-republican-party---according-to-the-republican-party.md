I know that Yglesias [wants me to analyze the iconography](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/09/iconography-of-the-pledge/) of the Republican's "[Pledge to America](http://pledge.gop.gov/resources/library/documents/pledge/a-pledge-to-america.pdf)," and I'll do so a little later.  But for the moment, I think it's worth reiterating what he wrote _with a cudgel_.  So without further ado, here is how the Republican Party chooses to represent itself when given the opportunity to do so however it damn well pleases:

Scott, you know I trust you, but I still had to click through and confirm that you were neither omitting nor exaggerating because I honestly couldn't believe that they'd be so careless, so ignorant, so inattentive ... none of those quite capture what I'm going for here ... so _obvious_ about the appeal to their base and so eager to ignore their margins.

I know you trust me, and I know that after you clicked through, you still do.  It's really _that_ egregious.

_I know that after you clicked through, you still do_

That goes without saying: you know (and I think everyone who reads you knows) that if I have a beef, a question or a quibble, I'll share it. This time, I'm nearly speechless. 

Did you save a copy of the PDF? Because if I were the Republican caucus, I'd do some revision post haste. Or maybe not: that will tell us something, too.

Yglesias is right, though: that sunset cowboy shot is just too precious for words.

There's a woman of colour in the front row, fifth picture from the bottom!  That completely invalidates your argument Scott, because once you factor her in, you see that these photographs represent the statistical spread of ethnicity in the US (99.99%!W(MISSING)hite, 0.01%!A(MISSING)frican-American) with perfect accuracy.

To my utter surprise, the comments in the linked Yglesias thread are (at this moment) good and funny.

Well, we also need to view this image not only in terms of race and ethnicity, but also in terms of age. This is a fairly senior crowd with few exceptions.

Do you have any pictures of the Democrats in Congress? Do you have any pictures of the people that run charity groups aimed at helping the poor? Does age and sex matter or just skin color? Are you one of those one-drop guys?  - Keep up the good work. You are a regular Atticus Finch, and I'm sure all people or color bow their heads before you as you walk by.
