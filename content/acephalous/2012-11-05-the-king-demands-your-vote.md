I'm far too refined to write about something as petty and droll as a Presidential election, but I thought I'd share this utterly unrelated series of images I concocted for [my _Game of Thrones_ class](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/game-of-thrones/). The idea is simple: this one character, Joffrey, believes he should sit on the Iron Throne because

[![BECAUSE I LOOK KINGLY](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee4c78b53970d-500wi "BECAUSE I LOOK KINGLY")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee4c78b53970d-popup)

As if looking like someone central casting would consider a king should be a consideration. But there are more substantive reasons he believes he should have the Iron Throne, for example

[![BECAUSE I WANT IT](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3d522449970c-500wi "BECAUSE I WANT IT")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3d522449970c-popup)

Why does he want it? Because

[![BECAUSE THEY PROMISED](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3d5227e2970c-500wi "BECAUSE THEY PROMISED")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3d5227e2970c-popup)

I'm not sure that's a good rea—

[![BECAUSE I WANT TO BE KING](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3d522afc970c-500wi "BECAUSE I WANT TO BE KING")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3d522afc970c-popup)

Calm down, little lordling. Nothing can stop you from being crown—

[![BECAUSE FRAUD ACORN WHITE WALKERS](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c33238e9c970b-500wi "BECAUSE FRAUD ACORN WHITE WALKERS")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017c33238e9c970b-popup)

I wouldn't worry about them. What was it you told me earlier?

[![BECAUSE THE OTHER GUY IS PROBABLY](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3d522f61970c-500wi "BECAUSE THE OTHER GUY IS PROBABLY")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017d3d522f61970c-popup)

Exactly. All kneel before Joffrey, scion of greatness, sole hope for the realm!
