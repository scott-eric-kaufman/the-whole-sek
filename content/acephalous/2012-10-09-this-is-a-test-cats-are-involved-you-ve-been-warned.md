## This is a test. Cats are involved. You've been warned.

Typepad's been reluctant to let me post images and has been reshuffling them when it does. So this is a test. Because it's on the Internet it involves cat pictures. This should be a cat informing you that he can see dead people:

[![IMG\_3301](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee4100fc1970d-500wi "IMG\_3301")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee4100fc1970d-popup)

This should be a cat yowling the opening notes of "Immigrant Song":

[![IMG\_3290](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee4100ef0970d-500wi "IMG\_3290")](http://acephalous.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c2df453ef017ee4100ef0970d-popup)

When Typepad let me post on Monday it reshuffled the images about an hour after I posted, so that's how long this post will remain up. If all goes well it'll be replaced by one about _Fellowship_ and _Game of Thrones_ later this afternoon.

**UPDATE:** That obviously didn't work. If you're interested in the sausage-making, I'll just say that on the back-end, they're in the right order. They just won't display that way. Might not seem like a big deal with two images, but imagine it with twenty (which is my average per visual rhetoric post). And if you're wondering whether I'm complaining in public because I'm not entirely satisfied with the service I've received behind-the-scenes, well ...

Your cats are so cute! But the screaming one is up top and the startled one on the bottom pic.

My cat thinks he's a cable box.

I saw your cable-box. Mine like to pretend they're books any time shelf space becomes available.

Cats are still backwards, but leave them up, they humanize you.

Does it help if you do typepad's version of editing the raw html of the post, and check that the &lt;img src="this bit.jog" stuff looks right?

It does. I thought it may have something to do with the numbering of the images, but when I looked at my second (as of now unpublished) _Fellowship_ post, it just shuffled them like a deck of cards. I'm not sure why it's only a problem with new posts and not old ones, if it's a coding issue. Basically, at the moment, the blog's just broke. (And I can't host these images on LGM for fear of future fair-use lawsuits. So sayeth the lawyers. And they're right. As soon as I'm not a teacher, I can't claim to be using them for a pedagogical purpose, etc.)

Resolved: Do not disregard warnings.

I'm trying to un-break the blog. Can't do that if I don't have some HTML to compare the front end to the back. Sorry! Promise, actual content to follow as soon as I figure out what the problem is.
