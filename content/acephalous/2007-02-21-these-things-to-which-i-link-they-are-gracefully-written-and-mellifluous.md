From [Geoff Manaugh](http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/transparent-soil-and-gardens-of.html):
This reminds me of an image I've had in my head for several years now,
which is a forest, growing at its own faunal pace, over years, decades,
and even centuries, yet all the plants are rooted in _transparent soil_—clear hillsides like plastic or glass—so you can actually sit there
in the sun, reading Charles Darwin, every day, every week, watching
those slow and ancient roots push deeper and deeper through the surface
of the earth.  Worms crawl, as if through space, forming tunnels—underground landscapes of air.

And [Scott McLemee](http://insidehighered.com/views/2007/02/21/mclemee):
And so for decades the majority of Jefferson scholars demonstrated their staunch refusal to be taken in by subtle Negroes.

Transparent soil -- wow.   Sounds like an image from onee of Paul Chadwick's \_Concrete\_ comics.

Ant farms work that way these days: instead of sand, they trap moist edible gel between  the panes, so you don't even have to feed or water the ants.

As for "subtle  Negroes"....  As opposed to overt Negroes?

Maybe they're stealth Negroes, disguised as Caucasians,  or Inuit, or floor lamps,  or something.

Or maybe they're  Ninja Negroes, silent and invisible.
