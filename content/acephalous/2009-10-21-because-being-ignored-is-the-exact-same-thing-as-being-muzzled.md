## Because being ignored is the exact same thing as being muzzled.

			The attacks on the administration and its allies for deciding to shun Fox News are so cute. This is [my favorite](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=15427):  
In [Obama's] America there is no Constitution, there is no First Amendment, there are no _principles of free speech or free press_.As all good children know, the silent treatment renders the person to whom it's administered _incapable of saying anything_.
They can't run around shouting, "Why are you ignoring me?" or "What did
I do? Please tell me!" because their tongue has been silenced by the
mystical power of the treatment. It makes a person wonder what Fox will
air now that their hosts have lost their words. An hour of Glenn Beck
sobbing uncontrollably while pointing at a chalkboard on which the
links between ACORN and his muted mouth-hole have been arranged into a
misspelled anagram? Granted, they were ready to go with the sobbing and
pointing _before_ the Plague of Silence zipped his mouth and pocketed the key . . .

. . . but seriously, because this is serious, serious stuff, otherwise Jake Tapper wouldn't be [on the case](http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/10/todays-qs-for-os-wh-10202009.html):  
**Tapper:** But that’s a pretty sweeping declaration that they are “not a news organization.” How are they any different from, say—  

**Gibbs:** ABC—  

**Tapper:** ABC. MSNBC. Univision. I mean how are they any different?I will answer this question, both for Tapper and the [conservatives](http://hotair.com/archives/2009/10/20/tapper-to-gibbs-who-are-you-to-decide-what-constitutes-a-news-organization/) who think the Obama administration is politicizing news coverage, via another childhood staple:  
**One of these [Presidents of network news divisions] is not like the others. One of these [lives] is just not the same.**  

**[Jonathan Klein](http://www.cnn.com/CNN/anchors\_reporters/klein.jonathan.html) (CNN)**, worked for WLNE in Providence, R.I. before becoming a broadcast producer for CBS News.  

**[Steve Capus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve\_Capus) (NBC)**, worked for WCAU and KYW in Philadelphia before becoming an executive producer for NBC News.  

**[Sean McManus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean\_McManus\_%!t(MISSING)elevision\_executive%!)(MISSING) (CBS)**, worked for ABC News before managing sports broadcasting for CBS.  

**[David Westin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David\_Westin) (ABC)**, clerked for Nixon appointee and dogged moderate Lewis Powell before working as in-house counsel for ABC.  

**[Roger Ailes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger\_Ailes#Political\_consulting) (FOX)**, served as a political consultant for Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Rudolph Giuliani.

I'm
sure Tapper and company will continue to claim the administration
playing politics by excluding the network chaired by a Republican
operative, but honestly, I'm not sure why _anyone_ thinks a
Democrat should talk to representatives of a network whose president
has devoted his life to championing Republican causes. I suppose the
Democrats should also let Republicans strategists produce their
campaign ads, as that would eliminate some of the dishonest viciousness
of elections—after all, there's no need to [Willie Horton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving\_Door\_%!t(MISSING)elevision\_advertisement%!)(MISSING) a Democrat whose campaign you already drove off a cliff.

Fox had twenty years to prove themselves a legitimate news organization, and failed.

In fairness (and balance!), I don't think they were really trying very hard.  Which would be fine except that now they seem to expect their entire history not to count against them in this regard.
