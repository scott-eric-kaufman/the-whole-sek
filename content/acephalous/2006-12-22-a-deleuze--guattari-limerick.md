			Deleuze and his pal Guattari,  
Bought a house near the beach, _aujourd'hui_,  
"But our _Anti-Oedipe_  
Make ze townpeoples fleep,  
Ze will drive us both _schizophrénie!_"

I recently re-read the _Coldness and Cruelty_ book, on Sachor-Masoch.  Which was D., not G., but nonetheless.

That sweet pair Deleuze and Guattari  

Liked to dress in trou_serz_ and a sari;  

Til they cried, most emphatic,  

"Let's be _more_ rhizomatic,  

Dress as _Venus in Furs_ and Prince Harry."

The team of Deleuze and Guattari  

took a long rhizomatic safari.  

They said their _Guten Morgen_s  

to the body without organs...  

I can't think of any more: sorry.

Alternate ending suggested by Anthony:

"I know that they weren't German: sorry."

[From previous post]

_If you're asking for my appraisal of the Wachowski brother's oeuvre, well, that would take more time than I currently have. But I do like requests, so if you're serious, say the word..._

If it doesn't cost you your health, I'd be more than happy to see that!

_It seems kind of a strange choice._

For a limerick? You _do_ know that Deleuze was from Nantucket. / and he told arboreal orders to suck it / until one smoky day, / through the window, tombé, / now, a b/w/o inna bucket.

_Now_ I see.  Nothing mysterious (or serious) here.  Like Karl's (superior) limerick in the post below, the point is to demonstrate enough familiarity with the thinker's work to write a limerick that does it justice...which should make it funny, or so I thought.  So the Zizek one depended on knowing enough about Zizek's early reception to realize that he wasn't taken seriously until he turned to popular culture -- an irony someone should write about, if someone hasn't already -- and this one, it depends on knowing a little about the backlash against Deleuze and Guattari's popularity.

I codify random information like this all the time -- I only share it when that commodity becomes rare, like when you're home for Christmas, finishing a chapter, an article for _CI_ and the talk you're going to give at the MLA in t-minus nine days...

(For the record, I was thinking about Deleuze because I half-remembered his quote about academics' lives being dull because they travel by hot air, and spent the better part of an afternoon tracking it down.)

"I codify random information like this all the time."

I think we have the real reason the lives of academics are dull. You do this kind of stuff for... fun? I'm going back to the discussion about porn and religion at the weblog. Porn over limericks - that's my motto. Then again, I'll never get a job.

I also do _other_ stuff for fun ... but yes, I do remember information via mnemonics, as well as Giordano Bruno's method of visualization.  What's wrong with that?

And anyway, Mr. High Fun and Mighty, what do _you_ do for entertainment?  Comment on blogs, perhaps?

Well, aside from the difficulty I have in figuring out how your limerick would help you remember anything about Deleuze and Guattari, nothing is _wrong_ with it. I'm just usually suspicious of what’s to come after a post like this is all. 

Fun? I drink heavily, watch television, or ride my bike. Sometimes I talk to people. I only comment on blogs when I'm writing papers. You’d really hate the one I’m working on now – it’s about religion and plays fast and loose with historical issues.

Karl's last limerick was really rude, but by far the funniest in a dark way.

_Well, aside from the difficulty I have in figuring out how your limerick would help you remember anything about Deleuze and Guattari, nothing is wrong with it._

The original—which scanned worse than this—I'd scrawled in my copy of _Anti-Oedipus_ in 1999 when I was taking [John Protevi](http://www.protevi.com/john/)'s course on Deleuze and Guattari.  I'm not sure why the backlash was important anymore, but I do know that it existed, and that it took the form of popular antipathy to philosophical bourgeoisie discussing the liberatory rhetoric of schizophrenia.  (Granted, I don't do this so much anymore, but even if it ain't [the Cornell System](http://rauchway.ucdavis.edu/mt/archives/cornellsystem2.html), it did the trick when I was an undergrad.)

_You’d really hate the one I’m working on now – it’s about religion and plays fast and loose with historical issues._

I wouldn't _hate_ it because it's about religion—much of what I write is too, if indirectly—plus, and I think this is one of the reasons you see hostility when none exists, I'm not averse to ahistorical arguments about conceptual topics.  I think they still need to be contextualized, _i.e._ demonstrated why they fit into a contemporary contextual framework, or that their warp and woof haven't been unjustly distorted by the fitting, but I'm not opposed to the move altogether.  

_Karl's last limerick was really rude, but by far the funniest in a dark way._

Hence, the props.  (Cue ben, though, as it doesn't scan.)

Rude to whom? If you thought I was being rude to you, APS, my apologies! I was just being opportunistic. As for the blessed bodies of the dead: well.

SEK: honored--over-honored, in fact--and, at any rate, I can hardly keep up with my own end of the triumvirate at [at a group blog.](jjcohen.blogspot.com) Depending on when your panel is next week, I'll show up and applaud you and MB and others. And perhaps I'll throw keys, which is how my people show praise.

_Porn over limericks - that's my motto._ 

But Anthony, people at The Weblog are only _talking_ about porn, whereas here, _actual limericks_ (sort of) are being produced.

Typical of you, though, to prefer head-in-the-clouds chatter about something to come while ignoring the possibility of here-and-now action.

Since I know you won't realize, the previous sentence is a joke.
