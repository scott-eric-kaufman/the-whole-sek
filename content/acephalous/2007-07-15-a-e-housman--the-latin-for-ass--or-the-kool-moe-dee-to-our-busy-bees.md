Hunting down the source of the Latin maxim with which Wharton closes "[The Descent of Man](http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/WhaDesc.html)"—"_labor est etiam ipsa voluptas_" ("toil is itself a pleasure")—I came across [numerous articles](http://www.jstor.org/search/BasicResults?Search=Search&Query=aa:%!A(MISSING).%!E(MISSING).%!H(MISSING)ousman%!&(MISSING)hp=100&si=1&wc=on) by A.E. Housman, best known to high-schoolers as the author of "[To An Athlete Dying Young](http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=HouShro.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=20&division=div1)."  Regrettably, before tonight I knew little more about Housman now than I did in high school; by which I mean, it could've been summarized "'we chaired you through the market-place' taught me how to verb."  Now that I've become acquainted with him as a classical scholar, however, that's certain to change.  If the below's indicative of his professional correspondence, I can't wait to read his letters.

Perhaps this is well-known to all them what ain't rubes like me, but Housman tore his contemporaries new ones faster and harder and bigger than anyone [this side of Stanley Fish](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/05/the\_position\_or.html).  Strike that.  His is the withering to which Fish-wit aspires.  Consider his introduction to Juvenal:
Frailty of understanding is in itself no proper target for scorn and mockery ... but the unintelligent forfeit their claim to compassion when they begin to indulge in self-complacent airs, and to call themselves sane critics, meaning they are mechanics.  And when, relying on their numbers, they pass from self-complacency to insolence, and reprove their betters for using the brains which God has denied them, they dry up the fount of pity. (xiii.)
