## I Have Production Values: "Is an 'Academic Blog' an Oxymoron?"

I'm reluctant to link to this because I'd rather not be associated with what this fool said ... but I feel I have no choice.  Before you ask: I guestimate readership by adding unique page views to Feedburner subscribers, which seems to me the best way to calculate how many people read your blog daily.  (But I've been wrong before.)  

There may also be some information I didn't share with the class when I first posted some items ... but what can I say?  The truth never appears online, no matter how much we pray Trent Lott left a paper trail.  So without further ado, here's what I said.  (Please don't watch it, as I sound as foolish as I look.)  

Part one:




Part two:




The Q & A can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQI4npmXCEM) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CFVZXYYqQ).  Be warned: I talk of Casper and the ensuing fiasco, which you'll find dull and should skip.

(Thanks to [Liz Losh](http://virtualpolitik.blogspot.com/), without whose [sense of professional responsibility](http://www.sivacracy.net/2007/11/peter\_krapp\_explains\_why\_he\_ga.html) I'd still have my dignity.)

Thanks for posting these interesting clips so that people far from UCI could have a look.  I gave a talk on blogging and academic publishing in my own department not long ago and made a similar point about the small audience for academic publications vs. the (potentially) much larger one for open-access (and less formal) sources such as blogs.  In response, one of my colleagues argued that the non-academic readership for scholarly work is actually larger than we typically suppose.  His field is popular culture (so, for instance, he could cite non-academic references to work of his on "The Matrix") so his experience and impressions would not necessarily be representative, but I'm wondering if you (or your readers) have any thoughts on this.

By your accent I'm guessing you're ... _American_; am I right?  Am I right?

In the area of celebrity lookalikes, you know who you sort of look like? A slimmer [Greg Grunberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg\_Grunberg) with facial hair.

I was going to guess Canadian.

Sad about the dignity, though.

Nice to hear and see you. Interesting talk but, "uhm" is not a word in the English language. I was less impresses with your other speaker because he seems to take a negative view about what you are doing. Watch out for the big guys on campus, they may not like what you are saying.  I know about freedom of speech and I also know words written can come back to bite you in the butt, but nothing risked is nothing gained. You do look like your brother and so you look like your father - I never see mom when I look at your but, know I spend this month each year reliving your infancy and little boy life.

Also: 'here's a post by John Holbo of the University of Singapore ... and _here's_ one by somebody who's edited the ... er ... Cambridge, or Oxford ... the, er ... by someone else.'  What's _that_ about?

I was trying to make you sound EVEN MORE impressive: I meant to mention the History of Science Fiction, stopped, started to mention the Browning, stopped, started, stopped, panicked, moved on.  (The poise on my face is all pose, brother, all pose.)

Given the time you had, I'd say it was a good showing. I've given similar talks, and there's really nothing else _to_ do but show them the range of things that people _do_ and hope that something catches their interest.

Really interesting talk, Scott!  Still enjoying the blog as well.

Looks more like Adam Goldberg to me (good god it took forever to find that name.  I had to look up like every single mid 90s movie.)

Thumbs up on the beard.

"The poise on my face is all pose, brother"

Not at all.  It's very poisey indeed.  You're a natural.

Missed these comments somehow.  Stupid "spam" filters.

Adam: "You're a natural."  The question is, _at what_?

Aimee: Thanks, and it's good to see you're still around.  Gaining readers is as easy as walking into other people having sex in your office; retaining them, however ...

J.S. Nelson: It's not really a beard _per se_ ... more like "embodied laziness."  And I've gotten the Goldberg thing since I hit puberty.  Rich's comment is spot on, though, as when my wife and I started watching _Alias_, we were agog when we saw that guy for the first time.  Is that ... my _dad_, twenty years ago?
