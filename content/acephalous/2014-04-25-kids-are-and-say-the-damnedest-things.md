_Child of a blood relative of SEK’s roommate, upon learning that SEK’s not a blood relative of his roommate:_

**CHILD:** So, do you have a last name?

**SEK:** No, actually, I was born without one.

**CHILD:** God let you do that?

**SEK:** Yes.

**CHILD:** Can you get him to take mine back? I want mine to be ‘Pouncing Cat.’

**SEK:** I’ll see what I can do.
