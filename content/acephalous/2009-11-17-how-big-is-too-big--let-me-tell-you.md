My old monitor was issuing death rattles—taking three days to turn on without flickering and the like—so with the money you people so generously provided by buying stuff I recommend from Amazon, I purchased [a new one](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001LYPIIS/diesekoschmar-20) under the impression that it was the same size as my current one.  

It is not.  

It is oppressively large.  

It _looms_ over me.  

I moved it further back on the desk and am slouching in my chair not because I have good eyes and bad posture, but because _I am frightened by the monstrosity in front of me._ I can now fit three formerly maximized windows on my screen at the same time, or (and this might not be a bad thing), maximize a single window and [become more creative through the power of bilateral symmetry](http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2009/11/performing-horizontal-eye-movement.html).

So, you bought a monitor because it was too big to fail, eh? Heh heh.

(PS couldn't you have measured the old one and, I don't know, read the product descriptions or something?)

(PPS you should be buying \_me\_ monitors, or at least small cat toys, with all this moolah that's burning a hole in your pocket.)

I remember when I first saw a monster of that size, walking into a friend's small, crammed room. I thought, if God speaks to us, he must be doing it through one of those.

Eh, you'll be used to it in 3 days, and every time you look at a 1024 x 768, you'll wonder how you ever lived with such primitive caveman technology. 

Incidentally (800 x 600) is still pretty frequently used as the common denominator for a lot of web development (at least it is in the cave where my boss's boss views my work). The job description mentioned nothing about painting angels on pinheads.

I suppose I should be grateful it's not 640 x 480. 

Oh yeah and since we're on the subject of laughably backwards customer requirements, recently a sizable banking conglomeration asked me to support IE5.

Not interested in that psychological mumbo jumbo. I really want to know if that monitor causes or cures cancer.

Sisyphus, it's not burning a hole in my pocket.  My monitor is a very important member of my financial team.  Without it, I cannot blog; without a blog, I cannot purchase a new monitor; without a new monitor, I cannot blog; without a blog ... you see the vicious cycle!  As for measuring the old one, I went into my computer's profile and copied the dimensions it gave me.  Apparently, my computer's into self-improvement (or is simply stupid).

Gas, if God starts speaking to me through _anything_ the only thing I'm going to be looking at is a blank wall in a mental institution.

Tom, I have my doubts.  When I walked out of the office this morning, I got the distinct impression that it was following me.  It doesn't scale properly, and it likely plotting my doom as I type.  I don't just stare at it, _it stares back at me_.  What's it thinking?  

Probably, to answer Naadir's question, how best to give me cancer.  ("Do I aim the radiation at his brain or his crotch?  Decisions, decisions ...")

IMHO, it's too big when, if you look at text at the right or left edges of the monitor, the angle makes it feel the same as if you were reading the screen of someone sitting at another computer right next to you.

become more creative through the power of bilateral symmetry.
Don't you mean bilateral asymmetry in this case?
