## Rumors of the reason behind my "demise" have been greatly exaggerated.

Sorry to lapse into silence again, but this time, I have reasons unrelated to untimely deaths:

*   I'm revising two dissertation chapters for publication/future job talks, as I'm hitting the market hard at the MLA this year. 
*   I'm still working on _Seeing Rhetoric_, but as the material I'm currently working on consists of revisions of [the lesson plans I've already posted](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2011/02/a-visual-rhetoric-compendium.html), I'm bereft of new material to post.  As soon as I'm finished revising and back into the production of new material, I'll be posting it.
*   Like everyone with a doctorate in English, I believe I have a novel in me, and the only time I can indulge in that fancy is during the summer.

Those are the _only three_ reasons posting has slowed to a crawl here and elsewhere, and anyone who says otherwise is engaging in what Twain once called "wrong and damnable conjecture."

I assumed you'd been arrested in the phone-hacking scandal.

I watch _Spooks_ and am confused by the swapping of SIM cards, so unless the police are investigating the literal knives-hacking of phones, you can be assured that I'm not involved.  (Though, pun-ironically, my phone's recently been nicked, which is like being knifed, only spelled differently.)

While I completely understand why you don't want to admit camping in line for eight days to get tickets to see _The Undefeated_, admitting you have a problem is the first step on the road to recovery.
