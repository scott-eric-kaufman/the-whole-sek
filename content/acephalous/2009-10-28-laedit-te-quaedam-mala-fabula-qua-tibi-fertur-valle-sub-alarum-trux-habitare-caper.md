			Because the world needs [more parodies](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTZkNDMxMTY3YzdkMzczMzc5OGI2YmZmYTNjNGIyZTg=) of Victor Davis Hanson:  
_Morituri te salutant_  

The Victory Column and _vero possumus_
megalomania of 2008 have now led to the deification of Obama as our new
Caesar, man of letters (who, in the ancient tradition, enslaved a
million in Gaul), and to his communications czar’s praising the
embattled Mao (her favorite “political philosopher”) for leading
China’s Communist legions to glorious victory over those running-dog
Nationalists. Add in the classical-column props at the convention and
the Moses-like talk about the seas’ receding and the planet’s cooling,
and I think this administration assumes we have a Holy Man in the White
House. And when you consider the depiction of Fox News as heresy, Rush
as the anti-Christ, and the NEA as the medieval church, it all gets,
well, sort of creepy.The above, of course, is renowned
military historian and classical scholar Victor Davis Hanson obliging
the world. He leads with a Latin quotation so esoteric only people who
have 
studied classical Latin oratory for decades
 
seen
 _Gladiator_
can recognize the import of its implied "Ave Obama." Or not. Trotting
out some of the only Latin his readers know means he needs a shoehorn
to make his metaphor relevant: who are the "saluting" folks "about to
die"? They are saluting Obama and are about to die for his
entertainment, so they can't be Joe Lieberman and the rest of the
Democratic Party, as that wouldn't entertain the President. They could
be Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck and Newt Gingrich, but
Victor Davis Hanson doesn't belong to the group of people currently
enjoying that particular spectacle (that would be _us_).  

See,
this is the problem with trotting out random bits of Latin in the
service of a hopelessly muddled metaphor: you think you're impressing
people who know _more_ than you, when in truth you're only impressing people who don't know Latin.

The only useful latin I know is from this limerick:

VDH, scholar, reflects  

on his diminutive organs of sex.  

Once caught for exposure,  

He said with composure,  

De minimis non curat lex!  

(the law will not deal with trivialities)

"Miniscule" would scan better than "diminutive."

Don't "minuscule" and "diminutive" scan exactly the same? min-US-cue-ul, dim-IN-you-tiv

No, it's MIN-us-cule.
