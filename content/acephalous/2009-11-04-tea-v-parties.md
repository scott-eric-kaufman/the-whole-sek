It must have been difficult to be a conservative last night. On the
one hand, you threw your muscle behind your perfect candidate and he
lost a district which last went Democratic back _before_ the [Half-Breeds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Breed\_%!p(MISSING)olitics%!)(MISSING) and the [Stalwarts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalwart\_%!p(MISSING)olitics%!)(MISSING) fought for control of the GOP; on the other, you got a television show made especially for you! The remake of _V_ is an exercise in allegorical drift-correction: the original series was supposed to be based on Sinclair Lewis's [novel about creeping government fascism](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/045121658X/diesekoschmar-20%!)(MISSING), which was itself an allegory about demagogic dangers posed by the likes of [Huey Long](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey\_Long) and [Father Coughlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles\_Coughlin), who were themselves perceived to be homegrown Hitlers, but then _Star Wars_
happened and the network demanded Space Nazis, so the fascists became
lizards and, instead of wanting to rule America, they wanted to eat
Americans, meaning they cured diseases for the same altruistic reasons
we pump cattle full of antibiotics. That, as they say in the business,
is some mighty powerful drift, and it requires some equally unsubtle
mastery to correct course.   

In the original series, the Nazi
parallel was made palpable via regalia and youth groups; in the remake,
they do so via a Maddow-esque [Scott Wolf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott\_Wolf)
asking the leader of the Visitors if they offer universal health care.
Note the slight shift in the assumption required to move from alien to
fascist? The [expert in fictional fascisms](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDU5YzUzZjVkYzU5M2I2NmZiYWEwOTU0YmQ2OWY5ZDE=) did:
I simultaneously loved the "universal health care" line and thought it was a bit hamfisted. I do like that it all [bothers Jonathan Chait so much](http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-plank/v-tea-party-tv-0),
but I think they could have been a bit more subtle. However, it's worth
recalling that the visitors in the original series promised to cure
diseases as well. I think Chait goes overboard too when he says the
show is a loveletter to the Tea Party movement.

Jonah
Goldberg is, it goes without saying, wrong, but in this case his error
is understandable because he was instrumental in creating the
conditions that made it possible. The _only_ people for whom universal health care signals a creeping fascism are 1) people who were convinced by the "[arguments](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/i-recognize-i-c.html)" proffered in _Liberal Fascism_,
and 2) people who believe Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin are the future of
the Republican Party. Granted, there is a substantial overlap between
those camps, but my point is that unless you share core beliefs with,
broadly speaking, the Tea Party movement, _that reference fails to refer_. The allegory 
only
 works if universal health care is a link in the chain that secures space lizards to fascism.

**UPDATE:** todd. [makes a suggestion](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/11/teavparties.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a654578f970b#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a654578f970b) and ([with one minor revision](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2009/11/teavparties.html?cid=6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a654788a970b#comment-6a00d8341c2df453ef0120a654788a970b))
I heartily agree. From now on, "JGIGWOSIW" it is. (If only because
that's the noise my brain makes when I read something he's written.)

"Jonah Goldberg is, it goes without saying, wrong"

That's so great that it should be how we always refer to Jonah Goldberg. Perhaps JGIIGWSW for short.

I'm thinking I ought to revise the sentence so it reads "Jonah Goldberg, it goes without saying, is wrong," because "JGIGWOSIW" is the noise my brain makes when I read something he's written.

Despite being an SF geek at the time, I never watched the original V, and never felt I missed much. In the meantime, [Gene Roddenberry's _Earth: Final Conflict_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth:\_Final\_Conflict) covered similar ground with much greater subtlety (I make no claims regarding the acting, however), despite Roddenberry being dead, and, honestly, not all that good at SF.

_The only people for whom universal health care signals a creeping fascism_

You left out this one ... people who watch Nancy Pelosi. Now tell me that lizard does not give you the creeps.
