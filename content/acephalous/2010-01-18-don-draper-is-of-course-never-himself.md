			Let me open with a quick clarification about [the previous _Mad Men_ post](http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2010/01/don-draper-as-unraptured-emma-bovary.html): as to the purview of self-fashioning, we all do it. In blog terms, you know me as [this guy](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/unbelievable-th.html), _i.e._ the one who [caught those students](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2005/11/my\_morning.html), made [that other one extremely uncomfortable](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/03/and\_yet\_i\_still.html), is [frequently victimized by the library](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/10/cashier.html), hid [his cancer from his wife](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2007/12/how-sek-hid-can.html), etc. Those are the stories I tell about myself to explain myself to myself. To quote Gertrude Stein from [_Everybody's Autobiography_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1878972081/diesekoschmar-20):  
Identity
is funny being yourself is funny as you are never yourself to yourself
except as you remember yourself and then of course you do not believe
yourself. That is really the trouble with an autobiography you do not
of course really believe yourself why should you, you know so well so
very well that it is not yourself, it could not be yourself because you
cannot remember right and if you do remember right it does not sound
right and of course it does not sound right because it is not right.
You are of course never yourself.The phrase "of course"
captures the central irony of all self-fashioning: we know, of course,
that we are more than the sum total of the stories we tell ourselves
about ourselves, and yet we only understand ourselves, and can only be
understood by others, through those stories. In case you ever wanted to
know why narrative diversity is important, there you have it: the more
narrative modes available, the more possible understandings of
themselves the people who encounter them can have.  

This is self-fashioning at its most mundane, and in terms of _Mad Men_,
this is why Peggy Olson becomes more modern: once she understands
herself in terms of the upwardly mobile career-oriented woman, the
audience understands her frustrations in terms of the conflict between
that meritocratic fantasy and the realities of being a woman in a
male-dominated working environment. She becomes more recognizably
modern not because the world she inhabits does, but because the way she
responds to that changing world elicits a chorus of "of courses."   

Neither
she nor Peter Campbell become "more real" as the series
progresses—fictional characters, being fictional, can only aspire to
escape the fictions they inhabit—but as the stories they tell
themselves about themselves in order to understand themselves come to
resemble ours, they'll seem more realistic because they're telling
themselves the same stories we tell ourselves and we, of course, live
in the real world. What I meant when I wrote the following, then, is
that Campbell is increasingly understanding himself in reference to the
same narratives we do, whereas Don Draper is not:  
Campbell is, in a sense, becoming _us_, and we revile his behavior to the extent that we recognize our sins in his actions. Draper, however, is becoming _art_,
and as such we hold him as responsible for his actions as we would Emma
Bovary. His self-fashioning was not merely based on literary precedent,
it was an act of literature, if you will, and much of the appeal of the
show is based on watching an inscrutable literary character interact
with actual humans.Draper's self-fashioning is not
remotely this mundane—it is radical. He envisions himself not in the
way a person envisions his or her self, but in the way an author
envisions a character, which is why Joseph Kugelmass [refers to it](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/i\_dont\_care\_what\_the\_critics\_say\_i\_love\_mad\_men\_and\_the\_sopranos\_and\_the\_hi/#comments) as _aesthetic_ self-fashioning. To a certain extent, this is how my blog functions, _i.e._
as a stylized version of the life I actually live and the person I
actually am; but because there are stories central to my conception of
myself that have not and will never make it on the blog, the person you
associate with my name will always feel, to me, like a persona. If _withholding_
certain core stories so alters the warp and woof of my persona that it
aestheticizes my self-fashioning, you can imagine what would happen
were I to start _inventing those stories whole cloth à la_ Draper.   

The
only people who know him on the show are the dead actors in his
increasingly frequent hallucinations, because only they have access to
his entire allotment of self-narratives—and, of course, they only have
that access because they _are_ the stories he tells himself
about himself. The audience is privy to some of them, but not the
entire store, which is why Draper remains ever at a remove. To the
extent that _Mad Men_ belongs to Draper, it is a story about
someone will never be able to integrate his stories with the ones he
wants told about him _even to himself_. His hallucinations
bully and hector him in order to remind him "that it does not sound
right and of course it does not sound right because it is not right,"
because the troubled antecedent of Stein's "it" is even more troubling
when the narratives that constitute identity are the convenient
inventions of an unsettled soul.  

If this conception of self-fashioning seems less _modern_ than _modernist_,
that would be my point: the manner in which Draper is integrating his
competing narratives into a semi-coherent sense of self is entirely
consonant with the modernist obsession with integrating competing
narratives into semi-coherent sense of self. From the unstable "I" in [Samuel Beckett's trilogy](http://www.blogger.com/%!C(MISSING)a%!h(MISSING)ref=) to the endless renegotiation of familial roles in [Joyce's _Ulysses_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141182806/diesekoschmar-20),
literary modernists sought to explode the tidy, reducible self that had
been the hallmark of literary realism. Draper is, then, something of an
exploded man sifting through bits of himself in search of the core to
which all these bits once belonged. However, until he accomplishes this
impossibility, his self-fashioning will still be far more aesthetic
than that of the other characters on _Mad Men_, and as such, the show's literate audience will still be drawn to him more than them.  

I keep on meaning for these _Mad Men_ posts to move beyond Draper so I can talk about Joan or visual rhetoric, but I can't quit Draper quite yet.

It's really past the point of saying now but this is so well done. Bravo.
