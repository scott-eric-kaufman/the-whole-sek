**Tuesday:**

The old, white math professor who teaches in the 
classroom before me did not release his students at 10:50, as he is 
supposed to. He did not release them at 11:00, when my class starts. At 
11:05, I entered my classroom to find a room full of students, fast 
asleep, and the old, white math professor silently working on a problem 
on the whiteboard. When I informed him that I needed the room, his 
students stirred and made for the door, but he pointed at me and said, 
"I need to finish this problem."

His students left.

He went back to work.

The old, white math professor continued to work at the far end of my 
classroom until 11:30, at which point he took out a notebook and copied 
what he'd written on the whiteboard. At 11:40 he noisily collected his 
books and markers and strode out of the room without a word.

This is because the old, white math professor is an asshole.

**Thursday:**

The old, white math professor again refused to leave the  room at 10:50, so today 
I
 _the dashing young lecturer_
 walked up to the podium and  began to prepare for his class. He asked 
the old, white math professor if he  was almost finished, but received 
no response.

At 11:00 a.m., the old,  white math professor picked up an eraser to 
correct some minor mistake on the  whiteboard, at which point the 
dashing young lecturer smiled broadly,  politely asked the old, white 
math professor if he needed help and, without  waiting for a reply, 
promptly began erasing the entire whiteboard.

The old, white math professor stared in horror at the dashing young 
lecturer -- who  hopes he didn't erase the cure for cancer, but is 
otherwise extremely  pleased with himself.

Probably time travel. This could be the source of all your trouble to date.
